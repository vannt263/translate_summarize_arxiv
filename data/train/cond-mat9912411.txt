    "the one - dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) was introduced by spitzer in 1970 as an example of an interacting stochastic process @xcite . in the probabilistic community",
    "it has been widely used for rigorous studies of the emergence of hydrodynamic behavior from stochastic microscopic dynamics @xcite .",
    "already thirty years ago similar models were considered in the context of biopolymerization @xcite , while recent applications have focused on the problem of vehicular traffic flow @xcite .",
    "the interest of statistical physicists has been further fueled by the discovery of boundary - induced phase transitions @xcite as well as the relations to interface growth and directed polymers in random media @xcite . in short , the asep is a generic model of driven single file transport which combines utmost simplicity with a remarkable richness of behaviors .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the model .",
    "particles occupy the sites of a one - dimensional lattice subject to the simple exclusion rule ( at most one particle per site ) . in an infinitesimal time interval",
    "@xmath0 particle @xmath1 at site @xmath2 attempts a jump to the right ( left ) with probability @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the jump succeeds if the neighboring site is empty and is suppressed otherwise . in general the jump rates",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 may depend on both the particle label @xmath1 and the position @xmath7 on the lattice . in much of the paper i will restrict myself to the _ totally _ asymmetric case @xmath8 .    in the present article",
    "i want to address the effects that _ quenched disorder _ in the jump rates has on the behavior of the asep .",
    "disorder effects can be quite dramatic in one - dimensional single file systems , as is evidenced by the everyday experience with platoons and traffic jams caused by slow vehicles , accidents or road construction on highways @xcite .",
    "also in the context of driven transport on biomolecules a certain amount of disorder seems unavoidable @xcite .",
    "it is natural to distinguish between _ particlewise disorder _ with @xmath9 , @xmath10 independent of @xmath7 , and _ sitewise disorder _ with @xmath11 , @xmath12 independent of @xmath1 .",
    "both particlewise and sitewise disorder generically induces _ phase separation _ in the sense that , for global particle densities @xmath13 in a certain interval @xmath14 $ ] , the system breaks up into regions of density @xmath15 and @xmath16 separated by sharp density discontinuities ( `` shocks '' ) .",
    "these shocks are typically associated with bottlenecks , i.e. slow particles or slow sites in the particlewise and sitewise cases , respectively .",
    "if the system is started from a homogeneous initial condition , the average size @xmath17 of phase separated regions grows as a power law @xmath18 defining a dynamic exponent @xmath19 ; an example of the time evolution in the particlewise case is shown in figure 2 .",
    "two kinds of questions will therefore be asked in the following : first , how can the density interval @xmath14 $ ] of phase separation be determined ?",
    "second , what is the value of the dynamic exponent , and how does it depend on the distribution of the disordered jump rates ?    for particlewise disorder",
    "a number of exact analytic results are available @xcite which have been reviewed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this case will therefore only be briefly summarized in section [ particle ] .",
    "the more difficult problem of sitewise disorder has been studied numerically by tripathy and barma @xcite and others @xcite , but little is known analytically . in section [ site ] some progress in this direction will be reported .",
    "specifically , i derive a rigorous bound on the critical densities based on the results for the particlewise case , and obtain predictions for the coarsening behavior for various types of disorder distributions . the relation to directed polymers in random media",
    "is briefly discussed in section [ dp ] , and some conclusions and open questions are formulated in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "for particlewise disorder the configurations of the system are most naturally described in terms of the _ headways _ @xmath20 in front of the particles .",
    "the key simplifying feature is that different headways become statistically independent in the steady state , with a geometric distribution @xcite @xmath21 for the headway in front of particle @xmath1 . in the totally asymmetric case",
    "the parameters @xmath22 are determined by the jump rates @xmath23 through the simple relation @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ( common ) mean speed of the particles in the steady state .",
    "eq.([alphai ] ) expresses the plausible fact that the headways in front of slow particles are larger than in front of fast ones .",
    "the geometric distribution ( [ pi ] ) remains valid in the case of partial asymmetry , but then ( [ alphai ] ) is replaced by a more complicated relation @xcite .",
    "the steady state distribution for the totally asymmetric model with parallel update has a similar form @xcite .    in the following",
    "we consider the totally asymmetric case and take the @xmath23 to be independent random variables with a probability density @xmath26 supported on the interval @xmath27 $ ] , with a minimal speed @xmath28 bounded away from zero . since particles can not pass each other , it is clear that the steady state speed @xmath25 in an infinite system can not exceed @xmath28 . to compute it",
    ", one determines the mean headway in front of particle @xmath1 from ( [ pi ] ) and performs the disorder average . in a system of density @xmath13",
    "the resulting average headway must be @xmath29 .",
    "this yields the implicit equation @xmath30^{-1}\\ ] ] for the speed as a function of density .",
    "two cases are to be distinguished .",
    "if the integral on the right hand side of ( [ v ] ) diverges in the limit @xmath31 , then @xmath32 for all @xmath33 . in this case",
    "the @xmath22 in ( [ pi ] ) are bounded away from unity for all @xmath1 , the headway distributions are normalizable , and the system remains homogeneous . if , on the other hand , the integral remains finite in this limit , then the right hand side of ( [ v ] ) evaluated at @xmath34 defines a critical density @xmath35 such that @xmath36 in the entire interval @xmath37 $ ] . for the slowest particles with @xmath38",
    "this implies that the headway distributions ( [ pi ] ) are no longer normalizable .",
    "large gaps appear in front of these particles , and the faster particles form platoons behind them , a phenomenon familiar from vehicular traffic on country roads @xcite . the system _ phase separates _ into regions of density @xmath39 ( the gaps ) and regions of density @xmath40 ( the platoons ) .    it is evident from ( [ v ] ) that the condition for phase separation translates into a condition on the behavior of the disorder distribution @xmath26 near @xmath41 . introducing an exponent @xmath42 through @xmath43 phase separation",
    "occurs iff @xmath44 . at the critical point",
    "@xmath45 the disorder averaged headway distribution has a power law tail @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "evans @xcite has emphasized the close analogy to bose - einstein condensation , where @xmath26 plays the role of a density of states , and the slowest particle in the system corresponds to the quantum mechanical ground state .",
    "no exact results pertaining to the dynamics of phase separation are available , apart from the observation @xcite that the existence of a well - defined hydrodynamic limit implies that inhomogeneities are restricted to scales smaller than @xmath47 , and therefore @xmath48 considerable evidence has however accumulated in favor of the idea @xcite that the coarsening behavior for particlewise disorder can be described in terms of a simpler , deterministic model , in which particles move ballistically on the real line with fixed random speeds and coalesce upon overtaking .",
    "such a model was first introduced by newell @xcite , and later a detailed kinetic theory was worked out by ben - naim , krapivsky and redner @xcite .    within the deterministic model , the dynamic exponent @xmath19 can be determined through a simple extremal statistics argument .",
    "the key idea is that the particles heading the platoons at time @xmath47 are those with the smallest speeds among of the order of @xmath49 particles .",
    "elementary probability theory suffices to show that , for a probability density behaving as ( [ n ] ) , these extremal speeds cluster in an interval of size @xmath50 above the minimal speed @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the speed difference @xmath51 between two platoons is of the order @xmath50 , and the faster platoon will merge with the slower one on a time scale @xmath52 .",
    "inverting this relation one obtains the coarsening law ( [ xi ] ) with @xmath53 numerical results supporting ( [ z(n ) ] ) have been reported for models with parallel update @xcite , in simulations of jam dissolution @xcite and in a simulation study of a system with open boundaries @xcite .",
    "we distinguish three cases which will turn out to represent different classes of coarsening behavior . for _ type i disorder _",
    "the dynamics is totally asymmetric , @xmath54 , and the forward rates @xmath55 are independent random variables in an interval @xmath27 $ ] , with a minimal rate @xmath56 .",
    "the simplest ( and typical ) example is that of binary rates , with probability density @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the fraction of slow sites . _",
    "type ii disorder _ is similar to type i except that the support of the probability density @xmath26 extends all the way to @xmath59 , i.e. the minimal rate @xmath60 . for type ii disorder",
    "nontrivial dynamics occurs only for continuous @xmath26 . as in the models with particlewise disorder ( eq.([n ] ) ) , the important feature of @xmath26 is the behavior near @xmath59 , which can be characterized by an exponent @xmath42 through the relation @xmath61    finally , for _ type iii _ disorder not only the strength , but also the direction of the bias is spatially random .",
    "a majority of sites has a bias to the right , say , with @xmath62 , while a minority has @xmath63 .",
    "if the one - dimensional lattice is viewed as a transport path in a higher - dimensional disordered structure , such as a percolation cluster , the stretches of minority sites can be interpreted as `` backbends '' where the path turns back against the direction of the driving field @xcite .",
    "compared to the strong disorder effects induced by the backbends , the randomness in the strength of the bias is irrelevant .",
    "therefore a representative example of type iii disorder is a model where the strength of the bias is constant , and only its direction varies .",
    "this corresponds to setting @xmath64 and choosing the @xmath55 from a binary distribution which is symmetric around @xmath65 , @xmath66 here @xmath67 denotes the strength of the bias and @xmath68 the fraction of minority sites .",
    "it is easy to see that for type ii and iii disorder the stationary particle current vanishes in the infinite system limit , due to the existence of arbitrarily large stretches of arbitrarily small jump rates ( for type ii ) or arbitrarily long backbends ( for type iii ) . as a consequence phase separation occurs at any density @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath70 . for type",
    "i disorder the existence of a nontrivial current function @xmath71 describing the large scale dynamics of density profiles has been rigorously established , and it has been shown that @xmath72 is convex in the sense that @xmath73 @xcite . however , in contrast to the models with particlewise disorder the stationary state is not known , and therefore an explicit computation of @xmath72 is not possible . in the next section some bounds on @xmath72 will be derived and used to bound the critical densities for type i disorder .",
    "the coarsening dynamics for all three cases will be addressed in section [ sitecoarse ] .",
    "we first collect some obvious properties of @xmath72 . due to particle - hole symmetry",
    "we have @xmath74 .",
    "the current is bounded from below by the current @xmath75 of a pure system with all rates equal to the minimal rate @xmath28 , and from above by the current @xmath76 of the system with all rates equal to unity . a more precise upper bound",
    "is obtained by observing that in the infinite system there are arbitrarily large stretches with rates arbitrarily close to @xmath28 .",
    "the maximum current that can be driven through such a stretch is @xmath77 , the maximum value of @xmath75 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath78.\\ ] ]    numerical simulations of site - disordered exclusion models @xcite and related growth models @xcite indicate that the upper bound @xmath77 is attained in a finite density interval around @xmath79 , which coincides with the phase separation interval @xmath80 $ ] ; by particle - hole symmetry @xmath81 . in the following our strategy will be to derive optimal lower and upper bounds @xmath82 and @xmath83 on the stationary current , which are then translated into lower and upper bounds @xmath84 , @xmath85 on @xmath35 through the relation @xmath86 the lower current bound in ( [ jbound1 ] ) does not give rise to any nontrivial density bound , while the upper bound @xmath76 yields @xmath87    for the case of binary disorder ( eq.([binary ] ) ) an improved lower bound on the current was derived by tripathy and barma @xcite by considering a finite ring of @xmath88 sites , @xmath89 particles and @xmath90 slow sites .",
    "they start from the observation that the maximum current that can be driven through a stretch of slow sites is a decreasing function of the length of the stretch ( we will return to this point below in section [ sitecoarse ] ) .",
    "it is therefore plausible ( though not rigorously established ) that for given @xmath88 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 the stationary current will be minimal in the fully segregated limit where all slow sites form a single large stretch . for @xmath93",
    "the fully segregated system can be treated as two connected homogeneous systems with different densities , which are fixed through the constraints of equal currents and total particle number .",
    "this yields the upper density bound @xmath94 in the dilute limit @xmath95 the bounds ( [ rholow1 ] ) and ( [ fss ] ) coincide , and give @xmath96 exactly .",
    "it should however be noted that this limit does _ not _ correspond to the case of a single defect site , since the maximal current that can be driven through a single defect is larger than @xmath77 @xcite ( see also section [ sitecoarse ] ) .",
    "the lower bound ( [ rholow1 ] ) can be improved by comparing the disordered exclusion model to a _ zero range process _",
    "( zrp ) with the same set of jump rates @xmath97 . in the zrp",
    "an arbitrary number of particles is allowed on any site @xcite , and therefore any attempted jump succeeds . as a consequence",
    "the stationary state of the zrp is a product measure , with the occupation numbers at different sites being independent , for any choice of jump rates depending on the position @xmath7 and on the number of particles at the site @xcite .",
    "here we consider the case where the rate at which a particle is transferred from site @xmath7 to @xmath98 is equal to @xmath55 independent of the number of particles at @xmath7 , provided the latter is not zero .",
    "it is then obvious ( and can be proved through waiting time considerations ) that the particle current @xmath99 of the zrp provides an upper bound to the current @xmath72 of the asep .",
    "in fact the disordered zrp is equivalent to the asep with _ particlewise _",
    "disorder , with the zrp occupation numbers representing the headways in the asep @xcite .",
    "the zrp current is equal to the particle speed @xmath25 of the asep , which is given by ( [ v ] ) for any disorder distribution @xmath26 .",
    "the zrp density is equal to the mean headway of the asep , and is therefore related to the asep density through @xmath100 .",
    "evaluating the integral in ( [ v ] ) for the binary distribution ( [ binary ] ) yields @xmath101 and setting @xmath102 in ( [ rhobounds ] ) we obtain the density bound @xmath103 which improves ( [ rholow1 ] ) for small @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath104 we have @xmath105 , which proves , remarkably , that the homogeneous phase @xmath106 persists even when the slow sites become complete blockages . in figure 3 the bounds ( [ rholow1 ] ) , ( [ fss ] ) and ( [ rhozrp ] )",
    "are compared to numerical data .",
    "at least for type i disorder the existence of a hydrodynamic limit @xcite implies that the relation ( [ sublinear ] ) carries over to the sitewise case . to obtain a finer estimate of the coarsening scale @xmath49 we rely on extremal statistics arguments similar to those used in section [ parcoarse ] . a schematic phase separated density profile is shown in figure 4 .",
    "two `` antischocks '' at positions @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where the density jumps from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , mark _ bottleneck _ regions of particularly slow rates , which support maximum currents @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "if the bottleneck in the downstream direction is slightly more restrictive , in the sense that @xmath113 , then the low density region between the bottlenecks will slowly fill in and disappear at a time @xmath114 if the statistics of extremal bottlenecks is known , the typical current difference @xmath115 can be estimated as a function of @xmath17 and ( [ bottleneck ] ) yields a prediction for the coarsening law @xmath49 . in the following this",
    "will be carried out for the different disorder types .",
    "consider first the conceptually simplest case of the binary disorder distribution ( [ binary ] ) .",
    "we expect long stretches of slow sites to constitute the most restrictive bottlenecks . for a quantitative analysis",
    "we would require the maximum current @xmath116 which can be driven through a stretch of @xmath117 slow sites with jump rates @xmath28 embedded in an infinite system of sites with jump rates 1 .",
    "already for @xmath118 the computation of @xmath116 is a difficult unsolved problem @xcite .",
    "however for large @xmath117 we can make progress by replacing the stretch by a finite system of @xmath117 sites with uniform jump rates @xmath28 and periodic or open boundary conditions , for which the maximum current is known @xcite . for both kinds of boundary conditions",
    "the current approaches the @xmath119 limit @xmath77 from above , with a leading correction @xcite proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "thus we expect , for large @xmath117 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a positive constant of order unity .",
    "since the probability distribution of the lengths of slow stretches is @xmath123 the longest stretch in a region of size @xmath17 is of the order of @xmath124 note that @xmath125 , which is consistent with the assumption of well - localized bottlenecks inherent in figure 4 . using ( [ jmax ] )",
    "we see that the currents supported by the longest stretches exceed @xmath77 by an amount of the order of @xmath126 , and therefore @xmath127 inserting this into ( [ bottleneck ] ) the leading order coarsening law is obtained as @xmath128 with a characteristic time scale @xmath129 .",
    "this argument was formulated earlier in the context of phase - disordered growth models , where also numerical evidence in favor of the coarsening law ( [ xii ] ) was presented @xcite .    for continuous disorder distributions @xmath26",
    "the identification of the relevant bottlenecks is a little more subtle . consider a region of size @xmath117 where all rates satisfy @xmath130 .",
    "the maximum current through such a region can then be estimated as @xmath131 if @xmath26 behaves as in ( [ n ] ) for @xmath132 the probability of the region is of the order of @xmath133 .",

    ", the expression ( [ jmaxcont ] ) for the maximum current supported by a slow stretch of length @xmath117 applies with @xmath141 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath142 then becomes @xmath143 @xmath144.\\ ] ] now the maximum of the exponent evidently occurs at @xmath118 , i.e. the dominant bottlenecks are _ individual slow sites_. the distribution of the currents supported by the bottlenecks is then simply given by the jump rate distribution @xmath26 itself , and the situation reduces to that analyzed in the case of particlewise disorder , section [ parcoarse ] . in particular , the coarsening exponent @xmath19 for type ii sitewise disorder is also given by ( [ z(n ) ] ) .    for type iii disorder with distribution ( [ binary2 ] )",
    "the dominant bottlenecks are long backbends , i.e. stretches of minority sites at which the local bias is directed against the mean flow direction .",
    "the maximum current that can be driven through a backbend of length @xmath117 is exponentially small in @xmath117 , and is given by @xcite @xmath145.\\ ] ] combining this with the probability distribution ( [ pl ] ) of backbend lengths it follows that @xmath146 is distributed according to a power law , @xmath147 where @xmath148}{\\ln[1/\\phi]}.\\ ] ] since the largest backbend in a region of size @xmath17 is of length @xmath149 , we can employ a coarse grained picture in which the backbends are shrunk to individual sites with a jump rate distribution given by ( [ jmaxiii ] ) , thus effectively reducing the problem to type ii disorder with the exponent @xmath42 in ( [ n2 ] ) given by @xmath150 . the coarsening exponent for the disorder distribution ( [ binary2 ] )",
    "is then obtained from ( [ z(n ) ] ) as @xmath151      using the waiting time approach @xcite the site disordered asep can be mapped to a zero temperature directed polymer ( dp ) with point and columnar disorder @xcite . in that context",
    "the coarsening law @xmath49 describes the disorder - induced transverse wandering of the polymer , which can be estimated using variable range hopping arguments @xcite and the analogy to lifshitz tails for one - dimensional disordered schrdinger operators @xcite .    to see that the results derived for the dp are consistent with those obtained above , it is important the recall @xcite that the waiting time mapping transforms the time @xmath47 of the asep into the _ energy _ of dp . for type",
    "i disorder the transverse wandering @xmath152 of the dp was found to increase with its length @xmath88 as @xcite @xmath153 while the ground state energy behaves as @xmath154 to leading order . combining the two results and identifying @xmath155 the coarsening law ( [ xii ] ) follows .    for type ii disorder the power law ( [ n2 ] ) of the probability distribution at small",
    "@xmath5 translates into a power law tail @xmath156 in the distribution of waiting times or energies @xmath157 .",
    "directed polymers in the presence of columnar disorder with a power law distribution were considered in ref.@xcite , where it was shown that the wandering is typically ballistic , @xmath158 , while the ground state energy scales with length as @xmath159 in agreement with ( [ z(n ) ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that in the dp context the scaling laws ( [ dx1 ] ) and ( [ el ] ) were also confirmed numerically @xcite .",
    "in this paper i have described some recent progress in our understanding of disorder effects in asymmetric simple exclusion models .",
    "a common feature of both particlewise and sitewise disordered systems is the appearance of phase separation in an interval of densities , which is _ macroscopically _ characterized by a linear portion in the current - density relation @xmath72 ; in the particlewise case @xmath160 for @xmath106 , while in the sitewise case @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "an interesting open question concerns the connection between phase separation and linearity of @xmath72 , which is reminiscent of the role that the convexity of thermodynamical potentials plays for the stability of equilibrium systems . while it is obvious that phase separation implies a linear segment in @xmath72 , the converse statement has , to my knowledge , not been established . to prove that it is false , it would be sufficient to find a ( noisy ! ) exclusion type model with a homogeneous stationary state and a linear current - density relation ( deterministic systems with linear @xmath72 are well known @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of phase separation has been explored in the framework of scaling arguments , which can be formulated in a similar way both for particlewise and sitewise disorder . in the particlewise case",
    "the relevant bottlenecks which determine the positions of domain boundaries are always individual slow particles , while in the sitewise case with type i and iii disorder the bottlenecks are formed collectively by many defects . for type",
    "i disorder this implies a certain _ universality _ of the coarsening law , in the sense that the exponent @xmath19 in ( [ xi ] ) is @xmath163 independent of the underlying disorder distribution ; the additional logarithmic corrections in ( [ xii],[xiii ] ) ensure the consistency with the rigorous result ( [ sublinear ] ) .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to the case of _ finite temperature _ directed polymers with columnar defects , where universal scaling laws arise from the thermal averaging over large spatial regions @xcite .",
    "a numerical confirmation of the predictions for the coarsening dynamics in the case of sitewise disorder would be most welcome . for type ii disorder",
    "this should be relatively straightforward , however in the cases of type i and iii disorder the behavior is dominated by exponentially rare regions , which may make it hard to reach asymptopia .",
