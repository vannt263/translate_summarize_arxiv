    "the idea that gravitational field equations could be interpreted using ( or derived from ) thermodynamic arguments has been explored by many people from widely different perspectives .",
    "( see e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "there is a tendency in the literature to club together these  very different  attempts as essentially the same or , at least , as very similar .",
    "such a point of view is technically incorrect , and given this tendency , it is useful to clarify the differences between the various approaches , as regards their assumptions , physical motivation and the generality of the results .",
    "i will begin with a series of comments aimed at this task :    * to begin with , one must sharply distinguish between ( i ) the attempts concerned with the _ derivation _ of the field equations by thermodynamic arguments ( like e.g. , @xcite ) and ( ii ) the attempts related to the _ interpretation _ of the field equations in a thermodynamic language ( like e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is as important as the former because the existence of a purely thermodynamic interpretation for the field equations is vital for the overall consistency of the programme .",
    "it is rather self - defeating to derive the field equations @xmath3 from thermodynamic arguments and then interpret them in the usual geometrical language !",
    "if gravity is thermodynamic in nature , then the gravitational field equations must be expressible in a _",
    "thermodynamic _ language .",
    "this crucial feature has not been given due recognition in the literature .",
    "unless the final result has an interpretation in thermodynamic language , such a derivation of the field equations is conceptually rather incongruous . + as an example of what i mean by such an interpretation , let me recall the following result .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the evolution of geometry can be interpreted in thermodynamic terms , as the heating and cooling of null surfaces , through the equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the degrees of freedom in the surface @xmath6 and bulk @xmath7 of a 3-dimensional region and @xmath8 is the average davies - unruh temperature @xcite of the boundary .",
    "the @xmath9 is the induced metric on the @xmath10 constant surface , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the proper - time evolution vector corresponding to observers moving with four - velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the factor @xmath14 ensures the correct result for either sign of the komar energy @xmath15 .",
    "the time evolution of the metric in a region ( described by the left hand side of ) , can be interpreted @xcite as the heating / cooling of the spacetime and arises because @xmath16 . in any _ static _ spacetime @xcite , on the other hand , @xmath17 , leading to `` holographic equipartition '' : @xmath18 .",
    "this result translates gravitational dynamics into the thermal evolution of the spacetime .",
    "the validity of for all observers ( i.e. , foliations ) ensures the validity of einstein s equations .",
    "+ in fact , _ no _ thermodynamic derivation of the field equations in the literature actually obtains the _ tensorial _ form of field equation @xmath19 . what is",
    "always done _ is to obtain an equation of the form @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is either a timelike or null vector ) and postulate its validity for all @xmath21 .",
    "so it is important to understand the physical meaning of such an equation , especially the left hand side , for a given class of @xmath21 .",
    "this will be a recurrent theme which i will elaborate on later sections . *",
    "many thermodynamic derivations of field equations available in the literature , work with the assumption that the entropy of a horizon is proportional to its area ( e.g. , @xcite ) and attempt to introduce thermodynamic arguments centered around it .",
    "_ it is likely that such derivations miss some essential physics . _ the connection between gravity and thermodynamics , motivated historically from the laws of black hole mechanics @xcite and the membrane paradigm @xcite , transcends einstein s theory . in a more general class of theories ,",
    "the ( wald ) entropy @xcite of the horizon is _ not _ proportional to its area .",
    "one should therefore distinguish approaches in this subject which are specially tuned to einstein gravity ( and uses the entropy - area proportionality ) from a broader class of approaches ( like e.g. @xcite ) because the latter ones , being more general , probably capture the underlying physics better .",
    "the above criticism is also valid for approaches based on entanglement entropy when it is assumed to be proportional to the horizon area . *",
    "another feature which distinguishes different approaches in the literature is whether the field equations are derived from a variational principle or from some other procedure .",
    "i am personally in favour of approaches which use a variational principle because they could offer a better window into microscopic physics .",
    "what is more , the approaches which does _ not _ use a variational principle are very limited in their scope .",
    "for example , it is virtually impossible to generalize such models beyond einstein s theory .",
    "( in contrast , the very first approach which used a thermodynamic variational principle to derive the field equations @xcite , obtained the field equations for all  models at one go . ) some of these approaches like , for example , those which use the raychaudhuri equation also have non - trivial technical issues @xcite .",
    "+ even amongst the approaches which use variational principles , we need to distinguish between ( i ) those which vary the geometry ( viz .",
    ", the metric in some form , sometimes in a rather disguised manner ) and ( ii ) those which vary some auxiliary vector field , keeping the metric fixed .",
    "many approaches involving holographic concepts and entanglement entropy do vary the geometry in some form ; however , i prefer approaches which vary an auxiliary vector .",
    "( after all , if you are going to vary the metric / geometry in an extremum principle , why not just use the einstein - hilbert action and be done with it  ? ! ) an example @xcite of an extremum principle which does _ not _ vary the metric , is given by the functional @xmath22\\right ) \\label{qtotyy}\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the shear and expansion of a null congruence @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the shear and bulk viscous coefficients of a null fluid @xcite and the integrand can be interpreted as the rate of generation of heat ( ` dissipation without dissipation ' ; see @xcite ) due to matter and gravity on a null surface . varying @xmath27 with respect to @xmath28 and demanding that the extremum should hold for all @xmath28 ( i.e. , for all null surfaces ) will lead to einstein s equations .",
    "( we will say more about this in sec .",
    "[ sec : dwd ] . ) such a variational principle  and others of a similar genre which we will discuss later  treat the geometry as fixed and does not vary the metric .",
    "* at a more fundamental level , the horizon entropy can not be finite unless some kind of discreteness exists in the spacetime near planck scales .",
    "this is clear in the case of entanglement entropy , which is a manifestly divergent quantity ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and needs to be regularized by some ad - hoc cut - off ; but it is implicit in all approaches .",
    "so , unless we have a model which captures _ at least some of _ the quantum gravitational effects on the spacetime , any derivation of the field equations using a finite value for entropy is , at best , incomplete .",
    "* finally , let me emphasize that _ gravity can not be an entropic force_. this was ably demonstrated by matt visser @xcite by an argument which uses ( essentially ) elementary vector analysis .",
    "it is trivial to prove , in the newtonian limit , that a conservative force @xmath29 can not , in general , be expressed in the entropic form @xmath30 if @xmath31 is the davies - unruh temperature that depends on the magnitude of the acceleration @xmath32 .",
    "the relation @xmath33 implies that the level surfaces of @xmath34 coincide with those of @xmath35 , allowing us to introduce a function @xmath36 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath37 and hence the level surface of @xmath34 coincide with the level surfaces of @xmath31 .",
    "but since @xmath31 depends only on @xmath32 , this requires the level surfaces of @xmath32 to coincide with those of @xmath34 .",
    "this condition is , in general , impossible to satisfy and can happen only in situations of high symmetry ( for example , spherical , cylindrical , planar etc . )",
    ". it would be preferable if the phrase `` entropic gravity '' is _ not used as a rather generic term _ to describe the different approaches in this subject , for the simple reason that gravity can not be an entropic force .    to summarize , there exist many different attempts in the literature to link gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "all of these are _ not _ equivalent  either conceptually or technically  and it is also likely that at least some of them are fundamentally flawed or incomplete .",
    "the approach i have been pursuing  which i will describe here  is marked by the following features : ( 1 ) much of it works for a wide class of theories , more general than einstein s gravity .",
    "in particular , the results hold for theories in which entropy is _ not _ proportional to horizon area .",
    "( 2 ) the field equations are derived from a thermodynamic extremum principle in which the geometry is not varied but some other auxiliary vector field is varied .",
    "( 3 ) the resulting field equations are interpreted in a thermodynamic language and not in a geometric language .",
    "( 4 ) the introduction of a zero - point length to the spacetime by quantum gravitational effects allows us to provide a microscopic basis for the variational principle which is used .    here",
    ", i will concentrate on developing this perspective _ from first principles _ in a streamlined manner .",
    "obviously this will require us to make some educated guesses but i shall argue that these guesses are well - motivated and the results are quite rewarding . in particular , i will describe the following two aspects :    * i will demonstrate @xcite a deep connection between two aspects of gravity which are usually considered in the literature to be quite distinct .",
    "the first is the fact that gravity seems to be immune to the shift in the zero level of the energy , i.e , to the shift in the value of cosmological constant .",
    "second is the feature i mentioned above , viz . , gravitational dynamics can be reinterpreted in a purely thermodynamic language .",
    "i will show how the first feature _ leads to _ the second and , in fact , provides a simple and natural motivation to consider the heat density of the null surfaces as a key physical entity .",
    "* much of the previous work treated the spacetime as analogous to a fluid and investigated its properties in the _",
    "thermodynamic limit_. the next , deeper , level of description of a fluid will be the _ kinetic theory _ which recognizes the discreteness and quantifies it in terms of a distribution function for its molecules .",
    "i will describe an attempt @xcite to do the same for the spacetime by introducing a distribution function for the atoms of spacetime ( which will count the microscopic degrees of freedom ) and relating it to the extremum principle which , in turn , will lead to the field equations .",
    "the principle of equivalence , along with principle of general covariance , strongly suggest that gravity is the manifestation of a curved spacetime and will set @xmath38 so that @xmath39 .",
    "occasionally , i will also set @xmath40 when no confusion is likely to arise .",
    "] , described by a non - trivial metric @xmath41 .",
    "the _ kinematics _ of gravity , viz .",
    "how a given gravitational field affects matter , can then be determined by postulating the validity of special relativistic dynamics in all freely falling frames .",
    "this will lead to the condition @xmath42 for the energy momentum tensor of matter , which encodes the influence of gravity on matter .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any equally elegant guiding principle to determine the _ dynamics _ of gravity , viz . how matter determines the evolution of the spacetime metric .",
    "the dynamics is contained in the gravitational field equation , which  in einstein s theory  is assumed to be given by @xmath3 .",
    "( in a more general class of theories , like e.g ,  models , the left hand side will be replaced by a more complicated second rank , symmetric , divergence - free tensor . )",
    "one can obtain this equation , as einstein did , by ( i ) assuming that the right hand side _ must _ be @xmath43 and ( ii ) by constructing a second rank , symmetric , divergence - free tensor from the metric containing upto second derivatives .",
    "alternatively , as hilbert did , one can write down a suitable scalar lagrangian and vary it with respect to the metric and obtain the field equations .    in either procedure",
    ", one tacitly assumes that the spacetime metric is a dynamical variable with a status similar to , say , that of the gauge potential @xmath44 in electromagnetism .",
    "this belief is based on the fact that einstein s equation is a second order differential equation for the metric just as maxwell s equation is a second order differential equation for @xmath44 .",
    "it is in the same spirit that we justify varying the metric in the hilbert action ( as analogous to varying @xmath44 in the electromagnetic action ) to obtain einstein s equation .",
    "further , once we have a classical action @xmath45 $ ] in which @xmath46 is varied to get the field equations , it is tempting to think of a quantum theory , defined through a path integral over @xmath47 $ ] ( or in some other equivalent manner ) with the metric playing the role of a quantum variable .",
    "but , given the fact that spacetime geometry is conceptually very different from an external field propagating in it , this assumption  viz .",
    ", that the metric is a dynamical variable similar to other fields  is indeed nontrivial .",
    "further , if varying the metric in the hilbert action is _ not _ the appropriate way to obtain the classical theory , then one is forced to think afresh about all the quantum gravity programmes .",
    "interestingly enough , this textbook procedure  of treating the metric as a dynamical variable , accepted without a second thought  is by no means a unique way to obtain einstein s equation .",
    "in fact , it is probably _ not _ the most natural or efficient procedure .",
    "one can come up with alternative approaches _ and physically motivated extremum principles , _ leading to einstein s equation , in which the metric is _ not _ a dynamical variable .",
    "let me describe one such approach .",
    "the field equations we seek should be a relativistic generalization of newton s law of gravity @xmath48 . a natural way of generalizing this law is to begin by noticing that : ( i ) the energy density in the right hand side @xmath49 is foliation / observer dependent where @xmath50 is the four velocity of an observer .",
    "there is no way we can keep @xmath50 out of it .",
    "( ii ) we know from the principle of equivalence that @xmath46 plays the role of @xmath51 .",
    "so a covariant , scalar generalization of the left hand side , @xmath52 , could come from the curvature tensor  which contains the second derivatives of the metric .",
    "any such generalization _ must depend on the four - velocity @xmath50 of the observer _ since the right hand side does .",
    "( iii ) it is perfectly acceptable for the left hand side _ not _ to have second _ time _ derivatives of the metric , in the rest frame of the observer , since they do not occur in @xmath52 .    to obtain a scalar analogous to @xmath52 , having _ spatial _ second derivatives , we first project the indices of @xmath53 to the space orthogonal to @xmath50 , using the projection tensor @xmath54 , thereby obtaining the tensor @xmath55 .",
    "the only scalar we can get from @xmath56 is @xmath57 where @xmath58 can be thought of as the radius of curvature of the space . and",
    "@xmath58 should _ not _ to be confused with the curvature tensor @xmath59 and the curvature scalar @xmath60 of the 3-space orthogonal to @xmath50 . ] the natural generalization of newton s law @xmath48",
    "is then given by @xmath61 .",
    "working out the left hand side ( see e.g. , p. 259 of @xcite ) and fixing the proportionality constant from the newtonian limit , one finds that @xmath62 if this scalar equation should hold for all observers ( general covariance ) then we need @xmath63 which is the standard result . demanding that @xmath64 holds for each observer , captures the geometric statement  viz . that energy density curves space as viewed by any observer",
    " in a nice manner and is indeed the most natural generalization of newton s law : @xmath48 .",
    "so , in this approach , the fundamental equation determining the geometry is  which should hold for all normalized , timelike vectors @xmath50 at each event of spacetime  rather than the standard equation @xmath63 . while the two formulations are algebraically equivalent , they are conceptually rather different . in the conventional approach to derive @xmath63 , we do not invoke any special class of observers",
    "instead , we _ assume _ that the right hand side of the field equation _ must _ be @xmath43 and look for a generally covariant , divergence - free , second - rank tensor built from geometry to put on the left hand side .",
    "( alternatively , we look for a scalar lagrangian made from geometrical variables ) .",
    "but the source in newtonian gravity is actually @xmath65 which _ does _ involve an extra four - velocity for its definition . if we introduce observers with four - velocity @xmath50  and in the end demand that the equation should hold for all @xmath50  we obtain the same gravitational field equations by a different route .",
    "this approach to _ dynamics _ brings it closer to the way we handled the _",
    "kinematics _ by introducing the freely falling observers .",
    "the real importance of this approach stems from the fact that it allows us to construct a different kind of extremum principles which will lead to the gravitational field equations , _ without treating the metric as a dynamical variable ! _",
    "since this approach introduces an extra vector field @xmath66 into the fray , one can consider an extremum principle in which we vary @xmath50  which makes physical sense in terms of changing the observer  instead of the metric .",
    "it is now possible , for example , to obtain the field equations by varying @xmath50 in a variational principle with the lagrangian @xmath67 and demanding that the extremum must hold for all @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , we can also use the lagrangian @xmath68 .",
    "varying @xmath66 in the resulting action , after imposing the constraint @xmath69 and demanding that the extremum should hold for all @xmath50 , will lead to the equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the lagrange multiplier . using the bianchi identity and @xmath42 , we will recover the field equations except for an undetermined cosmological constant @xcite . removing a total divergence from @xmath72",
    ", we see that this is equivalent to a variational principle based on the functional term ) but , of course , here we are varying the vector field @xmath50 and _ not _ the metric @xmath73 .",

    ", you get an evolution equation for @xmath77 . here",
    "we vary @xmath75 in but get the equation constraining @xmath46 ! this comes about because , after varying @xmath75 , we demand that the equation hold for all @xmath75 to take care of all observers .",
    "( recall that this is also done in _ all _ attempts to derive field equations by thermodynamic arguments . ) while conceptually different from the usual extremum principles , it is perfectly well - defined and makes physical sense .",
    "] so , one can indeed obtain the classical field equations for gravity _ without varying the metric _ in any action principle .",
    "the existence of such alternative variational principles takes away the motivation to treat the metric as a dynamical variable either classically or quantum mechanically . if this alternative procedure  or a variant of it",
    " is the correct interpretation of classical gravity , then the hilbert action has no meaning classically ( and hence in a quantum mechanical path integral ) . in the classical theory ,",
    "what ultimately matters is the field equation and the rest is just window dressing .",
    "but the distinction between these two approaches is vital when we want to bring together the principles of quantum theory and gravity . if the metric is not a dynamical variable in the classical theory",
    " and the correct classical variational principle involves varying some other auxiliary variable like @xmath50 rather than the metric  it makes no sense to quantise the metric . such an attempt will , at best , be similar to quantizing the velocity or density field of a material medium . while gravitons will emerge with the same conceptual status as , say , phonons , the attempt will not lead to a complete quantum description of the spacetime .",
    "so , the alternative paradigm suggests a completely different picture about the quantum nature of spacetime .",
    "this point of view , that the metric is not a dynamical variable , receives independent support from the tantalizing relationship between gravitational dynamics and the thermodynamics of null surfaces . as i mentioned earlier",
    ", one can provide a purely thermodynamic interpretation to quite easily but _ not _ to @xmath3 .",
    "we need the extra vector field @xmath66 for this interpretation , just as we need it to define an energy density .",
    "we will see later that the situation is still better when we use a null vector in place of the timelike vector .",
    "one major problem with the conventional approach to gravitational dynamics is that we lack a good guiding principle to determine the field equations .",
    "my first task is to take care of this .",
    "i will begin by postulating a guiding principle @xcite , which turns out to be as powerful as the principle of equivalence , in obtaining the gravitational dynamics .",
    "let us recall that the equations of motion for matter , derived from an action principle , remain invariant if we add a constant to the matter lagrangian , _",
    "i.e. _ , under the change @xmath78 constant .",
    "this encodes the principle that the zero level of energy density does not affect the dynamics .",
    "motivated by this fact , it seems reasonable to postulate that the gravitational field equations should not break this symmetry , which is already present in the matter sector . since @xmath79 will occur , in one form or another , as the source for gravity ( as can be argued from the principle of equivalence and considerations of the newtonian limit ) , we postulate that :    * the extremum principle that determines the dynamics of spacetime must be invariant under the change @xmath80 ( constant ) @xmath81 .",
    "this principle leads to two useful results :    first , this principle rules out the possibility of varying the metric tensor @xmath46 in a covariant , local , action principle to obtain the field equations ! it is easy to prove @xcite that if ( i ) the action is obtained from a local , covariant lagrangian integrated over a region of spacetime with the covariant measure @xmath82 and ( ii ) the field equations are obtained through unrestricted variation fixed ; i do not think we have a sound physical motivation for this approach .",
    "] of the metric in the action , then the field equations _ can not _",
    "remain invariant under @xmath80 ( constant ) @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , @xmath78 constant is no longer a symmetry transformation of the action if the metric is treated as the dynamical variable .",
    "therefore , any variational principle we come up with can not have @xmath46 as the dynamical variable .    as i highlighted in the last section , this need not scare us ; it is certainly possible to come up with variational principles leading to the field equations in which the metric is not a dynamical variable .",
    "this brings us to the second result : the most natural structure , built from @xmath43 , which maintains the required invariance under @xmath80 ( constant ) @xmath81 , is given by @xmath83 \\equiv t_{ab } \\ell^a \\ell^b \\label{qtot}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is a null vector .-",

    "while the right hand side of ( @xmath93 ) changes under @xmath80 ( constant ) @xmath81 , the right hand side of ( @xmath94 ) remains invariant , which is what we want .",

    "but @xmath103 is the energy density for _ any _ kind of @xmath43 , not just for that of an ideal fluid .",

    "( b ) the @xmath43 should appear in the extremum principle though the combination @xmath288 where @xmath84 is a null vector .",
    "* we next look for a physical interpretation of @xmath289 for an arbitrary @xmath43 and find that , in any spacetime , the local rindler observers will interpret @xmath289 as the heat density contributed to a null surface by the matter crossing it .",
    "this interpretation works for _ any _ @xmath43 and provides a strong _ motivation _ for introducing local rindler observers in the spacetime . * since ( i ) the metric can not be a dynamical variable and ( ii ) we now have the auxiliary null vector field @xmath84 arising through @xmath289 , we look for an extremum principle in which @xmath84 is varied .",
    "the extremum should hold for all null vectors at any event and constrain the background metric .",
    "* we take the integrand of the extremum principle to be @xmath290 where @xmath291 is interpreted as the heat density due to the microscopic spacetime degrees of freedom .",
    "we have introduced a length scale @xmath131 from dimensional considerations and @xmath1 is the dimensionless count of the microscopic degrees of freedom . *",
    "a discrete count for the microscopic degrees of freedom implies a discrete nature for spacetime at planck scales .",
    "we incorporate this fact by an effective , renormalized / dressed metric @xmath161 which ensures that the geodesic distance of the effective metric has a zero - point length and is given by @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the geodesic distance of the classical spacetime .",
    "we take @xmath294 .",
    "* the number of spacetime degrees of freedom , at an event , is taken to be proportional to the area of an equi - geodesic surface centered at that event in the limit of vanishing geodesic distance ( see ) . with this choice ,",
    "one obtains an extremum principle based on . varying this with respect to all null vectors @xmath84 and demanding the equation to hold for all @xmath84 at an event leads to einstein s equation with an undetermined cosmological constant . *",
    "when equations of motion hold , we can assign @xmath265 degrees of freedom with every area element @xmath266 in spacetime .",
    "this , in turn , allows us to fix the value of the undetermined  correctly and _ provides a solution to the cosmological constant problem_.",
    "the approach outlined here is based on the idea that gravity is the thermodynamic limit of the statistical mechanics of certain microscopic degrees of freedom ( ` atoms of space ' ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", deriving the field equations of classical gravity is algebraically straightforward  one might even say trivial , but let us not shun simplicity !",
    "it is obtained from an extremum principle based on the functional : @xmath295 varying @xmath84 in @xmath296 with the constraint that @xmath214 , and demanding that the result holds for all @xmath84 will lead to einstein s equation with an arbitrary cosmological constant .",
    "the approach works for a wild class of gravitational theories including the  models .    as far as classical gravity goes , that is the end of the story .",
    "but we could enquire about the physical meaning of this extremum principle .",
    "the combination @xmath297 is invariant under the shift @xmath298 ( constant )  which was the original reason to put it in the variational principle .",
    "postulating that the extremum principle must be invariant under the transformation @xmath0(constant ) naturally _ leads to _ the introduction of @xmath94 in the variational principle and to the local rindler observers for its interpretation . as i mentioned earlier ,",
    "this by itself is a valuable insight and shows the connection between two features  viz .",
    "the immunity of gravity to shifts in the cosmological constant , and the thermodynamic interpretation of gravity  which were considered as quite distinct .",
    "further , @xmath94 _ does _ have the interpretation as the heat density of matter on any null surface .",
    "it is also possible to interpret @xmath299 as the heating rate ( `` dissipation without dissipation '' ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : dwd ] ) of the null surface @xcite , thereby providing a purely thermodynamic underpinning for classical gravity .",
    "none of this poses any conceptual or technical problem .",
    "the real issues arise when we try to go beyond the classical theory and provide a semi - classical or quantum gravitational interpretation of this result .",
    "the description in terms of the expression in is approximate and only valid when @xmath300 .",
    "the entire description , based on the q - metric acting as a proxy for the effective spacetime metric , can not be trusted too close to planck scales .",
    "we expect it to capture the quantum gravitational effects to a certain extent , but at present we have no way of quantifying the accuracy of this approach .",
    "( it should also be noted that the identification @xmath301 might have further corrections close to planck scales . )",
    "we also do not know how to deal with matter fields in a quantum spacetime and it is not clear how to introduce @xmath43 in a systematic way . in fact , the _ only _ reason to vary the metric tensor in an extremum principle  a procedure which i have argued against  is to obtain @xmath43 classically and @xmath302 semi - classically .",
    "none of the thermodynamic derivations , which leads to the exact ( rather than linearized ) field equations , obtains @xmath43 ( or @xmath302 ) from fundamental considerations based on a matter action .",
    "it is ironic that the problem arises from the matter sector rather than from the gravity sector !",
    "the ideas outlined in this work suggest a more radical solution . matter , as we understand it , is quantum mechanical ; which essentially means that it is made of _ discrete _ degrees of freedom .",
    "how does such a _ discrete _ structure end up curving the _ continuum _ geometry ? that is , what is the actual _ mechanism _ by which @xmath43 produces @xmath303 ?",
    "the approach developed here suggests that one needs to introduce certain `` hidden variables '' , viz .",
    ", the auxiliary vector field @xmath193 , which encodes the discrete nature of geometry , and couple it to @xmath43 ( which is also fundamentally discrete in nature ) .",
    "the continuum geometry has to be related to @xmath193 , at scales much larger than the planck scale , by a suitable approximation just as the continuum density or pressure of a fluid arises when we average over the discreteness of the molecules .",
    "i have outlined one possible way in which this idea could be implemented , but it is by no means unique .",
    "further exploration of this approach could lead to a better understanding of how matter _ really _ ends up curving the spacetime .",
