    "solar flares first revealed themselves as visual perturbations of the solar atmosphere ( `` white light flares '' ) and hence immediately were construed as a photospheric process . with the invention of spectroscopic techniques ,",
    "though , it became clear that chromospheric emission lines such as h@xmath0 revealed flare presence much more readily .",
    "this led to the concept of the `` chromospheric flare '' and to a great deal of observational material on h@xmath0 flares and eruptions , as reviewed by @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , for example . at some point ,",
    "prior to the discovery of coronal flare effects , the misinterpretations of the h@xmath0 line profile even led to the incorrect idea that a flare was a sudden _ cooling _ of the solar atmosphere . in any case",
    ", a perturbation of the lower solar atmosphere violent enough to affect the solar luminosity itself (  white light \" ) implies a large energy content .",
    "our view of flares now emphasizes the high temperatures and non - thermal effects seen in the corona , and we generally believe the chromospheric effects themselves to be secondary in nature .",
    "this may be true , but nonetheless the modern observations confirm the fact that the lower solar atmosphere dominates the radiant energy budget of a flare via the uv and white - light continua .",
    "somehow , therefore , the energy stored in the solar corona rapidly focuses down into regions visible in chromospheric signatures ; this accounts for the high contrast of flare effects there .",
    "thus the `` chromospheric flare '' remains essential to our understanding of the overall processes involved .",
    "the chromosphere nowhere exists as a well - defined layer with a reproducible height structure . in this paper",
    "i use the term interchangeably with `` lower solar atmosphere , '' embracing the phenomena of the visible photosphere through the transition region . during flares",
    "the structure of these `` layers '' and the physical conditions within them may change drastically .",
    "the changes generally happen so fast and on such small spatial scales that we can not observe them comprehensively .",
    "understanding the impulsive phase in the chromosphere may therefore seem like something of a lost cause from the the point of view of theory , especially in view of our inability to understand the _ quiet _ chromosphere any better than we do .",
    "the data repeatedly reveal that we simply have not yet resolved the spatial or temporal structures involved in the impulsive phase , and that without knowing the geometry of the physical structure , we can not really comprehend its physics .",
    "the trace ( @xcite ) and rhessi ( @xcite ) observations have provided more than one recent breakthrough , however , and it may be that we are beginning to understand the _ gradual _ phase of a flare at least .",
    "this review is organized around several topics involving the behavior of the chromosphere during a flare .",
    "these include the process of `` chromospheric evaporation '' ( section  [ hudson - sec : evaporation ] ) , flare energetics ( section  [ hudson - sect : ergs ] ) , the mechanisms of flare continuum emission ( section  [ hudson - sec : cont ] ) , and the inference of flare structure from the morphology of the chromospheric flare ( section  [ hudson - sec : struct ] and section  [ hudson - sec : surge ] ) . in section",
    "[ hudson - sec : hist ] and section  [ hudson - sec : spectrum ] we give an overview of the history of chromospheric flares and show a cartoon to establish a working model of a solar flare . sections  [ hudson - sec : recon ] and  [ hudson - sec : model ] discuss large - scale magnetic reconnection and theoretical ideas , and section  [ hudson - sec : gamma ] presents a @xmath1-ray mystery .",
    "although it was the white - light continuum that initially revealed the existence of solar flares , the advent of spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) allowed their regular observation via the h@xmath0 line ( see @xcite for a discussion of the historical development of these observations ) .",
    "this strong absorption line actually becomes an emission line during bright flares , and h@xmath0 limb observations frequently show prominences and eruptions .",
    "h@xmath0 observers came to recognize a particular flare morphology , the so - called two - ribbon flare .",
    "@xcite described the patterns followed by these events , which provided strong evidence that the solar corona had to play a major role in flare development .",
    "figure  [ hudson - fig : bruzek ] reproduces one of bruzek s sketches , and then illustrates in a cartoon ( due to @xcite ) how this morphology led to our standard magnetic - reconnection scenario that tries to embrace the x - ray observations and the coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) as well as the chromospheric ribbon structures .",
    "`` loop prominence system '' over the limb .",
    "this key observational pattern led directly to the formation of our standard flare model ( right ) , in the form presented by anzer & pneuman ( 1982 ) .",

    "this key observational pattern led directly to the formation of our standard flare model ( right ) , in the form presented by anzer & pneuman ( 1982 ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in this standard picture a solar flare develops in a complicated manner that involves restructuring of the coronal magnetic field in such a way as to release energy .",
    "the immediate effects of this energy release are to produce broad - band `` impulsive phase '' emissions and to drive chromospheric gas up into coronal magnetic loops , the process we term `` chromospheric evaporation . '' a part of the field magnetic structure may actually erupt and open out into the solar wind , in the sense that the field lines stretch out past the alfv n critical point of the flow .",
    "this opening may consist of rising loops which then take the form of a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) , or it may involve interactions with previously open field ( a process often termed `` interchange reconnection '' nowadays ; see @xcite ) .",
    "if a cme does accompany the flare , as it almost invariably does for flares of goes class  x or greater , the energy involved in mass motions may be comparable to the luminous energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "generally the observations are limited in resolution , both temporal and spatial , and especially in spectral coverage .",
    "thus we often resort to a cartoon that serves to identify how the essential parts of a flare relate to one another .",
    "soft x - ray observations show hot loops in the gradual phase of a flare .",
    "these result from the material `` evaporated '' from the chromosphere and have anomalously high gas pressure ( but still low plasma @xmath2 ; however see @xcite ) . whereas the pressure at the base of the corona normally is of order 0.1  dyne  @xmath3",
    ", a bright flare loop can achieve 10@xmath4  dyne  @xmath3 .",
    "this over - dense and over - hot coronal loop gradually cools , and in its final stages the remaining plasma returns to a more chromospheric state and suddenly becomes visible in h@xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the loops that have reached this state then form bruzek s h@xmath0 loop prominence system ( figure  [ hudson - fig : bruzek ] ) .    during the ribbon expansion",
    "another important phenomenon occurs : hard x - ray emission appears at the footpoints of the coronal loops that are in the process of being filled by chromospheric evaporation @xcite .",
    "the hard x - rays show that a substantial part of flare energy appears in the form of non - thermal electrons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the hard x - ray signature ( and hence the energetic dominance of these electrons ) is present whether or not the flare develops the two - ribbon morphology or has a cme association .",
    "the hard x - ray emission occurs in the impulsive phase of the flare , contemporaneously with the period of chromospheric evaporation that fills the coronal loops and with the acceleration phase of the associated cme ( @xcite ) . in section  [ hudson - sect : ergs ]",
    "we describe this phase of the flare with the thick - target model ( @xcite ) which @xcite identified with the energy source of white - light flare continuum .",
    "a ( major ) flare can be observed at almost any wavelength in a fast - rise / slow - decay time profile , with some ( e.g. , the white - light continuum ) having a more impulsive variability , and others ( e.g. , the balmer lines ) having a more gradual pattern ( figure  [ hudson - fig : suemoto ] , right ) .",
    "we generally describe a flare as consisting of a footpoint and ribbon structures in the lower atmosphere , coronal loops , and various kinds of ejecta . the impulsive phase is typically associated with the footpoint structures , and the gradual phase with the flare ribbons . nowadays imaging spectroscopy in principle allows us to study these regions independently .     and 13.3 ; the inferred filling factor is small , suggesting either filamentary structure or thin layering .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    flare spectroscopy began with the observation of the balmer series , which shows broad lines tending towards emission profiles as the flare gets more energetic .",
    "early observations of the higher members of the sequence allowed the inference of a relatively high density and of a small filling factor ( @xcite ; see the left panel of figure  [ hudson - fig : suemoto ] ) .",
    "such observations refer to what we would now call the _ gradual phase _ of the flare ( see the right panel of figure  [ hudson - fig : suemoto ] for a sketch of the temporal development of a flare ) . in the _ impulsive phase _ the continuum appears in emission , as noted originally by carrington and by hodgson independently .",
    "the weak photospheric metallic lines may also go weakly into emission ( or are filled in by continuum ) and the recent observations of @xcite show that flare effects can appear even at the `` opacity minimum '' region of the spectrum , where one would expect much higher densities .",
    "in fact a single density could never properly describe such a heterogeneous structure , but each spectral band provides its own clues . at the time of writing no proper analysis of spectroscopic `` response functions '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) for any of the signatures has yet been attempted , so our inference of flare structure from the spectroscopy alone is weak .    the continuum radiation seen in white light and the uv constitutes the bulk of flare radiated energy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "trace imaging of this emission component shows it to consist of unresolved , intensely bright fine structures ( @xcite ) .",
    "the thick - target model invokes fast electrons ( energies above about 10  kev ) to transport coronal energy into the chromosphere . here",
    "collisional losses provide the heating and footpoint emissions that accompany the hard x - ray bremsstrahlung .",
    "the thick - target model does not explain the particle acceleration , nor show how the footpoint sources can be so intermittent .",
    "we return to this question in section  [ hudson - sec : struct ] .",
    "the spectra emitted at the footpoints of the flaring coronal loops have contributions over an exceptionally broad wavelength range , as sketched in the right panel of figure  [ hudson - fig : suemoto ] .",
    "the prototypical observable is the hard x - ray flux , which imaging observations show to be concentrated at the footpoints ( @xcite ) , but impulsive footpoint emissions also occur in many spectral windows ranging from the microwaves ( limited presumably by opacity ) to the @xmath1-rays ( limited presumably by detection sensitivity ) .",
    "there is a large body of work on the h@xmath0 line alone , both observation and theory .",
    "berlicki ( 2007 ) reviews the h@xmath0 spectroscopic material in detail in these proceedings .",
    "a strong absorption line forms across a wide range of continuum optical depths , and in principle this single line might provide sufficient information to infer the physical structure of the flare everywhere . in practice the complexities of the radiative transfer and of the flare motions , especially in the impulsive phase , make this information ambiguous ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the motions most directly relevant to the chromosphere are often called `` chromospheric evaporation , '' even though the direct doppler signatures of this motion are normally found in lines formed at higher temperatures ( but see ) . that this process occurs ( even if it is not `` evaporation '' strictly speaking ) was suggested by the early observations of loop prominence systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) with their `` coronal rain , '' and @xcite established its association with non - thermal processes such as bursts of microwave synchrotron radiation .",
    "the thermal microwave spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) made it particularly clear that the gradual phase of a solar flare involves the temporary levitation of chromospheric material into the corona , as opposed to the process that might be imagined from the earlier term `` sporadic coronal condensation '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the flows involved in chromospheric evaporation are along the field direction and serve to create systems of coronal loops with relatively high gas pressure and therefore higher ( but still probably low ) plasma beta .",
    "the early observational indications of chromospheric evaporation actually came from blueshifts in euv and soft x - ray lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) such as those from fexxv or caxix .",
    "figure  [ hudson - fig : czaykowska ] shows an image - resolved view of doppler shifts in an evaporative flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "the chromospheric effects are more subtle and in fact the impulsive - phase evaporation is difficult to disentangle from other effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high - temperature blueshifts correspond to upward velocities of some hundreds km / s and seldom appear in the absence of a stationary emission line ; in other words , hot plasma has already accumulated in coronal loops as the process continues .",
    "based on theory and simulations ( @xcite ) one can distinguish `` explosive '' and `` gentle '' evaporation , depending upon the physics of energy deposition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in explosive evaporation , driven hypothetically by an electron beam ,",
    "one has the additional complication of a `` chromospheric condensation '' that produces a redshift as well .",
    "@xcite and survey our overall understanding .",
    "it would be fair to comment that the explosive evaporation stage remains ill - understood , even though it principle it describes the key physics of sudden mass injections into flare loops .",
    "[ hudson - sect : ergs ]    we can use the standard val - c model @xcite , as discussed further in the appendix , to discuss the energetics . first we establish that the chromosphere and the rest of the lower solar atmosphere ( i.e. , that for which @xmath5 ) have negligible heat capacity and limited time scales .",
    "figure  [ hudson - fig : radtime ] shows an estimate of the radiative time scale in the val - c model ( @xcite ) .",
    "this shows 3@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the surface density as a function of height about the @xmath8  =  1 layer , and @xmath9 the solar luminosity .",
    "the time scale decreases below 1  sec only above z  @xmath10  515  km , near the temperature minimum in the val - c model . above this height",
    "any energy injected into the system will tend to radiate rapidly , resulting in a direct energy balance between input and output energy , rather than a local storage and release . at lower altitudes",
    "we would not expect to see rapid variability .",
    "the model also allows us to ask whether the chromosphere itself can store energy comparable to that released in a major flare or cme .",
    "table  [ hudson - tab : chrom ] gives some order - of - magnitude properties for a chromospheric area of 10@xmath11  @xmath12 , showing both possible sources ( bold ) and sinks ( italics ) of energy .",
    "for the magnetic field we simply assume 10  or 1000  g as representative cases . using the total magnetic energy in this manner",
    "is an upper limit , since the actual free energy would depend on its degree of non - potentiality .",
    "we find that magnetic energy storage limited to the volume of the chromosphere will not suffice , unless unobservably small - scale fields there somehow dominate",
    ". the gravitational potential energy also will not suffice .",
    "estimates of this sort confirm the idea that the flare energy must reside in the corona prior to the event .",
    "the estimate of gravitational potential energy is somewhat more ambiguous .",
    "the table shows the value needed to displace the entire atmosphere by its total thickness , the equivalent of roughly 3@xmath13 in the val - c model .",
    "there does not seem to be any evidence for such a displacement , although i am not aware of any searches .",
    "it is likely that the stresses that store energy in the coronal field have their origin deeper in the convection zone , rather than in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "actually the observable changes of gravitational energy are even of the wrong sign , given that we normally observe only outward motions , ( against gravity ) during a flare .",

    "this just restates the conventional wisdom , namely that the flare energy needs to be stored magnetically in the corona , rather than in the chromosphere where the radiation forms .",
    "note that this is backwards from the relationship for steady emissions : the requirement for chromospheric heating is _ larger _ than that for coronal heating , so it is possible to argue that the steady - state corona actually forms as a result of energy leakage from the process of chromospheric heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can make a similar estimate for energy flowing up from the photosphere . the alfvn speed at @xmath8  =  1 ranges from 3  to  30 km  s@xmath25 , depending on the field strength , in the val - c model ( see appendix ) . below the surface of the sun",
    "@xmath26 drops rapidly because of the increase of hydrogen ionization .",
    "thus chromospheric flare energy can not have been stored just below the photosphere , since it could not propagate upwards rapidly enough @xcite .",
    "this again supports the conventional wisdom that flare energy resides in the corona prior to the event .    to drive chromospheric radiations from coronal energy sources",
    "requires efficient energy transport , which is normally thought to be in the form of non - thermal particles ( the  thick target model  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or in the form of thermal conduction as in the formation of the classical transition region .",
    "both of these mechanisms provide interesting physical problems , but the impulsive phase of the flare ( where the thick - target model usually is thought to apply ) certainly remains less understood . section  [ hudson - sec : model ] comments on models .",
    "the magnetic field in the chromosphere is decisively important but ill - understood .",
    "the plasma beta is generally low ( see appendix ) , so just as in the corona the dynamics depends more on the behavior of the field itself than to the other forces at work .",
    "generally we believe that the subphotospheric field exists in fibrils , implying the existence of sheath currents that isolate the flux tubes from their unmagnetized environment . on the other hand",
    ", the dominance of plasma pressure in the chromosphere as well as the corona implies that the field must rapidly expand to become space - filling .",
    "@xcite discuss the physics involved in this process as flux emerges from the interior .",
    "the effect of the flux emergence must be to create current systems linking the sources of magnetic stress below the photosphere , with the non - potential fields containing the coronal free energy .",
    "a full theory of how this works does not exist , and we must add to the uncertainty the possibilty of unresolved fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their suggested factor of 100 in * b*@xmath27 would clearly affect the estimate of magnetic energy given in table  [ hudson - tab : chrom ] and perhaps change everything .",
    "we note in this context that the  impulse response \" flares @xcite have scales so small that one could argue for an entirely chromospheric origin .",
    "the formation of the optical / uv emission spectrum of a solar flare has from the outset presented a special challenge , since ( a ) it represents so much energy , and ( b ) it appears in what should be the stablest layer of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the recent observations of rapid variability and spatial intermittency make this all the more interesting , and these observations  now from space  also help to intercompare events ; previous catalogs of white - light flares ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) had to be based on spotty observations made with a wide variety of instruments .",
    "observationally , the continuum appears to have two classes , with most events ( `` type i '' spectra ) showing evidence for recombination radiation via the presence of the balmer edge and sometimes the paschen edge as well .",
    "a few events ( e.g. , @xcite ) show spectra with weak or unobservable balmer jumps , implicating h@xmath28 continuum as observed in normal photospheric radiation .",
    "the spectra in the latter class ( `` type ii '' ) suggests a relationship to ellerman bombs ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the physics of ellerman bombs appears to be quite different from that of solar flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though .",
    "the strong suggestion from correlations is that non - thermal electrons physically transport flare energy from the corona , where it had been stored in the current systems of non - potential field structures , into the radiating layers .",
    "the hard x - ray bremsstrahlung results from the collisional energy losses of these particles , and other signatures ( such as the optical / uv continuum ) depends on secondary effects .",
    "proposed mechanisms include direct heating , heating in the presence of non - thermal ionization , and radiative backwarming . in some manner these effects ( or others not imagined ) must provide the emissivity @xmath29 , to support the observed spectrum .",
    "note that the emissivity is often expressed in terms of the source function @xmath30  =  @xmath31 via the opacity @xmath32 . in a steady state one would have energy balance between the input ( e.g. , electrons ) and the continuum .",
    "fletcher et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have now shown that this implies energy transport by low - energy electrons , below 25  kev , as opposed to the 50  kev or higher suggested by some earlier authors .",
    "such low - energy electrons have little penetrating power and could not directly heat the photosphere itself from a coronal acceleration site .",
    "thus either the continuum arises from altered conditions in the chromosphere , or some mechanism must be devised to link the chromosphere and photosphere not involving the thick - target electrons .",
    "`` radiative backwarming ''  for example balmer and paschen continuum excited in the chromosphere and then penetrating down to and heating a deeper layer  could in principle provide a vertical step between energy source and sink .",
    "one problem with this is that the weaker backwarming energy fluxes might not cause appreciable heating in the denser atmosphere , and thus not be able to contribute to the observed continuum excess , because of the short radiative time scale .",
    "this idea is a variant of the mechanism of non - thermal ionization originally proposed by @xcite in the `` specific ionization approximation , '' which involves no radiative - transfer theory and simply assumes ion - electron pairs to be created locally at a mean energy ( @xmath1030  ev per ion pair ) .",
    "finally , the rapid variability observed in the continuuum , even at 1.56  @xmath33 m @xcite provides a clear argument that the continuum forms at the temperature minimum or above ( see section  [ hudson - sec : ergs ] , especially figure  [ hudson - fig : radtime ] ) .",
    "early proponents of particle heating as an explanation for white - light flares also considered protons as an energy source ( @xcite ) .",
    "this made sense , because protons at energies even below those characteristic of @xmath1-ray emission - line excitation can penetrate more deeply than the electrons that produce hard x  rays .",
    "it makes even more sense now that we have the suggestion that ion acceleration in solar flares may rival electron acceleration energetically ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that particle acceleration in solar flares involves a neutral beam , implying that the major energy content ( and hence the optical / uv continuum ) would originate in the ion component . this idea does not appear to explain the apparent simultaneity of the footpoint sources ( @xcite ) , and at present we do not understand the plasma physics of the particle acceleration and propagation well enough even to identify the location of the acceleration region .",
    "the continuum kernels may move systematically for perhaps tens of seconds and generally have short lifetimes .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ hudson - fig : pollock ] ( from @xcite ) .",
    "this shows the motions of individual uv  bright points within the flare ribbon structure .",
    "such motions are only apparent motions , as in a deflagration wave , because they exceed the estimated photospheric alfv ' en speed ( see section  [ hudson - sec : evaporation ] and the appendix ) . figure  [ hudson - fig:4panel ] ( from @xcite ) makes the same point for a different flare , using trace white - light observations .",
    "the basic picture one gets from such observations is that the white light / uv continuum of a flare appears in compact structures that are essentially unresolved in space and in time within the present observational limits .",
    "these bright points contain enormous energy and thus must map directly to the energy source .",
    "we do not know if the fragmentation ( intermittency ) results from this mapping or is intrinsic to the basic energy - release mechanism .",
    "note the presence of bright features consistent with the trace angular resolution , and which change from frame to frame over the 30-second interval .",
    "these observations do not appear to resolve the fluctuations either in space or in time @xcite . ]",
    "how do the small chromospheric sources map into the corona , where the flare energy must reside on a large scale before its release ?",
    "a strong literature has grown up regarding this point , interpreting the ribbon motions as measures of flux transfer in the standard magnetic - reconnection model ( @xcite ; see also literature cited , for example , by @xcite ) .",
    "the flux transfer in the photosphere is taken to measure the coronal inflow into the reconnecting current sheet , which appears to correlate with the radiated energy as seen in hard x - rays , uv , or h@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ hudson - fig : bruzek ] ( right ) shows the assumed geometry linking the chromosphere and corona .",
    "the analysis extends to the multiple simultaneous uv footpoints apparently moving within the ribbons as they evolve , as noted in figure  [ hudson - fig : pollock ] above .",
    "the analyses suggest a strong relationship between energy release and the inferred coronal alfv ' en speed .",
    "to release energy from coronal magnetic field in a largely `` frozen - field '' plasma , a flare must involve mass motions .",
    "we often do observe apparent motions , both parallel and perpendicular to the field as indicated by the image striations ( `` loops '' ) .",
    "most of the observable motions are outward , leading to the idea of a `` magnetic explosion '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "motions apparently perpendicular to the magnetic field may become coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) and contain a great deal of energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these perpendicular motions also are involved in flare energy release ; for example the large - scale magnetic reconnection involved in many flare models ( figure  [ hudson - fig : bruzek ] , right panel ) necessarily involve `` shrinkage '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that this process is more of a magnetic implosion than a magnetic explosion @xcite .",
    "the motion of flare footpoints and ribbons is ( we believe ) only apparent , because of the low alfv ' en speed @xmath26 in the photosphere , where the field is temporarily anchored ( `` line - tied '' ) . for @xmath34",
    "= 1000  g and @xmath35  =  10@xmath16  @xmath36 we find @xmath37  6  km  s@xmath25 ; observations often suggest motions an order of magnitude faster ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "the motions therefore represent a wave - light conflagration moving through a relatively fixed magnetic - field structure .",
    "it is natural to imagine that this sequence of field lines links to the coronal energy - release site , which the standard model identifies with a current sheet that mediates large - scale magnetic reconnection .",
    "figure  [ hudson - fig : saba ] shows one example of the result of an analysis of the apparent motion of a flare ribbon @xcite .",
    "this and other similar analyses reveal a tendency for the `` reconnection rate '' to correlate with the pixel brightness .",
    "the reconnection rate is the rate at which flux is swept out in the ribbon motion , often expressed as an electric field from * e *  =  * v*@xmath15*b * ( the so - called `` reconnection electric field '' ) . in this picture",
    "the flare ribbons are identified with `` quasi - separatrix structures '' where magnetic reconnection can take place most directly .",
    "chromospheric material also appears in the corona in the form of surges and sprays , which may have a close relationship to the flare process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , of course , we observe filaments and prominences in chromospheric lines , and these also have a flare / cme association , but too tangential for discussion in this review .    surges and sprays are h@xmath0 ejecta , rising into the corona as a result of chromospheric magnetic activity .",
    "the literature traditionally distinguishes them by apparent velocity , with the faster - moving sprays taken to have stronger flare associations .",
    "surges often appear to return to the sun , while sprays accelerate beyond the escape velocity and do not return .",
    "both appear to move along the magnetic field lines , but unlike the evaporation flow the surges and sprays incorporate material at chromospheric temperatures .",
    "modern soft x - ray and euv data ( _ yohkoh _ , soho , and trace ) have had sufficient time resolution to reveal the phenomenon of x - ray jets @xcite ; see also the uv observations of @xcite .",
    "these tightly - collimated structures at x - ray temperatures have a strong correlation with surges and sprays , and indeed presumably lead to the jet - like cmes seen at much greater altitudes @xcite .",
    "these events have a strong association with emerging flux , and indeed the x - ray jets invariably have an association with microflares and originate in the chromosphere near the microflare loop(s ) @xcite .",
    "as zirin famously remarked , most emerging flux emerges within active regions , and that is where the jets preferentially occur .",
    "the site is frequently in the leading part of the sunspot group .",
    "figure  [ hudson - fig : canfield ] @xcite shows the sequence of events in an explanation of these phenomena invoking magnetic reconnection to allow chromospheric material access to open fields .",
    "note that this scenario imposes two requirements on the chromosphere : there must be open and closed fields juxtaposed , and a large - scale reconnection process must be able to proceed under chromospheric conditions .",
    "the @xcite observations strongly imply that this process requires the presence of vertical electric currents supporting the observed twisting motions .        the surges , sprays , and jets , not to mention flares and cmes , underscore the time dependence and three - dimensionality characterizing what is often characterized as a thin time - independent layer for convenience .",
    "the subject of spicules is outside the scope of this review , but we note that they represent a form of activity that occurs ubiquitously outside the magnetic active regions .",
    "the @xmath1-ray observations of solar flares have begun , as did the radio and x - ray observations before them , to open new windows on flare physics .",
    "@xcite have made a discovery that is difficult to understand and which involves chromospheric material .",
    "they report observations of the line width of the 0.511  mev @xmath1-ray emission line formed by positron annihilation ( figure  [ hudson - fig : share ] ) .",
    "this emission requires a complicated chain of events : the acceleration of high - energy ions , their collisional braking and nuclear interactions in the solar atmosphere , the emission of secondary positrons by the excited nuclei , the collisional braking of these energetic positrons in turn , and finally their recombination with ambient electrons to produce the 0.511  mev @xmath1-rays .",
    "because the @xmath1-ray observations are so insensitive , this process requires an energetically significant level of particle acceleration that is possibly distinct from the well - known electron acceleration in the impulsive phase .",
    "-ray observations of the 0.511  mev line of positron annihilation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two line profiles are from different integrations in the late phase of the x17  flare of 28  october 2003 ; for the broader line the authors suggest thermal broadening , which would require a large column depth of transition - region temperatures during the flare . ]",
    "the mystery comes in the line width of the emission line .",
    "surprisingly the pioneering rhessi observations of @xcite showed it to be broad enough to resolve .",
    "the likeliest source of this line broadening is doppler motions in the positron - annihilation region .",
    "this requires the existence of a large column density ( of order gram  @xmath3 ) at transition - region temperatures ; the transition region under hydrostatic conditions would be many orders of magnitude thinner ( see also figure  [ hudson - fig : ztausigma ] ) . according to @xcite , the excitation of the footpoint regions during the the time of intense particle acceleration only continues for some tens of seconds at most .",
    "this would represent the time scale for the apparent motion of a foopoint source across its diameter .",
    "the @xmath1-ray observations , on the other hand , require minutes of integration for a statistically significant line - profile measurement .",
    "we therefore are confronted with a major problem .",
    "what is the structure of the flaring atmosphere that permits the formation of the broad 0.511  mev @xmath1-ray line ?",
    "recent spectroscopic observations of the impulsive phase in the  uv , as viewed off the limb @xcite make a conventional explanation difficult .",
    "to understand the chromospheric spectrum of a solar flare we must understand the formation of the radiation and its transfer in the context of the motions produced by ( or producing ) the flare .",
    "the representation of the spectrum by a `` semi - empirical model '' represents one shortcut ; in such an approach ( e.g. , the standard val model that we use in the appendix ) one attempts to construct a model atmosphere capable of describing the spectrum even if it may not be physically self - consistent .",
    "such descriptions may however be sufficient in the gradual phase of a flare when the flare loops no longer have energy input and simply evolve by cooling and draining . even here , however , we do not have a good understanding of the `` moss '' regions that form at the footpoints of these high - pressure loops ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "so far as i am aware there is no literature specifically on `` spreading moss , '' the similar structure that appears in association with flare ribbons .    a more complete approach to the physics comes from `` radiation hydrodynamics '' physical models , most recently those of @xcite ;",
    "see @xcite for a fuller description .",
    "such models solve the equations of hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simultaneously and can thus deal with chromospheric evaporation and the formation of the high - pressure flare loops .",
    "this framework is necessary if we are to be able to understand the flare impulsive phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even these models do not have sufficient realism , though , since they work currently in one dimension and thus can not follow the time development of the excitation properly ; the high - resolution observations of uv and white light by trace clearly show that the energy release has unresolved scales .",
    "further , as pointed out by @xcite , the ionization of the chromosphere ( and hence the formation of the continua ) can not be described by a fluid approximation , or even by non - lte radiative transfer that assumes a unique temperature .",
    "m , the `` opacity minimum '' region ) during an x10 flare ( @xcite ) .",
    "red shows the ir emissions , contours show the rhessi 50 - 100  kev x - ray sources .",
    "the ir contrast relative to the preflare photosphere reached @xmath1020% in this event . ]    at present there has been little effort to create an electrodynamic theory of chromospheric flare processes , even though non - thermal particles are widely thought to provide the dominant energy in at least the impulsive phase . in the gradual phase",
    "there is interesting physics associated with heat conduction because the transition region would have to become so steep that classical conductivity estimates have difficulty ( @xcite ) .",
    "a more complete theory would have to take plasma effects into account and would probably contain elements of theories of the terrestrial aurora that are now largely missing from the solar lexicon .",
    "this lack of self - consistency in the modeling probably means that we have major gaps in our understanding of , for example , the evaporation process as it affects the fractionation of the elements and of the ionization states of the flare plasma .",
    "the appendix gives estimates of the ranges of some the key plasma parameters in the chromosphere .",
    "this article has reviewed chromospheric flare observations from the point of view of the newest available information  _ yohkoh _ , soho , trace and rhessi , for example , but not _ hinode _ or stereo ( already launched ) , nor much less fasr or atst ( not launched yet at the time of writing ) .",
    "spite of the high quality of the data prior to these missions , we still find major unsolved problems :            in my view the solution of these problems can not be found in chromospheric observations alone , because the physical processes involve much broader regions of the solar atmosphere . even providing answers to these specific questions may not reveal the plasma physics responsible for flare occurrence , which may involve spatial scales too fine ever to resolve .",
    "but we can hope that new observations from space and from the ground , in wavelengths ranging from the radio to the @xmath1-rays , will enable us to continue our current rapid progress , and can speculate that eventually numerical tools will supplement the theory well enough for us to achieve full comprehension of the important properties of flares . to get to this point we will need to deal with the chromosphere , as messy as it is .",
    "one important task that is probably within our grasp now is the computation of response functions for physical models of flares . at present",
    "these are restricted to very limited numerical explorations of the radiative transfer within the framework of one - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy transport in these models has been restricted to simplistic representations of particle beams for energy transport , and do not take account of complicated flare geometries , waves , or various elements of plasma physics .",
    "future developments of chromospheric flare theory will need to complete the picture in a more self - consistent manner .",

    "* appendix : plasma parameters*[hudson - sec : appendix ]    the lower solar atmosphere marks the transition layer between regions of striking physical differences , and as one goes further up in height the tools of plasma physics should become more important .",
    "this appendix evaluates for convenience several basic plasma - physics parameters for the conditions of the staple val - c atmospheric model @xcite .",
    "this is a `` semi - empirical model '' in which interprets a set of observations in terms of the theory of radiative transfer , but without any effort to have self - consistent physics .",
    "such a model can accurately represent the spectrum but may or may not provide a good starting point for physical analysis . because the optical depth of a spectral feature is the key parameter determining its structure , one often sees the model parameters plotted against continuum optical depth @xmath8 evaluated at 5000 . just for illustration ,",
    "figure  [ hudson - fig : ztausigma ] shows the val - c temperature separately as a function of height , column mass , and optical depth .",
    "note that features prominent in one display may appear to be negligible in another        the val - c model is an `` average quiet sun '' model , and like all static  1d models , it can not describe the variability of the physical parameters that theory and observation require ( see other papers in these proceedings , e.g. , carlsson s review ) .",
    "thus we should regard the plasma parameters estimated here as order - of - magnitude estimates only and note especially that the vertical scales , which depend in the model on the inferred optical - depth scale , may be systematically displaced .",
    "the val - c model explicitly does not represent a chromosphere perturbed by a flare .",
    "@xcite and many other authors give more appropriate models derived by similar techniques for flares as well as other structures . as the discussion of the @xmath1-ray signatures in section  [ hudson - sec : gamma ] suggests , though , a powerful flare may be able distort the lower solar atmosphere essentially beyond all recognition ( especially in the impulsive phase ) . to estimate representative plasma parameters",
    "i have therefore chosen just to start with the basic val - c model , and we simply assume constant values of @xmath34 at 10  g and 1000  g. the actual magnetic field may vary through this region ( the `` canopy '' ) but the details are little - understood .",
    "the @xmath1-ray literature usually uses a parametrization of the magnetic field strength @xmath39 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath40 is the gas pressure .",
    "the most complicated behavior of the plasma parameters happens preferentially near the top of the val - c model range ( for example , figure  [ hudson - fig : chr_par ] shows that the collision frequency decreases below the plasma and larmor frequencies ) above the helium ionization level ( or even below this level for strong magnetic fields ) .",
    "because val - c ignores time dependences and 3d structure , and assumes @xmath41 , we can expect that it has diminished fidelity as one approaches the unstable transition region ; thus one should be especially careful not to take these approximations too literally .",
    "the following notes correspond to each panel of the figure .",
    "most of the plasma - physics formulae used in this appendix are from @xcite .",

    "* ) .      * dimensionless parameters : * we approximate the plasma beta as @xmath44 with @xmath45 the hydrogen density , @xmath46 the electron density , figure  [ hudson - fig : chr_par](c ) gives the number of electrons in a debye sphere as the `` plasma parameter '' @xmath47 .",

    "note that the collision frequencies are small compared with the plasma and larmor frequencies above about 1000  km in this model .",
