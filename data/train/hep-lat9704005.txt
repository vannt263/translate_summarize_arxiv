    "lattice simulations are characterized by one dimensionless parameter , the number of degrees of freedom @xmath9 . for sufficiently large @xmath0",
    "one can neglect the effect of @xmath10 and integrate from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ( satisfied for sufficiently large @xmath12 ) , the result",
    "can be expanded into @xmath14    as is to be expected for a 1-dimensional system , the limit @xmath15 exists and is well - behaved ; there is no need for renormalization of ultra - violet divergences .",
    "however , the effective one - loop potential is lattice - spacing dependent through the explicit appearance of @xmath12 , and so are the corresponding numerical simulations . in order to remove this dependence on @xmath1",
    ", we follow the renormalization procedure given by bg @xcite ; it is irrelevant if the @xmath12-dependent terms are ultra - violet finite ( @xmath16 ) or infinite ( @xmath17 ) . in the lattice formulation of the theory",
    ", we add a ( finite ) counterterm to the tree - level potential @xmath18 to remove the lattice - spacing dependence of the results , @xmath19 there is an additional , @xmath12-independent , counterterm which was set to zero by an appropriate choice of renormalization scale .",
    "the lattice simulation then uses the corrected potential @xmath20 as we will show later in the context of kink - antikink pair production , this lattice formulation simulates the continuum limit to one loop as given by eq .",
    "( [ e.oneloopdef ] ) .",
    "note that the above treatment yields two novel results .",
    "first , that the use of @xmath21 instead of @xmath18 gets rid of the dependence of simulations on lattice spacing .",
    "[ of course , as @xmath22 , @xmath23 . however , this limit is often not computationally efficient . ]",
    "previous works @xcite , have explored the influence of a counterterm quadratic on lattice spacing .",
    "however , we note that for small enough @xmath1 , the limit of interest here , our linear correction is dominant .",
    "second , that the effective interactions that are simulated must be compared to the one - loop corrected potential @xmath24 of eq .",
    "( [ e.oneloopdef ] ) ; once the lattice formulation is made independent of lattice spacing by the addition of the proper counterterm(s ) , it simulates , within its domain of validity , the thermally corrected one - loop effective potential .",
    "as an application of the method discussed above we consider the symmetric double - well potential @xmath25 .",
    "the excitations of the associated quantum theory have a mass @xmath26 .",
    "thus , in order for the system to remain in the classical regime , the condition @xmath27 must hold .",
    "this constrains the dimensionless temperature @xmath28 to be larger than @xmath29 . for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the dimensionless kink mass corresponding to the tree - level potential @xmath18 @xcite",
    ", we can expect to have only a dilute gas of kink - antikinks at thermal equilibrium . with these two conditions",
    "jointly satisfied , the system will also obey @xmath32 , indicating weak coupling .",
    "the corrected lattice potential is @xmath33 simulations using @xmath21 will , in principle , match the continuum theory @xmath34 which has ( shifted ) minima at @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .    for the numerical simulations we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "to keep the notation simple we will subsequently suppress the tilde .",
    "the field is prepared as @xmath40 , and evolved in time according to a langevin equation with white noise that incorporates the environmental temperature @xmath3 through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the details of this and of the numerical implementation are laid out in @xcite .",
    "the viscosity coefficient @xmath41 has been set to unity throughout this study .",
    "the time step is @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the heat bath takes a time @xmath44 to achieve equipartition so that the energy per degree of freedom is @xmath45 .",
    "* ensemble average of field .",
    "* for sufficiently low temperatures the simulated field will remain in the vicinity of the minimum @xmath46 for a very long time ( compared to typical fluctuation time - scales ) , until large - amplitude fluctuations drive portions of the space over the barrier at @xmath47 and beyond .",
    "the subsequent evolution is then the formation of the first kink - antikink pair .",
    "true thermal equilibrium consists of reaching the final equilibrium kink - antikink density together with zero mean field . in a lose sense",
    ", this situation corresponds to symmetry restoration , although in one spatial dimension `` symmetry restoration '' will occur for any nonzero temperature ; it is all a matter of time .    as a first test of our procedure",
    ", we investigate the mean field value @xmath48 _ before _ the nucleation of a kink - antikink pair , _",
    "i.e. _ , while the field is still well localized in the bottom of the well . in fig .",
    "[ f.phiave ] we show the ensemble average of @xmath49 ( after 100 experiments ) for different values of @xmath1 , ranging from 1 down to 0.1 , at @xmath50 .",
    "the simulations leading to the left graphs use the `` bare '' potential @xmath18 , whereas the right graphs are produced employing @xmath21 ( eq .  [ e.vlatt ] ) . apart from a discrepancy for very coarse grids ( @xmath51 ) , where the resolution nears the correlation length , the average field value is clearly lattice - spacing independent when using @xmath21 , in contrast to the use of @xmath18 .    as discussed before",
    ", the average mean field value should correspond to the minimum @xmath52 of the effective potential .",
    "however , since we are only using a one - loop approximation , this agreement will get progressively worse as the temperature increases .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 , the discrepancy between the theoretical value , @xmath54 , and the numerical result is 10% . for higher temperatures",
    ", we should not trust the one - loop approximation ; other nonperturbative effects , such as subcritical fluctuations , too small in width and amplitude to emerge as a kink - antikink pair but still large enough to bring the average value of the field away from its one - loop value , will become important@xcite .",
    "thus , we restrict our investigation to temperatures safely within the limits of validity of the one - loop approximation . in a subsequent study , we intend to investigate the role of these nonperturbative effects .",
    "* density of kink - antikink pairs . * perhaps the most difficult task when counting the number of kink - antikink pairs that emerge during a simulation is the identification of what precisely is a kink - antikink pair at different temperatures .",
    "typically , we can identify three `` types '' of fluctuations : i ) small amplitude , perturbative fluctuations about one of the two minima of the potential ; ii ) full - blown kink - antikink pairs interpolating between the two minima of the potential ; iii ) nonperturbative fluctuations which have large amplitude but not quite large enough to satisfy the boundary conditions required for a kink - antikink pair .",
    "these latter fluctuations are usually dealt with by a smearing of the field over a certain length scale .",
    "basically , one chooses a given smearing length @xmath55 which will be large enough to `` iron out '' these `` undesirable '' fluctuations but not too large that actual kink - antikink pairs are also ironed - out . in this study",
    ", a similar smoothing was implemented as a four - pole butterworth low - pass filter of the field with a filter cutoff length @xmath55 .",
    "the filter removes fluctuations with wavelengths smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "the choice of @xmath55 is , in a sense , more an art than a science , given our ignorance of how to handle these nonperturbative fluctuations .    in table 1",
    "we show the number of pairs for different choices of filter cutoff length and for different temperatures .",
    "we counted pairs by identifying the zeros of the filtered field . from table 1",
    "it is clear that as the temperature increases , the discrepancies in the count of pairs also increase .",
    "for this reason we only trust our data for fairly low temperatures .",
    "the problem is agravated by the fact that the `` size '' of the kink - antikink pair , _",
    "i.e. _ , the minimal separation between the two , not only changes due to dynamical effects , but also changes with temperature .",
    "thus , choosing the filter cutoff length to be too large may actually undercount the number of pairs .",
    "choosing it too low may include nonpertubative fluctuations as pairs .",
    "we chose @xmath56 in the present work , as this is the smallest `` size '' for a kink - antikink pair .",
    "in contrast , in the works by alexander et al .",
    "a different method was adopted , that looked for zero - crossings for eight lattice units ( they used @xmath57 ) to the left and right of a zero crossing @xcite .",
    "we have checked that our simulations reproduce the results of alexander et al .",
    "if we : i ) use the bare potential in the lattice simulations and ii ) use a large filter cutoo length @xmath55 .",
    "specifically , the number of pairs found with the bare potential for @xmath58 are : @xmath59 , for @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "found ( for our lattice length ) @xmath61 . comparing these with table 1 ,",
    "it is clear that the differences between our results and those of alexander et al .",
    "come from using a different potential in the simulations , _ viz . _",
    "a corrected vs. an uncorrected potential .",
    "we believe that at this point it is fair to say that the `` smearing issue '' remains unresolved , at least for temperatures @xmath62 or so .",
    "we intend to address the issue of how to deal with these nonperturbative effects in a forthcoming publication . in any case , the focus of the present work is mostly on how to achieve a lattice - independent count , irrespective of the particular method used for identifying the kink - antikink pairs .",
    "[ f.kinkdens ] compares measurements of the kink - antikink pair density ( half the number of zeros of the filtered field ) , ensemble - averaged over 100 experiments , for different lattice spacings .",
    "again it is clear from the graphs on the left that using the tree - level potential @xmath18 in the simulations causes the results to be dependent on @xmath1 , whereas the addition of the finite counterterm removes this problem quite efficiently ; both diagrams of fig .",
    "[ f.kinkdens ] contain four graphs each , although the graphs on the right are almost indistinguishable .",
    "unless the properly corrected potential is used in the lattice simulations , the measured number density of topological defects is sensitive to the lattice spacing",
    ". one must be careful when counting kinks , especially for large lattice spacings , say @xmath63 or larger .",
    "the next step is to extract the correct continuum theory from the lattice simulations .",
    "what theory is the lattice simulating ?",
    "most previous simulations of thermal nucleation of kink - antikink pairs have overlooked this problem .",
    "although a temperature - dependent kink mass was conjectured in the works of reference @xcite , not much has been done to understand its origin or its value .",
    "one way of addressing it is by comparing the numerically measured kink mass with its theoretical prediction .",
    "it has been found that the measured mass was smaller than the theoretical prediction by a factor ranging from 25% to 45%@xcite , a disturbing result .",
    "this has been attributed to several effects , such as the finite size of the lattice , the finite size of the kinks , and phonon dressing effects due to the lattice discretization@xcite .",
    "we will show that this problem is rooted in the incorrect matching between theory and numerical simulations . in the works by alexander et al .",
    "a beautiful agreement between the low temperature limit and a @xmath64 wkb approximation was obtained , as well as between high temperatures and a double gaussian nonperturbative method @xcite .",
    "our method is effective precisely between these two regimes , and could be interpreted as a @xmath3-dependent wkb approximation obtained naturally from the inclusion of counterterms .",
    "one should expect the equilibrium kink - antikink pair density to follow the proportionality @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the kink mass , given by @xmath67 \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] and @xmath68 is the kink solution to the equation of motion .",
    "note that we left the potential @xmath69 unspecified .",
    "if we use the tree - level potential , @xmath70 , we obtain the well - known result @xmath71 . or , in dimensionless variables , @xmath72 .",
    "one can extract the numerical value of @xmath66 by measuring the pair density and plotting the results in a logarithmic scale , as in ref .",
    "the result should be a straight line with negative slope @xmath73 .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the measured slope was found to be about @xmath74 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is that the potential which should be used when comparing theory and simulation is not the tree - level potential @xmath75 but the effective potential @xmath24 .",
    "thus , one must compute the effective kink mass @xmath76 using the corrected potential @xmath24 and _ then _ compare the results with the numerical simulations .    the effective kink mass can be found using the equation of motion and the real part of @xmath77 @xcite , @xmath78   = 2\\int_0^{\\phi_{\\rm min } } \\sqrt{2 { \\rm re}(v_{\\rm 1l}(\\phi ) ) } \\ , d\\phi \\ ; .\\ ] ] this integration can easily be carried out numerically . in fig .",
    "[ f.kinktheory ] we plot the ratio @xmath79 vs.  the dimensionless temperature , @xmath80 .",
    "of course , for @xmath64 , @xmath81 . as the temperature increases , the effective kink mass decreases .",
    "the points represent the kink mass extracted from the numerical simulations , while the error bars were obtained by propagating the standard deviation of the ensemble average .",
    "it is quite clear that the effective kink mass tracks the numerical values quite well .",
    "in fact , within the validity of our approximations , the `` averaged '' value for the effective kink mass is @xmath82 . also , since the mass extracted from the simulations depends on the filter cutoff length @xmath55 , the reasonable agreement between theory and numerical experiment offers indirect support for our choice of @xmath56 .",
    "for very small and very large temperatures the theory fails to track the numerical data . at large temperatures @xmath83 ,",
    "the one - loop approximation breaks down , while for low temperatures @xmath84 , the large pair nucleation time - scale precludes a proper statistical analysis ( not enough experiments ) .",
    "however , the conclusion is quite clear : by controlling the dependence on lattice spacing of the simulations we were able , within the validity of our approximations , to obtain the correct effective potential that should be used when comparing theory and numerical experiment .",
