    "ultracold quantum gases play an important role in our understanding of phase transitions ; they provide us with a number of experimental controls and observational tools that are not available in conventional condensed matter systems .",
    "for example , modern experiments with laser - cooled atoms have demonstrated thermal phase transitions such as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite and the berezinkskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition in two - dimensional ( 2d ) superfluids  @xcite , and quantum phase transitions such as the mott insulator / superfluid transition @xcite and dicke super - radiant self - organization  @xcite .",
    "recently , a great deal of interest has been generated by quantum gases of bosons with spin or pseudo - spin degrees of freedom , including spinor  @xcite and spin - orbit coupled becs  @xcite , which are ideal for studying a variety of magnetic and topological phase transitions in quantum - degenerate matter .",
    "perhaps the most simple , yet robust quantum bose gas with a pseudo - spin ( 1/2 ) degree of freedom is the two - component , or binary bec . at ultracold temperatures ,",
    "this system supports a second - order phase transition between miscible and immiscible states as the interaction strength between the components ( @xmath3 ) is tuned across a critical threshold @xmath4 , reminiscent of a para - to - ferromagnetic ising transition . to date , a great deal of experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite work has been dedicated to understanding these states and the dynamics of the transition between them .",
    "binary condensates exhibit qualitatively different behavior , if the population of each component is required to be individually conserved , depending whether the system is trapped or homogenous ( infinite ) . for the trapped system , in the immiscible phase , the separated components meet at a well - defined interface where the components overlap ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : flucscaling ] insets ) .",
    "in contrast , the infinite homogenous system is somewhat pathological with the interface boundary being difficult to define .",
    "we consider the case where the population of each component is individually conserved , and focus on the experimentally realistic situation of an oblate trapping potential , much like a pancake .",
    "as we shall see , a further consideration for the trapped system is that large length - scale fluctuations are dominated by a finite number of excitations , in contrast to the continuum exhibited by the infinite system .",
    "a number of groups have performed theoretical studies of quenches across the miscible - immiscible transition for both simple @xcite and coherently coupled @xcite binary condensates , and have demonstrated , for example , a kibble - zurek scaling of domain formation  @xcite and long - time coarsening behavior of the `` ferromagnetic '' domains  @xcite .",
    "these studies were motived in part by the fact that ultracold atomic systems equilibrate on relatively long time scales , allowing for resolved measurements of their dynamics .",
    "modern methods for _ in situ _ imaging , however , allow for the direct measurement of number fluctuations , and thus for statistical studies of equilibrium states that were previously unobtainable @xcite .",
    "experimental _ in situ _ investigations of atom - number fluctuations have already probed quantum fluctuations in one dimension @xcite , the universality of the berezinkskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite and the hanbury brown - twiss effect @xcite in bose gases .",
    "furthermore , recent theoretical studies pave the way for experiments to utilize number fluctuations to investigate spinor condensates @xcite and roton excitations in dipolar condensates @xcite .    in this paper , we study the equilibrium properties of a binary condensate near the miscible - immiscible transition threshold at very low but finite temperature , and show how measurements of number fluctuations can reveal the scaling exponent associated with the diverging susceptibility to pseudo - spin , or magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we numerically calculate the magnetic fluctuations within finite observation cells .",
    "experimentally , the observation cells may be formed either by considering individual imaging pixels or by combining pixels to form larger cells , and fluctuation statistics can be obtained by repeated _ in situ _ imaging .",
    "we extract scaling exponents for the the gap energy @xmath5 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and show how the latter exhibits a strong dependence on the cell orientation and geometry .",
    "the scaling of the homogeneous binary bec ( @xmath0 ) can be recovered in the harmonically trapped system as long as the fitting region excludes the immediate vicinity of the critical point or , perhaps counterintuitively , by choosing a large cell that encapsulates half the system .",
    "we also study the miscible - immiscible transition as it is approached from the immiscible side , and find a non - trivial scaling exponent @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we compare our results with a local density approximation ( lda ) , and find qualitative agreement only for very specific orientations of the observation cell .",
    "we consider an ultracold bose gas with two distinguishable components that have equal mass @xmath9 and are trapped by the same harmonic potential @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the trapping frequencies along each direction .",
    "additionally , we consider the case where the confinement along the @xmath12-direction is tight ( @xmath13 ) so the axial degree of freedom is effectively frozen out .",
    "this assumption is accurate if the temperature @xmath14 and chemical potential @xmath15 are relatively small .",
    "the oblate geometry is ideal for experimental measurements of number fluctuations , which can be made via _ in situ _ column density imaging  @xcite .",
    "analytically integrating over the @xmath12-coordinate then allows us to work in the quasi - two dimensional ( quasi-2d ) regime with the spatial coordinates @xmath16 .",

    "an important result , is that fitting over the range @xmath48 = 0.1 - 0.9 ( i.e.  excluding the transition region ) produces values of @xmath84 that are close to unity for all cell sizes .",
    "we note that this is also the region where bogoliubov theory is expected to be quantitatively accurate as it excludes the strongly fluctuating region .",
    "in contrast , fitting only near the critical point ( @xmath88-@xmath56 ) results in @xmath84 parameters that are further from unity , particularly for the smallest cell ( cell a ) . the deviation from @xmath80 in smaller cells is a finite size effect , reflecting the fact that the dominant magnetic fluctuations are long - wavelength in nature ; when their characteristic length ( the spin healing length @xmath89 ) exceeds the cell size , deviations from the thermodynamic limit scaling ( eq .  ( [ eq : unifluc ] ) ) are expected .",
    "is expected to hold for finite cells but only when @xmath89 is much smaller than the cell size .",
    "] for cell c , this can not occur , as @xmath89 is limited by the size of the system itself .",
    "thus , cell c represents the closest analog to the thermodynamic limit that is achievable in the trapped system , which explains how the exponent remains close to unity when fitting to the transition region . additionally , in contrast to the uniform system , the local condensate densities in the trapped system decrease with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the fit parameters exhibit a residual dependence on the fit range , even for cell c.    we employ a local density approximation ( lda ) by applying the uniform result ( eq .  ( [ eq : unifluc ] ) ) to our numerical solutions ; we replace @xmath79 with the cell - weighted average density @xmath90 where @xmath91 , and we use the critical point for the trapped system , @xmath92 .",
    "it is remarkable how well the lda results agree with the full numerical calculation , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : flucscaling ] , where the lda results are shown by the red solid lines .",
    "away from the transition , the lda is more accurate when applied to cell a. in this case , the density is more uniform across the cell ( due to its small size ) , and the free - particle character of the magnetic fluctuations is less evident .",
    "as the transition is approached from the immiscible side , the behavior is more complicated and we do not have the luxury of being able to compare our results with an unambiguous thermodynamic limit .",
    "again , we fit our numerical results to scaling ( [ eq : critscale ] ) over various ranges of @xmath48 , and show the fitting parameters @xmath84 in table [ tab : fit ] . in this case",
    ", @xmath84 increases significantly with increasing cell size for all fitting ranges .",
    "furthermore , for cells a and b , @xmath84 is significantly larger for fits near the transition ( @xmath59-@xmath93 ) compared to the region further from the transition ( @xmath94-@xmath95 ) .",
    "in contrast , the fits for cell c are approximately constant over the various fitting ranges , giving @xmath96 near the transition , @xmath97 away from the transition , and @xmath98 over the broad range @xmath99-@xmath95 .",
    "this behavior arises because the large cell ( c ) is insensitive to the interface bending modes , due to geometry , and is instead representative of the steeply softening mixing - modes that drive the transition [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( d ) ] . the smaller cells ( a and b ) however",

    "fig : flucvspos ] ) . for the case of essentially uncoupled condensates ,",
    "@xmath100 , the behavior is similar to that of number fluctuations in a single component gas , which are subpoissonian at high density and superpoissonian at the low density condensate surface ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for cells positioned off - center ,",
    "the magnetic fluctuations tend to diverge on approach to the critical point .",
    "in contrast , the fluctuations clearly converge for cells positioned at the trap center . here , the cells become insensitive to the out - of - phase `` slosh '' modes , since magnetic fluctuations on opposite sides correlate and nullify . instead , the cells are most sensitive to the out - of - phase breathing modes ( third and fourth - to - lowest modes in fig .

    "fig : fig1](d ) ) , which converge to a finite value at the transition .",
    "the lda prediction is also plotted for @xmath48 = 0.01 and 0.9997 , shown by the solid red ( gray ) lines .",
    "while these results compare reasonably well with the full - numerical calculation for cell - position @xmath105 , the lda completely fails to capture the convergence of fluctuations at the trap center .",
    "the experimental realization of the system at hand could be achieved with two hyperfine states of the same atomic species @xcite or with different species @xcite . as",
    "an example set of parameters , we choose @xmath106 @xmath107rb atoms per component and @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the bohr radius .",
    "our value of @xmath110 then implies a @xmath12-confinement strength of @xmath111 hz . to observe magnetic fluctuations over two orders of magnitude on the miscible side , as we predict here , requires control of @xmath112 in the range 5@xmath109 to 100@xmath109 .",
    "we calculated the magnetic fluctuations at various temperatures on both sides of the transition , and found that although the magnitude depends on the temperature the scaling exponents do not , provided that the temperature is much higher than the energy of the low - lying fluctuating modes [ see softening modes in fig .  [",

    "we demonstrate that it is experimentally accessible to extract the exponent @xmath84 , associated with a diverging magnetic susceptibility , for the second - order miscible - immiscible transition in a trapped binary bose gas at very low but finite temperature .",
    "importantly , this involves _ in situ _ density measurements , which do not require high - resolution imaging .",
    "a large cell that spans half the system , e.g.  the region corresponding to @xmath115 , is the closest analog to the thermodynamic limit and provides the best means for extracting exponents on both sides of the transition . for the immiscible phase ,",
    "such a cell is crucial to avoid contributions from the interface bending modes , which do not drive the transition .    on the miscible side of the transition",
