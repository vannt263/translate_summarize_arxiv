    "the nuclear many - body problem of @xmath0 interacting nucleons can be solved exactly only in very specific cases or for very small particle numbers .",
    "this is due to the large number of degrees of freedom involved in such a complex system .",
    "let us for instance consider particles interacting through n hamiltonian written as @xmath1 then the exact ground state energy can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ... denote the one- , two- , ... body density matrices that contain all the information on the one- , two- ... body degrees of freedom respectively .",
    "a natural way to reduce the complexity of this problem is to assume that at a given level , the @xmath5body ( and higher - order ) density matrices becomes a functional of the lower - order ones .",
    "this is what is done for instance in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation where all @xmath6-body density matrices ( with @xmath7 ) become a functional of @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , the hf theory applied to the nuclear many - body problem in terms of the vacuum hamiltonian is a poor approximation and many - body theories beyond hf are necessary .",
    "the introduction of energy density functional ( edf ) approaches in the 70 s was a major breakthrough ( see for instance @xcite for a recent review ) . in its simplest form ,",
    "the edf formalism starts with an energy postulated as a functional of @xmath8 , the latter being built out of a slater determinant .",
    "then the ground state energy is obtained by minimizing the energy with respect to @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 parameters are generally adjusted on specific experimental observations and therefore encompass directly many - body correlations .",
    "current edf uses a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : simpleedf ] ) obtained by considering quasi - particle vacua as trial states . by making explicit use of symmetry breaking , such a functional called hereafter single - reference ( sr- ) edf is able to account for static correlation associated with pairing and deformation .",
    "actual sr - edf takes the form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the anomalous density . to restore symmetries and/or incorporate dynamical correlations , guided by the generator",
    "coordinate method ( gcm ) , a second level of edf implementation , namely multi - reference ( mr- ) edf is introduced .",
    "recently , difficulties with the formulation and implementation of have been encountered in mr - edf .",
    "a minimal solution has been proposed in ref . @xcite . besides these problems , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have pointed out the absence of a rigorous theoretical framework for the mr edf approach . at the heart of the problem",
    "is the possibility to break symmetries in functional theories and then restore them using configuration mixing .",
    "this issue needs to be thoroughly addressed in the future .    in this context , it is interesting to see if extensions of the functional used at the sr - edf level can grasp part of the effects that for standard functionals require the mr level .",
    "it is worth realizing that , in the canonical basis for which @xmath12 , we have @xmath13   = \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{i , j } \\bar v^{\\kappa \\kappa}_{i\\bar i j \\bar j } \\sqrt{n_i ( 1-n_i ) } \\sqrt{n_j ( 1-n_j ) } , \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore , the energy can be regarded as a functional of natural orbitals @xmath14 and occupation numbers @xmath15 . as a matter of fact , for electronic systems , gilbert has generalized the kohn - sham theory and shown that the exact energy of a system can be obtained by minimizing such a functional @xcite leading to the so - called density matrix functional theory ( dmft ) . the possibility to consider occupation numbers as building blocks of the nuclear energy functional",
    "has recently been discussed in ref .",
    "two levels of theory can be developed along the line of gilbert s idea ( i ) either , functionals in the strict gilbert framework can be designed . in that case , since the density identify with the exact density at the minimum , it should respect all symmetries of the bare hamiltonian .",
    "( ii ) or we exploit the concept of symmetry breaking . in the latter case , similarly to the sr - edf , strictly speaking we can not anymore rely on the theorem , but we may gain better physical insight with relatively simple functionals .",
    "the descriptive power of dmft is illustrated here in the two - level lipkin model @xcite . in this model , the hartree - fock ( hf ) theory fails to reproduce the ground state energy whereas configuration mixing like generator coordinate method ( gcm ) provides a suitable tool @xcite .",
    "therefore , the two - level lipkin model is perfectly suited both to illustrate that dmft could be a valuable tool and to provide an example of a functional for system with a `` shape '' like phase - transition . in this model ,",
    "one considers @xmath0 particles distributed in two n - fold degenerated shells separated by an energy @xmath16 .",
    "the associated hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the interaction strength while @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the quasi - spin operators defined as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are creation operators associated with the upper and lower levels respectively . due to the specific form of the lipkin hamiltonian , @xmath8 simply writes in the natural basis as @xmath26 . introducing the angle @xmath27 between the state @xmath28 and @xmath29 , leads to the following mean - field functional @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "this expression is easily obtained by generalizing the hartree - fock case ( recovered here if @xmath32 ) .",
    "the main challenge of the method is to obtain an accurate expression for @xmath33 . to get the functional , clearly identified cases from which properties of the functional could be inferred have been used@xcite , namely the @xmath34 case and the large @xmath0 limit . in the two - particles case ,",
    "the correlation energy can be analytically obtained and reads @xmath35 a simple extension of the @xmath34 case for larger number of particles is to assume that each pair contributes independently from the others leading to @xmath36 { \\cal e}^{^{{n=2}}}_{\\rm cor}$ ] .",
    "however , such a simple assumption leads to a wrong scaling behavior in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "indeed , in this case , @xmath37 as @xmath0 tends to infinity while a @xmath38 scaling is expected @xcite .",
    "to obtain the correct limit , a semi - empirical factor @xmath39 can be introduced such that @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the value @xmath42 has been retained using a fitting procedure .",
    "examples of results obtained by minimizing the functional given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : emflipkin ] ) and ( [ eq : coreta ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] for different particle numbers and interaction strengths . in all cases , a very good agreement ,",
    "much better than the hf case is found .     for @xmath43 to @xmath44 resp .",
    "from top to bottom . in each case , the corresponding hf ( dashed line ) and dmft ( filled circle ) minimum energy are shown .",
    "the dmft calculation is performed using the mean - field and correlation energy resp . given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : emflipkin ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : coreta ] ) with @xmath45 ( adapted from @xcite ) . ]",
    "the lipkin example suggests that dmft can be a valuable tool for describing ground state of a many - body system when symmetry breaking plays a significant role .",
    "the functional designed here is exact only in the @xmath34 .",
    "note that the functional proposed here breaks signature symmetry and therefore enters into the level ( ii ) of functional discussed in the introduction .",
    "the lipkin model is however rather schematic and can not be used as a guidance for realistic situations .",
    "the possibility to design a new accurate functional for nuclei remains a challenging problem .",
