    "one of the most popular quantum cryptographic primitives , except quantum key distribution , is the quantum secret sharing  ( qss ) protocols  @xcite .",
    "the primitive known as qss is a process of splitting a piece of quantum information into several parts , and then securely reconstructing the information , but certain subparts are not enough to restore the original quantum information .",
    "( in a strict sense , the secret sharing is different from the state sharing on its goal  @xcite , but we treat the protocols as in the same category .",
    ") there are huge number of theoretical studies on qss protocols , and also exist experimental demonstrations on qss schemes in continuous - variable regime , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "transmission or distribution of quantum information over several authorized nodes is essential for future applications in quantum communications .",
    "we here review the original qss scheme from the point of view of ( approximate ) private quantum channels ( pqc ) , and then propose an information transmission method , namely , @xmath1-secure quantum sequential transmission ( qst ) protocol .",
    "this protocol uses a concept of private quantum channel and aims to secure sequential transmission , where arbitrary quantum states pass through several authorized intermediate nodes ( or participants ) . in the transmission process",
    ", all nodes must collaborate to reveal the original quantum information . in the sequentially chained scheme",
    ", we exploit the pauli commutation relations on @xmath0-qubit quantum states , and derive the mathematical structure of multi - node @xmath1-randomizing maps .",
    "using the idea of the general three - party qss scheme , we construct our main protocol known as quantum sequential transmission protocol under the security parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 implies that security and efficiency of the protocols are dealt with an asymptotic consideration . shortly speaking",
    ", the quantum sequential transmission protocol can transmit any quantum states from one party to another under the consent of all authorized participants with classical secret bits .",
    "note that any input quantum states into a quantum channel are arbitrary quantum information with a given dimension , and we exclude classical information .",
    "thus we expect that the protocol , qst , can be applied to certain applications such as quantum repeater  @xcite , quantum key repeater  @xcite , quantum sealed - bid auction  @xcite or quantum email protocol , since only authorized users can send , confirm , and read the quantum message . furthermore , with the proposed schemes , we study the key question of finding minimal resources required to split and reconstruct a quantum state , and to transfer arbitrary quantum information sequentially .",
    "let us briefly review the quantum one - time pad or private quantum channel  ( pqc ) .",
    "et al_.  @xcite first proposed a quantum primitive known as a private quantum channel for secure transmission of quantum states , and already proved its security including the optimality  @xcite .",
    "the complete randomization method naturally gave births to _",
    "approaches for randomizing quantum states  @xcite .",
    "we here adopt an approximate version of the dickinson and nayak s pqc  @xcite , which has relatively few pauli operations on multi - qubit encodings .",
    "using conventions and definitions in sec .",
    "[ background ] , we construct a quantum communication protocol that are efficient and secure with a small information leakages  ( @xmath2 ) notwithstanding minimal use of resources .",
    "but , in this paper , we mainly focus our attention on constructing the mathematical structure of the @xmath1-secure quantum sequential transmission scheme ( qst ) .    before finishing the section",
    ", we introduce the basic concept of ( approximate ) pqc or @xmath1-randomizing map ( or also known as random unitary channel )",
    ". moreover we comment on security analysis from holevo bound and the correspondence between ( classical ) keys and pauli operations . in section  [ qst ] , we focus on our main construction of quantum sequential transmission protocol , which is one step more advanced form of the well - known three - party qss , on multi - party system . in section",
    "[ conclusion ] , we summarize and conclude our work .      for a given @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 , @xmath5 denotes the space of bounded linear operators on the space @xmath4 , and @xmath6 the unitary group on the space .",
    "we make use of a quantum map from @xmath5 to itself generally known as a quantum channel .",
    "then we can define a private quantum channel : for any @xmath7 , a completely positive and trace preserving  ( cptp ) map @xmath8 is said to be @xmath1-randomizing with respect to the trace norm if , for all quantum state @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the identity matrix of a given dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the input quantum source @xmath12 is a @xmath3-dimensional density matrix . the map @xmath13 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ epsran ] ) is the approximate private quantum channel  ( apqc ) , and @xmath14 denotes the trace norm for any matrix @xmath15 .",
    "note that the mapping @xmath13 is perfect ( or complete ) randomizing map if @xmath16 .",
    "the definition with the security parameter @xmath1 always implies perfect pqc , and gives us the informational security rather than a security based on the computational complexity .    a simple way to create",
    "such an invertible encoding map is to choose a certain sequence of unitary operators @xmath17 and define the encoding map as @xmath18 the index @xmath19 corresponds to the number of shared secret bits that all communicating parties share .",
    "we here assume that the secret bits are unknown to any eavesdroppers or unauthorized parties . with a suitable choice of @xmath20 unitary operators not more than @xmath21 , the mapping @xmath13 satisfies to be an approximate private quantum channel .",
    "in fact , any orthogonal set of @xmath21 unitary operations form a perfect private quantum channel .",
    "notice that the dimension @xmath3 of our case is fixed to @xmath22 to accommodate the hilbert space of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "if that is the case , how can we analyze the security of approximate private quantum channels ? roughly speaking , the accessible information to any attackers , for any quantum states @xmath23 supported on @xmath24 and @xmath25 , is bounded above by holevo information  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents an ensemble of @xmath28 s with probability @xmath29 s through the quantum channel @xmath13 , and @xmath30 , the von neumann entropy .",
    "the above inequality is true because the definition of the @xmath1-randomizing map with respect to the trace norm in eq .",
    "( [ epsran ] ) implies that the eigenvalues of the channel - output are almost uniformly distributed such that @xmath31 .",
    "this also means that attackers can not obtain any information about the information of the ensemble @xmath27 under the condition @xmath25 .    finally ,",
    "a relation between keys and pauli operators is crucial in the proof of following protocol , so we carefully investigate the key correspondence . an explicit construction for eq .",
    "( [ ruc ] ) depends on unitary operators chosen at random from the set of @xmath0-qubit pauli matrices . for two @xmath0-bit strings @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "let @xmath34 denotes the standard inner product on @xmath35 .",
    "we represent a tensor product of @xmath0 single qubit pauli operators by a string of @xmath36-bit @xmath37 , by using the following correspondence @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and @xmath42 the imaginary number .",
    "now , we define a set @xmath43 as @xmath44 for all tensor products of @xmath0 single qubit pauli operators .",
    "then the set @xmath43 forms a basis for the @xmath45 complex matrices .",
    "( note that the set @xmath46 is the usual pauli operators on single qubit . ) for convenience we substitute @xmath43 to @xmath47 under the correspondence in eq .",
    "( [ npauli ] ) to emphasize a classical key @xmath48 .",
    "as we mentioned above , @xmath0-qubit pauli operators form a basis for the set of all @xmath49 matrices .",
    "so , for a given density matrix @xmath12 , we can construct that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an element of a vector @xmath52 in @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the frobenius ( or hilbert - schmidt ) norm on the space .",
    "with additional modification of qss  @xcite and approximate private quantum channels , we now propose a quantum transmission protocol of so - called @xmath1-_secure _ quantum sequential transmission ( qst ) scheme .",
    "the main objective of our task is to send a unknown quantum information from a sender to a receiver when several authorized intermediate nodes exist .",
    "although the quantum information is transmitted sequential ways on concatenated quantum channels , the crucial advantage of this protocol is to preserving its explicit security and efficiency . in the sequential structure ,",
    "we take the generalized @xmath0-qubit pauli commutation relations on any input quantum signal , and prove the mathematical consistency and security of the chained @xmath1-randomizing maps .    as in three - party qss",
    "protocol , suppose that , for all @xmath19-th position , alice , bob and charlie share a correlation key such that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is fixed to 0 under the mod 2 operation .",
    "the main purpose of this protocol is to securely transmit a quantum state from alice to charlie through a middle party bob .",
    "the transmitted state between alice and charlie is asymptotically secure since the @xmath36-bit - key - based pqc makes arbitrary @xmath0-qubit state into a _ near _ maximally mixed state ( in three - party scenario ) .",
    "extending the idea of three - party protocol , we can directly generalize it to an @xmath58-party concatenated - transmission protocol within @xmath0-qubit pauli commutation relations .",
    "first , we simply take account of three - party protocol for sequential quantum state transmission .",
    "alice prepares an @xmath0-qubit quantum state @xmath59 and encodes the state to @xmath60 which will be transmitted to bob .",
    "( consideration of only pure states is enough since the convexity of trace norm ensures the previous statement . )",
    "bob also encodes the state , by using the correlation key @xmath61 , to @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes a composition of two pauli sets , and sends the state to the third party charlie .",
    "remember that @xmath64 , so the receiver charlie efficiently decodes the state to original quantum information @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ decode ] ) , we use the following identity , for any pauli operators , @xmath66 this condition for ( complete ) private quantum channel needs exactly @xmath36 secret bits .",
    "but if we use the approximate case of pqc , then we need about half - size ( @xmath67-bit ) keys only instead of @xmath36-bit keys @xcite , i.e. , for sufficiently large @xmath3 it satisfies our security level with small @xmath1 .",
    "-party quantum sequential transmission protocol : by using a secret classical information @xmath48 , a sender transmits any quantum state @xmath12 securely to final node through the @xmath68 and @xmath1-randomizing maps @xmath69 for all @xmath70 .",
    "boxes with @xmath47 represent the @xmath0-qubit pauli operations corresponding a key @xmath48 . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qst2 ] , @xmath58-party extension  ( @xmath71 ) of qst scheme is simple and natural , but we need some technical calculations as shown below .",
    "we note that every intermediate user also accomplishes the role of sender and receiver . before describing the @xmath58-party scenario ,",
    "we define a bias of a set of @xmath36-bit strings . for a given subset of @xmath72 ,",
    "if @xmath73 then we call the set @xmath74 is _ biased _ with respect to a string @xmath75  @xcite , where @xmath76 is an expectation value for some variable in @xmath74 . note that @xmath77 is also the inner product , and the bias is equal to @xmath78 - 1 $ ] under the modulo 2 operations .",
    "when , for all @xmath79 , @xmath80 , we call the subset @xmath72 to be @xmath81-biased .    a subset @xmath72 defines a cptp map on @xmath0-qubit as follows , @xmath82 where a real number @xmath83 is equal to the @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ bias ] ) .",
    "the modulus of @xmath74 , @xmath85 , corresponds to some number @xmath86 of @xmath0-qubit pauli operations used in the map @xmath87 . by using commutation relations on pauli matrices , above equations",
    "can be derived from @xmath88 if we choose @xmath89 , then we have a completely randomizing map",
    ". it is known that there _ exists _ a map @xmath87 an @xmath1-randomizing map with respect to the trace norm for @xmath0-qubit states , when the subset @xmath72 be a set with bias at most @xmath90 .",
    "( see also the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    from the existence of small @xmath81-bised subset @xmath74 , the frobenius norm of the randomized state is almost concentrated at the maximally mixed state , that is , @xmath91 this inequality can be directly calculated from the eq .",
    "( [ rerho ] ) of @xmath90-biasedness and the bound @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , for any density matrix @xmath92 , the inequalities @xmath93 and @xmath94 always hold .",
    "( see proof details in the appendix a of ref .",
    "thus we obtain the following chain bounds @xmath95 thus , if we can choose a suitable subset @xmath74 with @xmath81-biasedness , then we can always create @xmath1-randomizing map or apqc in trace norm . the above equation , eq .",
    "( [ epsran2 ] ) , is intrinsically identical to the eq .",
    "( [ epsran ] ) , therefore the security is well preserved .",
    "finally we show that multi - party approximate private quantum channel and multi - party quantum sequential transmission protocol is secure and efficient , i.e. , we claim that @xmath96 classical keys are sufficient for the @xmath58-party qst scheme . by choosing a dense subset @xmath74 ,",
    "we can initialize a subset @xmath97 to be a set with bias at most @xmath98 for each @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "then we assert that there exists an @xmath58-party @xmath1-randomizing map with respect to the trace norm for @xmath0-qubit states : for any density matrix @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 we here denote that @xmath101 for convenience .",
    "since the @xmath58-user encoding and transmitting for a quantum state under @xmath58-apqc form an @xmath58-party qst protocol , and it can be directly derived from the following commutation relation    @xmath102    this equation is just a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) .",
    "suppose that , for every quantum state @xmath99 , each @xmath1-randomizing map between two nodes @xmath103 satisfies @xmath104 then we can always construct multi - user qst protocol via approximate private quantum channels with @xmath105 and consume about @xmath0 bits of secret classical keys satisfying @xmath106 .",
    "this result implies that qst based on sequential private quantum channels is secure .",
    "the estimation of eq .",
    "( [ teps ] ) for every @xmath1 promises to use the classical key of @xmath107 bits  @xcite .",
    "notice that dickinson and nayak s efficient construction for the approximate pqc on @xmath0-qubit situation relies on mcdiarmid s inequality in probability analysis and a net argument on discretizing pure quantum states .",
    "strict security analysis for the approximate private quantum channel in security parameter @xmath1 are reported at ref .",
    "@xcite , and see also ref .  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we constructed a quantum communication protocol for quantum sequential and @xmath1-secure transmission scheme via the extension of three - party qss task .",
    "this scheme makes use of a relatively small ( correlated ) classical secret information of about @xmath108 bits , just half of the size or the perfect private quantum channel of @xmath36-bit , and transmit any @xmath0-qubit states securely , so we say that the protocol is efficient .",
    "the security argument only depends on the small security parameter @xmath1 in which an approximate private quantum channel guarantee its security .",
    "in fact , it is a small value ( @xmath109 ) for sufficiently large @xmath3-dimension of hilbert space @xmath24 .    beyond the mathematical construction of the quantum sequential transmission scheme , we need to exploit this type of communication protocols for potential future applications such as quantum ( key ) repeater , auction , and email scheme and so on .",
    "so , the analysis of these protocols in quantum regime is significant and necessary .",
    "we finally point out that the security of the qst protocol must be systematically analyzed for several cases of attackers , and further study is needed for mathematical generalization in @xmath110-norm cases ( for all @xmath111 ) .",
    "we hope that the quantum sequential transmission , qst , can be used for the realization of practical quantum communication networks .",
