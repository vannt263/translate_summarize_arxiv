    "stationary or static axially symmetric exact solutions to the einstein field equations representing relativistic thin disks are of great astrophysical importance since they can be used as models for certain galaxies , accretion disks , and the superposition of a black holes and a galaxy or an accretion disk as in the case of quasars .",
    "disk sources for stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with electromagnetic fields , especially magnetic fields , are also of astrophysical importance in the study of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation .",
    "in such situation one has to study the coupled einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "exact solutions which describe relativistic static thin disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite . also thin disks with radial tension",
    "were considered @xcite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static thin disks with or without radial pressure have been obtained by different authors @xcite@xcite . rotating thin disks that can be considered as a source of a kerr metric were presented by bick and ledvinka @xcite , while rotating disks with heat flow were were studied by gonzlez and letelier @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear superposition of a disk and a black hole was first obtained by lemos and letelier @xcite .",
    "perfect fluid disks with halos were studied by vogt and letelier @xcite .",
    "the stability of some general relativistic thin disks models using a first order perturbation of the energy - momentum tensor was investigated by ujevic and letelier @xcite .",
    "thin disks in precense of electromagnetic field have been discussed as sources for kerr - newman fields @xcite , magnetostatic axisymmetric fields @xcite , conformastationary metrics @xcite , while models of electrovacuum static counterrotating dust disks were presented in @xcite .",
    "charged perfect fluid disks were also studied by vogt and letelier @xcite , and charged perfect fluid disks as sources of static and taub - nut - type spacetimes by garca - reyes and gonzlez @xcite .    in all the above cases ,",
    "the disks are obtained by an `` inverse problem '' approach , called by synge the `` _ g - method _ ''",
    "the method works as follows : a solution of the vacuum einstein equations is taken , such that there is a discontinuity in the derivatives of the metric tensor on the plane of the disk , and the energy - momentum tensor is obtained from the einstein equations",
    ". the physical properties of the matter distribution are then studied by an analysis of the surface energy - momentum tensor so obtained .",
    "another approach to generate disks is by solving the einstein equations given a source ( energy - momentum tensor ) .",
    "essentially , they are obtained by solving a riemann - hilbert problem and are highly nontrivial @xcite@xcite .",
    "a review of this kind of disks solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations was presented by klein in @xcite .",
    "now , when the inverse problem approach is used for static spacetimes , the energy - momentum tensor is diagonal and its analysis is direct and , except for dust disks , the solutions obtained have anisotropic sources with azimuthal stress different from the radial stress . on the other hand , when the considered spacetime is stationary , the obtained energy - momentum tensor is non - diagonal and the analysis of its physical content is more involved and , in general , the obtained source is not only anisotropic but with nonzero heat flow . due to this fact , there are very few works about of stationary disks and they are limited to disks without heat flow @xcite .",
    "indeed , only in one work disks with heat flow has been considered , but only a partial analysis of the corresponding energy - momentum tensor was made @xcite .",
    "the above disks can also be interpreted as made of two counterrotating streams of freely moving ( charged ) particles , i.e. , which move along ( electro-)geodesics , as was also indicated in @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is obtained by means of the counterrotating model ( crm ) in which the energy - momentum tensor of the source is expressed as the superposition of two counterrotating fluids .",
    "now , even though this interpretation can be seen as merely theoretical , there are observational evidence of disks made of counterrotating matter as in the case of certain @xmath0 and @xmath1 galaxies @xcite@xcite . has also been observed in some spiral galaxies as in ngc3626 the presence of counterrotating ionized ( charged ) gas disks @xcite .",
    "indeed recent investigations have shown that there is a large number of galaxies ( the first was ngc4550 in virgo ) @xcite which show counterrotating streams in the disk with up to @xmath2 counterrotation .",
    "it is believe that the presence of counterrotating matter components in these galaxies is the consecuence of the accretion or merger of galaxies .",
    "thus these counterrotating streams may be the result from the capture by a massive early - type galaxy of a gas - rich dwarf galaxy that was orbiting in the opposite sense to the rotation of the main galaxy .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold . in first instance",
    ", we present a analysis of the energy - momentum tensor and the surface current density for electrovacuum stationary axially symmetric relativistic thin disks of infinite extension without radial stress and when there is heat flow . and ,",
    "in the second place , we present a study of the counterrotating model ( crm ) for these stationary thin disks .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec . ii we present a summary of the procedure to obtain models of rotating thin disks with a purely azimuthal pressure and currents , using the well known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method extended to solutions of einstein - maxwell equations . in particular , we obtain expressions for the surface energy - momentum tensor and the surface current density of the disks .    in sec .",
    "iii the disks are interpreted in terms of the crm .",
    "we find a general constraint over the counterrotating tangential velocities needed to cast the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk as the superposition of two counterrotating charged fluids made of dust or pressureless matter ( collisionless particles ) .",
    "we show that , in general , it is not possible to take the two counterrotating fluids as circulating along electro - geodesics nor take the two counterrotating tangential velocities as equal and opposite .    in the following section , sec .",
    "iv , a family of models of counterrotaing and rotating relativistic thin disks based on a magnetized and charged kerr - nut metric is considered .",
    "this metric has as limiting cases a charged and magnetized taub - nut solution and the well known kerr - newman solutions .",
    "we show that for kerr - newman fields the eigenvalues of the energy - momentum tensor of the disk are for all the values of the parameters real quantities so that this disks do not present heat flow in any case , whereas for charged and magnetized kerr - nut and taub - nut fields we find always regions with heat flow .",
    "we then analyze the crm for these disks and we study the angular velocities , surface energy densities and electric charge densities of both streams when the two fluids move along electrogeodesics and when they move with equal and opposite velocities .",
    "also the stability against radial perturbation is analyzed in all the cases . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we summarize our main results .",

    "these disks are essentially of infinite extension .",
    "finite disks can be obtained introducing oblate spheroidal coordinates , which are naturally adapted to a disk source , and imposing appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "these solutions , in the vacuum and static case , correspond to the morgan and morgan solutions @xcite .",
    "a more general class of solutions representating finite thin disks can be constructed using a method based on the use of conformal transformations and solving a boundary - value problem @xcite .",
    "now , in order to analyze the matter content of the disks is necessary to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for the semt ( [ eq : emt1 ] ) - ( [ eq : emt4 ] ) @xmath36 has the solutions @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for the metric ( [ eq : met ] ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44    we only consider the case when @xmath45 , so that the two eigenvalues @xmath46 are real and different and the two eigenvectors are orthogonal , in such a way that one of them is timelike and the other is spacelike . since @xmath47 , from ( [ eq : norm ] ) follows that when @xmath48 the negative sign corresponds to the timelike eigenvector while the positive sign to the spacelike eigenvector .",
    "when @xmath49 we have the opposite case .",
    "so the function @xmath50 determines the sign of the norm .",
    "let @xmath51 be the timelike eigenvector , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 the spacelike eigenvector , @xmath54 . in terms of the orthonormal tetrad or comoving observer @xmath55 , the semt and the surface electric current density",

    "these condition characterizes a disk made of matter with the usual gravitational attractive property .",
    "consequently @xmath50 must be taken positive .",
    "so we have @xmath63 and    @xmath64    where @xmath65 so that the sign is chosen according to the causal character of the timelike eigenvector ( observer s four - velocity ) ,    @xmath66    where @xmath67    when @xmath68 , the eigenvalues @xmath46 and the eigenvectors @xmath69 are complex conjugates , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . in a comoving orthonormal tetrad @xmath72 the eigenvectors",
    "@xmath73 can be expressed as @xmath74 .",
    "so we can write the semt in the canonical form @xmath75 so that it can be interpreted as the energy - momentum tensor of a matter distribution with propagation of heat in the tangential direction . the energy density , the azimuthal pressure , and the heat flow function are respectively @xmath76",
    "we now consider , based on refs . @xcite and @xcite , the possibility that the semt @xmath77 and the current density @xmath78 can be written as the superposition of two counterrotating charged fluids that circulate in opposite directions ; that is , we assume    @xmath79    where the quantities on the right - hand side are , respectively , the semt and the current density of the prograde and retrograde counterrotating fluids .",
    "let @xmath80 be the velocity vectors of the two counterrotating fluids , where @xmath81 are the angular velocities of each stream . in order to do the decomposition ( [ eq : emtsum ] ) and ( [ eq : corsum ] ) we project the velocity vectors onto the tetrad @xmath82 , using the relations @xcite @xmath83 in terms of the tetrad ( [ eq : tetrad ] ) we can write @xmath84 so that    @xmath85    where @xmath86 are the tangential velocities of the streams with respect to the tetrad .",
    "another quantity related with the counterrotating motion is the specific angular momentum of a particle rotating at a radius @xmath8 , defined as @xmath87 .",
    "this quantity can be used to analyze the stability of circular orbits of test particles against radial perturbations .",
    "the condition of stability , @xmath88 is an extension of rayleigh criteria of stability of a fluid in rest in a gravitational field @xcite . for an analysis of the stability of a rotating fluid taking into account",

    "@xcite .    substituting ( [ eq : va ] ) and ( [ eq : wa ] ) in ( [ eq : emtqcov ] ) we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 clearly , in order to cast the semt in the form ( [ eq : emtsum ] ) , the mixed term must be absent and therefore the counterrotating tangential velocities must satisfy the following constraint @xmath91 where we assume that @xmath92 .    then , assuming a given choice for the tangential velocities in agreement with the above relation , we can write the semt as ( [ eq : emtsum ] ) with @xmath93 so that we have two counterrotating dust fluids with energy densities , measured in the coordinates frames , given by @xmath94   ( \\epsilon v _ \\mp - q ) , \\label{eq : epcon}\\ ] ] thus the semt @xmath77 can be written as the superposition of two counterrotating dust fluids if , and only if , the constraint ( [ eq : liga ] ) admits a solution such that @xmath95 .    similarly , substituting ( [ eq : va ] ) and ( [ eq : wa ] ) in ( [ eq : ja ] ) we can write the current density as ( [ eq : corsum ] ) with @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the counterrotating electric charge densities , measured in the coordinates frames , which are given by @xmath98 ( \\mbox{\\sl j}^{\\hat 1 } - \\mbox{\\sl j}^{\\hat 0 } v_\\mp   ) . \\label{eq : sig}\\ ] ] thus , we have a disk makes of two counterrotating charged dust fluids with energy densities given by ( [ eq : epcon ] ) , and electric charge densities given by ( [ eq : sig ] ) .    as we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vels ] ) , ( [ eq : epcon ] ) and ( [ eq : sig ] ) , all the main physical quantities associated with the crm depend on the counterrotating tangential velocities @xmath99 .",
    "however , the constraint ( [ eq : liga ] ) does not determine @xmath99 uniquely so that we need to impose some additional requirement in order to obtain a complete determination of the tangential velocities leading to a well defined crm .",
    "a possibility , commonly assumed @xcite , is to take the two counterrotating streams as circulating along electrogeodesics .",
    "now , if the electrogeodesic equation admits solutions corresponding to circular orbits , we can write this equation as @xmath100 in terms of @xmath101 we obtain @xmath102 from ( [ eq : emtsum ] ) , ( [ eq : corsum ] ) , ( [ eq : sabcon ] ) , and ( [ eq : jacon ] ) we have    @xmath103    and substituting ( [ eq : sigmau0 ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilonu02 ] ) in ( [ eq : elecgeo1 ] ) we find @xmath104 and using ( [ eq : omegapm ] ) we obtain @xmath105 ( g_{11,r } \\omega _ \\pm ^2 + 2g_{01,r } \\omega _ \\pm + g_{00,r } )   =    \\nonumber   \\\\   - [ s^{01}\\mbox{\\sl j}^1 - s^{11}\\mbox{\\sl j}^0       +   \\omega_\\pm ( s^{01 } \\mbox{\\sl j}^0 - s^{00}\\mbox{\\sl j}^1 ) ] ( a _ { t , r } + a_{\\varphi , r } \\omega _ { \\pm } ) .",

    "we get @xmath109 , \\label{eq : vrotcon}\\ ] ] and , by using ( [ eq : omega ] ) , we have that @xmath110 so that , using ( [ eq : emtcov ] ) , we get @xmath111 .",
    "\\label{eq : liga3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , using the einstein - maxwell equation ( [ eq : lamz ] ) follows immediately that @xmath112 vanishes and therefore the electrogeodesic velocities satisfy the constraint ( [ eq : liga ] ) and so , if the electrogeodesic equation admits solutions corresponding to circular orbits , we have a well defined crm . when there is heat flow a proof as the previous one is not trivial and in this case we take the counterrotating hypothesis ( [ eq : sabcon ] ) and ( [ eq : jacon ] ) as an ansatz .",
    "another possibility is to take the two counterrotating fluids not circulating along electrogeodesics but with equal and opposite tangential velocities , @xmath113 this choice , that imply the existence of additional interactions between the two streams ( e.g. collisions ) , leads to a complete determination of the velocity vectors .",
    "however , this can be made only when @xmath114 .",
    "so in precense of heat flow by eq .",
    "( [ eq : enprq ] ) we have @xmath115 which corresponds to an imaginary velocity and therefore these disks have an unphysical behavior in the regions where there is heat flow .    in the general case ,",
    "the two counterrotating streams circulate with different velocities and we can write ( [ eq : liga ] ) as @xmath116 however , this relation does not determine completely the tangential velocities , and therefore the crm is undetermined . in summary , the counterrotating tangential velocities can be explicitly determined only if we assume some additional relationship between them , like the equal and opposite condition or the electro - geodesic condition .",
    "now , can happen that the obtained solutions do not satisfy any of these two conditions .",
    "that is , the counterrotating velocities are , in general , not completely determined by the constraint ( [ eq : liga ] ) .",
    "thus , the crm is in general undetermined since the counterrotaing energy densities and pressures can not be explicitly written without a knowledge of the counterrotating tangential velocities .",
    "as an example of the above presented formalism , we consider thin disk models obtained by means of the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method applied to the electromagnetic generalization of the kerr - nut metric , which can be written as    @xmath117 , \\\\",

    "we see that for charged and magnetized kerr - nut disks @xmath183 is everywhere positive whereas @xmath184 becomes negative after certain value of @xmath158 in violation of the weak energy condition .",
    "therefore for charged and magnetized kerr - nut fields one finds that only the central region of the these disks presents a physically reasonable behavior .",
    "thus these disks only model the inner portions of galaxies or acretion disks .",
    "however , since the surface energy density decreases rapidly one can to define a cut off radius at the point where the energy density changes of sign and , in principle , we consider these disks as finite so that we can use them to model the whole galaxy or acretion disk .",
    "by contrast for kerr - newman disks the counterrotating energy densities are always positive quantities .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : electro]@xmath170 - [ fig : electro]@xmath185 we plotted the electric charge densities @xmath186 .",

    "[ fig : electro]@xmath188 - [ fig : electro]@xmath189 we have drawn the specific angular momenta @xmath190 for the same values of the parameters .",
    "we see that for charged and magnetized kerr - nut disks there is a strong change in the slope at certain values of @xmath158 , which means that there is a strong instability there .",
    "we also find regions with negative slope where the crm is also unstable .",
    "however , these disks models are stable in the central region and away of the center of the disks .",
    "meanwhile for kerr - newman disks we find that the presence of electromagnetic field can also make unstable these disks against radial perturbations .",

    "we also computed this functions for other values of @xmath192 and @xmath193 and , in all the cases , we found the same behavior .",
    "second we consider the case when the two fluids move with equal and opposite tangential velocities ( non - electrogeodesic motion ) for charged and magnetized kerr - nut disks with @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 . in fig .",

    "we see that the quantity @xmath196 is also always less than the light velocity , but after of certain value of @xmath8 becomes negative .",
    "therefore these disks are also well behaved only in the central region of the disk . in figs .",
    "[ fig : noelectro]@xmath161 - [ fig : noelectro]@xmath179 we have plotted the energy densities @xmath197 and the electric charge densities @xmath198 .",
    "we see that this quantities have a similar behavior to the previous cases . in figs .",
    "[ fig : noelectro]@xmath181 and [ fig : noelectro]@xmath199 we have drawn the specific angular momena @xmath200 and @xmath201 for the same values of the parameters .",
    "we find that these disks models are stable only in the central region of the disks . in the case of charged and magnetized taub - nut disks",
    "we also find that the physical quantities have a similar behavior to the charged and magnetized kerr - nut disks , and in the case of kerr - newman disks to the previous ones .    finally , the figs .",
    "[ fig : disenprq ] - [ fig : noelectro ] show that the two fluids are continuous in @xmath8 which implies to have two particles in counterrotating movement in the same point in spacetime .",
    "so this model could be possible when the distance between streams ( or between the counterrotating particles ) were very small in comparing with the length @xmath8 so that we can consider , in principle , the fluids continuous like is the case of counterrotating gas disks present in disk galaxies .",
    "we presented a detailed analysis of the energy - momentum tensor and the surface current density for electrovacuum stationary axially symmetric relativistic thin disks without radial stress and when there is heat flow .",
    "the surface energy - momentum tensor and the surface current density were expressed in terms of the comoving tetrad and explicit expressions were obtained for the kinematical and dynamical variables that characterize the disks .",
    "that is , we obtained expressions for the velocity vector of the disks , as well for the energy density , azimuthal pressure , electric charge density and azimuthal current density .",
    "we also presented in this paper the stationary generalization of the counterrotating model ( crm ) for electrovacuum thin disks that had been previously only analyzed for the static case in @xcite .",
    "we considered both counter rotation with equal and opposite velocities and counter rotation along electrogeodesics .",
    "a general constraint over the counterrotating tangential velocities was obtained , needed to cast the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk in such a way that can be interpreted as the superposition of two counterrotating dust fluids .",
    "the constraint obtained is the generalization of the obtained for the vacuum case in @xcite , for disks without radial pressure and with heat flow , where we only consider counterrotating fluids circulating along geodesics .",
    "we also found that , in general , there is not possible to take the two counterrotating tangential velocities as equal and opposite neither take the two counterrotating fluids as circulating along geodesics .",
    "a family of models of counterrotating and rotating relativistic thin disks based on a charged and magnetized kerr - nut metric are constructed where we obtain some disks with a crm well behaved .",
    "this solution has as limiting cases a charged and magnetized taub - nut solution and the well known kerr - newman solutions . for charged and magnetized kerr - nut and taub - nut fields",
    "we find that these disks always present heat flow , whereas for kerr - newman fields we shows that these disks can be interpreted , for all the values of parameters , as a matter distribution with currents and purely azimuthal pressure and without heat flow .",
