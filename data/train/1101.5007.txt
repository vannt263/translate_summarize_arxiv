    "measurements of the clustering of galaxies allows one to investigate the relationship between dark and luminous matter . by comparing galaxies selected in different ways one gains understanding of how different galaxies trace the underlying dark matter and also of processes at work in galaxy evolution",
    "this information is important when using galaxies as probes of cosmological parameters .",
    "a number of new radio telescopes , such as the meerkat , askap and the ska , are in the pipeline and they will detect huge numbers of galaxies using hi . a reliable measure of the bias of hi - selected galaxies and insight into the evolution of the bias is important for forecasting the capabilities of telescopes which will probe hi at intermediate or high - redshifts .",
    "the clustering of hi - selected galaxies has been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they used data from the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass , @xcite ) , a blind survey for hi of the southern sky which generated a catalogue of 4315 sources , the bulk of which have redshifts below @xmath0 .",
    "they showed that hi - selected galaxies are less clustered than galaxies selected in other ways .",
    "@xcite investigated clustering of various subsamples of hipass galaxies , showing that galaxies with high rotation velocities are more clustered than those with lower rotation velocities .",
    "there were indications that galaxies containing more hi are also more clustered but the differences were not as pronounced as in @xcite .",
    "the latter work also measures the bias of hipass galaxies relative to the expected dark matter distribution .    in this paper",
    "we measure the clustering of hi - selected galaxies detected with the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) and compiled in the partially completed alfalfa survey ( the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey , @xcite ) .",
    "the results are compared with those obtained for hipass .",
    "clustering measurements in hipass are limited to large angular scales where the beam - size of @xmath1 arcmins does not cause confusion .",
    "the alfalfa resolution is more than four times better allowing us to probe clustering on smaller scales .",
    "the rms noise per alfalfa beam is about six times smaller , providing a catalogue of sources which spans a wider range of redshifts and includes galaxies with lower hi masses .",
    "we are thus able to measure clustering of hi - selected galaxies in regimes that have not yet been explored and to investigate trends seen in hipass , using an independent survey .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec : data ] we give a short introduction to the hipass and alfalfa surveys .",
    "the computation of the angular and spatial two - point correlation functions is described in   [ sec : twopoint ] .",
    "the results are presented , discussed and compared with earlier work in   [ sec : results ] . finally , ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] concludes with a short summary .",
    "hipass covers all the southern sky with @xmath2 and and can detect hi with velocities in the range @xmath3 . the rms noise per beam",
    "is @xmath4 mjy @xcite . to exclude structure associated with the milky - way , like high - velocity clouds and low mass satellites , we only use sources with recessional velocities larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the average mass of hi in hipass galaxies is @xmath6 .    when completed , the alfalfa survey @xcite will cover @xmath7 of sky with high galactic latitude and to a depth of @xmath8 . the rms noise of the survey is @xmath9 mjy and the beam - size is @xmath10 arcminutes .",
    "currently the alfalfa survey contains three strips covering a total area of @xmath11 .",
    "these are the two strips centred on the virgo region and the anti - virgo strip .",
    "they contain 1796 sources with @xmath12 .",
    "the first completed virgo strip is defined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 and contains @xmath15 sources .",
    "the second virgo strip contains @xmath16 galaxies within @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the anti - virgo strip contains @xmath19 sources within @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a circular region , with radius of @xmath22 centred on m  87 , has been removed from the survey area due to the interference of m  87 @xcite .",
    "the average alfalfa hi mass is @xmath23 .",
    "the source density of the alfalfa catalogue is approximately 20 times higher than that of the hipass survey .",
    "plot of the normalised redshift distribution of the hipass and alfalfa surveys as well as the distribution of the alfalfa sources in the three , spatially separated strips . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : norm ] displays the normalised redshift distributions of the hipass and alfalfa surveys as well as the redshift distributions in the three separate alfalfa regions . a redshift of @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath25 which is roughly the distance to the coma supercluster .",
    "the high galaxy density near the coma cluster and virgo cluster are evident in the redshift distributions shown for the virgo regions . in the anti - virgo region the effect of the perseus - pisces supercluster can also be seen as a slight enhancement of galaxies at a redshift of about @xmath26 .",
    "below , we will discuss the impact of these inhomogeneities on the determination of the two - point correlation function .",
    "here we review some basic properties of the angular and projected two - point correlation functions ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively ) and indicate their relations to the three dimensional ( 3-d ) real - space two - point correlation function , @xmath29 .",
    "subsequently , we introduce the estimator used here and discuss the construction of the random samples .",
    "we do not employ the weighted correlation functions used in @xcite as we are interested in comparing the results of the two surveys and in comparing our results with those predicted for dark matter within a @xmath30cdm model .",
    "the unweighted measurements suffice for this work and we are able to check our unweighted results against those of @xcite .",
    "the angular correlation function , @xmath27 , is a simple measure of the clustering of galaxies as a function of angular separation on the sky , @xmath31 , which does not require redshift information .",
    "it is calculated by counting galaxy pairs within a given angular separation bin and comparing this number to a corresponding figure derived from a random catalogue with the same area and shape .",
    "the angular correlation , @xmath32 , gives the excess probability , over random , of finding two galaxies separated by angle @xmath31 .",
    "if we assume a redshift - dependent power law describes the 3-d real - space correlation function , @xmath33 ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) then the angular correlation function is related to the spatial correlation function by the limber equation @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the comoving distance and @xmath36 is the redshift number density distribution of the sources ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : norm ] ) .",
    "we use @xmath37 , consistent with the expected clustering behaviour in linear theory , although the surveys are so shallow that the evolution of @xmath29 could be ignored .",
    "the measured values for the logarithmic slope @xmath38 and the correlation length @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) can then be used to determine the 3-d parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the errors for @xmath27 are calculated using jack - knife re - sampling @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the data are split up into @xmath43 ra - bins and the correlation function is recalculated repeatedly each time leaving out a different bin .",
    "thus a set of @xmath43 values @xmath44 for the correlation function are obtained and the jack - knife error of the mean , @xmath45 , is given by @xmath46 the hipass sample has been divided into 24 ra bins while for the alfalfa catalogue we use 12 bins such that each bin contains approximately the same area of the sky .",
    "the projected correlation function , @xmath47 , is determined by the number of pairs at given radial and projected separations , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and a subsequent integration along the radial direction . for that purpose",
    "the absolute radial distance between a pair of galaxies , @xmath50 , and their angular separation , @xmath31 , are converted into a projected distance , @xmath51\\tan(\\theta/2)$ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the limit where the integral converges . here",
    "we set @xmath54 .",
    "the projected correlation function is related to the real - space correlation function by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath55 assuming that the projected and real - space correlation functions follow power laws within the region of interest ( @xmath56 ) , the parameter for the real - space correlation function can be derived from the projected one by the following expression : @xmath57 more specifically , we calculate @xmath41 and @xmath42 by fitting a power law , @xmath58 , using the levenberg - marquardt nonlinear least - squares method .",
    "the parameters of the real - space correlation function are then given by @xmath59^{-\\frac{1}{a_\\sigma } } \\label{equ : r}\\ ] ] @xmath60 therefore , similar to the angular correlation function the projected correlation function can be used to determine the real - space clustering .",
    "we apply both methods to determine the real - space clustering strength based on the hipass and the alfalfa surveys and compare the results .",
    "three different estimators are commonly used to determine the two - point correlation function . in this work",
    "we use the @xcite estimator as it reduces errors caused by edges and holes within a given catalogue . in particular this",
    "is important for the alfalfa survey with the hole caused by m  87 @xcite and the large edge effects due to the three strips .",
    "the estimator is of the form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the separation distance which has different meanings for the different correlation functions . for the angular correlation it denotes the separation angle , @xmath31 , for the projected correlation function it is the projected distance , @xmath49 , and for the real - space correlation it indicates the real - space distance @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is the number of data - data pairs , @xmath65 is the number of data - random pairs , and @xmath66 is the number of random - random pairs all with separations @xmath62 .",
    "the random catalogues were generated with uniform distributions on the sky and redshift distributions which resemble the distribution of recessional velocities in the survey smoothed using kernel density estimation @xcite . throughout this work we use random samples that are equal in size compared to the corresponding data set .",
    "we repeat the random catalogue generation 20 times and the calculation of random pairs in order to reduce the variance from the random sampling .      based on limber s equation , the redshift distributions of hipass and alfalfa and the expression for the non - linear power spectrum discussed in @xcite we predict the angular correlation function of dark matter using the cosmological parameters given in @xcite .",
    "the bias parameter , @xmath67 , at various angles is then determined by @xmath68",
    "angular correlation functions for hipass and alfalfa .",
    "error bars were calculated using jack - knife sampling .",
    "the solid red line and the small - dashed blue line show the corresponding power law fits for angles between @xmath69 and @xmath70 for alfalfa and between @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the hipass data .",
    "the projected clustering of dark matter ( in a @xmath30cdm model ) with redshift distributions of hipass and alfalfa are shown by the green dashed line and the magenta dotted line respectively ]    figure  [ fig : angular ] shows the angular correlation functions for hipass and alfalfa data as well as the predicted correlation functions of cold dark matter weighted with the redshift distributions of the surveys .",
    "the straight lines are power law fits for pair separations in the range between @xmath69 and @xmath70 for alfalfa and between @xmath71 and @xmath72 for hipass",
    ". the effect of source confusion in hipass is evident at smaller angular scales .",
    "the corresponding parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath73 , are given in table  [ tab : angular ] .",
    "the measured slopes in the two surveys agree reasonably well . as expected , the value of @xmath39 is lower for alfalfa since it is deeper than hipass and the clustering in 3-d is washed out in the 2-d projection .",
    "alfalfa also detects galaxies with lower hi masses which are potentially less clustered .",
    ".[tab : angular ] the angular clustering fitted parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath73 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the virgo regions contain over - densities of galaxies that are associated with the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "there is the concern that the results will be biased by the presence of such dominant large - scale structure within the relatively small survey fields . to investigate this ,",
    "the correlation functions of the three regions were calculated separately and are shown in figure  [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "measurements in the three regions agree to within their uncertainties , indicating that the presence of the big clusters within the virgo regions do not effect the results significantly .",
    "we note however , that the anti - virgo region is near the perseus - pisces supercluster which causes a slight over - density in that field at a similar redshift ( @xmath74 ) . to be sure that over - densities in all three fields at this redshift were not biasing our results",
    ", we cut the galaxies with redshifts between @xmath75 and @xmath76 out of the samples and recalculated the correlation functions .",
    "the results are also shown in figure  [ fig : comparison ] and it is clear that the correlation functions with and without the redshift cuts are completely consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "as an additional check on the effect of the small fields on the measured clustering strength , we calculated the integral constraint @xcite for a single field , and obtained a value of @xmath77 which indicates an effect within the uncertainty of the correlation function derived from the alfalfa data .",
    "we have measured the clustering of hi - selected galaxies using the alfalfa survey data and compared this with results for hipass .",
    "our two methods for determining the real - space correlation function agree well and our results for hipass agree with those found by @xcite .",
    "the real - space clustering in alfalfa appears to be even lower than in hipass , consistent with the idea that alfalfa probes galaxies with lower hi - masses that are less clustered than their high - mass counterparts .",
    "our measurements of high- and low - mass subsamples in alfalfa do not provide evidence to support this idea but the uncertainties on the measurements are large .",
    "we have calculated the clustering of dark matter expected within a @xmath30cdm model with redshift distributions of hipass and alfalfa .",
    "we then calculated the bias of alfalfa sources over the range @xmath78 , finding a value of 0.62 at @xmath22 and an average value of 0.52 over the whole range .",
    "the significant anti - bias of galaxies with low hi - mass is important to consider when estimating the signal - to - noise of experiments planned for the ska and its pathfinders .",
    "we thank the south african square kilometre array project , national research foundation and centre for high performance computing for support .",
    "we also thank the referee for helpful comments ."
