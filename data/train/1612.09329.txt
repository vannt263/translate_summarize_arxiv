    "one of the task of the new lhc run at 13 tev ( and 14 tev ) would be the improvement of all the aforementioned measurements and perform new ones such as @xmath22 as well as a triple self coupling of the higgs which are still missing .",
    "it is expected that the new run of lhc will pin down the uncertainty of @xmath10 and @xmath11 to @xmath23-@xmath24 and @xmath25-@xmath26 respectively for bottom quark and tau lepton .",

    "moreover , in the clean environment of the @xmath31 linear collider ( lc ) which can act as a higgs factory , the uncertainties on @xmath32 and @xmath11 would be much smaller and reach @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 couplings respectively  @xcite .",
    "the above accuracy on fermionic higgs decay measurements , if reached , are of comparable size to the effect of radiative corrections to some higgs decays .",

    "we will also use our calculations to evaluate the ratio of branching fractions of higgs decays in the 2hdm  @xcite : @xmath41 such a ratio of higgs boson decay widths is independent of the production process and therefore is insensitive to higher - order qcd corrections and also to new physics effects that may affect the production rate of the higgs .",
    "this ratio has also the particularity of being less sensitive to the systematic errors ( which drop out in the ratio ) and could be used to disentangle sm from other models such as 2hdm or supersymmetric models .",

    "notice also that in 2hdm type i , the @xmath122 ratio is all time less than one while in type ii it could be both : larger than one and smaller than one .",

    "we have shown that in type ii and iv the electroweak radiative corrections are rather small once we take into account that the heavy states @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 have a mass greater than 480 gev while it could be slightly larger for 2hdm type i and iii .",

    "+ we conclude that at the lc , where it is expected that higgs couplings to fermions can be measured with percent level precision , it would be possible to distinguish between various 2hdm models by looking to these quantum effects in higgs observables which are shown here to be larger than few percent in some cases .",
