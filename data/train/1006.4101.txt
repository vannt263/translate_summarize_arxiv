    "in 1970 , zeldovich suggested that the large - scale structure of the universe such as sheets and filaments form through the anisotropic collapse of large - scale density fluctuations along the principal axes of the gravitational tidal fields @xcite .",

    "the dark matter halos that condense out first on the smallest scales merge anisotropically along the principal axes of the tidal fields into larger and larger structures .",

    "to understand the formation and evolution of the large - scale structure , an important question to answer is how frequently the halos merge into filaments and under what circumstances the halo - to - filament merging event occurs efficiently .",
    "@xcite have for the first time evaluated analytically the merging rates of bound halos by extending the original press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "their analytic work was later refined and complimented by numerical calculation of merger trees from n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite constructed merger trees from the large millennium run halo catalogs @xcite and found that the mean merging rate per halo can be well modeled by a nearly universal fitting formula .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that the prediction of the extended press - schechter formalism for the halo merging rates disagrees with the numerical results from the millennium run halo catalog by up to a factor of a few .",
    "the halo - to halo merging rates were originally derived under the assumption that the merging events occur in a hierarchical way .",
    "if the matter content of the universe were composed purely of cdm particles , then the structure formation would proceed in a strictly hierarchical way . however , if the non - cdm particles ( either warm or hot ) coexist with the cdm particles , the pure hierarchy in the build - up of the large - scale structure would break down at some level , depending on their mass fraction @xcite .",
    "true as it is that the current observations put a tight constraint on the amount of the possible non - cdm particles , they have not been completely excluded . as a matter of fact , the existence of non - cdm particles have been suggested as one possible solution to alleviate the apparent mismatches between observations and the predictions of @xmath14cdm cosmology on the subgalactic scales ( see * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we study the effect of massive neutrinos on the formation and evolution of the first filaments containing the first star - forming halos of mass @xmath0 at @xmath1 . with the help of the extended press - schechter formalism , </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate analytically the rates of merging of the first star - forming halos into zero - dimensional larger halos and one - dimensional first filaments . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that as the neutrino mass fraction @xmath2 increases , the halo - to - filament merging rate increases while the halo - to - halo merging rate decreases sharply . for @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the halo - to - filament merging rate is negligibly low at all filament mass scales , while for @xmath4 the halo - to - filament merging rate exceeds @xmath5 at the characteristic filament mass scale of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the redshifts at which the first filaments ultimately collapse along their longest axes is derived and found to have a sharp maximum at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the formation and evolution of the second generation filaments which contain the first galaxies of mass @xmath8 at @xmath9 as the parent of the first generation filaments . </S>",
    "<S> a similar trend is found : for @xmath4 the rate of clustering of the first galaxies into the second - generation filaments exceeds @xmath10 at the characteristic mass scale of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the longest - axis collapse of these second - generation filaments are found to occur at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of our results on the formation of massive high-@xmath13 galaxies and the early metal enrichment of the intergalactic media by supernova - driven outflows , and possibility of constraining the neutrino mass from the mass distribution of the high-@xmath13 central blackholes are discussed . </S>"
