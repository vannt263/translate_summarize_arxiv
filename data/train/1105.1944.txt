    "in this paper , we explore the motion of a whip , modeled as an inextensible string .",
    "we prove that the partial differential equation describing this motion is locally well - posed in certain weighted sobolev spaces .",
    "in addition , we are interested in the motion of a chain , modeled as a coupled system of @xmath6 pendula , in the limit as @xmath6 approaches infinity .",
    "we show that the motion of the chain converges to that of the whip .",
    "although the equations of motion are well - known and have been studied by many authors , there are few results known about the general existence and uniqueness problem .",
    "reeken  @xcite  @xcite proved local existence and uniqueness for the _ infinite _ string in @xmath7 with gravity and initial data sufficiently close ( in @xmath8 ) to the vertical solution , but aside from this , we know of no other existence result . in the current paper",
    "we prove a local well - posedness theorem for arbitrary initial data for the finite string .",
    "one reason this problem is somewhat complicated is that the equation of motion is hyperbolic , nonlinear , nonlocal , degenerate on a spatial boundary , and possibly even elliptic under certain conditions .",
    "if @xmath9 \\to \\mathbb{r}^d$ ] describes the position @xmath10 of the whip , then one can derive that the equation of motion in the absence of gravity and under the inextensibility constraint @xmath11 is @xmath12 incorporating gravity introduces some complications ; to keep things as simple as possible , we will neglect it .",
    "equation is a standard wave equation ; however , the tension @xmath13 is determined nonlocally , as a consequence of the inextensibility constraint , by the ordinary differential equation @xmath14 with one end fixed and one end free , the boundary conditions are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , along with the compatibility condition @xmath17 .",
    "we use the energy @xmath18 and show that for small time we have local existence and uniqueness in the space for which the energy @xmath19 is bounded .",

    "we prove the following result :    [ theorem1 ] suppose @xmath25\\to \\mathbb{r}^d$ ] and @xmath26\\to \\mathbb{r}^d$ ] are restrictions of functions on @xmath27 $ ] satisfying the oddness condition @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and that they have bounded weighted sobolev norms , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "we prove this by showing that the corresponding discrete energy @xmath38 for the chain with @xmath6 links is uniformly bounded for small time , independently of @xmath6 .",
    "the solution is then a weak- * limit of the chain solutions in @xmath39 , which converges strongly in @xmath40 and hence in @xmath41 .",
    "one could prove this more directly using a galerkin method , but the present technique allows us to simultaneously discuss convergence of the discrete approximation .",
    "all the higher energies @xmath42 can be bounded in terms of @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 initial conditions yield @xmath44 solutions for short time . as a consequence ,",
    "we derive a simple global existence criterion : if the initial conditions are @xmath44 functions , then a @xmath44 solution exists on @xmath45 $ ] if and only if @xmath43 is uniformly bounded on @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "of course , one expects blowup of the whip equation , at least for some initial data , since the whole purpose of a whip is to construct the initial condition so that the velocity of the free end approaches infinity after a short time .",
    "see mcmillen and goriely  @xcite for a discussion of such issues ; although our model neglects some of the phenomena they consider , one expects that the situations are similar in many ways .",
    "for the heuristics of blowup in our situation , see thess et al .",
    "the simplest blowup mechanism appears to be the closing off of a loop along the whip ; as a loop shrinks , there appears a kink in the whip , representing blowup of both the curvature and the angular velocity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ basicequationssection ] , we discuss the equations for the whip and derive the corresponding equations for a chain with @xmath6 links , in terms of difference operators , emphasizing the role of odd and even extensions in order to get the fixed endpoint conditions satisfied automatically . in section [ greenfunctionsection ]",
    "we discuss the solution of the tension equation in terms of a green function , showing that the tension is positive except at @xmath46 and deriving a similar result for the chain .",
    "we also derive sharp upper and lower estimates for the green function . in section [ weightedsobolevsection ]",
    "we explain why we need weighted energies , and we derive the analogues of the sobolev and poincar inequalities for weighted norms , which are used throughout the rest of the paper .    in section [ tensionboundssection ] ,",
    "we give estimates for the tension @xmath13 in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath47 .",
    "for the @xmath48 norms of @xmath13 we use the bounds on the green function ; for higher derivatives we bound the weighted sobolev norms of @xmath13 in terms of those of @xmath34 and @xmath47 .",
    "these bounds are used in section [ energyestimatesection ] to derive the main energy estimate , to bound the time derivative of one energy in terms of another energy .",
    "section [ existenceuniquenesssection ] contains the proof of theorem [ theorem1 ] .",
    "uniqueness is proved using a low - order estimate for the difference of two solutions .",
    "finally in section [ futureresearchsection ] we discuss related open problems . to make the paper a bit easier to read ,",
    "we have moved all of the longer proofs into an appendix .",
    "victor yudovich found several results on this problem , although he did not publish anything on it to my knowledge .",
    "i learned of this problem from alexander shnirelman , and i would like to thank him for many useful discussions about it .",
    "the study of the inextensible string is one of the oldest applications of calculus , going back to galileo , and yet it is still being studied to this day .",
    "one is especially concerned about kinks in the solution and what the appropriate jump conditions should be ; authors such as oreilly and varadi  @xcite , serre  @xcite , and reeken  @xcite have discussed these issues in detail from differing points of view .",
    "the first problem to be studied was finding the shape of a hanging chain , first solved incorrectly by galileo and then correctly by leibniz and bernoulli , one of the first major applications of the calculus of variations .",
    "the shape of small - magnitude vibrations of a chain hanging straight down ( in a linear approximation ) goes back to the bernoullis and euler  @xcite , and is taught in textbooks today as an example of bessel functions ; see johnson  @xcite and schagerl - berger  @xcite for related problems .",
    "kolodner  @xcite , dickey  @xcite , luning - perry  @xcite , and allen - schmidt  @xcite studied the problem of a uniformly rotating inextensible string , one of the few other problems that can be solved more or less exactly .",
    "burchard and thomas  @xcite obtained a local well - posedness result for the related problem of inextensible elastica , in which there is a potential energy term reflecting a resistance to bending ; however it is not clear whether the solutions are preserved in the limit as the potential term goes to zero , so this result does not help in the present situation .",
    "many authors have studied the problem of a vertically folded chain falling from rest ; this is a classical problem that appears in several textbooks ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "the problem has been debated in the physics literature , in particular the issue of whether energy is conserved and whether the tip of the chain falls at an acceleration equal to gravity or faster ( @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "see wong - yasui  @xcite or mcmillen  @xcite for a good survey of the literature .",
    "mcmillen and goriely ( @xcite and @xcite ) studied a tapered whip theoretically , numerically , and experimentally , showing that the crack comes not from the tip but rather from a loop that straightens itself out .",
    "they use a different model , however , in which the tension depends locally on the configuration .",
    "thess et al .",
    "@xcite studied the blowup problem for the closed inextensible string , especially as a model of the blowup problem for the euler equations for a 3d ideal fluid .",
    "they found evidence of blowup from loops closing off , showing numerically that @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the blowup time .",
    "in this section , we present the equations for both whips and chains , assuming no external forces .",
    "our boundary conditions come from the assumption that one end of the whip or chain is held fixed at the origin , while the other end is free .",
    "we describe the whip as a function @xmath52\\times [ 0,1 ] \\to \\mathbb{r}^d$ ] , and describe the chain as a sequence of functions @xmath53\\to \\mathbb{r}^d$ ] for @xmath54 .",
    "our formulas simplify if we assume the fixed point occurs at @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath1 for all @xmath56 ; for the chain , we assume @xmath57 for all @xmath56 .      we will just present the equations here with a sketch of the derivation ; the reader may refer to @xcite for a detailed derivation and discussion .",

    "@xcite also present derivations from minimum principles : the basic idea is to find a critical point of the action @xmath58 subject to the constraint @xmath59 .",
    "a variation @xmath60 must satisfy @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and if @xmath34 is a critical point of the action , then @xmath63 for all such @xmath60 .",
    "integrating by parts , we conclude that a critical @xmath34 must satisfy the evolution equation @xmath64 for some function @xmath13 , where @xmath2 .    differentiating @xmath65 twice with respect to @xmath56",
    ", we find that @xmath13 is determined by the following boundary - value problem for an ordinary differential equation ( for each fixed @xmath56 ) : @xmath66    the boundary conditions are compatible with the evolution equation as long as @xmath34 can be extended to an odd function through @xmath55 ; in that case @xmath13 can be extended to an even function through @xmath55 , which is where we get the extra boundary condition @xmath67",
    ". see figure [ oddcurve ] .",
    "oddness and evenness give us the correct boundary conditions for all higher derivatives of @xmath34 and @xmath13 at @xmath55 , which is crucial for the a priori estimates .",
    "furthermore there is a discrete analogue of oddness and evenness for the chain which both simplifies the equations and helps greatly in defining the higher discrete energies .    , while the fixed end is at @xmath55 .",
    "we imagine the curve extending smoothly through the origin to @xmath68 through an odd reflection such that @xmath69 .",
    "under such an extension , the tension extends to a smooth function satisfying @xmath70 . ]",
    "a sometimes simpler way of dealing with the constraint @xmath71 is to consider @xmath72 as a curve on the unit sphere in @xmath73 .",
    "for simplicity we will assume @xmath74 when doing this , although the technique works in spherical coordinates in any dimension .",
    "we write @xmath75 a straightforward computation verifies that becomes @xmath76 while becomes @xmath77 the fact that @xmath34 is odd through @xmath55 forces us to have @xmath78 even through @xmath55 , so the boundary condition on is @xmath79 .",
    "we could work out all the estimates directly in terms of the system  , but the discrete versions of these equations are substantially more complicated than the discrete versions of  , even when @xmath74 .    if @xmath80 is strictly positive for @xmath81 ,",
    "then equation is a hyperbolic equation with a parabolic degeneracy at @xmath46 ( since we must have @xmath2 ) . as such ,",
    "the only condition necessary to impose at @xmath46 is that @xmath82 remain finite .",
    "we point out that equation can not be an ordinary differential equation on any infinite - dimensional sobolev manifold : the right side is obviously an unbounded operator even in the simplest case .",
    "hence we can not hope to prove existence and uniqueness using the techniques of picard iteration on an infinite - dimensional space , as in ebin - marsden  @xcite .",
    "instead we will work directly with the partial differential equation using energy estimates .",
    "we now derive the equations for the finite model , consisting of @xmath83 particles in @xmath84 , each of mass @xmath85 , one of which is held fixed .",
    "the particles are assumed to be joined by rigid links of length @xmath85 , whose mass is negligible .",
    "the position of the @xmath86 particle is @xmath87 for @xmath54 ; we assume the fixed end is the @xmath88 particle , so that @xmath89 for all time . , but our choice makes the tensions @xmath90 proportional to @xmath91 rather than @xmath92 , simplifying some formulas . ] the configuration space is thus homeomorphic to @xmath93 , and is naturally embedded in @xmath94 .",
    "the kinetic energy in @xmath94 is @xmath95 in addition the constraints are given by @xmath96 stationary points of the constrained action satisfy the equations of motion @xmath97 for some lagrange multipliers @xmath98 .",
    "more explicitly , we have @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "the scaling by @xmath101 is chosen so that @xmath102 converges to a function @xmath80 as @xmath103 .",
    "the numbers @xmath13 physically represent the tensions in each link .",
    "we set @xmath104 so the same equation is valid when @xmath105 .",
    "the constraint equations determine the @xmath13 .",
    "differentiating twice with respect to time and using , we get @xmath106 for @xmath107 ( again using @xmath104 ) , while for @xmath108 we get ( using @xmath109 ) @xmath110    we note that if @xmath111 where @xmath112\\to\\mathbb{r}^d$ ] and @xmath113\\to\\mathbb{r}$ ] are @xmath44 , then as @xmath114 , the formal limit of is and the formal limit of is .",
    "( note that this discretization of @xmath34 ensures that @xmath115 for all @xmath116 , since @xmath117 for all @xmath118 .",
    "we will refine this in section [ interpolation ] . )",
    "if @xmath119 and @xmath2 , then this choice also gives @xmath120 and @xmath121 , as desired .",
    "hence the chain equations and form a discretization of the whip equations and which conserves energy as well as preserving the geometry .",
    "the analysis of the chain equations becomes much simpler if we can avoid using separate equations for the boundary terms . an easy way to do",
    "this is to extend @xmath122 and @xmath90 beyond @xmath108 by demanding that @xmath34 be odd through @xmath123 and that @xmath13 be even , which is exactly what we had to do for the whip in section [ whipsection ] .",
    "so for @xmath124 we set @xmath125 then it is easy to see that the evolution equation still holds for the fixed point at @xmath123 and that for @xmath108 yields the tension boundary condition .",
    "a further simplification comes from using difference operators .",
    "( see for example @xcite . )",
    "first recall that for a sequence @xmath126 defined on some subset of @xmath127 , the ( forward ) shift operator @xmath128 is given by @xmath129 .",
    "the backward shift is denoted by @xmath130 , so that @xmath131 , and powers of @xmath128 signify composition .",
    "we define the ( forward ) difference operator @xmath132 by @xmath133,\\ ] ] so that if @xmath134 denotes the identity operator , then @xmath135 .",
    "it is also sometimes convenient to work with the backward difference operator @xmath136 , defined by @xmath137 $ ] , so that @xmath138 . in this notation for the forward difference and @xmath139 for the backward difference ; we use @xmath132 and @xmath136 instead to avoid confusion with the laplacian on smooth functions , and since our rescaled version is not standard .",
    "we prefer the rescaling since if the sequence @xmath140 converges to a smooth function @xmath141 as @xmath114 , then @xmath142 converges to @xmath143 . ] equations and become @xmath144 where the equations are valid when any subscript @xmath145 is placed on all the terms simultaneously .",
    "we can thus write all the discrete equations without specific reference to subscripts , which simplifies the notation .",
    "the following formulas will be useful when working with difference operators and sums : both follow from the simplest product formula @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147    we can rewrite in a more useful form , solving for the second difference @xmath148 in terms of everything else , using @xmath149 to simplify the terms .",
    "we obtain @xmath150 and the resemblance to the continuous version is obvious .",
    "at each fixed time , equation is a linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equation for the tension @xmath13 .",
    "hence there is a green function @xmath151 depending on @xmath152 , such that @xmath153 similarly , equation can be thought of as a linear nonhomogeneous matrix equation for @xmath13 , for which the solution takes the analogous form @xmath154 for some `` discrete green function '' @xmath155 .",
    "naturally we expect that if @xmath156 and @xmath157 , then @xmath158 as @xmath114 ; this can be proved as a consequence of our general convergence result for @xmath34 .",
    "our goal in this section is to establish properties of these green functions .",
    "in particular we establish that the green function is always nonnegative for a whip in a sufficiently smooth configuration , while the green function is nonnegative for a chain as long as all the angles between links are obtuse .",
    "furthermore we want to establish upper and lower bounds for the ratios @xmath159 and @xmath160 , where @xmath161 , in order to be able to compare the norms weighted by powers of @xmath80 to the norms weighted by powers of @xmath162 .",

    "it satisfies @xmath168 whenever @xmath169 and @xmath81 .",
    "in addition if @xmath170 , we have @xmath171 for @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "the existence of the green function and the symmetry property @xmath167 is a well - known result of the general theory for second - order equations with homogeneous boundary conditions .",
    "see for example courant - hilbert  @xcite .    to prove the other statements ,",
    "we first show that @xmath175 for any @xmath176 . for any fixed @xmath177 , multiplying by @xmath178 , integrating from @xmath46 to @xmath55 , and using integration by parts with the homogeneous boundary conditions",
    "shows that @xmath179 which forces @xmath180 .",
    "because of the jump condition @xmath181 we can not have @xmath182 identically zero if @xmath170 .",
    "so @xmath183 if @xmath170 .",
    "it is then easy to prove the other statements in the intervals @xmath184 and @xmath185 using the boundary conditions .",
    "now let us do the same for the tension operator for the chain .",
    "the equation , or the more elegant version , makes clear that the vector @xmath186 of tensions comes from inverting a tridiagonal matrix .",
    "since this is one of the easiest matrix types to invert , we get a relatively explicit formula for the solution , which will be useful in constructing estimates on the maximum and minimum tension .",
