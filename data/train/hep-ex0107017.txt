    "the @xmath2 collider hera , which provides both baryonic ( @xmath3 ) and leptonic ( @xmath4 ) quantum numbers in the initial state , is ideally suited to search for new particles possessing couplings to a lepton - quark pair .",
    "such particles could be leptoquarks ( lqs ) or scalar quarks ( squarks , @xmath5 ) .",
    "lqs are color - triplet bosons which appear in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "squarks , the scalar supersymmetric ( susy ) partners of quarks , also couple to a lepton - quark pair in models which violate @xmath6-parity .",
    "the @xmath6-parity , defined as @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being respectively the fermion number and the spin , is a discrete symmetry .",
    "hera also provides ideal conditions to look for excited fermions ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) of the first generation .",
    "the existence of these excited states would provide clear evidence for fermion substructure .",
    "this note briefly reviews all recent searches at hera based on three independent data samples taken since 1994 .",
    "the most recently published results were obtained using data collected from 1994 to 1997 at a center - of - mass energy @xmath13 of 300gev by colliding _",
    "positrons _ of energy 27.5gev with protons of 820gev . the results from 1998 - 1999 _ electron_-proton collisions at a slightly higher energy @xmath14gev ( due to an increase of the proton beam energy to 920gev ) are mostly still in their preliminary form .",
    "the new @xmath15 data taken in 1999 - 2000 at @xmath16gev are being analyzed and first results are presented here .",
    "the searches for lqs and squarks in @xmath0-violating ( @xmath1 ) susy are presented , respectively , in secs.[sec : lq ] and [ sec : susy ] .",
    "sec.[sec : exfermion ] describes the searches for excited fermions , followed by sec.[sec : summary ] with a summary and an outlook .",
    "at hera , lqs could be resonantly produced in the @xmath17-channel by the fusion of the initial state lepton with a quark from the proton or virtually exchanged in the @xmath18-channel .",
    "lqs can decay to @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that the amplitudes of the @xmath17- and @xmath18-channel diagrams interfere with those from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes of the neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) interactions .    in general ,",
    "the @xmath17-channel contribution dominates for lq masses up to @xmath21 .",
    "the production cross - section can be written to , a good approximation , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and 1 respectively for scalar and vector lqs , @xmath24 is the yukawa coupling at the lq-@xmath25-@xmath26 vertex , and @xmath27 is the parton density .",
    "the @xmath18-channel and interference contributions can not produce a resonance peak and are only important for @xmath28 .    the phenomenological model proposed by buchmller - rckl - wyler ( brw )  @xcite describes 14 lqs , of which 7 have @xmath29 and 7 have @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath15 collisions provide the best sensitivity to the former since the fusion involves a quark instead of an antiquark .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath31 collisions where the @xmath30 states are best probed .",
    "the final states of lq decay are identical to nc and cc dis processes . on the other hand ,",
    "since the angular distributions of the decay products of a scalar or vector resonance are different from those of dis ( in particular for nc ) , a mass dependent angular cut , or equivalently a cut in @xmath32 , is applied to maximize the signal significance .",
    "an excess of events was originally observed in the mass and @xmath33 distributions of the nc channel in the 1994 - 1996 @xmath15 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 15pb@xmath34 per experiment .",
    "however such an excess was not confirmed by later higher statistics samples of @xmath15 data ( @xmath35pb@xmath34 in 1997 and @xmath36pb@xmath34 in 1999 - 2000 ) and by the @xmath31 data ( @xmath37pb@xmath34 ) .    since no evidence for lq production",
    "was observed , upper limits were derived on the lq cross - section and coupling @xmath24 . as an example ,",
    "upper limits at 95% confidence level ( cl ) obtained for a lq state @xmath38 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqe+ ] .",
    "0.5 cm    ( 50,140 ) ( -120,-50 )    the h1 direct limit  @xcite for masses below 300gev was derived from the 1994 - 1997 @xmath15 data . by taking properly into account the @xmath18-channel and interference contributions ,",
    "a sensitivity to coupling values @xmath39 was established for masses up to 400gev .",
    "the better sensitivity at higher masses was achieved by a contact interaction analysis  @xcite where part of the 1999 - 2000 @xmath15 data was combined with those of 1994 - 1997 .",
    "the preliminary zeus limit , presented for the first time in this workshop , was obtained using the full @xmath15 data .",
    "the higher sensitivity at @xmath40gev is largely due to the increased @xmath21 . in comparison with limits from lep  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite ,",
    "hera thus provides the best sensitivity at the intermediate and high mass range . in generic lq models ,",
    "the branching ratios of lq decays in the nc and cc dis -like modes are free parameters in contrast to the brw model where they are fixed to 1 , 1/2 , or 0 .",
    "if the lq decays into @xmath19 and @xmath20 only , the combined preliminary h1 results obtained from the 1998 - 1999 @xmath31 data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqe- ] .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed by zeus using the 1994 - 1997 @xmath15 data  @xcite .",
    "the combined bounds are largely independent of the individual branching ratios .",
    "as soon as @xmath24 exceeds @xmath41 , these limits extend considerably beyond the region excluded by d0 , as represented by the shaded domain .",
    "( 50,145 ) ( -120,-45 ) ( -70,-34 )",
    "susy is one of the most likely ingredients for a theory beyond the sm . in particular , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )",
    "describes all experimental data just as well as the sm .",
    "the most general susy theory which preserves gauge invariance of the sm allows for @xmath1 yukawa couplings @xmath24 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 between one squark or slepton and two sm fermions : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 are generation indices , @xmath46 are the left - handed lepton ( quark ) doublet superfields and @xmath47 are the right - handed electron ( down and up quark ) singlet superfields",
    ". of particular interest for hera are the @xmath1 terms @xmath48 .",
    "the squarks at hera are thus singly produced in the @xmath17-channel with masses up to the kinematic limit .    in the case where both production and decay occur through the same @xmath49 ,",
    "the squarks in @xmath1-susy behave as scalar lqs and the constraints obtained on lqs are also applicable for squarks .",
    "there are however other decay modes in which a squark decays to a quark and a gaugino ( chargino or neutralino ) with @xmath0-conserving gauge couplings . because of the gauge decay modes , the resulting constraints on the mass and coupling of squarks depend on the various parameters in the susy phase space .",
    "the search sensitivity is improved considerably when the gauge decay modes are combined with those of @xmath50 decays .    with @xmath15 collisions ,",
    "hera is most sensitive to the couplings @xmath51 amongst the nine possible couplings @xmath49 , where mainly @xmath52 squarks are produced via processes involving a valence @xmath53 quark data are well suited to probe couplings @xmath54 and @xmath55 squarks . ] .",
    "mass dependent limits  @xcite on @xmath56 were derived by both h1 and zeus within the mssm model and by h1 within the minimal supergravity model , a more constrained susy model .",
    "the model dependence of the results was studied in detail by performing a scan of the mssm parameters and was found to be small .",
    "the hera direct searches improve the best indirect limits on @xmath57 from atomic parity violation measurements by a factor of up to 3 . in a large part of the mssm parameter space covered by the scan ,",
    "the existence of squarks coupling to a @xmath58 pair with masses up to 260gev is excluded at 95% cl for a coupling of electromagnetic strength .",
    "at hera , excited fermions ( @xmath59 ) could be singly produced via the @xmath60-channel exchange of a gauge boson , and would subsequently decay into a sm fermion and a boson .",
    "collider searches are generally interpreted in the framework of the phenomenological model  @xcite , where the interactions of @xmath59 with a sm fermion and an electroweak boson ( a gluon ) , @xmath61@xmath62 @xmath63f_l+h.c.$ ] , are parameterized via the compositeness scale @xmath64 and relative couplings @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the search has investigated the decays of @xmath59 into @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , followed by the subsequent decay of the boson into @xmath25 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or hadrons .",
    "no deviation from the sm predictions has been observed , which leads to constraints on the considered model .",
    "based on the 1994 - 1997 @xmath15 data at @xmath73gev , upper limits for @xmath74 ( with @xmath75 ) was not considered since the production cross - section of the @xmath10 would be very small due to the vanishing coupling constant . ] ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 were obtained for an @xmath10 mass ranging from 50gev to 250gev . for an @xmath11 mass ranging from 50 to 200gev , the values of the limits for @xmath74 ( with @xmath78 )",
    "vary between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the limits when @xmath75 were less stringent due to the absence of the dominant decay @xmath81 .",
    "assuming @xmath82 , masses below 223 and 114gev are excluded at 95% cl , respectively , for the @xmath83 and @xmath84 production .",
    "these limits extend beyond those obtained at lep where the constraints are limited either to beam energies for @xmath85 produced in pairs or to the center - of - mass energies for @xmath85 produced singly .",
    "limits for the @xmath12 on @xmath74 assuming @xmath75 and @xmath86 ( i.e. only electroweak couplings ) vary between @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath12 masses ranging from 50 to 250gev .",
    "the hera limits are complementary to those from the tevatron where stringent bounds were set on @xmath12 produced in @xmath89 fusion via the coupling @xmath67 .    using the 1998 - 1999 @xmath31 data , preliminary limits  @xcite on @xmath74 for @xmath11",
    "have been obtained by both hera experiments , which improve significantly the limit based on the @xmath15 data , e.g.  by h1 from 114gev to 150gev for @xmath78 , due to the much higher production cross - section .",
    "new particle production of leptoquarks , scalar quarks , and excited fermions has been extensively searched for at hera .",
    "many final results based on the 1994 - 1997 @xmath15 data were published .",
    "some preliminary results using the 1998 - 1999 @xmath31 are available , which either complement the searches for new particle types ( e.g.  @xmath30 versus @xmath29 lqs probed respectively with @xmath31 and @xmath15 data ) or extend substantially the limits ( e.g.  for @xmath11 ) .",
    "higher sensitivity has been obtained using the 1999 - 2000 @xmath15 data on the yukawa coupling of the lq and such an improvement is also expected for searches for squarks and excited fermions .",
    "hera limits were found to be competitive and complementary in comparison with those from other high energy machines and low energy experiments .    the hera machine and both the h1 and zeus detectors are being upgraded .",
    "a factor of about 5 increase in the luminosity and the improved detectors after the upgrade will provide new particle hunters with new and exciting opportunities in the next years before the era of the lhc ."
