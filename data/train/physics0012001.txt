    "@xcite , in _ helium _",
    "@xcite , and in _",
    "lithium_-like uranium  @xcite and bismuth  @xcite .",
    "the current status of many precision tests of quantum - electrodynamics in hydrogen and helium can be found in this edition .",
    "furthermore , highly - charged ions possess electrons that move with a velocity which is close to the speed of light .",
    "the theoretical study of such systems must therefore take into account _ relativity _ ; moreover , a _ perturbative _ treatment of the binding to the _ nucleus _ ( with coupling constant @xmath0 ) fails in this situation  @xcite .",
    "perturbative expansions in @xmath0 , however , are useful in different situations ( see @xcite for a review , and articles in _ this edition _",
    "there are only a few number of methods that can be used in order to predict energy levels for _ highly - charged ions _ within the framework of bound - state quantum electrodynamics  @xcite : the adiabatic @xmath1-matrix formalism of gell - mann , low and sucher  @xcite , the evolution operator method  @xcite , the two - time green s function method  @xcite and an interesting method recently proposed by lindgren ( based on relativistic many - body perturbation theory merged with qed )  @xcite .",
    "all these methods are based on a study of the some evolution operator or propagator ; the two extreme times of the propagation can be _ both infinite _ ( gell - mann  low  sucher ) , _ one _ can be finite and the other infinite ( lindgren ) , and both can be finite ( shabaev ) .",
    "but among these methods , only _ two _ can in principle be used in order to apply perturbation theory to _ quasi - degenerate _ levels ( e.g. , the @xmath2p@xmath3 and @xmath4p@xmath3 levels in helium - like ions ) : the two - time green s function method and lindgren s method ( which is still under development ) .",
    "both work by constructing a finite - sized _ effective hamiltonian _ whose eigenvalues give the energy levels  @xcite .",
    "the two - time green s function method has the advantage of being applicable to many atomic physics problems , such as the recombination of an electron with an ion  @xcite , the shape of spectral lines  @xcite and the effect of nuclear recoil on atomic energy levels  @xcite .",
    "we give in this section a short outline of the two - time green s function method .",
    "the basic object of this method  @xcite represents the probability amplitude for @xmath5 fermions to go from one position to the other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : greendef ] .",
    "the corresponding mathematical object is a usual @xmath5-particle correlation function between _ two _ times : @xmath6 where  @xmath7 is the vacuum of the _ full _ bound - state qed hamiltonian  @xmath8 , and where the quantum field  @xmath9 is defined as the usual canonical electron  positron field evolving under the total hamiltonian in the _ heisenberg _ picture  @xcite .",
    "a remark can be made here about _",
    "lorentz invariance _ : the above correlation function ( or propagator ) displays only _ two times _ , which are associated to _ many different positions_. a lorentz transform of the space  time positions involved therefore yields many different individual times ( one for each position ) ; thus , the object ( [ 51eq : fullfprop ] ) must be defined in a _",
    "specific _ reference frame . and this reference frame is chosen as nothing more than the galilean reference frame associated to the nucleus , which is physically privileged .",
    "the @xmath5-particle green s function is a function of _ energy _ simply defined through a fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defproptime ] ) : @xmath10 this function is interesting because it contains the energy levels predicted by bound - state qed : one can show  @xcite that @xmath11 where @xmath7 is the vacuum of the total hamiltonian @xmath8 ; @xmath12 is the usual second - quantized dirac field in the schrdinger representation and @xmath13 is the energy of the eigenstate @xmath14 of @xmath8 .",
    "the poles in @xmath15 with a positive real part are exactly the energies of the states with charge @xmath16 , which are physically the atomic eigenstates of an ion with @xmath5 orbiting electrons ( the charge of the nucleus is not counted in the total charge . ) , as shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : polesgreen ] .",
    "such a result is similar to the so - called klln  lehmann representation  @xcite .    in order to obtain the energy levels contained in ( [ 51eq : greenzerothorder ] ) , we must resort on a perturbative calculation of the correlation function ( [ 51eq : fullfprop ] ) , which belongs to standard textbook knowledge  @xcite .",
    "the position of the _ poles _ of ( [ 51eq : greenzerothorder ] ) must then be mathematically found .",
    "it is possible to construct an effective , finite - size hamiltonian which acts on the atomic state that one is interested in ; the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian then give the bound - state qed evaluation of the energy levels  @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian is obtained through contour integrations .",
    "the current state - of - the - art in non - perturbative calculations ( in @xmath0 ) of atomic energy levels within bound - state qed consists in the theoretical evaluation of the contribution of diagrams with _ two photons _",
    "( i.e. of order @xmath17 , since the electron ",
    "photon coupling constant is @xmath18 ) .",
    "for instance , for ions with two electrons , the screening of one electron by the other is described by the six diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagsscndorder ] .    however , most of the calculations of contributions of order @xmath17 were , until very recently , restricted to the very specific case of the ground - state ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "the extension to the calculation of the energy levels of quasi - degenerate states represents one of the current trends of the research in the domain of non - perturbative ( in @xmath0 ) calculations with qed .",
    "we have calculated the contribution of the screened self - energy ( first and fourth diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagsscndorder ] ) to some isolated levels in @xcite .",
    "when energy levels are quasi - degenerate ( e.g. , the @xmath2p@xmath3 and @xmath4p@xmath3 levels in helium - like ions ) , the two - time green s function method allows one to evaluate the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian between different states ; for the first diagram of fig .",

    "( they contribute to higher orders , as can be seen in the particular case of two levels  @xcite . )",
