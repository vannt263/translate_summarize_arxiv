    "experimental discovery of lorentz violation could provide evidence of a unified theory of general relativity and the standard model at the planck scale.@xcite the standard - model extension ( sme ) provides a comprehensive effective field - theory based framework in which to search for lorentz violation at accessible energies,@xcite and a large number of searches have been performed in the sme context.@xcite ring - laser systems have the potential to provide another interesting test of lorentz symmetry in the gravity sector of the sme.@xcite this section briefly summarizes some basic information about ring lasers and about the gravity sector of the sme prior to the discussion of our analysis and results in sec .

    "ring lasers consist of two light beams traveling in opposite directions along a closed path .",
    "effects that break the symmetry of the system are encoded in the interference of these beams .",
    "the largest such effect routinely observed is that of rotating - frame effects on the system known as the sagnac effect , which generates a laser beat frequency of @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the area and perimeter of the ring respectively , @xmath3 is the wavelength of the light , and @xmath4 is a unit normal to the ring . in this way ,",
    "ring lasers are able to measure their own rotation @xmath5 .",
    "a fixed ring laser located on the earth will experience several effects that alter the beat frequency .",
    "these include the rotation of the earth , and thus the ring - laser system , and frame dragging effects predicted by general relativity . for a planar loop in the equatorial plane ,",
    "the gravitomagnetic effects of earth s angular momentum , @xmath6 , take the following form ( in natural units),@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radius of the earth , and @xmath9 is newton s constant .    since lorentz violation is known to mimic gravitomagnetic effects,@xcite we consider its impact on ring - laser experiments here .",
    "solving the linearized effective einstein equations for the pure - gravity sector of the minimal sme , the following post - newtonian metric is obtained,@xcite @xmath10 which forms the starting point for the current analysis . here",
    "@xmath11 is a coefficient for lorentz violation in the minimal gravity sector .",
    "the standard newtonian potential is given by @xmath12 , and the remaining potentials are defined as @xmath13 and @xmath14.@xcite though it lies beyond our present scope , we note in passing that a similar analysis for the matter sector may also be of interest.@xcite",
    "here we consider lorentz - violating effects stemming from eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) that generate signals in ring - laser experiments in the absence of sagnac or gravitomagnetic effects , as opposed to those that can arise as a perturbation on these effects . while it is clear that perturbations on the conventional effects also exist ,",
    "resulting signals are typically suppressed .",
    "working to leading order in lorentz violation , we derive the beat frequency in analogy with gravitomagnetism by calculating the time of flight difference between the two beams due to @xmath15 via an integral along the light - like world lines of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) .    in this proceedings contribution",
    ", we consider a sample ring - laser system as an illustration of the results that arise .",
    "for the sample system , we consider an approximately rectangular loop in the equatorial plane for which two sides are radial and two sides are azimuthal .",
    "for the radial legs of the path , which provide the signal of interest , the world line takes the following form : @xmath16 solving for the beat frequency under these conditions yields @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the newtonian gravitational field and capital indices @xmath19 denote components in the standard sun - centered frame.@xcite note that on the surface of the earth , @xmath20 .",
    "hence the observable beat frequency varies sidereally in the presence of lorentz violation . using the previously described method , it is possible to generate the resulting dominant contributions to the beat frequency for a ring laser in any orientation.@xcite",
    "the ginger ( gyroscopes in general relativity ) experiment will consist of several perpendicular ring lasers and is currently being designed with the sensitivity to measure the gravitomagnetic effects of general relativity.@xcite the experiment expects to obtain sensitivity to the angular velocity of the earth via the sagnac effect beyond the part in @xmath21 level.@xcite using this experimental sensitivity and the sample system above , it is possible to generate a crude estimate of the sensitivity to lorentz violation that might be achieved by the ginger project .",
    "we predict that sensitivities to @xmath22 better than parts in @xmath23 are possible . with the exception of astrophysical tests,@xcite which perhaps involve additional assumptions , sensitivities at this level",
    "would be competitive with the current state of the art measurements.@xcite"
