    "electromagnetic radiation from an uncharged spin @xmath0 particle with an anomalous magnetic moment moving in certain types of classical electromagnetic field was studied previously within the furry picture of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "meanwhile it was observed that under certain conditions the radiation process may be described in purely classical terms using the bargmann ",
    " telegdi ( bmt ) spin evolution equation @xcite .",
    "in such a pseudoclassical treatment the radiation power is given by the well - known formula for a magnetic moment radiation @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the 4-vector of the magnetic moment and @xmath3 is the 4-velocity of the particle . here",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the unit vector in the direction of an emitted wave ; a dot denotes the differentiation with respect to the proper time @xmath6 .",
    "we use the units @xmath7 .",
    "the radiation power calculated within the framework of qed is found to correspond to the result obtained from equation ( [ 1 ] ) under the conditions of quasi - classical character of the motion , namely , that the binding energy due to the magnetic moment in the rest frame should be much smaller than the particle mass , and the external field should vary slowly at the distances of the order of the compton length , which amounts to the conditions : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the magnetic field strength in the rest frame and @xmath10 is the value of particle magnetic moment ( here we use gaussian units ) .    in our papers",
    "@xcite radiation of unpolarized neutral particles was investigated in quasi - classical approach in the case of arbitrary field . to study radiation from an unpolarized particle one",
    "must impose an additional requirement that consists in averaging over the initial spin states and summing over the final polarizations .",
    "the averaging of the quantum transition amplitudes should correspond to the averaging over the initial orientations of the magnetic dipole moment within the quasi - classical consideration .",
    "we proposed @xcite to replace the magnetic moment by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean value of the spin vector , its evolution being described by the bmt equation @xcite : @xmath13 the validity of this equation is ensured by the conditions ( [ 2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "our main goal was to show that when the averaging over polarization states at @xmath14 is performed , the resulting expression for the radiation power depends only on the external field intensity and thus is valid in the case of arbitrary external field subjected to the conditions ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "it is important that the neutral particle moves with a constant velocity in the external field . of course , the true quantum description of radiation demands the accounting of quantum recoil in the photon emission process .",
    "but when conditions ( [ 2 ] ) are satisfied , the energies of emitted photons are small , therefore we can neglect the change of the particle velocity .",
    "unfortunately , while studying radiation of polarized particles , even with the assumptions similar to ones discussed above , the approach based on formula ( [ 1 ] ) is valid only for the transitions without spin - flip .",
    "so here we will use another method @xcite based on the introduction of quasi - classical spin wave functions in qed formulas .",
    "such wave functions can be constructed as follows @xcite .",
    "suppose the lorentz equation is solved , i.e. the dependence of coordinates of the particle on proper time is found .",
    "then bmt equation transforms to ordinary differential equation , resolvent of which determines a one - parametric subgroup of the lorentz group .",
    "the quasi - classical spin wave function signifies a spin - tensor , whose evolution is determined by the same one - parametric subgroup .",
    "it is easy to verify that for a neutral particle with spin @xmath15 represented by a dirac bispinor , the equation for the wave function @xmath16 under consideration is @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dual electromagnetic tensor .",
    "obviously , the density matrix of partially polarized fermion takes the form @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the resolvent of equation ( [ ar9 ] ) . for a pure state",
    "the density matrix reduces to direct product of bispinors , normalized by the condition @xmath21",
    "now let us investigate the radiation of polarized particles on the base of the above considerations .",

    "the latter operation implies inserting the following expression : @xmath29 in the integrand of ( [ ar1 ] ) , which reduces the integration to the particle trajectory .",
    "after summation over photon polarizations and integration with respect to fermion momenta and coordinates , we obtain the quasi - classical expressions for the transition probability under investigation : @xmath30 and for the radiation energy @xmath31 here the following notation is introduced : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are determined by formulas : @xmath34 \\displaystyle   v_{f}= \\frac{1}{4}{\\mathrm { sp}}\\!\\left\\ { \\hat{l}\\,u(\\tau')(1+\\hat{u } )    ( 1\\!-\\gamma^{5}{\\hat{s}}_{0f})u^{-1}(\\tau)\\right\\}\\!,\\\\[12pt ] \\displaystyle a_{i}=\\frac{1}{4}{\\mathrm { sp}}\\big\\{\\!\\gamma^{5 } \\hat{l}\\,u(\\tau)(1+\\hat{u } )    ( 1\\!-\\gamma^{5}{\\hat{s}}_{0i})u^{-1}(\\tau')\\big\\},\\\\[12pt ] \\displaystyle a_{f}=\\frac{1}{4}{\\mathrm { sp}}\\big\\{\\!\\gamma^{5 } \\hat{l}\\,u(\\tau')(1+\\hat{u } )    ( 1\\!-\\gamma^{5}{\\hat{s}}_{0f})u^{-1}(\\tau)\\big\\}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] in formulas ( [ ar5 ] ) and ( [ ar6 ] ) the operator @xmath35 is the resolvent of the equation ( [ ar9 ] ) .",

    "it should be emphasized that the results obtained in this section agree in the quasi - classical region with those obtained by the methods of quantum electrodynamics in the cases when such calculations were carried out @xcite .",

    "the radiation powers of a charged particle and that of a neutral particle have the same orders of magnitude either in superstrong fields , which can exist in the vicinity of astrophysical objects of pulsar type , or in very high - frequency fields .",
    "two important conclusions follow from the obtained results . first of all",
    ", neutral particles can emit radiation without spin flip .",
    "this possibility depends on the following circumstance .",
    "particle polarization is well defined in the rest frame . to determine polarization in the laboratory frame it is necessary to make lorentz transformation along the kinetic momentum of the particle . however , for the particle in an external field , directions of kinetic and canonical momenta , generally speaking , are different .",
    "that is why radiative transitions without spin flip do not contradict conservation laws .",
    "therefore commonly used description of radiative transitions of neutral particles as transitions with spin flip is perfectly true only when transitions from the state which is opposite to the total self - polarization state are considered .    as a result of radiative transition",
    ", the particle always goes to the state with the spin parallel to the self - polarization axis .",
    "so even for the process in homogeneous magnetic field , the transition probability divides into transition probabilities with and without spin flip .",
    "when the particle moves in inhomogeneous , or especially in non - stationary electromagnetic field , the radiative transition without spin flip occurs even from the total self - polarization state .",
    "for example , this effect is inherent in the process in the plane - wave field . in this case",
    "the particle taken in the state of total polarization emits radiation with the frequency of the external wave ( i. e. it scatters the external wave ) .    in the second place , there are configurations of external fields for which total polarization states of the particles do not exist .",
    "the example of such configuration is the redmond field .",
