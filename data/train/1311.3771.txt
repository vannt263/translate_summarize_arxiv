    "average central densities , nuclear radius of surface diffuseness are basic quantities characterizing finite nuclear systems .",

    "some of the important information inferred from the nuclear density profile : the almost constant central densities seen in nuclei gives a direct inside in the incompressible nature of nuclear matter ; extensive discussion are made currently on the difference between proton - neutron nuclear radius to study the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "such considerations are usually restricted to spherical nuclei .",
    "most of nuclei however are found to be deformed in their ground states especially in the medium- and heavy - mass regions @xcite .",
    "the present work is an attempt to identify some peculiar effects that might show up in deformed systems .",
    "the energy density functional ( edf ) based on skyrme effective interaction is a suitable tool for such a study . indeed , following the same philosophy as the density functional theory in electronic systems , the nuclear energy density functional theory is optimized to provide an adequate approximation for the total energy and the nuclear local density .",
    "the edf is commonly used nowadays to study the onset of deformation @xcite . here",
    ", we make a large - scale analysis of the nuclear density profiles along the whole nuclear chart .",
    "a particular attention is made to study the diffuseness of the surface which have an important influence for the calculation of deformation @xcite as well as for the calculation of the fusion barrier @xcite .",
    "while the central density and radius can be understood with rather simple arguments , properties of the nuclear surface diffuseness turns out to be more complicated than anticipated .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next chapter , the methodology to characterize nuclear shapes and density profiles is exposed .",
    "section iii provides a detailed analysis of the density profile uncovering the quasi - systematic polarization of the nuclear surface . in section iv ,",
    "an example of consequences on nuclear dynamics is given .",
    "the nuclear density obtained with the _ ev8 _ code @xcite was investigated over 749 even - even nuclei ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 whose experimental masses are known .",
    "the _ ev8 _ code solves the hf+bcs in r - space with the skyrme functional in the mean - field term and with a contact interaction in the pairing channel . here",
    "a surface type pairing interaction is used with the same strength as in the ref .",

    "the mesh size has been taken as @xmath4 fm and the total size of the mesh are @xmath5 fm .",
    "we have checked that enlarging the mesh size does not affect the results presented below .",
    "two different functionals , namely the sly4 @xcite and the skm * @xcite have been employed in the mean - field channel .",
    "the specific symmetries imposed in the _ ev8 _ program only allow for even multipole deformation : quadrupole , hexadecapole , etc . the number of nuclei that are found spherical , oblate , prolate , or triaxial with the skm * functional are respectively @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "( [ eq : rr ] ) the volume conservation is taken into account in @xmath18 .",
    "the parametrization that should be taken for the diffuseness parameter is less clear . in particular",
    ", there is a subtle aspect related to the fact that @xmath19 corresponds to the diffuseness along the radial axis , that is different from the diffuseness perpendicular to the @xmath20 isodensity surface .",

    "this has been briefly discussed in sect .",
    "@xcite . in this case , assuming that @xmath25 , the leading correction to the radial diffuseness is given by : @xmath26 such parametrization has two major drawbacks .",
    "first , it is only valid at small deformation , which is not always the case for the considered nuclei .",
