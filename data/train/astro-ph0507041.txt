    "x - ray observations are the most sensitive tool available for the study of massive star end products , both stellar and interstellar .",
    "ic  10 is our nearest laboratory for such a study in a dwarf starburst galaxy .",
    "this galaxy is particularly known for its large number of wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars ; the global surface density , @xmath8 w - r kpc@xmath9 over an area of @xmath10 , is about 20 times higher than in the large magellanic cloud ( richer et al .",
    "2001 ; massey & holmes 2002 ) .",
    "this large population of w - r stars is very unusual for the low metallicity of ( @xmath11 solar ; e.g. , lequeux et al .",
    "1979 ; crowther et al .",
    "the galaxy also contains a number of energetic interstellar shells ; their origins are , however , unclear ( e.g. , wilcots & miller 1998 ; yang & skillman 1993 ) .",
    "the presence of an enigmatic radio emission shell of diameter @xmath12  pc around the brightest x - ray source  x-1 is particularly interesting @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is predominantly nonthermal , as indicated by its steep spectrum .",
    "the required presence of an extremely powerful source of relativistic particles is _ not _ expected for a typical shell - like supernova remnant on such a large scale or for a young superbubble produced by an ob association , which would generate overwhelming amounts of ionizing radiation .",
    "indeed , the shell shows only weak h@xmath13 ( or thermal ) emission @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the nonthermal radio shell may be powered by  x-1 , similar to the link between the galactic x - ray binary ss  433 and its surrounding nonthermal structure w50 ( diameter @xmath14 pc ) , albeit on greater physical and energetic scales @xcite .",
    "x-1 is the focus of the previous x - ray studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they find that the source is spatially coincident with the w - r star [ mac92 ] 17a in  ( massey , armanroff , & conti 1992 ) and speculate that the accreting compact object is a black hole ( bh ) based on its high x - ray luminosity , strong variability , and the high mass of this likely companion star .",
    "it is of great interest to confirm the identity of this compact object , which is comparable in many ways to cyg x-3  a candidate for a rare class of compact star / w - r binaries , which may shed light onto the differing pre - supernova evolutionary scenarios for very massive stars ( clark & crowther 2004 ) .    here",
    "we present our _ xmm - newton _  observations of , together with a re - analysis of the _ chandra _ data studied by @xcite .",
    "these two complementary data sets together give us a comprehensive x - ray view of the galaxy .",
    "the  data provide us with arcsecond spatial resolution , important for isolating point - like sources , especially in regions close to x-1 .",
    "but the data , taken with the detector acis - s in a ( 500 pixel ) sub - array mode , covers only a portion of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the significant pile - up of x-1 adds a degree of spectral complexity@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ccd - readout streak of the source significantly contaminates the `` diffuse '' x - ray component observed .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observations provide both a higher effective photon - collecting area and a larger field coverage than the  observation , albeit with a substantially poorer resolution ( fwhm @xmath15@xmath16 ) . while the pile - up of x-1 is not an issue for the _ xmm - newton _  observations , the ccd - readout streak contamination is serious .",
    "therefore , we need to remove these streaks in order to correctly map out the diffuse x - ray component of .    in this work , we adopt the distance of  to be @xmath17 mpc ( hence @xmath18 = 204 pc ; demers , battinelli , & letarte 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "while data points in plots are shown all with @xmath19 error bars , our quoted parameter uncertainty ranges are at the 90% confidence level unless otherwise noted .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observations were taken on july 3 , 2003 with a total exposure time of @xmath20 45 ks for the epic - mos cameras and @xmath2042 ks for the epic - pn camera .",
    "we use only the data from the pn camera ( with a thin optical blocking filter ) because of its high sensitivity to soft x - rays in the study of diffuse emission and include the data from the mos cameras in the analysis of x-1 . the data from the rgs and om provide no useful information here and are thus not presented here .",
    "we calibrate the data with the sas software ( version 6.1.0 ) , together with the latest calibration files . for the mos data ,",
    "we include only events with patterns 0 through 12 , and the standard mos flags ( xmmea_em ) .",
    "the pn events are filtered to include only events with patterns 0 through 4 , and the pn flags ( xmmea_ep , xmmea_2 , and xmmea_3 ) .",
    "we exclude time intervals with strong flares to reduce the non - cosmic x - ray background , which is due to cosmic - ray induced events , instrumental fluorescence , and soft protons that are funneled towards the detectors by the x - ray mirrors .",
    "we find that the flaring is consistent in the 0.3 - 2 kev and 10 - 15 kev bands , in which the light curves of the observations are examined .",
    "we thus remove time intervals with significant count rate ( cr ) deviations from the mean in the 0.3 - 2 kev band .",
    "the chosen threshold is 0.8 counts  s@xmath21 for the mos and 2.0 counts  s@xmath21 for the pn data .",
    "this filtering leaves a total accepted net exposure time of @xmath20 35.5 ks for each of the two mos cameras and @xmath20 32 ks for the pn camera .    for the pn data , we construct maps in the 0.5 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 4.5 , and 4.5 - 7.5 kev bands .",
    "we have also examined the data in the 0.2 - 0.5 kev band , but find that it contains too many artifacts and little x - ray emission from .",
    "we generate corresponding effective exposure images , using the sas program @xmath22 .",
    "these exposure maps correct for various instrumental artifacts , including bad pixels and columns , the detector quantum efficiency non - uniformity , filter transmission , and telescope vignetting .",
    "such a correction is made on a count image after the removal of a background , which is partly due to non - cosmic x - rays not vignetted by the telescope .",
    "we generate the background data , using the _ skycast _ program and the `` blank sky '' database  source - removed high galactic latitude observations with a total exposure of 352 ks @xcite .",
    "the background data are processed with the same filters as used for the   observations .      the most outstanding artifact in the _ xmm - newton _  data is the southeast - northwest streak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : im_pn_raw1 - 4 ] ) , which was caused by the continuous exposure of the pn ccd ( # 4 ) to x-1 during its readout .",
    "this streak spreads the counts ( statistically ) evenly into columns along the read - out direction of the ccd .",
    "such a streak is typically removed by replacing the affected columns with events randomly generated from an estimated background spectrum .",
    "this simple cosmetic repair , however , would also remove any sources and/or extended structures in the columns and would create new artifacts , especially in regions near x-1 .",
    "we have developed a more effective streak removal method .",
    "we calculate the average intensity distribution as a function of the column number across the ccd chip ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pn_st ] ) , after excluding regions that are significantly affected by diffuse or scattered x-1 emission as well as individual detected sources ( to be discussed later ) .",
    "the calculated streak contribution is then cast into the sky coordinates .",
    "the resultant streak image can then be subtracted from the observed x - ray intensity image .",
    "[ fig : sou_pn ] shows such a `` streak - free '' , background - removed , and flat - fielded intensity image in the 0.5 - 4.5 kev band .",
    "the streak produces no apparent effect in lower or higher energy bands .",
    "a streak image in a sub - energy band can easily be produced with a normalization of the relative intensity of the streak .",
    "the  observation , taken on march 12 , 2003 with an exposure of 29 ks , has already been described by @xcite .",
    "we reprocess the data , using the latest ciao software ( version 3.2.1 ) and calibration database ( version 3.0.0 ) , following the same procedure as detailed in wang et al .",
    "we create acis - s images and corresponding exposure ( flat - fielding ) images in the 0.3 - 0.7 , 0.7 - 1.5 , 1.5 - 3 , and 3 - 7 kev bands .    a ccd - readout streak similar to that seen in the pn data is also found in the  acis - s image in the 0.7 - 3 kev range ( fig .  [ fig : acis_st]a ) .",
    "we remove this ccd - readout streak in the same way as used for the pn data . the total number of counts contributed by the streak is only about 92 , a @xmath23 excess above the local background .",
    "the streak - removed image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acis_st]b .",
    "the  observation has a superb on - axis resolution of 90% eer@xmath24@xmath16within @xmath25 .",
    "however , the psf degrades steeply at larger off - axis angles .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  psf is relatively uniform across much of the pn field of view .",
    "therefore , our use of the   data is limited within the central region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sou_acis ] .",
    "we use an idl - based program to detect sources in both the acis - s and the _ xmm - newton _  pn data . as in the previous applications ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2003 ; wang 2004a ) , this program , optimized to detect point - like sources , uses a combination of detection algorithms : wavelet , sliding - box , and maximum likelihood centroid fitting .",
    "first , we construct the ` mexican cap ' wavelet images on scales of 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 image bins ( bin size @xmath26@xmath16for the pn and 0.5@xmath16for the acis - s ) . on each scale",
    "we search for source candidates corresponding to local maxima with signal - to - noise ratios @xmath27 .",
    "next , we apply a map detection ( ` sliding box ' method ) with a background map produced by excising the source candidates and adaptively smoothing the map to achieve a local count - to - noise ratio greater than 10 . finally , the sources detected with the map method are analyzed by a maximum likelihood algorithm , using both the background map and an approximate gaussian psf .",
    "this analysis gives optimal source positions and their @xmath19 errors .",
    "the source detection in both the map detection and the maximum likelihood analysis is based on data within the 50% psf energy - encircled radius ( eer ) for the pn data and the 90% eer for the acis - s data .",
    "the final accepted sources all have the individual false detection probability @xmath28 ( acis - s ) and @xmath29 ( pn ) . the processed pn data still contain various residual artifacts ( more significant than in the acis - s data ) ; the chosen stringent detection threshold minimizes their effect in the source detection .",
    "the source detections are carried out in the broad ( b ) , soft ( s ) , and hard ( h ) bands , defined differently for the acis - s and pn data sets in the notes to tables 1 and 2 . for each data",
    "set , the detected sources in the three bands are merged together .",
    "multiple detections with overlapping 2@xmath30 centroid error circles are considered to be the same source , and the centroid with the smallest error is adopted .",
    "tables 1 and 2 summarize the results from our source detection in the two data sets . for ease of reference , we will refer to x - ray sources detected in the _ xmm - newton _   pn and  acis data sets with the prefixes xp and xa , respectively ( e.g. , xp-13 ) .",
    "the source locations are marked in the x - ray intensity images ( figs .",
    "[ fig : sou_pn ] and [ fig : sou_acis ] ) .",
    "the detection reveals many more sources in the  data than in the _ xmm - newton _  data in the overlapping region around x-1 .",
    "part of this difference is due to the limited spatial resolution of the _ xmm - newton _  instrument ; the source detection sensitivity is very much affected by the psf of x-1 and the presence of the diffuse emission , as well as source confusion .",
    "nevertheless , most bright x - ray sources in the  field are also detected with the _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "several relatively bright sources , such as xa-13 , xa-17 , and xp-49 ( the pn source next to xa-35 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sou_acis ] ) , should have been detected in both data sets .",
    "the fact that they appear only in one data set indicates their strong variability from one observation to another .",
    "we may further use the _ xmm - newton _  and  data sets to provide limited x - ray spectral information on the detected sources .",
    "most of the _ xmm - newton _  detected sources are apparently outside the optical / near - ir main body of  and are probably unrelated to the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sou_pn ] ) .",
    "the detected sources , on the other hand , are more likely to be associated with the galaxy .",
    "we thus extract an accumulated acis - s spectrum of the sources located in the s3 chip , excluding sources that are located at the edges ( i.e. , xa-12 , 16 , and 23 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : sou_acis ] ) . this spectrum can be characterized ( @xmath31 ) by a power law with a photon index of 1.2(0.89 - 1.6 ) and an absorption column density @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_sou_acis ] ) .",
    "although the constraints on the spectral parameters are generally weak , the index is consistent with the value ( @xmath33 ) expected for typical high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the @xmath34 is considerably lower than that expected total absorption toward sources inside ; the galactic absorption alone is @xmath35 ( stark et al .",
    "the absorption - corrected luminosity of the sources is @xmath36 in the 0.3 - 8 kev band .",
    "therefore , the spectrum , especially in the low energy part , may still significantly be contaminated by galactic objects .    for relatively bright sources , we give hardness ratios to constrain individual spectral properties ( tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "most of the calculated ratios are consistent with a power law that has an index in the range of 1 - 3 , together with a foreground absorption @xmath37 .",
    "such sources are probably x - ray binaries in  or background agns .",
    "soft x - ray sources , especially those with hr1 values @xmath38 ( table 1 ) , should be in our galaxy (  4.1 ) , because the inferred @xmath34 is less than the accepted galactic absorption .",
    "most of the other sources are too faint to be constrained individually . a useful ,",
    "though crude , conversion factor from a count rate ( in either table 1 or 2 ) to an absorption - corrected energy flux in the 0.5 - 8 kev band is @xmath39 @xmath40 for a source with a power law of a photon index @xmath41 and a total x - ray - absorbing gas column density of @xmath42 , reasonable approximations for sources in  ( see  4.1 ) .      the _ xmm - newton _  observations show a large intensity variation of x-1 , a factor of up to @xmath1 and 4 in the pn 0.5 - 2.0 kev and 2.0 - 7.5 kev bands and on a time scale of @xmath43 s ( fig .  [",
    "fig : var ] ) .",
    "this amplitude is a factor of @xmath41 greater than that during the observation @xcite .",
    "similar variability is also seen in the mos data .",
    "the large luminosity dip , as seen in the light curves , could be due to an eclipsing of the accreting compact source by its companion .",
    "we detect no apparent periodic signal ; both the fft power spectrum and the period folding analysis show too much confusion from the harmonics and their aliases of the ccd readout period ( 73.4 ms ) .",
    "[ fig : spec_x1]a shows that the _ xmm - newton _  spectra of x-1 are nearly featureless ( except for various instrumental features ) .",
    "we fit the spectra with various models that are typically used for x - ray binaries , together with a foreground photoelectric absorption .",
    "the overall metal abundance of the absorbing gas is allowed to vary , relative to hydrogen , although the relative metal abundances are fixed to the pattern of balucinska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) .",
    "we find that a simple power law model with a best - fit @xmath44 can be ruled out with a null hypothesis probability of @xmath45 ; the spectra appear to have an intrinsically blackbody - like convex shape .",
    "but the spectra are reasonably well characterized ( @xmath46 ) by the multi - color disk model ( mcd ; i.e. , _ diskbb _ in the _ xspec _ spectral analysis software package ; arnaud 1996 ; makishima et al .",
    "the fitted inner disk temperature and radius are @xmath47 kev and @xmath48 km , where @xmath49 is the inclination angle of the disk , while the absorption column density is @xmath50 with a metal abundance @xmath51 solar ; a fit with the fixed solar metal abundances is not acceptable ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this unusually low metal abundance is probably not physical and may be due to uncertainties in the spectral calibration at low energies .",
    "the absorption - corrected luminosity of the source is @xmath53 in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev band . both the spectral shape and the luminosity of x-1",
    "are very similar to those of the well - studied persistent x - ray binaries with stellar mass bhs ( i.e. , lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , and cyg x-1 ) .    to further characterize the putative bh as well as the accretion disk of x-1 , we fit the _ xmm - newton _  spectra with a self - consistent comptonized mcd ( cmcd ) model ( wang et al . 2004 ; yao et al .",
    "this model is implemented in xspec as a table of spectra generated from monte - carlo simulations of the comptonization , which assumes a spherically symmetric , thermal corona around an accretion disk .",

    "our inferred mass is 4.1(3.1 , 4.9 ) m@xmath5 , which depends weakly on @xmath49 ( within its 90% uncertainty range ) .",
    "but for an extreme spinning bh , the mass could be a factor of up to 6 greater , sensitively depending on @xmath49 ( see fig .  2 in wang et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "there is a marginal presence of an emission line at @xmath62 kev , presumably representing the k@xmath13 transition of neutral or weakly ionized iron .",
    "the inclusion of a narrow gaussian line with the centroid fixed at this energy leads to a small improvement of the fit ( @xmath63 ) and does not significantly change the parameters of the other spectral components .",

    "we further extract two separate sets of spectra in the time intervals less and greater than 8000 s in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] .",
    "however , the total of pn+mos counts in the lower flux interval is only about 470 .",
    "the two spectra show no statistically significant difference .    for comparison with the _ xmm - newton _  spectra",
    ", we further extract a  acis - s spectrum of x-1 from a circle of 8@xmath16radius and a local background spectrum from a concentric annulus of radius 32@xmath16 - 67@xmath16 .",
    "we use the newly improved ciao routine _ mkacisrmf _ to generate the spectral response matrices and include davis s model for the pile - up correction ( davis 2001 ) .",
    "our obtained pile - up fraction is similar to that found in bauer & brandt ( 2004 , who use a different method entirely ) .",
    "the same cmcd model without any parameter adjustment gives an acceptable fit to this acis - s spectrum of x-1 ( @xmath66 ) ; there is only a slight excess of the observed soft x - ray flux above the model .",

    "[ fig : spec_x1]b ] .",
    "the inferred 0.3 - 8 kev luminosity is almost exactly the same as the mean value during the _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "therefore , there is no substantial difference in both the spectral shape and luminosity between the _ xmm - newton _  and  spectra of x-1 .",
    "[ fig : spec_x1]b shows little evidence for residual , emission line - like features that are apparently present in the x-1 spectrum extracted by @xcite , at somewhat unexpected energies ( e.g. , @xmath70 and 3.65 kev ; their fig .  4 and discussion ) .",

    "the remaining @xmath89 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band may be a truly diffuse component .",
    "the luminosity of contribution is about the same as that of the detected sources within , excluding x-1 (  3.1 ) .",

    "we extract a spectrum of the diffuse component in the @xmath90 annulus . from the same region",
    ", we also obtain a background spectrum from the re - projected blank - sky data .",
    "the use of this background spectrum minimizes the effect of instrumental background variation across the detector .",
    "however , the sky background typically varies from one field to another . to account for this variation , we adjust the background spectrum by adding the spectral difference between the  and blank - sky data in an annulus between @xmath91 off x-1 . in all of these spectral extractions ,",

    "thus we conclude that the residual point - like source contribution , corrected for the absorption , is @xmath99 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band and the corresponding hot gas luminosity is a factor of @xmath4 higher",
    ". if an extrapolation of the best - fit thermal plasma model to energies outside the band is a good approximation , the total cooling rate of the plasma should then be about @xmath100 .",
    "following wang ( 2004a ) , we estimate the contribution of background agns in the sources detected from the pn data . this estimate uses a x - ray source log @xmath101 - log @xmath102 relation in the 0.5 - 2 kev band from the  deep survey .",
    "we assume that these agns have a power law with a typical photon index of @xmath103 and are subject to an average foreground absorption of the galactic column density @xmath104 .",
    "accounting for both the sensitivity incompleteness and the eddington bias of our source detection in the 0.5 - 7.5 kev band , we estimate the agn contribution is @xmath105 .",
    "if the absorption is higher ( e.g. , including the column contribution from ) , the contribution would be smaller .",

    "considering the general high extinction expected for the objects in the field , we first use the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite to search for potential counterparts .",
    "we cross - correlate the spatial positions of the objects in the catalog with those from tables  [ pn_source_list ] and [ acis_source_list ] , using a matching radius of 4@xmath16  for pn sources and 2@xmath16  for acis sources .",
    "the radius is chosen to be greater than the @xmath19 statistical position uncertainty of almost all the sources .",
    "table  [ tab_sou_id ] presents the matching results , including the position offset of each match ; there is no match with multiple 2mass objects .",
    "the table also includes the j , h , and k@xmath110 magnitudes of the matched 2mass objects ; the @xmath111 limiting sensitivities of the catalog are 17.1 , 16.4 and 15.3 mag in the three bands .",
    "the x - ray sources with the 2mass matches tend to have soft x - ray spectral characteristics , having negative hardness ratios and/or being detected preferentially in the s band ( tables  [ pn_source_list ] and [ acis_source_list ] ) .",
    "these 2mass objects , many of which also show up in optical images , should mostly be galactic stars .",
    "the 2mass matches with those few sources with relatively hard x - ray spectral characteristics ( namely xp-16 , xp-34 , and xa-11 ) are all very faint ( e.g. k@xmath112 ) ; they may be stars in distant parts of the galaxy",
    ". some of the matches in table  [ tab_sou_id ] should represent chance projections of 2mass objects within the matching regions .",
    "we estimate the expected number of such chance projections to be 0.25 for the acis sources and 2.6 for the pn sources , based on the surface number density of 2mass objects within annuli of radius 4@xmath16 - 15@xmath16around the x - ray sources .",
    "we next use the nasa / ipac extragalactic database and the simbad astronomical database to search for identified objects within 2@xmath16of each x - ray source position .",
    "we find that xp-29/xa-9 matches with an unresolved nonthermal radio source ( yang & skillman 1993 ; chyzy et al .",
    "2003 ) , xp-9 with hd 1486  an eclipsing binary of algol type , and xp-25 with hl90  an hii region in .",
    "increasing the search radius to 4@xmath16only leads to one additional correspondence , i.e. , xp-57 with the nrao vla sky survey radio source nvss j002108 + 591132 .",
    "we have shown that x-1 has a blackbody - like x - ray spectrum . the inferred inner disk temperature ( @xmath113 kev )",
    "is consistent with those found in lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , and cyg x-1  stellar mass bh x - ray binaries .",
    "in contrast , x - ray binaries with intermediate mass bh candidates have substantially lower @xmath114 values ( @xmath115 kev ; e.g. , wang et al .",
    "the spectrum of an accreting neutron star in an x - ray binary system is typically dominated by a power law component and/or an optically thin x - ray photo - ionized plasma ( e.g. , paerels et al .",
    "2000 ) . therefore ,  x-1 is most likely a stellar mass bh associated with the w - r star [ mac92 ] 17a .",
    "the only other known candidate for such an x - ray luminous bh / w - r binary system is cyg x-3 at a distance of @xmath116 kpc in our galaxy ( @xmath1177 ) , although the true nature of this source remains uncertain ( e.g. , mitra 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of cyg x-3 typically shows strong lines , which are interpreted as the evidence for a tenuous x - ray photo - ionized plasma , presumably in the stellar wind from the w - r companion star ( liedahl & paerels 1996 ) .",
    "but occasionally , the line emission weakens substantially , probably during a very high luminosity state ( smale et al .",
    "the spectrum in this state is very similar to that of  x-1 in terms of both @xmath114 and the x - ray luminosity .",
    "longer observations of  x-1 are needed to further the comparative study ( e.g. , to capture the low luminosity state of the source ) . despite its projected location near the galactic plane ,",
    "x-1 is still in a line of sight that is considerabally less confusing and obscured than that of cyg x-3 .",
    "therefore , the study of  x-1 may provide new insights into the end products of most massive stars ( e.g. , the progenitor mass required to form black holes in close binaries ; e.g. , wellstein & langer 1999 ; clark & crowther 2004 ) .",
    "evidence for the diffuse soft x - ray emission in the immediate vicinity of  x-1 has also been presented by @xcite . from a comparison of the radial intensity profile around the source with the psf of the",
    ", they find that a diffuse emission enhancement with a total acis - s cr of @xmath118 extends @xmath119@xmath16 , a scale comparable to the radius of the nonthermal radio shell discovered by yang & skillman ( 1993 ) .",
    "this result is not significantly affected by our removal of the ccd - readout streak , which contributes @xmath120 of the enhancement .",
    "but its morphology is changed from the slightly northeast - southwest extension before the removal ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) to the northwest orientation after the removal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acis_st ] ) .",
    "we have further shown that the lower surface brightness diffuse soft x - ray emission extends at least @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xc_c ] ) , and possibly as far as @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acis_xc_c ] ) , northwest from x-1 .",
    "the morphology of the emission seems to represent an extension of recent intense star - forming regions where the bulk of known w - r stars are located .",
    "the overall extent of the emission appears to outline the boundaries of prominent h@xmath13 streamers / features ; as illustrated by @xcite with a high - quality h@xmath13 image , these features correspond to the shells 6 ( located slightly southwest to x-1 ) , 7 ( northwest to x-1 ) , 8 ( around x-1 ) , and possibly 4/5 further to the northwest .",
    "this morphological similarity suggests an association of the diffuse soft x - ray emission with the h@xmath13 streamers , i.e. , a scaled - up version of the 30 doradus nebula in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "the soft spectral characteristics of the diffuse x - ray emission indicates that it represents diffuse hot gas in .",
    "our spectral analysis also shows marginal evidence for enhanced metal abundances .",
    "but with a temperature of a few @xmath122 k , as we have inferred , this hot gas can not be confined by the gravity of . without sufficient cooling , the gas is likely to escape . indeed , as in many other active star - forming galaxies ( wang et al .",
    "2001 ) , there is an apparent `` missing '' energy problem ( wang 2004b ) . with a typical mass - loss rate of @xmath123 and a wind speed of @xmath124 ,",
    "a w - r star is expected to have a mechanical energy luminosity of @xmath125 . the w - r star population (  1 ) alone could provide sufficient energy to balance the cooling of the diffuse soft x - ray - emitting gas ( @xmath100 ;  3.3 ) .",
    "of course , stellar winds from other massive stars as well as supernova blastwaves together should supply substantially more energy .",
    "but this energy is not observed in x - ray radiation .",
    "most likely , the energy is used to drive the expansion of the various observed energetic structures around recent massive star forming regions .",
    "this process is probably happening in the galaxy s southeast portion , where the hot gas is apparently still confined , naturally explaining the overall morphological similarity between the diffuse soft x - ray emission and the h@xmath13 streamer / features .",
    "once the hot gas is out of the confinement of the ism , the x - ray radiative cooling becomes even less efficient .",
    "this transition has probably occurred around previous star formation regions in the western portion of the galaxy .",
    "these regions , traced by large ( probably quiescent ) faint h@xmath13 shells @xcite , show little diffuse x - ray enhancement .",
    "we have conducted a careful analysis of the _ xmm - newton _   and  x - ray ccd observations of the nearby starburst galaxy . in particular , we have devised an effective method to remove the ccd - readout streaks of the bright source  x-1 .",
    "the main results of our analysis are as follows :    * a list of 73 _ xmm - newton _  and 28  detections of point - like sources in the  field is presented , including preliminary multi - wavelength identifications based on existing databases . while a large portion of these sources are likely to be foreground and background objects , those associated with  tend to show hard x - ray spectral characteristics consistent with high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "* we confirm that x-1 likely represents a bh / w - r binary system .",
    "the mean x-1 luminosity of @xmath0 in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev band is about the same during the _ xmm - newton _  and  observations .",
    "but the source shows large luminosity variation by a factor of up to @xmath1 on time scales of @xmath2 s. the spectrum of x-1 is well characterized by a comptonized multi - color blackbody accretion disk with an inner disk temperature @xmath3 kev , typical of those persistent x - ray binaries with stellar mass bhs ( i.e. , lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , and cyg x-1 ) . for x-1",
    ", we infer the mass of the putative bh as @xmath4 m@xmath5 if it is not spinning , or a factor of up to @xmath1 higher if the spinning is important .",
    "* the presence of the diffuse soft x - ray emission in  is revealed . the emission is morphologically oriented along the optical main body and is greatly enhanced around most active star - forming regions of the galaxy .",
    "the extent of the emission resembles that of luminous h@xmath13 streamers , emanating from starburst regions .",
    "the diffuse soft x - ray emission most likely arises from chemically - enriched hot gas with a characteristic temperature of @xmath126 kev and a total 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity of @xmath7 .",
    "although its total cooling rate ( @xmath127 ) is still quite uncertain , this hot gas could be easily maintained by the mechanical energy input from the observed large w - r star population in the galaxy .",
    "but the x - ray radiation is unlikely to be the main cooling mechanism of the hot gas , which apparently powers various energetic ism features observed around the starburst regions and will eventually escape from the galaxy .",

    "<S> we present an x - ray study of our nearest starburst galaxy ic 10 , based on _ xmm - newton _ and  observations . </S>",
    "<S> a list of 73 _ xmm - newton _  and 28  detections of point - like x - ray sources in the field is provided ; a substantial fraction of them are likely stellar objects in the milky way due to the low galactic latitude location of ic  10 . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest source in the ic  10 field , x-1 , has a mean 0.3 - 8.0 kev luminosity of @xmath0 and shows a large variation by a factor of up to @xmath1 on time scales of @xmath2 s during the _ xmm - newton _  observation . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra of the source indicate the presence of a multi - color blackbody accretion disk with an inner disk temperature @xmath3 kev . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the interpretation of the source as a stellar mass black hole , probably accreting from a wolf - rayet star companion . </S>",
    "<S> we infer the mass of this black hole to be @xmath4 m@xmath5 if it is not spinning , or a factor of up to @xmath1 higher if there is significant spinning . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect an apparent diffuse soft x - ray emission component of ic  10 . </S>",
    "<S> an effective method is devised to remove the x - ray ccd - readout streaks of x-1 that strongly affect the study of the diffuse component in the _ xmm - newton _  and  observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the diffuse x - ray morphology is oriented along the optical body of the galaxy and is chiefly associated with starburst regions . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse component can be characterized by an optically thin thermal plasma with a mean temperature of @xmath6 k and a 0.5 - 2 kev luminosity of @xmath7 , representing only a small fraction of the expected mechanical energy inputs from massive stars in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence that the hot gas is driving outflows from the starburst regions ; therefore , the bulk of the energy inputs may be released in a galactic wind . </S>"
