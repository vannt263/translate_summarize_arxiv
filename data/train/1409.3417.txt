    "if a composite quantum resonance is considered that consists of a cavity strongly coupled to a single quantum dot , such a system will exhibit extreme non - linear behavior in response to even a single energy quantum ; arrays of such resonating systems have been predicted to exhibit unusual repulsive boson behavior for individual photons  @xcite .",

    "it is very difficult , however , to achieve resonant transport in such an array , since all resonators must mutually be tuned to within their linewidth .",
    "this entails a tuning to typically one part in a million , which is extremely challenging with the state - of - the - art in nanotechnology .",
    "therefore , we propose a new hybrid system exploiting alkali atoms in the gas phase as high - q resonators in the photonic crystal environment .    atomic resonances hold several advantages , firstly they exhibit strong and extremely narrow resonances with relative inverse linewidths - or effective quality factors @xmath3 - in the range of @xmath4 and even higher , and secondly their physical properties are extremely well understood .",

    "the shifting of the reflectivity peaks is attributed to the chemical reduction of the sio@xmath20  nanospheres  @xcite ; since cs is strongly caustic , it reduces sio@xmath20  to sio@xmath49  @xcite .",

    "the opal reflectivity peaks are tuned with respect to the atomic resonances .",

    "the spectra is completely without peaks , exactly the opposite of the second spectrum .",
    "moreover , the opal background has recovered even further to 0.05 .",
    "our observations can be qualitatively understood by considering a polarizable atomic medium inside a photonic structure , whose reflectivity peaks shift due to a changing opal refractive index .",

    "[ fig : explanationfig](c ) .    1 .",
    "if the atomic resonance is at the blue edge of the reflectivity peak , an increase in @xmath72 from unity below resonance will effectivly cause the stop gap to red shift at that frequency .",
    "a red shift at the blue edge of a peak reduces the reflectivity . above resonance ,",
    "the opposite happens since @xmath72 is below unity .",
    "the behavior of @xmath72 versus frequency across the resonance thus results in an decreasing and increased reflectivity , as seen at @xmath47 k. on resonance , the enhanced @xmath73 will destroy the destructive interference , thereby increasing the reflectivity .",
    "2 .   for resonances at the trough between two opal reflectivity peaks ,",
    "the increase in @xmath73 on resonance will dominate the reflectivity and cause the two peaks , as seen on the second row where we fitted n=1.58 .",
    "the gradient of the opal s reflectivity vanishes , and any change in @xmath72 will hardly change @xmath74 , since the opal s reflectivity peaks will be little shifted .",
    "3 .   at the red edge of the second opal peak ,",
    "the increase in @xmath72 below resonance will red shift the opal peak . as a result the reflectivity will increase . above resonance ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath72 will blue shift the opal peak , resulting in a decrease of the reflectivity .",
    "hence , the measured reflectivity has a positive correlation with @xmath72 .",
    "the result of increase in @xmath73 depends on whether the resonance is at the foot of the opal reflectivity peak or near the maximum : in the former case , the reflectivity increases , while in the latter case the constructive bragg interference is suppressed , resulting in a reflectivity trough .",
    "4 .   an atomic resonance near the center of the reflectivity peak will lead to following behavior : since the gradient of the reflectivity peak is small at its maximum , the induced shift by the change in @xmath72 will have little effect on the opal s reflectivity .",
    "in contrast , the absorption expressed by the @xmath73 will remove the constructive bragg interference .",
    "hence an increase in @xmath73 will correlate with a trough at resonance , as seen in the last spectrum , at @xmath71 k.    it appears that the resonance frequencies in our experiments are systematically lower from calculated ones .",
    "the difference is attributed to a pressure shift of remnant n@xmath20  in the reservoir . using the shift due to a n@xmath20  buffer gas of -10.97mhz / mbar from ref .",
    "@xcite , a partial pressure of 27 mbar explains the difference .",
    "this partial pressure agrees excellently with a measurement of @xmath75 mbar at evacuation after the experiment .    from the good match between the measured spectra and the theory",
    "curves we conclude that the system is well described by an atomic vapor filling the voids around the opal spheres .",
    "moreover , from the agreement we deduce that the real part of the refractive index must have been less than unity for probe frequencies above resonance . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first observation of sub - unity refractive index in a photonic crystal , inside a stop band .",
    "the striking spectral features reported above reveal that a hybridization occurs between the optical properties of the cesium atoms and the opal structure .",
    "the result of the hybridization depends strongly on the tuning of the atomic resonances relative to the opal s gap structure . the simple case anticipated in fig .",
    "[ fig : concept ] occurs when the atomic resonances are centred in the gap .",
    "this case corresponds to the observations at @xmath71 k in fig .",
    "[ fig : explanationfig ] .",
    "in addition , intriguing hybridizations are observed when the atomic resonances are tuned to either the red or the blue edge of a stop gap . in these cases ,",
    "the real parts of the atomic dispersion come into play , leading to asymmetric reflectivity features in the observed spectra .",
    "this situation differs from arrays of cavities in photonic crystals . in the latter case , the cavities",
    "must necessarily be tuned deep within the gap , in order to profit from the confinement offered by the gaps .",
    "conversely , a cavity resonance tuned to the edge of a gap will obviously be lossy , since the cavity resonance is derived from the surrounding photonic crystal , in contrast to an atomic resonance , that obviously also exists outside a photonic crystal .",
    "in contrast to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) cases of long hollow optical fibers  @xcite or waveguides on a chip  @xcite , three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic crystals have the demonstrated potential to significantly alter the local density of states ( ldos )  @xcite , allowing to control the excited - state lifetime of emitters more in 3d  @xcite than in 1d  @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that the required high atomic densities can be achieved .",
    "several improvements merit investigation in future studies .",
    "first of all , other combinations of gases and photonic crystals will have to be more stable against chemical interactions .",
    "another option is to coat the opal with a thin protective layer or to use light - induced adsorption to increase the alkali pressure .",
    "once these issues are resolved , we can investigate the influence of the ldos on the lifetime of excited states .",
    "the high-@xmath3 resonances in a photonic crystal could even allow to study the thermalization of a photon gas  @xcite .",
    "finally , our experiment could offer an alternative experimental route to complex experiments that are being done with atomic lattices  @xcite .",
    "the measured peaks are somewhat broader than those calculated with our model .",
    "the model does not take into account collisional broadening or transit time broadening .",
    "while collisional self - broadening  @xcite does not play a significant role at our experimental conditions , the n@xmath20  background broadens a delta - function line to about 400mhz fwhm  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the atoms between the opal spheres will have only a small interaction time with the light before hitting a material wall or before being outside the optical focus , leading to transit - time broadening  @xcite . since the magnitude strongly depends on geometry , it is hard to estimate , yet it could easily amount to a few 100mhz . in view of these broadening mechanisms ,",
    "the observed resonances are surprisingly narrow , suggestive of selective reflection effects  @xcite .",
    "in selective reflection , slow atoms with only a small velocity component parallel to the propagation direction of light contribute disproportionately to the signal , leading to sharp spectral features .",
    "the prospect of exploiting selective reflection to yield even sharper features in future makes this system even more attractive .",
    "we report on an experiment in which we infiltrate a dense alkali gas - a saturated cesium vapor - in a thin opal photonic crystal .",
    "the stop bands of the nanostructure are tuned to overlap with the narrow atomic resonances of the alkali atoms , leading to an intriguing hybridization of the atomic resonances and the crystal spectrum .",
    "as the temperature is increased , we observe a shift of the peak opal reflectivity frequency in excess of @xmath76 , which is attributed to the chemical reduction of the silica by the cesium . as a result",
    ", the frequency of the photonic bands are scanned through the near - infrared cs d@xmath1-transition .",
    "simultaneously , the cs resonances undergo marked changes in strength , off - resonance reflectivity , and lineshape . when the atomic resonance is tuned to the red edge of the stop gap",
    ", the reflectivity reveals a striking inversely dispersive shape .",
    "we successfully interpret all observed spectral features by using a transfer - matrix model that includes the dispersion and absorption of two of the hyperfine transitions of cs , as well as the ongoing change of the opal s refractive index due to the chemical reduction .",

    "<S> we study a hybrid system consisting of a narrowband atomic optical resonance and the long - range periodic order of an opaline photonic nanostructure . to this end , we have infiltrated atomic cesium vapor in a thin silica opal photonic crystal . with increasing temperature </S>",
    "<S> , the frequencies of the opal s reflectivity peaks shift down by @xmath0 due to chemical reduction of the silica . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the photonic bands and gaps shift relative to the fixed near - infrared cesium d@xmath1 transitions . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the narrow atomic resonances with high finesse ( @xmath2 ) dramatically change shape from a usual dispersive shape at the blue edge of a stop gap , to an inverted dispersion lineshape at the red edge of a stop gap . </S>",
    "<S> the lineshape , amplitude , and off - resonance reflectivity are well modeled with a transfer - matrix model that includes the dispersion and absorption of cs hyperfine transitions and the chemically - reduced opal . </S>",
    "<S> an ensemble of atoms in a photonic crystal is an intriguing hybrid system that features narrow defect - like resonances with a strong dispersion , with potential applications in slow light , sensing and optical memory . </S>"
