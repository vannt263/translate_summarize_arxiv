    "<S> we investigated the dielectric response of cacu@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ccto ) thin films grown epitaxially on laalo@xmath0 ( 001 ) substrates by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric response of the films was found to be strongly dominated by a power - law in frequency , typical of materials with localized hopping charge carriers , in contrast to the debye - like response of the bulk material . </S>",
    "<S> the film conductivity decreases with annealing in oxygen , and it suggests that oxygen deficit is a cause of the relatively high film conductivity . with increase of the oxygen content , the room temperature frequency response of the ccto thin films changes from the response indicating the presence of some relatively low conducting capacitive layers to purely power law , and then towards frequency independent response with a relative dielectric constant @xmath3 . the film conductance and dielectric response decrease upon decrease of the temperature with dielectric response being dominated by the power law frequency dependence . below @xmath480 </S>",
    "<S> k , the dielectric response of the films is frequency independent with @xmath5 close to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide another piece of evidence for an extrinsic , maxwell - wagner type , origin of the colossal dielectric response of the bulk ccto material , connected with electrical inhomogeneity of the bulk material . </S>"
