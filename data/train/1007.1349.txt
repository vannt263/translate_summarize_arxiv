    "the extraordinary ( optical ) transmission ( eot ) of electromagnetic waves through periodic arrays of subwavelength holes @xcite or slits @xcite made in opaque  mostly metallic  screens has been exhaustively studied along the last decade .",
    "comprehensive review papers reporting on the basic physics behind the phenomenon are available nowadays @xcite . the research of periodic structures has also stimulated the study of the transmission properties through single holes or slits .",
    "sometimes the physics of eot through periodic structures is closely related with the physics of enhanced transmission through single apertures , as it is the case of slits or holes around which the conducting surface is periodically structured @xcite .",
    "the periodically perforated screen or the periodically structured surface ( a metal surface with corrugations , for instance ) support surface waves ( the so - called _ spoof plasmons _",
    "@xcite ) which are strongly excited around certain critical frequencies .",
    "however , any other mechanism provoking field enhancement at the aperture level would automatically induce enhanced transmission .",
    "thus , it seems almost obvious that high quality factor resonators placed close to or inside the holes will produce resonant enhancement of the fields and , consequently , enhanced transmission @xcite .",
    "other methods have been proposed to enhance transmission of electromagnetic waves through electrically small slits or holes @xcite .",
    "a common feature to all the methods mentioned in the previous paragraph is their intrinsic narrow band behavior .",
    "narrow bandwidth is associated with the resonant nature of the underlying cause of the phenomenon .",
    "a completely different approach is proposed in this contribution . the new approach to obtain extraordinary transmission",
    "is based on light squeezing controlled by non - uniform and non - resonant dielectric permittivity distributions around the aperture .",
    "coordinate transformation is applied to design the permittivity distributions and appropriate approximations are introduced to realize a practical all - dielectric device .",
    "this design is tested by in - house fdtd based simulations and a great enhancement is verified when the novel devices are applied to the sub - wavelength aperture .",
    "although some frequency dependence of transmissivity is observed , the bandwidth of the relevant enhanced transmission frequency region is much larger than any previously reported .",
    "the method of coordinate transformation offers us an easy way to control the travelling route of the electromagnetic waves @xcite . in a cartesian coordinates , an incident electromagnetic wave travels straightly , while in a distorted coordinates it turns according to the mesh . on the other hand ,",
    "maxwell s equations are form - invariant under coordinate transformations @xcite , and , therefore , one can manipulate the electromagnetic wave in a distorted space by engineering the background with the necessary material parameters .        the main scheme to enhance the transmission through a sub - wavelength aperture is to build a distorted space which can smoothly induce much more energy from a larger aperture into a smaller one .",
    "[ label:2spaces](a ) shows a space in the cartesian coordinates .",
    "when a plane wave travels into the space from the top , the wave vector @xmath0 is in the direction towards the bottom along the edge of a grid , as illustrated with black arrows , and so is the poynting vector @xmath1 , which represents the flowing of energy . for a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) with a @xmath2 ( @xmath3 the wavelength of free space ) wide slit ,",
    "most incident energy is reflected and little energy could pass through the slit . when the aperture of the slit is enlarged to , for instance , @xmath4 , the transmitted energy increases significantly . a distorted space is designed in fig .  [ label:2spaces](b )",
    ", where the wave vector @xmath0 is bending towards the slit along the curvature of the grids and the energy is guided from a virtual electrically - large aperture to an electrically - small slit . in this way",
    ", the transmission through a sub - wavelength slit could be enhanced dramatically in the distorted space .",
    "a discrete coordinate transformation is used to design the background material for the distorted space . instead of using the general coordinate transformation in the whole space , the transformation is operated between every pair of local coordinates @xcite ( a pair of local coordinates is defined as the example in fig .",
    "[ label:2spaces ] ) . to simplify the problem",
    ", here we only discuss the two dimensional ( 2d ) case with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 components .",
    "the jacobian transformation matrix @xmath8 is used to map one space to the other .",
    "the relative permittivity and permeability values of each block in the distorted space are calculated as @xcite    @xmath9    notice that @xmath8 is defined for every pair of local coordinates and it has a simpler form in this 2-d case as @xmath10    a practical way to realize the distorted space is to use an all - dielectric background material .",
    "it has been proved that if all the local coordinates in the distorted space are quasi - conformal , the background permeability could be considered as unity and quasi - isotropic for the e - polarization @xcite , then , only the permittivity map is required in the z direction . in this scenario , it is difficult to generate a strictly - orthogonal grid to map the distorted space linking the sub - wavelength slit with an electrically large aperture . instead",
    ", very fine meshes are carefully generated in the distorted space to ensure most cells nearly orthogonal , especially in the central region above the slit .",
    "although such an engineering approximation may not represent a mathematically strict transformation , and , hence , is sensitive to wave incident angles for the proposed device , the performance enhancement in terms of extraordinary wave transmission is still evident over a broadband of frequencies , as demonstrated in the following sections .",
    "the relative permittivity ( @xmath11 ) map is given in fig .",
    "[ label : eps ] .",
    "relative permittivity is very close to unity in most parts of the distorted space , which means most of the background material could be considered as air and dielectrics with varying @xmath11 are mainly required in the central area surrounding the slit . the dashed black line in fig",
    ".  [ label : eps ] outlines the profile of such an enhancement device and the detailed permittivity map .",
    "the device has a size of @xmath12 at 8 ghz .",
    "fdtd simulations @xcite are used to test the performance of the designed device without loss of generality .",
    "the operating frequency is set to 8 ghz , the wavelength in free space ( @xmath3 ) being 37.5 mm accordingly .",
    "the sub - wavelength slit on the pec plate is @xmath2 ( 7.5 mm ) wide and @xmath13 ( 2.5 mm ) thick .",
    "the simulation domain is shown in fig .",
    "[ label : field](a ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are applied to realize an incident plane wave with e - polarization impinging from the top .",

    "label : field](c ) ) , a significant enhancement of the field is observed on the other side of the pec plate .",
    "ideally , from the point of view of coordinate transformation , the transmitted energy should be the same in ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "however , the device includes only the central part of the distorted space and the orthogonality in the distorted space is not guaranteed everywhere .",
    "the anisotropic property needs to be included for even enhancing the transmission .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed device still produces strong field enhancement , when comparing figures  [ label : field](a ) and  [ label : field](c ) . a conventional focusing lens is also applied in fig .",
    "[ label : field](d ) to compare the performances .",
    "the lens has an aperture of @xmath4 and its focal point is set to be at the @xmath2 wide slit to focus more energy directly inside the slit .",
    "the transmission through the @xmath2 wide slit increases only slightly .",
    "thus the proposed device outperforms the conventional dielectric lens for field enhancement .",
    "furthermore , the device can be mirrored to the other side of the pec plate as shown in fig .",
    "[ label : field](f ) , and the transmitted electromagnetic wave will travel through a second distorted space and leads to much more enhanced field distribution . fig .",

    "once the lens is added , the field increases slightly .",
    "however , a significant field enhancement is observed when the proposed device is put above the slit .",
    "the amplification at @xmath18 is about 3.25 for amplitude and 10.56 for power .",
    "when the mirrored device is added on the other side , the amplification increases remarkably . around the angle of @xmath19 ,",

    "the energy is recorded at the direction of @xmath19 , from the center of the slit towards the bottom .",
    "when the transmitted waves travel to the far field , the enhancement of energy is preserved once the designed device is applied .",
    "a pair of devices produce much more transmitted energy than a single one all along the propagation path .",
    "note that the blue curve , which represents the energy when a pair of devices are used , is not smooth from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",

    "[ label : poynting ] .",
    "table 1 gives the values of the transmitted energy in different cases .",
    "it is obvious that extremely poor transmission is obtained for the 7.5 mm slit if compared with the energy crossing the 60 mm slit . when a focusing lens is applied , the enhancement is very limited .",
    "but once the enhancement device studied in this paper is located above the 7.5 mm wide slit , the transmission increases dramatically ( it is about 13 times the energy transmitted without the device ) . when applying the second device the transmission",
    "is further increased ( the enhancement factor is about 16 ) . with the implementation of the devices ,",
    "the transmitted energy increases to about @xmath23 of the value when the slit has an aperture of 60 mm .",
