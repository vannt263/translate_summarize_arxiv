    "the integral is readily found to be the difference between the _ retarded and advanced propagators , @xmath155 on the other hand , we find @xmath156 this is nothing but synge s `` elementary solution '' [ p.  360]s65 of the wave equation ! among other things , it has been used by trautman t62 to construct interesting ( null , curling ) analytic solutions of the maxwell and linearized einstein equations . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    i believe this connection between the riemann and synge functions confirms that the transform ast is the `` right '' extension of solutions to @xmath5 . in the absence of the orientation @xmath104 ( with diff now a sum ) , the synge function is no longer the analytic signal of @xmath157 . in particular , we lose the connection with huygens principle in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the synge function is holomorphic on the complement of the complex _ null cone @xmath158 in particular , note that @xmath159 but the second equality is impossible since , by the first , @xmath112 and @xmath3 are both timelike .",

    "all the wavelets are translations of @xmath4 .",
    "this can be further reduced by using the symmetries of @xmath4 , which reflect those of maxwell s equations  the conformal group .",
    "for example , @xmath4 is homogeneous of degree @xmath163 , so the lorentz norm of @xmath3 can be interpreted as a _ scale parameter : @xmath164 _    it is easily shown that @xmath165    there exist ( many equivalent ) _ resolutions of unity k94 , obtained by integrating over various subsets @xmath166 with appropriate measures @xmath167 : @xmath168 this is a `` completeness relation '' dual to the ( non- ) `` orthogonality '' relation rk .",

''    by construction , the wavelets @xmath136 transform covariantly under the poincar group , which endows their parameters @xmath175 with physical significance k94 .",
    "in particular , any resolution ru can be boosted , rotated or translated to give another resolution .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath134 carries a unitary representation of the conformal group @xmath127 , for which @xmath5 is a natural domain , it is useful to study the action of @xmath127 on wavelets . to some extent",
    "this has been done in k94 .",
    "a connection has been discovered recently with work on twistor - like transforms by iwo bilynicki - birula b02 , and we have begun a joint project together with simonetta frittelli .",
    "recall that the absence of sources was the price we paid at the outset for the holomorphy used to construct wavelets .",
    "but now that we have the wavelets , it turns out that we can make them _ physical ( causal ! ) by introducing sources in a way that preserves their holomorphy everywhere _ outside these sources  which is the most that can be expected ! _ _",
    "the introduction of sources will be based on a _",
    "causal splitting of @xmath151 similar to that of @xmath176 .",
    "but whereas the splitting of @xmath176 is lorentz - invariant [ the hyperplane @xmath177 can be tilted without affecting @xmath178 , the corresponding splitting of @xmath151 is frame - dependent .",
    "we must choose a 4-velocity @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) and split @xmath175 into orthogonal temporal and spatial parts @xmath181 without loss of generality , we take @xmath182 in the following .",
    "the general case is recovered by letting @xmath183 begin with the factorization @xmath184 where @xmath185 for motivation , think of @xmath186 as the _ complex distance from a `` point source '' at @xmath187 to the observer at @xmath188 .",

    "'' of which the branch circle is a `` wave front '' and @xmath204 its interior .",
    "similar remarks apply to extended delta functions in @xmath189 , which have provided an intriguing connection k00 between fundamental solutions of laplace s equation in eulidean @xmath119 and the initial - value problem for wave equations in lorentzian @xmath119 .",
