    "the main goal of this paper is to calculate the spectrum of the ck photons emitted by an ultrarelativistic quark and study its properties .",
    "it is important to realize that the ck photon emission and the time - evolution of the magnetic field mentioned above do not interfere since they occur at different time scales . at long time scales ,",
    "neither energy nor magnetic helicity are conserved due to energy dissipation through the induced ohmic electric currents .",
