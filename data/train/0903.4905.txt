    "the experiments are conducted in deep underground laboratories in an effort to reduce the background to minimal levels .",
    "the indirect detection method seeks out debris resulting from wimp annihilations in the galactic halo .",
    "one galactic process that could produce gamma - rays from wimp annihilation is the process @xmath2 , where two gamma - rays are produced directly from a wimp annihilation , and another is @xmath3 .",
    "analyses of direct detection cross - sections and gamma - ray flux within msugra ( or cmssm ) models have been completed  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , a worthwhile pursuit to analyze the direct and indirect detection parameters in alternative models .",
    "the last few years have seen a great deal of interest in type ii string compactifications .",
    "indeed , intersecting d - brane models ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for reviews ) on type ii orientifolds have become particularly attractive .",
    "in contrast to the standard framework , msugra , the supersymmetry - breaking soft terms for intersecting d - brane models are in general non - universal  @xcite . despite substantial progress in constructing such models , most supersymmetric d - brane models suffer from two significant problems .",
    "one problem is the lack of gauge coupling unification at the string scale , and the other is the rank one problem in the standard model ( sm ) fermion yukawa matrices which prevents the generation of mass for the first two generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "nevertheless , there is known one example of an intersecting @xmath06-brane model constructed in type iia theory on the @xmath4 orientifold where these problems have been resolved  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "this model exhibits automatic gauge coupling unification at the tree - level and it is also possible to obtain the correct yukawa mass matrices for both up and down - type quarks and leptons for specific values of the moduli vevs  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the soft - supersymmetry breaking terms for this model have been calculated , where regions in the parameter space were discovered that generate the observed dark matter density and satisfy current experimental constraints  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "although this model has many appealing phenomenological features , one issue still to be completely resolved is that of moduli stabilization . this issue has been addressed to an extent  @xcite  @xcite by turning on fluxes , but there is still the task of stabilizing the open - string moduli associated with d - brane positions in the internal space and wilson lines .",
    "only once the moduli stabilization issue has been completely addressed can this model be considered fully realistic .    in this work",
    "we show the parameter space allowed by all the experimental constraints for this intersecting @xmath06-brane model for varying cases of gravitino masses and tan@xmath5 .",
    "the spin - independent cross - sections are computed and plotted against the current dark matter detection experiment constraints .",
    "furthermore , we present the proton spin - dependent cross - sections , whereas the computed neutron spin - dependent cross - sections only vary slightly from those of the proton , so the neutron cross - sections are not shown .",
    "the gamma - ray flux resulting from neutralino annihilations in the galactic halo for the @xmath06-brane model is plotted and compared to the most recent telescope measurements .",
    "finally , in order to compare our results with a model with universal soft terms representing the opposite extreme , we calculate the spin - independent and spin - dependent cross - sections for the so - called one - parameter model  @xcite , including the gamma - ray flux .",
    "the one - parameter model is a highly constrained small subset of the msugra parameter space such that the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are all functions of the common gaugino mass . in no - scale",
    "supergravity models , generically @xmath6 and @xmath7 , thus the number of free parameters is reduced to two , @xmath8 and tan@xmath5 . adopting a strict no - scale framework",
    ", one can also fix the @xmath9-parameter as @xmath10 , and hence we are led to a _",
    "one - parameter _ model where all of the soft terms may be fixed in terms of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the one - parameter model represents a suitable case with which to compare the intersecting @xmath06-brane model with non - universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "in this section , we give a background discussion for the more technically - minded reader which describes the way in which the supersymmetry breaking soft terms are calculated for intersecting @xmath11-brane models . in recent years , intersecting d - brane models have provided an exciting approach toward constructing semi - realistic vacua . to summarize , d6-branes ( in type iia ) fill three - dimensional minkowski space and wrap 3-cycles in the compactified manifold , with a stack of @xmath12 branes having a gauge group @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 in the case of @xmath15 ) in its world volume .",
    "the 3-cycles wrapped by the d - branes will in general intersect multiple times in the internal space , resulting in a chiral fermion in the bifundamental representation localized at the intersection between different stacks .",
    "the multiplicity of such fermions is then given by the number of times the 3-cycles intersect .",
    "due to orientifolding , for every stack of d6-branes we must also introduce its orientifold images .",
    "thus , the d6-branes may also have intersections with the images of other stacks , also resulting in fermions in bifundamental representations .",
    "each stack may also intersect its own images , resulting in chiral fermions in the symmetric and antisymmetric representations .",
    "in addition , there are constraints that must be satisfied for the consistency of the model , namely the requirement for ramond - ramond tadpole cancellation and to have a spectrum with @xmath16 supersymmetry .    to discuss the low - energy phenomenology we start from the low - energy effective action .",
    "from the effective scalar potential it is possible to study the stability  @xcite , the tree - level gauge couplings @xcite , gauge threshold corrections @xcite , and gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "the effective yukawa couplings @xcite , matter field khler metric and soft - susy breaking terms have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the khler metric and string scattering of gauge , matter , and moduli fields has been performed in @xcite .",
    "although turning on type iib 3-form fluxes can break supersymmetry from the closed string sector  @xcite , there are additional terms in the superpotential generated by the fluxes and there is currently no satisfactory model which incorporates this .",
    "thus , we do not consider this option in the present work . in principle , it should be possible to specify the exact mechanism by which supersymmetry is broken , and thus to make very specific predictions .",
    "however , for the present work , we will adopt a parametrization of the susy breaking so that we can study it generically .",
    "the @xmath16 supergravity action depends upon three functions , the holomorphic gauge kinetic function , @xmath17 , k``ahler potential @xmath18 , and the superpotential @xmath19 .",
    "each of these will in turn depend upon the moduli fields which describe the background upon which the model is constructed .",
    "the holomorphic gauge kinetic function for a d6-brane wrapping a calibrated three - cycle @xmath20 is given by ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion and explanation of the notation ) @xmath21.\\ ] ] in terms of the three - cycle wrapped by the stack of branes , we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the wrapping numbers of the d - branes on the @xmath25th two - torus , from which it follows that @xmath26 where @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 or @xmath31 gauge groups and where we use the @xmath32 and @xmath33 moduli in the supergravity basis . in the string theory basis , we have the dilaton @xmath34 , three khler moduli @xmath35 , and three complex structure moduli @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "these are related to the corresponding moduli in the supergravity basis by @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the four - dimensional dilaton . to second order in the string matter fields , the k''ahler potential is given by @xmath39 the untwisted moduli @xmath40 , @xmath41 are light , non - chiral scalars from the field theory point of view , associated with the d - brane positions and wilson lines .",
    "these fields are not observed in the mssm , and if present in the low energy spectra they may disrupt the gauge coupling unification .",
    "clearly , these fields must get a large mass through some mechanism .",
    "one way to accomplish this is to require the d - branes to wrap rigid cycles , which freezes the open string moduli  @xcite .    for twisted moduli arising from strings stretching between stacks @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", we have @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the angle between the cycles wrapped by the stacks of branes @xmath42 and @xmath43 on the @xmath46 torus respectively .",
    "then , for the k\"ahler metric in type iia theory we find the following two cases :    * @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 + @xmath50 * @xmath47 , @xmath51 , @xmath49 + @xmath52    for branes which are parallel on at least one torus , giving rise to non - chiral matter in bifundamental representations ( for example , the higgs doublets ) , the k``ahler metric is @xmath53 the superpotential is given by @xmath54 while the minimum of the f part of the tree - level supergravity scalar potential @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 is inverse of @xmath60 , and the auxiliary fields @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 supersymmetry is broken when some of the f - terms of the hidden sector fields @xmath63 acquire vevs .",
    "this then results in soft terms being generated in the observable sector .",
    "for simplicity , it is assumed in this analysis that the @xmath0-term does not contribute ( see @xcite ) to the susy breaking . then the goldstino is absorbed by the gravitino via the superhiggs effect .",
    "the gravitino then obtains a mass @xmath64 which we will take to be 500 gev and 700 gev in the following .",
    "the normalized gaugino mass parameters , scalar mass - squared parameters , and trilinear parameters respectively may be given in terms of the k''ahler potential , the gauge kinetic function , and the superpotential as @xmath65 , \\label{softterms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the k\"ahler metric appropriate for branes which are parallel on at least one torus , i.e. involving non - chiral matter .",
    "the above formulas for the soft terms depend on the yukawa couplings , via the superpotential .",
    "an important consideration is whether or not this should cause any modification to the low - energy spectrum .",
    "however , this turns out not to be the case since the yukawas in the soft term formulas are not the same as the physical yukawas , which arise from world - sheet instantons and are proportional to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the world - sheet area of the triangles formed by a triplet of intersections at which the standard model fields are localized .",
    "the physical yukawa couplings in type iia depend on the k\"ahler moduli and the open - string moduli .",
    "this ensures that the yukawa couplings present in the soft terms do not depend on either the complex - structure moduli or dilaton ( in the supergravity basis ) .",
    "thus , the yukawa couplings will not affect the low - energy spectrum in the case of @xmath33-moduli dominant and mixed @xmath33 and @xmath32 dominant supersymmetry breaking .    to determine the susy soft breaking parameters , and therefore the spectra of the models , we introduce the vevs of the auxiliary fields eq .",
    "( [ aux ] ) for the dilaton , complex and khler moduli @xcite : @xmath69 the factors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the cp violating phases of the moduli , while the constant @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 the goldstino is absorbed into the gravitino by @xmath74 in @xmath34 field space , and @xmath75 parameterize the goldstino direction in @xmath36 space , where @xmath76 .",
    "the goldstino angle @xmath77 determines the degree to which susy breaking is being dominated by the dilaton @xmath32 and/or complex structure ( @xmath78 ) and khler ( @xmath79 ) moduli . as suggested earlier",
    ", we will not consider the case of @xmath80-moduli dominant supersymmetry breaking , since in this case the soft terms are not independent of the yukawa couplings .",
    "the set of soft terms at the unification scale are generated in the same manner as was performed in  @xcite for @xmath81-moduli dominated susy breaking .",
    "the soft terms are then input into micromegas 2.0.7  @xcite using suspect 2.34  @xcite as a front end to run the soft terms down to the electroweak scale via the renormalization group equations ( rges ) and then to calculate the corresponding relic neutralino density .",
    "we take the top quark mass to be @xmath82  gev  @xcite , and leave tan  @xmath5 as a free parameter while @xmath83 is determined by the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) .",
    "however , we do take @xmath84 as suggested by the results of @xmath85 for the muon .",
    "the results are then filtered according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "the wmap 5-year data  @xcite for the cold dark matter density , 0.1109 @xmath86 0.1177 .",
    "we also consider the wmap 2@xmath87 results  @xcite , 0.095 @xmath86 0.129 .",
    "in addition , we look at the ssc model  @xcite for the dark matter density , in which a dilution factor of @xmath88(10 ) is allowed  @xcite , where @xmath89 1.1 . for a discussion of the ssc model within the context of msugra , see  @xcite . we investigate two cases , one where a neutralino lsp is the dominant component of the dark matter and another where it makes up a subdominant component such that 0 @xmath86 0.1177 , 0 @xmath86 0.129 , and 0 @xmath86 1.1 .",
    "this allows for the possibility that dark matter could be composed of matter such as axions , cryptons , or other particles .",
    "2 .   the experimental limits on the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process , @xmath90 .",
    "the results from the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag )  @xcite , in addition to the babar , belle , and cleo results , are : @xmath91 .",
    "there is also a more recent estimate  @xcite of @xmath92 . for our analysis",
    ", we use the limits @xmath93 , where experimental and theoretical errors are added in quadrature .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath94 . for this analysis",
    "we use the 2@xmath87 level boundaries , @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "4 .   the process @xmath96 where the decay has a @xmath97 dependence .",
    "we take the upper bound to be @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "5 .   the lep limit on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass , @xmath99 gev  @xcite .",
    "a scan of the parameter space allowed by the aforementioned five experimental constraints was performed for various values of the gravitino mass and tan@xmath5 , with the goal to determine the range of the gravitino mass where the upper limit is the mass at which susy events become observable at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) above the sm background , and at the lower limit the higgs mass becomes too light and violates the lep constraint .",
    "we discover the upper limit to be @xmath100 @xmath101 700 gev and the lower limit to be in the range @xmath100 = 400 @xmath102 500 gev .",
    "thus , we calculate the relic density , experimental constraints , and subsequently , the direct detection cross - sections and indirect detection gamma - ray flux for @xmath100 = 500 gev and @xmath100 = 700 gev . for each of these gravitino masses ,",
    "the calculations were completed for tan@xmath5 = 10 , 25 , and 46 .",

    "the three marker colors identify the dark matter density.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ]    it is an intriguing question as to how a model with non - universal soft - supersymmetry breaking terms , such as an intersecting @xmath06-brane model , compares to a model with universal soft - supersymmetry breaking terms , for example , msugra .",
    "the one - parameter model ( opm )  @xcite is a highly constrained small subset of msugra , where all the soft - supersymmetry breaking terms may be fixed in terms of the gaugino mass @xmath8 .",
    "the opm has universal soft - supersymmetry breaking terms , so it is ideal to compare to the @xmath06-brane model .",
    "details of the phenomenology of the opm using the most recent measurements of the experimental constraints can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the parameter space of the opm is quite constrained by the experimental constraints , and this leads to small regions of allowed direct and indirect detection parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : opm ] we plot the direct and indirect detection parameters of the opm .",
    "as described in  @xcite , the range of tan@xmath5 for spectra that satisfy all the experimental constraints in the wmap region is 35.2 @xmath106 tan@xmath5 @xmath106 38 , while the range in the ssc region is 10.2 @xmath106 tan@xmath5 @xmath106 38 .",
    "note that the points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opm ] are for all tan@xmath5 within the aforementioned ranges .",
    "however , it can be concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig : opm ] that the points with the same wimp mass do exhibit the same characteristics as the points in the intersecting @xmath06-brane model . for the same wimp mass ,",
    "the wmap spectra have a larger annihilation cross - section , and hence , gamma - ray flux than the ssc points , due to the fact that in the wmap region , we are not allowing for the @xmath88(10 ) dilution factor to @xmath120 .",
    "much advancement has been made in the last few years toward the discovery of dark matter .",
    "current generation direct detection experiments that search for elastic collisions of wimps off nuclei have come within shouting distance of the allowed parameter space of models with universal soft - supersymmetry breaking terms such as msugra .",
    "furthermore , the fermi gamma - ray space telescope is edging closer to the parameter space of these same models . in light of this experimental progress",
    ", it is a good time to start examining the direct and indirect detection parameters of semi - realistic string models . to this end",
    ", we began an investigation of the experimental detection parameters for a particular string - derived model with many appealing phenomenological properties .",
    "there are various theoretical models currently offered , so our goal is present the phenomenology of a promising new model , in contrast to the usual standard , msugra . in this work ,",
    "we investigated an intersecting @xmath06-brane model on a type iia orientifold that overcomes the persistent problems experienced by many type ii string vacua , namely that of gauge coupling unification and the generation of masses for the first two generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "this model exhibits automatic gauge coupling unification and allows the correct masses and mixings for all quarks and leptons to be obtained . as a consequence",
    ", we presented the spin - independent and proton spin - dependent cross - sections .",
    "we find that only a small region of the allowed parameter space is within the current limits of the direct detection experiments .",
    "regions with a larger @xmath120 have smaller cross - sections , thus cross - sections for ssc are smaller than those of wmap .",
    "additionally , we illustrated the galactic gamma - ray flux for this model resulting from neutralino annihilations .",
    "we discover that most of the regions of the @xmath06-brane model allowed parameter space will be within the sensitivity of the fermi telescope .",
    "this research was supported in part by the mitchell - heep chair in high energy physics ( cmc ) , by the cambridge - mitchell collaboration in theoretical cosmology , and by the doe grant de - fg03 - 95-er-40917 .",
