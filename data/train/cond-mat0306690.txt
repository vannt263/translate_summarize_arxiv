    "one of the fundamental properties of superconductors is ideal diamagnetism in magnetic fields smaller than the first critical field ( @xmath6 ) , the so - called meissner effect .",
    "however , a number of measurements carried out in superconductors has revealed a paramagnetic signal in the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment ( @xmath7 ) which appears upon cooling down the samples in a magnetic field through the transition temperature @xmath8 ( the field cooling regime ) @xcite . in this case , the paramagnetic contribution exceeds the diamagnetic part , leading to an overall paramagnetic signal .",
    "this effect is called the paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) or wohlleben effect @xcite .",
    "three theories have been suggested to account for the origin of the effect .",
    "( i ) the @xmath9-symmetry of the order parameter can lead to the existence of spontaneous ",
    "paramagnetic \" super - currents in the superconductor due to the presence of @xmath10-contacts @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the koshelev - larkin ( kl ) model @xcite considers the redistribution of abrikosov vortices trapped in the superconductor upon the transition to the superconducting state , leading to the appearance of the paramagnetic signal in @xmath7 .",
    "( iii ) the giant vortex state , existing in the surface superconductivity state , can also lead to a total paramagnetic signal if the temperature is decreased and the trapped flux within the giant vortex is compressed @xcite .",
    "the observations of pme in conventional superconductors with @xmath11-symmetry @xcite has indicated that @xmath9-symmetry of the order parameter is not a necessary condition for the appearance of pme . the giant vortex approach outlined in refs",
    ".   assumes a special geometry with the sample s extended surfaces oriented parallel to the field in order to facilitate the appearance of the giant vortex state .",
    "however , a large number of experiments have been carried out on films in fields perpendicular to the largest film surfaces .",
    "therefore , the quantitative comparison of theoretical dependences obtained in the framework of the giant vortex model @xcite with experimental results is inadequate due to the necessity of taking into account the real boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , this model can be the most appropriate for the explanation of pme in the vicinity of the superconducting transition , since fluctuations of the order parameter do not permit the formation of a pure abrikosov vortex state , which is a necessary condition for the explanation of pme in the framework of the kl model .",
    "well below @xmath8 ( or below the irreversibility line @xmath12 ) the kl model is the most suitable one for the description of @xmath7 in thin films .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the experimental results obtained in this work will be carried out within the framework of this model .    in this",
    "work temperature dependences of the magnetic moment have been measured over a wide magnetic field range in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 ( ybco ) thin films grown by different methods .",
    "the experimental results obtained have been analyzed in the framework of the kl model @xcite , which turns out to be the most appropriate for our experimental conditions .",
    "single crystalline high temperature superconducting ( hts ) ybco thin films have been investigated in this work .",
    "the films were grown by ( i ) pulsed - laser deposition ( pld ) @xcite and by ( ii ) off - axis dc magnetron sputtering @xcite techniques .",
    "these techniques produce epitaxial films with the crystallographic @xmath14-axis oriented perpendicular to the film surface @xcite . in this case , as shown by high resolution electron microscopy @xcite , the films grown on a mismatched substrate develop numerous out - of - plane edge dislocations .",
    "the dislocations are usually arranged in so - called dislocation walls ( rows ) , forming 30 to 250  nm large domains .",
    "the domains are typically misaligned by @xmath15 to @xmath16 , depending on film growth conditions . in this work ,",
    "a @xmath17  nm thick pld film ( pp17 ) with @xmath18  k , as well as two @xmath17  nm thick magnetron sputtered films ( k21 and k1509 ) with @xmath19  k have been investigated .",
    "the most extensively investigated k1509-film was sputtered onto a rotating sapphire substrate buffered by ceo@xmath0 with a diameter of 51  mm .",
    "all the films investigated have a quite narrow transition width of @xmath20 to 0.5  k and a high critical current density of @xmath4  a/@xmath5 at @xmath21  k in self - field .",
    "the film growth rate of the magnetron sputtering was approximately 0.01 to 0.02  nm / s . in these films ,",
    "the layer - by - layer ( nearly two - dimensional ) growth mechanism is realized .",
    "in contrast , in the films grown by the pld procedure with a growth rate of 0.1 to 0.2  nm / s , the three - dimensional island - like mechanism is most likely to occur .",
    "therefore , the magnetron sputtered films usually have a significantly smaller density of stacking faults and accompanying dislocation loops ( @xmath22  lines/@xmath5 as estimated by high resolution electron microscopy @xcite ) than is in the case of the pld films .",
    "the size of the domains in the magnetron sputtered films is usually larger ( up to 250  nm ) , as well as more ordered and equidistantly spaced than in the pld films .",
    "the misalignment angles are typically @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the average density of the edge dislocations is likely to be slightly smaller than in the pld films .",
    "similar characteristics should be expected for the k1509-film with @xmath24  a/@xmath5 .",
    "all the measured pieces of the films were of a similar rectangular shape with dimensions @xmath25  mm@xmath26 .",
    "the temperature and field dependences of the magnetic moment were investigated by employing a quantum design mpms squid magnetometer in fields @xmath27  t and temperatures @xmath28  k. the temperature dependences were measured in the field - cooled ( fc ) regime , i.e. the films were cooled through @xmath8 with a magnetic field applied .",
    "the mpms squid detection system comprises squid sensing loops configured as a highly balanced second - derivative pickup coil set with a total length of @xmath29  cm .",
    "the coils are designed to reject the uniform field from the superconducting magnet to a precision of approximately 0.1% .",
    "the magnetic moment of a sample is calculated from the response curve of the squid pickup coils which is measured as the sample moves through the coils along a scan length ( typically 4  cm ) .",
    "the temperature of the sample is measured , depending on the temperature range , either by a sensor fixed at the null point of the pickup coils in the cooling annulus around the sample space or by a sensor located under the bottom of the sample tube @xcite .",
    "this quite  remote \" temperature sensing is expected to be insensitive to any possible temperature gradient along the scan length .",
    "experimentally , we did observe some temperature destabilization at scan lengths @xmath30  cm , which is a common feature for this kind of instrument .",
    "this observation can imply that we do indeed deal with a temperature gradient .",
    "accordingly , the smaller the scan length is , the smaller the difference between the minimal and maximal temperatures will be .",
    "therefore , the possibility of significant temperature fluctuations in the measured samples becomes negligible for sufficiently small scan lengths .",
    "the @xmath31 dependencies shown in fig .  [ jc ] , which are necessary for the quantitative result analysis , have been obtained from the width of the magnetization loops @xcite .",
    "the so - obtained @xmath31 were highly consistent with @xmath31 obtained by the direct transport method and from clem - sanchez analysis @xcite of ac susceptibility measurements of the films in perpendicular fields @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 behavior has suggested @xcite that the mechanisms of critical current limitation can be attributed to strong pinning of vortices on linear defects , most likely edge dislocations which are perpendicular to the film surface .",
    "critical current density as a function of the applied magnetic field measured at different temperatures for the k1509 film . ]",
    "the fc dependences of @xmath7 measured in the k1509 , pp17 and k21 films are qualitatively consistent with each other , and therefore , in what follows , the results for the k1509-film will be shown . the measurements at different cooling rates ( 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.25 and 0.5  k / min ) and different scan lengths ( 4 , 2 , 1.5 , 1 and 0.75  cm ) are exhibited in figs .",
    "[ two ] and [ three ] , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , different cooling rates do not have a significant qualitative influence on the @xmath7 behavior .",
    "the small discrepancies might be explained either by temperature lags at the highest sweep rates or by the influence of the magnetic flux distribution effects described in the next section .",
    "in contrast , changes in scan length qualitatively modify the @xmath32 behavior below @xmath8 .",

    "the measurements indicate that the profile of the trapped magnetic flux which determines the value of the @xmath32 signal may be influenced by certain experimental conditions , such as the scan length and the applied magnetic field .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , changes in the @xmath32 value observed in the experiments are governed by relatively small changes in the vortex compression .",
    "moreover , we show that the vortex compression in the films is _ extremely _ sensitive to seemingly negligible changes in experimental conditions , which can explain various experimental results reported on the paramagnetic meissner effect in the literature and in fig .",

    "[ int ] , from the point of view of the real geometry of the experiment , the most likely mechanism for the appearance of the pme is the inhomogeneous redistribution of vortices upon cooling a ybco film below @xmath8 . note that in this case the term  paramagnetic _",
    "effect ( pme ) - would inappropriately reflect the nature of the effect , which should be rather referred to as the paramagnetic effect or the positive magnetization effect ( pme ) .",
    "vortex distributions leading to the pme are considered in the model developed by koshelev and larkin @xcite .",
    "the geometry of this model is shown in fig .",

    "this process results in increasing compression and decreasing flux in decreasing temperature .",

    "this deviation of @xmath80 from monotonic behavior as a function of field and temperature at the lowest measurement field can be explained by the entry of additional vortices from the film edges as the temperature is decreased .",
    "the conditions for entry are defined by the sheet currents , which , in turn , significantly depend on the degree of vortex compression in the film .",
    "vortex entry through the edges of the film in this case is facilitated by the small number of vortices and the strong compression in the field as a result of relatively large sheet currents .",

    "10% field gradient over the 4  cm scan length in the magnet bore along its axis .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the magnetic flux change @xmath99 within the film does not necessarily imply the entry or exit of vortices .",
    "this is because for a given amount of vortices the flux is defined by their gradient ( @xmath41 ) and compression ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this means that with a fixed amount of vortices we get different values of @xmath59 by changing @xmath58 .",
    "changes in @xmath58 mainly occur due to changes in the sheet currents , flowing in vortex free film regions ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "thus , the discrepancies between the @xmath7 curves in fig .",
    "[ three ] are due to changes in the magnetic flux profile in the film , which are , in turn , caused by inhomogeneous field distribution in the magnet .    moreover , as the sample moves through the squid pickup coils it is likely to experience not only the field inhomogeneity , but also the temperature gradient along the length of the scan .",
    "the latter factor would play a boosting role in redistribution of the flux profile , which would occur due to temperature variations within the sample . in the vicinity of @xmath8 , the effect of the temperature variations",
    "can be even more pronounced due to strong fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the influence of the temperature gradient is a rather unpredictable factor , which may depend on temperature , the parameters of the temperature controller and the level of liquid helium inside the cryostat .",
    "in addition , the field gradient of a magnet can also be a variable .",

    "therefore , the influence of these factors on the flux profile may have led to somewhat non - reproducible @xmath7 behavior in fig .  [ three ] and might explain various experimental results available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the question arises why three orders of magnitude of the external field introduce a relatively small change in @xmath7 behavior ( fig .",

    "the degree of the vortex re - arrangement depends on the vortex mobility , which , in turn , can depend on @xmath35 and @xmath116 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath117 change would be negligible , since @xmath118 ( eq .  ( [ e3 ] ) ) .",

    "this imbalance between the paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions can lead to considerable , even qualitative changes in the @xmath7 behavior observed ( fig .  [",
    "three ] ) .    an additional factor , which can contribute to differences in fc @xmath7 behaviors for similar samples , is structural imperfection . in films as in our case , differences in the quality of the film edges can also define the structure of the vortex ensemble in the films @xcite and , together with field and temperature gradients , lead to some differences between @xmath7 behaviors observed for different films produced and measured under similar conditions .",
    "in conclusion , the origin of the paramagnetic meissner effect in experimental @xmath119 dependences obtained in ybco films was shown to be in good quantitative agreement with the model of vortex compression proposed in ref .  .",
    "for a consistent description of the @xmath119 dependencies in the frame of the model , the experimental @xmath120 dependence has to be taken into account , and this was independently determined in refs .  .",
    "upon changing the applied field by three orders of magnitude , the absolute value of the pme is changed by less than one order of magnitude .",
    "this change can be explained by , firstly , the field independent behavior of @xmath41 at @xmath121  oe and , secondly , by the degradation of @xmath117 at @xmath122  oe , which is compensated by a sharp decrease of the vortex compression ( @xmath123 ) and magnetic flux in the film . the discrepancies between the experimental curves of @xmath7 obtained at different scan lengths can be accounted for by the influence of field and temperature gradients along the scan length of the samples .",

    "<S> this finding indicates that the origin of the paramagnetic effect is ultimately associated with nucleation and inhomogeneous spatial redistribution of magnetic vortices in a sample which is cooled down in a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the distribution of vortices is extremely sensitive to the interplay of film properties and the real experimental conditions of the measurements . </S>"
