    "<S> these conditions are satisfied for the parameters used in the calculations and are facilitated by the electromagnetic nonlocality of thin film edge junctions @xcite , particularly monolayer junctions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a small power @xmath130 dissipated by a moving vortex at @xmath29 does not really affect the cherenkov instability . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath130 generated by a vortex at the critical velocity @xmath131 in a thin film junction is given by @xcite : @xmath132 this equation shows that the power @xmath130 is independent of @xmath15 and is greatly reduced in the underdamped limit at low temperatures as the quasiparticle resistance @xmath20 of sis junctions becomes exponentially large at @xmath133 . to estimate @xmath130 , it is convenient to write equation ( [ p ] ) in the form @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is a characteristic line energy of abrikosov vortex @xcite . for an edge junction in a nb film with @xmath136 nm , @xmath137 nm , @xmath138 kelvin / nm , and @xmath139 ghz much smaller than @xmath140 thz @xcite , equation ( [ p ] ) yields @xmath141 nw at @xmath142 . local overheating @xmath143 caused by vortex dissipation </S>",
    "<S> is further reduced in thin film junctions for which the energy transfer to the substrate due to ballistic phonons is much more effective than diffusive phonon heat transport in thick samples , where @xmath144 is the kapitza interface thermal resistance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such weak overheating caused by a moving vortex can not result in thermal bistability and hysteric switching due to hotspot formation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> proliferation of vortex - antivortex pairs triggered by a moving josephson vortex can be essential for the physics and applications of weak link superconducting structures where the formation of expanding phase pile patterns can switch the entire junction into a normal state at currents well below the josephson critical current , @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> such dynamic vortex instability can result in hysteretic jumps on the v - i curves which appear similar to those produced by heating effects @xcite , yet this instability is affected by neither cooling conditions nor the nonequilibrium kinetics of quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , heating is most pronounced in overdamped junctions with @xmath146 in which cherenkov radiation is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the cherenkov instability is characteristic of the weakly - dissipative underdamped limit @xmath29 , although figure [ iv ] shows that this instability in thin film edge junctions can persist up to @xmath147 . therefore , the crucial initial stage of the phase pile formation at @xmath29 is unaffected by heating which may become more essential at the final stages of the transition of the entire junction into the normal state . at @xmath148 </S>",
    "<S> the cherenkov instability may be masked by heating effects , particularly in bulk junctions for which heat transfer to the coolant is less efficient than in thin films .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the instability reported here does not require special junctions with @xmath149 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even for the seemingly conventional bulk junction with @xmath150 shown on the top panel of figure [ iv ] , the instability at @xmath151 implies @xmath152 , which translates into @xmath153 for bulk nbn junctions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in wide thin film edge junctions the nonlocality becomes important at even much lower @xmath15 , as is evident from the lower panel of figure [ iv ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the effects reported here can occur in conventional underdamped junctions with @xmath154 , particularly wide thin film or monolayer edge junctions . </S>",
    "<S> interaction of josephson vortices with pinned abrikosov vortices in electrodes can result in additional mechanisms of splitting instability of josephson vortices . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , radiation by josephson vortices can be greatly enhanced as they move in a periodic magnetic potential of abrikosov vortices along weak link grain boundaries @xcite , whereas abrikosov vortices trapped perpendicular to the josephson junction can result in generation of josephson vortex - antivortex pairs in the presence of the applied electric current @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results can be essential for other topological defects such as crystal dislocations or magnetic domain walls described by the generic nonlocal equation ( [ int ] ) in which the integral term results from a common procedure of reduction of coupled evolution equations for several relevant fields to a single equation . for josephson junctions , such coupled fields are @xmath155 and @xmath156 , but for domain walls in ferromagnets , the nonlocality can result from long - range magnetic dipolar interactions @xcite . for dislocations , </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocality and cherenkov radiation of sound waves in equation ( [ int ] ) come from the discreteness of the crystal lattice @xcite and long - range strain fields @xcite , although the dynamic terms in the peierls equation @xcite are more complex than those in equation ( [ int ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> dynamic instabilities of dislocations have been observed in the lattice frenkel - kontorova models @xcite in which sonic radiation can also result from periodic acceleration and deceleration of a dislocation moving in a crystal peierls - nabarro potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effect becomes more pronounced as the dislocation core shrinks at higher velocities and becomes pinned more effectively by the lattice . by contrast , the instability reported here results entirely from cherenkov radiation , the condition ( [ cher ] ) can be satisfied for any system in which @xmath74 in equation ( [ cher ] ) decreases with @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> this instability can thus have broader implications : for instance , the phase pile dynamics of josephson vortices appears similar to a microcrack propagation caused by a continuous pileup of subsonic dislocations with antiparallel burgers vectors at the opposite tips of a growing crack described by equations ( [ int ] ) and ( [ log ] ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results give a new insight into breakdown of a global long - range order which has been usually associated with either thermally - activated proliferation of topological defects ( like in the berezinskii - kosterletz - thouless transition ) or static arrays of quenched topological defects pinned by the materials disorder @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we point out a different mechanism in which a long - range order is destroyed as a single topological defect driven by a strong external force becomes unstable and triggers a cascade of expanding pairs of topological defects of opposite polarity . </S>"
