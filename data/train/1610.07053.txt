    "generated event properties must be distributed correctly according to the model used .",
    "this is often achieved by rejection sampling : randomly throwing sets of interaction properties and accepting interactions with a probability proportional to the predicted cross - section for that event .",
    "when tuning free model parameters to data , many sets of model predictions must be generated to investigate how the model fits the data .",
    "it is often advantageous to ` reweight ' model predictions to determine the response of varying free parameters rather than fully recalculating them .",
    "each generated event comes with an associated ` weight ' which is proportional to the probability for that event .",
    "reweighting is the process of calculating a scaling factor which can be combined with the original event weight to give a new weight which would be correct if the event had been generated under some different set of free parameter values .",
    "this process involves no monte carlo techniques and so no computational time is ` wasted ' , it can be many orders of magnitude faster than re - generation .",
    "this significant boost in efficiency makes more involved studies of systematic uncertainty and goodness - of - fit feasible . generating @xmath5 events using the numi on - axis flux",
    "was found to take @xmath6 , while reweighting those events to a new prediction took @xmath7 on a single cpu core , and @xmath8 when parallelised over 32 cores .",
    "nuwro now supports reweighting of free - nucleon model parameters for charged current quasi elastic ( ccqe ) @xcite and single pion production ( spp ) interactions  important interaction channels at beam energies of @xmath9 .",
    "three free model parameters are available for spp events : @xmath3  and @xmath2  are free parameters in the baryonic resonance form factors@xcite .",
    "the other free parameter , @xmath4  is a scale factor for the cross section of spp through non - resonant processes .",
    "[ fig : rwvalid ] shows the effect of simultaneously varying @xmath2  and @xmath3  on the spp @xmath0  distribution .",
    "it can be seen that the reweighting very precisely reproduces the fully re - generated prediction .",
    "[ fig : dialresponse ] shows the effect of reweighting the three parameters on the spp cross section as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath3  and decreasing @xmath2  simultaneously results in a cross section prediction that is very similar to the nominal prediction over a large fraction of the @xmath10 range ; this suggests that these parameters are strongly anti - correlated .",
