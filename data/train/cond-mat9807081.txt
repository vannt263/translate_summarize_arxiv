    "there are now strong reasons to believe that many of the high-@xmath3 superconductors ( hts ) exhibit a superconducting order parameter which has mainly ( or completely ) @xmath4-wave ( @xmath0-wave ) symmetry.@xcite the exact structure of the order parameter depends on the material .",
    "for instance , due to the orthorhombic character of @xmath5 ( ybco ) an @xmath6-wave component of the order parameter is induced.@xcite this is not the case for tetragonal systems like @xmath7 , where a pure @xmath4-wave symmetry has been established.@xcite at any rate , the presence of a substantial component of @xmath0-wave symmetry in the high-@xmath3 superconductors can not be ignored .",
    "this paper sets out to explore theoretically the implications of @xmath0-wave symmetry for the ac josephson effect in high-@xmath3 superconductors .    to have the ac josephson effect , two superconductors must be present on both sides of a normal ( or insulating ) region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for an anisotropic superconductor the order parameter @xmath8 depends on the angle @xmath9 of incidence of the quasiparticle approaching the junction region . in the case of pure @xmath0-wave symmetry",
    "we have @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the orientation of the @xmath0-wave order parameter with respect to the insulator .",
    "we will in this paper use the notation @xmath12 for @xmath0-wave superconductor with orientation @xmath11 . for the isotropic @xmath6-wave case , @xmath13 .",
    "another competing candidate for the order parameter of hts has been the anisotropic @xmath6-wave order parameter : @xmath14+\\delta_1 $ ] ; today , however , it does not seem to be on the short list of possible hts order parameters any longer.@xcite    the strength of the insulating barrier shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] may vary in our treatment .",
    "this makes it possible to treat all superconductor - superconductor junctions from the ballistic ( fully transparent ) superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) junction to the superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) tunnel junction . to describe superconductor - superconductor junctions in general we use the notation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the superconductor on the left ( right ) side of the interface @xmath17 .",
    "the interface is a barrier of arbitrary strength .",
    "the ac josephson effect , from a general point of view , means that for an @xmath18 junction a time independent bias voltage @xmath19 results in a time dependent current .",
    "the non - stationary current perpendicular to the junction ( the @xmath20-direction ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) can be decomposed into frequency components @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an integer .",
    "the josephson frequency @xmath23 corresponds to the energy gained by a cooper pair when passing through the junction region .",
    "since the relation @xmath24 holds , the current is real .",
    "an order parameter with @xmath4-wave symmetry changes sign when rotated @xmath1 .",
    "this feature has been shown to have several implications on transport properties of @xmath4-wave superconductors , some of which have been confirmed in experiments : cancellation effects as to the dc josephson current@xcite and the presence of zero - bias conductance peaks ( zbcp ) in various structures of hts junctions.@xcite since in this paper the focus is on the ac josephson effect we will ( among other things ) discuss issues related to zbcp .",
    "the zbcp arises due to the presence of zero - energy bound states , so - called midgap states ( mgs ) , at surfaces / interfaces of @xmath4-wave superconductors.@xcite the reason mgs appear is an interplay between normal scattering ( at the surface / interface ) and the fact that the @xmath0-wave order parameter changes sign at some regions in momentum space .",
    "since in the @xmath0-wave case the order parameter depends on momentum ( or in other words angle @xmath9 ) , a quasiparticle will in general sense a different order parameter before and after scattering ( normal scattering changes the momentum ) . when there is a sign difference of the order parameter before and after scattering a zero - energy bound state appears ( mgs).@xcite these localized zero - energy states open up additional channels for current flow , leading to peaks in the conductance .",
    "calculations of the current - voltage ( @xmath25 ) curves for the normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) junction@xcite confirmed the picture brought forward in ref .  .",
    "mgs are infinitely sharp when the transmission of the strength of the barrier is infinetely high . when the strength of the barrier decreases the mgs broaden .",
    "in addition , there are some other features related to the ac josephson effect involving @xmath0-wave superconductors that have not yet ( to our knowledge ) been experimentally established , such as negative differential conductance@xcite and cancellation of the odd ac components , doubling the josephson frequency,@xcite although there are experiments discussing related features.@xcite negative differential conductance is a result of resonant conduction through mgs.@xcite moreover , we will in this paper show an example of zbcp for the case when there are mgs on both sides of the barrier ( possible only when there are @xmath0-wave superconductors on both sides of the barrier ) .",
    "we note that for the cases we discuss zbcp appear for relatively small values of barrier strength .",
    "the geometry used in these calculations correspond to experiments just recently performed.@xcite    cancellation of the odd ac components is explained as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the keypoint is that the total current is a sum of contributions , associated with different angles @xmath9 . in the case of two @xmath0-wave superconductors with orientation angles",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , quasiparticles incident at angle @xmath28 experience a different sign of the gap @xmath29 compared to quasiparticles incident at @xmath9 .",
    "this sign difference ( which corresponds to a phase difference of @xmath30 ) enters the expression of ac components as @xmath31 , where @xmath22 is the index of the ac component in eq .",
    "( [ ac_curr_x ] ) .",
    "this means that for even ( odd ) @xmath22 , positive and negative angles add up ( cancel out).@xcite we note that the doubling of the josephson frequency is completely in line with the change of the current - phase relationship in stationary josephson junctions from being @xmath32-periodic to being @xmath30-periodic in some arrangements.@xcite    moreover , there appears in voltage - biased junctions of @xmath0-wave superconductors a possibility to have current flow parallel to the junction .",
    "this is not necessarily related to the ac josephson effect but could appear in ns junctions as well.@xcite    recently , there has been a discussion concerning the appearance of superconducting states breaking time - reversal symmetry , especially at inhomogeneities ( like surfaces / interfaces ) in @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "these states have been theoretically predicted to have an order parameter of the form @xmath33 , where the @xmath34-part is induced by the inhomogeneity and only present close to the inhomogeneity .",
    "the @xmath34-wave part of the order parameter has vital physical importance : the @xmath33 combination explicitly breaks time - reversal symmetry , and peculiar surface / interface currents appear with the existence of the @xmath34 part .",
    "one example of this phenomenon is twin boundaries of ybco , whose order parameter is of the form @xmath35 ( a real combination ) .",
    "the twin boundary divides the superconductor into two parts with different signs in front of the @xmath6-part . to match the two sides the most favorable way ( from a ginzburg - landau theoretical point of view ) , close to the boundary a complex order parameter appears in order to avoid a discontinous change in the phase between the @xmath6- and @xmath0-part of the order parameter.@xcite this result",
    "has also been found within a green s function formalism@xcite and by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation.@xcite another example is the surface of a @xmath0-wave superconductor , where the surface lowers the symmetry in such a way that a combination of the subdominant @xmath6 and the dominant @xmath0 order parameters are now allowed at temperatures below a certain temperature defined by various properties , giving rise to a @xmath33 surface state with associated time - reversal symmetry breaking currents parallel to the surface.@xcite these surface states are doubly degenerate , corresponding to two opposite current directions .",
    "a third example ( and most closely related to the case studied in this paper ) is the junction between an @xmath6-wave superconductor and a @xmath4-wave superconductor rotated @xmath36,@xcite where a combination of @xmath6- and @xmath0-waves coexists close to the junction area . again",
    "the phase difference of the energetically stable phase is such that a @xmath37 order parameter appears , also this time doubly degenerate corresponding to phase differences of @xmath38 between the @xmath6- and @xmath0-wave side . the same effect has theoretically been found in junctions between two @xmath4 superconductors where one of the superconductors is rotated by @xmath39.@xcite    all the examples discussed above concern the stationary state .",
    "this is definitely different from our case with a voltage present between the two sides of the junction.@xcite in fact , when the junction is voltage - biased it does not care about the ground state phase difference between the two sides .",
    "rather , all possible phases are taking part in an averaging procedure .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the case discussed in ref .   ( the third example in the previous paragraph ) does not produce parallel current density for the zero - frequency ac component in the voltage - biased case , since the two degenerate states ( corresponding to two opposite current directions ) are now averaged to produce a zero net dc current density . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the mechanism in the voltage biased case for the net current density parallel to the interface between the two sides .",
    "the bottomline is that a @xmath4-wave order parameter with orientation angle @xmath40 treats quasiparticles associated with positive injection angles differently than quasiparticles associated with negative injection angles , leading to an imbalance between current contributions associated with positive and negative injection angles .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider the ac josephson effect and focus on three main issues : first , current - voltage curves of @xmath0-wave @xmath15 junctions ; second , the disappearance of the odd ac components ; third , the current density parallel to the junction direction .",
    "moreover , we give a fairly complete account of the methods used.@xcite especially , we elaborate on how various ways of writing down current formulas relate to each other .    in the case of @xmath6-wave superconductivity eq .",
    "( [ ac_curr_x ] ) has been studied for a long time . in the tunneling limit ( low transmission of the insulating barrier ) detailed calculations@xcite showed excellent agreement with experimental results for the conventional @xmath6-wave superconductors .",
    "these calculations used the tunneling hamiltonian method . due to the huge success of the tunneling calculations",
    "less attention was paid to the non - tunneling case .",
    "the work by blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk proved that with fairly simple methods it was possible to produce current - voltage curves of ns junctions for any barrier strength.@xcite later , another line of research focused on introducing the concept of mesoscopics into superconductivity.@xcite both the dc josephson effect@xcite and the ac josephson effect@xcite were studied , again without the tunneling - limit restriction",
    ".    the main tool in many of these papers dealing with the case of arbitrary transmission has been the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation.@xcite the time - dependent bdg equation together with a formula for the current gives a complete description of the current in both the stationary and non - stationary case . in this paper",
    "we use a generalization@xcite of the methods worked out for the @xmath6-wave case.@xcite    when an electron with subgap energy from a normal region approaches the superconductor , there seems to be no way of transmitting electric charge into the superconductor : there are no propagating states of the superconductor in the subgap region .",
    "this becomes evident when solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation resulting in decaying wave functions when solving for subgap energies.@xcite    however , there is one important physical process making transmission of electric charge possible also for subgap incidence : andreev reflection ( ar).@xcite in this process an electron ( from a normal region ) with subgap energy incident on a superconductor is reflected as a hole moving in the opposite direction to the original electron .",
    "this event does obviously not in itself conserve particles .",
    "therefore , a cooper pair of electrons is injected into the superconductor .",
    "when two superconductors embrace the normal region , forming an sns junction , the hole will finally hit the other superconductor and again andreev reflects , this time as an electron .",
    "these ar s will continue back and forth in the normal region .",
    "since the voltage drop is over the normal region , the electrons and holes gain the energy @xmath41 every time they pass the normal region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "these repeated reflections are usually named multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) .",
    "the reflections are perfect inside the gap but decrease in strength when the magnitude of the excitation energy is increased away from the gap region .    for each round trip two ar s transform the original electron into an electron at an energy @xmath42 higher than from the start .",
    "this means that the wave functions contain parts ( sidebands ) separated by multiples of @xmath42 from each other , leading to an ac current with a frequency of @xmath43 as seen in eq .",
    "( [ ac_curr_x ] ) .",
    "we think fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is a key figure in order to illustrate the underlying physical mechanism of the phenomenon dicussed in this paper ( the ac josephson effect ) : it makes clear the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ ac_curr_x ] ) .",
    "there are two scattering events of our problem : first , normal scattering at the barrier described by a transmission amplitude ; second , ar at the ns interfaces described by an ar amplitude . therefore , eq",
    ".  ( [ ac_curr_x ] ) can be thought of as an expansion in transmission amplitude ( through the barrier ) and ar amplitude .",
    "higher orders of the wave function corresponding to sidebands visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] contain higher orders of transmission through the barrier and higher orders of ar .",
    "the present paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ sec_2 ]",
    "we outline the model , which is used in section  [ sec_3 ] to calculate the various ac components of the current .",
    "we present the results in section  [ sec_4 ] , and conclude with a summary in section  [ sec_5 ] .",
    "we feel that an important part of our paper is given in the appendices : in appendix  [ app_a ] the time - dependent bdg equation is solved , and we also give some numerical advice on how to calculate the current ; in appendix  [ app_b ] we compare how various current formulas previously used in the literature relate to each other ; in appendix  [ app_c ] we point out a couple of symmetry relations that are relevant to our problem ; finally , in appendix  [ app_d ] we write down a pair of analytical expressions describing the ballistic case .",
    "to mathematically describe the voltage - biased @xmath15 system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have made a number of assumptions , some of them pertaining to the superconducting parts of the system and some of them pertaining to the normal part of the system . in the following we detail these assumptions .",
    "starting with the normal part ( the junction ) in between the superconductors , we assume a planar structure with translational invariance in the @xmath44-direction .",
    "the planar geometry is a necessary condition for mgs to exist , contrary to the case of point contacts@xcite where no mgs are around .",
    "moreover , we neglect in our treatment any influence from interface roughness . in the normal region",
    "we only take into account scattering due to the barrier , which is modeled as a one - particle potential @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46-function form of @xmath47 results in a reflection amplitude @xmath48 and a transmission amplitude @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51.@xcite the parameter @xmath50 describes the strength of the barrier : @xmath52 corresponds to no scattering at all ( ballistic case ) ; @xmath53 corresponds to the case when the two sides of the junction are uncoupled ( no @xmath20-current in this case ) ; a high value of @xmath50 corresponds to the tunneling case .",
    "next we consider the superconducting parts . in our calculation self - consistency",
    "is not fulfilled . in the literature",
    "there is work that has included self - consistency in the tunneling limit showing that non - zero energy states appear along with mgs.@xcite in our work we neglect these effects ; on the other hand , we allow the barrier strength @xmath50 of the barrier to have any value .",
    "therefore , we assume that the superconducting order parameter of the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is @xmath54 since the overall phase is unimportant we can here choose @xmath55 real .",
    "there may be a phase - difference @xmath56 over the junction which we defer to the right - hand superconductor .",
    "the angle @xmath9 corresponds to the angle of incidence of the quasiparticle approaching the superconductor . in the following",
    "we will use various forms of order parameters for @xmath57 and @xmath58 ranging from the @xmath6-wave case to the @xmath0-wave case .",
    "the @xmath0-wave superconductors are allowed to be rotated an angle @xmath11 measured relative to the interface normal as described in fig .",

    "the magnetic field will screen any current on the length scale of the london penetration depth , forcing the current to flow next to surfaces / interfaces of superconductors . neglecting screening effects",
    "is traditionally considered valid if the system under study has dimensions smaller than the london penetration depth . however",
    ", a finite system immediately raises questions about where the parallel current finally ends up . in this paper",
    "we do not address this question ; instead we just note that a full treatment including screening effects will be required to understand how the parallel current is guided close to the interface of the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "using the models discussed above for both the normal and the superconducting regions we solve the time - dependent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation for anisotropic superconductors @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the chemical potential , and @xmath61 is the order parameter . introducing a voltage the chemical potentials of the two reservoirs will be shifted relative to each other , @xmath62 .",
    "the natural energy reference level in a superconductor is the chemical potential . in order to establish a global energy reference level ,",
    "a gauge transformation is performed as described in detail in ref .  .",
    "as a result of this transformation a phase difference appears over the junction obeying the josephson relation @xmath63 . in other words , for our case with constant voltage we describe this time - dependent phase difference multiplying @xmath58 by @xmath64 .    in appendix  [ app_a ]",

    "( [ currentdensity ] ) in a way outlined below .",
    "we start by studying the current density @xmath71 perpendicular to the junction .",
    "since we consider a structure smaller than the london penetration depth ( allowing us to neglect self - field effects ) the current density will distribute uniformly over the junction .",
    "therefore we may calculate the current density at any @xmath44-coordinate .",
    "moreover , a conservation law for the current density assures that we may calculate @xmath71 at any @xmath20-coordinate ; it proves convenient to calculate the current density in the normal region ( in our treatment to the left of the barrier in fig .",

    "we discuss @xmath131 and @xmath132 for some configurations of superconductors .",
    "we will in this section present curves only for positive voltage : in appendix  [ app_c ] we show that the current is odd in voltage .",
    "we start by discussing the results for the @xmath111 term of the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ac_curr_x ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we have plotted the @xmath25 curves for different values of the temperature . for zero temperature there is a peak in the current for some orientations due to resonant transport through mgs.@xcite this feature ( resulting in negative differential conductance ) is especially pronounced for arrangements where one superconductor is an @xmath6-wave superconductor and the other one is a @xmath0-wave superconductor with orientation angle @xmath133 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a)-(b ) we study how temperature influences the current peak appearing at a voltage @xmath134 .",
    "we find that the peak is rather robust up to relatively high temperatures , such as @xmath135 shown in the figure , where @xmath136 is the critical temperature of the @xmath6-wave superconductor . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we have taken into account the fact that the @xmath6-wave superconducting gap is reduced when the temperature is increased according to the theory by bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer.@xcite this is the reason for the shift of the peak towards lower voltage when the temperature is increased .",
    "the @xmath0-wave order parameter , on the other hand , is assumed not to be affected by the temperature variations , since @xmath3 for hts compounds in general is considerably higher compared to conventional superconductors .",
    "it is interesting to compare with the ns junction,@xcite where it has been found that the presence of mgs induces a dramatic increase of current for low voltage resulting in zbcp .",
    "this structure is more sensitive to temperature than the current peak of the @xmath137-junction discussed in the paragraph above .",
    "the reason for this greater sensitivity is the density of states : it is well known that mgs are located at the fermi energy on the @xmath0-wave side .",
    "this means that quasiparticles incident from the normal side will reach mgs for any small voltage .",
    "this , however , is in great contrast to the @xmath137-case , where mgs on the @xmath0-wave side may only be reached from the @xmath6-wave side at a voltage greater than @xmath138 simply because the superconducting density of states is zero for subgap energies .",
    "the conclusion is therefore that the ns case will be more affected by thermal smearing introduced by the fermi functions , since this smearing is centralized around the fermi energy .",
    "this argument breaks down at temperatures larger than the @xmath6-wave gap , taking place close to @xmath3 of the @xmath6-wave superconductor .",

    "[ fig5 ] , the curves of ( ii ) are not easily understood from our calculations .",
    "the critical point for not having agreement is the fact that in ( ii ) there is no opening of the superconducting @xmath6-wave gap corresponding to the pb electrode to be found .",
    "very recently an investigation of zbcp in bicrystal grain boundary junctions have appeared,@xcite discussing ( among other things ) a geometry corresponding to @xmath139 , in which zbcp was found . in our calculations zbcp can only be found in rather transparent ( small @xmath50 ) @xmath140 junctions , as shown in fig  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the reason for this is that the scattering states start from the bulk where there are no superconducting density of states close to zero energy except for angles corresponding to the gap nodes of the @xmath0-wave superconductor . for small voltage",
    ", the mgs can only be reached by the scattering states from those angles , making the mgs contribution very limited in the angle average .",
    "broadening of mgs due to reduced barrier height @xmath50 ( which is incorporated in our treatment from the start ) increases the range of angles from which the scattering states may reach mgs . for low barrier height the width of the mgs becomes comparable to the gap making the junction ballistic@xcite for scattering states starting near the gap edges , allowing mar to contribute massively to the current .",
    "the current then takes a finite value for small voltage and a huge zbcp appears .",
    "it is important to have mgs on both sides of the barrier for this effect ; otherwise , the number of ar will be reduced , resulting in a smaller current contribution .",
    "[ fig6 ] demonstrates that at a barrier strength @xmath141 , corresponding to an averaged transparancy @xmath142 , the zbcp has disappeared within our model : for this barrier strength the width of the mgs is not high enough to give large current at small voltage .",
    "a related issue is the case @xmath143 discussed in ref .  .",
    "also in this case a combination of broadened mgs on both sides of the barrier and mar give rise to zbcp for small ( e. g. @xmath144 ) barrier strengths , although the peak is not as sharp as for @xmath145 .",
    "as explained above there are no scattering states at zero energy except for the angles corresponding to the gap nodes .",
    "since for the orientation @xmath143 the gap nodes are geometrically lined up against each other , the influence of mgs will be less dramatic compared to the case discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "an interesting paper , mainly on calculations in the tunneling limit , introduces phenomenologically an imaginary part of the energy , corresponding to broadening of the mgs.@xcite ( in our calculation there is no imaginary part of the energy . ) due to the imaginary part zbcp was found in the case @xmath143.@xcite the difference compared to our work is that in our work the broadening is not introduced phenomenologically ; contrary , it is microscopically described in terms of reduced strength of the barrier .    we now continue to discuss the @xmath112 ac current components of eq .",

    "these qualitative properties carry over to the non - ballistic case in a straightforward manner .",

    "we start by discussing @xmath147 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot the magnitude @xmath115 of the ac components .",

    "[ fig7](b ) and ( e ) .",
    "the detailed explanation for this effect is given in appendix  [ app_c ] and is good for any value of @xmath50 .",
    "the main point is that the current is calculated from an integration over angles @xmath9 , where the integrand is composed of two functions .",

    "we note in passing that the @xmath111 component has a finite current in the limit @xmath150 as discussed in appendix  [ app_d ] .",

    "the fine structure in fig .

    "[ fig9 ] we plot the dependence of the large - voltage limit of the parallel current density on the barrier strength @xmath50 .",

    "[ fig3 ] we see that the largest gap will be at positive angles in this case , implying a positive current since @xmath154 is positive for positive angles .",
    "in addition , the normal scattering will introduce contributions from the gap @xmath156 at the expense of @xmath29 .",
    "one can show that for the @xmath157 junction the relation @xmath158 holds for all @xmath50 , implying that the introduction of @xmath159 gives contributions with the positive sign .",

    "an important limitation of the present work is that we do not include magnetic field . from a calculation with a self - consistent magnetic field",
