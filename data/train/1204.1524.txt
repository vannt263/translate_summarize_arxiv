    "the canonical quantization and the path integral quantization of gravity are two well - known but old proposals which attempted to quantize gravity and to unify the general relativity with the laws of quantum mechanics . however , from field theoretical approach , the theory of relativity is not renormalizable and results in the ultraviolet divergences . indeed , beyond the planck energy scale , the effects of gravity are so important which could lead to discreteness of the very spacetime .",
    "this is due to the fact that when we probe small distances with high energies , the spacetime structure will be significantly disturbed by the gravitational effects .",
    "however , we can solve the normalizability problem of gravity by introducing a minimal measurable length as an effective cutoff in the ultraviolet domain .",
    "various candidates of quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity and quantum geometry all agree on the existence of a minimum observable length . in the language of the string theory , a string can not probe distances smaller than its length . moreover ,",
    "some gedanken experiments in black - hole physics and noncommutative geometry imply a minimal length of the order of the planck length @xmath0 where @xmath1 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "for instance , since in string theory the mass of a string is proportional to its length , they expand in size when probed at sufficiently high energies .",
    "this suggests an additional momentum dependent uncertainty in the position of a string in the form of @xcite ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a dimensionless constant . in order to incorporate the idea of the minimal length into quantum mechanics",
    ", we need to change the heisenberg uncertainty principle to the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) .",
    "the introduction of this idea has attracted much attention in recent years and many papers have appeared in the literature to address the effects of gup on various quantum mechanical systems @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested to find exact coherent states of the harmonic oscillator in the framework of the generalized commutation relation in the form @xmath5=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^{2})$ ] where @xmath6 is the gup parameter .",
    "note that the problem of the gup - corrected harmonic oscillator is exactly solvable in the momentum space and its exact energy eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions are obtained in refs .",
    "moreover , the perturbative construction of the corresponding coherent states is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite to first - order of the gup parameter . here ,",
    "following klauder s approach and using the formally self - adjoint representation of the deformed commutation relation , we take the hamiltonian as a generator of the generalized heisenberg algebra and find the exact form of the coherent states , weight functions , normalization coefficients , and probability distributions .",
    "we show that the entropy of the system reduces in the gup scenario as a consequence of the minimal observable length and we explain the physical reasoning behind this phenomenon .",
    "the connection between our results and the recent progresses in probing planck - scale physics with quantum optics is discussed finally .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty relation asserts that we can measure the position and momentum of a particle separately with arbitrary precision .",
    "so if there is a absolute minimal value for the results of the measurements , the heisenberg uncertainty relation should be modified .",
    "here we consider a generalized uncertainty principle which implies a minimum observable length @xmath7\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the gup parameter .",
    "we also have @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the planck mass and @xmath10 is of the order of unity .",
    "gups of this type also arise from polymer quantization @xcite .",
    "note that the deviation from the heisenberg picture takes place in the high energy domain where the effects of gravity would be significant .",
    "thus , for the energies much lower than the planck energy @xmath11 gev , we recover the well - known heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "it is easy to check that the above inequality relation ( [ gup ] ) implies the existence of an absolute minimum observable length given by @xmath12 . in the context of string theory",
    ", we can interpret this length as the length of the string and conclude that the string s length is proportional to the square root of the gup parameter .",

    "the exact gup - corrected energy spectrum is given by @xmath49 the generalization of this problem to arbitrary dimension is also discussed in ref .",
    "coherent states were originally introduced by schrdinger in 1926 @xcite have applications in many areas of physics @xcite . to construct coherent states , we follow klauder s approach @xcite and use the version of the generalized heisenberg algebra ( gha ) @xcite given in refs .",

    "it is worth to mention that a potential application of our results is in quantum optics . indeed",

    "[ fig1 ] ) and using @xmath115 eq .  ( [ n ! ] ) reads @xmath116 so eq .",

    "( [ p2 ] ) is expressed as @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the schematic behavior of the probability distribution for the gup - corrected harmonic oscillator and for various values of the gup parameter .",
    "as the figure shows , @xmath119 which gives the maximum probability , decreases as @xmath84 increases and is given by the root of the following equation : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is @xmath30th harmonic number , @xmath122 is @xmath30th harmonic number of order @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is euler s constant .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) and ( [ p-2 ] ) define the probability of detecting @xmath37 photons in a laser beam subject to ( [ p - sub ] ) which is a result of the deformed generalized uncertainty relation ( expected to be significant at very high energies where gravity is considerable ) .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath125 , the averaged number of photons decreases as the gup parameter increases .    the probability distribution for the gup - corrected harmonic oscillator .",
    "we set @xmath126 ( @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) and @xmath129.,width=302 ]    now we can define the entropy of this system as the logarithmic measure of the density of states : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the boltzmann constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have depicted the entropy of the gup - corrected harmonic oscillator for @xmath132 .",
    "as the figure shows , for fixed @xmath125 , the entropy decreases as @xmath84 increases and tends to the poisson entropy for @xmath85 @xmath133.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reason behind this behavior can be understood from the gup commutation relation ( [ gupc ] ) .",
    "indeed , we can consider the right hand side of this equation effectively as the gup - corrected planck s constant which is always greater than @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , in the language of the statistical mechanics , the size of the unit cell in the phase space increases and consequently the number of the accessible states and the entropy of the system decrease with respect to the absence of gup .",
    "the entropy of the gup - corrected harmonic oscillator for @xmath132.,width=302 ]    as we state before , a potential application of our calculations is in quantum optics .",
    "but the question is : could the relation between quantum optics and plank - scale uncertainty relations have some detectable effects",
    "? to answer this question we should mention that in recent years various approaches are developed to test the effects of quantum gravity and to explore possible quantum gravitational phenomena .",
    "these attempts range from astronomical observations @xcite to table - top experiments @xcite .",
    "amelino - camelia and lammerzahl proposed some laser interferometric setups to explain puzzling observations of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in the context of quantum gravity modified laws of particle propagation @xcite .",
    "the implications of high intensity laser projects for quantum gravity phenomenology are also discussed by magueijo based on deformed special relativity @xcite .",
    "recently , pikovski _",
    "et al . _ have introduced a scheme to experimentally test the existence of a minimal length scale as a modification of the heisenberg uncertainty relation for various gup scenarios in the context of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "they utilized quantum optical control to probe possible deviations from the quantum commutation relation at the planck scale and showed that their scheme is within reach of current technology .",
    "in fact , the idea is direct measurement of the canonical commutator of a massive object using a quantum optical ancillary system that produces nonlinear enhancement without need for planck - scale accuracy of position measurements .",
    "so the possible planck - scale commutator deformations can be observed with very high accuracy by optical interferometric techniques that are within experimental reach .",
    "these experimental progresses support the implication of our calculations which could shed light on possible detectable planck - scale effects with quantum optics .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the construction of the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle which implies a minimal length uncertainty proportional to the planck length .",
    "following klauder s approach , we constructed the generalized heisenberg algebra where the hamiltonian was its formally self - adjoint generator .",
    "then , after finding the characteristic function of the algebra , we obtained the exact expression for the coherent states , weight functions , normalization coefficients , and probability distributions and studied their behavior in terms of the gup parameter .",
    "we showed that because of the gravitational uncertainty relation the ordinary quantum description of laser light should be modified and the poisson probability distribution will not be exactly preserved . also , the entropy of the system decreased in the presence of the minimal length uncertainty due to the increase of the size of the unit cell in the phase space .",
    "finally , we indicated that recent progresses to experimentally test the existence of a minimal length scale could reveal some evidence of possible quantum gravitational effects .",
