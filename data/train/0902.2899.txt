    "inhomogeneous models of the universe have gradually become more popular among cosmologists .",
    "although we know quite a lot of different inhomogeneous solutions ( e.g. kramer et al . 1980 , krasiski 1993 ) the most famous and strongly investigated models of this general class have been the spherically symmetric dust tolman universes ( tolman 1934 , bondi 1947 , bonnor 1974 ) .",
    "their properties have been studied quite thoroughly by hellaby and lake ( 1984 , 1985 ) , hellaby ( 1987 , 1988 ) and the observational relations for them were studied by goicoechea and martin - mirones ( 1986 ) , moffat and tatarski ( 1992 ) .",
    "recently , we have considered the global properties of the spherically symmetric stephani universes ( dabrowski 1993 ) .",
    "a couple of exact inhomogeneous solutions have been found and the question arises how far from the real universe these solutions can be .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give the observational relations that could enable us to compare these solutions with astronomical observations of galaxies and quasars .",
    "generally , in inhomogeneous models the density and ( or ) pressure depend on spatial coordinates .",
    "the density in the tolman models is non - uniform . by this",
    "we mean that it depends on both the time and the radial coordinate . on the other hand",
    "the pressure is uniform and it only depends on the time coordinate . in the stephani models it is quite different -",
    "the density is uniform and the pressure is non - uniform .",
    "although it seems to be easier to think about non - uniform density in the universe , the non - uniform pressure could still have some motivation in inflationary cosmology , at least in the very early stages of the universe when the vacuum pressure plays an important role ( vilenkin 1985 , weinberg 1989 , linde 1994 ) .",
    "the stephani models have also been studied in the context of thermodynamics by sussman ( 1994 ) , quevedo and sussman ( 1994a , b )",
    ".    some other possibilities of admitting inhomogeneities in the universe have been studied , among others , by roeder ( 1975 ) , dyer ( 1979 ) , partovi and mashhoon ( 1984 ) .",
    "some observational quantities for these models have also been found .    in this paper",
    "we shortly comment on the stephani models in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we present a formula for the redshift in model i ( mi ) and model ii ( mii ) which have been fully considered in the earlier paper ( dabrowski 1993 ) . in section 4",
    "we use the kristian - sachs method ( kristian and sachs 1966 ) to derive the redshift - magnitude relations for mi and mii . in section 5",
    "we present numerical results for the redshift - magnitude relation both for centrally and non - centrally placed observers . in the appendix",
    "a we write down the components of the null tangent vector to zero geodesic equations and solve them in a couple of cases . in the appendix",
    "b we present a redshift - magnitude relation for a radial ray in the general spherically symmetric stephani universe .",

    "the mass density and pressure are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this means that the density is uniform while the pressure is non - uniform throughout the stephani universe .",
    "the four - velocity of matter has only one nonvanishing component @xmath12 and the only nonvanishing component of the acceleration is @xmath13 and @xmath14  .    in this paper",
    "we will be considering only two subcases of the model ( 2.1 ) , which possess the flat friedman limit , so the comparison with the isotropic data seems to be very easy for them .",
    "we will be called these subcases model i ( mi ) and model ii ( mii ) , respectively .",
    "these models admit a friedman - like time coordinate @xmath15 in which the expansion scalar is simply @xmath16 . for the model",

    "if it is a galaxy at the centre @xmath44 and the observer is away from it , the redshift of the galaxy measured by the observer is smaller than in the corresponding friedman model ( 3.3 ) .",

    "one can easily notice that unlikely to the case of the centrally placed observer the constant @xmath24 effects the redshift - magnitude relation as well .",
    "in fact , it is the constant which appears in the flat dust - filled friedman limit of the stephani universe @xmath30 ( cf.(2.15 ) ) and it has the same dimension . in the friedman model",
    "its value is @xmath113 for @xmath114 i.e. @xmath115",
    ". from the figures 3 - 5 we can see that for strongly non - centrally placed observers the redshift - magnitude relation ( for fixed @xmath111 ) becomes more and more asymmetric .",
    "the smallest apparent magnitude is for the galaxies for which the angle @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and they are just behind the centre of symmetry with respect to the observer . the largest apparent magnitude is achieved for @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) and the galaxies are in front of the centre of symmetry with respect to the observer . for the sake of comparison",

    "this suggests one of the ways to explain the well - known noncompatibility of the theoretical curve with the observational data for large redshift galaxies in the friedman universe .",
    "however , we emphasize that we do not take any evolutionary effects into account here .     +     +     +",
    "the comparison of the models mi and mii with astronomical data requires a couple of conditions which have to be satisfied . for small redshift objects there should not be any problem because our models deviate in a very clear way from the flat friedman universes but some difficulty might be related to a position of the centre of symmetry from the observer ( cf . goicoechea and martin - mirones 1987 ) . also , for some choices of the stephani parameters the singularities of pressure may appear ( cf .",
    "dabrowski 1993 ) . for large redshift galaxies and quasars",
    "the problem appears since the kristian - sachs method of section 4 generally valids if suitable series for observational quantities are convergent .",
    "it seems to happen in the cases considered in this paper , but in general it might not be so .",
    "of course we have still some freedom of a choice of functions @xmath109 and @xmath121 ( cf .",
    "( 2.2)-(2.4 ) ) in order to make the series convergent . on the other hand for large redshift objects the evolutionary effects ought to be taken into account .",
    "of course the full information about the series can be obtained by calculating the second and higher order corrections to m(z ) in ( 4.1 ) , but the result contains the second and higher covariant derivatives of ( 4.2 ) ( i.e. @xmath122 - see ellis and maccallum ( 1970 ) ) and the final formula is much more complicated than the formulas ( 4.24)-(4.27 ) .",
