    "these transitions can be understood by simple geometric analysis of the bending energy .    in our simulations , the number of protein on the membrane is fixed . in typical experimental condition",
    ", the proteins are inserted from the bulk so that the protein density on the membrane is determined by the balance of the chemical potentials .",
    "thus , in experiments , the protein density may discretely change accompanied by the shape transition between the polygonal tubes ( or pohyhedral vesicles ) .",
    "the polygonal tubes with more faces can be adsorbed by more proteins .",
    "the drastic change of the the protein density may indicate a shape transition .",
    "polygonal tubes and polyhedral membrane shapes are often observed experimentally .",
    "regular arrays of triangular prismatic tubes are observed in the inner membranes of the mitochondria in astrocytes.@xcite the formation mechanism of these triangular tubes is not known .",
    "our simulation study suggests that these prismatic tubes can be generated by the assembly of the bar proteins .    in the presented simulation conditions",
    ", tubulation is not obtained .",
    "tubulation is likely prevented by the high bending energy at the tip of the membrane tubule , resulting in linear rod aggregation at the edges of the polyhedra .",
    "the addition of the spontaneous curvature of the membrane induces tubule formation.@xcite in living cells , the tubules and discoidal membranes are often connected .",
    "endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) consists of flat discoidal membranes ( rough er ) with branched tubular network ( smooth er ) .",
    "it is an interesting problem to clarify the control mechanism of tubules and discoidal membranes for further studies .",
