    "here we suggest that the central 0.2pc around sgr  a@xmath1  are not mass - depleted , but dominated by a cusp of sbhs having displaced the less massive visible stars : due to dynamical friction , the most massive stellar remnants sink into the depth of the smbh s potential well .",

    "thus , the observed break radius is further evidence for a canonical imf and a moderate black hole fraction in the galactic centre .",
    "observations of the galactic centre revealed one or two discs of @xmath103myr old stars orbiting the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) at a distance of @xmath104pc ( @xcite ; see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "two main scenarios have been proposed for the formation of such massive ( @xmath105 ) discs close to sgr  a@xmath1 : @xcite suggested that a disc of stars may have formed by tidal disruption of an infalling cluster of young stars , which would require a large mass or a central intermediate - mass black hole to survive the strong tidal forces from the smbh @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that this can not explain the small distances of the stars from sgr  a@xmath1 , and propose in - situ formation by fragmentation of a massive accretion disc as an alternative scenario ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite and",

    "however , in @xcite we show that a canonical imf can not be excluded from disc dynamics : @xcite used stellar discs only out to 0.2pc from the smbh , while more than one third of the stars listed by @xcite are further away from sgr  a@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , they did not distinguish between stars in the outer parts of the discs which almost retain their orbital planes , and stars close to the centre which strongly precess .",
    "@xcite argue that the x - ray luminosity of the sgr  a@xmath1  field is too low to account for the number of young @xmath107 stars expected from a canonical imf , considering the large number of o - stars observed in the discs , which may be explained by a higher low - mass cutoff near 1 . on the other hand , the existence of the s - stars within 0.01pc from sgr  a@xmath1  is in favour of a canonical imf ( and thus a large number of b - type stars ) for the stellar discs , if they were formed from these discs as suggested by @xcite . for a more detailed discussion of the imf of the young stellar discs ,",
    "see @xcite .    assuming an infalling cluster as the origin for the stellar discs",
    ", one may expect a top - heavy mass function if the cluster was mass segregated and then tidally stripped . on the other hand , a top - heavy _ initial _ mass function of stars formed in a fragmenting disc would require an unusual mode of star formation .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous sections , no convincing reason or evidence for a flat imf in the galactic centre in general has been found .",
    "using sph simulations of star formation in fragmenting gas accretion discs , @xcite find that the imf of disc stars can be bimodal ( and thus top - heavy ) if the infalling gas cloud is massive enough ( @xmath108 ) and the impact parameter of the smbh encounter is as small as @xmath109pc .",
    "this way , an extreme configuration of cloud masses and distances may lead to a significant variation of the imf .    only recently ,",
    "a systematic search of ob stars in the central parsec revealed a significant deficit of b - type stars in the regime of the young discs , suggesting a strongly top - heavy imf for these discs @xcite . until then",
    ", there was no strong evidence for a top - heavy imf in the young discs .",
    "however , it can not be assumed that the majority of stars in the galactic centre were formed the same way as the young disc stars , whose existence may be an indication of recently enhanced star formation processes : if the galactic bar is young , as an increased fraction of barred galaxies for lower redshifts suggests @xcite , bar - induced gas inflow may explain such an enhancement by an increasing supply of high - mass gmcs towards the central region ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hence , despite the significant lack of b - stars in the range @xmath110pc from the smbh , suggesting that the young discs indeed formed following a flat imf , this does not imply that star formation in the galactic centre is or was in general top - heavy .",
    "instead , the mass function of disc stars may reveal details of the formation scenario , as the results of @xcite suggest .",
    "the majority of old stars in the region may thus have formed under different conditions ( e.g.  mass and impact parameter of the infalling clouds ) in the scenario of a fragmenting disc , or formed further away and then migrated to the centre ( as in the infalling cluster scenario , see above ) , or formed by any other process following the canonical imf .",
    "various attempts have been made to study star formation in the galactic centre , but so far neither theory or simulations nor observations led to an agreement on the ( initial ) distribution of stellar masses .",
    "here we have shown that theory and observations are consistent with star formation generally following a canonical imf @xcite in the galactic centre , just as anywhere else in the universe .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of the central parsec of the milky way is consistent with a constant or exponentially decreasing star formation rate following a canonical imf .",
    "models of constant star formation following an imf with @xmath111 are consistent with the observed luminosities but create @xmath112 sbhs in the central parsec , ten times more than expected by other authors .",
    "mass functions flatter than @xmath113 can be safely ruled out , since they can not explain the observed number of bright stars and the diffuse light .",
    "the core observed in the luminosity distribution with a radius of @xmath114pc does not imply a core in the mass profile , but can be well explained by mass segregation as suggested by @xcite , where dark remnants mass - dominate this region .",
    "again , the observations are best explained by a canonical imf , and are not compatible with star formation following a top - heavy imf with @xmath115 , as this would create a core radius one order of magnitude larger .",
    "recent observations revealing a deficit of b - type stars in the young stellar discs suggest a top - heavy imf for this population , which may be explained by tidal stripping of an infalling mass - segregated cluster , or unusual modes of star formation in a fragmenting accretion disc .",
    "however , these results do not allow conclusions on star formation in the galactic centre in general , for which we have no reason to assume it to be non - canonical .    while other authors generally predicted a flat imf ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a higher low - mass cut - off ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from state - of - the - art theoretical star formation models of the galactic centre , we find that observations suggest star formation follows a canonical imf even under the extreme circumstances present in the central cluster .",
    "this universality of the imf poses a major challenge to our understanding of star formation processes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our results rely on the assumption that the stars observed within 1pc from the galactic centre also formed there , suggesting star formation with a canonical imf even under such exotic conditions .",
    "it is possible that some of the stars were brought in by massive star clusters which spiralled towards the smbh through dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario is unlikely because a star cluster is stripped on its way towards the centre and loses mostly low - mass stars , since it would be in a mass segregated state soon after its formation .",
    "therefore , the most likely scenario is a central cluster that formed over a hubble time with a canonical imf , where the very young stellar population of the stellar discs observed to have a very top - heavy imf @xcite constitutes a rare star formation event not typical for the bulk stellar population in the central cluster .",
