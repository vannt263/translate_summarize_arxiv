    "the dynamo model proposed by roberts 1972 @xcite has been chosen as the starting point for an experimental demonstration of homogeneous fluid dynamo at the forschungszentrum karlsruhe @xcite . the fluid velocity field considered by roberts which is of particular interest in this context",
    "is given by @xmath0 here a cartesian coordinate system @xmath1 is used .",
    "the flow pattern is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : roberts ] .",
    "@xmath2 is the length of the diagonal of a cell in the @xmath3plane and the parameter @xmath4 , which is a constant , determines the @xmath5component of the flow and so the helicity of the velocity field .",
    "roberts has demonstrated that a flow of this kind is capable of dynamo action .",
    "he investigated , however , only magnetic fields which show the same periodicity in @xmath6 and @xmath7 as the flow pattern .",
    "these fields , which we call here  harmonic fields \" , possess parts which do not depend on @xmath6 and @xmath7 but only on @xmath5 or , in other words , they have infinite wave lengths in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions .",
    "as roberts himself pointed out the considered flow allows also non  decaying magnetic fields with finite wave lengths in all directions . for a particular case",
    "such fields were investigated by tilgner and busse @xcite , who called them  subharmonic \" , and in a more general frame by plunian and rdler @xcite . despite the finite dimensions of the karlsruhe experimental device many estimates concerning excitation conditions etc .",
    "have been made on the basis of findings about harmonic magnetic fields .",
    "it is , however , of high interest to compare these results with such derived from results on subharmonic fields .    in this paper",
    "we start with the basic equations of the roberts dynamo problem and some general consequences ( section [ robdyn ] ) , present some findings on its harmonic solutions ( section [ harm ] ) and explain a mean  field approach to the dynamo problem on that level ( section [ mfappr ] ) .",
    "after that we turn to subharmonic solutions and give some results for them ( section [ sec : sub model ] ) .",
    "we then deal with the karlsruhe experiment , derive in the framework of a mean  field approach and under simplifying assumptions on the dynamo module an excitation condition and compare it with a corresponding result of the subharmonic analysis ( section [ sec : applkar ] ) .",
    "finally summarize the main consequences of our findings ( section [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "to discuss the roberts dynamo problem in some detail we consider the induction equation governing the magnetic field @xmath8 , assuming that it applies in all infinite space .",
    "we use its dimensionless form @xmath9 with @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 we have introduced here dimensionless coordinates @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 , instead of @xmath14 the dimensionless velocity @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 , and we measure the time in units of @xmath17 . further @xmath18 is the magnetic reynolds number defined by @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the magnetic diffusivity of the fluid .    for a steady flow",
    "as envisaged here we may expect solutions @xmath8 varying like @xmath21 in time , where the real part of @xmath22 is the dimensionless growth rate . in this case an eigenvalue problem for @xmath8 with the eigenvalue parameter @xmath22 occurs .",
    "furthermore , since the flow is @xmath23-independent , @xmath8 can be assumed to possess the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a complex vector field independent of @xmath23 , and @xmath26 a dimensionless wave number with respect to the @xmath23-direction .",
    "when inserting ( [ eq : bb ] ) into ( [ inductiondim ] ) we find @xmath27 @xmath28 the @xmath29 and @xmath30 components of ( [ eq : bharm ] ) are equations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 which do not contain @xmath33 .",
    "they constitute the mentioned eigenvalue problem . after solving it",
    ", we can calculate @xmath33 from ( [ eq : divbharm ] ) without any integration .",
    "we may easily conclude from ( [ eq : bharm ] ) that the results for @xmath22 for any @xmath4 can be inferred from those for @xmath34 with the help of the relation @xmath35 as long as we deal with direct solutions of the roberts dynamo problem ( up to section [ sec : sub model ] ) we therefore restrict our attention to the solutions with @xmath34 .",
    "in the discussion of the karlsruhe dynamo experiment ( section [ sec : applkar ] ) we admit also other values of @xmath4 .",
    "as mentioned above , roberts solved the relevant equations only for magnetic fields with the same periods in @xmath29 and @xmath30 as the flow pattern .",
    "we consider first this case only , in which we speak of  harmonic solutions \"",
    ". then @xmath25 must have the same periodicity in @xmath29 and @xmath30 as the flow pattern .    solving the eigenvalue problem defined by ( [ eq : bharm ] ) roberts found growth rates , that is real parts of @xmath22 , in its dependence on @xmath26 for values of @xmath18 up to 64 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p ] .",
    "@c@c@ + &    the imaginary parts of @xmath22 proved to be equal to zero ( numerically always close to zero ) , attesting that the dynamo instability is an absolute one .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field geometry is stationary while the intensity in general varies in time .",
    "soward @xcite has shown that in the limit of large @xmath18 the order of the maximum of the dimensionless growth rate , @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 .",
    "it occurs at a wave number @xmath38 for which @xmath39 .",
    "that is , @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "thus the roberts dynamo proves to be a slow one .",
    "this applies not only in the context of harmonic solutions , for it turns out that other solutions never grow faster than the fastest of the harmonic ones .    results for finite @xmath18 obtained in our calculations are given in fig . [ fig : p ] and in table [ tab : maxpkrm ] ; see also @xcite .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 given in table [ tab : maxpkrm ] approach constant values as @xmath18 grows and thus illustrate the mentioned asymptotic laws .",

    "in order to check a simple mean - field theory of the karlsruhe dynamo experiment we are interested in solutions @xmath8 of the induction equation ( [ inductiondim ] ) with period lengths exceeding those of the flow pattern , which we call  subharmonic solutions \" .",
    "we consider the case in which the period lengths of @xmath8 are larger by an integer factor @xmath49 than those of the flow pattern .",
    "as mentioned above , this problem has already been investigated by tilgner & busse @xcite for a few special values of @xmath49 and later by plunian and rdler @xcite .",
    "we focus our attention again on the induction equation ( [ inductiondim ] ) governing the magnetic field @xmath8 in all space .",
    "we use again ( [ eq : bb ] ) but consider @xmath50 no longer as a field with the same periodicity in @xmath29 and @xmath30 as the flow pattern .",
    "instead we put @xmath51 , where @xmath52 has now the same periodicity as the flow pattern and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are subharmonic wave numbers in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions . in that sense",
    "we look for solutions of the induction equation of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 being a complex periodic vector field with the same period length in @xmath29 and @xmath30 direction as the flow pattern , @xmath57 the real vector @xmath58 , and @xmath22 again a complex quantity ; for more details see @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention here to the case @xmath59 .",
    "then the period lengths of the magnetic field @xmath8 are just @xmath49 times that of the flow pattern",
    ". the harmonic solutions @xmath8 discussed above correspond to the limit @xmath60 .    inserting ( [ eq : bdef ] ) in ( [ inductiondim ] ) we find @xmath61 @xmath62 the system ( [ eq : b2 ] )",
    "defines an eigenvalue problem with @xmath22 being the eigenvalue parameter in his numerical calculations . ] .",
    "it has been solved numerically .",
    "marginal values of @xmath18 versus @xmath26 for @xmath63 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : marginal ] for different values of @xmath64 and again @xmath34 . for @xmath65",
    "there are both a critical @xmath18 and a critical @xmath26 below which dynamo action is not possible . in general @xmath22",
    "is no longer real , that is , we have no longer stationary but moving field structures .",
    "we point out that relation ( [ ki ] ) allows us the calculation of @xmath22 for arbitrary @xmath4 from that for @xmath48 .    @c@c@ + &",
    "the essential piece of the karlsruhe dynamo experiment is the  dynamo module \" , a cylindrical container with both radius and height somewhat less than 1 m , through which liquid sodium is driven by external pumps @xcite . by means of a system of channels with conducting walls , constituting 52  spin generators \" , a helical motion is organized .",
    "the flow pattern is similar to that defined by ( [ new1 ] ) .",
    "the 52 spin generators correspond to 26 periodic units of the flow pattern such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : roberts ] . the arrangement of the pumps allows to vary the parameters @xmath66 , or @xmath18 , and @xmath4 independently from each other .      in order to give an estimate for the self  excitation condition of",
    "the experimental device a simple mean ",
    "field theory has been developed @xcite .",
    "the mean magnetic field @xmath67 defined as above is assumed to satisfy the equations ( [ inducmean ] ) and ( [ eq : electromotive force ] ) inside the dynamo module and to continue in some way in outer space .",
    "of course , in this context @xmath67 can no longer be independent on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath68 can no longer have the simple forms ( [ kh09 ] ) , ( [ kh11 ] ) or ( [ kh17 ] ) . relying on some traditional concept",
    "it was assumed that the variations of @xmath67 in space are sufficiently weak so that @xmath68 in a given point can be represented by @xmath67 and its first spatial derivatives in this point .",
    "together with the symmetry properties of the roberts flow this leads to @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants depending on @xmath18 and @xmath4 , and @xmath72 is again the unit vector in @xmath23-direction @xcite . as in ( [ kh17 ] )",
    "the term with @xmath73 describes the anisotropic @xmath74effect acting in the @xmath75plane only .",
    "the terms with @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be interpreted by introducing an anisotropic mean - field diffusivity different from the molecular magnetic diffusivity .",
    "finally the term with @xmath71 describes a part of @xmath68 depending on derivatives of @xmath67 which can not be expressed by @xmath78 and therefore not be interpreted as a contribution to a modified diffusivity .",
    "several results have been derived on the dependence of @xmath73 on the fluid flow @xcite , and also such on @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath71 @xcite .    for a field @xmath67",
    "not depending on @xmath29 and @xmath30 and having no @xmath23component we have @xmath81 , and the last three terms on the right  hand side of ( [ meanemf ] ) can be written in the form @xmath82 . as to be expected , in this special case the structures of ( [ kh17 ] ) and ( [ meanemf ] ) coincide , and we have @xmath83 .",
    "our above remark on the @xmath71term in ( [ meanemf ] ) explains why the interpretation of the @xmath84term in ( [ kh17 ] ) as a contribution to a mean - field diffusivity is not compelling .",
    "the assumption on small variations of @xmath67 in space means in particular that @xmath67 does not change markedly across a spin generator . in that sense",
    "the usage of ( [ meanemf ] ) in a theory of the dynamo module can only be justified for a very large number of spin generators within the module .",
    "quite a few solutions of the equation ( [ inducmean ] ) for @xmath67 , applied to the dynamo module , with @xmath68 according to ( [ meanemf ] ) and various boundary conditions have been calculated @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "however , no other contribution to @xmath68 than the @xmath74effect , that is , only the first term on the right  hand side of ( [ meanemf ] ) was taken into account .",
    "contributions with higher than first derivatives of @xmath67 have never been considered . by these and other reasons",
    "a check of the results of the simple mean  field theory on a way that avoids the mentioned shortcomings seems very desirable .",
    "for this purpose we deal now with a very simple model of the dynamo module .",
    "we consider no longer a cylindrical module but instead a rectangular  dynamo box \" with a quadratic basis area in the @xmath75plane and denote the edge lengths of the box in this plane by @xmath85 and its hight by @xmath86 .",
    "thinking of the shape of the real dynamo module we put @xmath87 .",
    "we will study the excitation condition for a mean magnetic field @xmath67 which satisfies the equation ( [ inducmean ] ) and the relation ( [ eq : electromotive force ] ) in all space and is periodic in @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the period length @xmath88 and in @xmath23 with the period length @xmath89 .",
    "this periodicity means that the dynamo box contains just a  half wave \" of the field @xmath67 . for the sake of simplicity we use ( [ eq : electromotive force ] ) in its reduced form containing no other induction effect than the @xmath74effect",
    "we will then compare this excitation condition with that for a subharmonic @xmath8field whose longest wave lengths show the same periodicity , that is , which fits in the same sense to the dynamo box . in this context",
    "we put @xmath90 so that an area of @xmath91 in the @xmath75plane contains just 100 period units , that is , 200 cells of the flow pattern , consequently the basis area of the dynamo box 50 cells , which have to be compared with the 52 spin generators in the real dynamo module .",
    "@xmath90 means @xmath92 , and with @xmath87 we arrive at @xmath93 .    instead of a realistic boundary condition for the dynamo module we use here in fact the condition of periodic continuation of the magnetic fields both on the mean  field and the subharmonic level",
    ". such a condition might be in general problematic but seems acceptable for the comparison which we have in mind .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] we see that the value of @xmath94 for @xmath95 can , except for small @xmath18 , not be inferred from @xmath96 and @xmath97 only .",
    "this suggests that there will be discrepancies between the excitation conditions obtained with a mean  field theory which ignores contributions to @xmath68 with higher than first - order spatial derivatives and those derived from the subharmonic analysis .",
    "as already explained we assume for our mean  field consideration that equation ( [ inducmean ] ) and the reduced form of ( [ meanemf ] ) , that is , @xmath98 apply in all space with constant @xmath99 .",
    "we may represent @xmath67 as a sum of a poloidal and a toroidal part , @xmath100 with two defining scalars @xmath101 and @xmath102 . inserting this in ( [ inducmean2 ] ) and dropping unimportant constants we find @xmath103 the special periodic solution of ( [ inducmean2 ] ) which we are looking for",
    "is obtained with the ansatz @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are constants , @xmath64 and @xmath26 the parameters specified above and @xmath22 , which will prove to be real , is again the growth rate .",
    "when inserting this in ( [ system ] ) we arrive at two linear homogeneous equations for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the requirement that they allow non - trivial solutions leads to @xmath107 growing @xmath67 are possible in the case of the upper sign of the last term if @xmath108 is sufficiently large .",
    "the excitation condition reads @xmath109    in the representations of results on @xmath73 on which we now rely @xcite the latter is given in its original dimension so that it corresponds @xmath110 with our dimensionless @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore these results are given in terms of the two magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath111 and @xmath112 for the flow in the @xmath75-plane and in @xmath23-direction , respectively .",
    "these are connected with our @xmath18 and @xmath4 by @xmath113    the marginal states of the dynamo , in which @xmath67 neither grows nor decays , are given by pairs of @xmath112 and @xmath111 , or by the corresponding neutral curve in the @xmath114diagram .",
    "we may represent the result for arbitrary @xmath64 and @xmath26 by using the modified magnetic reynolds number @xmath115 defined by @xmath116 instead of @xmath111 .",
    "note that @xmath115 is no longer determined by @xmath14 alone but also by @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : f / k const ] shows a @xmath117diagram in which curve ( a ) gives just the result of our mean  field calculation .",
    "clearly dynamo action requires that @xmath115 exceeds a critical value .",
    "it appears , however , to be possible for any @xmath112 if only @xmath115 is sufficiently large .",
    "let us now compare this result with that for a corresponding subharmonic solution @xmath8 of the induction equation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f / k const ] the curve ( b ) is the neutral one for the subharmonic solution with the values of @xmath64 and @xmath26 specified above . clearly dynamo action requires now not only that @xmath115 exceeds a critical value but also that @xmath112 lies above such a value .",
    "in addition for each given @xmath112 allowing dynamo action the marginal value of @xmath115 derived in the subharmonic approach is higher than that concluded from the mean  field approach . in the range of @xmath112 between 1.2 and 2 , which corresponds to the actual situation in the karlsruhe experiment ,",
    "the deviation is larger than 20 % . of course it will become smaller in a comparison with a mean  field model which involves also the induction effects connected with first derivatives of @xmath67 indicated in ( [ meanemf ] ) ;",
    "see @xcite . but",
    "even then the mean  field approach underestimates the requirements for self  excitation .",
    "we have dealt with several aspects of the roberts dynamo problem and derived some results which are of interest for the karlsruhe dynamo experiment .",
    "although a rectangular dynamo box was considered , there are good reasons to assume that the main conclusions apply as well to the real experimental device with a cylindrical dynamo module . in the framework of",
    "the simple mean  field theory of the experiment self ",
    "excitation seems possible for arbitrary values of the magnetic reynolds number @xmath118 describing the flow perpendicular to the axes of the spin ",
    "generators if only the magnetic reynolds number @xmath119 for the axial flow is sufficiently large .",
    "an analysis based on subharmonic solutions revealed that a dynamo is only possible if both @xmath118 and @xmath119 exceed critical values .",
    "apart from this it was found that the simple mean - field theory underestimates the excitation condition of the dynamo .",
    "this discrepancy of the mean - field results with those obtained with subharmonic solutions can not be completely removed by taking into account the effect of the mean  field diffusivity .",
