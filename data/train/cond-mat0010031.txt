    "following the seminal studies of cahn @xcite and ebner and saam @xcite , two fundamental questions concerning the nature of the wetting transition have drawn an enormous amount of attention @xcite : firstly , is the transition first - order or continuous ?",
    "in particular , how does the order depend on the range and balance of the competing intermolecular forces ? secondly , for continuous ( critical ) wetting transitions , what role do the interfacial fluctuations of the unbinding fluid interface play in determining the critical exponents characterising the diverging lengthscales ?",
    "the answers to both these questions reveal a host of reasons why the laboratory observation of fluctuation effects at critical wetting is beset with difficulties . in brief , the well developed fluctuation theory of wetting concludes @xcite that three dimensional critical wetting requires a fine tuning of the effective hamaker constants appearing in the binding potential .",
    "this sensitivity means that critical wetting is a rather rare phenomena of which only very few examples are known for fluid - fluid interfaces @xcite .",
    "secondly , for systems with long - ranged forces , the critical exponents at critical wetting are mean - field - like ( and depend on the range of the forces ) and the interfacial roughness induced by fluctuations is very small . even for short - ranged forces , where renormalization group ( rg ) theory based on effective interfacial models famously predicts dramatic fluctuation induced effects @xcite , no appreciable deviations from simple mean - field like behaviour have been observed in either ising model simulation @xcite or recent experimental studies @xcite . at the very least ,",
    "this indicates that the asymptotic critical regime for critical wetting is much smaller than initially expected @xcite .",
    "the conclusion inevitably forced upon us appears to be that fluctuation effects at wetting transitions are of negligible practical importance .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to compare and contrast these features of critical wetting transitions with the properties of continuous ( critical ) filling transitions occuring in both wedge and cone shaped geometries .",
    "the thermodynamics of the filling transition has been discussed independently by a number of authors @xcite but only recently have the analogues of the above questions been addressed @xcite . here",
    "we present full details of a novel interfacial theory of wedge filling and also extend this approach to study fluctuation effects occuring at the filling transition of a fluid adsorbed in a cone shaped geometry .",
    "these turn out to be completely different to those predicted to occur in the wedge . in particular",
    "we wish to draw attention to two striking features of conic filling which have not been reported before .",
    "first , that the conditions for critical conic filling , even more than conditions for critical wedge filling , do not rely on any fine tuning of the binding potential structure and should be observable in cone geometries made from substrates that exhibit even strong first - order wetting .",
    "secondly we point out what appears to be an unexpected connection between the _ geometry - induced _ aspects of critical conic filling and the theory of the universal _ strong - fluctuation _",
    "( sfl ) regime of critical wetting @xcite .",
    "specifically , from analysis of effective interfacial hamiltonian models , we show that for the physically relevant dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and also for almost all choices of the intermolecular interactions , the influence of the conic geometry on the asymptotic critical behaviour and the detailed scaling structure of the interfacial height probability distribution function ( pdf ) as one approaches a critical cone filling transition is to mimic the way in which interfacial fluctuations determine the analogous exponents and the pdf for critical wetting transitions for planar wall - fluid ( or fluid - fluid ) interfaces belonging to the sfl scaling regime .",
    "this remarkable connection between conic filling and wetting and has already been noted in @xmath4 from the explicit results of exact transfer matrix and replica trick studies of two - dimensional filling transitions ( where , of course , the cone is analogous to a wedge ) in both pure and impure bulk systems @xcite .",
    "extending this theory our analysis shows that the fluctuation properties of three - dimensional conic filling are quite distinct from those occuring at three - dimensional wedge filling @xcite and are instead related to some of the most dramatic predictions of the theory of wetting for planar wall - fluid interfaces .",
    "thus in @xmath2 the divergence of the equilibrium filling layer thickness and roughness at cone filling are universal and the same as the renormalization group predictions of brezin , halperin and leibler @xcite for critical wetting with short - ranged forces in the large wetting parameter ( @xmath5 ) regime .",
    "our article is arranged as follows .",
    "in the next section we briefly recall the well known fluctuation theory predictions for critical wetting detailing the critical behaviour predicted to occur in the sfl regime in @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in ",
    "3 we present the main methods and results of the fluctuation theory of three dimensional wedge filling emphasising both the conditions for critical filling and the predictions for fluctuation dominated behaviour .",
    "a brief summary of these results has been given before @xcite .",
    "we finish this section by turning to the special case of filling in @xmath1 .",
    "the role of a breather - like soft mode which increases the width of the interface as it translates up and down the wedge is shown to be directly responsible for the scaling behaviour of the pdf . in ",
    "4 we discuss three dimensional cone filling , at mean - field level and beyond , predicting universal geometry - dominated critical behaviour characterised by an appreciable interfacial roughness and critical exponents identical to those predicted for the planar wetting sfl regime .",
    "we argue that this equivalence of the pdf s at cone filling and sfl wetting is special to @xmath1 and @xmath2 only .",
    "we finish our article with a summary of our main results .",
    "consider the preferential adsorption of a thick liquid film at the interface between a planar wall and a bulk vapour phase at chemical potential @xmath6 and a sub - critical temperature @xmath7 .",
    "we suppose that at bulk two phase coexistence , corresponding to chemical potential @xmath8 , the wall - vapour interface is completely wet by the liquid phase for temperatures @xmath9 .",
    "here we are interested in the values of the critical exponents describing the continuous divergence of the mean wetting film thickness @xmath10 , roughness @xmath11 and transverse correlation length @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the subscript @xmath14 is used to emphasise that these quantities are pertinent to planar wetting transitions .",
    "we denote the reduced temperature @xmath15 to avoid confusion with the filling reduced temperature ( q.v . ) .",
    "the standard theory of interfacial fluctuation effects at the wetting transition is based on analysis of the effective interfacial hamiltonian @xcite @xmath16 = \\int d { \\bf x } \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\nabla l   \\right)^2 + w(l ) \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a collective co - ordinate describing the local height of the interface above the wall , @xmath18 is the surface stiffness ( tension ) of the unbinding liquid - vapour interface and @xmath19 is the usual binding potential which accounts for the direct influence of the molecular forces .",
    "note that throughout this article we shall suppose that the factor @xmath20 is absorbed into all the effective hamiltonians , stiffnesses and potentials etc .",
    "mean - field ( mf ) studies indicate that for critical wetting ( with long - ranged forces ) @xmath19 is necessarily of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are effective hamaker constants . here the exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 are specific to the particular ranges of the intermolecular forces . in @xmath2 and for van der waals",
    "forces the appropriate values are @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for fixed dimension",
    "@xmath28 the scaling theory of lipowsky and fisher @xcite ( which is supported by transfer - matrix and approximate non - linear renormalization group ( rg ) studies ) predicts that the critical behaviour falls into three generic fluctuation classes labelled mean - field ( mf ) , weak - fluctuation ( wfl ) and strong - fluctuation ( sfl ) scaling regimes .",
    "these regimes arise due to the interplay of the direct binding potential with the entropic repulsion originating from the interfacial wandering .",
    "we briefly recall the scaling argument here since the same ideas generalise to filling transitions in wedge geometries .",
    "first recall that for interfaces , the roughness @xmath29 and the transverse correlation length @xmath30 are related via the wandering exponent @xmath31 .",
    "we write @xmath32 keeping the sub - script to avoid confusion with different wandering exponents that emerge for filling in wedges and cones . for thermal forces and",
    "@xmath28 it is well known that @xmath33 with @xmath29 finite for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the marginal case .",
    "thus we are led rather naturally @xcite to deduce that the bending energy term in and also the entropic effect of interface collisions with the wall gives rise to a fluctuation contribution to the effective potential of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the competition between these three terms gives rise to the three fluctuation regimes mentioned above . in the mf and wfl regimes",
    "the leading term in [ bpot ] is still dominant and the wetting transition temperature is unchanged by fluctuations .",
    "the critical exponents are non - universal and are given by @xcite @xmath39 @xmath40    in the sfl , corresponding to @xmath41 , and representing the critical behaviour in systems with short - ranged forces , the transition temperature is lowered by fluctuations and the critical exponents are universal . in @xmath1",
    "the critical exponents and the interfacial pdf , @xmath42 , are very well known ( see for example @xcite and also references in @xcite ) and given by @xmath43    notice that in both the sfl and wfl the interfacial fluctuations are very strong and @xmath44 for @xmath38 . the unusual bifurcation mechanism controlling the fixed point behaviour as @xmath45 means that critical wetting in three - dimensions systems is rather different in the sfl regime , though for systems with long - ranged forces mf theory remains valid .",
    "fluctuation effects are only predicted to occur for systems with short - ranged forces and are traditionally and most simply described by a bare binding potential of the form @xcite @xmath46 together with the hard - wall restriction @xmath47 for @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 denotes the inverse bulk correlation length of the adsorbed bulk phase whilst the hamaker constants @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same interpretation as for long - ranged forces discussed above .",
    "the mean - field predictions for short - ranged critical wetting are therefore @xmath52 ( ln ) and @xmath53 .",
    "the fluctuation theory of critical wetting with short - ranged forces was famously investigated by brezin , halperin and leiblier @xcite using a linearised rg scheme and shows that the critical behaviour is strongly non - universal and falls into three regimes ( labelled i - iii ) depending on the value of the dimensionless wetting parameter @xmath54 where @xmath55 the three regimes correspond to the ranges @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "usually attention focuses on the value of the transverse correlation length critical exponent which shows the strongest non - universal critical behaviour : @xmath59 where the last case corresponds to an essential singularity .",
    "in all three regimes the roughness @xmath60 so that interfacial wandering has a much more pronounced influence on the equilibrium distribution of matter in the wetting film compared to systems with long - ranged forces . in regimes ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) the wetting temperature is unchanged from its mean - field value and the film thickness still grows logarithmically but with a different amplitude to mean - field theory .",
    "the most dramatic effect of interfacial wandering is manifest in the regime ( iii ) which bears all the hallmarks of the sfl regime.here the wetting temperature is depressed by the fluctuations , and the critical exponents are given by @xmath61 with an equilibrium pdf which is a simple gaussian .",
    "consider a three - dimensional wedge formed by the junction of two walls at angles @xmath62 to the horizontal with the height of the wall above the plane is described by a height function @xmath63 .",
    "thus the wedge has a ` v ' shaped cross - section in the @xmath64-direction with the wedge bottom oriented along the @xmath65 axis .",
    "following our earlier discussion of wetting at planar walls we suppose that the wedge is in contact with a bulk vapour phase at saturation chemical potential @xmath66 .",
    "general thermodynamic considerations @xcite indicate that the wedge is completely filled by liquid for temperatures greater then the filling temperature @xmath67 , which is specified by the elegant equality @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the temperature dependent contact angle of the liquid drop at the planar wall - vapour interface .",
    "thus the influence of the wedge geometry is to lower the temperature at which the liquid - vapour interface unbinds from the wedge bottom compared to the planar wall . the filling transition occurring as @xmath70 may be first - order or critical corresponding to the discontinuous or continuous divergence of the equilibrium interfacial height @xmath71 measured from the bottom of the wedge .",
    "critical filling is also characterised @xcite by the divergence of distinct correlation lengths describing fluctuations in the interfacial height along ( @xmath72 ) and across ( @xmath73 ) the wedge and also by the roughness @xmath74 of the unbinding interface .",
    "note that the cross - wedge correlation length essentially measures the width of the flat , filled region of the wedge .",
    "the flatness of the filled region simply reflects the absence of any macroscopic curvature of the meniscus at two phase coexistence . recalling our earlier notation we define the wedge wetting critical exponents via @xmath75 where we have adopted a suitable super - script , @xmath76 ( for wedge ) , for some of the exponents to avoid confusion with those pertinent to critical wetting and also for cone filling which we will consider later .",
    "wedge filling can also be studied using a simple modification of the effective interfacial hamiltonian and for rather open wedges corresponding to small @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 ) the appropriate model is @xcite @xmath79 = \\int d x \\left\\{\\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\nabla l \\right)^2 + w(l - \\alpha \\vert x \\vert ) \\right\\ }   \\label{effhamw}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 denotes the height of the interface measured above the plane .",
    "as shown by rejmer @xcite this model can be justified from analysis of a more general drum - head model and with a binding potential interaction depending on the local normal distance of the interface to the wall rather than the simple vertical height used in .",
    "the simplifying approximations implicit in the above model do not effect any of the universal physics associated with the filling phase transition .      at mf",
    "level the equilibrium interfacial profile follows from the solution to the euler - lagrange equation found from the minimization of @xmath81 which is solved subject to the boundary conditions that @xmath82 and @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",
    "this equation can be integrated once and leads to simple condition for the mid - point height @xcite : @xmath85    note that in the limit @xmath86 , the rhs @xmath87 which follows from the youngs equation in the present small angle limit .",
    "the above equation has an elegant graphical interpretation @xcite from which one can determine the order of the filling phase transition occurring as @xmath88 at fixed @xmath77 or equivalently as @xmath89 at fixed temperature .",
    "thus the mf condition for first - order / critical wedge filling is that , at the filling temperature @xmath67 , the binding potential does / does not possess a local maximum separating the minimum at @xmath90 from the extremum at infinity .",
    "thus wedges made from walls that exhibit critical wetting , show critical filling whilst wedges made from walls that exhibit first - order wetting show both first order and critical filling depending on whether the filling temperature is above or below the spinodal temperature @xmath91 at which the first - order wetting binding potential develops a local maximum .",
    "note that since the filling temperature can be lowered almost arbitarily by increasing the wedge angle @xmath77 it follows that the wedge will typically show first - order filling if @xmath77 is small and critical filling for larger values of @xmath77",
    ". the tricritical value of at which the order of the filling transition changes character is given by @xmath92 the precise value of which depends on how weak the first - order wetting transition is .",
    "of course this argument presupposes that a spinodal temperature for the binding potential exists .",
    "this is certainly true for systems with short - ranged forces where it follows from the landau theory of wetting .",
    "for example in the global phase diagrams of nakanishi and fisher @xcite the locus of spinodal temperatures ( for different surface fields ) corresponds to the analytic extension of the critical wetting curve .",
    "the prediction that wedges made from walls exhibiting first - order wetting show critical filling can certainly be tested in ising model simulation studies . for experimental systems",
    "it may be that the mean - field condition for critical filling can not be met because the spinodal temperature @xmath91 is too low .",
    "however as we shall see , fluctuation effects lead to a second mechanism for critical filling beyond the mf condition described above which may overcome this difficulty .",
    "also , and perhaps of greater practical importance , we shall show that the mechanism for critical filling in a cone is rather different to that for a wedge and is much more easily fulfilled .",
    "to continue , from it immediately follows that at a critical filling transition the mf value of the order - parameter critical exponent is simply determined by the leading order decay of @xmath19 .",
    "the exponent @xmath25 plays no role and we find @xmath93 which is totally different to the corresponding mf critical exponent @xmath94 for critical wetting .",
    "the mf values of the other critical exponents follow from analysis of the height - height correlation function ( with @xmath95 ) @xmath96 and its fourier transform @xmath97 which exploits the translational invariance along the wedge . at mf level",
    ", @xmath98 follows from the solution to the ornstein - zernike equation @xmath99 where the direct - correlation function is defined by @xmath100}{\\delta l ( x ) \\delta l ( x ' ) } \\label{cxx'q}\\ ] ] evaluated at the equilibrium height .",
    "thus we arrive at the differential equation @xmath101 to proceed it is best to consider the moment expansion @xmath102 and first concentrate on the zeroth moment @xmath103 which describes the position dependence of correlations in the fluctuations of the interfacial height across the wedge .",
    "this is found by using standard techniques to be @xmath104    [ fig2 ]    where @xmath105 denotes the heaviside step function @xmath106 .",
    "thus the structure of correlations across the wedge reflects the properties of the equilibrium height profile @xmath107 found from the solution to the euler - lagrange equation ( [",
    "e - l ] ) , which is particularly simple .",
    "in essence , the interface is flat such that @xmath108 , for @xmath109 , while for @xmath110 the height decays exponentially quickly to its planar value @xmath111 .",
    "importantly , the lengthscale which controls the exponential decay is the wetting correlation length @xmath30 , which remains microscopic at the filling transition temperature .",
    "one consequence of this is that we can anticipate that the lateral width of the filled region of the wedge is trivally identified as @xmath112 so that @xmath113 . in this way",
    "we conclude that @xmath114 is essentially position independent provided @xmath115 implying that the whole filled portion of the wedge fluctuates coherently .",
    "moreover that there is negligible correlation between height fluctuations inside the wedge with those outside and simlarly between positions on either side of the filled region . from one",
    "can iteratively construct the position dependence of the higher moments using the integral equation @xmath116 which follows from the ornstein - zernike equation above . from this",
    "it follows that in the asymptotic critical ( scaling ) regime @xmath117 is position independent for @xmath118 with @xmath119 and is negligible otherwise .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the simple lorentzian structure factor @xmath120 where @xmath121 and identifies the mf correlation length along the wedge @xmath72 as @xmath122 substituting for @xmath123 we find the desired mf critical exponent @xmath124 as @xmath125 .",
    "the important observation here is that @xmath126 so that the fluctuations are highly anisotropic and dominated by the modes along the wedge .",
    "indeed as one approaches the bulk phase boundary @xmath72 becomes arbitrarily larger than @xmath73 implying that the fluctuations become pseudo - one dimensional .",
    "the last lengthscale to calculate within the mf analysis is the midpoint roughness defined by @xmath127 ^ 2 \\rangle$ ] which can be identified from the relation @xmath128 where the rhs can be obtained from the fourier inversion of @xmath129 .",
    "this leads to the roughness relation for the @xmath2 wedge @xmath130 which is one of the central results of the mf analysis . substituting for the divergence of @xmath72 and @xmath123 we find that all dependence on the binding potential exponent @xmath24 cancels leading to a remarkable universal divergence @xmath131 valid for all ranges of intermolecular potential .",
    "in summary , the mf values of the lenghscale critical exponents at critical filling are @xmath132 next we turn to the fluctuation theory of filling beyond mf approximation .",
    "the mf analysis presented above is only valid if the fluctuations are small in some sense .",
    "since the divergence of @xmath29 , even within mf , is algebraic we can simply use the ` contact condition ' @xcite that @xmath29 can not be greater than @xmath133 to determine the ginzburg criterion for the breakdown of mf theory . thus we can assert that the above critical exponents are valid provided @xmath134 which in the limit @xmath135 implies that @xmath24 must be less then @xmath136 . for @xmath137 , fluctuation effects dominate and we can anticipate ( analogous to the wfl and sfl regime behaviour of critical wetting ) that the roughness @xmath29 is comparable with the interfacial height @xmath133 . unfortunately it is very difficult to develop a full fluctuation theory of filling transitions based on the effective interfacial hamiltonian since , as is clear from the above remarks , the upper critical dimensions for wetting and filling are quite different .",
    "the situation is rather similar to that encountered in the theory of wetting where one would ideally like to develop a fluctuation theory based on analysis of , say , a semi - infinite ising or landau - ginzburg wilson ( lgw ) model .",
    "such a approach would afford a description of both bulk ( and surface ) critical behaviour and also of wetting .",
    "since this has not proved possible one instead focuses on effective models constructed to capture the essential physics of the phase transition in question .",
    "of course , all hamiltonians are effective hamiltonians but some are more effective than others . the lgw model based on a local magnetization order - parameter can ( in principle ) describe bulk and surface criticality in addition to wetting and filling . in turn the effective interfacial hamiltonian based on a collective co - ordinate @xmath80 is a theory of wetting and filling .",
    "the task here is to develop a simpler model than which just affords a description of filling .",
    "the theory of wedge filling which we propose is constructed from the full interfacial model under the assumption that the only fluctuations that determine the asymptotic critical behaviour arise from the pseudo - one dimensional long - wavelength undulations in the local height of the filled region .",
    "we refer to fluctuations in the local height as breather modes since these increase / decrease the local width of the filled region ( and the volume of liquid beneath it ) .",
    "thus we seek to derive a model based on a collective co - ordinate @xmath138 which only describes these modes ( see fig 3.1 ) and which is valid for sufficiently small wave - vectors @xmath139 .",
    "such a model can be easily constructed by generalising the method introduced by fisher and jin @xcite for the derivation of wetting interfacial models from the lgw hamiltonian . assuming that for a given constrained configuration of the mid - point height @xmath138 that all other fluctuations are small ( relative to the soft mode ) , it follows that the desired filling hamiltonian can be identified by @xmath140 ) = \\mathcal{t } \\ ! \\mbox{{\\it",

    "since this trace is over non - critical fluctuations one can employ a saddle - point idenifiction @xmath143 = h[l^{\\dag}(x , y;l_0 ( \\cdot ) ) ] \\label{hdef2}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 denotes the profile that minimises subject to the gcc .",
    "as in the fisher - jin theory of wetting , the desired non - planar constrained configurations can be constructed perturbatively in terms of constrained profiles that are translationally invariant along the wedge ( analogous to the planar constrained magnetization profiles ) which we simply write as @xmath145 to avoid a proliferation of indices .",
    "these translationally invariant profiles satisfy the euler - lagrange subject to the gcc @xmath146 .",
    "the resulting wedge filling model has the form @xmath147 = \\int dy \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma(l_0)}{2 } \\left(\\frac{d l_0}{d y } \\right)^2 + v_w ( l_0 ) \\right\\ } \\label{feffhamdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 denotes the wedge binding potential and @xmath149 is a position dependent wedge line stiffness . formally these quantities are determined by the relations @xmath150 ( up to unimportant additive constants defined such that @xmath151 ) and @xmath152 the planar constrained profiles @xmath153 have the same simple near - flat structure as the equilibrium mf profile discussed earlier .",
    "this means that the evaluation of ( [ vf ] , [ sigmal ] ) is particularly simple so that for first - order and critical wedge filling we can approximate @xmath147 = \\int dy \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma l_0}{\\alpha } \\left(\\frac{d l_0}{d y } \\right)^2 + v_w ( l_0 ) \\right\\ } \\label{feffham}\\ ] ] the qualitative and quantitative form of the filling potential depends on the order of the mf phase transition . for critical",
    "filling it has the expansion @xmath154 and of course fluctuations are restricted to the region @xmath155 analogous to the hard - wall condition for wetting . here",
    "the effective hamaker constant @xmath156 and note that the coefficient of the linear term is simply proportional to @xmath157 , the relevant reduced temperature .",
    "the critical filling potential shows a single minimum ( located precisely at the mf value of @xmath123 ) which continuously moves out to infinity as @xmath135 .",
    "the one - dimensional filling hamiltonian can be studied using a number of different techniques including transfer - matrix theory @xcite and approximate rg methods @xcite .",
    "however there is no need to go to these lengths to extract the fluctuation regimes and the values of the critical exponents since they follow from a simple extension of the lipowsky - fisher scaling theory considered earlier . to see this",
    "we suppose that the influence of fluctuations at critical filling follows from analysis of an effective potential @xmath158 which accounts for the entropic repulsion of the unbinding interface from the wedge bottom . again",
    "the fluctuation term can be estimated from both the form of the bending energy contribution to and also the number of collisions the interface has with the wedge bottom .",
    "this we estimate to of order @xmath159 where @xmath160 denotes the thermal wandering exponent for wedge filling ( in @xmath2 ) relating the roughness and pertinent correlation length @xmath161 .",
    "the value @xmath162 follows from considering the invariance of the free part of the filling hamiltonian under the scale transformation @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "thus we arrive at an effective filling potential of the form @xmath165 which has a single minimum at the equilibrium mid - point height . in this way we find two different fluctuation regimes for filling depending on whether the direct intermolecular potential or entropic contribution determines the next - to - leading order correction to the linear term in .",
    "the leading linear term is always relevant ( in the rg sense ) and reflects the influence of the wedge geometry on the statistical / thermodynamic properties of filling .",
    "this is rather similar to the theory of fluctuation effects at complete wetting transitions @xcite . in this way",
    "we predict there exists a filling mf regime ( fmf ) for @xmath166 , with exponents given by and a filling fluctuation dominated regime ( ffl ) for @xmath137 with @xmath167 as a final remark we turn to the effective one - dimensional hamiltonian description of first - order filling .",
    "this is based on the model but with a different potential @xmath148 the form of which is shown in fig",
    "in fact the structure of @xmath148 for this case can be qualitatively deduced by noticing that the extrema of @xmath148 must correspond to the possible solutions of the mf equation . for @xmath168",
    ", @xmath148 has only a single minimum which remains finite at @xmath169 .",
    "however for @xmath170 a potential barrier appears separating the local minimum and the infinitely deep potential well at infinity . note that exactly at the first - order filling transition temperature the minimum of @xmath148 has a finite well - depth relative to @xmath171",
    "this is quite unlike the behaviour of @xmath19 at first - order wetting transitions .",
    "these remarks indicate even if the mean - field condition for critical filling is not fulfilled , the influence of the one - dimensional breather mode fluctuations may still drive the transition critical by causing the interface to tunnel away from the local minimum of the potential . whether this happens or not depends on the range and depth of the minimum of @xmath148 but will certainly be most important for systems with short - ranged forces ( such as ising models ) .",
    "note this tunnelling mechanism does not alter the filling transition phase boundary which simply reflects the relevance of the linear term in @xmath148 .",
    "one may also note that this tunnelling must definitely occur out of coexistence for temperatures @xmath172 where it is responsible for the washing out of the pre - filling line .",
    "[ fig3 ]    we mention only briefly here that it is trivial to investigate critical wedge filling from off - bulk co - existence using the effective model by allowing for a term of order @xmath173 which couples to the undersaturation in the filling potential .",
    "this clearly represents the contribution from the volume of undersaturated liquid in the filled region of the wedge . from this one",
    "can readily establish that the filling thickness , roughness and correlation lengths all exhibit scaling with a gap exponent @xmath174 in the ffl regime.thus the divergence of the mean interface height along the critical wedge isotherm as one approaches saturation is characterised by a @xmath175 power law .",
    "it is a simple matter to extend the wedge filling fluctuation theory to arbitrary dimensions @xmath176 and in particular @xmath1 where one can compare the predictions with the exact transfer matrix solution of the full interfacial model .",
    "consider a wedge in bulk @xmath176 dimensions which is of ` v ' shape cross - section in the @xmath64 direction but which is translationally invariant in the remaining @xmath177 ( surface ) dimensions . denoting the position of the interface above the wedge bottom by @xmath178 where @xmath179 denotes the @xmath180 dimensional vector parallel to the wedge orientation .",

    "the scaling theory also generalises in a natural way .",
    "first we calculate the @xmath176 dimensional wedge wandering exponent @xmath181 by considering the invariance of the free part of under scale transformations .",
    "this determines @xmath181 as @xmath182 relating the roughness and correlation length measured along the wedge ( which we here denote @xmath183 ) via @xmath184 .",
    "similarly the fluctuation contribution to the effective potential arising from the bending energy and entropy terms scales as @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the wedge fluctuation exponent analogous to @xmath187 in the lipowsky - fisher theory of wetting .",
    "this heuristic scaling theory predicts that for general dimension @xmath188 , the criticality at filling falls into a mean - field ( fmf ) and fluctuation dominated ( ffl ) regime depending on whether @xmath24 is less or greater than the marginal value @xmath189 .",
    "the critical exponents are given by @xmath190 @xmath191 and notice that it is only in @xmath2 that the roughness exponent is universal independent of the range of the forces .",
    "these predictions for critical singularities at wedge filling are , in general very different to the predictions for critical wetting .",
    "however for the special case of @xmath1 there appears to be a connection between filling and critical wetting discussed below . in @xmath1",
    "the breather fluctuation theory predicts that the marginal intermolecular range is @xmath192 and that the values of the ffl regime critical exponents are @xmath193 with @xmath124 undefined .",
    "note that these are pertinent to all physical examples of intermolecular forces .",
    "the first thing to observe here is that the numerical values of the filling critical exponents @xmath194 and @xmath195 in the @xmath1 ffl are identical to the analogous critical wetting exponents in the ( @xmath1 ) sfl regime . as we shall now see this coincidence extends to the full form of the pdf .",
    "as well as predicting the critical exponents at filling the fluctuation theory also predicts the position dependence of the scaling form of the mid - point pdf , @xmath196 . to see this note that the case of wedge filling in @xmath1 is special because the breather mode is only subject to zero dimensional fluctuations since there is no direction along the wedge . as a result",
    "one can go beyond the above predictions for the values of the critical exponents and assert that in the asymptotic critical region , the mid - point pdf is given by @xmath197 where here ( and below ) @xmath198 denotes a suitable normalization factor . now from we have @xmath199 so that in the critical regime the breather fluctuation theory leads to the scaling form of the pdf @xmath200 or equivalently @xmath201 which is of course consistent with the values of the critical exponents quoted in .",
    "this prediction is remarkable for two reasons : ( i ) it is in exact agreement with the transfer matrix result for the pdf based on the ( @xmath1 ) interfacial model .",
    "for quite arbitrary choices of binding potential the mid - point interface height distribution function is given by @xcite @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the ground state eigenfunction appearing in the transfer matrix spectrum for @xmath1 wetting at a planar wall .",
    "this satisfies the well known schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the corresponding groundstate eigenvalue which is related to the contact angle by @xmath206 . from the properties of",
    "@xmath203 it follows that the filling transition is indeed characterised by the scaling regimes and corresponding critical singularities predicted by the general fluctuation theory .",
    "moreover for @xmath207 , and far from the wall the wave function decays as @xmath208 so that and are identical .",
    "the equivalence of the scaling form of the pdf with the breather mode fluctuation theory and the full effective interfacial model completely supports our conjecture that it is the overall breather mode which translates the interface up and down the sides of the wedge , rather than the thermal wandering of the interface within the filled region that determines the criticality at filling .",
    "\\(ii ) the derived expression for the filling pdf in the ffl regime has an identical structure to the analogous interfacial height pdf , @xmath209 for critical wetting in the sfl . recall that this quantity is determined as @xmath210 with the transfer matrix approach so that we in the sfl we have the well known result , quoted earlier @xmath211 which is identical to the result for filling .",
    "in fact in @xmath1 the connection between filling and critical wetting for purely thermal disorder extends to the case marginal case @xmath212 for filling where the structure of the fmf / ffl pdf has the same form as the pdf for critical wetting at a wfl / mf borderline for which the specific heat exponent vanishes @xcite .",
    "the pdf for this case is not simply a pure exponential function .",
    "the equivalence of the film thickness ( and roughness ) critical exponents and pdf s for two dimensional , fluctuation - dominated filling and wetting has also been established for the case of filling / wetting with random bond disorder described by the interfacial model @xcite @xmath79 = \\int \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2}(\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial x})^2+v_r(x , l(x))+ w(l-\\alpha \\vert x \\vert ) \\right\\ } \\label{randh}\\ ] ] with disorder averages satisfying @xmath213 and @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a measure of the disorder .",
    "the study of filling transitions in this model allows us to test the possible connection between fluctuation dominated two dimensional filling and critical wetting in a system where the interfacial wandering exponent is different to the thermal case .",
    "it transpires that for systems with purely short - ranged forces the model can be solved exactly using the transfer matrix method by extending kardar s bethe ansatz approach @xcite used in his analysis of wetting .",
    "this again confirms the thermodynamic prediction for the location of the filling transition and identifies the universal filling critical exponents as @xmath216 which are identical to the analogous critical exponents @xmath217 and @xmath218 , determined by kardar for critical wetting with random bonds with short - ranged forces corresponding to the sfl regime @xcite . the expression for the scaling form of the mid - point interfacial height pdf @xmath219 for @xmath1 random bond filling is highly non - trivial but again analysis shows that it is identical to the pdf for random bond wetting @xcite .",
    "consider a non - planar wall - fluid interface in the shape of an infinite cone which makes an angle @xmath77 to the horizontal .",
    "thus , for open wedges ( small @xmath77 ) the height of the wall above the plane is described by a height function @xmath220 with @xmath221 the displacement vector along the two - dimensional displacement vector along the horizontal plane with origin at the cone apex . as before the wall",
    "is supposed to be in contact with a vapour phase at two - phase coexistence with thermodynamics indicating that the cone is completely filled for @xmath172 , where the conic filling temperature @xmath67 satisfies the same condition @xmath222 as filling in the @xmath2 wedge .",
    "we allow for the possibility of first - order and critical cone filling corresponding to the discontinuous or continuous divergence of the mid - point filling height @xmath223 as @xmath224 . also of interest",
    "is the roughness @xmath29 arising from the interfacial fluctuations of the unbinding liquid vapour interface .",
    "the radius of the near flat , filled region of the cone , which also characterises height fluctuations in the central region is trivially related to the height via @xmath225 . as with wedge filling",
    "we anticipate that for radial positions @xmath226 the interface will simply take the microscopic value @xmath111 it would have on a planar wall .",
    "thus we define two lengthscale critical exponents for critical cone filling by @xmath227 in an obvious notation . here",
    "we seek to understand both the conditions under which critical cone filling can occur and the values of the critical exponents at mf level and beyond .",
    "as we shall show these are quite distinct from the situation for wedge filling .    following our earlier treatment of wedge filling we anticipate that interfacial fluctuations manifest themselves in two different ways at conic filling .",
    "firstly there is the usual wandering of the interface within the filled region determined by the value of the standard wandering exponent @xmath32 which is of course marginal in @xmath2 ( concentrating on thermal fluctuations ) .",
    "such fluctuations would occur even if the edges of the filled region were fixed to a given height , @xmath123 say , and would contribute terms of order @xmath228 and @xmath229 to the interfacial roughness in @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "however much more important than this is the breather mode that translates the entire flat region up and down the cone .",
    "the fundamental distinction between three - dimensional wedge and cone filling arises because the breather mode is thermally excited by quasi - one dimensional and zero - dimensional excitations respectively . in this respect three",
    "dimensional conic filling is the higher dimensional version of two - dimensional filling considered in the last section .",
    "note that the effective dimensionality of the breather mode does not destroy the phase transition because the fluctuating field diverges as the filling temperature is approached .      denoting the local interfacial height above the plane by @xmath230 , the natural starting point for the study of conic filling for open cones ( small @xmath77 ) is the standard interfacial model @xmath79 = \\int d \\vec{r } \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\nabla l \\right)^2 + w(l - \\alpha { r } ) \\right\\ } \\label{coneeffham}\\ ] ] where , again , @xmath221 denotes the radial vector from the apex . to begin we chose binding potentials @xmath19 of the type corresponding to walls that exhibit critical wetting and set the exponent parameter @xmath231 .",
    "numerical minimization of the model hamiltonian for different ranges of the intermolecular potential shows that the filling transition is critical ( for the present choice of critical wetting walls ) and located precisely at @xmath232 .",
    "however the numerics also indicates that the mf value of the critical exponent characterising the divergence of @xmath133 appears to fall into two distinct regimes . for @xmath207",
    "the critical behaviour is universal and dominated by the geometry such that @xmath233 . on the other hand if @xmath234 the critical exponent is consistent with the identification @xmath235 , identical to that found within the mf theory of wedge filling",
    "this intriguing mf critical behaviour follows from a very simple and highly accurate variational theory of conic filling .",
    "noting the simplicity of the equilibrium interfacial profiles obtained in our numerical minimization we parameterise the possible height function by @xmath236 and determine the mid - point height dependence of the conic filling potential defined by @xmath237 - h[l^{\\dag } ] \\big|_{l^{\\dag } ( 0 ) = l_{\\pi } } \\label{coneveff}\\ ] ]    note that this variational approximation becomes increasingly accurate for as one approaces a critical filling transition since the profile tends to a macroscopically flat meniscus .",
    "minimization of the conic filling potential leads to the following integral equation for the mid - point height @xmath238    this equation has an simple graphical interpretation which recovers the numerical results quoted above and leads to an elegant criterion for the order of the filling transition .",
    "the filling transition is continuous provided @xmath239 corresponding to an integral measure of the overall attractive / repulsive nature of the binding potential . by allowing for pertubations to the simple variational ansatz it is easy to show that this is the exact mf condition for criticality within the effective interfacial model to order @xmath240 .",
    "the condition for criticality of conic filling is much less severe than that for both critical wetting and critical wedge filling and implies that even substrates which exhibit rather strong first order - wetting will exhibit a continuous filling transition in a cone geometry .",
    "a comparison of the respective shapes of the binding potential need for criticality for three dimensional wetting , wedge filling and cone filling is shown in fig . 4.1 . provided the condition for critical cone filling is met the mf critical exponent falls into two regimes : @xmath241    [ fig4 ]    the universality of the critical behaviour in the geometry dominated critical regime is reminiscient of the way in which fluctuation effects lead to universal critical behaviour at wetting transitions . this connection is explored further below .",
    "the effective zero - dimensionality of the breather mode at conic filling suggests that we should analyse fluctuation effects in the same manner as we did for filling of a wedge / cone in @xmath1 . recall that this simple approach gave the precise scaling form of the mid - point interfacial height pdf ( and hence the critical exponents ) at filling as that found from the exact transfer - matrix theory .",
    "accordingly we propose that the critical behaviour at conic filling is described by a pdf for the mid - point interfacial height is of the form @xmath242 since the role of the cone potential in @xmath2 is analogous to the wedge potential @xmath148 in @xmath1 .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that @xmath243 has the form @xmath244 consistent with the mf values of the critical exponents discussed above .",
    "the three terms in this expression represent the purely geometrical contributions arising form the area and circumference of the filled region and also the direct influence of the specific intermolecular forces .",
    "both @xmath245 and @xmath246 are positive effective hamaker constants . for @xmath207",
    "the final term in is irrelevant , geometry dominates and the pdf can be written @xmath247 and identifies the universal values of the critical exponents as @xmath248 on the other hand if the second term in is irrelevant and close to its most probable position the pdf is gaussian with critical exponents given by @xmath249 equations and ( [ conepdf]-[conecos2 ] ) are the main predictions of this section . here",
    "we make two pertinent remarks :    \\(i ) the mf values of the filling height critical exponent @xmath250 is unchanged by fluctuations .",
    "however the thermal fluctuations of the breather mode do lead to an appreciable interfacial roughness .",
    "the predictions are appropriate for both experimental systems with long - ranged dispersion forces and simulation studies of ising - like systems with short - ranged forces . for discrete lattice based ising studies , it is probably more convenient to study adsorption in an inverted pyramid shaped geometry .",
    "the critical exponents are the same as the cone for this case .",
    "\\(ii ) the scaling form of the pdf and the values of the critical exponents in the universal geometry dominated regime of cone filling are identical to the analogous critical singularities characteristic of the sfl regime of critical wetting short - ranged forces i.e. regime ( iii ) corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "this is directly analogous to the observations made earlier for wedge / cone filling in @xmath1 .",
    "the above predictions point to a remarkable coincidence between the universality of conic filling in @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the sfl regime of critical wetting in the same dimension which is encapsulated in the equivalence of the film thickness and roughness critical exponents as well as the interfacial height pdf s . thus in the important geometry dominated regimes of cone filling and for the physically relevant dimensions @xmath4 and @xmath251 one can identify @xmath252      the above predictions beg the question , why does the influence of the cone geometry on the ( universal ) unbinding at filling mimic the fluctuations characteristic of critical wetting in the sfl ?",
    "usually , of course , if two different systems exhibit the same critical exponents one concludes , after identifying the appropriate order - parameter , that they belong to the same universality class .",
    "we do not believe that this is the correct explanation because in this case there does not appear to be an analogue of the wetting correlation length critical exponent @xmath253 for filling .",
    "in other words the equivalence of the one - point pdf s does not extend to the two point function .",
    "in view of this we forward a simple plausibility argument suggesting that the equivalence of the pdf s is not simply coincidence but _ is _ special to the physical dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasise that the specific results of our model calculations for the values of the critical exponents stand quite apart from this discussion .",
    "let us focus on the structure of the pdf for critical wetting at a planar wall in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath42 is found by evaluating the ( normalised ) boltzmann sum over all interfacial configurations that pass through the specified height @xmath17 at an arbitarily chosen position @xmath254 ( say ) , equivalent to the identification @xmath255}$ ] where @xmath256 and @xmath257 is the partial partition function summing over this class of configurations . in turn the constrained free - energy @xmath258",
    "$ ] is a functional of the constrained height profile corresponding to the ( partial ) average over all profiles that satisfy the appropriate condition @xmath259 .",
    "for large @xmath260 the constrained profile determining the pdf naturally forms the shape of a triangle ( in @xmath1 ) and cone ( in @xmath2 ) characterised by the equilibrium contact angle @xmath261 .",
    "thus the droplet shape of the constrained profile determining the asymptotics of @xmath262 near critical wetting is essentially identical to the equilibrium height profile measured with respect to the local wall height near critical cone filling ( since @xmath263 ) .",
    "this observation hints at a possible connection between the pdf s at wetting and cone filling .",
    "one may also reason that if there is any connection between the pdf s of filling and wetting then it will only be valid when the direct effect of intermolecular interactions is unimportant since the non - universal influence of these forces manifests itself in very different ways .",
    "this is only true in the geometry dominated regime of cone filling and the sfl regime of critical wetting .    on the other hand",
    "it is easy to see that any connection between the two pdf s is not valid for all dimensions .",
    "the generalisation of our simple fluctuation theory of cone filling presented to arbitary dimension @xmath176 is immediate .",
    "using the same variational approach described above we arrive at a cone binding potential of the form ( neglecting unimportant constants ) @xmath264 representing the leading order surface and line contributions .",
    "the influence of intermolecular forces is present through a term @xmath265 which is higher - order for @xmath266 independent of the dimensionality . using this cone potential to evaluate",
    "the pdf arising from the ( zero - deimensional ) thermal fluctuations of the breather mode leads to the following prediction for the universal , geometry dominated cone filling critical singularities in arbitrary dimension @xmath267 , @xmath268 which of course recovers our results for wedge / cone filling in @xmath1 and cone filling in @xmath2 as special cases . for @xmath269",
    "the roughness remains finite . only for the physically important dimensions @xmath270 to the numerical values of these critical exponents coincide with the predictions for sfl regime critical wetting .",
    "nevertheless we find it remarkable that for these special dimensions not only the values of the critical exponents but also the detailed form of the pdf s are identical for filling and critical wetting .",
    "finally we mention that the exponents quoted above allow us to identify the value of the wandering exponent for critical cone filling defined by @xmath271 . noting that interfacial height is trivially related to the radial correlation length ( width ) of the filled region we are led to the identification    @xmath272    which shows the influence of the zero - dimensional breather mode on the distribution of matter .",
    "obviuously in two dimensions @xmath273 since the cone and wedge geometries are identical .",
    "in this article we have presented details of a general fluctuation theory of filling transitions at wedges and cones . the main results and conclusions of our study",
    "are summarised below :    \\(i ) the dominant interfacial fluctuations at wedge and cone filling correspond to breather - like motion that translates the flat , filled region up and down the sides of the confining geometry .",
    "\\(ii ) for three dimensional wedge filling the thermal excitations of the breather mode are described by a novel one - dimensional effective hamiltonian which predicts a universal value of @xmath274 for the roughness critical exponent for all ranges of the intermolecular forces and also large scale interfacial roughness and universal critical singularities for @xmath275 .",
    "\\(iii ) for filling in @xmath1 , the simple picture of an effective zero - dimensional fluctuating breather mode correctly captures the critical exponents and precise scaling behaviour of the mid - point height pdf as found from the full transfer - matrix solution to the full interfacial model ( of wetting and filling ) .",
    "\\(iv ) for two - dimensional filling with both thermal and random bond disorder the scaling of the mid - point height pdf is identical to the corresponding results for sfl regime critical wetting in this dimensionality .",
    "\\(v ) conic filling shows two different types of critical behaviour including a universal geometry dominated regime for @xmath207 pertinent to all physical types of intermolecular force . applying the simple breather - like fluctuation picture to this phase transition",
    "yields a scaling form for the pdf and associated interfacial height and roughness critical exponents identical to the sfl regime prediction for critical wetting in this dimensionality .",
    "we have argued that this equivalence of the pdf s is special to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "\\(vi ) even at mf level the conditions under which three dimensional wedge and cone filling are continuous are different to the fine tuning required for critical wetting and are sensitive to the particular geometry . for critical wedge",
    "wetting one requires that the binding potential shape at @xmath169 shows no local maximum . on the other hand cone - filling",
    "is critical provided the integrated weight of the potential remains negative ( attractive ) .",
    "these conclusions , regarding both the conditions for criticality and the manifestations of interfacial fluctuations at wedge and cone filling , are in sharp contrast to the situation for critical wetting .",
    "concentrating on the values of the thickness and roughness critical exponents as pertinent to realistic three - dimensional systems with non - retarded van der waals forces ( @xmath276 ) we have @xmath277 @xmath278 @xmath279 indicating that the geometry has a profound influence on the roughness of the interface .",
    "this reflects the special role of the breather mode at filling transitions .",
    "consequently if critical wetting at a wall - fluid interface were ever seen experimentally , the observation of wedge and cone filling in this system would certainly provide a means of observing large scale interfacial fluctuations .",
    "it should certainly be possible to test the predictions of universal and large scale interfacial fluctuation related behaviour in ising model systems .",
    "we have also emphasised that the geometry dramatically alters the conditions for criticality and certainly relaxes the requirement of fine tuning the values of the hamaker constants necessary for critical wetting .",
    "the condition for inducing continuous filling transitions is easiest to fulfil for the cone geometry and is highly encouraging that the observation of critical filling in cones made from walls exhibiting first - order wetting is experimentally feasible . it may even be possible to further manipulate the conditions for criticality by considering filling in other geometries and by introducing chemical heterogeniety",
    "throughout this article we have focused exclusively on the filling transition occuring as @xmath88 at bulk two - phase coexistence . also of interest",
    "is the influence of the geometry on complete wetting adsorption isotherms corresponding to the continuous divergence of the filling thickness for temperatures @xmath172 as @xmath280 @xcite .",
    "these transitions have also received much recent attention and show great sensitivity to the shape of the confining geometry . for cones and wedges in all dimensions",
    "the divergence of the filling height is super - universal and given by @xmath281 where @xmath282 denotes the undersaturation .",
    "however unlike critical filling the breather mode does not change the nature of the roughness so that @xmath283 .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore the possible connection between conic filling and sfl critical wetting in two and three dimensions in more detail .",
    "whilst for @xmath1 the equivalence of the critical exponents and pdf s has been establised exactly using transfer - matrix methods it would be extremely instructive to understand this from a rg perspective .",
    "this would perhaps throw light on a more detailed theory of three dimensional cone filling based on the full interfacial model .",
    "also our analysis of wedge and conic filling in @xmath2 was limited to pure thermal disorder unlike our analysis in @xmath1 .",
    "studies of three dimensional wedge and cone filling in impure systems would be very illuminating",
    ". it may be that for impure systems , filling and sfl critical wetting only share common features in @xmath1 .",
