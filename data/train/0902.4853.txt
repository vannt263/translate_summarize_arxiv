    "aa  doradus ( lb  3459 , hd  269696 , @xmath9 ) is a well known , close , short period ( 0.261 d ) , totally eclipsing binary consisting of a hot ( @xmath10 ) sdob , compact star and an invisible object .",
    "a recent review of @xcite gives a broad description of the sdb and sdo sub - dwarfs and of the intense research in this field .",
    "the eclipses of the sdob primary component of aa  dor are total and deep ( @xmath11 mag ) .",
    "the illumination ( reflection ) effect from the invisible body is very strong and highly wavelength dependent : it is apparently mostly the heating effect as it is the strongest in ir and almost absent in uv ; the secondary eclipses are entirely due to the eclipses of this additional , `` reflected '' light .",
    "previous investigations of aa  dor @xcite have resulted in an excellent and detailed description of its geometry in _ relative _ units : the relative radii ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and the orbital inclination ( @xmath14 ) are known to a very high accuracy . however , the _ absolute _ parameters of aa  dor have not been known until the very recent paper of @xcite .",
    "this is related to the single - lined ( sb1 ) character of the spectrum which can provide only the semi - amplitude @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , the absolute sizes and masses could only be guessed using various reasonable assumptions on the mass of the visible star and/or the mass ratio . however , the sdob component is not an average and typical star so such assumptions may be risky .",
    "@xcite , through ingenious data processing of the same data as used in this paper , have been able to detect weak asymmetries in the hydrogen line wide wings .",
    "the asymmetric components were in emission and moved in anti - phase to the primary component motion permitting an estimate of @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we show that this determination does not agree with our entirely independent analysis based on the measured value of @xmath0 and the assumptions of the solid - body , synchronous rotation for the primary component .",
    "determination are marked.,width=264 ]",
    "the analysis presented here is based on the collection of 105 spectra obtained within the program of @xcite on january 8 , 2001 using the 8 m eso telescope and the uves spectrograph .",
    "the observations became available to the author through the kindness of dr .",
    "t.  rauch ; they are accessible through the european southern observatory ( eso ) archives .",
    "the spectra were obtained in a somewhat cloudy weather ( roughly 50% changes in the air transparency ) , over slightly more than one orbital cycle of the star , starting at orbital phases of the secondary eclipse ( the hot star in front ) .",
    "the exposures were taken at equal intervals of 3.75 minutes .",
    "the nominal resolving power was @xmath15 , corresponding to 6.2 km  s@xmath2 ( for a gaussian profile , @xmath16 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the wavelength sampling of the spectra was 0.015  i.e.  about 1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "although the aa  dor spectra have been fully reduced through the eso pipeline and expressed in the heliocentric radial velocity system , no standard or calibration star spectra were provided .",
    "the remaining details are given in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the rectified spectrum aa  dor , the first of the 105 used ; the average spectrum of aa  dor formed from the same observations is shown magnified in figure  2 of @xcite .",
    "the latter figure was used as a guidance during rectification of the spectra because the raw data showed relatively large , wave - like intensity variations of the order of 50% along the covered wavelength range .    of note in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] are the very wide hydrogen lines extending in radial velocities over a few thousand km / s .",
    "the only obviously sharp and relatively deep ( about 20  % depth ) line is the he  ii 4686   line .",
    "this line was used by @xcite for a detailed modelling of the rotational broadening ; however the intrinsic factors of the fine structure splitting and of a large thermal broadening ( light atoms ) gave only moderate quality results for the important quantity of the projected rotational velocity @xmath0 .",
    "for that reason , we used much shallower but sharper lines of mg  ii 4482   and si  iv 4089   in our determination of @xmath0 ( sections  [ out - of - ecl ]  [ observed ] ) .",
    "the extensive analysis of the eso / uves spectral series by @xcite , while consistent with that of @xcite , has not improved our knowledge of the system beyond providing the well defined value of @xmath17 km  s@xmath2 and a much less well defined @xmath18 km  s@xmath2 ( note that the latter quantity has the error one hundred times larger than the former ) .",
    "it is not clear if the latter value is the aspect - corrected one ; @xcite used @xmath19 km  s@xmath2 . assuming a plausible range of the masses for the primary , @xmath20 , and the value of @xmath3 as above",
    ", @xcite arrived at @xmath21 for the invisible object .",
    "while this was the best that could be derived , it definitely requires confirmation .",
    "we show in this paper that a targeted determination of @xmath0 may indicate a rather different set of absolute parameters of aa  dor .    recently , after the analysis for this paper was concluded , a new determination of the rotational velocity of aa  dor appeared @xcite .",
    "it is based on a detailed analysis of far ultraviolet spectra from the fuse satellite .",
    "the new value is substantially smaller than used before , @xmath22 km  s@xmath2 , and better agrees with the results of this paper .",
    "however , our analysis uses a very different approach and results in a smaller uncertainty so it is useful as an entirely independent determination .",
    "the eclipsing binary system aa  dor has an excellent light - curve solution and the relative sizes of components are very well known @xcite . yet",
    ", the physical scale of the system , which is needed for derivation of the masses requires not only the easily measurable semi - amplitude @xmath3 but also information on the motion of the secondary component .",
    "although an estimate of @xmath5 has been recently found @xcite , it may be biased as it was derived from tiny spectral - line asymmetries .",
    "instead , we propose to utilize as the second quantity the value of the projected equatorial velocity of the primary star , @xmath0 .",
    "one can then estimate the mass ratio of the system , @xmath23 , and obtain a full description of the binary system in _ physical units _ by making the two assumptions about the primary component : ( 1 )  the solid - body rotation and ( 2 )  the perfect rotation ",
    "orbital motion synchronism .",
    "the ratio of the projected equatorial velocity to the observed orbital semi - amplitude , @xmath24 relates the relative size of the visible star ( @xmath25 ) to the relative size of its orbit .",
    "this can be used to determine @xmath26 and then @xmath27 .    while @xmath3 is relatively easy to find for aa  dor ,",
    "@xmath0 has been poorly determined .",
    "we attempt to determine @xmath0 first by direct fits to the spectral line profiles ( section  [ out - of - ecl ] ) and then by modelling of the line profile variations during eclipses of the primary ( section  [ eclipse ] ) .     and",
    "the line profiles are shown inverted with the vertical scale representing the depth of the line relative the local continuum .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "there are very few sharp lines in the spectrum of aa  dor ( the full spectrum of aa  dor is shown in figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the only visibly sharp and deep ( 20% ) line is the he  ii 4686   line .",
    "the lines of mg  ii 4481   and si  iv 4089 have depths of about 4  5% .",
    "other sharp lines are either interstellar or appear in the uv part of the spectrum where their groups would require detailed modelling of the mutual overlap and blending .",
    "the he  ii 4686   line was modelled in detail by @xcite providing determinations of @xmath3 and of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the line does not look rotationally broadened at all ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) so direct rotation profile fits are expected to give biased results . in spite of this , all",
    "97 out - of - eclipse line profiles for this line were fitted by by the standard rotation profile ( assuming the limb darkening of @xmath28 which is appropriate for the high temperature of the star ) to provide orbital velocities of the visible star and repeated determinations of @xmath0 .",
    "the orbital solution for a circular orbit is : @xmath29 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath30 .",
    "because there were no standard star observations to relate to , the centre of mass velocity was determined but later adjusted to zero by the choice of the reference wavelength , @xmath31 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the mean standard errors have been determined by the bootstrap sampling and are more realistic than ones given by the formal least - squares linear estimates . for the eclipse profile",
    "fits , we used a slightly different @xmath32 which is based on the weighted mean of the orbital solutions for the he  ii line and the mg  ii line ( see below ) .",
    "relative to the values given by @xcite , the adopted @xmath3 is slightly larger by 0.2 km  s@xmath2 but has a four times larger ( and probably more realistic ) error . the value of @xmath33 is shifted forward by 0.0012 d. the variable @xmath33 was included in the solution to account for an ( unlikely ) chance of spots or other asymmetries manifesting themselves only spectroscopically ; obviously , an addition of one additional degree of freedom can only lower the quality of @xmath0 determination , but was done to stay conservative with the determination .",
    "the value of the formally obtained rotation profile width of the he  ii line is @xmath34 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the error of the single determination is 1.5 km  s@xmath2 and error of the mean of 97 determinations is some ten times smaller ; however , such an error of the mean estimate would not make allowance for the systematic departures of the fit and would reflect only the consistently same shape of the line profile at all phases .",
    "thus , we do not attach too much significance to the formal errors and note that the determination of @xmath0 is large ; it obviously combines genuine rotation with other sources of broadening .",
    "the spectrograph resolution is characterized by @xmath35 km  s@xmath2 so that the dominant effect must come from the natural broadening of the he  ii line .",
    "the he ions are light so that for the temperature of the aa  dor primary , the doppler thermal widths is expected to be relatively large , @xmath36 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the line additionally shows multiple components of the fine structure splitting , as discussed in @xcite , but even these two effects combined are not large enough .",
    "this indicates that the he  ii 4686   line , in spite of its sharp appearance  at least compared with the hydrogen lines  is not sharp enough for a @xmath0 determination .",
    "the mg  ii 4481   and si  iv 4089   lines are expected to be sharper than the helium line because their thermal doppler broadening is @xmath37 km  s@xmath2 . when combined with the spectrograph resolution , we may expect their natural profile to have a width of @xmath38 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the mg  ii 4481   line is indeed much sharper than the he  ii line ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) and its broadening does appear to be dominated by rotation .",
    "fits of the rotational profile to the line profiles outside of the eclipse gave @xmath39 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath40 km  s@xmath2 ; for the latter quantity the formal error of a single determination is 3.4 km  s@xmath2 and does not include any systematic deviations in the @xmath0 fits .",
    "the third of the considered lines , si  iv 4089  , is located on the wide and curved wing of the h-@xmath41 line .",
    "the raw spectra had a sensitivity dip in this region by some 1/3 of the highest counts with an associated increase in the noise .",
    "the line is also slightly shallower than the mg  ii 4481   line . for these reasons we would consider results for this line as less reliable than those for the mg  ii 4481   line .",
    "individual fits of the rotational profiles to all out - of - eclipse si  iv line profiles gave @xmath42 km  s@xmath2 , with the formal error of a single determination of 2.4 km  s@xmath2",
    ". the small value of @xmath0 may be partly due to the distortion of the baseline by the h-@xmath41 line wing , but indicates that this quantity can not be large .    to summarize : the value of @xmath0 estimated from direct line - profile fits to the mg  ii 4481   and si  iv",
    "4089 lines is @xmath43 and @xmath44 km  s@xmath2 , respectively , with the latter determination much less reliable than the former .",
    "the fits for the he  ii 4686   line gave entirely unreliable results apparently due to strong natural broadening of the line . in the next sections",
    ", we will address the matter of separation of the natural broadening contribution from the @xmath0 estimates through utilization of the line - profile variations during eclipses .     while the y - axis is in arbitrary units but with the profiles normalized to give the same integral for all phases .",
    "the profiles have been calculated for eight observed phases as given by numbers in each panel .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "for determination of @xmath0 , one can utilize the spectral line profile variations as the secondary component of aa  dor scans the velocity field of the eclipsed sdob component . because the geometry of the binary is fully defined in the relative units of the mean separation , the line profile variations are relatively easy to predict for the case of the eclipsed body rotating as a solid - body , rotationally - synchronized star .",
    "the theoretical line profile variations during the eclipse ( profiles called @xmath45 below ) calculated by direct integration over the uneclipsed portion of the primary star disk are shown for 8 eclipse phases of aa  dor in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the x - axis in figure  [ fig3 ] is in units of @xmath0 which is the free parameter of the problem .",
    "the profiles were computed for the limb darkening coefficient of @xmath28 and then normalized to the total intensity of unity .",
    "this normalization is appropriate when the continuum for each phases is rectified and normalized to unity .",
    "the line profile variations are predicted to be enormous , a fact which may be used to determine the value of @xmath0 .",
    "such a determination would be independent of the out - of - eclipse line - shape fits which by necessity combine two similarly acting contributions of rotation and of natural line broadening .",
    "the observed profile , @xmath46 , can be modelled by assuming that it is a convolution of the theoretical eclipse profile , @xmath47 ( such as in figure  [ fig3 ] ) , but shifted by the predicted orbital velocity of the primary mass centre @xmath48 and stretched with the x - axis scale depending on @xmath0 ) with a natural - broadening profile , @xmath49 : @xmath50 the natural broadening is here meant to signify any contributions not related to rotation and thus not sensitive to eclipses , such as a combination of the doppler thermal broadening with the spectrograph finite resolution . in the equation above",
    ", the integration variable is the radial velocity , @xmath51 , while @xmath52 is for any parameters used to describe the natural line broadening .",
    "the natural broadening can be assumed , for example , to be the velocity doppler broadening @xmath53 , with the dispersion linked to the effective temperature @xmath54 and the atomic mass of the ion @xmath55 through @xmath56 .",
    "fits of the @xmath57 profiles to the observed ones must be done for all eclipse phases simultaneously , with ( 1 )  the same profile @xmath58 ( given explicitly or described by , say , a single parameter of the doppler width ) , ( 2 )  a value of @xmath0 and ( 3 )  one scaling factor ( when @xmath45 is normalized to unit strength ) . with only three free parameters , the problem is a relatively simple one in terms of the parametric description , but somewhat complex for a solution because of the non - linear properties of the convolution operation .",
    "we describe below results of least - squares , non - linear fits for two spectral lines of he  ii 4686   and mg  ii 4482  .",
    "variations of the si  iv 4089   line were not modelled because of the curved baseline around this line caused by the h@xmath41 wings and by the generally poorer definition of the spectrum in this region .",
    "the he  ii 4686   line profile variations during the eclipse ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) are very unlike what is expected ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the natural broadening of this line totally dominates over the rotational broadening .",
    "the eclipse variations are almost invisible and the observed line  except for small centroid shifts and some changes in the overall width",
    " looks practically the same at all eclipse phases . in a least - squares solution ,",
    "the broadening profile had a tendency to evolve to a large value of @xmath59 km  s@xmath2 , with a very large uncertainty of @xmath60 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "for such a choice , the best value of the rotational broadening is @xmath61 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the fits are reasonably good , but ( 1 )  because the eclipse effects are basically not present , the two broadenings simply combine ( as they do outside of the eclipses ) ; ( 2 )  the estimates of @xmath62 and @xmath0 are strongly anti - correlated with each determined to at best @xmath60 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we note that we have no explanation for the large width of the natural profile .",
    "this result casts a doubt on the previous determination of @xmath19 km  s@xmath2 utilizing the he  ii 4686   line @xcite and points at a need to use a narrower line .",
    "however , it agrees well with the recent determination of @xcite of @xmath63 km  s@xmath2 from the fuse data .",
    "the mg  ii 4481   line ( figure  [ fig5 ] gave the most reliable results .",
    "the linearized least - squares fits resulted in the doppler width @xmath64 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath65 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the error estimates were obtained through bootstrap experiments over the whole ensemble of several thousand of data points ; separate experiments utilizing re - sampling at the level of whole individual spectra suggest larger errors , @xmath66 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we note that the natural width is again substantially larger than expected .    .",
    "the global fit utilized only three free parameters ( the best values in parentheses ) : ( 1 )  the natural , gaussian broadening profile ( @xmath67 km  s@xmath2 ) , ( 2 )  @xmath0 ( 35 km  s@xmath2 ) and ( 3 )  a common scaling factor .",
    "the x - axis is in the observed radial velocities shifted to an arbitrary zero point while the y - axis gives the inverted depth of the line .",

    "the derived parameters are @xmath68 km  s@xmath2 and the natural gaussian broadening with @xmath69 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "note that the vertical scale is much expanded relative to figure  [ fig4 ] so that the noise is strongly visible , but that the horizontal scale is the same directly showing the lesser broadening of the mg  ii 4481   line .",
    "note also the detailed changes of this line , particularly for the central eclipse phases ( panels 4 and 5 ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    the adopted @xmath0 for the visible star , determined as a weighted mean of our determinations , is @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the estimate of the uncertainty takes into account the fact that the out - of - eclipse @xmath0 determinations in section  [ out - of - ecl ] are biased by the contribution of the instrumental as well as of the uncertain natural broadening ; accordingly , they were given a low weight .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath62 that we were able to estimate from the line - profile eclipse variations turned larger than expected .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is reduced by about one quarter relative to the previous determination of @xcite ( 43 km  s@xmath2 ) and is even smaller than the more recent determination of @xcite ( 35 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this  together with the assumptions of the solid body , synchronous rotation  leads to different orbital parameters of aa  dor than estimated before .",
    "this is discussed below .",
    ".parameters of aa  dor [ tab_param ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "having the value of @xmath0 , we can determine the mass ratio @xmath26 from eq .  [ eq1 ] and then @xmath5 . with the assumed inclination of the orbit from @xcite , the resulting parameters of the binary system are as listed in table  [ tab_param ] .",
    "note that in table  [ tab_param ] , we assumed a four times larger @xmath3 error than in the previous solutions , in accordance with the spread in the solutions based on the same data , as given in this paper and in @xcite . this way , the disparity of errors of @xmath3 and @xmath0 appears to be more acceptable than in @xcite where they differed by a factor of one hundred times ( 0.05 and 5 km  s@xmath2 , respectively ) .",
    "the solution as in table  [ tab_param ] gives the mass of the primary sdob component , @xmath6 , well outside the previously assumed and deemed plausible range of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this is not entirely surprising because the primary of aa  dor is thought to be a core of a much more massive star which underwent stripping in a common - envelope episode .",
    "in contrast to the primary , the parameters of the secondary component are surprisingly `` normal '' : with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , this object appears to fully obey the mass  radius relation expected for brown dwarfs . in the recent discussion of the mass  radius relation by @xcite only two objects with well determined parameters",
    "happen to be located in the domain between the main sequence stars and jupiter - like planets : hat  p2b and corot3b .",
    "the secondary of aa  dor appears at the very minimum of the radius in this relation , see figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "while we are satisfied by the results , there is a problem : they do not agree with the new determination of @xcite .",
    "their direct estimate of @xmath71 km  s@xmath2 is substantially larger than our @xmath72 km  s@xmath2 so that both masses are larger than ours ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "it is hard to imagine that the value derived by @xcite is in some way biased by the illumination effect as then one would actually expect a _ reduction _ in @xmath5 ; however , the way how @xmath5 was estimated  through small line - profile asymmetries  does leave a wide margin of systematic uncertainty .",
    "our determination of the absolute parameters of aa  dor totally depends on the strong assumptions of the solid - body , synchronous rotation of the primary component . if any of these are not fulfilled , then our analysis is entirely invalid .",
    "the solid - body rotation assumption is  in principle ",
    "verifiable through analysis of the line - profile variations , but the current data are not accurate enough .",
    "we note that with the commonly agreed @xmath3 and with the new @xmath5 by @xcite , the expected @xmath75 km  s@xmath2 , and this is entirely ruled out by our analysis .",
    "so , either our assumptions on the primary component rotation are invalid or the determination of @xcite is biased . the case of aa  dor is still not closed .",
