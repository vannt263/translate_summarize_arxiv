    "therefore the vacuum configuration can be interpreted as myers dielectric effect making @xmath6 m2-branes puff up into a fuzzy sphere .    in the latter half of this paper , we assumed a polarized m2-brane configuration .",

    "we find that these bps topological / non - topological solitons preserve 1/4 of the manifest @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "because these solutions can exist only in the @xmath252 case , these configurations are supported against collapse by the non - zero background flux @xmath5 .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the massive blg model where various bps soliton solutions are possible @xcite .",
    "a comment on the number of supersymmetries is in order . in the massless abjm model , @xmath18 global symmetry together with @xmath41 symmetry",
    "gives @xmath44 implying the existence of @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , the explicit on - shell @xmath0 supersymmetry transformation of component fields was found .",
    "our case is similar to the massless abjm model .",

    "these two @xmath39s are combined into an @xmath76 which would imply an enhancement of @xmath2 supersymmetry to @xmath253 .",
    "presumably , this supersymmetry is enhanced to the maximal one since our deformation term ( [ mass_superpot ] ) ( together with its conjugate term ) does not break the @xmath254 and @xmath59 symmetries and these are combined with the @xmath39s giving @xmath255 symmetry as discussed in @xcite .",
    "although we do not present it here , it would be possible to explicitly find the enhanced supersymmetries by the noether method or requiring that the supersymmetry algebra closes .",
    "another important issue is the understanding of the solution in the dual spherical m5-brane world - volume picture . because our effective potential is identified with the radius potential of the spherical m5-brane in the presence of the anti - self - dual 4-form flux , the bps solutions discussed in this paper correspond to bps configurations of this spherical m5-brane .",
    "it seems possible to find these bps configurations by promoting the constant radius @xmath86 in ( [ radial_potential ] ) to a `` field '' @xmath256 on the m2-brane world - volume and solving the bps equations obtained from the promoted spherical m5-brane action .",
    "this issue is beyond the scope of this paper and we leave it for future work .",
    "finally , let us comment on the dimensional reduction of the abjm model .",
    "since the abjm model describes @xmath6 coincident m2-branes in eleven dimensions , once we compactify one direction along the m2-brane world - volume , the model should describe the low energy effective theory of @xmath6 coincident fundamental strings ( f1 ) in type iia string theory .",
    "this theory is similar to the matrix string theory @xcite representing a polarization of the f1 due to the background flux .",
    "the configuration corresponding to the m2-branes polarized into the m5-brane now reduces to fundamental strings polarized into a d4-brane . the anti - self - dual 4-form flux in eleven - dimensions",
    "is reduced to the anti - self - dual rr 4-form flux in ten - dimensions .",
    "the multiple f1 is polarized into a fuzzy @xmath3 due to this flux .",
    "since the potential terms both in the m5-brane action and the massive abjm model do not change under the dimensional reduction , the discussion in section 3 holds even for the d4/f1 case implying @xmath257 duality .    on the other hand",
    ", the effective lagrangian for the polarized m2-branes discussed in section 4 reduces to the one for the polarized f1 .",
    "one component of the gauge field @xmath147 becomes an auxiliary field after the dimensional reduction .",
    "the resultant theory is a new two dimensional bf - like theory .",
    "we find that this model is exactly the one studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the model exhibits @xmath258 supersymmetry in two - dimensions and have a bps domain wall solution .",
    "it would be interesting to examine this solution in terms of brane configurations in ten - dimensions .",
