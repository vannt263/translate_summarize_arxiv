    "there are two alternatives for magnetostriction measurements of bulk ferromagnetic materials : it can be measured either directly , as it was initially observed from deformation under the magnetic field , or by an inverse way measuring the magnetic anisotropy induced by mechanical stress applied to the sample @xcite . in thin films",
    "the magnetostriction deformations are hindered by the substrate and only a secondary much smaller substrate deformation can be detected . by analogy to the bulk case , the direct technique uses the substrate deformation caused by the modification of the film magnetization . the inverse technique ( often called `` indirect ''",
    ", the term we find not very adequate ) implies studies of the thin film anisotropy changes caused by the deformation of the substrate ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "description of these techniques involves elastic properties of both the thin film and the substrate and , in particular for the direct technique , it took a long time to find the right equation to extract the magnetostriction parameters @xcite .",
    "the entire mechanical problem is so complex that even after the right solution was well established @xcite other contradicting theories are published @xcite .",
    "the theory for the inverse method appears to be simpler because the shape of the substrate is controlled directly and one can consider only the thin film properties .",
    "nevertheless , different expressions of the stress induced anisotropy can be found in different papers without a clear explanation of their origin @xcite .",
    "the difficulties come from an interplay between longitudinal and transverse deformations in response to uniaxial stresses related by poisson s ratio .",
    "the problem is crucial for applications of cantilevers as sensors and actuators where the role of the poisson s ratio was specially investigated @xcite .",
    "the rigorous solutions for the bimorphous plate bending includes so heavy and not transparent equations that for scientists of the magnetic community it is difficult to understand the reason why the poisson s ratios of the substrate and of the film appear in so different forms . at the same time the direct experimental verification of the theory is not convincing due to the fact that the parameters of thin films can vary significantly compared to the bulk ones @xcite .    in this paper without repeating the complete derivation we present simple criteria for choosing the correct equation in every practical case .",
    "we pay particular attention to the limits of the validity of known solutions and we carry out comparative measurements of magnetostriction of the _ same _ thin film sample using both direct and inverse techniques .",
    "already the existence of two `` alternative '' theories of the magnetostrictive effect creates some confusions .",
    "the anisotropic magnetostriction can be introduced in two ways .",
    "first , as the proper material deformations @xmath0 seen experimentally when the sample reaches the magnetic saturation ( traditional technical definition @xcite ) . in the simplest case of an isotropic material @xmath0 are related only to the magnetization direction ( @xmath1 axis in fig .",
    "[ fig_ms1]a ) and are given by a single magnetostrictive coefficient @xmath2 :    @xmath3    in the second approach the magnetostriction is defined as the proper stresses originating from internal magnetic interactions ( first principle approach @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_ms1]b).for an isotropic material : @xmath4    these definitions are equivalent providing that the internal magnetostrictive stresses @xmath5 produce elastic deformations equal to the magnetostrictive ones @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the poisson s ratio and @xmath8 is the young modulus .    in general , the initial magnetic state of the sample is not known and the only way to obtain the magnetostriction value is to saturate magnetization successively in two orthogonal directions ( say @xmath1 and @xmath9 ) and to measure the difference of deformation or stress between these two states ( i.e. @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) .",
    "the corresponding energy density of interaction between magnetostrictive deformation and elastic deformation ( magneto - elastic energy ) can be obtained from two equivalent general expressions : @xmath12 .",
    "very often the last expression is presented in a form where instead of @xmath13 terms of type @xmath14 are used , where @xmath15 is the angle between the magnetization and the i - axis @xcite .",
    "combining all together for our isotropic case we obtain the angular variation of the magnetoelastic energy density for magnetization rotation in the basal plane @xmath16 :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the angle between the magnetization and @xmath1 axis .    from this equation",
    "one can see that the physical meaning of @xmath19 referred usually as the magnetoelastic coupling constant represents the characteristic magnetostrictive stress @xmath20 illustrated in figure [ fig_ms1 ] : @xmath21 .",
    "the relative deformation @xmath22 defined as the magnetostriction constant @xmath2 is accompanied by half smaller opposite transverse deformations @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the case of positive @xmath2 when the initial cube of isotropic material is transformed to the elongated parallelepiped is shown .",
    "b ) alternatively the origin of magnetostriction can be defined trough the appearance of internal stresses @xmath25 , @xmath26 which can be equilibrated by external stresses ( big white arrows ) @xmath27 to block the deformation of the material and , thus , to provide the elastic deformations opposite to the magnetostrictive ones .",

    "@xmath38 is the usual anisotropy constant .    by analogy with the bulk measurements",

    ".    a closer look to the problem shows that the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath46 may be different for different experiments and thus comparison of data obtained from different techniques is not so obvious . moreover not only direct and inverse experiments should be compared with care but also data obtained from the same technique should be treated differently depending on the geometry of the substrate bending in the given experiment",
    ".    in general , the young moduli and poisson s ratios of the substrate and of the film material are different and should be distinguished when used together .",
    "below we demonstrate how different algebraic forms of the poisson s ratio of the cantilever substrate @xmath48 enters to @xmath47 and @xmath46 in two characteristic cases : anticlastic bending and cylindrical bending .",
    "and we show in a simple way why the poisson s ratio of film @xmath49 and young moduli of both the substrate @xmath50 and the film @xmath51 appear always in the same form for all kind of deformations .",
    "one can easily understand the variety of these forms of @xmath7 ( @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) by reviewing characteristic cases of elementary deformations presented in appendix [ app_poisson ] .",
    "small bending of a cantilever in one direction inevitably induces an opposite bending in perpendicular direction in order to satisfy the absence of transversal stresses at its free side edges @xcite . in this case the principal surface deformation is followed by the transversal deformation as for an elastic element under uniaxial stress ( see configuration 1 in appendix [ app_poisson ] ) .",
    "these two opposite bending produces an anticlastic shape of the cantilever that can not develop simultaneously with increasing deformation .",
    "due to the corresponding geometrical constrains the process becomes non linear and a much more complicated deformation appears for large cantilever curvature .",
    "this effect is usually not considered in the papers on thin film magnetostriction while it can be non negligible as shown below .",
    "the conditions when bending can be considered small and the corresponding equations are linear can be found only in specialized papers on the mechanics of thin plates .",
    "the relevant critical parameter for thin cantilever with large length @xmath43 to width @xmath52 ratio is @xmath53 .",
    "the linear transversal anticlastic deformation across the sample width @xmath54 is valid when this value at the sample edge @xmath55 is less than about @xmath56 for @xmath57 i.e. @xmath58 ( see appendix [ app_antic ] ) .    at larger @xmath59",
    "the anticlastic profile can not progress anymore in the same way because an additional edge axial tension created by it can no longer be neglected .",
    "the shape of the plate flattens and for @xmath60 one can consider the bending as purely cylindrical .",
    "another case of the cylindrical bending is when transverse deformation is blocked near to the sample fixed end by the support ( clamping effect @xcite ) .",
    "an immediate consequence of the fixed transversal deformations is the appearance of the transversal stresses @xmath61 ( configuration 2 in appendix [ app_poisson ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that both the effective elasticity coefficient of the plate bending @xmath47 and the coupling coefficient @xmath46 between the bending and the magnetostrictive stress in the film are different in these two limit cases . + pure bending in the principal cantilever direction @xmath1 produces the longitudinal elastic deformations @xmath62 ( see fig .",

    "this gives @xmath66 .",
    "the magnetoelastic coupling energy of the thin film with planar magnetization is fully determined by the surface deformation of the much thicker substrate :    @xmath67    that gives @xmath68 . thus expression ( [ equ_keff ] ) of the effective magnetic anisotropy for inverse magnetostriction measurements in the anticlastic case includes the poisson s ratio of the substrate in the form @xmath69 .    from eq .",

    ", it has no practical application because in direct measurements the cantilever curvature is extremely small ( @xmath79 ) and clamping effect can be neglected for cantilevers with large @xmath80 ratio .",
    "one should note that the elastic deformation @xmath28 due to the plate bending is not the only deformation produced by the magnetostrictive stress during direct measurements of magnetostriction .",
    "this stress also changes the sample length creating homogeneous deformation @xmath81 .",
    "consequently the position of the neutral line  where total longitudinal deformation @xmath82  is shifted as discussed by many authors ( see for example @xcite . the elastic energy corresponding to this additional deformation does not interfere with the energy of the pure substrate bending and , thus eq .",

    "negative curvature produces the opposite effect : the uniaxial anisotropy , first , is reduced by the applied stress ( the slope of the short axis hysteresis loop is reduced by stress counterbalancing the initial anisotropy ) and , then , the easy anisotropy axis switches from longitudinal to transversal direction and the anisotropy increases again . in our sample",
    "we observe that this switching is not abrupt : the long axis hysteresis starts to slant before the short axis hysteresis becomes completely rectangular ( see fig .",

    ", we would observe an abrupt reversal between slanted and rectangular loops at the moment of 90@xmath40 rotation of the easy axis when the initial anisotropy is compensated by the stress induced anisotropy .",
    "in reality , as we indicated above ( fig . [",

    "there is an interval around the compensation point where @xmath92 can be formally measured for both directions .",

    "the expected linear variation of @xmath103 with curvature one has to consider only points outside the intermediate compensation region shaded gray in the figure . inside this region",
    "the slope is about twice smaller because the repartition between the areas with positive and negative @xmath92 also varies with curvature .",
    "so if this region is not identified the resulting magnetostriction value can be considerably reduced . the slope of the line fitting the points outside the compensation region @xmath104 oe.m @xmath105 allows us to determine the magnetoelastic coupling coefficient of the film @xmath19 .    as mentioned above for this measurement",

    "far from the support the deformation of the sample gets an anticlastic shape if the bending is not too strong ( see appendix [ app_antic ] ) .",

    "for the deformation being equivalent to the deformation of narrow cantilevers the magnetoelastic coefficient @xmath46 is by @xmath69 larger .",
    "correspondingly one have to use for this case another expression relating @xmath19 and the induced anisotropy :    @xmath110    in order to observe the effect of this shape modification we have carried out measurements at different points from the support .    moke hysteresis loops obtained for a given deformation @xmath111 , left column , and @xmath112 right column , when laser spot is swept along the sample length from a position close to the clamped tip ( @xmath113 ) to @xmath114 trough @xmath115 are presented fig .",

    "we observe the inversion of easy and hard direction at small @xmath1 where the induced anisotropy overcomes the initial one .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath92 varies from a negative to a positive value along the sample length .",
    "this transition is not abrupt similarly to the modification of @xmath92 as function of the bending curvature discussed above and there is an intermediate compensation area approximatively in the middle of the sample .",
    "we represent the evolution of the induced anisotropy along the sample length by the difference between @xmath92 obtained for positive ( @xmath120 ) and negative ( @xmath121 ) bending ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - hk(x ) ] ) . such presentation allows us to exclude the inhomogeneity of the initial anisotropy of the undeformed sample .",
    "we can distinguish two kinds of points : when @xmath120 and @xmath121 have different signs in the part of the sample close to the support ( open circles in the figure ) and when @xmath120 and @xmath121 remain both positive in the second part of the sample ( closed square in the figure ) .",
    "similarly to the evolution with @xmath31 discussed before these two kinds of points coexist in the intermediate compensation area and expected theoretical value should lie somewhere between them . except of the inconvenience caused by the sample inhomogeneity , there are two effects to be considered for quantitative analysis of these data : the effect of the support clamping and the edge blocking for large curvature .    the cylindrical shape imposed by the clamping at the support extends to some distance thus producing in this region the strengthening of its bending and the reduction of the induced anisotropy as discussed above ( see discussion before eq . ( [ equ_delta_cyl ] ) .",

    "the largest sample curvature considerably overcomes this value near to the support ( see fig . [",

    "( [ equ - kappa ] ) and fig .",

    "since @xmath31 reduces almost linearly along the sample length , the low curvature approximation can be used till maximal allowed bending only close to the sample free end ( @xmath132 ) where , unfortunately , the induced anisotropy is too small for precise measurements of the magnetostriction .",
    "thus , in the main part of the sample we have a complicated superposition of at least three effects : the compensation effect with the revealed inhomogeneous initial anisotropy , the clamping effect and the non linear shape effect .",
    "interestingly , our experimental measurements near to the cantilever support discussed above ( fig . [ fig : moke2 mm ] , [ fig - hk ] ) have no such complication .",

    "another important difference is that the substrate thickness enters as @xmath144 to the direct technique and as @xmath145 to the inverse one .",
    "eventual influence of the inhomogeneity on @xmath19 also can not be excluded : the direct technique provides the average value over the whole sample whereas the inverse technique measures a local value .",
