    "the same holds in @xmath2ca , where the introduction of tensor correlations and potentials increases the kinetic energy by @xmath228 mev , compensated by an additional potential energy contribution of @xmath229 mev , providing a bound nucleus in the @xmath212 case . for the sake of curiosity , we recall that the experimental binding energies per nucleon are @xmath230 mev in @xmath1o and @xmath231 mev in @xmath2ca , to be compared with the computed values @xmath232 mev ( @xmath1o ) and @xmath233 mev ( @xmath2ca ) .    in table viii",
    "we compare the expectation values of the components of the potential with the nuclear matter results , within the same fhnc / soc approximation and in the @xmath212 model .",
    "it is interesting to notice a kind of convergence with a for the potential energies , in particular for the large ope related components , whose contributions , in @xmath2ca , are already very close to the nuclear matter values . we stress that a more meaningful comparison would imply the use of hartree - fock single particle wave functions , or , at least , a minimization on the single particle potential parameters .    in table",

    "in general , they contribute for less than @xmath214 of the fhnc / soc value , with the exception of @xmath234 , where they give a @xmath235 contribution , actually worsening the agreement with cmc .",
    "the effects of the correlations on the ground state structure are shown in figures 2 and 3 , giving the obds and the two particle distribution functions , @xmath236 , defined as    @xmath237    where @xmath238 is the center of mass coordinate . in both figures , the @xmath212 , the jastrow and the independent particle models are compared    large parte of the reduction respect to the ipm is due to the jastrow , short range correlations .",
    "the operatorial correlations slightly enhance the obds , as in the first order cluster analysis of ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "they have the same effect in @xmath236 , where the dip at short distances is due to the repulsive core in the nuclear interaction , as already found for a=3,4 nuclei in ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "at the beginning of this section we have explained why we did not look for a variational minimum for the truncated version of u14 .",
    "however , it is certainly of interest to try to understand how reliable are the nuclear matter parameter values and how far they are from the true minimum .",
    "to this aim we have minimized , with respect to @xmath191 , the energy for the s3 model described in the introduction ( keeping the same harmonic oscillator wells as u14 ) .",
    "the results are displayed in table x. the first row corresponds to the u14 nuclear matter @xmath198 fm , whereas the second gives the computed minima .",
    "the minimization produces a small gain in the binding energy and s3 appears to provide two nuclei underbound of @xmath239 mev .",
    "in this article the fhnc technology developed in co1 to describe finite nuclear sistems has been extended to state dependent correlations containing up to tensor components . as in infinite nucleon matter",
    ", the non commutativity of the two body correlation operators does not allow for a complete fhnc treatement , which is instead possible for purely scalar , jastrow - type correlations . the single operator chain approximation scheme ( which is effectively employed in nuclear and neutron matter )",
    "has been extended to the finite case .",
    "the resulting set of integral equations has been solved either by neglecting the class of the elementary diagrams ( fhnc/0 approximation ) or by considering only the lowest order elementary contribution in the dynamical correlation ( fhnc-1 ) . as an application",
    ", we have studied the ground state properties of the doubly closed shell nuclei in the @xmath240 coupling scheme , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca , interacting by the central and tensor components of the realistic urbana @xmath0 nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "the analysis of the sum rules shows that the fhnc / soc equations provide a considerably accurate one - body density , whose normalization is violated by much less than @xmath241 .",
    "a comparably good accuracy is obtained for the normalization of the central component of the two - body density ( @xmath242 sum rule ) when tensor correlations are not included .",
    "if they are considered , then the excellent fullfiment of @xmath243 obtained with purely central correlations slightly worsens .",
    "the inclusion of the first order jastrow elementary diagram in fhnc-1 does not improve the outcome .",
    "the inclusion of the analogous diagrams , linear in the operatorial correlations , is presently under consideration . in any case ,",
    "the worst violation of the sum rule is @xmath244 , close to what was found in nuclear matter .",
    "a similar situation is met for the isospin saturation , @xmath245 , sum rule .",
    "the various energy contributions in @xmath1o have been compared with those obtained within the cluster monte carlo approach .",
    "the maximum disagreement with the cmc results varies from @xmath246 for the jastrow model to @xmath247 for the tensor model .",
    "the absolute error in the ground state energy per nucleon is always well less @xmath25 mev , compatible with the estimated accuracy of the fhnc / soc approach in nuclear matter at saturation density .",
    "the same truncated @xmath0 interaction has been also used to study the ground state of @xmath2ca .",
    "we have verified that for both @xmath1o and @xmath2ca only the insertion of the long range one pion exchange parts of the potential ( and related correlations ) binds the nuclei .",
    "no minimization along the correlation and single particle potential variational parameters has been carried on , but we have rather taken the nuclear matter values .",
    "we have postponed this task to future works , when a completely realistic hamiltonian will be within reach of our method . however , a partial minimization on the correlation healing distance , @xmath191 , for the simpler , central afnan and tang potential seems to point to little variation of the parameters in going from the infinite to the finite case .    even if this is still an intermediate step towards a full microscopic description of intermediate and heavy nuclei , our results are very promising .",
    "in fact , we may conclude that the fhnc / soc approach to finite nuclei shows at least the same degree of accuracy estimated in the best variational nuclear matter studies . in this respect , we consider as mandatory the inclusion of spin - orbit terms in both the interaction and correlation , as well as the extension to the @xmath248 coupling scheme , in order to cover all the range of the doubly closed shell nuclei .",

    "<S> we achieve in finite nuclei a treatment of non central interactions and correlations having , at least , the same level of accuracy as in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the way for a microscopic study of medium heavy nuclei ground state using present days realistic hamiltonians .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now a largely accepted fact that the wave function of strongly interacting nuclear systems shows large deviations from independent particle models ( ipm ) . </S>",
    "<S> these effects may be ascribed to the presence of correlations between the nucleons , coming from the nuclear interaction . </S>",

    "<S> if the spanned variational wave function space is large enough , then the description provided by a variational approach is quite accurate ( even if not exact ) . </S>",
