    "the standard model ( sm ) well describes particle physics below the electroweak energy scale . however , various theoretical considerations suggest that some extension of the sm be necessary for physics above that energy scale .",
    "various models therefore have been proposed , some of which being studied extensively . among them",
    "extensions with supersymmetry @xcite are considered most plausible . in particular , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is usually treated as their standard theory around the electroweak energy scale .",
    "the mssm inherits most of the successful features of the sm , while the extension being minimal .",
    "however , this model suffers one serious setback , which has been often passed over . in the sm",
    ", the proton is protected from decay naturally by gauge symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "in the mssm , the gauge symmetry allow the interactions of dimension four which do not conserve baryon and/or lepton numbers .",
    "unless there exists some reason to forbid these interactions , the proton decays in an unacceptably short time .",
    "therefore , a discrete symmetry is usually imposed on the mssm through @xmath1 parity , which is however merely an ad hoc symmetry .    a convincing reason for the proton stability could be provided by an extra gauge symmetry .",
    "although such a symmetry around the electroweak energy scale is subjected to many phenomenological constraints , they still show room to allow a u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "several supersymmetric models with an extra u(1 ) symmetry therefore have been discussed @xcite , aiming at natural explanation for a long lifetime of the proton . however , these models are accompanied by some arbitrariness in construction , which might reduce reliability of the reasoning for the proton stability .    in this paper , the supersymmetric extension of the sm with an extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry",
    "is studied within the framework of a model coupled to @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "in addition to the proton lifetime , the mssm involves problems on the neutrino masses and the linear coupling of higgs superfields noted later . requiring a model to solve these problems consistently in a minimal extension ,",
    "its particle contents and superpotential are determined rather uniquely @xcite . in sizable ranges of the model parameters",
    ", the scalar potential appropriately gives a vacuum of su(3)@xmath2u@xmath3(1 ) gauge symmetry below the electroweak energy scale .",
    "phenomenological predictions of the model are compatible with experimental results .",
    "a typical mass scale of scalar particles is of order 1 tev , which can account for the smallness of the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the neutron and the electron , another problem of the mssm .",
    "the energy dependencies of the model parameters are also discussed by analyzing renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "taking the masses - squared of scalar fields all positive at a high energy scale , those for some higgs fields become sufficiently small at lower energy scales to induce the breakdowns of the extra u(1 ) and electroweak gauge symmetries . in the model coupled to @xmath0 supergravity",
    "the masses - squared and the trilinear coupling constants for scalar fields are considered to respectively have universal values at a very high energy scale .",
    "this scenario can be realized in this model .    in constructing the model ,",
    "we take into account the problems of the neutrino masses and the higgs linear coupling as well as that of the proton stability .",
    "the former is raised by non - vanishing masses of the neutrinos suggested from experiments for atmospheric and solar neutrinos , such as at the super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "the mssm or the sm can have yukawa couplings for neutrino dirac masses , if right - handed neutrinos are naively included .",
    "however , these fields are inert for the transformations of the gauge groups and their existence is not prescribed by the model .",
    "furthermore , the extreme lightness of the neutrinos may require some explanation .",
    "although this lightness could be attributed to large majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos , their origin is not clarified .",
    "the latter problem is posed by a mass parameter of the @xmath4 term , a linear coupling of the higgs superfields in the superpotential of the mssm @xcite , which is indispensable for correct breaking of electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "this mass parameter @xmath4 should have a magnitude of order the electroweak energy scale .",
    "the other mass parameters in the model are traced back to supersymmetry - soft - breaking terms of the lagrangian and thus related to the gravitino mass which may be of order the electroweak energy scale . on the other hand , the @xmath4 parameter is contained in the supersymmetric term and its magnitude may be given arbitrarily .",
    "it is natural that there is no mass parameter in the superpotential and the role of the @xmath4 term is assumed by another effective @xmath4 term .",
    "these problems could also be solved by introducing an extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry . imposing a new gauge symmetry yields chiral and trace anomalies within the particle contents of the mssm . for canceling the anomalies ,",
    "new superfields are necessarily incorporated , among which those for right - handed neutrinos and an su(2)-singlet higgs boson may be included .",
    "the extra u(1 ) symmetry could be broken above the electroweak energy scale by a vacuum expectation value ( ) of this higgs boson , which may provide a source of majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos and the effective @xmath4 parameter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we construct a model , in which the proton is adequately stable , the ordinary neutrinos have non - vanishing but small masses , and the effective @xmath4 term is contained . in sect .",
    "3 the vacuum structure of the model is discussed , paying particular attention to experimental constraints on an extra neutral gauge boson . in sect .",
    "4 the behavior of the model parameters for different energy scales is analyzed through the rges to examine the radiative breaking of gauge symmetry and the supersymmetry breaking by @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in sect .",
    "particle contents of the model are constrained by the requirements of proton stability , neutrino masses , and an effective @xmath4 term .",
    "we also keep the extension of the sm as minimal as possible .",
    "the neutrino masses necessitate superfields for right - handed neutrinos , which are denoted by @xmath5 . for the effective @xmath4 term an su(3)@xmath2su(2)@xmath2u(1 ) singlet",
    "superfield @xmath6 is included .",

    "the number @xmath34 of pairs for @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the number @xmath35 for @xmath6 are determined by the freedom from chiral anomalies for @xmath36 , @xmath37 and a trace anomaly for u@xmath38(1 ) with eqs .",
