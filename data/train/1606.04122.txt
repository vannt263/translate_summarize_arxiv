    "fractals are an interesting mathematical structure and are gaining more attention day by day . a _",
    "fractal _ is a set that possesses a non - ending repeating pattern .",
    "a set may be formally defined as a fractal if its dimension is fractional .",
    "in addition to this , fractals hold many interesting properties .",
    "most fractals are self - similar , and can be defined either iteratively or recursively .",
    "the fractal dimension is mostly calculated using either the hausdorff dimension or box - counting dimension .",
    "the former one is more stable , but the latter is easier to calculate .",
    "these and other definitions of dimension can be seen in detail in @xcite .    for a bounded subset @xmath0 of @xmath1 , let @xmath2 denote the smallest number of boxes of side length @xmath3 covering @xmath0 .",
    "then , by @xcite the lower box - counting dimension of @xmath0 is defined as @xmath4 similarly , upper box - counting dimension of @xmath0 is given as @xmath5 the box - counting dimension of @xmath0 denoted as @xmath6 ( also known as box dimension or capacity dimension ) is then defined as @xmath7 there exists structures possessing rotataion of the portions being removed for which the existing definition of the box dimension using @xmath3-mesh cubes is hard to calculate . the aim of this paper is to deal with this problem by presenting an alternate definition of the box dimension , initially proposed by @xcite .",
    "this article extends the work of @xcite by providing a curve fitting comparison .    in",
    "the following section we provide an alternate definition of box dimension which will be used for a particular structure in section 3 .",
    "recall from that for a bounded subset @xmath0 of @xmath1 , @xmath8 ( as mentioned in @xcite ) can be any of the following :    * closed balls of radius @xmath3 that cover @xmath0 , * cubes of side @xmath3 that cover @xmath0 , * @xmath3-mesh cubes that intersect @xmath0 , * sets of diameter at most @xmath3 that cover @xmath0 , * disjoint balls of radius @xmath3 with centres in @xmath0 .    note that in ( i)-(iv ) , @xmath8 is the smallest number and in ( v ) the largest number of such sets .    for two - dimensional objects ,",
    "the box dimension is usually calculated using @xmath3-mesh squares .",
    "the following theorem as mentioned in @xcite proposes a new variant of the box counting dimension using @xmath3-mesh triangles .",
    "for this , let @xmath9 denote the number of right - angled triangles of side length @xmath3 having non - empty intersection with @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded subset of @xmath10 .",
    "the lower and upper box - counting dimensions of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath9 are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 moreover , if limit exists , we have the box - counting dimension as @xmath13    the proof is similar to the proof for @xmath2 as for ( iii ) in @xcite .    consider the @xmath3-mesh squares of the form @xmath14 \\times [ n \\delta , ( n + 1 ) \\delta],\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are integers .",
    "clearly each square gives rise to two right angled ( isoceles ) triangles each of shorter side @xmath3 and longer side @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath9 be the number of squares and triangles , respectively , covering @xmath0 .",
    "then , @xmath18 since the collection @xmath2 gives rise to @xmath3-squares of diameter @xmath19 , it can be obviously seen that the collection of sets @xmath20 covering @xmath0 gives the relation @xmath21 assuming that @xmath22 is sufficiently small we have @xmath23 thus , @xmath24 taking limits as @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath26 and @xmath27 now , any set of diameter at most @xmath3 is contained in @xmath28-mesh cubes .",
    "thus , @xmath29 taking logarithms , we will get @xmath30 letting @xmath31 , we obtain the other side , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 hence , the box - counting dimension can equivalently be defined using a collection of @xmath3-mesh triangles .",
    "in this section we consider a spiral as a fractal . the construction of the spiral is taken from @xcite and is assigned the named bradley spiral. the portions being removed from the initial set follow rotation , resulting in the spiral shape .",
    "the construction is as follows :    consider a closed unit square @xmath34 .",
    "contruct a square @xmath35 inscribed in @xmath34 by joining the midpoints of each side of @xmath34 .",
    "this produces four right - angled isoceles triangles with length of shorter side @xmath36 .",
    "remove the upper right triangle , say @xmath37 , keeping the boundary of the longer side ( i.e. the boundary intersecting with @xmath35 ) .",
    "similarly to the previous step , form a square @xmath38 inscribed in @xmath35 , yielding four right - angled isoceles triangles with length of shorter side @xmath39 .",
    "remove the right triangle , say @xmath40 , and remove the boundary intersecting with @xmath37 ( keeping the other two ) . in the third stage ,",
    "a square @xmath41 inscribed in @xmath38 is formed by joining the midpoints of each side of @xmath38 .",
    "this leaves four right - angled isoceles triangles with length of shorter side @xmath42 .",
    "remove the lower right triangle , say @xmath43 , and the boundary intersecting with @xmath40 .",
    "continuing iteratively , at the @xmath44-th stage , a square @xmath45 inscribed in @xmath46 is formed yielding four right - angled isoceles triangles with length of shorter side @xmath47 .",
    "one triangle , say @xmath48 , is removed along with the boundary of @xmath48 intersecting with @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the triangles removed form a spiral and the resulting set is named the bradley spiral , and is denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "figure 1 shows first three steps and the pattern obtained at @xmath44-th step of the bradley spiral .",
    "now , we calculate the box dimension of the bradley spiral in terms of triangles .",
    "[ figure-1 ]    the bradley spiral has box dimension @xmath51 .    at the @xmath44-th stage , _ s _ is covered by @xmath52 @xmath3-mesh triangles of length @xmath53 .",
    "then by @xmath54 observe that for large @xmath44 , @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 \\notag \\\\ & = 2 .",
    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we present an algorithm for calculating the box dimension using triangle mesh of the bradley spiral , and also show a curve fitting comparison for the box dimension for both the triangle mesh and the square mesh .    for the algorithm",
    ", we choose equal spacing for triangle meshes @xmath57 .",
    "the implementation is straight forward in matlab using the @xmath58 and @xmath59 matlab commands .",
    "we have also verified the results for numerically and the corresponding algorithm is given below :      we now discuss the curve fitting for the box dimension for both the triangle mesh and the square mesh .",
    "the curve fitting here is computed from the linear least - square regression obtained for the triangle and square mesh and presented in figure 2 .",
    "we observe that the value for @xmath60 is found to increase linearly with an increase in @xmath61 , which is in good agreement with the linear least - square regression curve .",
    "further , it is to be noted that , in case of the square mesh the change in @xmath3 is greater than in the triangle mesh .      in conclusion",
    ", we observe that , for structures involving rotation , this alternate definition of the box dimension is easier to calculate and gives more accurate results than the box dimension using square mesh",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the box dimension of other two dimensional fractals using this proposed definition .",
    "further , generalization of this idea to @xmath1 is still an open problem .",
