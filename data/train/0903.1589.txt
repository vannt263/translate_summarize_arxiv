    "the collisionless , cold dark matter ( dm ) particles that constitute the gravitationally dominant component of galaxy clusters are distributed in a ` halo ' embedding the electromagnetically active baryons .",
    "the halo development under self - gravity from small density perturbations has been focused by several recent @xmath4-body simulations , with three main outcomes .",
    "first , the growth is recognized ( zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; hoffman et al . 2007 ;",
    "diemand et al .",
    "2007 ) to comprise two cosmogonic stages : an early fast collapse including a few violent major mergers building up the halo ` body ' ; a later , quasi - equilibrium stage where the outskirts develop from the inside - out by minor mergers and smooth accretion ( see salvador - sol et al .",
    "the _ transition _ occurs at the redshift @xmath10 when a dm gravitational well attains its maximal depth , or the radial peak of the circular velocity @xmath11 its maximal height ( see li et al .",
    "this sharp definition of halo ` formation ' also marks the time for the early gravitational turmoil to subside .",
    "second , the ensuing quasi - equilibrium structure is effectively expressed in terms of the functional @xmath12 that combines the density @xmath13 and the radial velocity dispersion @xmath14 in the form of a dm ` entropy ' ( or rather ` adiabat ' ; see bertschinger 1985 , taylor & navarro 2001 , hoffman et al .",
    "2007 , vass et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this mimics the behavior of a thermodynamic entropy in that it increases in the halo bodies during the fast collapses and stays put during the subsequent quiet accretion .",
    "third , the simple run @xmath15 is empirically found to hold in the settled halo bodies , with slopes around @xmath16 ( see navarro et al .",
    "this apparently universal halo feature allows recasting the pressure @xmath17 in terms of the density , to balance self - gravity for the equilibrium .    as to the latter",
    "we have used the isotropic jeans equation to derive the ` @xmath0-_profiles _ ' for dm quantities like @xmath1 and @xmath2 , having ascertained that @xmath0 is to lie within the narrow range @xmath18 from a state - of - the - art semianalytic study of the cosmogonic halo development , see lapi & cavaliere ( 2009 , hereafter lc09 ) .    in this _ letter _",
    "we first refine these profiles to conditions of developing outskirts and anisotropic velocity dispersion ; then we test them against recent data that join observations of strong and weak gravitational lensing ( gl ) .",
    "our framework will be provided by the standard @xmath9-cosmology , i.e. , a flat universe with normalized matter density @xmath19 , dark energy density @xmath20 , and hubble constant @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 . to bridge the matter- to the dark energy - dominated era across the cosmological crossover at @xmath23",
    ", we shall express the redshift - time relation @xmath24 in terms of the parameter @xmath25 growing from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the evolutions of the current bounding radius @xmath28 , of the circular velocity @xmath29 , and of the entropy @xmath30 are obtained by lc09 in terms of the halo mass @xmath31 and its growth rate @xmath32 from the simple scaling laws @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . whence straightforward algebra leads to express the entropy slope @xmath36 as @xmath37 in terms of the inverse growth rate @xmath38 .",
    "with @xmath39 marking the cosmogonic transition from fast to slow accretion as gauged on the running hubble timescale , it is seen from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that the range @xmath40 will apply to average halos that began their slow accretion in the corresponding interval @xmath41 .",
    "the range of @xmath0 is narrow as the evolution of @xmath42 is _ slower _ than for @xmath43 and @xmath44 separately , which explains why closely similar values of @xmath0 are found in the halo bodies from different simulations .",
    "such a behavior is checked and refined in terms of the detailed evolution of @xmath43 ; its _ average _ evolutionary track is obtained from integrating for @xmath45 the differential equation @xmath46 with the state - of - the - art _ kernel _ detailed in appendix a of lc09 .",
    "we illustrate as red lines in fig .  1 our outcomes for an average cluster with current overall mass @xmath47 ; we plot the redshift evolution of the mass @xmath48 , of the circular velocity @xmath49 , of the entropy slope @xmath50 .",
    "note that our approach , which includes ellipsoidal collapse of the body and outskirts growth controlled by @xmath9 , renders the peaked behavior of @xmath51 in remarkable agreement with the detailed simulations . for @xmath52",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath53 , the entropy slope at @xmath10 is around @xmath54 , and the outskirts are currently rudimentary .",
    "but considerable _ variance _ arises from the stochastic nature of the individual growth histories . as an example of variant , early _ biased _",
    "track we focus on the one associated with the ` main progenitor ' that constitutes the main branch of a merging tree ( illustrated , e.g. , in cavaliere & menci 2007 , their fig .  1 ) .",
    "such a history obtains from the same eq .",
    "( 2 ) , with the lower integration limit replaced by @xmath55 ; the results for a _ current _ mass @xmath56 are shown as blue lines in fig .  1 .",
    "relative to the average , this history features a higher transition redshift @xmath57 , a less massive body with @xmath58 , an entropy slope @xmath6 , and currently extensive outskirts .",
    "we find the occurrence of such biased halos relative to the average to be @xmath59 on integrating the kernel of eq .",
    "( 2 ) over the corresponding two histories .",
    "an imprint of the transition redshift @xmath10 is provided by the concentration parameter @xmath60 , that in overall terms scales as @xmath61^{1/3}$ ] ; in fact , zhao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and wechsler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) describe its increase for @xmath62 with the approximation @xmath63 , adopted in the bottom right panel of our fig .",
    "it is seen that for the average history the present concentration reads @xmath64 , while for the main progenitor it takes on values @xmath8 .    from overall halo development",
    "we turn now to profiles for the equilibrium following the transition time .",
    "physical profiles are derived from the above values of @xmath0 inserted into the radial jeans equation , with pressure @xmath65 and anisotropy described in terms of the standard binney ( 1978 ) parameter @xmath66 . in terms of the density slope",
    "@xmath67 jeans may be recast to read @xmath68 when supplemented with the mass definition @xmath69 entering @xmath29 , this constitutes an integro - differential equation for @xmath1 , that by double differentiation reduces to a handy @xmath70 order differential equation for @xmath71 ( austin et al . 2005 , dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ) .    with @xmath72 const and @xmath73 ( meaning isotropy )",
    ", lc09 found that physical solutions , that we named @xmath0-profiles , exist for @xmath74 ; the corresponding density runs steepen monotonically outwards and satisfy physical central and outer boundary conditions , respectively : a round minimum of the potential along with a round maximum of the pressure ; a finite ( hence definite ) overall mass . in fig .  2 we report as dashed lines the @xmath0-_profiles _ for various quantities : density @xmath1 , mass @xmath75 , circular velocity @xmath76 , and velocity dispersion @xmath2 .",
    "the behavior of the density run ( top left panel of fig .",
    "2 ) is highlighted by the analytic expressions of the slopes @xmath77 these start with the central ( @xmath78 ) value @xmath79 , progressively steepen to @xmath80 at the point @xmath81 that marks the halo main body , and steepen further into the outskirts to the value @xmath82 .",
    "monotonic behavior and physical boundary conditions for the @xmath0-profiles are seen ( cf .",
    "lc09 ) to imply a maximal value @xmath83 in the body , at the point @xmath84 where @xmath76 peaks ( see fig .  2 , bottom right panel ) ; there the slope reads @xmath85 after eq .",
    "thus the inner slopes are considerably _ flatter _ as to yield a smooth central pressure , while the outer one is _ steeper _ as to yield a definite overall mass , compared to the empirical nfw formula ( navarro et al .",
    "the latter , in fact , implies infinite mass , and angled central pressure and potential .",
    "the concentration parameter for the @xmath0-profiles is given in detail by @xmath86 in terms of the radius @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "this may be viewed as a measure of central condensation ( small @xmath87 ) and/or outskirts extension ( large @xmath28 ) .",
    "a significant observational test requires to go _ beyond _ the limitations to @xmath72 const and isotropy ; we tackle these issues in turn .      as to the latter , here we include on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 3 ) the anisotropy term .",
    "this clearly will _ steepen _ the density run for positive @xmath89 meaning radial dominance , as expected in the outskirts from infalling cold matter .",
    "tangential components must develop toward the center , as expected from increasing importance of angular momentum effects ( see lc09 ) , and as supported by numerical simulations ( austin et al . 2005 ; hansen & moore 2005 ; dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ) . in detail , the latter suggest the effective linear approximation @xmath90\\ ] ] with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , limited to @xmath93 .",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "2 ) the corresponding @xmath1 to be slightly _ flattened _ at the center by a weakly negative @xmath94 , and considerably _ steepened _ into the outskirts where @xmath95 grows substantially positive .",
    "specifically , the following simple rules apply : the slope @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is found to drop out from the derivatives of the jeans equation ( dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ) ; the upper bound to @xmath0 now reads @xmath97 ; @xmath98 is modified into @xmath99 while @xmath100 and @xmath101 retain their form .    as to the former and minor issue",
    ", we include the slowly decreasing run @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "1 ) enforced within outskirts developing by slow mass accretion , as the outer scale is stretched out while the body stays put .",
    "clearly , this affects little the inner profile of @xmath1 as jeans itself ( with its inner boundary conditions ) works from the inside out , but it tilts _ down _ @xmath1 appreciably into the outskirts .    in fig .  2",
    "we represent as solid lines the @xmath0-profiles _ refined _ as to include both the declining @xmath102 and the anisotropies discussed above .",
    "now we turn to testing these refined profiles against the recent , extensive gl observations of the cluster a1689 that join strong and weak lensing to cover scales from @xmath103 to @xmath104 mpc , the latter being the virial radius @xmath28 , see broadhurst et al .",

    "( 2006 ) , limousin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , umetsu & broadhurst ( 2008 ) ; we focus on the dataset presented by the latter authors and refined in lemze et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "these observations concern the surface density , for which our benchmark is constituted by the refined @xmath0-profiles integrated over the l.o.s . at a projected distance @xmath105 from the center @xmath106 in fig .",
    "3 we illustrate as blue lines the outcomes of fits to the data in terms of our refined @xmath0-profiles ; for the anisotropy we have adopted eq .",
    "( 5 ) , with @xmath94 as the only effective parameter , see   3.1 .",
    "the dashed line represents the best fit for isotropic profiles ( @xmath73 ) with the prior @xmath107 from the two - stage development ( see   2.1 ) ; the solid line refers to the best fit for anisotropic profiles subject to the priors @xmath107 and @xmath108 from simulations ( see   3.1 ) ; the dot - dashed line refers to the best fit for anisotropic profiles with no prior . for comparison ,",
    "the black dotted line illustrates the fit with the nfw formula .    in table 1",
    "we report the corresponding values of the fitting parameters @xmath0 , @xmath94 , and @xmath109 ( with their @xmath110 uncertainty ) , and of the corresponding minimum @xmath111 .",
    "the physical @xmath0-profiles generally provide fits of comparable or better quality than the empirical nfw formula ; note that an optimal fit obtains with no priors on @xmath0 and @xmath89 , but at the cost of ignoring the information on the former as provided by the two - stage development , and on the latter as provided by the numerical simulations .",
    "lcccc + nfw & @xmath112 & @xmath112 & @xmath113 & @xmath114 +   + @xmath107 , @xmath115 & @xmath116 & @xmath117 & @xmath118 & @xmath119 +   + @xmath107 , @xmath108 & @xmath120 & @xmath121 & @xmath122 & @xmath123 +   + no priors & @xmath124 & @xmath125 & @xmath126 & @xmath127 +    we find that _ balanced _ fits to the surface density in a1689 require @xmath8 ; lower values would cause wide overshooting of the outer points , while higher ones would allow approaching these ( with little impact on @xmath128 owing to the large uncertainties ) at the cost of overshooting the precise inner points .",
    "a similar balancing has been found by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2008 ) from fits with the empirical nfw formula , yielding generally high concentrations .",
    "these authors suggest that large values of @xmath109 may be understood in terms of formation redshifts earlier than expected from the standard @xmath9cdm cosmogony , as quantitatively focused by sadeh & rephaeli ( 2008 ) . from the perspective of our @xmath0-profiles ,",
    "concentrations @xmath129 are strictly related to transition redshifts @xmath130 based on the state - of - the - art evolution of biased @xmath9cdm halos , see eq .",
    "( 2 ) and fig .  1",
    "; on the same ground , we compute their occurrence to be bounded by about @xmath131 in blind sampling .",
    "on the other hand , such early biased halos tend to be favored with gl data .",
    "this is because strong gl observations are favored by centrally flat profiles and steep outskirts producing conspicuously large einstein rings ( broadhurst & barkana 2008 ) .",
    "meanwhile , weak gl observations require extensive outskirts to affect numerous background galaxies .    for a1689",
    "the latter data with their uncertainties are not yet sharply constraining the fit , but we expect convergence toward the physical profiles as the uncertainties are narrowed down by improved control over the redshift distribution of background galaxies ( see medezinski et al .",

    "2007 , umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "more and more clusters are being covered by gl observations , which often find evidence of centrally flat density runs ( brada et al .",

    "2008 , richard et al .",
    "2009 , oguri et al .",
    "2009 ) , consistently with our physical @xmath0-profiles .",
    "to sum up , the dm halo benchmark we test with gl observations is comprised of a time and a space behavior , that we strictly link in the framework of @xmath9cdm cosmogony . as to time",
    ", we find a _",
    "narrow _ range of the dm entropy slope @xmath0 as the outcome of a _ two - stage _ development comprising an early fast collapse of the body followed by a slow , inside - out growth of the outskirts .    as to space ,",
    "the physical @xmath0-profiles we derive feature density runs @xmath1 intrinsically _ flatter _ toward the center , and intrinsically _ steeper _ toward the outskirts as to yield a definite mass , relative to the singular nfw rendition of early @xmath4-body data .",
    "we find these runs to be stable with , or even _ sharpened _ by anisotropy .",
    "these physical @xmath0-profiles improve at both small and large scales the fits to the gl data , including the extensively probed case of a1689 . here",
    "the present analysis requires a halo _ biased _ toward a main progenitor lineage , with non - standard concentration @xmath8 marking a body collapsed early at @xmath57 and late extensive outskirts ; we find such halos to comprise some @xmath132 of the clusters .",
    "alternative proposals to relieve the tension of the gl observations with the profiles expected for average clusters include density cores flattened by degenerate pressure ( nakajima & morikawa 2007 ) , or concentrations enhanced by some @xmath133 owing to sharply prolate triaxialities ( see hennawi et al . 2007 ;",
    "oguri & blandford 2009 ; corless et al .",
    "2009 ) which on the other hand would produce steeper central slopes .",
    "the @xmath0-profiles and the two - stage development dispense with such contrasting interpretations , providing sharp and consistent shapes linked with early - biased histories .",
    "this view clearly invites blind sampling of more clusters in gl .    on the other hand , as we discuss below , x - ray data will provide an _ independent _ line of evidence concerning profiles and concentrations .",
    "this is based on the other major component of clusters , i.e. , the intracluster plasma ( icp ) which settles to its own equilibrium within the dm potential well , and emits strong x rays by thermal bremsstrahlung ( see sarazin 1988 ) .    icp information from spectroscopy ( yielding the temperature @xmath134 ) and x - ray brightness ( yielding the squared number density @xmath135 ) are best combined in the form of the thermodynamic icp entropy ( adiabat ) @xmath136 ; this modulates the icp equilibrium within the dm potential well , and throughout the cluster body follows a powerlaw run @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "in fact , lapi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and cavaliere et al .",
    "( 2009 ) compute the slope @xmath139 to be expected in the cluster outskirts from accretion of external gas shocked at about the virial @xmath28 ( see also tozzi & norman 2001 ) .",

    "values @xmath144 are seen to apply for @xmath0-profiles with concentration @xmath145 , to yield @xmath146 and @xmath147 as measured in many clusters .",
    "but in clusters with extensive outskirts and higher concentrations the outer potential is shallower and @xmath148 smaller ; when @xmath8 one finds @xmath149 , yielding an intrinsically _ flatter _",
    "@xmath150 ( and a steeper @xmath151 in the absence of large central energy discharges ) .",
    "this theoretical expectation finds gratifying support in the flat @xmath152 observed in a1689 by lemze et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath0-profiles provide a physical _ benchmark _ also useful in the context of probing cold dm annihilations [ @xmath153 or decays [ @xmath154 through diffuse @xmath71-ray emissions expected from the galaxy center ( e.g. , bertone et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the positron excess recently detected by _ pamela _ ( e.g. , adriani et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we will investigate the issue elsewhere .    finally ,",
    "since a two - stage development also applies to hot dm cosmogonies ( though with @xmath109 decreasing in cosmic time , see wang & white 2008 ) , we comment upon the case for cold dm on the basis of the radial run @xmath155 .",
    "we expect that _ cold _ dm halos will be marked by @xmath2 falling down to a few hundreds km s@xmath22 into the outskirts , cf .",
