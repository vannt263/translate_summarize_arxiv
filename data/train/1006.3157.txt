    "@xcite the identification of these charge excitations seems more complicated . indeed , while in the past measurements of current noise through quantum point contacts ( qpc ) , in the weak backscattering regime , confirmed the tunneling of single - qp@xcite , recently , new measurements have demonstrated the possibility of tunneling charges multiple of the fundamental charge .",
    "the condition to observe a bunching of qp depends on the external parameters such as temperature and voltage .",
    "measurements@xcite carried out for the jain series ( @xmath6 ) , at extremely low temperatures , show an effective charge equal to @xmath7 , which , only by increasing the temperature , decreases to the fundamental value @xmath8 .",
    "last year , experimental results for filling factor @xmath1 @xmath9 appeared @xcite , showing a similar crossover .",
    "this common trend was very recently verified also for filling factor outside the jain series belonging to fractional values in the second landau level @xcite .",
    "in addition to the bunching phenomena peculiar behavior also appears in the backscattering current at high transparencies .",
    "for example for @xmath10 , the current was found to increase with temperature @xcite instead of decrease as theoretically predicted @xcite .",
    "this support the indication of a non - universal renormalization of the tunneling exponents induced by the presence of edge interaction with external environment @xcite , electron - electron interaction @xcite and edge reconstruction @xcite .    in order to describe the jain sequence",

    "the dependence of the excess noise on the external parameters such as the voltage and the temperature is quantitatively analyzed .",
    "the flexibility of the proposed model resides on the possibility to link the results obtained in the presence of counter - propagating or co - propagating neutral modes .",
    "we demonstrate that both cases reproduce the experimental results using a proper choice of the fitting parameters .",
    "we also propose the skewness , namely the normalized third backscattering current cumulant , as a measurable quantity @xcite able to give independent information on the nature of the carriers .",
