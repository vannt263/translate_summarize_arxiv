    "the jahn - teller effect ( jte ) is one of the most important phenomena caused by electron - vibrational interaction , which has broad impact on both physics and chemistry . in fundamental physics",
    ", jte relates to the symmetry - breaking concept , where the system hamiltonian has a certain symmetry , but the ground state does not . in chemistry and condensed matter physics , the jte is essential in understanding the structure , the optical and magnetic properties of polyatomic systems like molecules and solid state point defects .",

    "the dynamic jte is usually measured by the change of optical or magnetic resonance properties under different conditions ( e.g. , temperature and strain ) .",
    "the characteristic parameters of the jte , including the the potential barrier height and the tunneling rate , are usually inferred indirectly from the ensemble averaged quantities such as optical and magnetic transition frequencies and line widths . directly monitoring the quantum jumps of individual systems in real - time ( e.g. , a single molecule or a single solid - state defect )",
    "is intriguing and will provide more knowledges about the dynamic jte and the local environment .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the real - time measurement of dynamic jte of an individual system is not achieved because of the weak signal associated with a single molecule or a single defect .    in this work",

    "the p1 centers with different orientations can have different magnetic resonance frequencies in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
