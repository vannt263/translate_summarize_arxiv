    "single component and collisionless cold dark matter ( ccdm ) , which is treated as the standard dark matter ( dm ) candidate in @xmath2 model , accounts for the cosmological data from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and the large scale structure .",
    "however , the above dm properties lead to some controversies between the n - body simulation and astrophysical observations on small scale structures with non - linear dm - dominated systems .",
    "a cusp structure is formed by gravitationally attracting a large number of dm in the center regions of galaxies and the zero dissipative dynamics  @xcite . on the other hand , observations indicate that dm distributes in a much more flat profile in the center regions  @xcite .",
    "this is called the cusp / core problem  @xcite .",
    "there exists other problem with ccdm concerning the size of subhalos , which are the hosts of the satellite galaxies surrounding the milky way ( mw ) halo .",
    "the dispersion velocities from these galaxy rotation curves reflect the size of their host subhalos .",
    "it is observed that a discrepancy in the subhalo size exists between the ccdm - only simulation and the observations  @xcite . about @xmath3(10 ) most massive subhalos generated from the n - body simulation are too massive in the mw halo ( with circular velocity larger than 30 km / s ) whereas the maximum circular velocities of mw dwarf spheroidals are less than 25 km / s .",
    "this is referred to the `` too - big - to - fail '' problem indicating no satellite galaxy hosted by such massive subhalo is found .",
    "it is possible that these puzzles may be due to insufficient knowledge of the baryonic processes such as the supernova feedback and photonization  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", these conflicts may also hint nontrivial features of dm such as self - interacting dm ( sidm )  @xcite .",
    "it was then noted that the sidm with a constant cross section can not account for observed ellipticities in clusters  @xcite and the survivability of subhalos  @xcite . in",
    "the very short mean free path limit , it produces even more cuspy profiles  @xcite .",
    "however , some recent simulations have shown that the sidm velocity - independent cross sections in the range @xmath4  @xmath5 ( @xmath1 denoting the dm mass ) can resolve the cusp / core and too - big - to - fail problems on dwarf scales  @xcite , although it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath6  @xmath5 is too small to account for the population of massive subhalos , and the study using bullet cluster 1e 0657 - 56 constrains @xmath7 to be less than 1.25  @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other investigations of sidm with characteristic velocity - dependent cross sections provide a broader cross section range , @xmath8  @xmath5 , for alleviating the above - mentioned puzzles  @xcite . from particle physics point of view , dm exchanging light mediators would generate an attractive self - interaction , which enhances the annihilation cross section by sommerfield effect and resonance scattering  @xcite .",
    "the mediator @xmath9 often plays as the messenger between the visible matter and dark matter .",
    "this mediator can be scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , or axial - vector particles  @xcite .",
    "the scalar and vector interactions with nucleon only generate spin - independent ( si ) cross section ( in the non - relativistic limit ) , while spin - dependent cross section can be generated via exchanging pseudoscalar or axial - vector particles .",
    "the relatively large sidm cross section requires a mev scale @xmath9 satisfying  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dark fine structure constant representing the coupling strength between dm @xmath12 and the mediator @xmath9 . with @xmath13 around the mev scale ,",
    "it is possible for @xmath9 to decay into light standard model particles .",
    "in such a case , the lifetime of @xmath9 should be less than 1 sec to satisfy the bbn constraint .",
    "therefore , the light mediator @xmath9 can produce both direct and indirect dm signatures .",
    "the former signature is generated when dm scatters with the nuclei by exchanging @xmath9 .",
    "the latter signature is generated by the annihilation of dms into a pair of @xmath9 , which subsequently decay into sm particles .",
    "the mediator @xmath9 can be a hidden @xmath0 gauge boson or scalar , which mixes with photon , @xmath14 boson or higgs boson to bridge between dm and the visible sectors .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig_xx ] ) is valid only at the perturbative regime ( @xmath15 ) , while the effects of dark force on the halo structure for the full range of parameters were investigated in ref .",
    "the characteristic velocity - dependent cross section at different scales for resolving all the conflicts can be realized .",
    "furthermore , dm direct detection experiments for probing such sidm scenarios were proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite  ( see also , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for the asymmetric dm scenario ) .",
    "the predicted direct detection cross section is within the reach of next - generation experiments such as xenon1 t  @xcite and supercdms  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider symmetric fermionic dm and show that the annihilation signatures from the trapped dms inside the sun can provide a complementary test to sidm scenarios .",
    "it is well known that the dm - nucleon scattering cross section relevant to the indirect dm signature from the sun is identical to the cross section relevant to dm direct detection experiments . for the former case",
    ", such a cross section leads to the dm capture if the velocity of the final - state dm is less than the escape velocity of the sun . as the number of captured dms increases to a significant level",
    ", the rate of dm annihilations into sm particles could become detectable  @xcite .",
    "the total number of the captured dms is determined by the above dm - nucleon scattering cross section and the dm mass .",
    "however , it has been shown in a model - independent approach that the dm accumulation time can be shortened in the sun and the total number of trapped dm can also be increased if sidm is considered  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the constraint @xmath16@xmath17 is obtained for the @xmath18 annihilation mode using icecube 79 string data  @xcite which probes the mass range @xmath19 20 gev .",
    "the low - mass dm region to be probed by icecube - pingu is considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we shall present a realization of the above model - independent results with a concrete sidm model .",
    "we work out the sidm model prediction on the dm - induced neutrino flux from the sun and the sensitivities of future neutrino telescopes to such a signal and the related model parameters .",
    "we compare these sensitivities to constraints set by current direct detection experiments .",
    "we will show that the searches for direct and indirect dm signals give complementary tests to the parameter space of sidm model .",
    "the complementarity of direct and indirect searches arises from two reasons .",
    "first , the indirect search can look for very light dm which is not yet probed by direct detections .",
    "second , the direct detection sensitivity could be significantly worsen by isospin violation in dm - nucleon couplings . on the other hand ,",
    "the dm - induced neutrino flux from the sun can be insensitive to dm - nucleus scattering cross section so long as dm self - interaction is strong enough  @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly introduce the sidm models where the light mediator is either a gauge boson or a scalar particle .",
    "the constraints on these models are summarized .",
    "section iii shows that the dm accumulation inside the sun can be significantly enhanced by dm self - interaction . in section iv",
    ", we demonstrate that icecube / pingu experiment can probe sidm parameters in a way complementary to the direct detection experiment .",
    "we present our conclusions in section v.",
    "two simplest ways to construct the sidm model with the feature of sommerfield enhancement are to assume a light vector boson or a light scalar boson as the dark force mediator . for the vector mediator case ,",
    "dm carries a charge @xmath20 under a hidden abelian @xmath21 gauge symmetry and @xmath22 is the corresponding gauge boson .",
    "the hidden @xmath21 gauge boson has no ordinary sm interaction except the one induced by kinetic mixing with the sm photon  @xcite .",
    "since we expect the mass of dark mediator @xmath9 to be around mev scale , there must exist certain mechanism to generate a massive @xmath21 gauge boson .",
    "it can be certain spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern in the dark sector or based upon the stueckelberg mechanism  @xcite to ensure the uv completion of the theory .",
    "here we take the phenomenological approach and neglect the details of model construction .",

    "the simplest scenario is that @xmath9 is a real singlet scalar .",
    "the relevant terms of the lagrangian are then given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are coupling constants and @xmath40 is the sm higgs doublet .",

    "we can define the mixing parameter @xmath42 , thus the effective lagrangian for the coupling of scalar @xmath9 to the sm fermions is given by @xmath43      the feynman diagrams for scattering among two dirac fermionic ( anti- ) dms via the dark mediator @xmath9 are depicted in fig .",

    "the difference in @xmath84 between @xmath122 and @xmath143 can be understood by the following arguments .",

    "hence @xmath84 with @xmath122 is greater than @xmath84 with @xmath143 no matter how large @xmath93 is .",
    "however , as @xmath1 increases , @xmath93 becomes more and more dominant over @xmath92 since @xmath54 in @xmath92 grows as @xmath160 while @xmath94 in @xmath92 grows as @xmath1 ( this follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sig_x - barx ] ) and ( [ eq : sig_xa ] ) and the fact that @xmath11 grows as @xmath1 ) .",
    "hence the reduction of @xmath92 by @xmath143 does not produce significant effect on @xmath84 , given a very dominant @xmath93 .",
    "this explains why @xmath84 is less sensitive to @xmath142 for larger @xmath1 .",
    "comparing upper right panel with the upper left one , we find @xmath84 is less sensitive to @xmath142 in the former case for the same @xmath1 .",
    "the dm - nucleus cross section @xmath94 for the upper right panel is suppressed due to a smaller @xmath32 .",
    "hence the effect from @xmath142 becomes less significant . for lower",
    "left and lower right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : n_chi ] , we take @xmath156 . in this case , both @xmath94 and @xmath54 are suppressed .",
    "hence the number of captured dm is much less and the equilibrium time scale is much larger .",
    "neutrino signals arise from the decays of @xmath9 which is produced by dm annihilation , i.e. , @xmath161 .",
    "dm annihilate to @xmath162 and @xmath163 modes are suppressed by small couplings between @xmath12-z and @xmath12-@xmath164 respectively . for the hidden @xmath0 gauge model considered in this paper , @xmath9 decays into sm particles via @xmath32 and @xmath33 mixings . due to the kinematics constraint ,",
    "@xmath165 and neutrinos are the only decay products of @xmath9 and the corresponding decay widths through photon and @xmath14 mixings are given in ref .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath166 is determined by the relative magnitudes of mixing parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the decay point is already outside the sun but not yet reaching to the earth .",
    "given the distance between the sun and the earth at @xmath178 km , those @xmath9 with @xmath173 mev of mass and moving toward the earth shall decay between sun and earth provided @xmath179 is less than @xmath180 gev .",

    ", the neutrino propagating distance from source to terrestrial detector becomes larger .",
    "however this does not affect the oscillation of neutrinos because neutrino propagating distances in both cases are much larger than the neutrino oscillation length .",
    "hence our results on neutrino event rates are not affected .",
    "the argument in the last paragraph assumes @xmath9 propagating freely inside the sun . to justify this assumption , we study the interaction between @xmath9 and hydrogen , which occurs through the mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath164 and the subsequent @xmath183 scattering .",
    "the total @xmath183 scattering cross section at @xmath184 gev is about @xmath185 mb  @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath134 , we have @xmath186 total cross section as small as @xmath187 @xmath113 . with the average hydrogen number density in the sun about @xmath188/@xmath189 ,",

    "we note that the consideration of other chemical elements in the sun should shorten the mean free path of @xmath9 slightly .",
    "nonetheless , this distance scale remains much greater than the radius of the sun .",
    "since each @xmath9 stays at the same direction before its decay , one can view those neutrinos produced by @xmath9 decays as being originated from the core of the sun .",
    "hence we can write the neutrino flux as @xmath190 with @xmath191 the neutrino oscillation during the propagation , @xmath192 the dm annihilation rate , @xmath193 the distance between sun and earth , and @xmath194 the neutrino spectrum from each annihilation",

    "<S> the halo dark matter ( dm ) can be captured by the sun if its final velocity after the collision with a nucleus in the sun is less than the escape velocity . for self - interacting dm ( sidm ) , we show that the number of dm trapped inside the sun still provides significant signals even if the dm - nucleon cross section is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a sidm model where @xmath0 gauge symmetry is introduced to account for the dm self - interaction . </S>",
    "<S> such a model naturally leads to isospin violating dm - nucleon interaction , although isospin symmetric interaction is still allowed as a special case . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the detection of neutrino signature from dm annihilation in the sun can probe those sidm parameter ranges not reachable by direct the detection . </S>",
    "<S> those parameter ranges are either the region with a very small @xmath1 or the region opened up due to isospin violations . </S>"
