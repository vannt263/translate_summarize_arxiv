    "the crumpling transition of membranes is an interesting topic in the softmatter physics as well as in the biological physics @xcite .",
    "a well - known model for such transition is the surface model of helfrich , polyakov , and kleinert @xcite .",
    "a considerable number of theoretical and numerical studies have been devoted to reveal the phase structure of the model @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations that the model undergoes a first - order transition on spherical and fixed connectivity surfaces @xcite , and the transition is universal @xcite .",
    "the vertices can move only locally on the surface because of the fixed connectivity nature in those surface models .",
    "however , the crumpling transition is not yet clearly understood in biological membranes .",
    "if we consider the possibility of the transition in the cell membranes , we should take account of the fluid nature such as the lateral diffusion of lipids .    conventionally , the free diffusion of lipids has been realized by the dynamical triangulation technique in the surface model@xcite .",
    "the diffusion of lipids corresponds to the reparametrization invariance of the model , because the diffusion has no cost in energy on fluid surfaces .    in the cell membranes ,",
    "however , the free diffusion of lipids is suffered from heterogeneous structures .",
    "lipid molecules of the cell membranes are known to undergo the so - called hop diffusion over the surface , which was recently found experimentally @xcite .",
    "the free diffusion of lipids is prohibited due to the cytoskeleton .",
    "the diffusion rate is , therefore , 10 - 100 times lower than that of artificial membranes , which is usually homogeneous and has no such domain structure .",
    "moreover , some artificial membranes are considered to have skeletons , because they are partly polymerized @xcite .",
    "motivated by this fact observed in the cell membranes , we study in this letter a dynamically triangulated surface model with compartmentalized domains whose boundaries are consisting of triangle edges ( or bonds ) that are not to be flipped .",
    "the diffusion is constrained so that vertices can diffuse only inside each domain , and hence the vertices never jump across from one domain to the other domains .",
    "nevertheless , we consider that such constrained lateral diffusion can simulate the hop diffusion in the cell membranes as a first approximation .",
    "by dividing every edge of the icosahedron into @xmath0-pieces of the uniform length , we have a triangulated surface of size @xmath1 (= the total number of vertices ) .",
    "the starting configurations are thus characterized by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total number of vertices with the co - ordination number @xmath5 .",
    "the compartmentalized structure is built on the surface by keeping the boundary bonds unflipped in the mc simulations with dynamical triangulation .",
    "the boundary of the compartment is constructed from a sequence of bonds that remain unflipped .",
    "the total number @xmath6 of the compartments depends on the surface size @xmath7 .",
    "we fix @xmath8 the total number of vertices inside a compartment to the following three values : @xmath9 as a consequence , @xmath6 is increased with the increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the reason why we fix @xmath8 is that the size of compartment is considered to be finite , and then it is expected that total number of lipids in the compartment also remains finite in the cell membranes .",
    "we must emphasize that the finiteness of @xmath8 is physically meaningful rather than the value of @xmath8 , because we do not always have one to one correspondence between the vertices and the lipid molecules .",
    "figures [ fig-1](a),(b ) show surfaces of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the starting configurations of mc simulations .",
    "thick lines denote the compartment boundary consisting of the bonds that are not to be flipped .",

    "thus we confirmed that the smooth phase can be seen close to the transition point at finite @xmath15 in contrast to the case @xmath13 , where it can be seen only at @xmath94 .",
    "to the summary , we have studied a compartmentalized surface model for the cell membranes and found that the model undergoes a first - order transition between the smooth phase and the crumpled phase .",
    "the model is classified as a fluid surface model , although the long - range order and the phase transition can be seen at finite @xmath15 .",
    "the compartmentalized structure is an origin of a broken symmetry for the reparametrizaition invariance , which is considered to be a reason for the existence of the phase transition .",
    "consequently , the result is not in contradiction with the standard argument for the non - existence of long - range order in fluid membranes .",
    "moreover , the critical point of the transition is strongly expected at finite @xmath95 . the number @xmath67 and the corresponding critical bending rigidity @xmath96 remained to be clarified .",
    "however , it is possible that the compartmentalized fluid surface model undergoes a continuous transition , because the strength of the transition is expected to be continuously softened with the increasing @xmath8 .",
    "we observed that the phase transition remains first - order at @xmath53 and disappear at @xmath13 in the limit of @xmath97 .",
    "although the demonstration of the continuous transition is computationally a hard task , it will be performed and the results including those in this letter will be reported elsewhere .",
