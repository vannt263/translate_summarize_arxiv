    "the relative distribution of stellar masses in a given generation ( the so - called initial mass function or imf ) is a fundamental entity linking the micro - physics of molecular cloud fragmentation with the global characteristics of galactic stellar populations .",
    "the imf regulates the proportion of high to low mass stars , and hence , the study of diagnostics such as abundance ratios can constrain its main features , i.e. its normalisation , upper and lower ends and shape . the integrated galactic initial mass function",
    "( igimf ) theory ( kroupa & weidner 2003 ; weidner & kroupa 2005 ) is aimed at providing a self - consistent description of how the imf varies as a function of another fundamental characteristic in galaxy evolution models , namely the star formation ( sf ) history .",
    "the igimf is based on the fundamental assumptions that ( @xmath1 ) most stars form in small stellar groups , i.e. in embedded clusters . within each cluster ,",
    "the stars are distributed according to a universal two - slope power law imf : @xmath2 below 0.5 m@xmath3 and @xmath4 above 0.5 m@xmath3 .",
    "the maximum stellar mass in an individual cluster is a function of the cluster mass ; ( @xmath5 ) the stellar clusters are distributed according to a single - slope power law and ( @xmath6 ) the maximum possible mass of a star cluster increases with the galactic sf rate .",
    "the main implication is that low mass galaxies , characterised by low sf values , present a steeper ( top - light ) imf than the milky way .    in two previous papers ,",
    "the igimf theory has been applied to study the abundance ratios in different classes of galaxies .",
    "recchi et al . ( 2009 , hereafter r09 ) investigated the integrated abundances in local early type galaxies , showing with a chemical evolution model that the igimf theory , coupled with their downsizing character ( i.e. the fact that the sf timescale inversely correlates with the mass of the system ) well accounts for the observed correlation between integrated [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios and mass , or velocity dispersion @xmath7 , of the galaxy .",
    "in particular , these models predict a change in the [ @xmath0/fe ] vs. @xmath7 relation not achievable with a constant imf .",
    "calura et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter c10 ) applied the igimf to a model for the solar neighbourhood , showing that a large set of observables can be accounted for and suggesting how the present - day mass function can be used locally in order to disentangle between different imf scenarios .",
    "in all these studies , the determination of the imf parameters required the assumption of a sf history , which is unknown a priori and which renders the problem degenerate .",
    "in fact , it is well known from chemical evolution studies that a higher sf efficiency mimics the effects of a imf skewed towards massive stars ( see e.g. matteucci 1994 ) .",
    "a different diagnostic able to provide crucial information on the imf is the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau observed at low metallicity in the galactic halo ( clegg et al .",
    "1981 ; barbuy 1988 ; edvardsson et al .",
    "the importance of the low metallicity plateau is that it depends solely on the imf ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , in the sense that the plateau s value is set entirely by the imf slope ( and massive star yields ) , irrespective of the uncertain role played by type ia supernovae",
    ".    the situation is different within the igimf theory , in that the plateau depends on the sf history .",
    "if it is possible to establish the existence of a [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau of metal - poor stars in different galaxies , its value will depend on the igimf slope and on the upper mass limit , hence it will be a function of the sf history of that system .",
    "on the other hand , with a constant , sf - independent imf , all the galaxies will have the same [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau , irrespective of the sf history .    to make the previous reasoning more quantitative ,",
    "let us assume that all the stars with masses larger than 8 m@xmath3 explode as type ii sne .",
    "it is possible to establish an average [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath8 of the interstellar medium in the halo as a consequence of snii pollution ( hence of the halo stars ) through the formula : @xmath9_h}=\\frac{\\int_{8}^{m_{up}}m_\\alpha^{ej } \\varphi(m)dm}{\\int_{8}^{m_{up}}m_{fe}^{ej } \\varphi(m)dm},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the adopted imf , @xmath11 is its upper limit and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the theoretical yields from type ii sne ( see tsujimoto et al .",
    "1997 ; gibson 1998 ) .",
    "once a compilation of snii yields is established ( for instance the widely used woosley & weaver 1995 compilation ) , the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau is determined solely by the imf , in particular by its slope at the high - mass range and upper limit .",
    "tsujimoto et al . ( 1997 ) showed in this way that the [ o / fe ] in galactic metal - poor halo stars is consistent with an imf with slope 2.32.6 above 1 m@xmath3 ( i.e. similar or slightly larger than the salpeter index ) and an upper mass limit @xmath14 m@xmath3 .",
    "although gibson ( 1998 ) pointed out all the limits and weaknesses of this approach , nevertheless a point should be made .",
    "if an [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau of metal - poor stars in different galaxies is established , its value can only reflect the imf slope(s ) and upper mass limit .",
    "the yields of massive stars , although still very uncertain , can not change from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "if the imf is the same in all galaxies , the most metal - poor stars must have on average the same [ @xmath0/fe ] , irrespective of the galaxy they belong to .",
    "if instead a variation of the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau among different galaxies is established , this is a clear indication that the imf is not universal .",
    "this provides a potentially interesting test for the igimf theory because the latter predicts that dwarf galaxies , characterised by average mild - low sf rates ( sfrs ) , should have steeper imfs ( and lower values of @xmath11 ) than the milky way ( weidner & kroupa 2005 ) . at variance with the previously published works of r09 and c10 , this test for the igimf",
    "is independent of the weakly constrained role of type ia sne and low- and intermediate - mass stellar yields on the abundance patterns .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the imf variations we are dealing with here are concentrated in the upper range of stellar masses .",
    "the igimf theory predicts little changes in the imf for stars with low and intermediate masses , whereas the change of the imf slope for high - mass stars and of the upper mass cut off can be extremely significant ( see e.g. fig . 1 of r09 or fig .",
    "[ igimf ] in this paper ) .",
    "the change of the imf in this mass range can directly and significantly affect the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus .",
    "other forms of imf variations among galaxies has been inferred / deduced recently . on the one hand , it seems that also the low - mass end of the imf changes according to the galaxy mass ( conroy & van dokkum 2012 ; ferreras et al .",
    "on the other hand , also the metallicity can have a significant role in the star formation process , regulating the transition between popiii and popii stars , whose imfs are supposed to be very different ( see e.g. bromm et al . 2001 ; schneider et al . 2002 .",

    "the main assumption of the igimf theory is that all the stars in a galaxy form in star clusters .",
    "these star clusters need not be gravitationally bound entities , but should be seen as space - time correlated stellar populations , deeply embedded in gas .",
    "these embedded clusters have , prior to the removal of their remaining gas , radii of about 0.15 pc , in agreement with molecular cloud cores and the filamentary structures of molecular clouds ( andr et al .",

    "the upper mass @xmath22 is a function of the mass of the embedded cluster @xmath23 ; this is simply due to the fact that small clusters do not have enough mass to produce very massive stars .    on the other hand ,",
    "the mass distribution function of the correlated star formation entities ( embedded clusters ) is assumed to be a single - slope power law , @xmath24 , with a slope @xmath25 close to 2 ( zhang & fall 1999 ; lada & lada 2003 ) . in this work , as in our previous igimf studies , we have considered values of @xmath25 : 1.00 , 2.00 and 2.35 . according to the quoted papers and to the results of r09 and",
    "c10 the reference value for @xmath25 will be 2 , but it is of interest to evaluate the dependence of our results on the choice of @xmath25 .",
    "the combination of the stellar imf with the mass distribution of embedded clusters yields the igimf , i.e. the imf integrated over the whole population of embedded clusters forming in a galaxy as a function of the star formation rate @xmath26 :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the minimum and maximum possible masses of the embedded clusters in a population of clusters , respectively , and @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath28 we assume the value of 5 m@xmath3 , i.e. the mass of a taurus - auriga aggregate , which is arguably the smallest star - forming `` cluster '' known . on the other hand , the upper mass of the embedded cluster population depends on the sfr ; this fact renders the whole igimf dependent on @xmath31 .",
    "the existence of a correlation between @xmath32 and sfr has been observationally established ( larsen & richtler 2000 ; weidner et al .",
    "2004 ) and originates from the sampling of clusters from the embedded cluster mass function given the amount of gas mass being turned into stars per unit time ( weidner et al .",
    "in accordance with weidner et al .",

    "[ igimf ] , we show the igimf as a function of the sfr for the three values of @xmath25 considered in this work , compared to a single - slope , salpeter imf .",
    "the igimfs are characterised by a nearly uniform decline , nearly approximated by a power law , and a sharp cutoff at mass values close to @xmath22 .",
    "the steepest distribution of embedded cluster ( in our case the model with @xmath36 ) produces also the steepest igimf ; this occurs since this distribution is biased towards embedded clusters of low mass , therefore the probability of finding high mass stars in this cluster population is lower .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the igimf on the sfr is strong for sfr @xmath37 1 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 whereas it is weak for sfr @xmath39 1 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 ( see r09 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that for sfrs larger than @xmath40 1 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 , the maximum possible value of the embedded cluster mass is very high , therefore it is always possible to sample massive stars in a galaxy up to a mass very close to the empirical limit ( which is assumed to be @xmath41 150 m@xmath3 ; see weidner & kroupa 2005 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that here the imf within each embedded cluster is assumed to always be invariant .",
    "that is , neither the possibly of having a top - heavy imf in star - burst clusters ( which leads to a top - heavy igimf for sfr @xmath42 10 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 ; see weidner et al .",

    "it is important to stress that the results of m12 are mostly based on studies of the mass distribution in globular clusters , therefore it is not clear whether they can be directly applied to galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that it is interesting to study the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in the framework of this new igimf formulation also because it is the first time to our knowledge that the chemical composition and evolution of a galaxy having a metallicity - dependent igimf has been studied .",
    "m12 consider indeed the combined effect of cluster densities and metallicities .",
    "since we have no information on the densities of our model galaxies , we will consider only the results of m12 concerning the metallicity dependence of the imf .",

    "this formula ensures that a galaxy like the milky way has a present time high - mass imf slope of 2.3 , in agreement with the assumptions of m12 , and very similar to the high mass imf slope of 2.35 adopted by r09 .",
    "it is important to stress that we modify the imf _ within each star cluster _ according to this formula .",
    "once a distribution function of star clusters has been assumed , the integrated imf is then calculated by integrating the imf of the various star clusters , according to the standard recipes ( see sect . [",

    "( 2007 ) found indeed a dependence of the imf slope on the metallicity of the parent galaxy .",
    "galaxies at higher metallicities were found to have steeper imfs , with the slope index ranging from @xmath40 1.00 for the lowest metallicity , to @xmath40 3.30 for the highest metallicity .",
    "such direct determinations of the imf slopes in galaxies are extremely useful to understand how the imf is related to the galactic metal content and to assess the validity of the metallicity - dependent igimf put forward by m12 .     as fig .",
    "[ fig : comp1 ] but for the hard dependence of the igimf on metallicity ( eqs .",

    "according to the hard model , the metallicity effect prevails .",
    "consequently , at the time of observation , the imf in high - sfr , high - metallicity galaxies is steeper than the corresponding imf in smaller galaxies .",
    "of course , also the halo of the mw has experienced phases of its evolution characterised by very low metallicities , during which the imf was flat . to keep track of this time evolution of the imf",

    "the sfr was relatively high . that allowed the [ fe / h ] to reach a value of -1 , without significant contribution from type ia sne .",
    "in the framework of the metallicity - dependent igimf , we thus assume that the stars in the mw halo stem from stellar populations having different metallicities , up to [ fe / h]=-1 . in the most metal - poor stellar populations",
    "the imf is flat but it steepens as the metallicity increases .",
    "plateau stars are stars for which the contribution from type ia sne is still negligible .",

    "[ sec : resgal ] , at this level of sf the predicted [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus are very close to the ones observed in the mw .",
    "such a sfr would make our computation of [ mg / fe ] fully compatible with the observed plateaus in sextans , carina and draco ( see again fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "large differences are predicted if the sfr is significantly below 10@xmath60 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 .",
    "we have reported in table [ table4 ] the ranges of acceptable sfrs for each galaxy , according to the comparison between ( z - independent ) igimf model results and observations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] .",
    "we can see that carina , sextans and sculptor can have had early sfrs as low as 0.1 m@xmath3 y@xmath38 or less , whereas draco is the only considered dgs requiring larger sfrs ( at least 0.3 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 ) .",
    "also fornax , with a [ mg / fe ] plateau of @xmath40 0.1 dex ( see sect . [",
    "sec : afe_obs ] ) , is compatible with an early sfr of @xmath40 0.04 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 .",
    "these sfrs are in general larger than the ones found in the literature for dgss and summarised above .",
    "we remark again that , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , the [ mg / fe ] ratios of the most metal - poor stars in dgss could be compatible also with a very low sfr ( less than 10@xmath58 m@xmath3 y@xmath38 ) .",
    "however , we believe that this solution is unlikely because , in this interval of sfrs , the average [ mg / fe ] ratios vary strongly . the average [ mg / fe ] ratios in the four considered dgss are however quite similar ( table [ table4 ] ) and this fact seems to be hard to reconcile with the derived strong dependence of [ mg / fe ] with sfr .",
    "the sfrs suggested by the models ( table [ table4 ] ) and the ones available from the literature seem thus to be different .",
    "the reasons for this mismatch could be :    * as we have already argued , the determinations of the sfr in dgss based on synthetic cmds do not correctly take into account the stars lost during the dgs orbit around the milky way and , thus , under - estimate the intrinsic early sfr . * the imfs in galaxies",
    "are indeed metallicity - dependent .",
    "as we have shown , both mild and hard models predict [ mg / fe ] plateaus that are closer to the observations than what predicted by the z - independent igimf model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mgfe_zdep ] ) .",
    "* at variance with our assumptions , the imf in galaxies is indeed universal and , therefore , the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus of galaxies must always be the same ( see also kirby et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "based on the presently known observational facts , none of these three possibilities can be definitely ruled out . as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : resgal ] , available observations for draco , carina , sextans and sculptor suggest that the most metal - poor stars in these dgss have apparently slightly lower average [ mg / fe ] ratios than the most metal - poor milky way stars .",
    "this is an indication that the imf can indeed be non - universal .",
    "however , once again one should not forget that other high - quality data in other dgss ( frebel et al .",
    "2010 , norris et al .",
    "2010 , simon et al .",
    "2010 , vargas et al .",
    "2013 ) indicate the presence of very metal - poor stars with [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios equal or even larger that the cayrel plateau .",
    "clearly , these data also demand a theoretical explanation .",
    "we can at the present not even exclude the possibility that [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of the most metal - poor stars in some ( or most of ) dgss of the milky way are larger than the mw plateau value . in this case ,",
    "our results could be compatible with the observations only if we consider the `` hard '' z - dependent imf model ( see again fig . 8) .",
    "again , our results should be seen as predictions and , once data concerning sfrs and [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus in dwarf galaxies will be more reliable , we will be able to establish more precisely if and to what extent metallicity affects the slopes of the imf in galaxies .",
    "another hypothesis could be considered here . some authors ( see kroupa 2012 , kroupa et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) find that dgss can not be of cosmological origin .",
    "at least a fraction of them can be originated by the tidal disruption of a much larger galaxy ( see also lynden - bell 1976 ) . a key probe of that is the alignment of most of the dgss along a disk ( the _ disk of satellites _ ) , almost perpendicular to the mw disk .",
    "another spectacular example of disk of satellites has been recently discovered around andromeda ( ibata et al .",
    "if this is the case , of course the abundance patterns of the metal - poor stars in these galaxies reflect the early conditions of this large , disrupted galaxy .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus in the fragments that emerge after the disruption of the parent galaxy should be determined by the sfr in the early evolution of this primordial galaxy .",
    "they should therefore be quite similar to the mw plateau , without big differences from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "of course , better measurements of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in dgss and larger samples can shed light on this scenario , too .",
    "in this work we have studied the dependence of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in the most metal - poor stars of a galaxy ( the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus ) on the galaxy s initial mass distribution of stars .",
    "the working hypothesis we have assumed in this study is that the most metal - poor stars in a galaxy are made out of gas that has been solely polluted by type ii sne .",
    "ejecta from intermediate - mass stars and from type ia sne are released on longer timescales and can not contribute to the chemical enrichment at this early stage . in this way we can establish a connection between the high mass slope of the imf and the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau .",
    "if the high mass imf slope is universal , than the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau can not change from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "if instead different galaxies are characterised by different imf slopes , then a correlation between [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau and imf could be theoretically established .",
    "in particular , the igimf theory ( kroupa & weidner 2003 ) predicts a steep imf in dwarf galaxies , characterised by mild sfrs .",
    "one could thus test the igimf theory by calculating the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus as a function of the average sfr in a galaxy and compare them with available observations in the best observed sample of dwarf galaxies , namely the satellites of the milky way .",
    "however , as summarised in sect .",
    "[ sec : afe_obs ] , neither the early sf histories nor the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau values can be firmly established for most of the mw dgss .",
    "our results should be seen as predictions of the igimf models , to be compared with observations only once the determinations of these quantities will be more reliable .    moreover , recent works ( kroupa et al .",
    "2013 ; m12 ) suggest that the imf in star clusters ( hence also the integrated galactic imf ) could depend on the star cluster s metallicity .",
    "we have derived from m12 a mild and a hard dependence of the igimf on the average galaxy metallicity and we have calculated the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus accordingly .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    * dwarf galaxies characterised by low sfrs , i.e. sfrs smaller than 10@xmath60 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 , can show very low [ o / fe ] or [ mg / fe ] plateaus , up to 0.7 dex lower than the mw [ o , mg / fe ] plateau .",
    "this is at variance with observations , indicating [ mg / fe ] plateaus in dwarf galaxies only moderately lower than the milky way [ mg / fe ] value . on the other hand , at sfrs smaller than @xmath40 10@xmath61 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 , the [ o , mg / fe ] plateau can be much larger and consistent with observations . *",
    "if the sfr of the dwarf galaxy is larger than 10@xmath60 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 , then the variations of the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus with sfr are of the order of 0.2 dex at most . *",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus depend on the ( uncertain ) stellar yields between 8 and 12 m@xmath3 . *",
    "the slope @xmath25 of the mass distribution function of star clusters has a significant impact , too , on the chemical abundance pattern . *",
    "our study of the observed [ mg / fe ] plateau in local dwarf galaxies suggests that they should be characterised by early sfrs either of the order of 10@xmath59 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 or larger than 10@xmath60 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 .",
    "however , in the former hypothesis , given the steep [ mg / fe]-sfr relation predicted within the igimf , it seems difficult to conceive similar [ mg / fe ] ratios in different galaxies as observed today .",
    "it is also worth stressing that current determinations of the early sfrs in dwarf galaxies tend to be lower than 10@xmath60 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 .",
    "we have argued though that these sfr estimate are necessarily lower limits because they can not take into account stars stripped off the main body of the dwarf galaxy by tidal interactions .",
    "* for the first time , we have considered the effects of a metallicity dependent imf on the chemical abundance ratios . in case of a weak dependence of the imf on [ fe / h ] ,",
    "our results do not change substantially from the ones of the z - independent imf .",
    "the minimum of [ mg / fe ] as a function of the sfr lies @xmath56 0.2 dex above the corresponding minimum for the standard , non metallicity - dependent igimf model . for this model",
    ", there is agreement between model predictions and observations provided that the early star formation in the dwarf galaxies is larger than @xmath40 6 @xmath57 10@xmath58 m@xmath3 y@xmath38 or smaller than @xmath40 4 @xmath57 10@xmath59 m@xmath3 y@xmath38 . *",
    "if instead the imf strongly depends on the metallicity ( hard model ) , galaxy models characterised by low sfrs will have flatter igimfs than galaxy models with high sfrs . unexpectedly",
    ", almost no dependence of the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateau on the sfr is predicted in this case .",
    "the predicted [ mg / fe ] ratio is very close to the one observed in the most metal - poor stars of the milky way and only slightly larger than that observed in local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "the enormous progress made recently in the determination of the star formation histories and of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of the most metal - poor stars in local dwarf galaxies offers a valuable benchmark for chemical evolution studies .",
    "the next few years will see an increase of the samples of stars with observable abundances in low - mass , low metallicity galaxies",
    ". with improved statistics and more homogeneous data , our predictions for the variation of the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus as a function of the sfr , will represent valuable tools to constrain the most basic chemical evolution parameters of dwarf galaxies , such as the imf and the star formation history .    to conclude , given the uncertainties related to the early star formation rates in dwarf galaxies , we believe there are two ways to better assess the reliability or our results : @xmath62 : a better and more precise determination of the [ @xmath0/fe ] plateaus in satellite dwarf galaxies , to check whether these plateaus , at least for some galaxies , could really differ from the mw halo values . @xmath63 a more direct determination of the imf in low - metallicity dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. zhang et al .",
    "2007 ) which could be directly used as an input for our models for calculating abundance ratios of metal - poor stars in dgss .",

    "( 2008 ) show different simulations of the evolution of mw - like galaxies and the average sfr in the early phases is much larger than 0.5 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 , reaching sfrs up to @xmath56 2030 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 .",
    "we have repeated the calculations of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios using a sfr of 100 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 , the largest sfr considered by r09 .",
    "the results differ very little from the ones presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit2 ] : the [ o / fe ] ratios are at most 0.015 dex larger than the reference values .",
    "this confirms the general conclusion of r09 that only for sfrs below 0.10.01 m@xmath3 yr@xmath38 are the deviations of the igimf from a standard ( not sfr - dependent ) imf significant .",
    "yields above 40 m@xmath3 turn out to affect negligibly our results .",
    "even if we increase the iron yields above 40 m@xmath3 by a factor of 10@xmath67 , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios change by less than 0.01 dex ( see table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "we have also varied the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 characterising the dependence of the maximum embedded cluster mass @xmath32 and the sfr in eq .",
    "[ eq : igimf ] .",
    "a variation of @xmath68 of the order of 0.5 and of @xmath69 of the order of 0.1 change very little our results .",
    "in fact , [ o / fe ] changes by @xmath40 0.05 dex at most .",
    "we remind however that the correlation between @xmath70 and @xmath31 is based on observations , therefore it should not be subject to large variations .",
    "we have varied also the assumed lower mass for an embedded cluster @xmath71 5 m@xmath3 and the theoretical upper stellar mass within an embedded cluster @xmath72 150 m@xmath3 ( see table [ table1 ] ) that are used in the igimf formula ( eq . [ eq : plateau ] ) . since the upper end of the igimf is affected by the most massive star cluster , not by the smallest ones , assuming @xmath73 larger than 5 m@xmath3 produces negligible effects . for instance ,",
    "if we take @xmath74 m@xmath3 we obtain results differing by less than @xmath40 0.01 dex compared to the reference models . since the work of crowther et al .",
    "( 2010 ) indicates the existence of stars with masses larger than 150 m@xmath3 , it is worth studying what changes in our results if we assume @xmath72 300 m@xmath3 . at low",
    "sfrs the results with @xmath72 300 m@xmath3 are practically indistinguishable from the ones we have presented so far .",
    "this is understandable because in this case the upper mass predicted by the igimf theory is much below 150 m@xmath3 . at large sfrs , some differences start emerging , but they never exceed @xmath40 0.030.04 dex . again , these results are summarised in table [ table3 ] ."
