    "high mass x - ray binaries host a compact object ( a neutron star or a black hole ) and a massive star ( liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel 2000 , 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the major subclass of high mass x - ray binaries consists of a be star and a compact object and they are referred to as be x - ray binaries ( be xrbs , e.g. , hayasaki & okazaki 2005 ; 2006 ) .",
    "the be stars are massive , generally main sequence , stars of spectral types a0-o8 with balmer emission lines ( zorec & briot 1997 , negueruela 1998 ) .",
    "the be xrbs are found with rather wide ( orbital periods in the range of @xmath5 days ) and frequently eccentric orbit and a compact object accretes from the wind of a be star ( even massive be stars are within their roche lobes for these wide orbits ) . at present , @xmath0 be xrbs are known in the galaxy , and in @xmath1 the compact object was confirmed to be a neutron star ( ns ) by the presence of the x - ray pulsations ( see table  [ galactic ] ) . in the remaining cases , whenever we have information concerning the nature of the compact component ( such as an x - ray spectrum ) , it also indicates a ns . although one can not exclude that a few of these systems contain white dwarfs or black holes , it is fair to state that majority of them contain nss as compact components .",
    "other classes of xrbs are ( with one exception ) less numerous . we know",
    "@xmath6 x - ray bursters ( which all host nss ) and @xmath7 x - ray pulsars not associated with a be type companion ( @xmath8 of these nss are associated with a supergiant type companion and @xmath9 with a low mass companion ) .",
    "in addition , we know @xmath10 black hole candidate systems ( among them 21 confirmed bh systems ; e.g. , orosz 2003 ; casares 2007 ; ziolkowski 2008 )",
    ". however , not a single black hole binary containing a be type component has been found so far .",
    "this disparity , @xmath1 be xrbs with nss versus not a single one with a bh , seems indeed striking .",
    "the x - ray emission from be xrbs ( with a few exceptions ) is of a distinctly transient nature with rather short active phases separated by much longer quiescent intervals ( a flaring behavior ) .",
    "there are two types of flares , which are classified as type i outbursts ( smaller and regularly repeating ) and type ii outbursts ( larger and irregular ; negueruela & okazaki 2001 , negueruela et al .",
    "type i bursts are observed in systems with highly eccentric orbits .",
    "they occur close to periastron passages of a ns .",
    "they are repeating at intervals @xmath11 .",
    "type ii bursts may occur at any orbital phase .",
    "they are correlated with the disruption of the excretion disc around be star ( as observed in h@xmath12 line ) .",
    "they repeat on time scale of the dynamical evolution of the excretion disc ( @xmath13 few to few tens of years ) .",
    "this recurrence time scale is generally much longer than the orbital period ( negueruela et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "be xrbs systems are known to contain two discs : excretion disc around be star and accretion disc around neutron star .",
    "both discs are temporary : excretion disc disperses and refills on time scales @xmath13 few to few tens of years ( dynamical evolution of the disc , formerly known as the `` activity of a be star '' ( negueruela et al .",
    "2001 ) , while the accretion disc disperses and refills on time scales @xmath13 weeks to months ( which is related to the orbital motion on an eccentric orbit and , on some occasions , also to the major instabilities of the excretion disc ) .",
    "the accretion disc might be absent over a longer period of time ( @xmath13 years ) , if the other disc is very weak or absent .",
    "the x - ray emission of be xrbs binaries is controlled by the centrifugal gate mechanism , which , in turn , is operated both by the periastron passages ( type i bursts ) and by the dynamical evolution of the excretion disc ( both types of bursts ) .",
    "this mechanism explains the transient nature of the x - ray emission ( see ziolkowski 2002 and references therein ) .    one should add that the excretion discs are not a mystery any more . in recent years",
    ", the outflowing viscous excretion discs were used to describe the circumstellar matter around be stars known earlier as `` an envelope of a be star '' ( okazaki 1997 ; porter 1999 ; negueruela & okazaki 2001 ) . the modeling with the help of the viscous excretion discs appeared to be by far more successful in describing the circumstellar matter , than earlier descriptions in terms of `` equatorial winds '' , `` expanding envelopes '' or `` ejected shells '' . in particular , the viscous disc models were able to explain the very low outflow velocities ( the observed upper limits are , at most , a few km  s@xmath14 and , also , to explain the ( so called ) v / r variability , observed in be stars .",
    "the viscous excretion discs are very similar to the , well known , viscous accretion discs , except for the changed sign of the rate of the mass flow .",
    "some aspects of the modeling ( the supply of the matter with the sufficient angular momentum to the inner edge of the disc , the interaction of the stellar radiation with the matter of the disc ) are not fully solved yet , but the general picture is quite convincing . the viscosity in the excretion discs is usually assumed ( similarly as for accretion discs ) to be in the form of @xmath12-viscosity .",
    "the discs are almost keplerian ( rotationally supported ) which explains the very low values of the radial component of velocity .",
    "nearly keplerian discs ( both inflowing and outflowing ) were , since a long time , known to undergo a global one - armed oscillation instability ( kato 1983 ) .",
    "this instability ( progressing density waves ) provide a very successful explanation of v / r variability , observed both in isolated be stars and in members of be / x - ray systems .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself in the form of quasi - cyclical changes of the ratio of the strengths of the v(iolet ) peak to the r(ed ) peak in the double profile emission lines .",
    "this variability ( best seen for the h@xmath15 line ) includes phases , when only one peak is visible .",
    "the time scales of the quasi - cycles range from months to years or decades .",
    "the theoretical line profiles calculated for the discs with an asymmetric matter distribution ( due to progressing density waves ) were found to be in good agreement with the observed profiles ( okazaki 1996 ; hummel & hanuschik 1997 ) .",
    "also the theoretical time scales calculated for the one - armed oscillation instability agreed with the observed time scales of v / r variability ( negueruela et al .",
    "the one - armed instability leads ultimately to the disruption of the disc and ejection of the matter from its outer rim .",
    "this phenomenon is believed to be responsible for type ii bursts .",
    "therefore , these time scales describe also the recurrence of type ii bursts .",
    "the total number of be xrbs in the galaxy is difficult to estimate .",
    "the typical duty cycle ( the relative length of the interval of the high x - ray emission , during which the system might be detected ) is rather small : @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( with the exception of a few persistent sources ) .",
    "the coverage of the sky by x - ray surveys is very far from complete .",
    "many systems lie in the obscured regions of the galaxy and they might be detected only in hard x - rays . with the exception of integral ( hard x - ray capability which has led to the discovery of many new be xrbs ; bird et al . 2007 ) , these systems are undetectable by most x - ray observatories . since most of",
    "be xrbs are dormant at any given moment , we can expect to discover many new such systems in near future .",
    "it might be estimated that the total number of be xrbs in the galaxy is perhaps an order or two orders of magnitude larger than the number of the presently known systems ( e.g. , rappaport & van den heuvel 1982 ; van den heuvel & rappaport 1987 ) .    in a series of conference proceeding papers ( sadowski et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b , 2008c ) we have reported a potential solution to the problem of the missing black hole be x - ray binaries .",
    "this solution was incorrect and we want to stress to not use these papers .",
    "the errors were made in population synthesis result analysis . in this study , we have performed the calculations anew and we have double checked our analysis .",
    "additionally , all the calculations were performed with the revised code ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "the new results along with the new and qualitatively different solution to the missing problem are presented in this study .    in this work",
    "we study the origins of the apparent disparity of number of known be xrbs with nss ( @xmath1 ) as compared to no known be xrbs with bhs in galaxy .",
    "this disparity has been noted in the literature for some time .",
    "the first stellar population synthesis calculations intended to estimate the number of black hole be x - ray binaries were carried out by raguzova & lipunov ( 1999 ) .",
    "they _ assumed _ that a ratio of be x - ray binaries with a ns to the ones with a bh is @xmath18 .",
    "this was based on @xmath19 galactic ns be x - ray binaries known at that time and the assumption that grs 1915 + 105 is a bh be x - ray binary .",
    "we know now that this is not the case and that grs 1915 + 105 is a low mass x - ray binary with the donor star being a low mass ( k - m ) giant ( e.g. , greiner et al . 2001 ) .",
    "they demonstrated that by adjusting some evolutionary parameters ( e.g. , natal kicks , the initial star mass that divides a ns from a bh formation ) their model can reproduce the ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "however , some of their adjustments seem to be rather extreme in the light of the current understanding of binary evolution . for example",
    ", they needed to assume that stars form black holes _ only _ if their mass is higher than @xmath20 and that _ each _ main sequence star above @xmath21 becomes a be star after a mass accretion episode . another population synthesis study connected to the be phenomenon",
    "was presented by zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in this study",
    "it was noted that , according to the stellar population synthesis calculations by podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , bh binaries are predominantly formed with relatively short orbital periods ( @xmath22days ) . if this is the case , then , according to zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the excretion disc truncation mechanism ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) might be so efficient that the accretion rate is very low and the system remains dormant ( and therefore invisible ) almost all the time .",
    "one should note , however , that podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) considered essentially bh systems with roche lobe filling secondaries , definitely not the case for be xrbs ( wind - fed accretion ; e.g. negueruela 1998 ; ziolkowski 2002 ) .",
    "we want to stress that in this paper we consider only galactic be xrbs .",
    "however , it should be added that there exists a large population of be xrbs in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "it is even larger than that of the galaxy : @xmath23 known systems with @xmath24 containing a confirmed pulsar ; ziolkowski , unpublished compilation .",
    "moreover , this population is growing very fast . taking into account that the total stellar content of the magellanic clouds is much smaller than the galactic one",
    ", the study of the origin of this population might be very interesting .",
    "due to very different properties of stellar populations ( e.g. , lower metallicity , different star formation history ) we defer the study of be xrbs in the magellanic clouds to another paper .",
    "binary population synthesis is used to calculate the population of massive stars ( spectral types b / o ) that are in binaries with a compact object ; either a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the population synthesis code employed in this work , startrack , was initially developed for the study of double compact object mergers in the context of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) progenitors ( belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002a ) and gravitational - wave inspiral sources ( belczynski , kalogera & bulik 2002b ) .",
    "single stellar evolution is based mostly on the modified set of stellar models of hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) while binary evolution procedures were independently developed for this code .    in recent years startrack",
    "has undergone major updates and revisions in the physical treatment of various binary evolution phases , and especially mass transfer phases . the new version has already been tested and calibrated against observations and detailed binary mass transfer calculations ( belczynski et al .",
    "2008 ) , and has been used in various applications .",
    "the physics updates that are most important for compact object formation and evolution include : ( i ) a full numerical approach to orbital evolution due to tidal interactions , calibrated using high mass x - ray binaries and open cluster observations ; ( ii ) a detailed treatment of mass transfer episodes fully calibrated against detailed calculations with a stellar evolution code ; ( iii ) updated stellar winds for massive stars ( see belczynski et al .",
    "2009a ) ; and ( iv ) the latest determination of the natal kick velocity distribution for neutron stars ( hobbs et al .",
    "2005 ) . for he",
    "star evolution , which is of crucial importance for the formation of double neutron star binaries ( e.g.  ivanova et al .",
    "2003 ; dewi & pols 2003 ) , we have applied a treatment matching closely the results of detailed evolutionary calculations .",
    "if the he star expands and roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) begins , the systems are examined for the potential development of a dynamical instability , in which case they are evolved through a common envelope ( ce ) phase , otherwise a highly non - conservative mass transfer ensues .",
    "we treat ce events using the energy formalism ( webbink 1984 ) , where the binding energy of the envelope is determined from the set of he star models calculated with the detailed evolutionary code by ivanova et al .",
    "the progenitor evolution and roche lobe overflow episodes are now followed in much greater detail .",
    "in particular the code was calibrated for various cases of mass transfer in massive binaries and then tested against some published detailed evolutionary tracks ( e.g.  wellstein , langer & brown 2001 ) .    one specific evolutionary process that plays an important role for the formation of binaries with black holes is the ce phase .",
    "this phase is instrumental in decreasing orbital separation and bringing initially distant binary components close to each other .",
    "this in turn allows components of many systems to begin an interaction and manifest their presence through a number of observational phenomena .",
    "the inspiral process in common envelope and the subsequent decrease of an orbit is not well understood .",
    "it is believed that only donor stars ( initiating the process ) with the well developed core - envelope structure , like red giants , can successfully survive the inspiral . on the other hand stars with no clear core - envelope boundary , like main sequence stars , can not survive this phase , leading to a ce merger and formation of one , rapidly rotating and peculiar star .",
    "it was pointed out that stars crossing the hertzsprung gap ( hg ) do not have a clear entropy jump at the core - envelope transition ( ivanova & taam 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that if such a star overflows its roche lobe and initiates a ce phase the inspiral will eventually lead to a merger ( e.g. taam & sandquist 2000 ) .",
    "this possibility was tested in evolutionary calculations of merger rates of double compact objects .",
    "it turns out that if such a possibility is accounted for , the merger rates of bh - bh binaries decrease drastically ( by factor of @xmath25 ) .",
    "ns - ns merger rates drop only moderately ( belczynski et al . 2007 ) .",
    "since the details of the ce phase are not fully understood , in this study we will also test this possibility in our predictions for be x - ray binaries . in model",
    "a , we will allow for survival even if a donor star is on the hg ( i.e. , standard energy balance is calculated to check on the outcome of ce ) , while in model b , any ce phase that involves an hg donor is _ assumed _ to lead to a merger aborting subsequent binary evolution and potential formation of a be x - ray binary .",
    "another important factor that determines the formation efficiencies of binaries with neutron stars and black holes is the natal kick compact objects receive at birth . for models",
    "a and b we adopt natal kicks from the radio pulsar birth velocity distribution derived by hobbs et al .",
    "( 2005 ; a maxwellian with @xmath26  km  s@xmath14 ) for neutron stars that are formed in regular core - collapse supernovae , while for neutron stars formed in electron capture supernovae we adopt no natal kicks ( e.g.  dessart et al .",
    "natal kicks for black holes are decreased proportionally to the amount of fall back expected during core collapse / supernova explosion ( e.g.  fryer 1999 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "however , we calculate one extra model in which natal kicks are reduced .",
    "in particular , in model c , neutron star kicks are drawn from a maxwellian distribution with @xmath27  km  s@xmath14 , while black hole kicks are derived from the same distribution but then decreased due to the fall back . for the electron capture neutron star formation",
    ", no natal kicks are applied .",
    "there are some indications that the natal kicks neutron stars receive are smaller for stars in binaries as compared with single stars ( e.g.  podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2004 ) . here",
    "we have decreased the value of kicks as measured by hobbs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for single pulsars by half and applied them to neutron stars in binaries .",
    "this specific choice was motivated by the recent calculation that demonstrated that in order to reproduce the ratio of recycled pulsars in double neutron star binaries ( 9 known ) to single recycled pulsars ( 4 ) the kicks operating in binary stars are required to be rather low ( @xmath28 km s@xmath14 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2009b ) .",
    "delineation in the formation of neutron stars and black holes may play an important role in the expected number of be x - ray binaries with different accretors .",
    "in particular , we still do not know what a star in the initial mass range of @xmath29 forms : a neutron star or a black hole ?",
    "in this study we have employed a physical model for the formation of compact object , and rather than using a star initial mass ( as most population synthesis codes do ) , we have used the star properties to delineate the formation of a neutron star from the formation of a black hole . in short ,",
    "we follow the evolution of a given star , note the final mass of its feni core and then we use the results of hydro core - collapse simulations to estimate the mass of the compact object a given star forms .",
    "once we have the mass of a compact object we use the maximum neutron star mass ( assumed to be @xmath30 ) to tell apart neutron stars from black holes .",
    "the full description of this scheme is given in belczynski et al .",
    "( 2008 ; and see the references within ) . as it happens our scheme ( for single stars ) results in the black hole formation for @xmath31 ( see belczynski et al .",
    "if we wanted to ( artificially ) adopt a higher limit ( e.g. , @xmath32 ) , we would expect more be x - ray binaries with neutron stars than predicted in the following sections .",
    "in other words , our conclusions are rather conservative on the estimate of the ratio of be x - ray binaries with neutron stars to the ones with black holes . if anything such a ratio should be higher and our conclusions that follow stronger .",
    "we evolve a galactic population of massive binaries using startrack .",
    "we adopt solar metallicity ( @xmath33 ) , and a steep initial mass function ( imf ) for massive stars with a power - law exponent of @xmath34 ( kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ; kroupa & weidner 2003 ) .",
    "roche lobe overflow is treated in a non - conservative way ( with @xmath35 mass loss from a given binary ; e.g.  meurs & van den heuvel 1989 ) while the ce phase is treated via energy balance with fully efficient transfer of orbital energy into dispersal of an envelope ( e.g.  @xmath36 ) .",
    "the results are calibrated in such a way that the galactic star formation rate is at the level of @xmath37 and is constant through the last 10  gyr ( e.g.  oshaughnessy et al .",
    "2006 ) . at the present galactic disk age ( @xmath38 gyr )",
    "we perform a time slice and extract be x - ray binaries using classification criteria defined in the following section .      following the earlier discussion (  1 ) of the observed properties of galactic population of",
    "be x - ray binaries , we adopt a definition ( that is extended to potential systems that may host a bh ) of a be x - ray binary in our population synthesis calculations .",
    "we call any system a be x - ray binary if : _",
    "( i ) _ it hosts either a ns or a bh accretor ; _ ( ii ) _ donor is a main sequence star ( burning h in its core ) ; _ ( iii ) _ donor mass is high @xmath39 ( o / b star ) ; _ ( iv ) _ accretion proceeds _ only _ via stellar wind ( no rlof ) ; _ ( v ) _",
    "orbital period is in the range @xmath40 day ; and _ ( vi ) _ only a fraction @xmath41 of the above systems are designated as hosting a be star and not a regular o / b star .",
    "the observations indicate that the fraction of be stars among all b stars is @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( e.g. , slettebak 1988 ; ziolkowski 2002 ; mcswain & gies 2005 ) .",
    "note that in the above definition we do not require a non - zero eccentricity as for the galactic bexrbs as many as @xmath44 systems have small eccentricity ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we have chosen to define be x - ray binary in a phenomenological way , and based on the observational properties we have adopted the values for our limiting factors ( e.g. , @xmath46 ) .",
    "note also , that we do not have put any constrains on the spin of a be star .",
    "it translates into an assumption ( as be stars are known to have high rotational velocities ; e.g. , slettebak 1949 , 1966 ; slettebak , collins & truax 1992 ) that either some stars are born with initially high spins or that the mass accretion during rlof can effectively spin up a massive star . the more physical approach",
    "( e.g. , b star becomes be star if spun up via rlof accretion ) is also potentially possible within the framework of our population synthesis model .",
    "however , the details of such a model would be highly uncertain ( e.g. , the high spin of be stars may be connected to their initial rapid rotation and not to rlof spin up ; it is not certain if any spin up is expected during ce phase ; and how effectively angular momentum can be transferred during rlof ) .",
    "we note that the adopted value of @xmath46 affects only the absolute number of be x - ray binaries predicted in our calculations .",
    "however , the physical properties or the relative ratio of be x - ray binaries hosting a ns to the ones hosting a bh remains the same and therefore our results and conclusions ( see below ) are independent of the value we adopt for @xmath46 .",
    "in table  [ channels ] , the main results of our calculations are presented .",
    "the main formation channels for be x - ray binaries are given separately for systems with nss ( marked @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a number that indicates a given channel ) and bhs ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we also list the predicted intrinsic galactic number of be x - ray binaries ( @xmath50 ) , along with the expected ratio of systems with nss to systems with bhs ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "binaries with ns form mostly along two channels . one ( @xmath52 ; that forms @xmath53 of be x - ray binaries with nss ) involves a ce phase when the primary is an evolved star ( e.g.  burning he in its core , or burning h and he in a shell ) and after losing the envelope , the combination of the post - ce orbital separation ( rather large ) and maximum radius of exposed primary core ( not too large ) is such that there are no more interactions until the primary s exposed core explodes and forms a ns . the other channel ( @xmath54 ;",
    "@xmath53 ) involves also the initial ce phase , but it usually starts on a smaller orbit , so the post - ce separation is such that it allows the exposed core of primary ( naked he star ) to overflow its roche lobe and start another interaction ( non conservative mass transfer ) before it explodes and forms a ns . there is also one channel ( @xmath55 ; @xmath17 ) that involves two binary components of comparable mass , and once rlof begins it does not develop into a ce phase but proceeds via regular and not too violent way ( on a thermal and/or nuclear timescale of the donor ) .",
    "after the rlof episode the primary explodes and forms a ns . at the time of ns formation",
    "the companion is a still unevolved ( main sequence ) star with high mass ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "there is not much difference from model a to b in the formation of be x - ray binaries with nss .",
    "the formation of be x - ray binaries with bhs proceeds along two channels .",
    "the first one ( @xmath57 ) is very similar to @xmath52 and involves a ce phase followed by the explosion of a primary and the formation of a bh .",
    "the main difference comes from the fact that in this case the primary is more massive ( than a progenitor of a ns in @xmath52 ) and it starts a ce phase earlier in its evolution .",
    "the ce phase is encountered very often when a primary is crossing the hg , as it is the first evolutionary phase at which the stars undergo a very significant radial expansion . since we impose non survival in such a case for our model b , we note the significant decrease of formation of be x - ray binaries in this channel from model a ( @xmath58 ) to model b ( @xmath17 )",
    ". the second formation channel ( @xmath59 ) of be x - ray binaries with bhs is almost the same as the channel @xmath55 for binaries with ns .",
    "since this channel involves only one non - conservative rlof , the change from model a ( @xmath44 ) to model b ( @xmath60 ) is only relative .",
    "this change simply reflects the decrease of number of binaries in channel @xmath57 and the actual number of binaries in the channel @xmath59 does not change from model a to b.    we also present the predicted numbers of be x - ray binaries calibrated for the galactic disk star formation rate . we have selected ( randomly ) only @xmath61 ( @xmath41 ) of the massive binaries hosting b / o star with a compact object companion as this seems to be the fraction of be stars among regular b stars and we have additionally imposed some constraints on orbital period and system configuration ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "the number of predicted be x - ray binaries with nss is @xmath62 and does not depend much on the adopted model of ce evolution .",
    "the number of be x - ray binaries with bhs is significantly smaller and is sensitive to the adopted ce model ; we find @xmath63 and @xmath64 systems for model a and model b , respectively .",
    "this is qualitatively the same trend as found by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who demonstrated that ce survival / non - survival affects mostly systems with bhs .    in each model",
    "we predict more be xrbs with nss than with bhs .",
    "in general there are more nss than bhs ( @xmath65 ; the ratio that depends on adopted imf and the details of the transition from ns to bh formation ) .",
    "additionally , binaries with initially comparable mass components ( like progenitors of be x - ray binaries with nss ) are more likely to survive the first interaction ( usually ce phase ) than the binaries with components of very different masses ( like for many progenitors of be x - ray binaries with bhs ) .",
    "the number of be xrbs with nss is about the same in both models , but the number of binaries with bhs decreases significantly from model a to b. therefore , the ratio of be xrbs with nss to the ones with bhs changes significantly from model a ( @xmath66 ) to model b ( @xmath67 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ perioda ] and  [ periodb ] we present the distributions of orbital periods and eccentricities for the synthetic be x - ray binaries for models a and b. due to the small number of binaries predicted in the galaxy , the distributions are constructed from the entire population of potential be x - ray binaries ( i.e.  @xmath68 ) .",
    "the actual population of synthetic galactic be x - ray binaries as listed in table  [ channels ] ( i.e.  @xmath41 ) is constructed by random drawing from the distributions shown in figs .  [ perioda ] and  [ periodb ] .",
    "orbital periods are contained within @xmath40 days by our adopted definition of be x - ray binaries ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "the distributions within these limits are falling off with increasing periods and this general trend holds for both be x - ray binaries with nss and bhs .",
    "the relatively large numbers of systems with small periods are the outcome of the orbital contraction at ce phase .",
    "this is indirectly , but very clearly , demonstrated on the example of be x - ray binaries with bhs in model b ( fig .",
    "[ periodb ] ) in which the majority systems do not evolve through a ce phase and there are almost no binaries with small periods ( e.g. , with @xmath69 days ) .",
    "the eccentricity distributions are similar for models a and b. for be x - ray binaries with nss there is an overall trend of distributions with rising eccentricity .",
    "this is an effect of natal kicks that are rather high ( @xmath70 km s@xmath14 ) so binaries in general receive high kicks and gain significant eccentricity after the first supernova .",
    "it is noted that we only plot here the tail of entire population of initial binaries that may have became be x - ray binaries , but were disrupted in the first supernova . actually , the disruption at the first supernova for massive binaries is very high ( @xmath71 ) and only a very few binaries survive .",
    "there is also an accumulation of systems with very small eccentricities ( @xmath72 ) and this is due to the population of neutron stars that form through electron capture supernovae for which we have assumed no natal kicks , so the non - zero ( but small ) eccentricities for these systems arise from mass loss only .",
    "the general trends are very similar for distributions of eccentricities for be x - ray binaries with bhs .",
    "however , we note two natural changes in relative strengths of the trends as compared to distributions of binaries with nss . first , the increase of distribution with eccentricity is smaller for binaries with bhs , as these receive , on average , lower natal kicks than nss ( due to the fall back and smaller explosion energies in bh formation ) .",
    "second , the contribution of bh binaries with small eccentricities is higher than for binaries with nss .",
    "the most massive black holes form through direct collapse ( or almost full fall back ) for which we assume no ( or rather small ) natal kicks and since there is no ( or almost no ) mass loss , these systems end up with zero ( or very small ) eccentricities .",
    "in model c we have decreased the natal kicks nss and bhs receive and this model is similar to model b as in this calculation we do not allow for the ce survival if a donor is a hg star .",
    "the formation channels and corresponding efficiencies are about the same as for model b. however , as intuitively expected , the formation of binaries with nss increases ( @xmath73 ) significantly as compared to other models ( see table  [ channels ] ) . since most progenitors of be xrbs are disrupted at the formation of a compact object ( via supernova natal kick ) once the kicks are decreased the formation is more efficient .",
    "the same effect is found for be xrbs with bhs ( @xmath74 ) , although at a lesser degree as bh kicks are assumed to be smaller and therefore the disruptions are not as important a factor as for binaries with nss .",
    "this trend significantly increases number of be xrbs with nss and only moderately increases the number of the binaries with bhs .",
    "it therefore has a deep impact on the expected ratio of one population to the other .",
    "in particular , the ratio of be xrbs with ns to ones with bhs is found very high for model c : @xmath75 . in fig .",
    "[ periodc ] we show period and eccentricity distributions for model c.",
    "we have performed a population synthesis study of galactic be x - ray binaries . in particular ,",
    "we have attempted to explain the problem of the missing be x - ray binaries with bhs . the only known be x - ray binaries with a confirmed type of compact object host nss .",
    "specifically , we know 64 be x - ray binaries in the galaxy , but only 42 of these systems are known to host a ns .",
    "none of the observed be x - ray binaries hosts a bh .",
    "* previously , we have reported ( sadowski et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b , 2008c ) the potential solution to the problem of the missing be x - ray binaries .",
    "this solution was incorrect and the mistake was due to some errors in population synthesis data analysis .",
    "the new results ( double - checked and obtained with the updated code ) are presented below . *",
    "we predict that both population of be x - ray binaries should exist in the galaxy : those with nss as well as these with bhs . *",
    "the predicted number of be x - ray binaries with nss is much higher ( factors of @xmath2 ) than those with bhs . *",
    "if we use the preferred evolutionary models ( @xmath76 ; models b and c ) we predict that in the observed sample of be x - ray binaries of 42 systems with nss , one should expect only @xmath4 systems with bhs .",
    "it is quite possible that none are yet observed ( small statistics ) . * due to a very low number of expected binaries with bhs , it is very likely that there is no problem with missing be x - ray binaries with bhs in galaxy .",
