    "block copolymers are macromolecules built with blocks of chemically distinct monomers .",
    "melts of block copolymers are attractive from both theoretical and experimental standpoints , as they undergo microphase transitions and produce diverse ordered microstructures @xcite .",
    "the simplest block copolymer is the @xmath1 diblock copolymer made of two types of monomers @xmath2 and @xmath3 . below the order - disorder transition ( odt ) temperature , a diblock - copolymer melt can exhibit rich mesophases @xcite , including body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) , hexagonally ordered cylinder ( hex ) , lamellar ( lam ) , and several bicontinuous ( e.g. , gyroid ) structures . experimentally these structures have been identified using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) @xcite , small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) @xcite , and dynamic mechanical measurements @xcite .",
    "theoretically these structures are well described by the self - consistent  mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "generally these periodically ordered structures are expected to be the thermodynamically equilibrium states @xcite . however , they are difficult to attain either in experiments @xcite or in computer simulations @xcite .",
    "bates and co - workers @xcite found that quenching a nearly symmetric diblock - copolymer melt without symmetry - breaking external field , such as reciprocal shearing , generally results in isotropic , locally microphase - separated structures with a characteristic length scale of the radius of gyration of the polymer .",
    "in addition , such structures were also obtained ( as a rule ) in dynamic - density - functional calculations @xcite .",
    "the ordering kinetics in these random structures are very slow , suggesting that they are metastable states corresponding to free - energy minima .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that the ordered phases , though energetically favored , are not easily reached due to the kinetic trapping caused by the presence of a large number of metastable free - energy minima .",
    "these metastable states correspond to the locally microphase - separated states without long - range order .",
    "dynamic mechanical measurements by bates and co - workers on melts of both symmetric , lamellae - forming , and asymmetric , hex - forming pe  pep [ partially deuterated poly(ethylene - propylene)poly(ethylethylene ) ] copolymers revealed @xcite that the system may be frozen in random structures upon a deep quench . comparing the quenched sample with the slowly - supercooled sample and the shear - ordered sample , they found that the quenched sample exhibits very slow relaxations and extraordinarily large elastic moduli at low frequencies ; but the supercooled sample behaves more like the disordered melt continuously extended to below the odt temperature .",
    "balsara and co - workers @xcite studied the grain structure of asymmetric , hex - forming pi - ps ( polyisoprene  polystyrene ) melt by light scattering , sans , and rheological measurements .",
    "similar to the findings of bates _",
    "et  al . _",
    ", they found that upon a deep quench , randomly microphase - separated structures are obtained , which do not appear to evolve towards the equilibrium structure with long range order within the time scales of the experiments . besides these ,",
    "pochan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found randomly oriented wormlike cylinder structures in an i@xmath4s [ polyisoprene(i)-polystyrene(s ) ] star copolymer system , .",
    "the above results suggest that the ordering process in block - copolymer melts follow a two - step mechanism : a fast step in which unlike monomers locally phase separate into random , macroscopically isotropic structures with domains of the size of a single polymer , followed by a domain coarsening ( or growth ) step in which local defects in the random microstructures anhilate and long range order is developed .",
    "the second step is generally much slower than the first and most likely involves activated processes .",
    "therefore a rapid deep quench can result in randomly microphase - separated structures that are kinetically trapped and unable to develop long range order within normal laboratory time scales .",
    "this two - step mechanism is in fact consistent with the thermodynamic two - step scenario implicit in the fredrickson - helfand ( fh ) fluctuation theory for diblock - copolymer melts @xcite ( which only applies to symmetric or nearly symmetric copolymers ) . instead of the featureless background",
    "as assumed in the random - field - approximated structure factor of leibler @xcite , the fh theory suggests that when the temperature approaches the odt , the disordered state is a fluctuating , heterogeneous structure consisting of locally @xmath2- and @xmath3-rich domains , which then orders into periodic mesophases upon further cooling .",
    "the most dramatic manifestation of the first step is the existence of disordered - spherical - micelle state in highly asymmetric copolymer melts , which almost has the appearance of a distinct phase between the featureless disordered phase and the bcc - ordered phase @xcite .",
    "the micelle state was first predicted by semenov @xcite .",
    "recently dormidontova and lodge @xcite extended the semenov theory by including the translational entropy of the disordered spherical micelles and predicted a phase diagram that is in qualitative agreement with experiments .",
    "more recently , wang and co - workers @xcite examined the nature of the disordered spherical micelles and their connection to concentration fluctuations using the self - consistent - field theory . taking a nucleation perspective , these authors showed that the disordered micelles are large , localized concentration fluctuations through a thermally activated process .    in this work",
    ", we study the metastable states consisting of random structures in block - copolymer melts and address the possibility of glass transition using a thermodynamic replica approach .",
    "this approach was first proposed by monasson @xcite and subsequently employed by a number of authors in studying structural glass transitions @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the onset of glassiness is identified with broken ergodicity @xcite , which occurs as a result of the appearance of an exponentially large number of metastable free - energy minima @xcite .",
    "the broken ergodicity is manifested through a nonvanishing long - time correlation ( here manifested as the cross replica correlation function ) , whose first appearance defines the onset temperature of glassiness @xmath5 ( also called the dynamic glass transition temperature @xcite ) .",
    "an equivalent kauzmann temperature @xmath6 as in molecular liquids @xcite can also be defined as signaling the complete vitrification of the random structures .",
    "the possibility of glass transitions in bicontinuous microemulsions  a system closely related to diblock copolymers",
    " was recently examined by wu , westfahl , schmalian and wolynes @xcite , using both a dynamic mode - coupling theory and the thermodynamic replica approach .",
    "there authors have also studied glass transitions in the coulomb - frustrated - magnet model using the replica method with a self - consistent - screening approximation @xcite and , more recently , a local - field calculation @xcite .",
    "both the microemulsion and the coulomb - frustrated - magnet systems belong to the general class of models first proposed by brazovskii @xcite , featuring the existence of low - energy excitations around some finite wave number @xmath7 and the formation of microphase - separated structures with length scales @xmath8 at low temperatures .",
    "these studies showed that as a result of the large degeneracy in ground states @xcite , a glass transition can occur when the ratio of the correlation length of the system to the modulation length @xmath9 exceeds some critical value .",
    "similar conclusions were also obtained by grousson _ et  al_. @xcite using the mode - coupling theory .",
    "our work follows a similar approach to that employed by schmalian and co - workers @xcite .",
    "however , we perform calculations specifically for the block - copolymer system by taking advantage of the natural smallness parameter ( the inverse of the scaled degree of polymerization , @xmath0 ) ; this allows us to study how the glass transitions are affected by increasing the chain length of the polymer when the system gradually approaches the mean - field limit .",
    "an important conclusion of our work is that in the limit of infinitely long chains , both the onset of glassiness and the kauzmann temperature coincide with the mean - field spinodal of the disordered phase .",
    "therefore the spinodal is the mean - field signature for the glass transition in the block copolymer system ; the same conclusion is likely to hold in general for microphase - separating systems .",
    "another feature of our work is the inclusion of the order - disorder transition in the phase diagram .",
    "this is important because it places the glass transition in proper relationship to the ordering transition .",
    "we find that , for symmetric , lam - forming copolymers , the glass - transition temperatures are below the odt temperature , while for asymmetric , sphere - forming copolymers , the onset of glassiness can precede the odt into the bcc phase . on a technical point , we propose a method for incorporating fluctuations due to the cubic interaction in the brazovskii model , using a renormalization scheme motivated by the @xmath10 expansion of the @xmath11-vector model in critical phenomena .",
    "the effects of these fluctuations have not been addressed in any of the previous studies @xcite on block - copolymer systems .",
    "we find that in the leading - order approximation these fluctuations stabilize both the bcc phase and the glassy state .",
    "we consider the melt of @xmath1 diblock copolymers of degree of polymerization @xmath12 and block composition @xmath13 .",
    "the monomer volume @xmath14 and kuhn length @xmath15 are taken to be equal for both monomers .",

    ", we drop the overbars on the variables and the order parameter henceforth .",
    "we point out that , although the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.11 ] ) are written in molecular terms , this model is best interpreted as phenomenological .",
    "the random - phase approximation used in deriving the hamiltonian , the approximation of higher - order interactions as spatially local , and the truncation at quartic order in the order - parameter expansion  all introduce inaccuracies whose effects are difficult to evaluate @xcite . in particular , the order - parameter expansion to quartic order is not justified for strongly asymmetric block compositions as chain stretching effects become important and the weak - segregation assumption no longer holds @xcite .",
    "however , we note that taking eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.11 ] ) as the hamiltonian , one can reproduce the experimental phase diagram of microphase transitions qualitatively at all compositions , including the disordered spherical - micelle states at very asymmetric compositions , as the state - of - the - art self - consistent - field theory . therefore while the quantitative accuracy of our theory may not be reliable , we expect that most of our predictions should be qualitatively correct .",

    "finally we notice that the parameter @xmath39 ( henceforth referred to as the `` chain length '' ) is a natural combination emerging in any study of the fluctuation effects in polymer melts , which gives the number of other chains within the spatial extension of a single polymer chain @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 plays a role similar to @xmath40 in quantum field theory @xcite  controlling the magnitude of fluctuations . in the limit of @xmath41 , mean - field behavior is recovered . for systems with large but finite @xmath0 we can apply a systematic loop expansion using @xmath42 as the smallness parameter .",
    "the presence of the @xmath43 factor in front of the hamiltonian also has important consequences on the free - energy barriers separating the multiplicity of free - energy minima . in the mean - field approximation",
    ", we expect that the free - energy barriers should be proportional to this factor . for long polymer chains , the barriers can be much larger than the thermal energy , resulting in slow relaxations from these free energy minima to the lower - free energy ordered phases and between the metastable minima themselves .",
    "this justifies the application of the energy - landscape theory of glass transitions in polymer systems .",
    "our current understanding of the effects of fluctuations on the odt in block - copolymer melts is largely based on the brazovskii - leibler - fredrickson - helfand ( blfh ) theory @xcite .",
    "this theory uses the self - consistent brazovskii approximation ( a hartree - type approximation ) for the quartic interaction and ignores fluctuations due to the cubic interaction .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , it is only valid for symmetric or nearly symmetric block copolymers where cubic interaction is small ( see our discussions at the end of this subsection ) .",
    "here we extend this theory to include the leading - order one - loop correction from the cubic interaction , which accounts for the fluctuation effects due to asymmetry in the copolymer composition .",

    "the mean - field spinodal is ultimately responsible for the appearance of random structures , thus is the mean - field signature for the glass transition .",

    ", quartic coupling dominates for short chains and the glass - transition lines are located above the spinodal ( or below the spinodal temperature ) ; for long chains , the opposite holds .",
    "we close this subsection with a brief discussion of the dynamics of the system .",
    "for the coulomb - frustrated - magnet model , by invoking the entropy - droplet picture , wolynes and co - workers predicted @xcite that the system should exhibit relaxations similar to fragile liquids @xcite , characterized by the vogel - fulcher behavior , with a relaxation time @xmath139 $ ] between @xmath140 and @xmath127 , and diverging at the kauzmann temperature @xmath6 .",
    "this prediction was disputed by geissler and reichman @xcite , who performed dynamic monte carlo simulations of the brazovskii model without the cubic interaction .",
    "they found that as the system approaches the glass - transition temperature predicted by the mode - coupling theory , the relaxation time indeed increases dramatically , but does not show characteristics of fragile liquids .",
    "schmalian , wu , and wolynes subsequently argued @xcite that the failure to find the expected dynamic behavior could be a result of the mode - coupling approximation which overestimates the transition temperature .",
    "here we note that the simulations by geissler _",
    "_ were performed at temperatures above the odt temperature , but our calculations show that in the absence of the cubic interaction , the onset of glassiness always occurs below the odt temperature , at least in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "therefore simulations at lower temperatures ( below the odt temperature ) are necessary in order to elucidate the dynamic behavior of this model .    for block - copolymer melts ,",
    "the situation is even more complicated .",
    "the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.2 ] ) is a coarse - grained description of the system that focuses on the physics at length scales comparable to or larger than the size of the polymer .",
    "therefore we expect the validity of our analysis to be limited to this range of length scales .",
    "the configurational entropy @xmath77 defined above only measures the number of configurations of chain aggregrates in the locally phase - separated structures , but does not account for different chain conformations within each aggregrate . indeed ,",
    "above the glass - transition temperature of the _ monomer _ , polymer chains remain liquidlike even though the system acquires solidlike behavior at the microstructural scale ( at high frequencies ) .",
    "chain diffusion also provides an additional mechanism for relaxations .",
    "therefore , to accurately describe the dynamic relaxations in block - copolymer melts , one has to consider relaxations both at the microstructural scale and of individual chains .",
    "our analysis in the previous subsection shows that the glass transition is possible in diblock - copolymer melts and is related to the underlying mean - field spinodal of the disordered phase , which is responsible for the proliferation of inhomogeneous metastable states .",
    "however , the odt also occurs in the neighborhood of the spinodal .",
    "thus a full understanding of the glass transition in this system must address the relationship between these two transitions .    in molecular liquids",
    "the glass transition always takes place in the supercooled state  below the melting ( freezing ) temperature .",
    "however , in diblock - copolymer melts , the structural entities forming the random structures are themselves molecular aggregates formed through self - assembly , the number and size of which depend on the temperature of the system .",
    "therefore the relationship between the glass transition and the odt is not obvious .",
    "microphase transitions in block - copolymer systems have been extensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in previous theories",
    "only the hartree term arising from the quartic interaction was retained ; fluctuations due to the cubic interaction were ignored .",
    "however , our analysis in the previous subsection shows that fluctuations due to the cubic interaction play an essential role in the glass transitions in asymmetric diblock copolymers , at least for long chains .",
    "moreover , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2.b ] , the leading cubic diagram is of the same order in @xmath0 as the hartree term and their numerical magnitudes are comparable . therefore we need to include fluctuations due to the cubic term in our studies to have a consistent comparison between the odt and the glass transition .    in this subsection , we compare the transitions into the ordered phase and into the glassy state .",
    "we have chosen to study symmetric ( @xmath141 ) and highly asymmetric @xmath142 copolymers , as our perturbative methods are better controlled in these two limits ( dominated by the quartic and cubic nonlinear interactions , respectively ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the chain length dependence of the transitions for symmetric copolymers ; it can be considered as a generalized phase diagram .",
    "the solid line delineates the equilibrium phase boundary between the disordered phase and the ordered lam phase . for a given @xmath0 , as temperature decreases [ @xmath143 increases ] , the equilibrium state of the system will change from the disordered phase through a weakly first - order transition to the lam phase .",
    "however , since the nucleation kinetics is generally slow and complicated @xcite , if the system is supercooled to avoid the nucleation of lam phase , the system will remain in a metastable disordered state below the odt temperature . upon further cooling to the temperature @xmath5",
    "shown as the dash - dotted line , the system enters the glassy regime .",
    "the region bounded by this line and the kauzmann line ( the dashed line ) defines the dynamic range within which glass transition can take place @xcite .",
    "although the lam phase has the lowest free energy at low temperatures , once a system is supercooled below @xmath6 , it becomes essentially frozen and incapable of reaching the more stable lam state .",
    "the narrow gap between the onset of glassiness and the kauzmann temperature implies that the glass transition in block copolymer melts will be fairly sharp .    in symmetric",
    "copolymer melts we observe the scaling of @xmath144 as predicted in ref .",
    "for the onset of glassiness , @xmath133 scales as @xmath135 , which agrees well with our approximate scaling analysis given in appendix [ appendix : b ] .",
    "our results show that for symmetric copolymers , the odt always occurs before the glass transitions ( i.e. , at temperatures above the glass transitions ) .",
    "while one might argue that this conclusion could be due to the particular choice of diagrams in our perturbative calculation , we find that this scaling with @xmath0 remains unchanged when a different approximation scheme , the self - consistent - screening approximation , is used .",
    "in addition , our results are also consistent with the local - field calculations by wu _",
    "et  al_.  @xcite , as will be discussed later in this subsection . since @xmath145 decays more rapidly with @xmath0 than both @xmath133 and @xmath134 , for sufficiently large @xmath0 , we always have @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , at least in the long - chain limit , our conclusion that the glass transition occurs below the odt temperature should be valid , regardless of the approximations in the calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows various transitions for highly asymmetric copolymers around @xmath147 . here",
    "again @xmath5 is not shown as it is very close to @xmath6 on the scale of the figures . in the case of @xmath148",
    ", the glass - transition lines are located below the odt , i.e. , the glass transition temperatures are above the odt temperature . in other words ,",
    "glass transitions can precede the ordering transition into the bcc phase .",
    "this unusual behavior is quite different from what happens in molecular fluids , where the glass transition always occurs below the freezing ( ordering ) temperature . in the case of longer chains with @xmath149 ,",
    "the odt occurs before the glass transitions ; this is the expected behavior in the asymptotic limit @xmath41 , since in this limit the glass - transition lines approach the mean - field spinodal whereas the odt into the bcc phase takes place at a finite distance below the spinodal @xcite .",
    "the chain - length dependence of the glass transitions relative to the odt for asymmetric diblock copolymers is qualitatively similar to the critical micelle temperature in the same system .",
    "it is shown @xcite that disordered micelles can appear in large numbers before the ordering transition only for not - too - long chains ; for very long chains , the odt will set in before the disordered micelles reach a considerable concentration , essentially precluding the disordered micelles from being a distinct intervening phase between the featureless disordered state and the ordered ( fcc or bcc ) phases .",
    "since micelles are likely to be the structural entities in the glassy asymmetric copolymer melts , the connection between the micelle formation and the glass transition is worth further investigation .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.a ] , the cubic interaction stabilizes the glassy state .",
    "we attribute this stabilizing effect to the additional complexities in the configurational space caused by the cubic term .",
    "this effect is closely related to the effect of the cubic interaction on the odt .",
    "theoretical analysis shows that the presence of the cubic term can considerably reduce the free energy of ordered microstructures with three fold symmetries .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there are more stable ordered phases in asymmetric diblock copolymers . if we visualize the random structures as polycrystals with local but no long - range order , then the increased variety of mesophase structures will increase the complexity in the configuration space , which can explain the stabilization of the glassy state in asymmetric copolymers .    as a final technical point",
    ", we compare our treatment of the cubic term with that in ref .",
    "there the authors used a local - field approximation , in which a momentum - independent self - energy is solved variationally by mapping the brazovskii hamiltonian [ as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.11 ] ) ] to a reference nonlinear but local hamiltonian . within this approximation",
    ", it was found that the cubic interaction considerably stabilizes the glassy state and the glass transition can occur at temperatures above the mean - field spinodal temperature ; these results coincide with ours .",
    "however , for certain choices of parameters in the weak - coupling regime , this local - field treatment could result in a nonmonotonic relation between the correlation length and the temperature .",
    "we believe this unphysical behavior is probably due to overestimating the fluctuation effects due to the cubic term in their treatment .",
    "to conclude , using the thermodynamic replica formalism we have shown that at low temperatures , diblock - copolymer melts can exist as randomly microphase - separated structures , in addition to the thermodynamically stable periodic structures .",
    "this transition is essentially a glass transition in which the supercooled liquid gradually gets vitrified .",
    "we have identified the temperature range over which this glass transition can occur , which is bordered by the onset of glassiness ( or the dynamic glass transition ) temperature from above and the kauzmann ( thermodynamic glass transition ) temperature from below . for symmetric diblock copolymers ,",
    "the glass transition takes place below the temperature of the odt into the lam phase .",
    "however , for asymmetric diblock copolymers , the glass transition can precede the ordering transition , which is an unusual feature that probably reflects the self - assembly nature of the system .",
    "this study leads us to naturally identify the quenched samples of block copolymers in some previous experimental works as the glassy state of the system . given the slow phase transition kinetics in copolymer systems , we expect such glassy structures to be quite common in these systems without externally imposed aligning fields .    as in any theories on polymer mixtures",
    "@xcite , the scaled degree of polymerization , @xmath0 , serves as a ginzburg parameter which allows us to systematically examine the approach to mean - field behavior as @xmath150 .",
    "an important conclusion is that in the limit of infinitely long chains , the glass transitions collapse to the mean - field spinodal , suggesting that the mean - field spinodal is ultimately responsible for the proliferation of inhomogeneous free - energy minima and can be used as the mean - field signature for the glass transition .    that a glass transition occurs at the mean - field spinodal in the limit of @xmath151",
    "can also be understood using the following dynamical argument .",
    "since the hamiltonian has an overall factor of @xmath152 , in the mean - field approximation , we expect the free energy barriers between the metastable states to be proportional to this factor .",
    "for very long chains , these barriers can be very large .",
    "since proliferation of the metastable minima appears at the spinodal @xcite , upon a quench below the spinodal , the system will first go to these metastable states with overwhelming probability because of their large number , and transitions from these metastable states should be very slow .",
    "note that it is the barriers from these metastable states to the ( more stable ) ordered phases and between the metastable states themselves , rather than the nucleation barrier from the uniform disordered phase to the ordered phases , that are relevant to the glass transition .",
    "hence , for example , in symmetric diblock copolymers , even though the transition from the disordered to lamellar phase approaches second order in the limit @xmath153 ( where the nucleation barrier vanishes @xcite ) , our theory predicts a glass transition that coincides with the odt , which is the spinodal in this limit .",
    "studying diblock - copolymer melt as a specific example of the brazovskii model , we find that the cubic interaction significantly increases the stability of the glassy state as well as the bcc phase , and causes qualitative changes in the scaling relations with the chain length .",
    "we conjecture that this stabilizing effect is due to increased configurational complexity as a result of more free - energy minima due to the presence of the cubic term .",
