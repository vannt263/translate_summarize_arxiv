    "the emergence of cost  effective microfluidic devices allowing manipulation and control of fluids on micrometer scales has promised a significant new paradigm for the manufacturing industry  @xcite .",
    "known as _ bottom  up _ processing , the required material can be transported to its destination in solvent form and deposited onto the target substrate using established technologies such as ink  jet head fluid ejection .",
    "one constraint of this means of material transport is that the deposited solution will evaporate , inducing non  trivial solvent flow that may distribute the solute in an irregular and undesirable manner . understanding the physical mechanisms underlying such phenomena are thus crucial to obtaining the desired deposit profile .    of concern here",
    "is the formation of a glassy ` crust ' that can appear on the liquid ",
    "vapour interface of evaporation polymer  @xcite or colloid  @xcite solutions .",
    "such crusts are believed to produce roughened surface profiles after drying of thin films  @xcite . for sessile ( _ i.e. _ pinned contact line ) droplets on a wetting substrate ,",
    "the effect is compounded by the outward radial flow of solvent during evaporation which , for low  concentration solutions , leads to enhanced solute deposition near the pinned line  @xcite . for the higher concentrations where crust formation occurs ,",
    "this outward flow suggests that the thickness of the crust will vary non  uniformly over the surface of the droplet , being thicker near the outer contact line and thinner near the centre or apex .",
    "being elastic , such a crust will deform under the internal osmotic pressure generated by continued solvent evaporation through its porous surface , and thus the final deposited polymer profile will at least partly depend on the mechanical properties of the crust .",
    "assuming it to be everywhere thin , the relevant area of elasticity required is shell theory , an established field with known results for many different geometries , including the spherical caps relevant here ( the droplet surface is spherical , so the initial crust profile should be approximately so ) ; see _ e.g. _ shilkrut  @xcite for a recent survey . however , most of the literature is for shells of uniform thickness  @xcite or specific , engineered non  uniformities  @xcite ; those with a thickness profile similar to that expected for evaporating droplets have not been investigated .",
    "furthermore , the rich array of deformed shell profiles observed in experiments  @xcite has not , to the best of our knowledge , been systematically quantified as a function of the shell parameters , even for uniform shells .    in this paper",
    "we describe numerical and theoretical investigations into the deformation of closed , elastic spherical caps with a thickness profile expected of crust formation during droplet evaporation , namely thin near the apex and thicker near the contact line .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to axisymmetric deformations that preserve the axis of symmetry of the shell ; asymmetric deformations , as sometimes seen in experiments  @xcite , will be the subject of a future study .",
    "an overview of the problem is given in fig .",
    "[ f : schematic](a ) . here , two schematic equilibrium curves of inward pressure @xmath0 and change in droplet volume @xmath1 are given , one monotonic and one non ",
    "monotonic ( here and below we define @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be positive for the deformations of interest ) .",
    "the s  shaped non  monotonic curve exhibits a buckling instability at a value  @xmath2 , when the shell jumps to an approximately inverted shape with a boundary layer .",
    "this is known as _",
    "snap  through _ , or simply _ snap _ buckling , and can also be realised by _ e.g. _ applying a localised load  @xcite or long  range attractive force  @xcite .",
    "if the pressure is subsequently decreased , a lower critical pressure is reached when the shell jumps to the original solution branch .",
    "this instability is known as _ snap ",
    "back _ buckling .",
    "the two differing critical pressures gives a hysteresis curve , the integrated area of which corresponds to the combined energy dissipated during both dynamic buckling events as the shell is damped to the static , equilibrium curve .",

    "the turning points of the profile are indicated by arrows.,width=321 ]    the above discussion assumes the pressure @xmath0 is being controlled .",
    "in fact , for the evaporation problem it is more natural to consider a slowly varying  @xmath1 , which may exhibit different limit points ; indeed , the simple schematic curves given in the figure are always stable under controlled volume .",
    "nonetheless we shall here control  @xmath0 , and focus much of our attention on the snap  through buckling point .",
    "the principle reason for doing this is that we are most interested in the deformation of the shell once non  linear effects have first become established , and the snap buckling point is a convenient point to focus on . indeed , as shown below , the mode of the shell remains essentially unaltered from when non  linear effects first become significant to the buckling point itself , so we are effectively probing a broad range of the @xmath3 curve .",
    "furthermore , controlling @xmath0 permits a closer correspondence with the spherical cap literature , for which a controlled volume is not typically considered .",
    "it also avoids the need for more sophisticated ( and time  consuming ) incremental  iterative algorithms  @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [",
    "s : model ] the model and simulation method are described .",
    "results are then presented in section  [ s : results ] , where it is shown that data for @xmath2 as a function of the undeformed shell geometry can be made to collapse onto a single curve when scaled accordingly .",
    "the same scaled parameters also determine the shape of the shell , as quantified by the ` mode number ' @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : schematic](b ) for some examples ) . by parameterising shells of non  uniform thickness in a convenient way , we show that the effect of non  uniformity is to distort these master curves , without altering the gross underlying behaviour .",
    "this is supported by the scaling analysis of section  [ s : scaling ] .",
    "finally , we return to the droplet evaporation problem in light of our findings in section  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "to focus on the behaviour of elastic shells of non  uniform thickness , we shall here reduce the complex process of crust formation into a simple , idealised form .",
    "in particular , modulation of the liquid  vapour interface during crust formation , crust thickening after its initial genesis , and the possibility of temporally  evolving intrinsic curvature are all ignored .",
    "in essence we assume that the all of the polymer rapidly gels at the surface of the droplet , and is initially in a stress  free state . since liquid droplets of size less than a few @xmath5 have spherical surfaces  @xcite , our initial , undeformed shell configuration is taken to be a spherical cap with radius of curvature @xmath6 and a contact angle ( the angle the shell makes with the substrate ) @xmath7 .",
    "this curved undeformed state identifies the crust as a _",
    ", distinct from a plate which is flat when not deformed  .",
    "the static configuration of a thin shell can be purely defined in terms of the geometry of the mid - plane surface @xmath8 and a ( possibly variable ) thickness @xmath9 , defined such that the outer and inner surfaces lie at distances @xmath10 normal to  @xmath8 . as we are only concerned here with quasi ",
    "static deformations , it suffices to find shell configurations that minimise @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the elastic strain energy and @xmath13 is the work done by the pressure  @xmath0 ( in our sign notation ) .",

    ", @xmath18 is the young s modulus of the material , and @xmath19 its poisson ratio .",
    "in addition , there is a bending energy term    @xmath20    where @xmath21 the _ change _ in curvature of the shell meridian from the undeformed value @xmath22",
    "terms proportional to @xmath23 or @xmath24 vanish for axisymmetric deformations and have been dropped .",
    "the expressions ( [ e : u_stretch ] ) and ( [ e : u_bend ] ) allow for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the thickness @xmath9 to vary over the surface .",
    "we shall here only consider variations in thickness that respect the axis of symmetry of the shell , _",

    "the apex thickness vanishes in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "equilibrium configurations @xmath8 for given shell parameters and pressure were found by numerically minimising the total energy using the bfgs variable metric method  @xcite .",
    "this was performed on the displacement vector fields @xmath35 ( radial displacement ) and @xmath36 ( angular displacement ) , where the @xmath37 range was discretised into 50100 segments as the situation dictated .",
    "the midplane strain tensor @xmath15 was found by evaluating the full , ( geometrically ) non  linear expression @xmath38 in spherical coordinates  . for simplicity ,",
    "only the linear expressions for @xmath21  @xcite were used , since intuitively it is non  linearity in the in  plane strains that controls buckling .",
    "the severity of this simplification was checked by comparing simulation data to known results for spherical caps ( _ i.e. _ the buckling pressure @xmath2 for uniform",
    "@xmath9  @xcite ) , for which the agreement was good .",
    "the results presented below are for a poisson ratio @xmath39 and clamped boundary conditions , in which the angle the shell makes with the contact line is fixed . for robustness",
    ", we have also simulated a representative sample of systems with @xmath40 ( incompressible ) , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and found no qualitative change in the results , merely a modulation of the master curves ( discussed below ) amounting to no more than 10% , although inspection of the shell equations ( [ e : u_stretch]-[e : u_bend ] ) suggests values of @xmath19 close to @xmath43 might produce more significant deviations . for",
    "hinged ( _ i.e. _ no angle constraint ) boundary conditions the effect was larger , reducing @xmath44 ( again , see below ) by @xmath45 , and similar sized changes in the critical pressure .",
    "furthermore the master curves for non  uniform shells were primarily shifted in pressure , only weakly in  @xmath46 .",
    "considerations of the microscopic nature of the crust  substrate interaction suggest clamped boundaries to be more realistic , and so we focus our attention on these .",
    "for small pressures  @xmath0 , the shell displacements are linear in @xmath0 and the elastic strain energy is simply proportional to  @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore the shape of the shell always takes the lowest mode consistent with the boundary conditions , namely the @xmath48 ` dimple ' form .",
    "higher modes only arise when the non  linear terms in the membrane strain become important .",

    "now observe that if the deformed shell takes the shape of an _ inverted _ spherical surface with the same radius of curvature  @xmath6 , the midplane strains @xmath15 , and hence @xmath58 , vanish . in between this inverted shape and the undeformed non - inverted shape lay flatter configurations with a high @xmath58 , which collectively play the role of an energy barrier between the two preferred states .",

    "buckles_.    in contrast to the stretching energy , the bending energy @xmath57 increases monotonically , even when the shell becomes inverted .",
    "hence as @xmath30 increases and @xmath57 becomes more significant , the depth of the energy well corresponding to the inverted shape becomes smaller , until at some point it vanishes .",
    "when this happens , there is no buckling and the shell continuously and smoothly deforms for slowly varying  @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath3 curve is monotonic ) . thus it should be possible to identify some dimensionless combination of parameters , including @xmath30 , that determines whether or not the shell buckles",

    "although this correctly predicts an initially linear decrease in @xmath2 with @xmath76 , it is clear from the simulations that the slope depends on the shell parameters rather than taking the fixed value @xmath146 as suggested here .    repeating the procedure for @xmath141 and expanding in @xmath147 reveals a more drastic modification from the uniform case . now",
    "@xmath148 and @xmath149 , so a small region around the apex becomes strongly deformed .",
    "the small exponent of @xmath150 , however , suggests @xmath76 must be very close to @xmath151 for this regime to be clearly observed .",
    "the critical pressure vanishes as @xmath152 with @xmath153 , whereas the simulations instead suggest @xmath154 as already described , again demonstrating this argument is at best capable of producing qualitatively correct predictions only .",
    "it is , however , not clear at this time how to improve the theory with regards non  uniform shells while retaining the appealing clarity of the scaling approach .",
    "the findings outlined in this article demonstrate that the effects of non  uniform shell thickness on the deformation and buckling of elastic caps can be handled in a systematic manner , once the mean shell thickness @xmath30 has been factored out of the thickness profile  @xmath26 . for the quadratic profile considered here ,",
    "the dimensionless non  uniformity parameter @xmath76 was shown to determine the behaviour of the system , in that each @xmath76 corresponded to a different master curve once the various quantities have been normalised in a suitable manner .",
    "based on this finding , we hypothesise that _ any _ non  uniform thickness profile @xmath155 will produce similar behaviour , with master curves parameterised by @xmath156 . the overall form of the curve , such as kinks corresponding to changes in the mode , is also expected to remain the same , with only quantitative details differing .",
    "the issue then becomes one of determining the actual thickness profile generated by droplet evaporation of sessile polymer or colloid solutions .",
    "this is far from trivial ; crust formation involves a number of physical processes  @xcite , including vapour diffusion , solvent flow and gelation , any and all of which may overlap in time with the elastic deformation considered in isolation here . until such a time that these effects are properly quantified for the droplet geometry , it is difficult to provide any definite predictions .",
    "nonetheless some broad statements can be made based on our findings .",
    "for instance , we expect that shells that are thinner near the apex than the base will generally have a lower mode number @xmath4 that uniform shells of the same mean thickness .",
    "this , perhaps ironically , suggests that , if a uniform deposit profile is required , it may be advantageous to have a _",
    "non  uniform _ thickness , since lower mode numbers @xmath4 correspond to flatter final shapes .",
    "also such shells are _",
    "weaker _ , in that the critical pressure is lower , suggesting they will reach non  linear region of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve comparatively quickly . notwithstanding the difficulties associated with the full evaporating droplet problem",
    ", it may be worthwhile to briefly speculate here on the effects of ongoing crust formation during deformation .",
    "supposing that polymer is added to the crust in an initially unstressed state , the effects of continued gelation will be to reduce the mean shell stress , and alter the intrinsic curvature towards the current value . given that the selection of higher modes requires non  linear deformations from some ( unstressed ) reference configuration , we speculate that the mode number @xmath4 will be _ reduced _ by this effect .",
    "however , this assumes the increase in crust thickness to be uniform . in reality",
    ", it is expected that the rate of deposition of new material to the shell will be higher for regions that are convex relative to the solution ( that is , that ` bulge ' into it ) than for concave regions , since convex regions will be exposed to a greater volume of solution and thus solute .",
    "this suggests a two  way coupling between deformation and crust thickening , a potentially rich problem for which further study would be desirable .    when comparing our work to the experiments of pauchard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , gorand _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and kajiya _ at al . _",
    "@xcite , a difference in notation should be observed : in these works the term ` instability ' is used to refer to the formation of any mode @xmath157 , whereas we reserve the term for snap  buckling events ( also symmetry  breaking deformations ) . from our findings , modes with @xmath157 ( such as mexican hats ) form when the characteristic deformation is of the order of the thickness of the shell , and thus will be delayed with respect to the formation of the crust itself . nonetheless the sequence of deformed shapes with increasing @xmath7 observed in  @xcite appears to be consistent with our work , although without any theory for the formation of the crust , it is difficult to provide any close correspondence with experiments .",
    "for instance , no @xmath158 mode has been observed in experiments ; this may be due to the emergence of asymmetric modes ( which for uniform shells are known to occur by @xmath159  @xcite , _ before _ the emergence of even the @xmath53 ` crater ' mode ) , due to dynamic effects , or more simply that the required shell parameters are outside of the experimental parameter window .",
