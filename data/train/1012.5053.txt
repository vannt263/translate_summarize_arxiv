    "hassler whitney introduced matroids in 1935 and gave two major examples of matroids , the cycle matroid of a graph and a matroid defined by a finite collection of vectors in a vector space .",
    "matroids have since found many applications in other parts of mathematics , including , in particular , topology where the matroidal properties of a hyperplane arrangement are very closely related to the topological properties of the arrangement ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the matroids associated to graphs are intimately related to its topology    we consider graphs on surfaces .",

    "when @xmath1 is a sphere , @xmath4 is isomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "thus the difference between isomorphism classes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be considered as a measure of non - planarity of the embedding and should reflect the topology of the pair @xmath6 .",
    "various combinatorial parameters of the matroids @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be assembled into the las vergnas polynomial of a matroid perspective @xmath7 introduced in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the topological parameters of the embedding of @xmath0 into @xmath1 can be assembled into the krushkal polynomial introduced in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the las vergnas polynomial is a specialization of the krushkal polynomial . in the process",
    ", we relate many combinatorial parameters of the matroids @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the topological parameters of the embedding .    in section [ s : lv ] we briefly review matroids and their combinatorial parameters , and introduce the las vergnas polynomial .",

    "the main theorem is formulated in section [ s : th ] , wherein we also obtain the duality property of the las vergnas polynomial as a consequence of our main theorem .",
    "we begin to prove the main theorem in section [ s : th ] and finish in section [ s : mct ] which consists of three lemmas relating the topological parameters of the embedding @xmath8 with the combinatorial parameters of its matroids .",
    "we conclude in section [ s : kp - br ] with a discussion on the relation of the krushkal polynomial with the bollobs - riordan polynomial of ribbon graphs .",

    "the second example is a finite set of vectors in a vector space",
    ". we may think about them as column vectors of a matrix .",
    "the rank function is the dimension of the subspace spanned by the subset of vectors , or the rank of the corresponding submatrix .",
    "this example generalizes the first one when the matrix ( over @xmath23 ) is the incidence matrix of @xmath0 , i.e. the matrix of the simplicial boundary map from the set of edges of @xmath0 to the set of vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "a subset @xmath11 is called _ independent _ if @xmath24 . in the first example , the independent subsets are those subsets of edges which do not contain cycles . in the second , independent subsets correspond to linearly independent subsets of vectors .",
    "a _ base _ of a matroid is a maximal independent set .",
    "a subset @xmath11 is called a _ circuit _ if @xmath25 . in the first example , this new notion of a circuit and the traditional notion of a circuit in a graph match . in the second example ,",

    "but the number of edges in a spanning forest of @xmath0 is equal to the number of vertices minus the number of components .",

    "krushkal wrote that @xmath140 and @xmath141 carry equivalent information .",
    "however this is not the case as the contraction / deletion properties for @xmath140 and for @xmath141 are not quite the same .",
    "the problem arises when deletion of an edge of a ribbon graph changes its genus .",
    "the genus might decrease by 1 with removal of an edge .",
    "for example , if we delete a loop @xmath142 from the ribbon graph @xmath133 corresponding to @xmath0 from example [ ex1 ] , then the resulting graph with a single loop will have genus zero .",
    "so , while in the bollobs - riordan approach it is considered as a graph embedded into a sphere , in the krushkal approach it is still embedded into the torus .",
    "we can not apply the substitution to that graph since its embedding on the torus is no longer cellular .",
