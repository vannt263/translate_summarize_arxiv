    "at high energies the total cross section for the reaction of a hadronic projectile with a nucleus of mass number @xmath1 is usually smaller than @xmath1 times the nucleonic cross section .",
    "this phenomenon , called the shadowing effect , can be understood if the mean free path of the projectile inside the nucleus is smaller than the nuclear dimension . in that case",
    "the nucleons on the front side of the nucleus shadow the downstream nucleons which therefore do not contribute to the total nuclear cross section . since the nucleonic cross section of photons is smaller than typical hadronic ones by a factor @xmath2 in order of magnitude",
    "it is at first sight astonishing that photonuclear reactions are shadowed at high energies . a qualitative explanation for the shadowing of high energy photons is given by their property to fluctuate into a hadronic state with the quantum numbers of the photon .",
    "this happens with a probability of order @xmath2 .",
    "the distance that such a hadronic fluctuation travels , the so called coherence length , can be estimated from the uncertainty principle : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the momentum of the photon , @xmath5 its energy and @xmath6 the mass of the hadronic fluctuation ( @xmath7 for real photons ) . if the coherence length becomes larger than the mean free path of the hadronic fluctuation inside the nucleus its total nuclear cross section and therefore also that of the photon is shadowed .",

    "gets two contributions to this amplitude ( see fig  [ fig : glauber ] ) .",
    "the first one stems from forward scattering of the photon from a single nucleon inside the nucleus .",
    "taking only this contribution into account leads to an unshadowed nuclear cross section .",
    "its interference with the second amplitude in order @xmath2 causes the shadowing effect . assuming that at high energies all scattering events are dominated in the forward direction ( eikonal approximation ) this second amplitude takes the following form : the incoming photon produces an intermediate hadronic state @xmath8 at one nucleon without exciting the nucleus . within the eikonal approximation this process",
    "is presumed to happen in the forward direction so that the hadronic state must have the quantum numbers of the photon .",
    "one therefore usually expects that these states are dominated by vector mesons .",
    "the intermediate hadronic state then scatters at fixed impact parameter through the nucleus and finally at some nucleon into the outgoing photon .",
    "one assumes that during the whole process the nucleus stays in its ground state and neglects processes with intermediate excitation of the nucleus .",
    "this so called multiple scattering approximation corresponds roughly to neglecting two body and higher nuclear correlations and is expected to be reasonable for high energies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "+ within the glauber approach one can quantitatively understand nuclear shadowing of high energy photons ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , but recent photoabsorption data @xcite on c , al , cu , sn and pb in the energy range from 1 to 2.6  gev display an early onset of the shadowing effect which some of the newer models @xcite can not explain . in @xcite we showed that one can understand the data within the simple glauber model by taking the negative real part of the @xmath9 scattering amplitude into account .",
    "however , some of the assumptions that are made in this simple model , like the validity of the eikonal approximation and the neglect of the finite width of the @xmath0 meson become questionable at low energies . in the present work we therefore use a multiple scattering approach  @xcite that we consider as more reliable in the shadowing onset region . within this approach",
    "one can account for the vacuum self - energy of the @xmath0 and include scattering processes in nonforward direction .",
    "we find that the latter allow for a new contribution to nuclear shadowing in photoabsorption at low energies , namely the production of @xmath10 as intermediate hadronic states .",
