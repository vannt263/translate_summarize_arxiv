    "the gravitational lens system 2016 + 112 , discovered by lawrence et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , has defied any simple explanation .",
    "the system consists of two agn images ( a and b ) at a redshift of @xmath0=3.273 ( lawrence et al .",
    "1984 ; schneider et al . 1985 , 1986 ) , separated by 3.4 arcsec . early optical and near - infrared observations ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "1985 ; langston , fischer & aspin 1991 ; lawrence , neugebauer & matthews 1993 ) showed the presence of two extended objects ( designated c@xmath3 and d ) .",
    "c@xmath3 lies some 2 arcsec south - east of image b , such that abc@xmath3 nearly form a right triangle .",
    "object d , the primary lens galaxy , has a redshift of 1.01 ( schneider et al .",
    "1985 ) and is close to the centroid of a , b and c@xmath3 .",
    "the redshift of c@xmath3 has resisted measurement .",
    "narrow ly-@xmath4 emission near a , b and c@xmath3 has been detected at a redshift of @xmath0=3.273 with line widths @xmath51000  kms@xmath6 ( schneider et al .",
    "1986 , 1987 ; lawrence 1996 ; yamada et al . 2001 ; lawrence et al .",
    "similarly , two fuzzy patches of ly-@xmath4 emission were detected about 3 arcsec north - west and west of images a and b , respectively ( schneider et al .",
    "1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "recently , high - resolution _ f814w_band ( lawrence et al . 2001 ) and _ f160w_band observations were obtained with the hst ( see the castles webpage http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/glensdata/mg2016.html ; e.g. muoz et al . 1998 ) , showing that images a and b are unresolved and compact , whereas c@xmath3 is arc - like and does not show obvious compact structure",
    ".    at radio wavelengths , 2016 + 112 has been observed with the vla ( e.g. lawrence et al . 1984 ; schneider et al .",
    "1985 ) and displays three components , a , b and c. all components contain compact substructure in higher resolution merlin ( garrett et al .",
    "1994 ) , vlbi ( heflin et al . 1991 ) and evn ( garrett et al . 1996 ) images . whereas components a and b consist of at least two subcomponents ( oriented approximately north - west ) , radio component c splits into four dominant subcomponents aligned east - west ( e.g. garrett et al .",
    "1996 ) . components a and b have steep integrated radio spectra between 18 cm and 6 cm ( lawrence et al .",
    "1994 ) , whereas component c has a somewhat flatter integrated radio spectrum .",
    "all component spectra steepen between 6 and 2 cm ( langston et al .",
    "the overall integrated spectrum of the lens system is that of a gps source and peaks somewhere in the range of 1 to 5 ghz . with the vla in a - array ,",
    "the source is barely detectable at 22  ghz ( patnaik , private communication ) .",
    "observations with evn at 18 cm and merlin at 6 cm ( garrett et al . 1996 ) show that the outermost images ( c@xmath7 and c@xmath8 ) have significantly steeper spectra than the two innermost components ( c@xmath9 and c@xmath10 ) .",
    "these observations suggest that the structures c@xmath7+c@xmath9 and c@xmath10+c@xmath11 have opposite parities and are probably images of the same structure in the source .",
    "observations of the field around 2016 + 112 with the _ asca satellite x - ray observatory _ suggested the presence of diffuse x - ray emission centered on the lens system and to the north - west ( hattori et al .",
    "1997 ; benitez et al .",
    "recent observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    ", however , unambiguously show that this emission is mostly due to discrete sources and not diffuse cluster emission ( chartas et al .",
    "in addition , the lensed images a and b , and complex c@xmath3 , are detected .",
    "the presence of x - ray and narrow emission lines suggests that the source could in fact be a type  ii quasar ( e.g. yamada et al .",
    "2001 ; chartas et al . 2001 ) .",
    "none of the other x - ray sources in the field are associated with galaxies detected by soucail et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see below ) . the comparatively large number of x - ray sources in the field of 2016 + 112 might be the result of a magnification bias , which enhances the number count of sources around the lensing mass distribution if the number density of x - ray source increases steeply at redshifts larger than that of the lens galaxy .",
    "spectroscopic observations by soucail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show the presence of an overdensity of galaxies at the same redshift as lens galaxy  d. similarly , clowe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) detect a 3@xmath12 weak - lensing signal to the north - west of the lens system , roughly coincident with the region of excess x - ray emission ( e.g. benitez et al .",
    "the latter could again be due to a magnification bias .",
    "only a marginal weak - lensing signal at the position of the lens system was found , consistent with the absence of a very massive dark x - ray cluster . if the dispersion in velocities of the field galaxies , found by soucail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , are representative of a virialized system , one would have expected to see diffuse x - ray emission ( chartas et al .",
    "absence of the latter therefore also suport that these galaxies have not yet virialized and formed a massive centrally concentrated cluster .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain these observations .",
    "some employ a single deflector and a single - screen ( langston et al .",
    "1991 ; benitez et al .",
    "1999 ) , whereas others used more complex models with c@xmath3 and d being different galaxies ( narashima et al . 1987 ) . in the proposed two - screen models",
    "it is assumed that object c@xmath3 is a galaxy at a redshift different from galaxy d , and responsible for lensing radio complex c into additional ` subimages ' ( nair 1993 ; nair & garrett 1997 ) .",
    "the mirror - symmetry and opposite parities for the structures c@xmath7+c@xmath9 and c@xmath10+c@xmath11 suggest that the source structure corresponding to complex c is quadruply imaged and that there is no need to invoke a second lens screen , that is not a weakly perturbative , but changes the nesting of the caustic curves in the sources plane . however , a two - screen model or a model that has two lens galaxies in the same lens plane , predicting the same parities as a single - screen single - lens model ( nair & garrett 1997 ) can of course not be excluded based on this argument alone .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative model that can quantitatively explain these observations with a single screen . instead of explaining the lens system with a complex deflector model , we find it can also be explained by a realistic , although more complex source model . in sect.2 , we present evn 5ghz radio observations of 2016 + 112 , which suggest that complex c consists of two images with opposite parities . in sect.3 , a detailed structure of the source is proposed which qualitatively can explain most of the observed features of the 2016 + 112 lens system . in sect.4 , we present a model of the lens potential that incorporates mass structures from the field around the lens system . in sect.5",
    ", we compare the model to the observational constraints to find that it can also quantitatively explain the available observational constraints of the lens system and the field . in sect.6 ,",
    "our results are summarized and discussed . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat smooth friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with @xmath13=0.3 and h@xmath14=65  kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the 5ghz evn observations were made on 1718 may 1995 from ut 22h30 to 10h30 , using 7 antennas of the evn : the 100-m effelsberg ( de ) , 26-m jodrell - mk2 ( uk ) , 25-m onsala ( se ) , 32-m medicina ( it ) , 32-m noto ( it ) , 32-m cambridge ( uk ) , and westerbork - array ( nl ) .",
    "technical problems resulted in no data from the latter two antennas .",
    "the recording mode was mkiiia mode a ( 56mhz bandwidth , left hand circular polarisation ) .",
    "a phase - reference observing scheme was used , switching between the target , 2016 + 112 , and a compact calibrator , j2029 + 121 , located 1 degree away .",
    "the tape ran continuously through each 13 minute pass , and the source switching cycle consisted of alternating between 90 seconds on the calibrator and 140 seconds on the target .",
    "correlation of the data was conducted at the mpifr mkiiia correlator in bonn . to prevent loss of data during correlator synchronisation of the very short scans ,",
    "each baseline was correlated twice as a continuous tape pass , once at each of the two source positions .",
    "( spurious correlations on the `` wrong '' source were edited out in the later data analysis ) .",
    "subsequent data processing and analysis was performed with the nrao  aips package .",
    "long fringe - fitting solutions were made that included several switching phases of the calibrator ; the resulting phase , delay and rate solutions were then applied to 2016 + 112 .",
    "although the interferometer model used in the mpifr correlator was not sufficiently accurate to permit direct phase - referencing , this process did remove short - term phase fluctuations , and allowed longer solution intervals to be used for self - calibration of the phases of the 2016 + 112 visibilities .",
    "amplitude calibration was made by initially assuming that j2029 + 121 is a 0.91jy point source on all baselines , and then determining self - calibration corrections after mapping the source .",
    "these amplitude and phase corrections were also applied to 2016 + 112 . in order to prevent fringe - rate and delay smearing over the 4 arcsecond field of view ,",
    "the data associated with 2016 + 112 were maintained as 28 contiguous 2  mhz channels with a visibility averaging time of 2.5 seconds .",
    "the calibrated 2016 + 112 data were fourier transformed and a naturally weighted , tapered image of the full field was produced .",
    "all three main regions of emission a , b and c were clearly detected and the image was used as an input model for subsequent ( phase - only ) self - calibration . since 2016 + 112 is a rather faint , resolved radio source , improvements to the original phase solutions were only obtained by employing a relatively long solution interval ( 13 minutes ) over the entire frequency band ( 56 mhz ) . cleaned maps of the three main regions of emission are presented in fig.1 .",
    "all the maps are naturally weighted ( the rms noise level is @xmath2140@xmath1jy beam@xmath6 ) and the fwhm of the circular restoring beam is 6  mas .    to obtain the positions and flux - densities of the radio components in regions a , b and c",
    ", elliptical gaussians were fitted to the images .",
    "images a and b were fitted by two gaussians .",
    "images c@xmath9 and c@xmath10 could not be fitted by single elliptical gaussians and were therefore each fitted by two gaussians ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "the results of these fits are listed in table  1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we note the remarkably high magnification ( @xmath1@xmath2300 ) at the brightness peaks ( i.e. not integrated over the image ) of images c@xmath9 and c@xmath10 , although the precise value is sensitive to the details of the model input ( see also below ) . for example , the magnification changes by about @xmath210% when changing the slope of the radial mass profile by @xmath25% .",
    "even so , this is the highest ( inferred ) magnification for any known lens system . because it is primarily directed tangentially and",
    "the jet direction is nearly perpendicular to the fold caustic , according to the model , any relativistic motion in the radio jet structure will be enhanced by a factor @xmath2@xmath1 .",
    "superluminal velocities of say @xmath23@xmath17 ( e.g. vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) could therefore lead to _ hyperluminal _ velocities of @xmath210@xmath18 .",
    "similarly , one can probe structure on intrinsic scales of a few micro - arcsecond when observed with vlbi . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lensed structure is part of the counter - jet ( see sect.3 ) , such high velocities are no longer expected ( even though velocities of @xmath19 for the counter - jet are still likely and could lead to _ hyperluminal _ velocities of @xmath20 ) . the absence of strong variability in the source ( haarsma et al .",
    "2001 ) and its gps - type radio spectrum might , however , be indicative of the absence of strongly relativistic motion .",
    "one problem that we have not yet addressed is the considerable difference in angular distance between the pair components c@xmath7c@xmath9 and c@xmath10c@xmath11 , which we did not include in the lens model . given the high magnification and symmetry around the critical curve",
    ", one would expect these distances to be similar .",
    "the fact that they are not seems to argue against our model and in favor of a two lens model ( nair & garrett 1997 ) .",
    "however , magnifications and the magnification matrix are a function of differences in higher - order derivatives of the local lens potential ( see schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) . especially in regions of very high magnification , many of these derivatives are very close to zero , because in those cases the lensed images form at very shallow extrema of the time - delay surface ( e.g. blandford & hogg 1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore not inconceivable that even a miniscule perturbation of the local lens potential ( e.g. by a globular cluster , halo substructure , etc ) will have an enormous effect on the local magnification matrix , i.e. on the image magnifications and the image positions .",
    "these discrepancies near critical curves have been seen in other lens systems with very high image magnifications ( mao & schneider 1998 ) and might not be uncommon in general . as an example , if we include a typical globular cluster with a velocity dispersion @xmath12=7kms@xmath6 ( einstein radius of @xmath51  mas ) about 5  mas away from image c@xmath8 , it changes the magnifications of c@xmath8 and c@xmath7 considerably , but also projects them on the same position in the source plane .",
    "the magnification ratio between c@xmath9 and c@xmath10 remains equal to unity within a few percent .",
    "the probability of such minor perturbations is considerable , especially because one expects hundreds if not thousands of globular clusters , dwarf satellites , etc . around these massive elliptical galaxies . at higher",
    "redshift , according to cosmological cdm models , the amount of halo substructure could be even more prevalent .",
    "we are therefore not too worried about this apparent discrepancy , but are warned that even though the magnifications in complex c are very high , their precise values are quite uncertain and should only be taken as indicative .",
    "we have shown that 2016 + 112 can be explained by a _ single - screen _ mass model .",
    "the observational constraints are reasonably well reproduced by the proposed model .",
    "the axial ratio of the surface md of the lens galaxy  d is somewhat larger than the axial ratio of its sb distribution , as determined from hst nicmos _ f160w_band observations .",
    "also its mass - to - light ratio is in good agreement with that of other lens galaxies .",
    "surprisingly , our model is consistent with the presence of a massive component about 1@xmath3 north ",
    "west of the lens galaxy , suggested from a weak - lensing analysis of the field ( clowe et al .",
    "we find evidence for an external shear that might result from a ` filamentary structure ' of high - redshift galaxies running across the lens system roughly from east to west ( see soucail et al .",
    "this filament is not a dynamically related structure , because it contains galaxies over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "the massive dark cluster previously suggested can not be confirmed or excluded , based on the strong - lensing constraints .",
    "in particular , a single @xmath21 galaxy several arcsec east of galaxy d ( see fig.3 ) could also be consistent with the strong lensing constraints .",
    "a faint object at that approximate position does appear on a deep r  band image , i.e. fig.4 in clowe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , although we do not know whether that object is indeed a galaxy and what redshift is has ( i.e. whether it forms a second lens screen ) .",
    "given the high redshift of the source , a perturbing galaxy at that position could have a wide range of redshifts ( 0.51.5 ) , not necessarily being that of the primary lens galaxy .    because we can explain the available data on 2016 + 112 with a single - screen model , we conclude that a second screen is at most only a pertrubation and that the optical / ir object c@xmath3 is a highly magnified arc of the agn host galaxy at @xmath0=3.273 .",
    "thus , we predict that optical spectroscopy of complex c@xmath3 will not yield a redshift in between that of lens galaxy d and the source as previously suspected , but will instead _ only _ show features at the source redshift .",
    "our model predicts a very high magnification ( @xmath1@xmath2300 ) at the brightness peaks of images c@xmath9 and c@xmath10 . this can be expected based on the proximity of these images ( only @xmath220mas ;",
    "see fig.1 ) to the critical curve passing in between them . because , the magnification is inversely proportional to the separation between the two images ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "1992 , chapt.6 ) , the small separation ( @xmath240mas ) between the images results in an order of magnitude higher magnification than normally observed .",
    "this is enhanced by the small angle between the line joining the images and the caustic , resulting in an even smaller distance of the images to the caustic ( i.e. a higher magnification ) . a magnification that is 12 orders of magnitude larger than normally seen for two merging images ( @xmath1@xmath210 ) ,",
    "can therefore be expected .",
    "this magnification could lead to observable _ hyperluminal _ motion with velocities of order @xmath2@xmath22@xmath17 of micro - arsec - scale structure in the lensed jet , although the gps - type radio spectrum and low variability of the source at present do not support the notion of high apparent velocities in the radio jet , especially also because our model suggests that it is the counter - jet that is being magnified .",
    "our source model appears to be that of a type  ii quasar ( e.g. yamada et al .",
    "2001 ; chartas et al . 2001 ) . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "only the counter - jet of the source is quadruply imaged , whereas the agn core and radio jet are doubly imaged .",
    "the host galaxy and the extended narrow - line emission around the core is part doubly and part quadruply imaged , which explains its offset from the optical and radio structures and also the difference in line ratios between images a & b and complex  c ( yamada et al . 2001 ) . the absence of blr emission and the presence of x - ray emission ( chartas et al .",
    "2001 ) further support the identification of this source as a type  ii quasar .    finally , we suggest that the two patches of ly@xmath4 emission found by schneider et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1987 ) could be cold gas clouds in the igm  possibly around some nearby galaxies  that are illuminated by the emission cone coming from the agn along the jet axes .",
    "there are indeed several objects at the positions of these patches ( soucail et al .",
    "2001 ; clowe et al .",
    "2001 ) , of which the brightest has the same redshift as the source ( soucail et al .",
    "when projecting the two patches on the source plane ( fig.3 ) , using the mass model presented in this paper , we find that one lies close to the ( counter ) jet axis in the source plane , i.e. @xmath220@xmath23 , whereas the second patch makes an angle of @xmath250@xmath23 .",
    "their distances to the agn in the source plane are 1.9 and 1.5 arcsec , respectively .",
    "they are therefore not multiply imaged .",
    "if the jet is pointed towards ( or away from ) the observer , the real angles between the patch , agn and observer could be smaller .",
    "the low expected metalicity for such igm clouds could explain the presence of strong ly@xmath4 emission lines and the absence of strong metal lines , such as the civ lines seen near images a , b and c@xmath3 ( schneider et al .",
    "1987 ; lawrence 1996 ) .",
    "if these patches are indeed illuminated by the agn , we expect this ly@xmath4 emission to be highly polarized .",
    "polarimetry observations on a 10-m class telescope could confirm this .",
    "the ultimate test between the different one and two - lens models will be the measurement of the redshift of spectral ( emission and absorption ) lines from complex c@xmath3 , which can only be @xmath243.273 , according to the model proposed in this paper .",
