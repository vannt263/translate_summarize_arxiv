    "using ensembles of random matrices to model the statistical properties of a family of @xmath0-functions has led to a wealth of interesting conjectures and results in number theory . in this paper",
    "we survey recent results in the hopes of conveying our best current answers to these questions :    1 .   what is a family of @xmath0-functions ?",
    "2 .   how do we model a family of @xmath0-functions ?",
    "what properties of the family can the model predict ?",
    "[ q : properties ]    in the remainder of this section we briefly review some commonly studied families and describe some of the properties which have been modeled using ideas from random matrix theory . in section  [ sec :",
    "family ] we provide a definition of `` family of @xmath0-functions '' which has been successful in permitting precise conjectures , and we briefly describe how to model such a family . in section  [ sec : ec ] we discuss families of elliptic curve @xmath0-functions and show that there is an additional subtlety which requires us to slightly broaden the class of random matrix models we use . then in section  [ sec : refined ] we discuss how to go beyond the leading - order terms which random matrix theory can model , and how one can avoid using random matrix theory when modeling a family of @xmath0-functions .",
    "if you only care about elliptic curves and their @xmath0-functions you can safely skip to section  [ sec : ec ] .",
    "i thank brian conrey , nina snaith , matt young , and steven j.  miller for many helpful conversations .",
    "the idea that collectively the zeros of a single @xmath0-function behave in a manner that can be modeled statistically started with montgomery s  @xcite work on the pair correlation of zeros of the zeta - function .",
    "combined with the large - scale numerical calculations of odlyzko  @xcite , this provided convincing evidence that , to leading order , the local statistics of the zeros of the zeta - function , suitably rescaled , were the same as those of large random unitary matrices .",
    "a similar collective behavior was noted long ago and is termed the `` @xmath1-analogue '' for dirichlet @xmath0-functions .",
    "that is , results about all dirichlet @xmath0-functions @xmath2 look just like results for the riemann @xmath3-function in @xmath4-aspect . for example , the formulas for moments of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are identical but for replacing @xmath4 by  @xmath1 .",
    "another early example of collective behavior is the pair correlation of zeros of quadratic dirichlet @xmath0-functions  @xcite .",
    "clearly something interesting is going on .",
    "the idea of a family of @xmath0-functions with an associated symmetry type began with the work of katz and sarnak  @xcite .",
    "they consider families of function field @xmath0-functions , where in this case a `` family '' of @xmath0-functions is the set of @xmath0-functions associated to a set of curves having certain properties . here",
    "the collection of curves must be `` natural '' in the sense that the monodromy group of the family ties it all together .",
    "they show that to leading order the statistics of the ( normalized ) zeros of these @xmath0-functions , when averaged over the family , are the same as the statistics of the ( normalized ) eigenvalues of random matrices chosen from a classical compact group . here",
    "the matrices are chosen uniformly with respect to haar measure , and the size of the matrices scales with the conductor of the @xmath0-function .    for global @xmath0-functions",
    "there does not ( yet ? ) exist an analogue of `` monodromy '' , but it still has been found that to naturally occurring families one can associate a classical group of matrices .",
    "the zeros of the @xmath0-functions have , to leading order , the same statistics as the eigenvalues of a randomly chosen matrix from the group . and the appropriately rescaled critical values of the @xmath0-functions have , to leading order , the same distribution as the `` critical values '' of the characteristic polynomials of the matrices from the group , chosen uniformly with respect to haar measure .",
    "the correspondence between the matrices and the @xmath0-functions involves equating the eigenvalue spacing with the zero spacing , or equivalently setting the matrix size equal to the conductor of the @xmath0-function .",
    "see section  [ ssec : modeling ] for more details .",
    "after the work of katz and sarnak there quickly appeared many examples of @xmath0-functions families behaving in a manner predicted by random matrix theory .",
    "some of the families considered were : @xmath0-functions associated to holomorphic cusp forms ( in either weight or level aspect ) ; dirichlet @xmath0-functions ( either all or quadratic ) ; and various twists or symmetric powers of @xmath0-functions .",
    "low - lying zeros were considered by iwaniec , luo , and sarnak  @xcite , rubinstein  @xcite , zlk and snyder  @xcite , and others .",
    "moments were considered by iwaniec and sarnak  @xcite , kowalski , michel , and vanderkam  @xcite , soundararajan  @xcite , and others .",
    "there is an important distinction between the predictions for zeros of @xmath0-functions and the predictions for moments . for the zeros there",
    "is a natural way to normalize : rescale so that the average spacing is  @xmath7 .",
    "this rescaling involves the conductor of the @xmath0-function and the degree of the characteristic polynomial , and this is the source of the principle that one chooses the size of the random matrix to equal the ( logarithm of the ) conductor of the @xmath0-function . with these normalizations",
    "one obtains accurate predictions for the leading - order behavior of statistics of zeros of @xmath0-functions .",
    "however , in addition to its zeros a polynomial is determined by an overall scale factor .",
    "so one may hope to use the characteristic polynomials to model the @xmath0-functions , but there will be a correction factor that does not come from random matrix theory .",
    "the use of the characteristic polynomial to model the @xmath0-function was begun by keating and snaith  @xcite .",
    "the first situation which was well understood is the moments of @xmath0-functions , for which there are explicit predictions for the arithmetic scale factor .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "there does not yet exist an adequate definition of `` family of @xmath0-functions '' . an attempt is made in  @xcite to define a family axiomatically , and we will describe that definition here . in that definition the axioms are chosen so that it is possible to produce a plausible conjecture for the critical moments of the family .",
    "complete details and many examples are in  @xcite , so we will just highlight the key features of that definition of a family .",
    "the main idea is that one starts with a fixed @xmath0-function and a family of `` characters '' , and the family of @xmath0-functions is produced by twisting the fixed @xmath0-function by the family of characters .",
    "note that here the term _ character _ is used to cover more general classes of functions than just dirichlet characters .",
    "we wish to define a `` family of @xmath0-functions '' , so first we have to give the definition we will use for `` @xmath0-function '' .",
    "the definition of an @xmath0-function which we give below is slightly different than what is known as the `` selberg class , '' but it is conjectured that the two are in fact equal .",
    "let @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath4 real .",
    "@xmath0-function _ is a dirichlet series @xmath10 with @xmath11 for every @xmath12 , which has three additional properties .    _",
    "analytic continuation : _",
    "@xmath13 continues to a meromorphic function of finite order with at most finitely many poles , and all poles are located on the @xmath14 line .",
    "_ functional equation : _ there is a number @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and a function @xmath17 of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a polynomial whose only zeros in @xmath22 are at the poles of @xmath13 , such that @xmath23 is entire , and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes the complex conjugate of  @xmath27 .",
    "the number @xmath28 is called the _ degree _ of the @xmath0-function .",
    "that number will also appear in the euler product .",
    "_ euler product : _ for @xmath29 we have @xmath30 where the product is over the primes  @xmath31 , and each @xmath32 equals  @xmath7 or  @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath34 is the only constant @xmath0-function , the set of @xmath0-functions is closed under products , and if @xmath13 is an @xmath0-function then so is @xmath35 for any real  @xmath36 .",
    "an @xmath0-function is called _ primitive _ if it can not be written as a nontrivial product of @xmath0-functions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume all @xmath0-functions are primitive , although we usually omit the word `` primitive . ''",
    "_ conductor : _ associated to an @xmath0-function is its _ conductor _ , a number which measures the `` size '' of the @xmath0-function .",
    "the paper  @xcite introduced a refined notion of conductor which , to leading order , is the logarithm of the usual notion of conductor . the refined conductor is necessary in order to have any hope of conjecturing the full main term in a general mean value of the @xmath0-function .",
    "write the functional equation in asymmetric form : @xmath37 where @xmath38",
    ". then the refined conductor of @xmath13 , denoted @xmath39 , is given by @xmath40 .      by a family of characters we mean a collection of arithmetic functions @xmath41 , where each @xmath42 is a sequence @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 whose",
    "generating function @xmath46 is a ( primitive ) @xmath0-function such that the collection @xmath47 has some nice properties . if we order the @xmath0-functions @xmath48 by conductor  @xmath49 , then the data @xmath50 in the functional equation of @xmath48 should be monotonic functions of the conductor , and the counting function @xmath51 should be nice .",
    "the final condition on the family of characters is the existence of an orthogonality relation among the @xmath42 .",
    "specifically , we require that if @xmath52 are integers then the average @xmath53 exist and be multiplicative .",
    "that is , if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 see section  3.1 of  @xcite for more details .",
    "now we create a family of @xmath0-functions by starting with a fixed @xmath0-function @xmath56 then the elements of our @xmath0-function family @xmath57 are the rankin - selberg convolutions @xmath58 ( there may be some issues with the local factors at the bad primes ) . note that if @xmath59 or @xmath60 then @xmath61 and in particular if @xmath62 is the riemann zeta - function , then @xmath63 .    the point of this definition of `` family ''",
    "is that the axioms provide the necessary ingredients to apply the recipe in  @xcite to conjecture the full main term in the shifted @xmath64th moment @xmath65 or more generally a shifted ratio  @xcite @xmath66 having such a mean value is sufficient to conjecture just about anything you would like to know about the zeros and the value distribution of the @xmath0-function .",
    "see  @xcite for examples .",
    "note that some families are unions of increasingly large pieces having the same conductor .",
    "examples are the dirichlet @xmath0-functions and the @xmath0-functions associated to holomorphic cusp forms ( in either weight or level aspect ) . for those families",
    "it is believed that the heuristics for moments will produce a reasonable conjecture for the average over a fixed ( large ) conductor .",
    "although this definition of `` family '' is useful for certain applications , it lacks the concreteness of the function field case . in particular",
    ", there does not yet exist an analogue of monodromy for such a family , and computing the symmetry type of the family is not straightforward .",
    "we discuss this in the next section .      given a family of @xmath0-functions",
    "one can ask questions about its value distribution or about the distribution of its zeros . in most cases current technology is not sufficient to answer the interesting questions , so the next hope is to find a plausible conjecture .",
    "only recently have such conjectures been found , and the new ingredient is to use random matrices to model the family of @xmath0-functions .    the idea is to associate a classical compact group , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , or @xmath71 , to the family .",
    "the local statistics of the eigenvalues should agree , to leading order , with the corresponding local statistics of the zeros of the @xmath0-functions . and ,",
    "to leading order and after compensating by an arithmetic constant , the value distribution of the characteristic polynomial @xmath72 near the point @xmath73 should agree with the value distribution of the @xmath0-functions near the critical point . here",
    "@xmath74 is an @xmath75 unitary matrix @xmath74 and @xmath76 is the hermitian conjugate of  @xmath74 , so the eigenvalues of @xmath74 lie on the unit circle and are denoted by  @xmath77 .    in the above correspondence the size of the matrix",
    "is set equal to the conductor of the @xmath0-function .",
    "( actually , to an integer close to the conductor , but to leading order such discrepancies do not matter ) . to see why this is a natural choice , consider the functional equation satisfied by the characteristic polynomial : @xmath78 if we identify @xmath79 with @xmath15 and @xmath80 with @xmath81 then we have a perfect correspondence between the functional equations of @xmath82 and @xmath13 , the unit circle playing the role of the critical line and @xmath73 the critical point .",
    "just as for @xmath0-functions , we define the conductor as @xmath83 evaluated at the critical point , so @xmath84 is the conductor .",
    "note that identifying conductors is equivalent to equating the average spacing between the zeros .",
    "values near the critical point are modeled using the correspondence @xmath85 .",
    "it remains to identify the matrix group which corresponds to the family . from the functional equation",
    "it is almost possible to determine the group : the only ambiguity is to distinguish between @xmath70 and @xmath68 . at one time",
    "it was thought that this case could be easily resolved because @xmath70 families always arise as `` half '' of a larger family , the other half being modeled by @xmath71 .",
    "on the other hand @xmath68 families do not have such a `` partner '' . a counterexample to that hope",
    "is described in  @xcite .",
    "but even if that approach were viable , it is unsatisfactory because it relies on the fact that the symmetry type can be found among a small list of possibilities .",
    "fortunately , there are other methods .",
    "one possibility is to compute the 1-  and 2-level densities of the family .",
    "this usually can be done rigorously for functions with small support , and this is sufficient to distinguish among the classical compact groups .",
    "but again we are relying on the fact that the symmetry type can be found on a short list .",
    "that objection can be overcome if one can conjecture the level densities in the full range , but that can be quite difficult in practice .",
    "another possibility is to use the recipe in  @xcite to conjecture the moments of the family .",
    "this unambiguously identifies the group , and it also can tell you if the family is not modeled by one of those groups .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear that the recipe in  @xcite can be applied to all interesting families of elliptic curve @xmath0-functions , such as the family  @xmath86 given in  .",
    "just to be pedantic , we note the following answers to the questions posed at the beginning of section  [ sec : intro ] :    1 .",
    "a family of @xmath0-functions is a set of @xmath0-functions , ordered by conductor , which is built in a particular way from a family of characters .",
    "the counting function of the family should be nice , and the data in the functional equation should be monotonic functions of the conductor .",
    "a family is modeled by associating to it a classical compact matrix group .",
    "the specific compact group can usually be determined by computing the level densities of the low - lying zeros of the family , or by conjecturing the moments of the family .",
    "the size of the matrices scales with the ( logarithmic ) conductor of the @xmath0-functions .",
    "3 .   to leading order",
    "the rescaled local zero statistics of the family are the same as the rescaled local eigenvalue statistics of the group . to leading order the critical moments of the family equal the critical moments of the characteristic polynomials , up to a multiplicative arithmetic constant . for the family",
    "we average over the @xmath0-functions of conductor less than  @xmath87 , and then let  @xmath88 . for the matrix groups the averages are with respect to haar measure .",
    "the modeling described above will produce leading order asymptotics . to make more precise predictions",
    "requires other methods , which are described in section  [ sec : refined ] .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , @xmath89 is an elliptic curve over @xmath90 , with root number @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the @xmath0-function associated to @xmath89 normalized so that @xmath93 is the critical point .",
    "if @xmath94 is any family of elliptic curves we write @xmath95 where @xmath96 or @xmath97 , respectively , are the curves @xmath98 with @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "we write @xmath101 for the curve @xmath102 .",
    "most of the information in this section can be found in recent papers by steven j.  miller and eduaro dueez  @xcite , nina snaith  @xcite and matthew young  @xcite . the author of this paper is just trying to convey the current understanding of the relationship between families of elliptic curve @xmath0-functions and random matrix theory : he makes no claim to any of the ideas presented here .",
    "the following question is not well posed :    _ what is the correct random matrix model for the @xmath0-functions of a family of elliptic curves having a prescribed rank  @xmath103 ?",
    "_    the question is not well posed because there are ( at least ) two reasonable models , both of which seem to be appropriate for certain families of elliptic curves .",
    "we will first examine the simplest case of rank  @xmath104 .",
    "consider the following families of rational elliptic curves : @xmath105 and @xmath106 note that the point @xmath107 on @xmath108 almost always has infinite order , so almost all of the curves in @xmath109 have rank at least  1 .",
    "let s consider @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "in both families we have @xmath112 because @xmath100 .",
    "however , for @xmath113 we could have said @xmath112 because @xmath114 .",
    "the fact that the zero at @xmath115 for @xmath116 was _ constructed _ , instead of just arising from parity considerations , has a profound influence on the behavior of the @xmath0-function near the critical point .    to understand the influence of the critical zero , we first consider the distribution of  @xmath117 , which assuming standard conjectures is nonzero for almost all curves in our @xmath100 families .",
    "we have the following conjectures from  @xcite : @xmath118 while @xmath119    as the formulas show , the behavior at the critical point is different for the two families , even though both families could be described as `` a rank 1 family of elliptic curves . '' in particular , we see that the derivative @xmath117 tends to be smaller for @xmath113 .",
    "this can be explained by the tendency for the low - lying zeros of @xmath92 to be closer to the critical point for  @xmath113 .",
    "that is , @xmath111 should have more low - lying zeros , which will cause the @xmath0-function to stay small near the critical point , and so its derivative will also be small .",
    "to make this idea precise we consider the 1-level density of the zeros .",
    "let @xmath120 denote the imaginary parts of the zeros of @xmath92 in the upper half of the critical strip .",
    "note that we have omitted the zero(s ) at the critical point .",
    "the _ one - level density _ of the family @xmath121 is defined to be the function @xmath122 which satisfies @xmath123 as @xmath88 , for nice functions  @xmath124 .",
    "that is , @xmath122 measures the density of the zeros of the family .",
    "the observation about the relative size of @xmath117 can be restated as : the one - level density for the family @xmath111 should be more concentrated near 0 than the one - level density for the family  @xmath110 . by using random matrix theory and some other ideas",
    "we explain below , it is possible to produce a precise conjecture for the one - level densities of these families .",
    "these are given in figure  [ fig : onelevel ] .",
    "the functions are rescaled so that the average spacing between zeros is  @xmath7 . in the next section",
    "we explain where those conjectures came from .",
    "[ fig : onelevel ]    [ 0.7]-function zeros of the family @xmath110 ( left ) and @xmath111 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ] 0.4 in [ 0.7]-function zeros of the family @xmath110 ( left ) and @xmath111 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ] +      the plots in figure  [ fig : onelevel ] are familiar .",
    "the plot on the left is the rescaled one - level density of the eigenvalues of matrices from the group @xmath71 , in the limit as @xmath125 .",
    "the plot on the right is the rescaled one - level density of the eigenvalues of matrices from the group @xmath70 , in the limit as @xmath125 .",
    "given those plot , what are our models for the two families ?",
    "consider the following ways to make a polynomial @xmath126 which has real coefficients , all its zeros on the unit circle , and ( almost surely a simple ) zero at @xmath73 :    * the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in @xmath71 * @xmath127 times the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in @xmath70    it should be clear that those two examples will have the one - level densities pictured in figure  [ fig : onelevel ] .",
    "these examples are the simplest cases of the two most commonly studied higher rank families of elliptic curve @xmath0-functions , which we now describe .",

    "we describe the two models which are believed to correspond to these families .",
    "the names for these models was coined by steven j.  miller .      _ the interaction model _",
    "we are modeling a family that arises by restricting a much larger family to a subfamily having at least  @xmath103 zeros at the critical point . a matrix model for this family",
    "can be described as follows : start with @xmath140 where @xmath141 or @xmath142 depending on whether we are modeling @xmath138 or @xmath139 , and restrict to those matrices having @xmath7 as an eigenvalue of multiplicity at least  @xmath103 .",
    "that is , you take matrices in @xmath140 and drag @xmath103 zeros to the critical point .",
    "there are some bad things about this model .",
    "first , it is a set of matrices , but it is not a group . and while it is a perfectly well - defined set , it is a measure zero subset of @xmath140 , so there is no canonical way to restrict haar measure to it .    one solution , which has been analyzed by snaith  @xcite and dueez  @xcite is to first restrict to those matrices which have @xmath103 eigenvalues in  @xmath143 $ ] , and then let  @xmath144 .",
    "the resulting measure is the same as one obtains by taking haar measure on @xmath140 , formally substituting  @xmath145 for @xmath103 of the eigenvalues , and then omitting those terms which vanish identically . with the eigenvalues given by @xmath146 ,",
    "the induced measure on that set is @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a normalization constant .",
    "it is instructive to look at the one - level density for such matrices .",
    "the one - level density is given by  @xcite @xmath149    [ fig : restrictonelevel ]    [ 0.9 ] , restricted to have exactly @xmath103 eigenvalues at  @xmath145 , for @xmath150.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    there is some numerical evidence  @xcite that this model is accurate .",
    "for this model it is possible to compute the critical moments of the characteristic polynomials  @xcite , but it does not seem that all the ingredients are available to use the recipe in  @xcite to conjecture the moments of the family .",
    "note that when @xmath151 we recover  @xmath70 and when @xmath104 we have @xmath71 .      _ the independent model _",
    "we are modeling a family that has an @xmath103th order zero at the origin which arises from an explicit construction . a model for this situation can be found by assuming that the extra critical zeros are just inserted at the critical point , and all the other zeros ignore them .",
    "that is , start with a matrix in @xmath140 where @xmath152 or @xmath153 depending on the parity of @xmath103 and the sign of  @xmath134 .",
    "then the polynomial which models the @xmath0-function is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix , multiplied by  @xmath154 .",
    "the one - level density only depends on the parity of @xmath103 and the sign of  @xmath134 , and will be one of the functions shown in figure  [ fig : onelevel ] .",
    "one can phrase the model strictly in terms of matrices by saying that the model is given by the group @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the @xmath157 identity matrix and @xmath152 or @xmath153 is chosen according to the parity of @xmath103 and the sign of the functional equation .",
    "there is numerical evidence  @xcite , level density calculations  @xcite and conjectures for moments  @xcite that this model gives accurate predictions for some specific families .",
    "it is worth repeating that the above models , even if they are correct , are only intended to capture leading - term asymptotics .",
    "computer experiments  @xcite find that the low lying zeros of the family  @xmath158 exhibit some anomalous behavior which presumably will disappear when larger examples are computed .",
    "it is entirely possible that family @xmath86 is a union of families of the form  @xmath158 , and this may contribute to a bias in those numerics . in families of type",
    "@xmath158 the generators of the set of rational points have very small height , and this may also introduce a bias .",
    "that is , the heights of the generators are on the order of the logarithm of the conductor , while it is more typical to have the heights as large as a power of the conductor .",
    "see silverman  @xcite , chapter 10 , for a discussion of heights of generators .",
    "it is possible that more accurate predictions of the one - level density ( using methods described in the next section ) will show better agreement with the data .",
    "those methods are also able to give extremely precise predictions for the moments of the @xmath0-functions  @xcite , and these give support to the models .",
    "it is not clear that these families of elliptic curves give rise to families of @xmath0-functions as described in section  [ sec : family ] .",
    "for the purpose of conjecturing the moments of the family ( which is why that definition of ` family ' was developed ) , the key property is the orthogonality relation  . for specific families of type  @xmath158 it should be possible to evaluate such sums .",
    "the result is likely to be quite complicated , as in  @xcite .",
    "a  subtle problem is that the parameter  @xmath87 in the elliptic curve families is approximately the discriminant , not the conductor . by szpiro s",
    "conjecture the logarithm of the discriminant is within a factor of 6 of the logarithm of the conductor , so it is possible that ordering by discriminant is almost as good as ordering by conductor .",
    "it seems reasonable to model by setting  @xmath84 , the size of the matrix , equal to @xmath159 , since what else would you choose ?",
    "if that choice is correct it suggests that @xmath87 is close to the discriminant most of the time .",
    "this has been shown for some families  @xcite .",
    "one can cook up an elliptic curve family which presumably is a hybrid of the models described here : take a rank @xmath103 family of type @xmath158 and restrict to those curves having rank at least @xmath160 . if one makes the reasonable assumption that the `` extra '' zeros created by this process do not interact with the original @xmath103 zeros imposed at the critical point , then one can use methods similar to  @xcite to predict how many curves are in the restricted family .",
    "i am not advocating a reckless proliferation of elliptic curve models , but merely noting that even if the two models described here are correct and can be refined to predict lower order terms , they may not cover all families of interest .    in figure",
    "[ fig : restrictonelevel ] one can see that if @xmath103 is large then you are unlikely to find noncritical zeros close to the critical point .",
    "the name `` repulsion '' has been given to this phenomenon .",
    "the logic behind the name is that the `` lowest zero '' is further from the critical point than it would be if there were not a multiple critical zero .",
    "unfortunately , the `` lowest zero '' is not a well defined object .",
    "if you drag the lowest zero to the critical point then the other zeros follow it toward the critical point , and at the moment you increase the order of the critical zero there becomes a new `` lowest zero '' .",
    "if there is an @xmath103th order critical zero and you count zeros correctly , then the `` lowest zero '' is actually the @xmath161st zero , and it is likely to be _ closer _ to the critical point than a typical @xmath161st zero . in other words ,",
    "the word `` attraction '' more accurately describes the situation ! there is no reason to change the current terminology , but keep in mind that in the model where one restricts to those matrices having multiple eigenvalues at  @xmath7 , the other eigenvalues have actually moved _ towards _ the critical point .",
    "random matrix theory is useful for making leading - order asymptotic predictions about families of @xmath0-function . to understand the finer behavior of the family one must use heuristic techniques from number theory .",
    "there are two main refinements to the leading term asymptotics .",
    "first , @xmath0-function families are ordered by conductor , and we use the conductor to determine the appropriate size matrices for our model .",
    "there will be a discrepancy between the limiting behavior for large matrices and the behavior for finite size matrices .",
    "for some quantities , such as the nearest neighbor spacing of the zeros / eigenvalues , it is difficult to see the difference between the asymptotics of the distribution and the distribution for moderate size matrices .",
    "for other quantities , such as the value distribution , for any computable range there is a notable difference between the limiting quantity and the values that can be computed .",
    "see keating and snaith  @xcite , for a spectacular example concerning the value distribution of @xmath162 . by a theorem of selberg that is gaussian in the limit @xmath163 , but for finite @xmath4 it differs from a gaussian in the same way as the characteristic polynomial of an appropriately sized random unitary matrix .",
    "the second issue is the fact that there are lower order terms , and the lower order terms for @xmath0-functions involve arithmetic factors , while the lower order terms of random matrices do not .",
    "thus , the general shape of expressions from random matrix theory can reveal what to expect for @xmath0-functions , but the arithmetic `` correction terms '' must be determined in some other manner . for zero spacings",
    "there are no arithmetic corrections in the leading order terms . for moments of @xmath0-functions",
    "the leading order correction terms are fairly straightforward to determine  @xcite .",
    "just about everything else is quite subtle and one needs sophisticated number - theoretic methods in order to make sensible conjectures .    for moments of @xmath0-functions",
    "such conjectures are covered in detail in  @xcite .",
    "matt young  @xcite used these heuristics to compute the full main term for various families of elliptic curve @xmath0-functions .",
    "those conjectures give   and as special cases .",
    "thus , the heuristics appear to correctly handle a variety of interesting families .",
    "( for the family @xmath86 in our current understanding of the distribution of the coefficients  @xmath164 does not seem adequate to conjecture the moments of the family . even finding the leading order arithmetic factor seems difficult in this case",
    ". however , random matrix calculations  @xcite predict the general shape of the moments . )    for quantities involving zero statistics , moments are insufficient and one needs averages of ratios of the @xmath0-functions .",
    "this is addressed in  @xcite .",
    "for example , the expected value of the ratio @xmath165 is sufficient to determine the one - level density of the family @xmath166 , including the lower order correction terms due to arithmetic effects .",
    "see  @xcite for many examples .",
    "it should be possible to use these methods to conjecture the ratio   for various higher rank elliptic curve families , and thus give a precise conjecture for the one - level density .",
    "as of this writing this has not been done , but probably it will have been done by the time this paper appears in print .    in summary , by choosing the matrix group and the size of the matrices appropriately , and with the appropriate arithmetic correction factor , a family of @xmath0-functions can be modeled by the characteristic polynomials of a collection of matrices .",
    "the example of elliptic curve @xmath0-functions where the elliptic curves are selected to have large rank shows that the collection of matrices may not be a group .",
    "in order to capture the lower order terms one must use heuristics from number theory which do not explicitly involve random matrix theory . those heuristics also recover the leading order behavior which previously required random matrix theory .",
