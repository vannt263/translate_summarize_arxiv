    "@xcite .",
    "however , and despite its success in determining a variety of solutions , this method depends on the chosen variables  and can thus present a hidden selection bias , by excluding other interesting regimes not represented with the adopted set .",
    "in addition , the existence of fixed points with the desired local stability does not imply that there is a trajectory in the phase space ( i.e. a history for the universe ) that connects these points , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite : ideally , the fixed points yielding the current phase of accelerated expansion should have a extremely wide basin of attraction ( or infinite , _ i.e. _ a global attractor ) , so that the matter dominance epoch evolves towards the former with no strong dependence on the initial conditions  thus excluding the need for unphysical fine - tuning .",
    "such endeavour , which is beyond the scope of this work , could also encompass an accurate numerical analysis of the field equations , in order to estimate reasonable physical parameters ( _ e.g. _ @xmath95 and @xmath92 for a power - law nmc ) compatible with current cosmographic results , and derive predictions for the future evolution of cosmological parameters .",
