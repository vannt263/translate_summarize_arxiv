    "the best fit isochrone must show the most adequate reproduction of fiducial line of the sequence ( mainly in its upper part ) and location of its three basic points : points of the turnoff and main sequence at the same level of the @xmath0 , and point of the extremum .",

    "( 1997 ) of ngc 6397 has been used to apply this approach .",
    "the densest part of the cluster field and stars above the turnoff level were excluded from consideration . since the most probable cluster metallicity ( see gratton et al .",
    "2000 ; castilho et al .",
    "2000 ) is close to @xmath1=-2.0 $ ] , the set of isochrones of appropriate metallicity was used .",
    "panels of fig . 1 show that the fitting criteria described above are best met by isochrone for 16 gyr age in each diagram presented .",
    "a fitting accuracy is of order @xmath2 gyr , taking into account that result of the best fit is approximately the same in all the diagrams .",
    "however , real error in age may be as large as a few gyr ( vandenberg 1999 , private communication ) even if a photometry is precise , with no systematic effects .",
    "that may be due to incertaincy in the parameters of theoretical calculations such as @xmath3 , or to the problems of transformation of isochrones to the colors used , etc .",
    "( e.g. , see , for details , grundahl et al .",
    "note that change of 0.1 dex in @xmath1 $ ] causes change in age estimate @xmath4 gyr so that say for @xmath1=-1.9 $ ] the age derived for ngc 6397 is @xmath5 gyr ."
