    "one of the interesting problems in statistical mechanics concerns the understanding of the origin of macroscopic dissipation and the approach to thermal equilibrium from microscopical point of view .",
    "conventionally , given a statistical system in the thermodynamic or hydrodynamic limit , we imagine the collisions between the microscopic constituents of our system as being responsible for both of these macroscopic phenomena .",
    "this kinetic theory based picture is firmly anchored on the basic idea of brownian motion  in 1827 , the botanist robert brown observed @xcite under a microscope that tiny pollen particles suspended in water undergo incessant irregular motion , which became known as the brownian motion . as is well - known now , this peculiar motion is due to collisions with the fluid particles in random thermal motion .",
    "therefore , any particle immersed in fluid at finite temperature exhibits such brownian motion , from a small pendulum suspended in a dilute gas @xcite to a heavy particle in quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this universal phenomenon suggests that the interaction with microscopic constituents is responsible for dissipation and thermalization on macroscopic scales .    since its advent",
    ", the holographic ads / cft correspondence @xcite has been exploited to study the physics of non - abelian quark - gluon plasmas at finite temperature from bulk gravitational physics , and _",
    "vice versa_. the dual gravitational description of strongly coupled gauge theories provides an efficient way to study the thermodynamic properties and the phase structure of the gauge theory .",
    "more recently , it has become clear that one can also exploit the gravitational description to understand the hydrodynamic regime of the quark - gluon plasma , as was originally proposed in @xcite and has been significantly developed afterwards ( see @xcite and references therein for earlier work on hydrodynamics in the ads / cft context ) .",
    "namely , the long - wavelength physics described by a hydrodynamical navier  stokes equation on the boundary side is holographically dual to the long - wavelength fluctuation of the horizons of asymptotically ads black hole spacetimes on the gravitational side .",
    "this correspondence allows for a detailed quantitative study of the plasma from the bulk , and _ vice versa .",
    "_ it is thus a natural question to ask whether one can obtain a holographic description of brownian motion , which is one step towards the microphysics underlying thermodynamics and hydrodynamics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "one intrinsic reason to be interested in brownian motion within a holographic setting is to better understand the microscopic origin of the thermodynamic properties of black holes .",
    "it has become clear from the formulation of the ads / cft correspondence that one has an in - principle solution to the problem of quantum dynamics of black holes : we only need to solve the problem phrased in terms of the dual field theory variables .",
    "however , it is fair to say that a concrete quantitative understanding of the physics in these contexts is still lacking .",
    "one of the most useful playgrounds for understanding the quantum behavior of black holes has been the arena of supersymmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "here we not only understand in many cases the microscopic origin of black hole entropy , but also in a number of cases have a bulk picture of the nature of the microscopic states making up the black hole degeneracy .",
    "in fact , from these various analyses , there emerges a rather intriguing picture of a quantum black hole  the black hole microstates form a sort of spacetime foam that replaces the region inside the horizon .",
    "any single microstate is horizon - free , but the typical microstates are expected to exhibit the characteristic features of black hole spacetimes , which has been confirmed explicitly for some concrete systems ; see @xcite for reviews . given this state of affairs one might probe these microstates beyond equilibrium thermodynamics and ask how the ensemble of them leads to dissipation and thermalization seen in a thermal medium . understanding the description of brownian motion seems then a natural step towards getting a handle on the problem .",
    "conversely , as mentioned above , the ads / cft correspondence has been immensely useful in understanding many qualitative ( and sometimes quantitative ) features of quark - gluon plasmas .",
    "the famous lower bound on the ratio of shear - viscosity to entropy density for relativistic hydrodynamic systems , @xmath0 @xcite ( see also a review @xcite ) , has certainly played an important role in obtaining a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of the quark - gluon plasma produced at rhic .",
    "furthermore , studies of the motion of quarks , mesons , and baryons in the quark - gluon plasma have been carried out in the holographic framework starting with the seminal papers @xcite , by considering the dynamics of probe strings and d - branes in asymptotically ads black hole spacetime  for a sample of recent reviews on the subject , see @xcite .",
    "the general philosophy in these discussions was to use the probe dynamics to extract the rates of energy loss and transverse momentum broadening in the medium , which bear direct relevance to the physical problem of motion of quarks and mesons in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "in such computations , the motion of an external quark in the quark - gluon plasma is assumed to be described by a relativistic langevin equation @xcite . in the most basic form",
    ", the langevin equation is parametrized by two constants : the friction ( drag force ) coefficient @xmath1 and the magnitude of the random force @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , in the relativistic case , the random force has different magnitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the directions transverse and longitudinal to the momentum @xmath5 . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath6",
    ", they are equal : @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 are related to each other by the einstein relation , under the assumption that the langevin dynamics holds and gives the jttner distribution @xmath8 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath4 is an independent parameter @xcite . ] furthermore , the random force is assumed to be white noise . by using the ads / cft realization of external quarks , refs.@xcite determined the friction coefficient @xmath1 , while refs .",
    "@xcite computed the random force @xmath2 . and @xcite computed @xmath4 , both in the relativistic case ( the computation of @xcite was nonrelativistic ) .",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath3 does not have to be computed independently , since it is related to @xmath1 by the einstein relation .",
    "see also footnote [ ftnt : rel_einst_rel ] . ]",
    "therefore , one can say that the most basic data of the langevin equation describing brownian motion in the cft plasma are already available .",
    "however , rather than taking such approaches which are phenomenological in some sense , one could study more fundamental aspects of brownian motion in the ads / cft context .",
    "for example , in the first place , why does an external quark exhibit brownian motion , and why is the motion described by a langevin equation ? while the domain of validity of the langevin equation is clear from the previous results on the drag force , can we identify the origins of the brownian motion approximation from the bulk gravitational description ? what is the bulk meaning of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem relating @xmath1 and @xmath2 ?",
    "the main purpose of the current paper is to elucidate the ads / cft physics of brownian motion , by addressing such questions . for example",
    ", the computation of the random force in @xcite using the gkpw prescription @xcite does not explain what the bulk counterpart of the random force is .",
    "we will see that it corresponds to a version of hawking radiation in the bulk .",
    "since we want to model brownian motion , we need a gravitational analog of a particle immersed in a thermal medium . in the boundary field theory a natural particle is a test quark of large but finite mass immersed in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this is realized in the dual gravitational picture by introducing a fundamental string in the schwarzschild - ads background .",
    "the endpoint of the string at the boundary then corresponds to the test quark which undergoes brownian motion ; see figure [ fig : brownianf1 ] .",
    "we will use this simple picture of a probe fundamental string in a black hole background to `` derive '' the brownian motion which the string endpoint on the boundary undergoes .",
    "the basic idea is to quantize the fluctuations of the string world - sheet about a classical solution , which in the situations of interest corresponds to a straight string hanging down from the boundary .",
    "since the bulk geometry has an event horizon , the induced metric on the string world - sheet also corresponds to a black hole geometry and the problem of studying fluctuations reduces to the dynamics of two dimensional quantum fields in curved spacetime . by quantizing the fluctuations we relate the quantum modes of the string to the boundary endpoint .",
    "this mapping in principle allows one to use the correlation functions of the position of the string endpoint on the boundary to recover the excitation spectrum of the string world - sheet .",
    "assuming the validity of the semiclassical approximation , we can then relate the thermal physics of the hawking radiation to the brownian motion of the string endpoint and derive the langevin equation for the boundary dynamics .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : setup ] , we set the stage for our discussion by first reviewing the langevin equation describing brownian motion in the field theory context .",
    "we then turn to a holographic realization of brownian motion in terms of the dynamics of a probe fundamental string stretching from the boundary to the horizon of an asymptotically ads black hole geometry in @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "we write down the explicit relation between the boundary and bulk quantities associated with the holographic brownian motion .",
    "this boundary - bulk relation can be explicitly worked out at the semiclassical level , which we turn to in section [ sec : semiclass ] , focussing on the simple case of three dimensional spacetimes . there",
    ", we assume that modes on the string are thermally excited due to hawking radiation and we derive the langevin dynamics exhibited by the boundary brownian particle .",
    "the friction and the random force appearing in the langevin equation are related to each other by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in section [ sec : fdthm ] , we study this theorem from the bulk viewpoint and give a bulk proof of it in the general case . in section [ sec : gen_dim ] , we generalize the discussion in section [ sec : semiclass ] for @xmath10 to general dimensions . despite being unable to quantize the modes on the string analytically in this case",
    "we nevertheless show that at small frequencies we recover the langevin equation . in section [ sec : bm_on_strtch_hor ] , we study whether the bulk brownian motion of the fundamental string can be interpreted as being caused by a suitable movement of the string endpoint on the horizon , the idea being that the endpoint is randomly excited by the stringy gas living on a membrane just outside the horizon , much as in the spirit of the membrane paradigm .",
    "we also provide a preliminary discussion of how to use our setup to study microscopic properties of the stretched horizon .",
    "ultimately , we would like to directly probe properties of the quasi - particles that make up the stringy gas living at the stretched horizon , but that is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "section [ sec : disc ] is devoted to a discussion .",
    "some of the relevant technical details are collected in the appendices .",
    "to set the stage for our discussion we begin with a brief review of the langevin dynamics that describes the brownian motion . this discussion will be the field theoretic , or boundary , side of the story in the ads / cft context . turning to the corresponding bulk description",
    ", we will then describe how one can set up the problem of studying the motion of a brownian particle in a thermal medium in terms of a probe string in an asymptotically schwarzschild - ads black hole background .",
    "let us begin with the langevin equation , which is the simplest model describing a non - relativistic brownian particle of mass @xmath11 in one spatial dimension : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ( non - relativistic ) momentum of the brownian particle at position @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the two terms on the right hand side of correspond to friction and a random force , respectively , and @xmath16 is a constant called the friction coefficient .",
    "one can think of the particle as losing energy to the medium due to the friction term and concurrently getting a random kick from the thermal bath modeled by the random force , which we assume to be white noise with the following average : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "the separation of the force into frictional and random parts on the right hand side of is merely a phenomenological simplification  microscopically , the two forces have the same origin ( collision with the fluid constituents ) .    assuming equipartition of energy , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the temperature , . ]",
    "one can derive the following time evolution for the displacement squared @xcite : @xmath21 ^ 2 }   = { 2\\,d\\over\\gamma_0}\\ ,",
    "\\left(\\gamma_0 \\,t-1+e^{-\\gamma_0 \\,t}\\right )   \\approx   \\begin{cases }    \\displaystyle { t\\over m}\\,t^2 & \\displaystyle \\bigl(t\\ll { 1\\over\\gamma_0}\\bigr ) \\\\[3ex ]    \\displaystyle 2\\,d\\,t            & \\displaystyle \\bigl(t\\gg { 1\\over\\gamma_0}\\bigr )   \\end{cases }   \\label{s^2_simple}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the diffusion constant @xmath22 is related to the friction coefficient @xmath16 by the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation , @xmath23 we can see that in the ballistic regime , @xmath24 , the particle moves inertially ( @xmath25 ) with the velocity determined by equipartition , @xmath26 , while in the diffusive regime , @xmath27 , the particle undergoes a random walk ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this is because the brownian particle must be hit by a certain number of fluid particles to get substantially diverted from the direction of its initial velocity .",
    "the crossover time between the two regimes is the relaxation time @xmath29 which characterizes the time scale for the brownian particle to forget its initial velocity and thermalize .",
    "one can also derive the relation between the friction coefficient @xmath16 and the size of the random force @xmath18 @xmath30 which is the simplest example of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and arises due to the fact that the frictional and random forces are of the same origin .",
    "in @xmath31 spatial dimensions , @xmath5 and @xmath32 in are generalized to @xmath31 component vectors and is generalized to @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the displacement squared goes as @xmath35 .",
    "the sutherland ",
    "einstein relation and the fluctuation - dissipation relation are independent of @xmath31 .",
    "now let us go back to the case with one spatial dimension ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the langevin equation , captures certain essential features of physics , but nevertheless is too simple , for two reasons .",
    "it assumes that the friction is instantaneous and that there is no correlation between random forces at different times ( eq .  ) .",
    "if the brownian particle is not infinitely more massive than the fluid particles , these assumptions are no longer valid ; friction will depend on the past history of the particle , and random forces at different times will not be fully independent .",
    "we can incorporate these effects by generalizing the simplest langevin equation to the so - called generalized langevin equation @xcite , @xmath37 now the friction term depends on the past trajectory via the memory kernel @xmath38 .",
    "the random force is taken to satisfy @xmath39 where @xmath40 is some function .",
    "we have also now introduced an external force @xmath41 that can be applied to the system .    to analyze the physical content of the generalized langevin equation we fourier transform to obtain @xmath42-i\\omega } ,   \\label{genle_omega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 are fourier transforms , _",

    "so , we can determine the admittance @xmath48 , and thereby @xmath45 $ ] , by measuring the response @xmath49 to an external force .",
    "in particular , if the external force is @xmath50 then @xmath51 is simply @xmath52    for a quantity @xmath53 , define the power spectrum @xmath54 by @xmath55 note that @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 in a stationary system .",
    "the knowledge of power spectrum is the same as that of 2-point function , because of the wiener ",

    "however , as we will discuss in section [ sec : fdthm ] , these two quantities are not independent but are related to each other by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which is the generalization of the relation .    for the generalized langevin equation ,",
    "what corresponds to the relaxation time is @xmath62^{-1 }   = { 1\\over \\gamma[\\omega=0]}=\\mu(\\omega=0 ) .",
    "\\label{t_relax_gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath38 is sharply peaked around @xmath63 , we can ignore the retarded effect of the friction term in and write @xmath64 then the langevin equation reduces to the simple langevin equation and it is clear that @xmath65 corresponds to the thermalization time for the brownian particle .    another physically relevant time scale , the microscopic ( or collision duration ) time @xmath66 , is defined to be the width of the random force correlator function @xmath40 .",
    "specifically , let us define @xmath67 if @xmath68 , the right hand side of this precisely gives @xmath66 .",
    "this @xmath66 characterizes the time scale over which the random force is correlated , and thus can be thought of as the time elapsed in a single process of scattering . in many cases , @xmath69 typical examples for which holds are the case where the particle is scattered occasionally by dilute scatterers , and the case where a heavy particle is hit frequently by much smaller particles @xcite .",
    "as we will see later , for the brownian motion dual to ads black holes , the field theories are strongly coupled cfts and does not necessarily hold .",
    "there is also a third natural time scale @xmath70 given by the typical time elapsed between two collisions . in the kinetic theory ,",
    "this mean free path time is typically @xmath71 ; however in the case of present interest , this separation no longer holds , as we will see .      the ads / cft correspondence states that string theory in ads@xmath72 is dual to a cft in @xmath73 dimensions .",

    "let us consider a fundamental string suspended from the boundary at @xmath79 , straight down along the @xmath80 direction , into the horizon at @xmath81 ; see figure [ fig : brownianf1 ] . in the boundary cft",
    ", this corresponds to having a very heavy external charged particle .",

    ", such an external particle at finite temperature @xmath20 is expected to undergo brownian motion .",
    "the dual statement must be that the black hole environment in the bulk excites the modes on the string and , as the result , the endpoint of the string at @xmath79 exhibits a brownian motion which can be modeled by a langevin equation .",
    "we study this motion of a string in the probe approximation where we ignore its backreaction on the background geometry .",
    "we assume that there is no @xmath83-field in the background , which is the case for ads@xmath84 based on d1- and d5-branes , and ads@xmath85 based on d3-branes .",
    "if we take the string coupling @xmath86 to be very small , the interaction of the string with the thermal gas of closed strings in the bulk of the ads space can be ignored ; the only possible region with appreciable interaction is near the black hole horizon which the string is dipping into .",
    "let us slightly generalize for a little while and consider the following metric : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for the spacetimes of interest , both @xmath90 and @xmath91 are independent of @xmath92 . when the transverse directions to the string @xmath92 are indeed killing directions in the bulk",
    "] now , we stretch a string along the @xmath80 direction and consider small fluctuation of it in the transverse directions @xmath92 .",

    "the quadratic approximation is of course valid as long as the scalars @xmath92 do not fluctuate too far from their equilibrium value ( taken here to be @xmath99 ) . , this quadratic approximation is valid outside the black hole except for the region within @xmath100 away from the horizon .",

    "therefore , we expect ( and will see ) that the dual langevin dynamics on the boundary will also be a non - relativistic one , which is precisely what we reviewed in the previous subsection . for most of the paper",

    "@xcite argued that one can derive the universality of this ratio using the membrane paradigm , _",
    "i.e. _ , the physics of the stretched horizon similar to the discussion given above .",
    "we have here focussed on the stochastic langevin process and derived the features of the membrane that reproduce the physics of strings impinging on the black hole .",
    "again we see that the diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks in the boundary agrees with that derived for the stretched horizon .",
    "in @xcite , susskind and collaborators put forward a provocative conjecture that a black hole is made of a fundamental string covering the entire horizon .",
    "although this picture must be somewhat modified @xcite since we now know that branes are essential ingredients of string theory , it is still an attractive idea that , in the near horizon region where the local temperature becomes string scale , a stringy `` soup '' or `` cloud '' of strings and branes is floating around , covering the entire horizon .",
    "if this picture is true , one naturally expects that it is this stringy cloud that is exerting frictional and stochastic forces on the ir endpoint of the fundamental string as described by ; see figure [ fig : clouds ] .",
    "can we learn anything about this stringy cloud ?",
    "the stretched horizon is located a distance @xmath397 away from the mathematical horizon @xcite .",
    "it is occupied by a string of length @xmath398 , with @xmath399 the entropy of the black hole .",
    "if we associate one degree of freedom to each string segment of length @xmath400 , the number of degrees of freedom equals the entropy , and one can try to think of these degrees of freedom in terms of free quasi - particles .",
    "the average separation between the quasi - particles is equal to [ avsep ] x ~ l_p(d ) with @xmath401 the @xmath9-dimensional planck length .",
    "if the quasi - particles move with the speed of light and @xmath402 represents the probability that quasi - particles will interact with the endpoint of the string , then we expect a mean free path time of the order of [ aux9 ] t_mfp ~x .",
    "supposing for a moment we assume that this is the same as the mean free path time on the boundary which , in appendix [ sec : t_mfp ] , we argued to be given by @xmath403 .",
    "combined with ( [ aux9 ] ) and ( [ avsep ] ) this leads to the interaction probability [ intprob ] ~ l_d(p ) which for the usual ads@xmath283 case leads to a scaling with @xmath86 and @xmath404 as @xmath405 .",
    "this is a rather peculiar prediction for the interaction strength of the string endpoint with the quasi - particles . since the quasi - particles are made out of strings ( or branes )",
    "some @xmath86 dependence is to be expected , and the interaction strength indeed vanishes as @xmath406 .",
    "in deriving we have assumed that the mean free path time on the stretched horizon is identical to that on the boundary .",
    "this however , is unlikely to pertain as we explain now .",
    "in fact , we will argue that on general grounds we should expect that @xmath407 on any stretched horizon .",
    "the logic relies on using dimensional analysis coupled with thermal physics of black holes .",
    "generically we expect , [ stmfp ] t_mfp = ( tl_s , l_p(d)l_s , l_s ) where @xmath408 is a function of the dimensionless ratios of the length scales available .",
    "we have fixed the overall normalization to be determined by the thermal scale on physical grounds .",
    "furthermore , using the facts that : ( i ) the dynamics of string probes generically are unaware of the planck scale ( to determine which we could for instance use d - brane probes @xcite ) and , ( ii ) the geometry near a black hole horizon is the rindler spacetime , which is insensitive to the cosmological constant , we can argue that @xmath409 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is independent of the hierarchy between the various length scales in the problem .",
    "more precisely , in the near horizon region , @xmath410 , the ads@xmath109 black hole metric reduces to the rindler metric : @xmath411 where @xmath412 because the metric does not contain any scale such as @xmath76 , the dynamics of a fundamental string in the near horizon region can only depend on @xmath400 ( dependence on @xmath401 is excluded as in ( i ) ) .",
    "therefore , the mean free path time @xmath413 determined from the dynamics of the string can only depend on @xmath400 .",
    "however , because @xmath413 is dimensionless , it should be that @xmath414 , which means @xmath415",
    ". one can give a more concrete argument by using the argument in appendix [ sec : t_mfp ] applied to the near - horizon geometry .    now using @xmath416",
    "we can conclude that the interaction probability only depends on the ratio of the @xmath9-dimensional planck scale and string scale : [ intprob2 ] ~  , which suggests a universal dynamics of the stretched horizon independent of the asymptotics of the spacetime",
    ". nevertheless leads to an interaction probability which is a non - trivial function of @xmath86 as @xmath401 depends non - trivially on the details of the compactification .",
    "away from the horizon , instead of @xmath400 . in this case with a stretched horizon located @xmath401 away from the horizon , we obtain a simpler result @xmath417 instead of .",
    "this simple form of @xmath402 is appealing , but we do not know of a physical reason to choose one over the other . ]    clearly , it would be interesting to explore this line of thought further and , for example , also find an interpretation for the collision time .",
    "however , many of the assumptions we made are highly questionable .",
    "for example , we ignored backreaction , and only used the quadratic part of the nambu ",
    "goto action .",
    "the latter approximation certainly breaks down once we are a proper distance @xmath418 away from the horizon .",
    "it is also unclear to what extent we can really think of the stretched horizon as a gas of almost free quasi - particles .",
    "we leave an exploration of these issues to future work .",
    "in this paper , we discussed brownian motion in the holographic context , in order to shed light on near - equilibrium dynamics of strongly coupled thermal gauge theories . a useful probe exhibiting brownian motion consists of a fundamental string stretching between the boundary and the horizon and being randomly excited by the black hole environment .",
    "we established the relation between the observables associated with such brownian particle in the boundary theory and those of the transverse mode excitations of the fundamental string . at the semiclassical level ,",
    "the modes on the string are thermally excited due to hawking radiation and , consequently , the motion of the boundary brownian particle is described by a langevin equation , which involves stochastic force and friction . in the bulk",
    ", the stochastic force corresponds to the random excitation of the string by the hawking radiation , while the friction corresponds to the fact that the excitations on the string get dissipated into the horizon .",
    "although in this paper we focused on the relation at the semiclassical level between the boundary brownian motion and the dynamics of the fundamental string in the bulk , the boundary - bulk dictionary we wrote down in subsection [ ss : bdybulk ] in principle allows one to predict the precise correlations of the hawking radiation quanta beyond the semiclassical approximation , in terms of the precise correlation functions for the boundary brownian particle . obtaining the latter",
    "of course requires one to compute correlation functions in strongly coupled plasmas , which is a difficult task .",
    "nevertheless , such a dictionary is an important step toward understanding the microphysics underlying the fluid - gravity correspondence .",
    "one of the particularly interesting results of the current paper is the estimate in subsection [ sec : holauto ] for the time scales associated with the brownian particle immersed in a cft plasma : @xmath419 note that setting @xmath420 in @xmath421 gives @xmath104 , which is a consistency check because a fluid particle can be thought of as a brownian particle with mass @xmath291 .",
    "the fact that @xmath422 at strong coupling @xmath288 implies that a brownian particle interacts with many plasma particles simultaneously . because of this , a brownian particle with mass @xmath423 can thermalize in a time much shorter than @xmath293 , the time elapsed in a single process of collision .",
    "this is reminiscent of the recent conjecture @xcite that black holes can scramble information very fast , whose dual picture is that a degree of freedom in the boundary theory interacts with a huge number of other degrees of freedom simultaneously",
    ". it would be interesting to study this possible connection further .",
    "historically , the main achievement of the theory of brownian motion was the determination of the value of the avogadro constant @xmath424 , which is huge but finite . if @xmath425 were infinite , the diffusion constant would be zero and we would not be able to observe brownian motion .",
    "the fact that we can observe it in nature gives evidence that @xmath425 is finite and fluids are not continuous but made of molecules .",
    "then , what is the analogue of the avogadro constant in the brownian motion in the ads / cft context we studied , and what is the bulk significance of it ? in the case of ads@xmath85/sym@xmath426 , the macroscopic energy density of the plasma scales as @xmath427 , while the energy carried by a microscopic quantum is of the order of the temperature @xmath428 .",
    "what corresponds to the avogadro constant is the ratio of these , @xmath429 . the finiteness of @xmath425 corresponds to the finiteness of @xmath404 . in the bulk , on the other hand , what corresponds to @xmath256 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath430 with @xmath431 the schwarzschild radius , while @xmath20 is the hawking temperature @xmath432 .",
    "the ratio is @xmath433 .",
    "so , in the bulk , the finiteness of @xmath425 corresponds to the finiteness of @xmath434 , or to the fact that the energy carried by a hawking radiation quantum is finite although it is much smaller than the mass of the black hole .",
    "we considered non - relativistic brownian motion in the current paper , which is the result of the quadratic approximation we made in to the nambu ",
    "goto action .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize our treatment to the relativistic case , where brownian motion and its langevin dynamics are not very well understood ; for a recent discussion , see _ e.g._@xcite .",
    "such a generalization can also be regarded as a generalization of the drag force computations of @xcite , which are relativistic because the full nambu ",
    "goto action was taken into account , to non - stationary ( @xmath435 ) solutions .",
    "also , with such a relativistic formalism , one can presumably give a more rigorous derivation of @xmath104 than the one we did in appendix [ sec : t_mfp ] .",
    "as explained above , the stochastic force appearing in the langevin equation is related to the friction term via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in the bulk",
    "the latter is mimicked by the dissipative nature of the event horizon , which is present for all black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "the stochastic term arises due to the hawking temperature of the black hole ; yet only non - extremal black holes have finite bekenstein  hawking temperature .",
    "this leads to the naive puzzle that whereas the dissipation is always present , fluctuation is seemingly absent for extremal black holes since these have zero temperature .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the quantum fluctuations which are present even at zero temperature suffice to account for the origin of the stochastic processes .",
    "note that this is not a - priori unreasonable in the ads / cft context ; although quantum processes are @xmath436 suppressed in the large @xmath404 field theory , we had to account for the semi - classical hawking radiation phenomena to see the origin of the random force in the langevin equation .",
    "furthermore , extremal black holes could also be subject to super - radiant type instabilities which can effectively mimic the physics of hawking radiation .",
    "in fact , this feature has been exploited recently to show how the microstate ` geometries ' can reproduce some features of the thermal hawking spectrum @xcite .    the stochastic random force which drives the long time diffusive motion has a characteristic dependence on the temperature , which we derived assuming that the system was thermodynamically stable . as is well known ,",
    "considering the global as opposed to the poincar patch of ads provides two distinct black hole solutions at the same temperature  the small black hole which has negative specific heat and a large black hole which is in thermal equilibrium with the hawking radiation . to be able to access both these solutions",
    "simultaneously one has to work in the global ads geometry which has a compact spatial boundary .",
    "the physics of a probe string endpoint in the small black hole background should exhibit marked differences from the brownian motion discussed above , despite the system experiencing the same temperature . in a finite volume system",
    "we naively expect the brownian process to saturate after the time scale @xmath437 , for in this time the particle has diffused throughout the system . in the bulk",
    "this presumably corresponds to the string diffusing out completely on the stretched horizon and becoming indistinguishable from the thermal atmosphere .",
    "this can in fact be used to probe the difference between the large and the small black hole .",
    "imagine we normalize the physics of the string endpoint on the boundary to correspond to the brownian motion undertaken in the large black hole . using this as the uv boundary condition for the probe string in the small black hole background",
    ", we can examine the dynamics of the endpoint at the ir stretched horizon .",
    "a plausible conjecture for this dynamics is that the fluctuations of the string are macroscopically large on the stretched horizon , in fact will have a scale comparable to the black hole itself .",
