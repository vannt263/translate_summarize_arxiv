    "due to their special optical properties and their controllability through electric and magnetic fields , liquid crystals have proven to be fundamental in many scientific and technological applications .",
    "their properties have been deeply investigated for over a century and nowadays increasing emphasis is being placed on so - called nematic shells .",
    "these are microscopic particles coated by a thin film of liquid crystals , which develop defects with a topological charge , and thus have a tendency to self - assemble into metamaterials which may have new optical properties and a high potential for technological applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the form of the elastic energy for nematics is well established , both in the framework of director theory , based on the works of oseen , zocher , and frank , and in the framework of the order - tensor theory introduced by de gennes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in contrast , there is no universal agreement on the _ two - dimensional _ free energy to model nematic shells",
    ". different ways to take into account the distorsion effect of the substrate were proposed in @xcite and recently by napoli and vergori ( @xcite ) . indeed , as observed in @xcite and @xcite , the liquid crystal ground state ( and all its stable configurations , in general ) is the result of the competition between two driving principles :",
    "on one hand the minimization of the  curvature of the texture \" penalized by the elastic energy , and on the other the frustration due to constraints of geometrical and topological nature , imposed by anchoring the nematic to the surface of the underlying particle . the new energy model ( @xcite ) affects these two aspects , focusing on the effects of the extrinsic geometry of the substrate on the elastic energy of the nematics .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the above - mentioned energies are deduced by means of heuristic considerations or ad hoc anstze .",
    "a rigorous justification , which could indicate which form of energy is preferable , is still missing .",
    "for instance , one could envision to model molecular interactions on a discrete lattice and derive a macroscopic surface energy via @xmath0-convergence , as it is done for the flat case in @xcite .    with the present paper we aim at exploring the full consequences of the new model so that a detailed comparison with the classical one can be established .",
    "more precisely , we study the two - dimensional napoli - vergori director theory for nematic shells on a genus one surface : _ a ) _ we analyze the dependence of the new energy on the mechanical parameters ( splay , twist and bend moduli ) and on the geometrical parameters ( the radii of the torus ) ; _ b ) _ we highlight in which cases the new energy acts as a _ selection principle _ among the minimizers of the classical one , and in which cases _ new _ different states emerge . finally , _",
    "c ) _ we predict the existence of stable equilibrium states carrying a higher energy than the ground state , in correspondence with the homotopy classes of the torus . our analysis , in particular , agrees and makes more precise the statement of @xcite , according to which the new energy  promotes the alignment of the flux lines of the nematic director towards geodesics and/ or lines of curvature of the surface \" .",
    "the aspect of high energy equilibrium states is present in the classical energy as well , but it was neglected in previous research on genus one surfaces ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations are based on a rigorous mathematical analysis of the models , which combines methods from differential geometry and topology , calculus of variations , functional analysis and numerical simulations .",
    "topology enters our work , first of all , in the choice of the torus as base substrate .",
    "indeed the nematics would necessarily present defects on any surface with genus different than one , due to poincar - hopf theorem ( @xcite ) ; as a consequence , when dealing with the frank s director theory , the space of functions in which one looks for minimizers would be empty , even in a weak sense ( see @xcite ) , requiring thus further expedients or approximations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea in @xcite relies on the extension of classical degree theory from continuous functions to the space of bounded mean oscillation functions , which , in particular , includes all the vector fields that have bounded frank - oseen energy @xcite .",
    "the emptiness of the set of minimizers of frank - oseen energy follows then from the emptiness of the set of continuous unit tangent vectors on surfaces with genus @xmath1 . in order to focus on the influence of the geometry ,",
    "we choose here a surface where defectless ground states can be found .",
    "the case of a cylinder , the simplest surface where different results between classical and new energy can be predicted , was presented in @xcite ( on a sphere , the two energies differ by a constant ) .",
    "a related energy on hyperbolic surfaces was studied in @xcite and in @xcite , which described the different effects of the intrinsic and of the extrinsic geometry on defects .",
    "although the experimental generation of toroidal nematics is a challenge , recent techniques ( @xcite ) allow for droplets of genus one or higher , and further motivate investigation of more complex surfaces .",
    "for vectors @xmath2 we denote by @xmath3 the standard euclidean inner product .",
    "we write @xmath4 to denote the norm of @xmath5 . for a two - tensor @xmath6",
    "we adopt the norm @xmath7 , which is invariant under change of coordinates .    in the classical director theory of nematics , the local orientation of the liquid crystal molecules in a sample @xmath8",
    "is described by the unit vector field @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the unit sphere .",
    "stable configurations are minimizers of the classical elastic energy , which according to frank s formula reads @xmath11 \\big]{\\mathrm{d } x},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive constants called the splay , twist , bend and saddle - splay moduli , respectively .",
    "the last term is a null lagrangian , hence it depends only on the behavior of @xmath16 on the boundary . while the frank s energy above is , within the director theories ,",
    "well accepted , there is not such agreement when dealing with surface energies . in the literature",
    ", one can find different proposals for such an energy ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference between the classical energy proposed in @xcite and the most recent one @xcite essentially lies in the choice of the differential operators on the surface @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , the energy in ( @xcite ) is a functional of the covariant derivative @xmath18 of the vector field @xmath16 , while the energy in @xcite depends on the surface gradient @xmath19 , which is defined as @xmath20 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , with @xmath21 being the orthogonal projection onto the tangent plane of @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath22 since the matrix product is non - commutative in general .",
    "in other words , @xmath23 is the restriction of the usual derivative of @xmath24 to directions lying in the tangent plane and takes thus into account also the extrinsic curvature of @xmath17 . in order to understand the effect of extrinsic curvature on @xmath25 and the precise difference between the terms in , it is useful to introduce the shape operator of a surface .",
    "denote by @xmath26 the unit normal vector to @xmath17 . at every point @xmath27",
    ", @xmath28 is a symmetric linear operator named the _ shape operator _ , the eigenvalues of which are exactly the two principal curvatures of @xmath17 in @xmath29 . given a smooth tangent vector field @xmath5 on @xmath17 , we can decompose the vector @xmath30 into its projection on the tangent space and a normal component ; by gauss formula ( * ? ? ?",

    "this decomposition implies the identity @xmath33 which clarifies the difference between covariant derivative and surface gradient . in order to describe the elastic energy of a thin film , approximated by a surface @xmath17 , we resort to the darboux frame @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",

    "consequently , for each choice of winding number there is at least one configuration which is stable in the sense that it is not possible to lower its energy without breaking the pattern on a line , i.e. , without creating a line defect . on the other hand ,",
    "large winding numbers impose large gradients on the director field , resulting in an increase in the intrinsic energy , monotone with respect to @xmath223 . in analogy with traditional elastic continua ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that a liquid crystal would break or yield after reaching a critical maximum distortion energy .",
    "we therefore expect a material - dependent upper bound on the observable winding number of the nematics field , which we hope could be determined experimentally .      although defect - free ground states can be found on the torus because of its zero euler characteristic , these are not the only minima which can be found .",
    "indeed , computational studies @xcite using an xy - model on tori of different radii ratios have found equilibrium configurations with defects of positive and negative charges with net zero charge .",
    "the reason we do not observe defects is not due to the choice parameters , but rather is inherent to the form of the energy @xmath52 .",
    "we claim that configurations with defects can not be local minimizers of @xmath52 _ unless the model is substantially modified _ , because the energy associated to any defect is @xmath190 .",
    "we remark that our results are not in contradiction with those of @xcite .",
    "in fact , computing the energy of a defect on a discrete grid as in @xcite is equivalent to removing a disc centred at the defect with diameter equal to the distance between the grid nodes .",
    "we would expect that by refining the grid , the energy of the discrete configuration would tend to the energy of the continuous configuration .",
    "in particular , it would tend to @xmath190 close to a defect .",
    "what prevents the formation of defects in our case is not a choice of the parameters @xmath121 or @xmath94 , but rather the choice of the initial datum in the evolution law ( 6 ) . in @xcite",
    "the initial configuration presents a random number of defects , which eventually pairwise annihilate , leaving survivors in multiples of 4 ( or no defects at all ) .",
    "instead , we choose defectless initial data , possibly with nontrivial winding number , which smoothly evolves into minimizers with the same winding .",
    "the observations regarding defects are well - studied in the literature , and in particular they were anticipated by lubensky and prost in @xcite who introduced a  short distance cutoff @xmath76 \" . by removing a small disc of radius @xmath76 ,",
    "they obtain an energy @xmath224 corresponding to a  condensation energy \" in the small disc , or alternatively to the  line tension \" of the boundary created by removing the disc .",
    "we analyzed nematic liquid crystals on a toroidal particle , finding new equilibrium configurations for the surface energy recently proposed by napoli and vergori in @xcite and comparing them to the equilibria of classical energies .",
    "we identified a range of parameters where the new energy selects a unique equilibrium among the classical ones , and we showed the emergence of new equilibria configurations , in accordance with the added penalization of the normal curvature and geodesic torsion of the director field .",
