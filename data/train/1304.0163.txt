    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest objects in the universe .",
    "the observed isotropic energy ( the apparent energy if it is emitted isotropically ) is of the order of or even sometimes more than the solar rest mass energy of @xmath4  erg .",
    "current understanding is that the grb prompt emission is produced by a relativistic collimated jet , whose ( half ) opening angle is @xmath5 and lorentz factor is more than @xmath6 , significantly alleviating the energy requirements .",
    "the opening angle of a grb jet is an important quantity not only for the energetics but also for the event rate of the grb .",
    "the opening angle also carries information about the central engine .",
    "it is difficult to get any information on the opening angle from observations of the prompt emission , which is beamed into an angle @xmath7 by a relativistic effect .",
    "the opening angle of a grb is measured by the light curve of the afterglow that follows the prompt grb .",
    "the afterglow light curve exhibits a break when the jet decelerates to a lorentz factor of @xmath8 , the so - called a jet break , and we can estimate the opening angle from the jet break time @xcite .",
    "recent observations suggest that the opening angle of long grbs are distributed over several to tens of degrees ( 6@xmath9 @xmath10 0.1 rad ; e.g. ,  fong et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "what physics determines the opening angle of grb jets is not known yet . in order to understand the physical origin of the jet opening angle",
    ", we have to closely examine jet propagation and breakout from the surrounding matter .",
    "because some grbs are associated with supernovae @xcite , a long grb is thought to arise from the death of a massive star .",
    "a jet is launched deep inside the progenitor , and should break out from the stellar envelope to be observed as a grb .",
    "this is the so - called collapsar model @xcite .",
    "when the jet collides with the stellar envelope , a shocked jet and a shocked envelope move sideways from the jet head and form a cocoon . at the expense of the shocked matter ,",
    "the jet head moves outward and finally drills a hole in the stellar envelope .",
    "this is called the jet breakout .",
    "there are many simulations of jet propagation for the collapsar model .",
    "@xcite were the first to show that a relativistic jet can penetrate the stellar envelope while maintaining good collimation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite studied jet propagation for collapsars with a wide range of jet parameters , such as luminosity , initial lorentz factor , and so on .",
    "@xcite discussed the evolution of the jet opening angle and indicated that the opening angle of the jet is relatively smaller than the initial opening angle .",
    "however the physical origin of the jet opening angle is still unclear .",
    "what determines the opening angle of the jet ?",
    "we consider that the opening angle is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lorentz factor at the jet breakout from the stellar envelope @xcite . in order to infer @xmath12 ,",
    "the cocoon pressure is important as it confines the jet @xcite . after passing through the collimation shock @xcite ,",
    "the jet becomes cylindrical since the cocoon pressure is uniform inside the star .",
    "a cylindrical jet is actually observed in simulations @xcite and recently discussed by @xcite in an analytical way .",
    "the lorentz factor of a cylindrical ( stationary ) jet is constant ( @xmath13 ) because of flux conservation .",
    "therefore a naive expectation is that the opening angle is given by the inverse of the initial lorentz factor , @xmath14 as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : break ] ( the conventional picture ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the evolution of the opening angle for long grb jet , and show that the naive expectation in equation ( [ eq : naive ] ) is partly false .",
    "we perform a series of numerical hydrodynamic simulations for jet propagation and breakout from collapsars .",
    "we find that the opening angle is a factor @xmath15 smaller than @xmath16 , and identify its physical origin with the jet - breakout acceleration , that is , the jet accelerates at the jet breakout before a free expansion as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : break ] ( the new picture ) .",
    "the jet - breakout acceleration boosts the lorentz factor @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath15 above than @xmath1 .",
    "thus equation ( [ eq : thjgab ] ) is correct but equation ( [ eq : naive ] ) is not correct .",
    "we also examine the jet dynamics in an analytical way .",
    "we first compare the numerical results with analytical formulae before the jet breakout by @xcite .",
    "we calibrate the model parameters with careful numerical calculations , and make the formulae easier to use .",
    "then we make an analytical model for the jet - breakout acceleration after the jet breakout .    in the new picture of figure",
    "[ fig : break ] , the grb duration ( @xmath17 ) is determined by the sound crossing time of the cocoon .",
    "after that time , the cocoon pressure decreases so that the jet is no longer confined by the cocoon .",
    "the opening angle widens from @xmath18 ( our result ) to @xmath19 ( free expansion ) , reducing the apparent isotropic luminosity by a factor of @xmath2025 .",
    "the grb appears to end even if the central engine is still active .",
    "therefore the jet - breakout acceleration is essential for the observed grb duration .",
    "we infer the initial lorentz factor of the jet ejected from the central engine by using the observed opening angles .",
    "we also argue for a possible origin of the observed spectral relations , the amati and yonetoku relations @xcite .",
    "we derive the slopes in both the relations with only one assumption on the jet injection : that the total jet luminosity is proportional to the initial lorentz factor ( @xmath21 ) , under the photosphere model of grb prompt emission .",
    "these are interesting suggestions for the emission mechanism of the prompt emission as well as the jet formation mechanism .",

    "the radial mass density distribution of the progenitor is almost a power law with an index @xmath50 at @xmath51  cm and quickly drops at @xmath52  cm .",
    "the mass density at the last grid of the progenitor ( @xmath53 ) is @xmath54 . outside the progenitor",
    ", we put a low density gas assuming a stellar wind with a power - law index @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "see the radial mass density profile in figure [ fig : radial_mass ] .",
    "assuming the jet formation deep inside the progenitor , we start the numerical calculation at a distance of @xmath57  cm from the center of the progenitor . from the innermost computational boundary ,",
    "we inlet the jet into the computational domain .",
    "at least four parameters are necessary to characterize the initial condition of the jet .",
    "we choose the cylindrical radius ( @xmath58 ) , the luminosity @xmath59 , the lorentz factor @xmath60 , and the specific enthalpy ( @xmath61 ) of the initial jet , where the subscript `` 0 '' stands for the injection parameter .",
    "since we inlet the jet parallel to the jet axis with a small radius @xmath62 , it is not necessary to assume an initial opening angle of the jet ( @xmath63 ) , which is determined by the relativistic beaming effect to be @xmath64 .",
    "this allows us to reduce the number of initial parameters .    1 .",
    "we adopt the initial cylindrical radius of the jet as @xmath65  cm .",
    "this value should be sufficiently smaller than equation ( [ eq : rj ] ) , which is supposed to be the cylindrical radius of the jet after the collimation shock ( i.e. , the cylindrical radius of the jet balanced with the cocoon pressure ) .",
    "if the initial cylindrical radius was larger than equation ( [ eq : rj ] ) , the jet dynamics would be different from the true ones because a thick jet sweeps out a large mass . even though @xmath58 should be small",
    ", we still need to cover the jet with a sufficient number of grid points . in our simulations , 8 and 16",
    "grid points cover the jet at the boundary for the resolutions , @xmath66  cm and @xmath67  cm , respectively .",
    "our resolution is high enough to resolve internal structures , such as shocks and vortices , inside the jet and the cocoon .",
    "we consider a constant luminosity jet ( @xmath68 ) for simplicity .",
    "thus the explosion energy is @xmath69 erg for a few tens of seconds duration the jet injection , which is comparable with the values inferred from the observations .",
    "another two parameters that define the initial jet are the specific enthalpy @xmath70 and the lorentz factor of the jet ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we fix the product of two parameters , i.e. , @xmath72 to be 538 in this paper .",
    "the product @xmath72 gives the maximum lorentz factor achieved by the adiabatic expansion , since @xmath73 is conserved by the relativistic bernoulli principle along a stream line for a steady state .",
    "a gas with large enthalpy ( @xmath74 ) expands adiabatically by decreasing @xmath75 and increasing @xmath12 , i.e. , the jet accelerates with a fixed @xmath73 .",
    "our assumption ( @xmath76 ) satisfies @xmath77 , which is required for avoiding the compactness problem of the grb .",
    "the recent _ fermi _ bursts suggest a relatively large @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the initial lorentz factors , @xmath78 and 10 , are studied to determine the dependence on @xmath71 of the jet dynamics and the opening angle after the jet breakout .",
    "these are the models : g2.5 ( @xmath79 ) , g5.0 ( @xmath80 ) , and g10 ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "these are the models : g2.5h ( @xmath79 ) , g5.0h ( @xmath80 ) , and g10h ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "since we fix @xmath82 , the initial enthalpy ( @xmath83 ) is the smallest ( @xmath84 ) for the case with @xmath81 .",
    "thus all jets are initially thermal - dominated plasma ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the initial specific internal energy ( @xmath86 ) is 80 for the model with @xmath80 . as shown later , these initial lorentz factors are crucial parameters for the final opening angles .",

    "it is necessary to follow the lagrange motion of the fluid elements to define the opening angle of the jet , since the jet opening angle depends on time .",
    "every 0.01 s , 32 particles are injected into the computational domain with the jet . in the injection region at @xmath102  cm , 32 particles are uniformly spaced at @xmath103 . in every hydrodynamic time step ( @xmath104 ) , the particles move with their local velocities calculated by the hydrodynamic simulation , i.e , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the position of a particle and @xmath107 is the local velocity .",
    "tracing the lagrangian motion of the fluid elements allows us to find the location where the free expansion starts after the jet breakout .",
    "since we define the jet opening angle by the direction of free expansion ( see , section [ sec : opening_angle ] ) , the lagrangian motion is very important for the quantitative analysis , especially for finding a relationship between the opening angle and the lorentz factor .",
    "the particle path is also useful for identifying whether the fluid elements have moved into the cocoon or not .",
    "the jets in all models of table [ models ] successfully drill through the stellar envelops . before the jet breakout",
    ", the jet hits the reverse shock that is produced by the interaction between the jet and the stellar envelope .",
    "then , the shocked jet moves sideway , forming a high pressure cocoon , as shown in the schematic figure  [ fig : physicsmap ] @xcite .",
    "the high pressure in the cocoon works to confine the jet .",
    "the jet is confined through a collimation shock that deflects the velocity vector into a direction parallel to the cylindrical axis .",
    "the high pressure cocoon is also discussed in the context of fanaroff - riley type ii jets @xcite .",
    "when the forward shock reaches the stellar surface , the shocked stellar envelope starts to expand into the circumstellar matter , i.e. , shock breakout occurs .",
    "soon the jet also starts to expand into the circumstellar matter , i.e. , jet breakout occurs , as presented in previous numerical simulations @xcite . after jet breakout ,",
    "the jet advances in the circumstellar matter which is assumed to be very dilute .",
    "the jet is well confined by the high pressure cocoon before the jet breakout .",
    "figure [ fig : gam0_5_0045 ] shows the contours of the mass density , the pressure and the lorentz factor of the jet just before the jet breakout for the model g5.0 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we should note that the @xmath30 axis is elongated and the aspect ratio of @xmath28 and @xmath30 is not unity in order to highlight the fine structures in the jet and the cocoon .",
    "although we inlet a jet with a velocity parallel to the cylindrical axis , the jet tries to expand with an opening angle of @xmath108 because the thermal energy is large . around the injection point ,",
    "the lorentz factor rapidly increases and then drops across a discontinuity . since the pressure and the mass density increase across this discontinuity , it is the shock surface .",
    "the shock deflects the velocity vector almost towards the jet axis , and is the so - called collimation shock .",
    "the collimation shock is produced by the interaction between the expanding jet and the high pressure cocoon @xcite .",
    "to distinguish it from the other collimating oblique shocks in the jet , we sometimes call it the first collimation shock .",
    "see the schematic figure  [ fig : physicsmap ] .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : gam0_5_0045 ] , after the first collimation shock , the jet maintains an overall cylindrical shape @xcite .",
    "the lorentz factor increases to a few tens and then drops to @xmath109 , i.e. , the initial lorentz factor , after the first collimation shock , see equation  ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "the lorentz factor after the first collimation shock remains constant with time on average , although the pressure in the cocoon gradually decreases with time , since the timescale for the cocoon to change is much longer than that for the jet to cross the cylindrical region .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dpressure](c ) shows the one - dimensional lorentz factor profile along the @xmath28 axis .",
    "we can understand the cylindrical evolution as follows .",
    "the propagation velocity of the jet head is comparable to the sound velocity of the shocked envelope ( obviously ) and is much smaller than the sound velocity of the shocked jet ( with high entropy ) at the jet head .",
    "the shocked jet goes backward around the jet and provides a constant cocoon pressure over the jet .",
    "namely , the flow in the cocoon is subsonic . although the mean sound velocity of the cocoon , which is comparable with the transverse velocity of the bow shock , is lower than the jet head velocity , the matter is only partially mixed in the cocoon .",
    "thus , the gas in the cocoon can communicate with each other , resulting in a homogeneous pressure profile in the cocoon .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dpressure](a ) shows the pressure profile at @xmath110  cm as a function of @xmath28 . at @xmath111",
    "s ( before the jet breakout ) , we can see a relatively constant pressure profile over the cocoon . since the jet is confined by the homogeneous pressure in the cocoon ,",
    "the jet maintains a cylindrical structure after passing the first collimation shock .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:1dpressure](a ) ( @xmath112s ) , the homogeneous pressure decreases with time , and the cylindrical radius of the jet increases with time . the constant pressure profile in the cocoon breaks around the head of the jet .",
    "+   +    the lorentz factor should be constant over the cylindrical jet because of flux conservation .",
    "the lorentz factor remains @xmath109 , although some fluctuations appear in the lorentz factor due to the internal oblique shocks ; see figure  [ fig:1dpressure](c ) .",
    "the internal oblique shocks occur in the cylindrical jet for several reasons .",
    "the first reason is that the jet converges to the axis after the first collimation shock .",
    "the jet shrinks the cylindrical radius , resulting in an oblique shock .",
    "the second reason is similar to that for the first collimation shock .",
    "the shrinking jet becomes over - pressured and bounces .",
    "this is like the initial expansion at the injection and thereby leads to the second collimation shock .",
    "such a cycle of expansion and collimation is repeated several times .",
    "note that the jet has a larger initial cylindrical radius in the second and later collimations than in the first one .",
    "the third reason is the fluctuation of the cocoon pressure @xcite .",
    "the cocoon is produced by the shocked jet and the shocked envelope .",
    "the shocked jet at the jet head goes sideways and also backward under the pressure of the shocked envelope @xcite .",
    "together with the shear motion between the shocked jet and the shocked envelope , a large vortex and a turbulent structure is formed in the cocoon .",
    "the turbulence in the cocoon makes a perturbation at the contact discontinuity between the cocoon and the jet , which causes the oblique shocks in the jet .",
    "because shocks are tilted to the jet axis , we call these shocks oblique shocks in the jet .    at the last stage of the propagation in the progenitor",
    ", we identify a jet - breakout acceleration .",
    "since the density distribution of the envelope drops exponentially at the stellar surface @xmath113  ( @xmath114 cm ; see figure  [ fig : radial_mass ] ) , the jet head advances rapidly ( @xmath115 , the speed of light ) . as a result ,",
    "the pressure profile in the cocoon can not remain constant around the jet head . the pressure profile in the cocoon drops near the jet head",
    "; see the one - dimensional pressure profile in the cocoon in figure  [ fig:1dpressure](a ) at @xmath116  s when the jet breakout just occurs .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dpressure](b ) shows the same as figure  [ fig:1dpressure](a ) for but when the @xmath28-axis is shifted by @xmath117 , where @xmath117 is approximately the position at which the jet starts to expand .",
    "the jet can not maintain its cylindrical structure near the jet head even after passing the oblique shock , since the cocoon pressure drops before the jet breakout .",
    "the jet expands in the decreasing cocoon pressure and accelerates by converting thermal energy into kinetic energy .",
    "the lorentz factor of the jet increases to a few tens even after the oblique shock .",
    "see the lorentz factor contour near the jet head in figures  [ fig : gam0_5_0045 ] and [ fig:1dpressure](c ) and the discussion in section  [ sec : model.postbreak ] .      soon after the forward shock reaches the stellar surface , jet breakout occurs .",
    "the jet and the cocoon ( a mix of the shocked jet and the shocked stellar envelope ) start to expand into the circumstellar matter which is assumed to be very dilute .",
    "the expansion velocity of the cocoon is comparable to the sound velocity before the jet breakout ( @xmath20 a few tens of percent of the speed of light ) .",
    "so , the cocoon stays near the stellar surface for 10 s ( see section  [ sec : duration ] ) , providing pressure for the jet confinement .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:1dpressure](b ) , for @xmath118  s , the cocoon pressure is decreasing outward , ranging from @xmath119 to @xmath120 ( the off - center case ) .",
    "on the other hand , the supersonic jet does not notice the cocoon profile until a collimation shock is formed",
    ". in the star , the jet is repeating a cycle of the expansion and the ( over-)collimation that maintains the cylindrical structure ; see sections  [ sec : before ] and [ sec : opening_angle ] .",
    "near the stellar surface , the jet also expands without noticing the outwardly decreasing pressure before the shock .",
    "note that the expansion is off - center near the stellar surface , not from the stellar center .",
    "the off - center origin makes the pressure profile shallower ( figure  [ fig:1dpressure](b ) ) than that shown in figure  [ fig:1dpressure](a ) with a stellar center origin .",
    "since the pressure profile is still shallower than @xmath121 , the jet is collimated but the collimation is not enough to keep the cylindrical radius fixed ( see section  [ sec : opening_angle ] ) .",
    "this expansion leads to the jet - breakout acceleration , as shown in section  [ sec : model.postbreak ] .",
    "even after the last collimating oblique shock , a certain level of confinement continues without forming a shock ( or with a weak shock ) , but the jet expands laterally , leading to an additional jet - breakout acceleration ( see section  [ sec : model.postbreak ] ) . finally the jet starts to expand freely after the pressure profile gets steeper than @xmath122 .",
    "as time goes on , the steep pressure profile moves inward , while the first collimation shock becomes large .",
    "then the jet starts a free expansion after crossing the first collimation shock .",
    "figure [ fig : gam0_5_0139 ] shows the mass density , the pressure , and the lorentz factor contours of the model g5.0 ( @xmath80 ) at @xmath118 s. there are many oblique shocks in the jet , not only inside the progenitor but also outside the progenitor .",
    "the oblique shocks outside the star are imprinted before the free expansion and expand in a self - similar way , because the internal shocks were not developed in a freely accelerating flow without confinement @xcite .",
    "the jet advances with a velocity close to the speed of the light , whereas the cocoon expands with a sub - relativistic speed . as the cocoon pressure decreases , the first collimation shock expands and the converging point of the shock moves outside the progenitor star .      since probe particles are introduced in the jet ( section [ sec : probe ] )",
    ", we can trace the particle path and measure the opening angle of the jet .",
    "figure [ fig : trajectory ] shows the traces of particles that are injected at the same time ( @xmath123  s ) .",
    "the path of each particle repeats the cycle of expansion and collimation inside the star and the last collimation near the stellar surface is not so strong that the cylindrical radius of the jet becomes large . just outside the progenitor ( @xmath124 )",
    ", the particles do not yet start a free expansion . at some distance which depends on the particles , the particle path finally becomes straight ,",
    "i.e. , the jet freely expands as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the position where the particle path becomes straight depends on when and where the particle is injected .",
    "the location of free expansion starts at @xmath125  cm for early particles which were near the head of the jet at the jet breakout .",
    "then , the locations to start the free expansion move inward for subsequent particles .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ fig : trajectory ] indicate the slopes of the inverse of the local lorentz factor ( @xmath126 ) for the laterally outermost particle .",
    "the left arrow is @xmath126 just after the last collimating oblique shock ( @xmath127  cm ) .",
    "although the jet behind the shock has a higher lorentz factor than that in the star , the arrow is pointing outside the jet opening angle .",
    "thus , the jet is still confined by the cocoon and can not expand freely , drawing a concave particle path in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] .",
    "finally , the path becomes straight from the base of the right arrow ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the direction of the arrow almost coincides with the freely expanding direction .",
    "this means that the opening angle of the jet is determined by the lorentz factor of the flow when the free expansion starts as in equation  ( [ eq : thjgab ] ) .",
    "the extrapolations of the free expansion lines do not cross the center of the progenitor , i.e. , the explosion is off - center .",
    "the explosion center moves gradually inward as time passes .",
    "the off - center position is different even for particles injected at the same time .",
    "we note that the acceleration of the lorentz factor by a factor of @xmath15 does not take @xmath15 stellar radii .",

    "the shock breakout times ( 6.6 s and 7.5 s ) are different by @xmath163 s even if the jet parameters are the same in figure[fig : gam0_25_0066 ] and [ fig : resolution ] .",

    "one should note that the recollimation shocks are different .",
    "the low resolution one converges on the axis while the high resolution one makes a mach disk .",
    "the difference is probably caused by the nonlinear evolution of the jet and the cocoon dynamics .",
    "a small difference in the oblique shocks near the head of the jet changes the cross - sectional radius of the reverse shock and hence the jet head speed .",

    "@xmath57  cm , we set the initial cylindrical radius of the jet to be @xmath164 . the initial cylindrical radius should be smaller than the value in equation  ( [ eq : rj ] ) , the cylindrical radius of the jet after the collimation shock .",
    "otherwise , the jet evolution is different .",
    "the jet does not show an initial expansion but maintains its the incorrect cylindrical radius .",
    "this gives wrong dynamics for the breakout time , the cocoon energetics , and the opening angle .",
    "that is why we start the numerical simulation with so small an initial cylindrical radius .",
    "at least several or 10 grid points are necessary for covering the initial cylindrical radius because we have to resolve the internal shocks .",
    "this sets the scale for the fine grid points as used in this study .",
    "our simulations use one of the finest resolutions so far .",
    "we have run one of the highest resolution hydrodynamic simulations of jet propagation .",
    "high resolution reduces the numerical baryon loading which affects the jet dynamics .",
    "since the numerical baryon loading is the most dangerous at the boundary with a high contrast of the enthalpy @xmath75 , the highest resolution grid points appear around the region that covers the jet and some part of the cocoon .",
    "the highest resolution grid size is comparable to or better than that used in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the highest resolution region is much larger than that used in @xcite .",
    "since we have run quite high resolution calculations for hydrodynamic simulations of the jet dynamics , the computational domain is restricted to about 10 times larger than the progenitor size .",
    "this is smaller than that used in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our discussion is restricted to only several seconds after the jet breakout .",
    "the computational box size is comparable with that used in @xcite who discussed the time evolution of the opening angle of the jet .",
    "the requirement that the initial cylindrical radius of the jet should be sufficiently small is also one of the reasons for using high - resolution grid points ( see section  [ sec : initail_size ] ) .",
    "we have paid special care by applying a sufficiently small cylindrical radius of the initial jet .",
    "the dynamics of our results may be different from those of @xcite , who took the initial radius to @xmath165  cm for the @xmath166 case .",
    "this is about 2.2 times larger than our initial cylindrical radius of the jet ( @xmath167  cm ) .",
    "our numerical results show that the opening angle of the jet after jet breakout is narrower than what we expect ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "this trend is consistent with previous numerical simulations , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who pointed out that the opening angle after the jet breakout is smaller than the initial opening angle ( @xmath63 ) . in this paper",
    "we introduce much more sophisticated analysis with probe particles that allows us to follow the lagrangian motion of each element .",

    "we identify that the jet breakout acceleration occurs and that the local lorentz factor of the flow just before the free expansion determines the opening angle of the jet .",
    "since we measure the opening angle based on the free expansion direction with respect to the jet axis , the angle is different from that measured by @xcite , who defined the jet opening angle by measuring how the grb jet component ( @xmath171 ) spreads out at @xmath172  cm in spherical coordinates ( the progenitor center is the origin of the coordinate ) .",
    "the different measurement methods result in about a 30 % difference in the opening angle of the jet .",
    "let us consider analytical models of the jet propagation and the dynamics of the opening angle .",
    "the evolution is generally divided into two phases , i.e. , before and after the jet breakout .    in section  [ sec : model.prebreak ] , we discuss the pre - breakout phase .",
    "@xcite investigated the pre - breakout evolution in detail . before the breakout",
    ", the jet is inside the progenitor star and collimated by the cocoon pressure .",
    "since the cocoon pressure is constant ( subsonic inside ) , the jet becomes cylindrical through the first collimation shock .",
    "the cylindrical ( and stationary ) flow has a constant lorentz factor because of flux conservation .",
    "if the lorentz factor were constant even at the jet breakout , the opening angle of the jet would be the inverse of the initial lorentz factor ( or the initial opening angle ; see below ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : break ] , but this is not the case as shown in section  [ sec : model.postbreak ] .",
    "we present analytical formulae of the jet propagation for easy comparison with our numerical simulations .",
    "we also calibrate the model parameters , taking great care with the baryon contamination and the initial jet size .",
    "we compare the evolution of three physical quantities , the jet head position , the jet cylindrical radius , and the collimation position , with numerical calculations .",

    "the cocoon pressure is not constant but decreases outward ( see figure  [ fig:1dpressure ] ) .",
    "this leads to less collimation , a wider jet , and hence a larger lorentz factor .",
    "therefore , the jet - breakout acceleration occurs almost inevitably if the external medium has a finite size .",
    "we estimate that the jet - breakout acceleration boosts the lorentz factor of the jet by a factor of several ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "the cocoon pressure that is decreasing outward is expressed by @xmath249 under this pressure , we can solve the geometry of the collimation shock , as in section [ sec : model.prebreak ] with equations  ( [ eq : csbalance ] ) and ( [ eq : sinpsi ] ) : @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the initial position of the collimation shock and @xmath252 we show the shock geometry in figure  [ fig : jet_schematic ] .",
    "note that the shock geometry is not a parabola , in contrast with the constant pressure case in equation  ( [ eq : shockpconst ] ) .",
    "the collimation shock expands to a maximum cylindrical radius at @xmath213 , where the maximally - expanding position is given by @xmath253^{\\frac{2}{2-\\lambda}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath254 is necessary for the shock to converge . at the position @xmath215 , the general relation for a hot jet in equation  ( [ eq : hotjet ] )",
    "is given by @xmath255 \\gamma_{1}^2   \\left(\\pi \\theta_0 ^ 2 z_{\\max}^2\\right ) c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this yields the lorentz factor after the collimation shock , @xmath256 which is larger than that for a constant pressure case in equation  ( [ eq : gamma.const ] ) by @xmath257 for small @xmath258 . to be precise",
    ", @xmath63 is not the initial opening angle of the jet here , but the opening angle of the jet expanding to the last collimating oblique shock , which is the inverse of the lorentz factor inside a jet @xmath153 and thereby turns out to be @xmath63 from equations  ( [ eq : gamma.const ] ) and ( [ eq : gaj * ] ) .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the total acceleration factor is @xmath259 ( see figure  [ fig : analytic ] ) , about half of which is achieved at the collimation shock and the other half of which is obtained later .",
    "a factor @xmath260 can be explained by @xmath261 .",
    "although it is difficult to estimate the exact acceleration factor @xmath262 analytically , we can see that @xmath262 is mainly determined by the slope @xmath263 of the external pressure profile . in our case ,",
    "the external pressure profile is shaped by the cocoon expansion to outer space , which does not depend on the jet properties so much .",
    "therefore it is natural that similar acceleration factors are obtained for the different initial conditions in our numerical calculations .",
    "next , we consider a jet - breakout acceleration without shocks ( i.e. , an adiabatic jet ) as the other extreme .",
    "the jet expands in a decreasing pressure , decreasing its temperature as radiation , i.e. , @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is the comoving volume of the jet .",
    "if the pressure in the jet balances with the pressure in the cocoon , i.e. , @xmath266 , the jet does not perform work and hence the energy is conserved and @xmath267 const .",
    "therefore the jet accelerates as the size grows according to @xcite @xmath268 in the numerical calculations , we identify such an adiabatic evolution after the collimation shock , in particular at the periphery of the jet . for @xmath269 , the cocoon pressure does not causally affect the jet interior @xcite but can still affect the periphery of the jet .",
    "note that the off - center origin makes the pressure profile ( figure  [ fig:1dpressure](b ) ) shallower than that shown in figure  [ fig:1dpressure](a ) , which the assumes a stellar center origin .    in order to estimate the acceleration factor of the lorentz factor",
    ", we need to know how much the jet expands before entering a free expansion phase . in this regard",
    ", we should note that the jet expands from the breakout position , that is , the fireball of the jet is off - centered by the cocoon confinement .",
    "this means that the fireball size should not be measured from the center of the star . instead",
    ", the effective center of the fireball is located at a distance @xmath270 inward from the stellar surface ( breakout point ) because the jet tries to expand with an opening angle of @xmath16 and the expanding surface has an initial cylindrical radius of @xmath271 in equation  ( [ eq : rj ] ) .",
    "so , the initial fireball size is @xmath272 if the fireball expands to a size of the stellar radius @xmath273 cm , the expansion factor is about @xmath274 times for the typical parameters in equation .",
    "( [ eq : rj ] ) and hence the lorentz factor grows by a factor @xmath246 for @xmath275 , according to equation  ( [ eq : gammaz ] ) .",
    "thus , the adiabatic expansion can explain a part of the jet - breakout acceleration observed in the numerical calculations . here ,",
    "a parameter dependence of the expansion factor is weak since the initial fireball size is @xmath276 at the breakout time ( when @xmath277 ) with equations  ( [ eq : zh2 ] ) and ( [ eq : rj ] ) .",
    "note that the jet - breakout acceleration looks very rapid at first glance if we do not note the off - center effect ( i.e. , the radius measured from the stellar center is only doubled ) .",
    "the opening angle of the grb jet is usually measured by observing a jet break in the afterglow lightcurve @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations show that a jet opening angle is related to the lorentz factor inside a star by @xmath278 by applying this formula , we can infer the lorentz factor inside a star ( or the initial opening angle ) from the observed opening angle of the grb jet .",
    "figure [ fig : fong12 ] shows the estimated lorentz factor inside a star .",
    "the result suggests that the jet is mildly relativistic in a star ( or the initial opening angle is o(0.3 - 0.5 ) rad ) .",
    "a slow jet inside a star is a preferable condition for the survival of nuclei in the jet , which may explain the observed ultra - high energy cosmic ray nuclei @xcite",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : thjga0 ] ) also implies that the maximum opening angle is obtained by setting @xmath279 as @xmath280 if the jet is radiation dominated at the breakout .",
    "however several events violate this maximum , as shown in figure  [ fig : fong12 ] @xcite .",
    "there are two possibilities to this problem .",
    "the first is to consider a baryon - rich slow sheath surrounding a central jet .",
    "a baryon - rich flow can not accelerate to a large lorentz factor , and if the lorentz factor of the baryon - rich sheath is less than @xmath15 , the opening angle of the sheath can be larger than @xmath281 .",
    "note that the central jet should have @xmath282 to avoid the compactness problem .",
    ", so that the final opening angle after the breakout might be also larger than the maximum value in equation  ( [ eq : thjmax ] )",
    ". however , the collimation of the spherically expanding flow can not be treated by the formulae in this paper and @xcite .",
    "so , we leave this possibility for the future studies . ]",
    "the second is to consider long - acting engine activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after several tens of seconds in equation  ( [ eq : duration ] ) , the jet is no longer confined by the cocoon and the opening angle can widen to @xmath19 without the factor of @xmath15 ( see the next section ) .",
    "if the jet energy is dominated by the wide opening angle component , the wide component determines the opening angle of the jet obtained from the afterglow observations .      in our new picture with the jet - breakout acceleration in figure  [ fig : break ]",
    ", the grb duration would be determined by the sound crossing time of the cocoon , which is about @xmath283 , where the sound velocity in the cocoon is about @xmath284 in equation  ( [ eq : betac ] ) . at @xmath285 ,",
    "the cocoon persists around the star and provides pressure for collimating the jet into an opening angle @xmath286 in equation  ( [ eq : thj ] ) .",
    "however , at @xmath287 , the cocoon pressure decreases and thereby the jet is no longer confined . the opening angle of the jet increases to @xmath288 , which is determined by the free expansion without the jet - breakout acceleration ( see also morsony et al .",
    "then , the apparent luminosity of the grb jet is reduced by a factor of @xmath289 . even if the jet injection continues after @xmath287 ,",
    "we observe that the grb terminates .",
    "therefore we expect the observed duration to be @xmath290 with equations([eq : betac ] ) , ( [ eq : xiadef ] ) , and ( [ eq : pc3 ] ) , we have @xmath291 here it is appropriate to set the time @xmath228 to the breakout time determined by @xmath292 in equation  ( [ eq : zh ] ) , which is @xmath293 then we have @xmath294 which is consistent with the observed grb duration @xmath295 sec .",
    "we again set @xmath231 [ @xmath232 , @xmath233 in equation  ( [ eq : xialpha ] ) ] and @xmath234 for the numerical values .",
    "based on our numerical and analytical modeling , we can evaluate the initial condition of a jet that is just expanding freely and infer the observational characteristics of the jet based on the photospheric model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , since we are now able to estimate the opening angle of the jet in equation  ( [ eq : thjga0 ] ) , we can assess the isotropic luminosity of the jet : @xmath296 we can also obtain the observed temperature of a jet if it is radiation dominated : @xmath297 which may be identified with the spectral peak energy @xmath298 of a grb in the photosphere model . in the actual observations of grbs , there is a relation between the isotropic luminosity and the observed temperature , @xmath299 the so - called yonetoku relation @xcite .",
    "let us show that the yonetoku relation can be reproduced if we assume that the total jet luminosity is propositional to the lorentz factor inside the star @xmath300 that is , the mass outflow rate is @xmath301 const .",
    "first , the above equation gives @xmath302 with equation  ( [ eq : liso ] ) .",
    "next , substituting equations  ( [ eq : liso ] ) and ( [ eq : epeak ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : hotjet ] ) ( where we should read @xmath303 as @xmath1 ) yields @xmath304 the jet breakout occurs when @xmath305 at the time @xmath306 obtained from equation  ( [ eq : zh2 ] ) ( see also equation  ( [ eq : br ] ) ) . at this time the jet cross - section follows @xmath307 from equation  ( [ eq : rj ] ) . then , noting @xmath308 , we have @xmath309 which is close to the yonetoku relation .    in addition",
    ", we may be also able to reproduce the amati relation @xcite , @xmath310 we can think that the grb duration is roughly given by the sound - crossing time across the cocoon of the stellar size in equation  ( [ eq : t90 ] ) , @xmath311 with equations  ( [ eq : betac ] ) and ( [ eq : pc3 ] ) , because the cocoon pressure decreases after this time , leading to less confinement , a larger opening angle , and a smaller isotropic luminosity of the jet .",
    "note that the weak correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath146 is actually observed .",
    "then , we can estimate the isotropic energy as @xmath312 which is also similar to the amati relation .",
    "this is killing two birds with one stone , that is , we explain the slopes of two relations ( the amati and yonetoku relations ) by only one assumption in equation  ( [ eq : constmdot ] ) .",
    "we leave the explanation of the normalization factor for future studies .",
    "@xcite reproduced the amati relation in the context of the photosphere model by combining their numerical results with an analytical model for estimating the peak energy .",
    "it is not easy to compare the @xcite model with our analytic model . since in @xcite ,",
    "most radiation is released in the coasting phase , in which the most thermal energy has been converted to kinetic energy , the temperature estimation is different from our estimates .",
    "the second is that the viewing angle dependence mainly produces the amati relation in @xcite , which is different from our cases .",
    "in this paper we have explored the dynamics of grb jets from collapsars by performing two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations as well as analytical modeling .",
    "we have followed the jet propagation all the way from the progenitor star through the jet breakout to the free expansion , implementing probe particles to trace the lagrangian motion of the fluid elements .",
    "this enables us to connect the final jet appearance to the initial jet conditions near the central engine .",
    "we have found that the jet opening angle after the jet breakout is about @xmath286 in equation  ( [ eq : thj ] ) and figure  [ fig : angle.gamma ] , where @xmath1 is the initial lorentz factor of the jet injected into the progenitor star .",
    "this value is smaller than the naive expectation of @xmath288 in figure  [ fig : break ] , where we thought that the opening angle was determined by the inverse of the lorentz factor and that the lorentz factor maintains its the initial value of @xmath1 for a cylindrical jet .",
    "actually , this is partly correct .",
    "the jet becomes cylindrical under the nearly homogeneous pressure of the cocoon after crossing the first collimation shock .",
    "the lorentz factor after the collimation shock is @xmath313 and largely stays constant before the jet breakout , according to our simulations .",
    "however , we have identified the `` jet - breakout acceleration '' just before and after the jet breakout .",
    "this occurs because the pressure profile of the cocoon can not remain constant but decreases outward as the cocoon expands to outer space .",
    "the cocoon still confines the jet to some extent near the stellar radius , while the jet expands its cylindrical radius with increasing its lorentz factor by a factor @xmath15 before a free expansion .",
    "therefore the jet opening angle becomes narrow , which is determined by the inverse of the lorentz factor at the base of the free expansion , as explicitly shown by the numerical simulations .",
    "the opening angles are roughly constant over time with a factor @xmath244 fluctuation in figure  [ fig : angle.time ] .",
    "we have also analytically modeled the jet - breakout acceleration .",
    "the jet - breakout acceleration occurs with and without the collimating oblique shock , and both are equally important . for the former case , we solve the structure of the collimating oblique shock in a decreasing pressure profile and obtain the lorentz factor after the shock in equation  ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) .",
    "the post - shock lorentz factor is enhanced appreciably for a pressure slope close to @xmath275 in @xmath314 .",
    "the latter case happens after the last collimating oblique shock , even for @xmath315 near the periphery of the jet in equation  ( [ eq : gammaz ] ) .",
    "we have also compared our numerical results with the analytical formulae for jet propagation inside the star presented by @xcite , and have confirmed a good agreement . for later use ,",
    "we have calibrated the model parameter with the numerical results .",
    "we can now calculate the jet evolution relatively precisely with ease , such as the jet head position , the jet cylindrical radius , and the converging position of the collimation shock , for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "we have paid special attention to the numerical diffusion of the baryon loading into the jet through the discontinuity , which can entirely change the jet propagation .",
    "we have also taken the initial cylindrical radius of the jet to be sufficiently smaller than the radius after the first collimation shock , because a large initial radius slows down the jet propagation .",
    "for these purposes , we have performed one of the highest resolution calculations so far .",
    "the post - breakout jet shows a hollow - cone angular structure .",
    "the edge is relatively sharp with an exponential drop .",
    "the bright rim is produced by the shock between the expanding jet and the high pressure cocoon before the free expansion .",
    "to understand the jet evolution , it is important to note that the jet expands off - center as a result of the cocoon confinement .",
    "if the expansion origin is the stellar center , the fireball would feel a steep pressure profile of the cocoon pressure and the acceleration would be slow .",
    "in addition , the opening angle should be measured from the off - center origin for precise analyses .",
    "we have also applied our results to the observations .",
    "first we infer the initial lorentz factor @xmath1 of the jet injected at the central engine by using the observed opening angles in figure  [ fig : fong12 ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 peaks at around @xmath244@xmath316 .",
    "second , our result suggests the existence of a maximum opening angle for a high - entropy jet , @xmath317 , in equation  ( [ eq : thjmax ] ) .",
    "however several bursts violate this maximum value .",
    "this may imply a two - component jet with a baryon - rich slow sheath surrounding a central jet , or a long - lasting jet after the grb prompt emission .",
    "the opening angle evolution with the jet - breakout acceleration is also important for determining the observed duration of grb . in particular ,",
    "the grb duration is given by the sound crossing time of the cocoon in equation  ( [ eq : pc3 ] ) . before this time",
    ", the cocoon continues to exist around the jet and confines it into an opening angle @xmath318 , while after that , the jet expands freely and the opening angle increases to @xmath247 .",
    "this reduces the apparent luminosity of the grb , effectively terminating the observed grb .",
    "we have also derived the slopes of the amati and yonetoku spectral relations by applying our results to the photosphere of the jet that is expanding freely after the jet breakout .",
    "we explain the slopes of both the relations with only one assumption that the jet luminosity is proportional to the initial lorentz factor , @xmath319 , in equation  ( [ eq : constmdot ] ) , i.e. , the mass outflow rate is independent of the jet luminosity , @xmath320 const .",
    "the fireball temperature becomes different from the value at the central engine after the jet propagation through the star .",
    "thus the confinement by the cocoon and the off - center expansion of the jet may be the missing pieces for the photosphere model so far .    in the future , it will be interesting to study the long - term evolution of the jet studied in this paper and the evolution of the low - luminosity jet and the two - component jet .",
    "it will also be important to investigate jet propagation in a huge progenitor such as the population iii grbs @xcite and ultra - long grbs @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to perform magnetohydordynamic simulations to study the effect of magnetic fields on the jet dynamics and the opening angle of the jet .",
    "for example , @xcite have performed magnetohydordynamic simulations in the context of active galactic nucleus jets .",
    "three - dimensional numerical hydrodynamic simulation including precession or other effects will also be interesting ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
