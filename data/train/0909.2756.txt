    "up to 2009 , there is about 50 high redshift sources detected in the co lines .",
    "this domain of research has grown quickly , from the first discovery in 1992 , of the faint iras source f10214 + 4724 at=2.3 ( brown & van den bout 1992 , solomon et al 1992 ) .",
    "most of the sources have a redshift between z=2 and 3 .",
    "recently , iono et al ( 2009 ) observed 30 of these sources homogeneously in co(3 - 2 ) with sma , and found a very good correlation between co and fir luminosities , even for qso .",
    "this means that , although the contribution of the agn to the fir luminosity increases with power , the starburst always dominate .    the advantage to detect the co lines , is to obtain the efficiency of star formation ( ratio of fir luminosity to the gas content ) , which evolves quickly with redshift , and when resolved , study the kinematics and mass at high z : for example , the source smm j2399 - 0136 at z=2.808 , has been spatially resolved with the iram interferometer , and a hint of rotation curve has been found at z=2.808 ( genzel et al 2003 ) . taking into account the lens amplification factor of 2.5 ,",
    "the h@xmath0 mass derived is 6 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 , and the dynamical mass is 3.0 10@xmath3/sin@xmath4i m@xmath2 , uncertain , since the inclination of the object is not well determined .",
    "thanks to strong gravitational amplification , it was possible to detect co line emission towards 6 quasars at z larger than 4 , and determine their surprising properties .",
    "the most distant quasar detected , sdss j1148 + 5251 at z=6.4 , is a unique object , at the end of the epoch of reionization .",
    "the gunn - peterson trough is detected in hi absorption in its spectrum ( fan et al 2003 , white et al 2003 ) . in this powerful starburst , of surface density 1000 m@xmath2/year /kpc@xmath4 ,",
    "an impressive list of molecules has been detected , and even ionised carbon cii ( 158@xmath5 m redshifted at 1 mm ) , cf walter et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "surprisingly the hcn molecule is not detected , while hcn is the better tracer of star formation , well correlated with fir ( gao & solomon 2004 ) .",
    "one of the common features of the z@xmath64 quasars , resolved in the co(2 - 1 ) line with the vla , is that they are gas - rich mergers of galaxies , with complex morphologies , and molecular extent of about 5kpc , much larger than local ulirgs ( riechers et al 2008a , b ) . once corrected for their strong amplification , their h@xmath0 mass is up to 10@xmath3 m@xmath2 , a significant fraction of the dynamical mass . although the latter is ill - defined , given the perturbed shapes .",
    "their black hole masses , derived assuming their agn radiate at eddington luminosity , or from the nuclear emission lines , appear an order of magnitude higher than expected from the magorian relation .",
    "but uncertainties are large .",
    "their star formation surface density is saturating around 1000 m@xmath2/year /kpc@xmath4 , as for eddington limited star formation , i.e. dust opacity limited gas surface density .",
    "the average h@xmath0 column density reaches 10@xmath7 @xmath8 , and the volumic density 10@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "objects at more moderate sfr are not detected , unless strongly amplified .",
    "three lyman - break galaxies ( lbg ) at z@xmath11 3 , such as the cosmic eye ( coppin et al 2007 ) with a magnification of @xmath11 30 , also satisfy the same fir - co luminosity relation .",
    "their star formation rate is of the order of 50 m@xmath2/year , with a starburst time - scale of 40myr , they are the high - z analog of local lirgs .    the most efficient star forming objects appear to be the submillimeter galaxies ( smg ) , which have been selected by their fir luminosity , redshifted in the mm .",
    "they are more efficient than ulirgs , and are very compact starbursts , of radius lower than 1kpc , or less .",
    "but all detected objects at high z are not so efficient .",
    "recently , the bzk galaxies , selected for their red colors , have been detected with much more co emission than expected , at z=1.5 - 2 ( daddi et al 2008 ) .",
    "these are also ulirgs , but with a much larger molecular content , and a time - scale to consume their gas of @xmath11 2 gyr .",
    "they are extended 10kpc disks , and their co excitation is low , peaking at co(3 - 2 ) like the milky way .",
    "another star forming bzk galaxy however was not detected by hatsujade et al ( 2009 ) , and certainly , they have a wide range of properties . due to their low excitation",
    ", it might be appropriate to use a higher co - to - h@xmath0 conversion ratio than for ulirgs ( dannerbauer et al 2009 ) .",
    "smg are much more concentrated , more compact , they are expected to be major mergers remnants , with low angular momentum , and precursors of elliptical galaxies ( bouche et al 2007 ) .",
    "do they actually trace massive haloes ? in the goods - n field , a cluster of radio galaxies and smg at z=1.99 has been studied , it is the strongest known association of smg ( chapman et al 2008 ) , with an overdensity of 10 .",
    "smg appear also to be associated to filaments traced by lyman alpha emitters ( lae ) . in ssa22 , a protocluster region at z=3.1 ,",
    "traces a filament , where smg have been detected at 1.1 mm with aztec on aste ( tamura et al 2009 ) .",
    "smg are also sometimes associated to another type of objects , lyman - alpha blobs ( lab , geach et al 2007 ) , huge ionised gas nebulae , excited by a central starburst or agn . in local clusters at z=0.4 - 1 , such as cl0024 + 16 , the lirgs detected by spitzer at 24@xmath5 m can be detected in co ( geach et al 2009 ) .",
    "the fact that at high redshift , most detected objects are quasars , allows to study the agn - starbutst association , and possible agn feedback on co emission .",
    "for instance ,",
    "apm08279 + 5255 at z=3.9 is a lensed qso , ( amplification factor  50 ) , and one of the brightest object in the sky ; it has been observed with mm and cm telescopes , the co lines from co(1 - 0 ) to co(11 - 10 ) are detected .",
    "recent 0.3 \" resolution co(1 - 0 ) mapping with the vla ( riechers et al 2009 ) , reveals that the emission is not extended , as previously thought .",
    "the amplification factor could also be lower .",
    "the co line emission is co - spatial with optical / nir and x - rays , and very compact .",
    "the best model shows that the co is in a circumnuclear disk of 550 pc radius , inclined by 25@xmath12 , with a gas mass of 1.3 10@xmath3 m@xmath2 .",
    "there is no hint of the influence of the agn feedback .",
    "about 50 systems are presently detected in molecular lines at high redshift . given the different properties of the various categories of objects , it becomes obvious that results are dominated by selection effects .",
    "ulirgs have a very efficient star formation , their molecular gas has a compact distribution , and is highly excited .",
    "but bzk objects have much more extended gas , with normal star formation efficiency and consumption time - scales .",
