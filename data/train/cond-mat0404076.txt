    "the vanadium - based ladder compounds nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1  are interesting examples of systems where charge , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom are coupled to each other . like materials with magnetically active cu ions forming ladder - like structures,@xcite",
    "they show unusual physical properties due to a strong interaction of all degrees of freedom .",
    "the main building block of their unit cells is a ladder formed by v - o rungs and v - o legs , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] .",
    "both materials crystallize in the orthorhombic space group @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) with two formula units per unit cell .",
    "o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "( a )  the view along the ladders , ( b ) the view from the top .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to relatively weak bonds between the ladders .",
    "x indicates either na or ca , respectively.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    electrons in these systems can move within a rung , between rungs within a ladder , and between different ladders .",
    "the upper occupied electron states are formed by @xmath7 electrons of v with a slight admixture of oxygen @xmath8 orbitals . in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "one @xmath7 electron of v is shared by two sites within a rung which leads to a quarter - filled character@xcite and makes this compound a dielectric , since the hopping of an electron between two rungs , which would produce a doubly occupied and an empty rung , requires more energy than can be provided by the hopping matrix element along the ladders . at a critical temperature @xmath9 close to 35 k ,",
    "nav@xmath0o@xmath1  undergoes a transition to a spin - gapped state , as first reported by isobe and ueda in ref .",
    "based on the analysis of magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "evidence for such a transition was also obtained in raman scattering experiments.@xcite this behavior , in some aspects analogous to the spin - peierls transition observed in the inorganic chain compound cugeo@xmath10 at @xmath11  k , @xcite is accompanied by a disproportion of the v charges ( @xmath12 ) , a relatively large lattice distortion , and the formation of an ordered charge pattern . at @xmath13 the ions are displaced from their equilibrium positions in the high - temperature phase by distances of the order of 0.05  .",
    "these displacements which give evidence for a strong electron - lattice coupling have been observed in x - ray diffraction@xcite and can be estimated from infrared @xcite and raman scattering experiments.@xcite they stabilize the zig - zag ordered phase,@xcite being probably the crucial element that determines the physics of the charge ordering in this compound . at the same time , the coupling to dynamical phonons induces strong charge fluctuations near @xmath9 which alter the spin - spin exchange @xmath14.@xcite also the ordering is not completely static , even at low temperatures , since it is influenced by lattice vibrations , as was found in electron spin - resonance experiments.@xcite at the same time , one could expect that charge ordering accompanied by a lattice distortion will show up , for example , in the dielectric function with decreasing temperature .",
    "however , a comparison of optical spectra taken at the low- and high - temperature phase , respectively , exhibits only small differences below @xmath9,@xcite while raman spectra reveal large changes in the electronic background and show many new peaks which could have either magnetic or phononic origin when going below @xmath9.@xcite new peaks are also clearly seen in the low - temperature infrared spectra.@xcite a full understanding of these new modes is still lacking .    in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "each v ion has spin @xmath15 and it can therefore be described by a generalized heisenberg model of the spin - spin interaction . in this case , phonons directly influence the exchange constants , and , therefore , lead to a modification of the magnetic properties .",
    "the spin gap in this compound , arising due to different exchange along the legs and along the rungs , is of the order of 500  k ( 0.05  ev).@xcite we mention that the heisenberg spin - spin exchange parameters and , in turn , the strength of spin - phonon coupling depend on the electron on - site energies and the hopping matrix elements which form the bandstructure and influence the dielectric function .",
    "for this reason , the experimental and theoretical investigation of the optical conductivity , the lattice dynamics , and the electron - phonon and spin - phonon coupling can provide a clue to the properties of nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1  and shed light on the origin of the phase transition in the former .",
    "nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1  have been the subject of intensive theoretical investigations , both by first principles based on density functional theory ( dft ) and by model calculations.@xcite in first - principles calculations , the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method@xcite in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) and the linear combination of atomic orbitals @xcite ( lcao ) approach , which directly included the hubbard repulsion on the v sites , were applied to investigate the bandstructure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "more recently , mazurenko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite combined dft calculations with dynamical mean field theory aiming at understanding the insulating behavior of this compound in the high - temperature phase .",
    "the tight - binding lmto method was also applied to cav@xmath0o@xmath1  to obtain the spin exchange and effective four - band tight - binding model parameters for this compound.@xcite in addition , approaches based on quantum chemistry @xcite have been applied to nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "an interesting feature of the approaches used in refs .   and",
    "is that being based on the strong coupling of v and o1-@xmath16 orbitals , they attribute the phase transition to the ordering of the spin rather than the charge subsystem .",
    "while the bandstructures of nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1  are rather well understood on the first - principles basis , the analysis of their optical properties , lattice dynamics , electron - phonon coupling and raman scattering still rely on various model assumptions . having been well investigated experimentally , these properties require a detailed theoretical treatment which does not depend on such assumptions . moreover , the outcome of dft calculations is further used as realistic input parameters for model calculations such as quantum monte carlo or exact diagonalization techniques.@xcite    as far as nav@xmath0o@xmath1  is concerned , in this paper we concentrate on the high - temperature phase where v ions in the rungs are equivalent .",
    "this enables us to understand its main properties and provides a starting point for the investigation of the low - temperature phase .",
    "since in cav@xmath0o@xmath1  no structural phase transition is observed , our treatment there holds at any temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe the method of calculation and present the bandstructure for nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1  and related results like the density of states and the charge density .",
    "we provide the calculated dielectric tensor components @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for these two compounds in section iii .",
    "section iv includes theoretical phonon frequencies and eigenvectors , as well as electron - phonon and spin - phonon coupling parameters .",
    "the phonon - induced changes in the dielectric function and the corresponding phonon raman spectra will be presented in section v. finally , a summary of the results and suggestions for further investigations are given in the conclusions .",
    "all bandstructure calculations are performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using the full - potential augmented planewaves + local orbitals ( fp - apw+lo ) @xcite formalism implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite exchange and correlation terms are described within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite the atomic sphere radii are chosen as 1.6  a.u .  for v , 1.4  a.u .  for the o atoms and na , and 1.5  a.u .  for ca . in both compounds ,",
    "all atomic positions have been relaxed starting from the experimentally measured ones as given in ref .   for cav@xmath0o@xmath1   and ref .",
    "for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 . in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , for example , the shifts of the ions due to the relaxation of the structure are up to approximately 0.015    ( for o1 and o2 in @xmath19 direction ) with an energy gain of roughly 30  mev per unit cell .",
    "comparing the two materials , they have slightly different lattice constants and ion coordinates . for example , since v is less positively charged in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , the lengths of the v - o bonds are slightly larger than those in nav@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ". specifically , the optimized values for the v - o3 and v - o1 bond lengths are 1.62 ( 1.67 )   and 1.82 ( 1.85 )   in nav@xmath0o@xmath1   ( cav@xmath0o@xmath1 ) . at the same time , the spacing between ca and the o1 plane ( 2.39  ) is smaller than the na - o1 plane distance in nav@xmath0o@xmath1   ( 2.44  ) , since the bigger ca ion exhibits a stronger coulomb interaction with oxygen compared to na .",
    "the geometry relaxation allows to make the calculations not directly relying on the experimentally measured structural data and thereby leads to small quantitative differences compared to the nav@xmath0o@xmath1  calculations performed by smolinski _",
    "et al._@xcite at the same time , this provides the energy scale related to unit cell distortions as it is realized for example in the low - temperature phase",
    ".    we do not include correlational effects by using an lda+@xmath20 approach in our calculations , but we have estimated the hubbard @xmath20 for nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1  from our data by the following procedure . similarly to what is described in ref .  , we have added a small amount of electronic charge to the system and estimated @xmath20 from the resulting change of the v bands .",
    "charge neutrality was accounted for by two different procedures : when putting the positive charge on the na sites , the resulting @xmath20 was estimated to be 2.8  ev for nav@xmath0o@xmath1   ( averaged over the brillouin zone ( bz ) ) in good agreement with smolinski _",
    "et al._@xcite we preferred , however , to provide the positive charge in terms of a uniform background , which leads to a @xmath20 value of 2.45 ev for both compounds , demonstrating that @xmath20 only weakly depends on the ion s surrounding .",
    "this procedure has the advantage , that the band energy shifts are much more uniform with respect to different @xmath21 points of the bz than when the additional positive charge is located at the na sites ( differences of hundredths of an ev in the former case compared to tenths of an ev in the latter case ) .",
    "o@xmath1.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    o@xmath1.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the bandstructures and densities of states of nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1  are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bs_na ] and [ fig : bs_ca ] , respectively . focusing on nav@xmath0o@xmath1  first",
    ", the bands 3 - 4  ev below the fermi level are due to o-@xmath8 states . their smallest distance to the valence band minimum ( at the @xmath22 point ) will be denoted as @xmath23 later in the text .",
    "the unoccupied states exhibit mainly v character with a small admixture of oxygen .",
    "the bands intersecting the fermi level in @xmath24 direction are formed by the bonding combination of v orbitals .",
    "their dispersion is due to hopping along the ladders while the splitting of this pair of bands at the @xmath22 point is due to inter - ladder hopping .",
    "the two bands just above the fermi level originate from the antibonding combination of v-@xmath7 states .",
    "the situation for cav@xmath0o@xmath1  is similar , where some quantitative differences will be discussed below and in the context of its optical properties .",
    "the bands can be mapped onto a tight - binding model with the one - ladder parameters @xmath25 of the in - rung hopping , and @xmath26 representing the hopping along the ladder .",
    "the theoretically determined values for nav@xmath0o@xmath1  are @xmath27",
    "ev and @xmath28  ev , which is close to the data of ref .  .",
    "for cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , we obtained in the same way @xmath29  ev and @xmath30  ev , in agreement with the results of korotin _ et al._@xcite who applied the lda+@xmath20 technique in their calculations .",
    "compared to their results , our hopping matrix elements are slightly increased , which is due to the changes in the interatomic distances as a result of the structural relaxation .",
    "we note that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are smaller for cav@xmath0o@xmath1  than for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 . at the same time , the splitting of the _ bonding _ bands in the @xmath22 point arising from the inter - ladder hopping is much larger in cav@xmath0o@xmath1   ( 0.49 ev ) than in nav@xmath0o@xmath1   ( 0.23 ev ) since the distance between the ladders is smaller in the former .",
    "the corresponding inter - ladder hopping matrix elements between the closest v atoms of neighboring ladders , @xmath31 , are 0.13 and 0.24  ev for nav@xmath0o@xmath1  and cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "when the lattice is deformed by a displacement of ions corresponding to a phonon mode , the tight - binding parameters as well as the on - site energies change .",
    "this kind of electron - phonon coupling will be discussed below .",
    "the influence of the hubbard term @xmath20 on the properties of v - based ladder compounds is widely discussed in the literature .",
    "it is important to mention that the enhanced electron correlation when accouted for by the hubbard parameter reproduces the semiconducting behavior with the charge gap close to @xmath32 .@xcite correspondingly , the dispersion along the @xmath33-axis of the band derived from the bonding combination of v-@xmath7 orbitals will be @xmath34 rather than @xmath35 periodic.@xcite at the same time , we shall see below that the physical properties determined by the electron density , are not strongly influenced by the hubbard repulsion and can be described reliably within dft .",

    "[ fig : e_dens ] in two perpendicular planes .",
    "the upper panel clearly shows the role of the unit cell asymmetry on the charge density arising due to the presence of the apical oxygen o3 .",
    "this asymmetry , on the one hand , leads to a strong holstein - like electron - phonon coupling , and , on the other hand , diminishes the overlap of the v orbitals with o1 and o2 states , thus decreasing the hopping matrix elements and correspondingly the components of the dielectric tensor .",
    "in addition , the lower panel shows the preferred orientation of the in - ladder oxygen states and a relatively small overlap of the orbitals from different ladders .",

    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figures [ fig : epsilon_na ] and [ fig : epsilon_ca ] present the real and imaginary parts of the diagonal dielectric tensor components , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , in the experimentally measured range , where the cartesian index @xmath44 corresponds to the light polarization directions .",
    "@xmath43 was calculated within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , based on the kohn - sham orbitals including a life - time broadening of the optical inter - band transitions of @xmath45 ev , while @xmath42 is obtained by kramers - kronig transformation .",
    "let us first discuss the in - plane response of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the most interesting feature of the @xmath46 component ( light polarized along the rungs ) is a strong peak at 1.03  ev in agreement with experiment.@xcite an analysis of the interband momentum matrix elements at different electron wavevectors @xmath24 shows that the first peak in the @xmath46 response arises due to transitions between the bonding and antibonding band states within one v rung .",
    "the energy of the peak is larger than 2@xmath25 because of the band dispersion along the @xmath33 axis and can be estimated to be 2@xmath47 , which is 1.12  ev .",
    "since the transitions between @xmath7 orbitals have very small matrix elements due to the large v - v distance , the admixture of o1-@xmath16 states in the antibonding state is responsible for a sizable intrarung transition matrix element .",
    "we mention here that this admixture provides some support to the arguments of refs .   and .",
    "it rapidly decreases , however , with the increase of @xmath24 due to the corresponding decrease of the oxygen contribution , which was first noticed in ref .  .",
    "for this reason the peak mostly originates from transitions in the vicinity of the @xmath22 point .",
    "the @xmath48 component ( light polarized along the legs ) is dominated by a double - peak structure at 1.27  ev and 1.78  ev , respectively .",
    "it is considerably weaker than the @xmath46 response .",
    "the analysis of the bandstructure reveals that the shoulder at 1.3  ev comes from in - rung transitions .",
    "these can contribute to @xmath49 since at finite @xmath50 values the in - rung states are neither odd nor even with respect to the @xmath51 transformation , and , therefore , can couple to light polarized along the @xmath33-axis .",
    "the broad maximum at @xmath52  ev is related to transitions from the bonding v-@xmath7 states to o2-@xmath53 states admixed to v-@xmath54-derived orbitals at approximately 1.7  ev above the fermi level .    in both polarizations , the peaks occurring at higher energies ( @xmath55  ev ) originate from transitions between o-@xmath8 and v orbitals .",
    "for example , the broad feature around 3 ev in the @xmath46 spectra arises from transitions between o1-@xmath56 states at -3.3 ev and bonding v-@xmath7 states around @xmath57 . comparing to experiment",
    ", we want to point out that all theoretically obtained features reproduce the corresponding experimental findings very well.@xcite    in cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , the character of the transitions is , in general , the same as in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the fact that ca provides one more valence electron to the system compared to na has two obvious effects : first , the optical response is stronger compared to nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "second , the peak present in nav@xmath0o@xmath1  around 3  ev is missing , since the bonding v-@xmath7 states are occupied and thus do nt provide final states for the transitions . at the same time , since the in - ladder hopping matrix elements are smaller in cav@xmath0o@xmath1  than in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , the spectrum of unoccupied band states in cav@xmath0o@xmath1  is denser , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : bs_na ] and  [ fig : bs_ca ] . for this reason ,",
    "the low - energy part of the dielectric function ( @xmath58 ev ) of cav@xmath0o@xmath1   shows a more complicated @xmath59 dependence than that for nav@xmath0o@xmath1  since more interband transitions are allowed at this spectral range .",
    "a comparison with experiment for this compound which can also provide an experimental test of the applicability of the dft for the description of optical properties of half - filled ladder compounds is not possible at present since to the best of our knowledge no measured data of the dielectric function of cav@xmath0o@xmath1  single crystals are available .",

    "for example , the large phonon - induced decrease of @xmath90 in the 512  @xmath71 vibration of nav@xmath0o@xmath1  is a consequence of the larger v - o distance in the same leg ( see fig .",

    "the energy difference of the v and o1 orbitals is increased , diminishing the hopping parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the very strong modulation of the inter - ladder hopping @xmath92 by the 512  @xmath71 mode is due to a zig - zag like deformation of the legs in the @xmath37 plane , i.e.  a vibration of neighboring vanadium and oxygen atoms of one leg in opposite direction , and hence an increase of this v - o@xmath0 distance .",
    "as can be seen in tables  [ tab : parameters_na ] and [ tab : parameters_ca ] , the biggest change for both @xmath90 and @xmath74 , in nav@xmath0o@xmath1  is caused by the v - o2 stretching mode , while in cav@xmath0o@xmath1  this mode leads to the most pronounced change only in @xmath90 , but the largest modulation of @xmath74 is due to the v - o1-v mode ( 446  @xmath71 ) .",

    "the raman scattering intensity is governed by the change of the crystal polarizability with the nuclei vibrating around their equilibrium positions .",
    "the dependence of the dielectric function on the phonon coordinate arises due to two main reasons , i.e.  the @xmath79 dependence of the momentum matrix element and the @xmath79-dependence of the interband transition energy.@xcite the latter contribution leads to a stronger resonance behavior of the raman intensity than the former . to illustrate the influence of the lattice vibrations on the dielectric function , in fig .",

    "the latter shows a dramatic resonance behavior for the 232  @xmath71 and the 308  @xmath71 vibration , and is comparable or even slightly larger in magnitude than @xmath111 around 2  ev for the next three modes higher in energy . all modes but the highest one exhibit extremely strong resonances in the infrared in either of the two polarizations . for the highest mode ,",
    "the @xmath105 polarization is dominating , while only below 2  ev the @xmath48 component becomes more pronounced .",

    "a similarly strong resonance behaviour is also expected for cav@xmath0o@xmath1 . while with the exception of the highest mode the intensities of the @xmath105 component are small and the influence of the photon energy is negligible in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , this scattering geometry is slightly richer for cav@xmath0o@xmath1 , with generally slightly higher relative intensities and an even more pronounced resonant behavior of the highest mode .",
