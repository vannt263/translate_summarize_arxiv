    "we combine channels with electrons and muons ( both charge combinations ) in the final state .",
    "we also make use of the approximate symmetry of the cross sections under the transformation  ( [ eq : trans ] ) and define the @xmath3-quark charge to be @xmath162 .",
    "confidence levels calculated for @xmath163 will thus automatically apply for a charge @xmath5 quark which decays into a @xmath3-quark and a @xmath164 .",
    "our calculation does not include qcd corrections which are expected to modify the cross section by @xmath165 . in order to derive realistic limits ,",
    "we therefore allow for a normalization uncertainty of @xmath166 of the sm cross section .",
    "the expression for @xmath160 which is then used to compute confidence levels is given by  @xcite @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the number of bins , @xmath169 is the number of events for a given @xmath170 , and @xmath171 is the number of events in the sm in the @xmath101th bin .",
    "@xmath172 reflects the uncertainty in the normalization of the sm cross section within the allowed range , and is determined by minimizing @xmath160 : @xmath173 with @xmath174 in table  [ tab : two ] we display the resulting 95% confidence level limits for @xmath170 expected from the tevatron run  ii for an integrated luminosity of 20  fb@xmath4 , and from the lhc for 10  fb@xmath4 .",
    "the last row shows the combined limits from the three individual distributions studied here .",
    "possible backgrounds are assumed to be subtracted . at both the tevatron and the lhc , the @xmath122 and @xmath161 distributions in the combined radiative top decay regions",
    "yield rather similar limits for @xmath170 .",
    "as mentioned before , @xmath1 production at the tevatron is completely dominated by @xmath117 annihilation and photon radiation from the initial state quarks limits the sensitivity of the cross section to @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the bounds which can be achieved at the tevatron from analyzing the photon @xmath105 distribution in the phase space region defined by the @xmath1 selection cuts are significantly weaker than those which can be obtained from either the @xmath122 or the @xmath161 distribution in the combined radiative top decay regions .",
    "distributions more than those for the photon @xmath105 . ] at the lhc , most of the @xmath1 cross section originates from gluon fusion , and the limits from the photon @xmath105 distribution for @xmath116 selection cuts are similar to those which can be achieved in the phase space regions where radiative top decays dominate .",
    "while a precise measurement of the top quark charge will not be possible in run  ii of the tevatron , even with an integrated luminosity of 20  fb@xmath4 , we note that a charge @xmath5 top quark can be ruled out at @xmath6 c.l . when the limits from the different distributions and phase space regions are combined . at the lhc , with 10  fb@xmath4",
    ", a measurement of the top quark charge with an accuracy of about 10% appears to be feasible . as we pointed out in sec .",
    "ii , the @xmath105 cuts we use are suitable for running at low luminosity at the lhc , i.e. for @xmath175 . at high luminosity , @xmath176 , the transverse momentum cuts must be increased due to pile - up effects caused by the large number of interactions per beam crossing .",
    "the @xmath41 cross section is quite sensitive to these cuts .",
    "for example , increasing the @xmath105 cut of the @xmath3-quarks to 30  gev and the photon , jet and missing @xmath105 cuts to 50  gev reduces the @xmath1 and @xmath140 cross sections by a factor @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively .",
    "it is thus not clear whether running at high luminosity will improve the measurement of the top quark electric charge at the lhc .",
    "the bounds on @xmath170 are in general quite sensitive to @xmath179 .",
    "if the normalization uncertainty can be reduced to @xmath180 , the limits listed in table  [ tab : two ] can be improved by up to a factor  2 .",
    "further improvements may result from using more powerful statistical tools than the simple @xmath160 test we performed .    for integrated luminosities smaller than 20  fb@xmath4 at the tevatron",
    ", the limited number of events makes a detailed analysis of differential cross sections difficult . in this case",
    ", the ratio of the cross section associated with radiation in top production to the radiative decay cross section , @xmath181 , may be more useful .",
    "many experimental and theoretical uncertainties , for example , those associated with the particle detection efficiencies , the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity , or the uncertainties from the choice of scale or of the parton distribution functions , are expected to cancel , at least partially , in @xmath181 .",
    "the cross section ratio is quite sensitive to @xmath20 . from the individual cross sections listed in table  [ tab : one ] one finds @xmath182 for @xmath114 , and @xmath183 for @xmath115 at the tevatron . for an integrated luminosity of 10  fb@xmath4 ,",
    "the expected statistical uncertainty at the tevatron is @xmath184 and a charge @xmath5 top quark can thus be ruled out at @xmath185  c.l . using the cross section ratio , if one ignores possible systematic uncertainties . at the lhc ,",
    "the value of @xmath181 is even more sensitive to @xmath20 than at the tevatron , but enough events are expected to allow a more detailed analysis .",
    "like most of its fundamental quantum numbers , the electric charge of the top quark has not been measured so far .",
    "alternative interpretations for the particle we believe is the charge @xmath7 isospin partner of the @xmath3-quark are thus not ruled out .",
    "for example , since the correlations of the @xmath3-quarks and the @xmath8-bosons in @xmath186 are not determined , it is conceivable that the `` @xmath45-quark '' observed at the tevatron is an exotic quark , @xmath19 , with charge @xmath5 which decays via @xmath187 .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with current precision electroweak data  @xcite . in order to determine the charge of the top quark",
    ", one can either measure the charge of the @xmath3-jet , or investigate photon radiation in @xmath0 events .",
    "the latter method actually measures a combination of the em coupling strength and the charge quantum number .",
    "combining the results of the two methods will thus make it possible to determine both quantities .    in this paper",
    "we have explored the possibility of measuring @xmath20 in @xmath188 , assuming that both @xmath3-quarks are tagged .",
    "our analysis makes use of both @xmath1 production and radiative top quark decays , and is carried out at the tree level .",
    "the em coupling strength is assumed to take its sm value .",
    "top quark and @xmath8 boson decays are treated in the narrow width approximation .",
    "contributions from radiative @xmath8 decays can be suppressed by simple phase space cuts ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : radw ] ) ) .",
    "the remaining event sample can be separated into a @xmath1 sample , a @xmath25 , @xmath189 sample , and a @xmath25 , @xmath190 sample by imposing invariant mass and cluster transverse mass cuts ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : top51 ] )   ( [ eq : top7 ] ) ) .    in the phase space region dominated by @xmath1 production , the cross section increases if the magnitude of @xmath20 increases . at the tevatron , @xmath117 annihilation dominates and photon radiation off the incoming quarks constitutes an irreducible background which limits the sensitivity to @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , at the lhc , gluon fusion dominates , and the @xmath1 cross section scales approximately with @xmath118 .    in the phase space regions which enhance @xmath0 production with one of the top quarks decaying radiatively ( @xmath78 ) , interference effects between the feynman diagrams where",
    "the photon is emitted from the top quark , the @xmath8 boson and the @xmath3-quark line may cause the cross section to either decrease or increase with @xmath191 .",
    "for example , for @xmath115 , the @xmath192 cross section via radiative top quark decays is reduced by a factor of @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "the changes in the individual cross sections are reflected in the photon transverse momentum distribution in the various phase space regions .",
    "we also found that the @xmath143 distribution , where @xmath144 is the @xmath3 or @xmath97-quark with the smaller @xmath105 , is sensitive to the charge of the top quark in the phase space regions dominated by @xmath0 production where one of the top quarks decays radiatively .    in order to determine",
    "how well one can hope to measure the top quark charge using photon radiation in top quark events in future tevatron and lhc experiments , we have performed @xmath160 tests of the @xmath122 and the @xmath143 distributions in the various phase space regions of interest . at the tevatron , with an integrated luminosity of 20  fb@xmath4",
    ", one will be able to exclude at @xmath6  c.l .",
    "the possibility that an exotic quark @xmath19 with charge @xmath5 and not the sm top quark has been found in run  i. for smaller integrated luminosities , the number of events expected is very small and it will be difficult to perform a quantitative analysis using differential cross sections . in this case , the ratio of the cross section associated with radiation in top production to the radiative decay cross section may be a useful tool . at the lhc with 10  fb@xmath4 obtained at @xmath175 , it should be possible to measure the electric charge of the top quark with an accuracy of about 10% . for comparison , at a linear collider with @xmath195  gev and @xmath196  fb@xmath4 ,",
    "one expects that @xmath20 can also be measured with a precision of about 10%  @xcite .",
    "finally , at a @xmath197 collider it is conceivable that the top quark charge can be determined with an accuracy of better than 1% , if the @xmath24 cross section can be measured with a precision of 2%  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the electric charge of the top quark at the tevatron using photon radiation in top quark events is severely limited by statistics .",
    "even with an integrated luminosity of 20  fb@xmath4 , @xmath20 can only be determined with a precision of @xmath198 . however , as we pointed out in sec .",
    "i , information on the electric charge of the top quark may also be obtained from a measurement of the charge of the @xmath3-jets , and the charge sign of the leptons in semileptonically tagged @xmath3-quarks .",
    "this may significantly improve the precision which can be obtained .",
