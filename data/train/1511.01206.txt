    "the debris of the stellar object will be accreted onto the black hole ( bh ) , producing flaring emission in x - ray , ultraviolet , and optical . a typical @xmath5 behavior of the observed luminosity tracking the fallback rate evolution of the stellar debris , is a distinctive feature of tdes ( rees 1988 ; evans & kochanek 1989 ; phinney 1989 ) .",
    "the detection of sw j1644 + 57 at @xmath6 suggested that at least some tdes can launch a relativistic jet towards earth , which is manifested as a super - eddington x - ray burst ( bloom et al .",

    "the last point at @xmath12 days drops significantly below the extension of such a power - law .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve is similar to that of sw j1644 + 57 ( burrows et al .",
    "2011 ; zauderer et al .",
    "2013 ) , but with less variability observed .",
    "the hard x - ray emission was suggested to come from a corona forming around the accretion flow close to the bh ( nikolajuk & walter 2013 ) . the drastic decay at late time is attributed to a significant drop of the accretion rate , or more specifically , when the inner disk changes from the advective state to the gas - pressure - dominated state ( shen & matzner 2014 ) . the fast decline of the x - ray emission suggests that it has a central engine origin instead of the shocks due to the jet - medium interaction which predicts a much shallower decay ( zauderer et al .",
    "2013 ; wang et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the radio counterpart of the tde ( about one year after its x - ray peak ) was detected serendipitously by karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) in a nearby galaxy survey ( irwin et al .",
    "compared with the radio flux inferred from the vla observations taken years ago , the central compact source was brightened by more than a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "the radio spectral shape , peaking at ghz frequencies , and its variation suggest self - absorbed synchrotron emission with decreasing optical thickness ( irwin et al .",
    "the detection of the @xmath14 circular polarization and no significant linear polarization further supports this scenario ( beckert & falcke 2002 ; osullivan et al .",
    "the observational properties can be naturally explained by an expanding radio lobe , powered by interaction between a jet and a circum - nuclear medium ( cnm ) of the tde .",
    "however , the sub - eddington feature of the x - ray emission makes it different from sw j1644 + 57-like on - beam events .",
    "an attractive possibility is that this is the first off - beam jetted tde .",
    "an analytical model of the jet - cnm interaction to explain the radio emission characteristics has been proposed in irwin et al .",
    "the model is based primarily on order - of - magnitude estimates , especially for the interpretation of x - ray emission with the inverse compton ( ic ) counterpart of the synchrotron jet . in this work",
    ", we apply a relativistic jet model to study the radio and x - ray data of igr j12580 + 0134 , by self - consistently modeling the dynamical evolution of the jet and the synchrotron radiation properties of the electrons .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to the radio emission of sw j1644 + 57 ( wang et al .",
    "while the radio emission of igr j12580 + 0134 is found to be consistent with the external shock synchrotron emission in the newtonian regime , and the early x - ray emission could be from 1 ) the disk / corona , 2 ) the internal dissipation within the jet , and 3 ) the external shock . to satisfy the x - ray constraints , the on - beam internal jet dissipation and the external shock x - ray synchrotron emission need to be strongly suppressed , which implies that the tde has an off - beam jet .",
    "however , the shape of the x - ray lightcurve disfavors the external shock scenario due to the jet - cnm interaction .",
    "the internal dissipation may lead to strong variability as sw j1644 + 57 , which is not found in igr j12580 + 0134 .",
    "its x - ray luminosity and temporal behavior resemble those of typical non - jetted rosat tdes discovered in ngc 5905 .",
    "we therefore expect that the early x - ray emission is more likely of a disk / corona origin .",

    "the peak flux of the transient is @xmath15 ( nikolajuk & walter 2013 ) , corresponding to a brightening by a factor @xmath16 compared with the flux upper limit of the galaxy before the outburst ( fabbiano et al .",
    "the sharp onset and the subsequent power law decline with a slope consistent with @xmath17 suggest that the transient may be triggered by tidal disruption of a star or sub - stellar object by the smbh ( nikolajuk & walter 2013 ) .",
    "disruption of a star occurs when it comes to a bh closer than the tidal disruption radius @xmath18 , which is determined through equating the mean density of the volume enclosed by @xmath18 and the density of the star .",
    "the tidal disruption radius is then given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the bh , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass and radius of the star , respectively , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are normalized to solar values , and the black mass @xmath25 m@xmath26 is normalized to million solar masses .",
    "after the disruption , part of the stellar object is unbound .",
    "the bound part can lead to flaring electromagnetic emission when it is accreted onto the bh after making one more orbit back to pericenter .",
    "the time scale for the first main stream of disrupted materials ( those with the lowest energy ) to return to the pericenter is @xmath27 where the impact parameter @xmath28 , defined as the ratio of the tidal radius @xmath29 to the pericenter radius @xmath30 , describes the effective depth of the encounter .    assuming a `` flat '' mass distribution after the disruption , the rate at which materials with progressively higher energy to return to their respective orbital periastrons after one orbit is @xmath31 this defines the well - known `` fallback '' -5/3 law . here",
    "@xmath32 is the starting time of the tidal disruption , @xmath33 is the mass that falls back to pericenter , which is a fraction @xmath34 of the original mass of the disrupted object . by fitting the x - ray lightcurve of igr j12580 + 0134 with this @xmath17 power - law form , nikkolajuk & walter ( 2013 ) found that @xmath32 was around october 24 , 2010 .",

    "2000 ) . in the following calculation",
    "we adopt @xmath37 , and the impact parameter @xmath38 is adopted as unity .",
    "we now estimate the mass of the smbh in various ways .",

    "this sets an upper limit on the bh mass .",
    "there is also an empirical relation between such a qpo frequency and the smbh mass in active galactic nuclei ( agn ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; bian & huang 2010 ) : @xmath55 applying this relation to igr j12580 + 0134 , we obtain @xmath56",
    ".    an independent constraint on the bh mass can be obtained from the relation between the b - band luminosity of the bulge and the smbh mass ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "the bulge luminosity of ngc 4845 ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ) results in a bh mass of @xmath57 .",
    "another empirical relation among the radio luminosity at 5 ghz , x - ray luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band , and the smbh mass @xmath58 ( mller & gltekin 2011 ) gives a rough estimate of the smbh mass of @xmath59 . using the relationship between the bh mass and the normalized x - ray excess variance , nikolajuk & walter ( 2013 ) found a mass of @xmath60 m@xmath61 .",
    "using the the relation between the luminosity and width of @xmath62 emission ( greene & ho 2005 ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ) , we find a lower limit of the smbh mass of @xmath63 m@xmath61 .",

    "the potential qpo observed in x - rays ( nikolajuk & walter 2013 ) provides additional hint that the x - ray emission may be related to the accretion disk instead of the jet .",
    "we note that the last _ swift _ point at @xmath12 days is not too far away from the external shock model expectation .",
    "a deep observation by chandra or nustar may detect the external shock synchrotron x - ray component .",
    "the nearby tde igr j12580 + 0134 , discovered in x - rays by _ integral _ and then detected in radio by jvla , likely launched a relativistic jet . in this work ,",
    "we establish a dynamical jet evolution model to interpret the radio observations of the source , and derive constraints on the physical parameters of the tde with multi - wavelength data .",
    "we find that the bh mass is in the range @xmath164 , and the mass of the disrupted star is in the range @xmath91 or @xmath165 jupiter mass .",
    "the radio lightcurves and multiband spectra can be well explained by the synchrotron emission from the external shock of the jet , in good agreement with the conclusion reached by irwin et al .",
    "the turn - over in the spectra is due to the synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the evolution of the peak frequency and the in - band spectral index can be well explained within the jet model .",
    "similar to sw j1644 + 57 , the x - ray emission shows distinctive behavior at late time compared with the expectation of the external shock synchrotron emission from the jet - cnm interaction , which suggests a non - external - shock origin .",
    "taking sw j1666 + 57 as a template , we find that the expected internal jet emission would outshine the observed flux greatly .",
    "this suggests that the jet is off - beam . by requiring both the internal dissipation emission and the external shock x - ray fluxes not to exceed the observed values , we find that the initial lorentz factor @xmath166 a few and @xmath2 .",
    "our modeling therefore establishes igr j12580 + 0134 as the first tde with an off - beam relativistic jet .",
    "the upcoming high resolution mapping from the very long baseline array ( vlba ) will directly test this scenario and image the jet structure .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate a non - relativistic outflow model similar to that introduced by alexander et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for the radio emission in asassn-14li .",
    "we first model the radio data of igr j12580 + 0134 with a non - relativistic spherical outflow in a uniform cnm .",
    "we find that the data require a kinetic energy of @xmath167 and an initial velocity of @xmath168 .",
    "this model also needs a very high cnm density of @xmath169 to allow for a significant deceleration of the outflow at @xmath170 days .",
    "these parameters are not favored .",
    "we then consider an outflow model but with a circumnuclear gas density profile of @xmath171 .",
    "this model suggests a similar kinetic energy of @xmath172 , and an ejecta velocity of @xmath173 .",
    "however , due to the steep circumnuclear density profile , the outflow would undergo a coasting phase for years . as discussed in section 2.2 ,",
    "the disrupted object is around @xmath174 jupiter mass .",
    "if we take a typical mass @xmath175 , the outflow driven by the unbound tidal debris can then reach a velocity @xmath176 and a kinetic energy @xmath177 , both of which are much lower than the model requirements .",
    "also such a strong outflow is unlikely launched from a sub - eddington accretion disk .",
    "we therefore conclude that the off - beam relativistic jet model as proposed here is more natural to interpret the data of igr j12580 + 0134 .    in our modeling ,",
    "the observed flux for an off - beam jet is reduced by a factor of @xmath178 , assuming a point source ( see granot et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is a good approximation for a large view angle , @xmath179 , as is our case . for a near edge view",
    ", however , the correction on the flux would be @xmath180 .",
    "this effect should be considered when studying the detection rate of tdes ( e.g. sun et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "we find it difficult to use the ssc counterpart of the radio emission from the jet to interpret the observed x - ray data .",
    "the rapid drop of the x - ray flux at @xmath181 days suggests that the x - ray emission likely comes from the internal dissipation of the jet or the accretion disk instead of the forward shock .",
    "an on - beam geometry is also needed to account for the shape of the x - ray lightcurve within the ssc scenario , but such an on - beam geometry is disfavored by the lack of significant x - ray emission from the internal dissipation within the jet and the required very low lorentz factor .    the observed x - ray emission at 40 d @xmath182 d exhibits the power - law decay with the index @xmath183 , which is consistent with the predicted fallback rate of the standard tde model .",
    "in this model , the disk luminosity is proportional to the accretion rate : @xmath184 . a natural source of the x - ray emission",
    "is the disk / corona around the bh , either the standard thin disk , or the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model .",
    "however , the adaf model predicts @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the observations actually support the thin disk model .",
    "the existence of a corona near the thin disk also helps to facilitate the blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; lei et al .",
    "2005 ; lei et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is likely responsible for jet launching of other on - beam jetted tdes .",
    "based on the current model , we predict that the radio flux should be @xmath186 in l - band and @xmath187 in c - band at present .",
    "if the cnm density has a stratified structure or if the electron index steepens with time , one would expect a somewhat lower flux then this predicted value .",
