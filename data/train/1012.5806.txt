    "in this article we are interested in the numerical evaluation of @xmath15 $ ] for a sufficiently smooth function @xmath16 by monte carlo , via discretization and simulation of the process @xmath10 .",
    "we propose new weak approximation algorithms for and study their rate of convergence .",
    "the traditional method to simulate @xmath10 is to use the euler scheme with constant time step @xmath17 this method has the convergence rate @xcite @xmath18-e[f(\\hat x^n_1)]|\\leq \\frac{c}{n}\\ ] ] but suffers from two difficulties : first , for a general lvy measure @xmath6 , there is no available algorithm to simulate the increments of the driving lvy process and second , a large jump of @xmath0 occurring between two discretization points can lead to an important discretization error .    a natural idea due to rubenthaler @xcite ( in the context of finite - intensity jump processes , this idea appears also in @xcite ) , is to approximate @xmath0 with a compound poisson process by replacing the small jumps with their expectation @xmath19 and then place discretization dates at all jump times of @xmath20 .",
    "the computational complexity of simulating a single trajectory using this method becomes a random variable , but the convergence rate may be computed in terms of the _ expected _ number of discretization dates , proportional to @xmath21 . when the jumps of @xmath0 are highly concentrated around zero , however , this approximation is too rough and the convergence rates can be arbitrarily slow .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed a scheme which builds on rubenthaler s idea of using the times of large jumps of @xmath0 as discretization dates but achieves better convergence rates .",
    "their idea is , first , to approximate the small jumps of @xmath0 with a suitably chosen brownian motion , in order to match not only the first but also the second moment of @xmath0 , and second , to construct an approximation to the solution of the continuous sde between the times of large jumps .",
    "similar ideas of gaussian correction were recently used in @xcite in the context of multilevel monte carlo methods for the problem . however , although diffusion approximation of small jumps improves the convergence rate , there are limits on how well the small jumps of a lvy process can be approximated by a brownian motion . in particular , the brownian motion is a symmetric process , while a lvy process may be asymmetric .    in this paper",
    "we develop new jump - adapted discretization schemes based on approximating the lvy process @xmath0 with a finite intensity lvy process @xmath20 without diffusion part .",
    "contrary to previous works , instead of simply truncating jumps smaller than @xmath22 , we construct efficient finite intensity approximations which match a given number of moments of @xmath0 .",
    "these approximations are superior to the existing approaches in two ways .",
    "first , given that @xmath20 is a finite intensity lvy process , the solution to with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath20 is easy to compute , either explicitly or with a fast numerical method , making it straightforward to implement the scheme .",
    "second , by choosing the parameters of @xmath20 in a suitable manner , one can , in principle , match an arbitrary number of moments of @xmath0 and obtain a discretization scheme with an arbitrarily high convergence rate .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ pt.mmatch ] ,",
    "we present the main idea of moment matching approximations and provide a basic error bound for such schemes . in section [ pt.3mom ] , we introduce our first scheme which is based on matching 3 moments of @xmath0 and can be used for general lvy processes . for lvy processes with stable - like behavior of small jumps near zero , the scheme is shown to be rate - optimal .",
    "finally , section [ pt.highorder ] shows how schemes of arbitrary order can be constructed by matching additional moments , once again , in the context of lvy processes with stable - like behavior of small jumps .",
    "let @xmath20 be a finite intensity lvy process without diffusion part approximating @xmath0 in a certain sense to be defined later : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a poisson random measure with intensity measure @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .    in this paper",
    "we propose to approximate the process by the solution to @xmath27 which can be computed by applying the euler scheme at the jump times of @xmath20 and solving the deterministic ode @xmath28 explicitly ( or by a runge - kutta method ) between these jump times .",
