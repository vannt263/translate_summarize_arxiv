    "stored radioactive waste proliferated with the development of nuclear weapons . beginning with the manhattan project , and throughout the cold war , large quantities of radioactive waste were accumulated .",
    "most of this waste originated as a byproduct of uranium and plutonium production at the hanford and savannah river sites , and from the enrichment plant at oak ridge  @xcite . before the 1970s ,",
    "the composition of this waste was poorly documented , and significant quantities of liquid waste were released directly to the environment  @xcite . only the most highly radioactive fraction of the waste was piped to underground storage tanks .    at savannah river , @xmath0 million gallons of high level waste are stored in @xmath1 underground tanks  @xcite .",
    "processing and immobilization of high level waste in borosilicate glass started in @xmath2 .",
    "a salt waste processing facility is currently under construction , with first operations scheduled in @xmath3 .",
    "completion of clean - up activities is scheduled only by @xmath4  @xcite .    at hanford ,",
    "@xmath5 million gallons of waste were stored in @xmath6 underground tanks  @xcite . the oldest , single shell , tanks were built between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with designed service lives of @xmath9 to @xmath10 years .",
    "out of these @xmath6 tanks , @xmath11 have or are suspected to have leaked up to @xmath12 million gallon into the environment  @xcite , with first leaks confirmed in @xmath13 .",
    "double shell carbon - steel tanks were built starting in @xmath14 to provide better confinement .",
    "waste was then pumped from single shell to double shell tanks , yet , @xmath15 million gallons were still stored in single shell tanks in @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "moreover , leaks have also been discovered between shells of double shell tanks  @xcite .",
    "construction of a facility to immobilize the high level waste using similar approaches to those used at savannah river began in @xmath17 .",
    "however , due to various unresolved technical problems and work stoppages  @xcite , the estimated cost to construct this treatment and immobilization facility has tripled from @xmath18 to @xmath19 billion dollars , and its scheduled completion date slipped by nearly a decade to 2019  @xcite .",
    "completion of clean - up activities is not expected before 2050  @xcite .",
    "clean up efforts for all the waste sites are projected to cost more than @xmath20 billion dollars  @xcite .",
    "in essence , clean - up is a matter of separating small volumes of high activity waste from much larger volumes of low activity waste .",
    "the separated high activity waste is then immobilized as glass for ultimate disposal in an underground repository .",
    "the low activity waste is immobilized in a less durable wasteform for onsite disposal .",
    "the presence of significant volumes of non - radioactive elements inside the high - activity waste stream is costly .",
    "first , vitrifying non - radioactive material incurs the production cost of additional glass canisters , which is a significant fraction of the total clean - up cost , since each canister costs on the order of a million dollars @xcite .",
    "moreover , the larger number of glass canisters requires a greater number of vitrification facilities , increasing the capital cost .",
    "second , the glass formulation has specific weight loading tolerances for different elements  @xcite .",
    "for example , chromium , ruthenium , rhodium and palladium in the glass can precipitate and eventually short circuit the glass melter electrodes . furthermore , chromium , phosphorus oxide and sodium sulfate dissolve poorly in borosilicate glass , forming on occasions refractory crystalline phases that could compromise the durability of borosilicate glass wasteform .",
    "thus , the efficient separation of high - level radioactive elements from the low - level waste can lower significantly the cost of the clean - up  @xcite .",
    "it is the objective here to examine the practicality , or economic feasibility , specifically of plasma mass filtration techniques for nuclear waste clean - up . in doing so , it is our further objective to identify those tasks that might best be accomplished by plasma - based techniques when used together with other techniques .",
    "the utility of plasma - based techniques depends on the nature of the nuclear waste , which is often highly heterogeneous .",
    "it is also often the case that elements of very different atomic weights require separation .",
    "we will show that it is on these types of wastes that plasma techniques tend to be economically competitive .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : challenges ] , we examine the main challenges faced by waste tank clean - up operations . we take the hanford waste as an example , which illustrates certain limitations to chemical techniques . in section",
    "[ sec : plasma_filtering ] , we review the essential characteristics of plasma mass filtering techniques . in section",
    "[ sec : economics ] , we compare the projected costs of plasma techniques to costs for chemical techniques for the particular application of sludge pretreatment . in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize the main results .",
    "although conceptually simple , separating non - radioactive material from radioactive elements can prove to be extremely challenging . in the case of legacy waste analyzed here , the challenge arises from the heterogeneity of the input stream , both in terms of physical and chemical forms .",
    "waste stored in tanks is in one of three forms  @xcite . due to the high ph ,",
    "the bulk of the metals precipitate as insoluble metal oxides / hydroxides that gravity settles to form a thick layer referred to as _",
    "sludge_. typical metals include al , bi , cr , fe , mn , si and u. the liquid fraction of the waste , referred to as _ supernate _ , contains water - soluble components , principally the sodium salts of oxyanions including hydroxyde , nitrate , nitrite , aluminate , sulfate and carbonate .",
    "historically , the supernate has been evaporated to minimize the volume .",
    "cooling of the hot , concentrated supernate produced crystalline salts , which accumulated in a layer referred to as _",
    "saltcake_.    typical waste pretreatment operations can be summarized as follows  @xcite .",
    "the sludge is recovered and goes through a series of caustic leaching , oxydative leaching and washing steps to remove non - radioactive elements , in particular na , al and cr  @xcite .",
    "saltcake is dissolved in water and combined with supernates and liquids from sludge leaching and washing .",
    "undissolved solids are removed and the clarified liquids are treated to remove certain radionuclides such as @xmath21cs , @xmath22tc and @xmath23sr . the leached and washed sludge , together with the elements removed from the dissolved saltcake and supernate , are combined and vitrified . after the removal of the radionuclides , the decontaminated supernate is immobilized in either cementitious ( savannah river site ) or glass ( hanford site ) wasteform .    in the case of hanford ,",
    "the large waste compositional variations between tanks complicates the separation process  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : composition ] .",
    "the high level waste at hanford can be divided into six sub - groups based on their chemistry and glass formulation limiting factors  @xcite : high alumina wastes , high iron wastes , high iron , chromium , nickel and manganese wastes , high chromium and sulfur wastes , high phosphorus and calcium wastes , and high alkali wastes .",
    "removal of non radioactive elements by means of chemical techniques is then challenging , since the elements to be removed vary widely from batch to batch , and are usually a combination of elements with various chemical properties . as a result ,",
    "chemical separation ( _ e .",
    "g. _ aluminium in the chemical form of boehmite  @xcite , and chromium present as cr(iii ) compounds  @xcite ) has proven to be particularly difficult  @xcite .",
    "are plotted here . , width=529 ]    to avoid these difficulties , new glass formulation methods may allow higher aluminum and chromium fractions as well as higher waste loadings  @xcite .",
    "these methods may stem the increase of canisters resulting from larger volumes , but the glass formulation is difficult and still uncertain . the capability to accommodate",
    "typically encountered waste composition variations is yet to be demonstrated .",
    "in addition , higher aluminum content will most likely have detrimental side effects , notably on achievable processing rates  @xcite , and may call for different melter technology solutions  @xcite .    yet another approach is to reduce cost through pretreatment of the waste  @xcite . here",
    "non - chemical separation techniques are attractive since they are in principle indifferent to waste heterogeneity .",
    "one example of such a non - chemical technique is plasma mass filtering .",
    "the potential of plasma medium to separate elements based on their mass has long been recognized  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a device is the plasma centrifuge  @xcite , which operates in a similar fashion to conventional gaseous or liquid centrifuges , but offers higher separation factors due to its ability to operate at much larger rotation speeds .",
    "higher rotation speeds are in this case made possible by the absence of moving parts , with rotation produced in this device by means of the combined effects of electric and magnetic fields  @xcite . however , the main thrust for this research effort was originally isotope separation  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "most of the work was directed towards low mass differences and , consequently , low throughput .",
    "only recently has plasma mass filtering been considered for nuclear waste remediation  @xcite and for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing  @xcite .",
    "the use of plasmas for these new applications was made possible by the development of various new plasma filter concepts  @xcite which offer high - throughput processing granted sufficiently large mass differences between species to be separated  @xcite .    in these devices",
    ", material can be fed in the machine in different forms .",
    "possible candidates include powder injection or laser evaporation .",
    "although the choice of a particular feeding technique has not been made yet , and will most likely depend on the specifics of the targeted process , general constraints can be obtained for this particular process .",
    "for example , in the case of powder injection , micron - size particles are likely to be required for the envisioned plasma operating conditions  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the desired throughput will dictate the required laser power .",
    "once ionized , charged particles respond to both electromagnetic and centrifugal fields . in plasma filters devices ,",
    "these fields are generally designed such that there exists a mass threshold @xmath24 for particle confinement .",
    "elements heavier than the mass threshold @xmath24 are then directed one way , while elements lighter than this mass threshold are directed in another way .",
    "[ fig : plasma_filters ] illustrates the differential confinement properties of _ light _ and _ heavy _ elements for the three main filter concepts . in is worth noting here that variations on these concepts exist , such as the use of rf electric fields in place of dc electric fields controlling the plasma rotation .",
    "this could in principle allow isolating a particular mass from the bulk  @xcite , rather than discriminating elements based on a threshold mass .",
    "@xmath25    the two separated streams can then be recovered individually .",
    "depending on the selected filter concept , charged particles could be either deposited and neutralized on a surface , or neutralized in volume by locally tuning the plasma parameters .",
    "although different insertion points can be envisioned , the ability to separate a _ light population _ from a _ heavy population _ makes plasma filters attractive for sludge pretreatment .",
    "for example , for the typical sludge composition introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : challenges ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : compobymass ] , one can imagine tuning the plasma filter in such a way that al , cr , fe , o , na and si are below the cutoff mass , while sr , tc , cs , bi , th and u are heavier than the cutoff mass . as indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : plasma ] , the low volume , heavy stream , could then be processed as high activity waste and vitrified together with radionuclides recovered from the liquid waste , while the larger volume , light stream will be processed as low activity waste . the total waste mass below this cutoff mass , as summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab0 ] , gives an upper limit for the plasma treatment efficiency of @xmath26 to @xmath27 .    .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     overall , the total chemical sludge disposal cost stems essentially from vitrification and glass canister storage costs , while pretreatment costs are negligible in comparison .",
    "looking back at the chemical and plasma flowcharts in fig  [ fig : flowchart ] , one sees that a plasma approach would eliminate the secondary liquid waste stream ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the cost of plasma sludge disposal @xmath29 per unit mass of sludge is thus the sum of only two subprocesses , @xmath30 the first one is the vitrifying cost , where @xmath31 is the vitrification cost per unit mass of waste load , and @xmath32 is the mass of solid waste after plasma filtering .",
    "@xmath31 is identical to the one obtained for chemical separation and listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] , and only @xmath33 differs .",
    "the second one , @xmath34 , is the cost of plasma filtering per unit mass .",
    "this plasma filtering cost , can itself be broken down into different processes .",

    "[ sec : plasma_filtering ] , one option consists in laser evaporation . assuming that the latent heat of vaporization @xmath35 is dominant over both the latent heat of fusion and the enthalpy change due to the temperature increase , an firth order estimate for the evaporation cost @xmath36 is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the laser absorptivity . for an aluminum rich waste , @xmath39  @xcite and @xmath40mj / kg",

    "using once more aluminum as a baseline , this requires @xmath43mj / kg . this figure is again an ideal value . in practice",
    ", one has to account for all energy dissipation channels .",
    "first , part of the electron energy will be dissipated through excitation of neutrals and ions .",
    "a measure of the deviation from the ideal case is the efficiency @xmath44 , defined as the ratio of the energy required for one electron - ion pair creation over the atom ionization energy @xmath45 . for helicon discharges envisioned for this application",
    ", @xmath44 is about @xmath46 for an electron temperature @xmath47ev in pure argon ( @xmath48ev )  @xcite .",
    "however , the efficiency @xmath44 is expected to be reduced for the more complex compositions typically envisioned here .",
    "it is worth noting here that since excitation losses scale with the square of the plasma density , @xmath44 can in principle be maintained to acceptable levels by limiting the plasma density .",
    "in addition to electron losses , other energy dissipation channels might have to be considered depending on the plasma parameters .",
    "these includes the energy transfer to ions in the form of rotational kinetic energy and temperature .",
    "quantitatively , a mass of @xmath49 kg rotating at @xmath50km.s@xmath51 has a kinetic energy of @xmath52mj , and increasing the temperature of @xmath12  kg of aluminum gas by @xmath49ev requires @xmath53mj",
    ". these losses are therefore small in most cases compared to electron losses .",

    "[ [ total - cost ] ] total cost + + + + + + + + + +    summing up the costs of these two sub - processes , and assuming a low laser electric efficiency of @xmath55 , gives a plasma filtering energy cost of the order of @xmath56gj / kg . using a typical electricity cost of $ @xmath55 per kilowatt - hour ( kwh ) , _",
    "i.  e. _ @xmath57mj/$ , this puts the cost of plasma pretreatment @xmath58per kg of sludge .",
    "interestingly , this cost is on par with @xmath59 , the cost of sludge chemical washing and leaching .",
    "the absence of secondary liquid waste stream would represent a saving of about $ @xmath60 per kg of sludge .",
    "however , the largest opportunity to reduce costs lies in waste mass minimization . as a matter of fact",
    ", because of the significant costs associated with vitrification , a higher mass minimization @xmath61 could offer large savings .",
    "studies indicate high variations of chemical washing / leaching efficiency across the various tank farms  @xcite , with aluminum removal values ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "similar variations can be found for other elements of critical importance such as chromium and iron  @xcite , and studies targeted to one particular waste type showed comparable results  @xcite . as a consequence , non - radioactive elements are still largely responsible of the large mass of the processed sludge .",
    "improvements in the chemical processes are challenging since further washing / leaching puts additional constraints on the liquid waste stream , and because a given process might increase the performances with respect to one specific element while degrading the performances with respect to another . on the other hand ,",
    "a plasma mass filter could in principle offer on average higher efficiencies since all elements lighter than the mass threshold would be removed .    using the the typical waste subgroups compositions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : compobymass ] , one can produce waste mass minimization estimates for various separation schemes .",
    "three different separation processes are studied here .",
    "the first one consists simply in the removal of @xmath64 of the aluminum oxide contained in the sludge .",
    "the second one corresponds to an optimized chemical separation process  @xcite , with the removal of @xmath65 of al@xmath66o@xmath67 , @xmath63 of cr@xmath66o@xmath67 , @xmath68 of fe@xmath66o@xmath67 and @xmath69 of sio@xmath66 .",
    "the third one corresponds to a plasma filtering with a threshold mass @xmath70amu , and a given uniform separation efficiency for all oxides for which the non oxygen element is lighter than @xmath24 . in all three cases , sodium is assumed to be totally removed during the process .",
    "the corresponding results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : separation ] . as expected , there are large variations depending on waste composition , and that both for plasma and chemical techniques .",
    "performance is the worst for the high thorium and zirconium wastes ( sub - group b ) , which makes sense since these elements are not recovered by either of these processes . comparing chemical and plasma techniques",
    ", it appears that a moderate @xmath26 plasma filter separation efficiency leads to comparable or better results than the advanced chemical process .",
    "the advantage of plasma filtering decreases for high aluminum content wastes ( sub - groups e and f ) , since in this case the higher aluminum separation efficiency offered by chemical techniques addresses better the problem .",
    "however , a @xmath71 plasma filtering separation efficiency is sufficient to make the plasma approach more efficient than the chemical process modeled across all waste sub - groups .    ) as obtained by different pretreatment options and different plasma filtering efficiencies .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath32 denote the mass fraction of sludge after respectively plasma and chemical processing . ]",
    "waste mass minimization can be directly translated into cost savings using the typical vitrification cost per kg of processed sludge listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the cost difference per kg of sludge due to waste mass minimization is @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding data is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : savings ] , and suggests that savings of $ @xmath73 and higher per kg of sludge are possible for two third of the waste types and a @xmath26 plasma mass filtering efficiency . increasing the efficiency to @xmath64 yields savings of $ @xmath74 to $ @xmath75 per kg depending on the waste type .",
    "these values are substantial , representing @xmath76 to @xmath77 of the total sludge processing cost .",
    "it is worth noting here that a filtering efficiency of @xmath71 appears to be well within reach of the proposed plasma filter concepts  @xcite .",
    "however , if required , higher values could be achieved by staging the filter , so that particles go through multiple separation steps .",
    "three passes , each at an efficiency of @xmath71 , would offer a @xmath78 separation .",
    "this could ideally be achieved at negligible cost by maintaining elements ionized throughout the full cycle . even for the worst case scenario where particles have to be re - ionized",
    ", the cost per kg would not exceed two or three @xmath34 .",
    "this is about $ @xmath79 per kg , which would be lower than the savings achieved as a result of an improved waste mass minimization .    .",
    "a typical advanced chemical process  @xcite is used as the baseline for this comparison ( removal of @xmath65 al , @xmath63 cr , @xmath68 fe and @xmath69 si ) . @xmath80$/kg . ]    to summarize , the cost of plasma filtering appears to be about the same as the costs associated with chemical washing and leaching for sludge pretreatment .",
    "however , because no additional liquid waste produced , and because non - radioactive elements critical to the vitrification process are removed easily , plasma filtering may offer significant savings when considering the entire sludge pretreatment and vitrification process . .",
    "this is especially true for highly heterogeneous waste , such as legacy waste .",
    "the cost of plasma mass filtering was analyzed within the generally accepted framework in which the ultimate disposal of the nuclear waste consists of immobilization of the radioactive components in glass for permanent storage in a geological repository .",
    "however , the cost of vitrification rises with the waste mass , sometimes to a prohibitive level .",
    "this is especially true for legacy waste , that is to say nuclear waste produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons development during the cold war era , which is typically made of large volumes of non - radioactive material mixed with much smaller volumes of highly radioactive elements .",
    "disposal of this kind of waste hence requires efficient ways of separating radioactive and non - radioactive components , in order to minimize the mass of the high - activity fraction .    the large number of chemical elements present in the waste challenges chemical separation approaches .",
    "significant variations both in physical and chemical forms further challenges the chemical techniques .",
    "in contrast , plasma mass filtering techniques appear promising because of their ability to discriminate elements irrespective of their chemical composition . for applications to nuclear waste , plasma filtering can exploit the large mass gap existing between most of the non radioactive elements and the smaller fraction of radioactive elements .",
    "we estimated that , for hanford wastes , the processing costs for chemical and plasma filtering techniques are comparable .",
    "however , plasma processing could , in principle , provide for significantly higher reduction in the mass of the waste sent to the high - activity vitrification melter compared to chemical techniques .",
    "the reduction in high - activity waste would yield significant savings .",
    "for example , a plasma filter offering @xmath71 separation efficiency for the non - radioactive elements would decrease the overall cost by $ @xmath81 to $ @xmath82 per kg of sludge , which represents a @xmath83 to @xmath84 savings .",
    "in addition , as opposed to chemical washing and leaching , plasma sludge processing does not produce additional liquid waste that would require additional treatment .",
    "thus , our preliminary evaluation suggests the economic feasibility of plasma filtering for sludge pretreatment .",
    "it remains , however , to refine our cost comparison by including capital , operation and maintenance costs .",
    "it remains also to analyze how waste mass minimization offered by plasma filtering might be advantageously combined with advanced glass formulations for increased waste loadings and reduced number of glass canisters .",
