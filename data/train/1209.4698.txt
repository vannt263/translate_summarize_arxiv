    "in order to obtain it in the ir limit , one can deform the hl gravity by introducing a soft violation term as @xmath32 and taking the limit of @xmath23 as @xmath33 , which is called the `` deformed hl gravity '' . in the deformed hl gravity ,",
    "the uv properties are unchanged , whereas there exists a minkowski vacuum in the ir limit . in this case , the constants are given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath30 .",
