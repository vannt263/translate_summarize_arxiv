    "much has been learnt about the formation and evolution of our milky way galaxy from the system of globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "it is natural to extend such studies to the gc systems of other galaxies .",
    "there are several advantages in doing this : + @xmath0 greater numbers , eg the mw has only 150 known gcs , m31 has a total population of @xmath1 400 and m87 @xmath1 10,000 .",
    "+ @xmath0 probing to higher metallicity gcs .",
    "+ @xmath0 the local group has no giant ellipticals .",
    "+ @xmath0 no foreground stars in the gc spectra .",
    "+ @xmath0 discover something new !",
    "+ for local group studies ( d @xmath1 1 mpc ) , 3 - 6 m telescopes have collected optical and ir colours , and measured sizes for large numbers of gcs .",
    "spectra also exist in large numbers for v @xmath1 16 gcs , giving metallicities , abundances , relative ages and system kinematics .",
    "classic papers for local group gcs are those of brodie & huchra in 1990s ( eg brodie & huchra 1990 , 1991 ) more recently the 0.1@xmath2 resolution of hst has provided cmd morphologies for several local group gcs ( see various posters at this conference ) .    further afield ( eg virgo / fornax distance of 15 mpc ) 8 - 10 m telescopes are starting to obtain similar information for more distant gc systems .",
    "optical colours have now been measured for @xmath150 systems .",
    "ir colours are lagging behind but quickly catching up ( see posters by puzia and hempel ) . at 15 mpc ,",
    "gcs are partially resolved by hst allowing sizes to be measured ( eg larsen et al .",
    "typical mags of v @xmath1 22 have made obtaining high quality spectra ( for ages , abundances etc ) and large numbers for system kinematics slow going .",
    "only a handful of systems have good quality spectra for individual gcs ( the vast majority coming from the sages project . ) a database of imaging and spectral information for extragalactic gcs can be found at : astronomy.swin.edu.au/dforbes",
    "in our galaxy , the inner metal - rich gcs are now thought to be associated with the bulge rather than the disk ( minniti 1995 ) .",
    "recently forbes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) extended this view to other spiral galaxies .",
    "in particular , they showed that the mean metallicity , velocity dispersion , rotation velocity and spatial distribution of the inner metal - rich gcs in m31 and m81 supported a bulge origin .",
    "hst imaging of the gcs in the sombrero galaxy ( m104 ) revealed a large number of metal - rich gcs ( larsen , forbes & brodie 2001 ) .",
    "it seems highly unlikely that they are associated with the tiny disk but instead with the dominant bulge .",
    "a comparison of the number of metal - rich gcs with the bulge luminosity ( called ` bulge ' specific frequency ) in the mw , m31 and m104 suggests a near constant value of 1.0 .",
    "this can be compared to the specific frequency of red ( metal - rich ) gcs in field ellipticals which is 0.51.5 ( assuming that the elliptical is simply a large bulge ) .",
    "thus the ` bulge specific frequency ' for spirals and ellipticals are similar .",
    "some , perhaps all , large ellipticals are thought to have formed via the merger of spirals .",
    "it is thus interesting to ` merge ' together the gc systems of the local group galaxies to simulate a dissipationless ( ie no new gcs are formed ) merger .",
    "this merger is of course dominated by m31 ( sb ) and mw ( sbc ) .",
    "forbes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) carried out this exercise and found the total gc system of the lg elliptical to be 700 @xmath3 125 .",
    "the total luminosity was estimated to be m@xmath4 22.0 , giving s@xmath5 = 1.1 . after correcting for the presence of young stellar populations this",
    "value rises to s@xmath5 @xmath1 2 , so still a relatively low s@xmath5 elliptical .",
    "the gc luminosity function revealed a peak at the universal value ( ie m@xmath4 @xmath1 7.5 ) and the metallicity distribution was bimodal with peaks [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.5 and 0.5 .",
    "the ratio was 2.5:1 for metal - poor to metal - rich .",
    "any models of merging spirals should take into account not only the pre - existing metal - poor gcs but also the metal - rich ones ( which could be a significant fraction in the case of early - type spiral progenitors ) .",
    "@xmath0 metallicity distributions .",
    "all galaxies , irrespective of hubble type , appear to have a population of metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.5 ) gcs .",
    "galaxies with bulges have a metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.5 ) population also",
    ". some particular exceptions may exist ( eg woodworth & harris 2000 ) . .",
    "+ @xmath0 metallicity - mass relation .",
    "the mean metallicity of the metal - poor gcs is almost constant at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 1.5 , whereas the mean value for the metal - rich ones varies with host galaxy mass ( ie luminosity or velocity dispersion ) .",
    "this suggests that the metal - poor ones formed slightly pre - galactic while the metal - rich ones know about the potential that formed they in ( forbes & forte 2001 ) .",
    "+ @xmath0 size trend .",
    "metal - poor gcs are , on average , 20% larger than metal - rich ones irrespective of hubble type ( larsen et al . 2001 )",
    ". this effect may be due to conditions at formation or subsequent dynamical evolution due to different orbits .",
    "+ @xmath0 spatial distribution . in general , the metal - rich gcs in ellipticals are centrally concentrated and appear to follow the ` bulge / spheroid ' light . whereas the metal - poor gcs are more extended and",
    "are associated with the halo .",
    "@xmath0 metallicities .",
    "spectra have confirmed the bimodality seen in optical colours and the metallicity range of less than one hundredth solar to twice solar",
    ". + @xmath0 ages .",
    "relative ages , from lick indices , are now available for a number of gcs in ellipticals . these suggest that most gcs are old ( @xmath1 12 gyrs ) although there is tentative evidence that the red gcs may be a few gyrs younger than the blue ones .",
    "there are also cases now of some intermediate ( puzia et al .",
    "2002 ; larsen et al . 2002 ) and young age gcs in otherwise ` old ' ellipticals ( forbes et al .",
    "it is not yet clear how significant this younger subpopulation is compared to the total .",
    "one caveat is the possible presence of blue horizontal branches which may affect the age determinations based on the h@xmath6 line ( lee et al .",
    ". + @xmath0 abundances .",
    "to date most gcs in ellipticals are consistent with supersolar abundances , ie [ mg / fe ] @xmath1 + 0.3 ( although maraston et al .",
    "2001 found solar ratios for gcs in the ongoing merger ngc 7252 ) .",
    "this indicates the dominance of sn ii over sn ia in their formation , which is probably due to a short time scale for star formation .",
    "further abundance studies will reveal important chemical evolution clues .",
    "+ currently all high quality spectra ( ie h@xmath6 errors of @xmath7 ) of gcs beyond the local group come from the keck telescope .",
    "these include : + ngc  1399 forbes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) + m81 schroder et al .",
    "( 2002 ) + m104 larsen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) + ngc  524 beasley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) + ngc  4365 larsen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) + in the near future , spectra from the vlt and gemini telescopes will add to this list .",
    "an example of three gcs in ngc  1399 observed by keck + lris is shown in fig . 1 . here",
    "the exposure time was 3.5 hours and the typical h@xmath6 error was @xmath30.20.4 . for ngc  1399 we found ( forbes et al .",
    "2001 ) that the gcs covered the full metallicity range , ie 2.2 @xmath8 [ fe / h ] @xmath8 0.3 , and that most of the blue and red gcs were old ( @xmath1 12 gyrs ) .",
    "however we also found two young ( @xmath1 2 gyrs ) gcs .",
    "all of the gcs were consistent with having supersolar [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios .",
    "gc system kinematics have only been measured for a small number of elliptical galaxies ( eg kissler - patig & gebhardt 1988 ; zepf et al .",
    "2000 ) , and each system appears to have slightly different kinematic trends .",
    "so it is difficult to draw general conclusions .",
    "this situation should change rapidly with new spectrographs coming online which have hundreds of slits ( eg deimos , gmos , vimos ) .",
    "as well as constraining galaxy formation models , it will be interesting to compare mass estimates from gcs ( which require assumptions about orbits ) with those from x - ray measurements ( which requires the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ) .",
    "three scenarios had been proposed to understand the observations of extragalactic gc systems in the context of galaxy formation .",
    "they are late stage mergers ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) , two - phase collapse at early epochs ( forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) and accretion ( cote , marzke & west 1998 ) .",
    "galaxy formation itself is often interpreted using a semi - analytic code ( eg cole et al .",
    "2000 ) within a @xmath9cdm universe .",
    "recently we simulated the formation of gcs around ellipticals using the galform semi - analytic code ( eg cole et al .",
    "2000 ) in such a universe for the first time .",
    "this model involves elements of mergers , collapse and accretion .",
    "details of this work can be found in beasley et al .",
    "briefly , gcs are formed in two modes of star formation . in the first , or ` quiescent '",
    "mode , metal - poor gcs form in proto - galactic clouds .",
    "these gaseous clouds collapse / merge , giving rise to a burst of star formation . during this `",
    "burst ' mode , the vast bulk of the galaxy stars form along with the metal - rich gcs .",
    "the final gc system depends on the local galaxy environment and its mass ( luminosity ) .",
    "for example , low luminosity field ellipticals tend to have a more extended star formation history which is more bursty in nature .",
    "we would expect such galaxies to reveal metal - rich gcs that are 3 - 5 gyrs younger in the mean than the metal - poor ones which are @xmath112 gyrs old in all ellipticals .",
    "more high quality spectra with 8 - 10 m class telescopes should be able to test this prediction .",
    "we had to make two key assumptions in order to produce bimodal gc colour distributions .",
    "the first was to fix the efficiency of forming gcs vs field stars ( this was chosen to match observations of m49 ) .",
    "the second was to stop the formation of metal - poor gcs at redshift z = 5 .",
    "there was no physical basis for this , but such a redshift may be associated with the epoch of reionisation ( see cen 2001 ) .",
    "the model ellipticals have gc systems that can reproduce the diversity seen in hst studies ( eg larsen et al .",
    "2001 ) and the relation between number of gcs and galaxy luminosity ( ie typical s@xmath5 = 5 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot s@xmath5 ( number of gcs per unit galaxy starlight ) vs the ratio of blue ( metal - poor ) to red ( metal - rich ) gcs .",
    "we compare the model predictions of 450 ellipticals with galaxies for which wide field imaging data is available .",
    "we also show the range of parameters for the major merger model of bekki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . the galform model and",
    "the data both show a weak trend for the higher s@xmath5 galaxies to have relatively more blue gcs , ie it is the number of blue gcs that drives s@xmath5 .",
    "examination of the evolution of s@xmath5 with time in individual galaxies also indicates that most of the change in s@xmath5 occurs at early epochs and late stage mergers have only a minor effect on s@xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    on the other hand",
    ", major mergers would require a different trend . to form a high s@xmath5 system via mergers",
    "one needs many red gcs .",
    "the major merger predictions of bekki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are clearly at odds with the data , suggesting that such mergers are not the dominant process in creating high s@xmath5 galaxies",
    ". indeed observations of young ( few gyr old ) ellipticals suggest s@xmath5 values close to 23 ( after correction for the m / l ratio of the younger stellar populations ) .",
    "the observations of extragalactic gc systems indicate that : + @xmath0 the inner metal - rich gcs in the milky way and other spirals has a bulge ( not disk ) origin .",
    "+ @xmath0 the gc systems of spirals and ellipticals show remarkable similarities .",
    "+ @xmath0 blue and red gcs have similar ages @xmath1 12 gyrs ( but red gcs could be younger by 24 gyrs ) .",
    "+ @xmath0 some young ( @xmath1 2 - 8 gyrs ) gcs have been found in ` old ' ellipticals .",
    "+ @xmath0 blue and red gcs appear to have supersolar alpha ratios .",
    "+ @xmath0 red gcs trace elliptical galaxy star formation .",
    "+ the modelling of gc formation in a @xmath9cdm universe indicates that : + @xmath0 blue gcs formed @xmath1 12 gyrs ago in all ellipticals .",
    "+ @xmath0 red gcs have a mean age of 810 gyrs in field ellipticals .",
    "+ @xmath0 s@xmath5 is driven by the number of blue gcs in a galaxy and is largely determined at early epochs ; late stage mergers have little effect on s@xmath5 .",
    "+ @xmath0 in general , spirals and ellipticals have similar gc systems .",
