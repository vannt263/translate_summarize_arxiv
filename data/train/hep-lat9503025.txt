    "numerical simulations of an asymptotically free field theory on a lattice provide information about continuum physics when they are performed at values of the correlation length which lay within the scaling window .",
    "this region is defined by the inequalities @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the lattice spacing , the correlation length and the lattice size respectively .    to this window",
    "it corresponds another scaling window in terms of the bare coupling @xmath8 . to understand the relationship between both regions , it is enough to recall that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is proportional to some power of @xmath8 . in this expression",
    ", @xmath11 is the renormalization group independent mass parameter .",
    "this parameter depends on the regularization used , thus the scaling window in terms of the bare coupling can be shifted towards the region of lower couplings if we use a lattice regularization in which @xmath11 is small .",
    "gauge theories regularized on a random lattice present a @xmath11 parameter some orders of magnitude smaller than on a regular square lattice  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the simulations on a random lattice can be performed at lower values of the bare coupling .",
    "this fact may make the simulations on random lattices more advantageous than on regular square lattices . the physical signal in the monte carlo data can be masked by the presence of pertubative expansions related to mixings , perturbative tails and finite renormalizations of composite operators defined on the lattice .",
    "if the expansion parameter is smaller ( and the perturbative coefficients do not get larger ) , these perturbative terms may be better controlled and the non - perturbative physical signal be more clearly seen .",
    "also the non - universal terms in the scaling function could be less relevant , thus expediting the asymptotic scaling .",
    "the computation of the perturbative coefficients on random lattices might seem rather involved .",
    "however , the higher degree of rotational invariance on a random lattice should help in this respect  @xcite .    in order to address these prospects on a physically interesting theory , like qcd , in reference",
    "@xcite one of us started to study some features concerning another asymptotically free field theory , the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model in two dimensions .",
    "the action for this model in the continuum is @xmath12 with the constraint @xmath13 for all @xmath14 . in reference",
    "@xcite we chose this theory because of its properties in common with qcd .",
    "indeed , it is an asymptotically free field theory  @xcite and presents a topological content  @xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , its mass gap is exactly known  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the first coefficients of the renormalization group functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 for this model regularized on a random lattice are universal and that the @xmath11 parameter depends on the degree of randomness @xmath18 ( see below ) used in the construction of the random lattice .",
    "the present work has several aims .",
    "firstly , we want to verify the @xmath18 dependence of the @xmath11 parameter and support the scenario of a common continuum limit , the same than that of the theory defined in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) . for this purpose",
    ", the theory with @xmath15 , 4 and 8 has been simulated on both regular and random lattices to extract the topological susceptibility and mass gap .",
    "we have also succesfully used the cooling method  @xcite on a random lattice to extract the topological content of the theory .",
    "the @xmath15 value was chosen to study both the topological susceptibility and the mass gap , while the higher values of @xmath19 were used in order to have a better asymptotic scaling  @xcite on the mass gap data .",
    "another reason to study the topological charge on random lattices is that some sites on these lattices can group together forming clusters with a typical size less than one lattice spacing .",
    "this geometry might allow the existence of very small instantons which could hardly survive on regular lattices .",
    "we have always used lattices large compared to the correlation length at our @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , 300 and 400 .",
    "we have never averaged the results of the simulations among different random lattices because the previous lattice sizes are large enough to include an implicit average among several subregions of the lattice .",
    "the updating has been performed by using a cluster algorithm  @xcite adapted to the random lattice .",
    "another purpose of the present work is to analyse whether the simulations on a random lattice improve the asymptotic scaling or not .",
    "actually , this is easy to check with the mass gap data because the value of @xmath22 is known  @xcite . as it was shown in  @xcite , @xmath23 for the @xmath1-model .",
    "hence , it is not expected any dramatic shift of the scaling window towards small values of the bare coupling .    to construct the random lattice",
    ", we followed the procedure of t. d. lee at al .",
    "the only new ingredient is the introduction of a degree of randomness @xmath18 .",
    "the sites of the lattice are the centers of hard spheres , the radius of which is @xmath24 .",
    "these hard spheres are randomly located . at small values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the lattice is locally less random as we will see in section 2 .",
    "there is a @xmath25 at which all distributions ( link lengths , distance between neighbouring sites , plaquette areas , etc . )",
    "become dirac deltas .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we explain how to construct a random lattice and discuss in detail both the @xmath18 dependence and some geometrical properties like average link lengths and average distance between neighbouring sites .",
    "we also give a geometrical argument in favour of a unique random lattice , once @xmath18 is fixed , as the number of sites gets larger . in section 3",
    "we explain the simulation algorithm used . in section 4",
    "we recall the scaling and @xmath20 functions for the non - linear @xmath1 model .",
    "we also explain the procedure followed to extract both the mass gap and the topological susceptibility . a detailed description of the cooling method is also given . in section 5",
    "we show and analyse the monte carlo data for the physical observables described in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we define a random lattice as a set of @xmath26 points located at random on a volume @xmath27 with the condition that there are no two sites closer than @xmath28 where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing and @xmath18 is a parameter to be fixed . these sites are placed with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , we consider the 2-dimensional lattice as a torus . in order to simulate a field theory on this geometry",
    ", we must define a net of connections throughout the lattice , linking neighbouring sites . in the first part of the section",
    ", we will explain how to place the sites on the lattice and in the second part we will review the triangularization process which is used to construct the links and plaquettes .",
    "finally , we will give some properties of the random lattices .",
    "if @xmath26 sites are placed on a 2-dimensional volume @xmath27 , we define the lattice spacing @xmath5 as @xmath29 .",
    "the sites of our random lattice are the centers of hard spheres ( actually discs ) , the radii of which are @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the sites are not closer than @xmath28 . fixing the parameter @xmath30 $ ] yields random lattices of different degrees of randomness as we will see .",
    "the value of @xmath25 can be determined with the following argument . for large values of @xmath18 , the discs are small and they can be placed loosely on the volume @xmath27 .",
    "then , the distributions of link lengths , distances between sites , etc .",
    "display a wide dispersion of values .",
    "instead , for small @xmath18 there is less play in placing the discs and consequently the distributions show a smaller variance . on a regular square lattice",
    ", the hard discs will be placed as in figure @xmath31 . in this case ,",
    "but also when @xmath32 there can be a bit of dispersion in the distributions characterizing the geometry of the lattice . for example , if we shift one column as shown in figure @xmath33 then the distance @xmath34 from any site @xmath35 to its closest neighbour still satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "the link lengths are no longer all equal to @xmath5 . in particular , the links joining the shifted sites with their non - shifted neighbours are strictly longer than @xmath5 .",
    "thus , a lattice constructed with @xmath37 need not be regular .",
    "the usual regular square lattice is only a particular case of the lattice with @xmath32 .    from these considerations",
    ", one can conclude that the smallest @xmath18 is reached when the hard discs are packed tight as in figure 2 , forming an hexagonal lattice . in this case , the hard nature of the discs prevent the sites from shifting or moving from their positions in the figure .",
    "therefore , all link lengths , distances between sites , etc .",
    "are the same . stated in other words ,",
    "the corresponding distributions are dirac deltas . as a consequence",
    ", the corresponding @xmath18 must be the smallest allowed .",
    "the volume occupied by a regular hexagonal lattice with @xmath38 sites is @xmath39 , hence the parameter @xmath18 is @xmath40 .",
    "an explicit recipe for putting the @xmath26 sites on the volume of the lattice is the following .",
    "the first site must be put at random in any position on the volume @xmath27 .",
    "now , imagine we have already placed @xmath41 sites , then , by using the random generator , we propose the coordinates of the @xmath42-th site and check that its distance to all the @xmath43 previously accepted sites is less than @xmath28 .",
    "if the check is satisfied , we accept this site . if not , we reject it and repeat the process by proposing another @xmath42-th site .",
    "this procedure is repeated until all @xmath26 sites have been placed on the lattice .",
    "clearly , the number of proposed sites @xmath44 satisfies @xmath45 . in figure 3",
    "we plot the experimental ratio @xmath46 as a function of @xmath18 obtained during the construction of lattices with @xmath47 and @xmath48 sites . from this plot ,",
    "it is clear that the construction of random lattices with small @xmath18 is quite time consuming .",
    "one can speed up the check about distances by dividing the volume @xmath27 into boxes , large enough to contain a few sites on average .",
    "then , the check for a proposed site is performed in the box it belongs to and in its neighbouring boxes . however , even with this improvement , creating lattices with @xmath49 is almost impossible with our recipe .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath18 we have used in our simulations is @xmath50 .",
    "the ratio @xmath46 depends only on @xmath18 , not on @xmath26 .",
    "figure 3 confirms this statement .",
    "let us derive a theoretical expression for the curve in figure 3 for large @xmath18 .",
    "if a site can not have neighbours closer than a distance @xmath28 , then once @xmath43 sites have already been placed , the area left free for putting new sites is @xmath51 .",
    "this expression does not take into account the fact that these circles of radius @xmath28 can overlap ( with the constraint of leaving their centers , the sites , not covered ) . for large @xmath18 ,",
    "the overlaps are less frequent and the previous formula is adequate .",
    "therefore , the probability for a proposed point to be accepted after having put @xmath43 sites is @xmath52 now , using @xmath53 , we conclude that the total number of proposed sites divided by @xmath26 is @xmath54 for large enough @xmath26 , the sum becomes an integral giving the ratio @xmath46 as a function of @xmath18 @xmath55 this expression , as previously stated , is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "it works well for @xmath56 .",
    "once the lattice volume @xmath27 has been filled with the @xmath26 sites for some chosen value of @xmath18 , we proceed to the triangularization process .",
    "we follow the method of reference  @xcite .",
    "it consists in joining sets of three sites to form a triangle with the only condition that the circle circumscribed by these three points does not contain any other site .",
    "the sides of that triangle are the links joining the three sites and the triangle itself is a plaquette .",
    "this construction is unique and fills the whole lattice with no overlapping among the triangles  @xcite .",
    "we also impose periodic boundary conditions in the triangularization process . in figure 4",
    "we show two @xmath57 sites random lattices , with @xmath58 and @xmath59    it is useful to define also the dual lattice .",
    "its dual sites are the centers of the above - mentioned circumscribed circles .",
    "it is clear that any link is the common side of two triangles .",
    "thus , every link of the random lattice must be surrounded by two dual sites .",
    "the line joining these two dual sites is called the dual link .",
    "therefore , every link is associated with a dual link .",
    "let us call @xmath60 the @xmath61-component of the link vector that points from the site @xmath35 to the site @xmath62 .",
    "the length of this link is @xmath63 .",
    "the length of the corresponding dual link is @xmath64 . throughout this work",
    ", we will often make use of the matrix @xmath65 defined as @xmath66 we introduce another vector , @xmath67 which is twice the vector joining the center of the vector link @xmath68 with the center of the associated dual link @xmath69 .",
    "another useful quantity is @xmath70 defined as @xmath71 \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf z}}.\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath72 is the unit vector orthonormal to the plane of the lattice , oriented as @xmath73 .",
    "the set of dual links around the site @xmath35 , @xmath74 , determine a convex region called voronoi cell . the area of this cell is @xmath75 .",
    "as soon as the lattice has been constructed , one can devise tests to check the triangularization .",
    "the first and easiest one is to verify that the number of triangles ( links ) is equal to twice ( three times ) the number of sites  @xcite .",
    "other good tests are the integral properties  @xcite @xmath76 a third test consists in demanding that the quadratic part of the action has only one zero mode  @xcite .",
    "the action for the 2-dimensional @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model on a random lattice can be written as  @xcite @xmath77 in this equation , @xmath8 is the coupling constant .",
    "@xmath78 denote sites and @xmath79 stands for the value of the field @xmath80 at the site @xmath35 .",
    "this is the action we will make use in our numerical simulations , both on regular and random lattices . for a regular square lattice , @xmath65 is 1 for linked sites and zero otherwise .",
    "hence , eq .  ( 2.7 ) becomes the standard action when it is considered on a regular lattice .",
    "one can show that the _ nave _ continuum limit of eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) is the correct action for the model in the continuum , eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) .",
    "we see from figure 4 that random lattices with large ( small ) values of @xmath18 display a higher ( lower ) degree of randomness .",
    "as it was shown in reference  @xcite , random lattices with different @xmath18 are different regularizations of the same theory .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the @xmath11 parameter is @xmath18-dependent . in the present paper",
    ", we will check this statement by a numerical simulation and , moreover , we will give hints that the non - universal non - leading coefficients of the @xmath20 function of the model are also @xmath18-dependent .",
    "the level of randomness can be clearly manifested with the distributions of some geometrical properties of the lattice .",
    "the first property we plot is the distance of one site to its nearest site , @xmath81 .",
    "this distance , referred to the site @xmath35 , was written before as @xmath34 . in figure 5 , we show the probability distribution of this distance , @xmath82 for a @xmath58 lattice .",
    "the histogram in the figure is the numerical result , obtained by calculating @xmath34 for a single site on 30000 random lattices of 1000 sites .",
    "the solid line is the theoretical well known poisson distribution , @xmath83 both curves are normalized to 1 and should coincide .    in figure 6",
    ", we show the same distribution for a @xmath84 random lattice .",
    "it was obtained as in figure 5 , with 30000 random lattices of 1000 sites .",
    "notice that the distribution displays less dispersion .",
    "the cutoff of the curve is placed at @xmath28 .",
    "given a random lattice constructed with some finite value of @xmath18 , all sites are farther from each other than @xmath28 . if we bring together two of these sites a distance less than @xmath28 , the random lattice will not vary its geometrical properties .",
    "we checked that the results of the simulations performed on it , do not vary either .",
    "indeed , apart from a tiny bump at some position between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , figure 6 will not change .",
    "the more sites the random lattice has , the tinier the bump becomes .",
    "another quantity we can plot is the distribution of link lengths . in figure 7",
    "we show the distribution of link lengths @xmath87 for a random lattice with @xmath58 .",
    "given a site on the lattice , it is always linked with the closest site to it .",
    "but it can also be linked with sites placed quite far away .",
    "this is why figures 5 and 7 differ .",
    "finally , in figure 8 we show the distribution of link lengths for a random lattice with @xmath50 .",
    "again we see that the distribution is sharper as @xmath18 becomes smaller .    in table 1",
    "we show the numerical average values of link lengths @xmath88 and distance between closest sites @xmath89 for several values of @xmath18 .",
    "these quantities can be used to characterize the degree of randomness . however",
    ", our method to construct the random lattice needs only the knowledge of @xmath18 as previously explained .",
    "therefore , we will label our random lattices with this @xmath18 parameter .",
    "the column for @xmath88 was obtained averaging the link lengths of random lattices with 10000 sites for @xmath90 and 1000 sites for @xmath91 . the column for @xmath89",
    "was calculated by averaging @xmath81 on a single site for 30000 random lattices of 1000 sites for @xmath58 and @xmath92 ; for @xmath93 we averaged on 14 random lattices of 100 sites .",
    "the numbers shown depend on the lattice size . as this size gets larger ,",
    "the averages tend to stabilize .",
    "for instance , the averages for @xmath94 calculated on random lattices of 100 , 1000 and 10000 sites with @xmath58 are 0.523(2 ) , 0.508(2 ) and 0.504(2 ) respectively . the exact value computed from eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) is @xmath95 .",
    "the errors shown are only statistical and do not include this systematic effect .",
    "the value of @xmath88 for @xmath58 is known theoretically  @xcite , it is @xmath96 in good agreement with the value shown in table 1 . the trend shown in figures 5 , 6 and 7 , 8 is consistent with the fact that as @xmath97 the distributions become a dirac delta .",
    "these dirac deltas are equal and centered at @xmath98 .",
    "as the number of sites gets larger , all random lattices with a fixed value of @xmath18 become equivalent . to support this statement",
    "we have generated 100 lattices for several values of @xmath7 and verified that the average link length presents less standard deviation among the 100 lattices as @xmath7 becomes greater . if we define @xmath99 , where @xmath88 is the average link length among the 100 lattices for a fixed value of @xmath7 and @xmath100 is the standard deviation of this average , the results are @xmath101 for @xmath102 respectively .",
    "this analysis was done with @xmath58 random lattices .",
    "the best algorithm for the updating of the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model in a numerical simulation is the non - local wolff algorithm  @xcite . on the regular lattice",
    "it does not show any critical slowing down .",
    "let @xmath103 be the time correlation of the markov chain of states generated by the algorithm .",
    "let @xmath6 be the spatial correlation length of the model ( a well defined function of @xmath20 ) .",
    "then , the wolff algorithm has the fundamental property that @xmath103 does not increase as the critical point , corresponding to @xmath104 , is approached .",
    "this nice property is allowed by the intrinsic non locality of the wolff updating and has nothing to do with the details of the lattice .",
    "we argue that it should hold also for the straightforward generalization of the wolff algorithm on the random lattice . indeed",
    ", our numerical data show that the algorithm performs very well at increasing @xmath20 , just like in the regular case .",
    "the above mentioned generalization is obtained as follows : we start by choosing at random one lattice site @xmath35 and an unitary vector @xmath105 .",
    "there is a great freedom in the distribution of @xmath106 . to be definite we chose the uniform distribution on the hypersphere by taking at random a point inside the hypercube @xmath107^n$ ] and rejecting it if @xmath108",
    "then , @xmath109 .",
    "we now mark with a label the site @xmath35 and all of its neighbours according to the probability weights @xmath110.\\ ] ] we continue recursively from the new marked sites and proceed further until no new site is added to the list of labelled sites .",
    "when the recursive process ends , we collect in a cluster all the marked sites and transform them with a reflection @xmath111    as wolff has shown  @xcite , in the process of construction of the cluster , all the quantities entering the r.h.s .  of @xmath112",
    "have already been calculated at each updating step .",
    "the above expression is called an improved estimator for the two point function . in eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) @xmath26 is the total number of sites of the lattice , @xmath113 is the number of sites in the cluster and @xmath114 is the characteristic function of the cluster .",
    "another advantage of this estimator is that it can be measured after each updating step without need of decorrelating updatings .",
    "the physical observables that we have measured are the mass gap for several values of @xmath19 and the topological charge for @xmath15 . for each of these quantities",
    "we have studied the asymptotic scaling behaviour .",
    "the universal 2-loop @xmath20 function of the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model is @xmath115 and therefore the lattice spacing obeys the renormalization group law @xmath116 the first non - universal correction for this scaling function on a regular lattice is known  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath117 is known both for regular  @xcite and random lattices  @xcite .    any dimensionful quantity @xmath118 measured on the lattice with the operator @xmath119 must satisfy ( after the subtraction of the relevant mixings ) @xmath120 when @xmath121 .",
    "asymptotic scaling holds when the l.h.s .  of",
    "the above expression , with the first terms of the beta function in @xmath122 , depends little on @xmath20 .",
    "the analytical prediction for the mass gap of the @xmath1 model is  @xcite @xmath123 which combined with the ratio  @xcite @xmath124 gives @xmath125 .    in order to evaluate @xmath126",
    "we studied the wall - wall correlation function by integrating the two - point function along the spatial direction and studying it at large temporal separations .",
    "notice that on the random lattice the @xmath43-th temporal slice must be defined as the set of sites with @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , the number of sites that this time slice contains is a function of @xmath43 .",
    "this is a source of systematic error . as @xmath26 , the total number of sites , gets larger",
    ", the width of the time slice @xmath128 can be smaller and reduce the previous systematic error .",
    "numerical studies on the regular lattice indicate that a fit of the wall - wall correlation monte carlo data to the behaviour @xmath129\\ ] ] is enough to reproduce the data  @xcite .",
    "to avoid correlation among data at different @xmath130 , we used sets of different runs for every @xmath130 . hence , the statistical errors obtained are reliable .",
    "the above mentioned improved estimator , eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) , reduces greatly the statistical noise which affects this measure particularly at large @xmath130 .",
    "we have also measured the topological charge and susceptibility of the @xmath131 model on a random lattice .",
    "the topology of this model is based on the stereographic map from the sphere @xmath132 onto the projective plane  @xcite .",
    "the topological charge actually counts the winding or instanton number of this mapping on classical configurations . in the continuum",
    "it is defined as @xmath133 and it rigorously yields integer values on a smooth field configuration . at the quantum level , @xmath134 is a composite operator which requires a renormalization procedure .    on a random lattice , we introduce the following definition of topological charge at the site @xmath35 @xmath135 which , by using eqs .",
    "( 2.5 ) and ( 2.6 ) , reproduces the continuum expression , eq .",
    "( 4.7 ) . on a regular lattice , where @xmath136 , @xmath137 is equal either to @xmath138 or to @xmath139 and @xmath65 is 1 for linked sites and 0 otherwise , eq .  ( 4.8 ) reproduces the standard definition  @xcite . the total topological charge @xmath134 is calculated just by @xmath140 .",
    "an interesting and non - trivial quantity which can be extracted from the topological charge is the topological susceptibility which in the continuum is defined as the two point correlation of the topological charge at zero external momentum @xmath141 on the lattice , this is rewritten in the following way @xmath142    the monte carlo data for the topological susceptibility @xmath143 is  @xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 , eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) , @xmath146 is the non - perturbative vacuum expectation value of the density of action and @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the renormalizations which can be calculated perturbatively  @xcite . on",
    "the regular lattice @xmath146 is negligible  @xcite and so is the second term in the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "we have not calculated all of these renormalizations on the random lattice but instead we have used the cooling method  @xcite .",
    "the cooling procedure is a relaxation process which after a few cooling steps ( @xmath150 3040 steps ) have almost eliminated all short scale fluctuations leaving the long waves still present . if we assume that these short scale fluctuations , of order @xmath151 , are responsible for the quantum noise which shows up as renormalization effects , then after some cooling steps all renormalizations in eq .",
    "( 4.11 ) will disappear and the physical and monte carlo topological susceptibility will be related by the expression @xmath152 however the situation for the @xmath131 @xmath1 model is not so simple . in this model , instantons tend to be small .",
    "indeed the distribution of instantons with radius @xmath153 in this theory satisfies @xmath154 . as a consequence ,",
    "the previous cooling process can also eliminate small @xmath151 instantons , thus modifying the topological content of the configuration .",
    "this unwanted behaviour of the cooling occurs on regular lattices  @xcite . on a random lattice",
    "some sites can group together forming clusters with a typical size less than one lattice spacing .",
    "this fact happens mostly on large @xmath18 lattices ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "this geometry might allow the existence of very small instantons with a size @xmath155 .",
    "this is the main motivation for studying the topological properties of the model on random lattices .    in figure 9",
    "we show the evolution of the topological charge for 40 uncorrelated configurations as the cooling process goes on . at zero cooling step the value of the charge on the lattice",
    "is on average @xmath156 .",
    "instead , after 30 or 40 steps , this charge reached an almost integer value which depends only on the underlying instantonic content of the original configuration .",
    "this almost integer value remains stable for a long plateau .",
    "thus , we assumed the value of @xmath157 after 30 or 40 steps of cooling as the correct topological charge of the configuration .",
    "we checked that the value of the topological susceptibility is also stable on the plateau .",
    "indeed , the value obtained is within errors , the same if 30 , 40 or 50 cooling steps are performed .",
    "it can also be seen from figure 9 that the value of @xmath157 after several coolings is not exactly an integer .",
    "this is a general fact and has to do with the fact that instantons are not exact solutions of the theory defined on a lattice .",
    "we also checked that the susceptibility is insensitive to rounding this number to its nearest integer .",
    "we chose for our analysis the values of @xmath157 after 30 cooling steps without rounding it to the nearest integer .",
    "we now turn to a detailed description of the cooling step .",
    "it consists in locally minimizing the action with respect to the field at each site once per step .",
    "we used a controlled cooling  @xcite .",
    "this means that for a given positive number @xmath158 , the new field @xmath159 and the old one @xmath160 differ less than @xmath158 , @xmath161 .",
    "first we define the force relative to the site @xmath35 as @xmath162 and then we compute the distance between the force and the field at this site @xmath35 , @xmath163 .",
    "now , if @xmath164 then the new field is going to be @xmath165 . instead , if @xmath166 then the field at the site @xmath35 becomes @xmath167 where @xmath168 is chosen to be @xmath169 in a step of cooling we pass through all sites @xmath35 of the lattice and perform the previous modification on the corresponding field @xmath160 .",
    "in this section we will show the set of monte carlo data obtained for the mass gap and the topological susceptibility and discuss their consequences .    in table 2",
    "we show the set of data for the mass gap and the @xmath131 @xmath1 model on lattices of @xmath170 sites . they are also shown in figure 10 .",
    "the data were obtained from 12000 measures of the improved correlator , eq .",

    "we fit these data to the scaling function of eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the parameters of the fit .",
    "in particular , @xmath173 must be equal to @xmath174 in order for the data to scale as the @xmath20 function of the theory predicts , eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) , and @xmath172 must be @xmath175 .",
    "the fit gives @xmath176 for the regular lattice , @xmath84 and @xmath58 random lattices respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the result of  @xcite concerning the universality of the random lattice : the first coefficient of the beta function is the same in any lattice regularization .",
    "now , imposing @xmath177 and leaving @xmath172 free we obtained @xmath178 for regular lattice , @xmath84 and @xmath58 random lattice respectively , with a value for @xmath179 equal to 6/11 , 8/11 and 9/12 respectively . following  @xcite and  @xcite , the expected results for @xmath172 are 80.09 , 87.05 and 44.49 respectively .",
    "we excluded any finite size explanation to this discrepancy .",
    "we arrived at this conclusion because @xmath180 the technique of reference  @xcite did not improve the results and @xmath181 the fits with the data of table 3 for @xmath182 lattices yielded similar results for @xmath172 .",
    "we think that the disagreement is due to the fact that our range of @xmath20 is narrow enough to collect into @xmath172 all the power - law corrections to the asymptotic scaling function .",
    "unfortunately , another single free parameter is not able to account for the whole non - universal terms correcting eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) and it did not improve dramatically the result for @xmath172 .    from the results of the fits for @xmath172 we can get the ratio between @xmath11 parameters .",
    "let us define @xmath183 at a given @xmath18 .",
    "then , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "these results are in agreement with the average of the ratios obtained from each @xmath20 : @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "these ratios for each @xmath20 are shown in figure 11 .",
    "the theoretical values  @xcite are @xmath188 and @xmath189 . for @xmath84 theoretical and monte carlo ratios",
    "are in agreement within errors .",
    "but this is no so for @xmath58 .",
    "we again think that this is due to the lack of asymptotic scaling .",
    "it is well known that asymptotic scaling is rather elusive in the @xmath131 @xmath1 model and here we have realised that this problem does not ameliorate if a random lattice is used .",
    "for this reason , we also performed runs for the @xmath190 and @xmath191 models where it is known that asymptotic scaling is better achieved  @xcite . in table 4 the mass gap data for @xmath190 on lattices with @xmath182 sites are shown . in table 5 the same data are shown for @xmath191 and lattices with @xmath192 sites . in both cases 12000 measures of the improved estimator , eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) , were performed for each @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath190 data of table 4 were fitted to @xmath193 the result for @xmath173 was again close to 1 : 1.02(4 ) , 1.05(7 ) and 1.04(4 ) for regular , @xmath84 and @xmath58 random lattices respectively .",
    "fixing @xmath173 to 1 , we obtained for @xmath172 26.6(5 ) , 28.4(9 ) and 22.3(4 ) for for regular , @xmath84 and @xmath58 random lattices respectively , while the predicted values are  @xcite 24.02 , 25.55 and 16.01@xmath194 .",
    "we see a much better agreement between theoretical and monte carlo results .",
    "the ratio of @xmath11 parameters extracted from the monte carlo data is @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the theoretical ratios are  @xcite 0.94(2 ) and 1.5(1 ) respectively .",
    "the agreement for @xmath58 is still not satisfactory .",
    "the data of table 5 for @xmath191 were fitted to @xmath197 again @xmath173 was satisfactorily close to 1 .",
    "the fit for @xmath172 shows a good asymptotic scaling ( @xmath198 for the regular lattice while eqs .",
    "( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) give 9.48 ) .",
    "so we expect that this time the ratios of @xmath11 parameters extracted from monte carlo will be in agreement with the theoretical ones .",
    "the monte carlo ratios are @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the theoretical ratios are 0.95(2 ) and 1.3(1 ) respectively .",
    "we conclude that the dependence of the @xmath11 parameter on @xmath18 , the degree of randomness of the lattice , is qualitatively correct .",
    "the figures shown in  @xcite for these ratios are also correct but the lack of asymptotic scaling prevent us from checking them for the @xmath0 model when @xmath201 68 .",
    "let us now discuss the results for the topological susceptibility obtained for the @xmath131 model .",
    "in table 6 we show @xmath143 after 30 cooling steps which , as described in section 4 , equals @xmath202 .",
    "these data have been obtained on lattices with @xmath170 sites performing the cooling process on 1000 uncorrelated configurations for each @xmath20 . in figure 12",
    "we show this set of data for the three kinds of lattices used and the result of the fits performed on it by imposing the scaling function eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) with @xmath177 .",
    "it is apparent that the data do not scale as eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) imposes .",
    "if @xmath173 is left free , we see again that the data do not scale as they should . indeed ,",
    "for the regular lattice , @xmath84 and @xmath58 random lattices , we obtain @xmath203 respectively .",
    "we repeated the same analysis on larger lattices to check whether this discrepancy is due to finite size effects on the data . in table 7",
    "we show the data for a regular lattice with @xmath192 sites and in table  8 the data for a @xmath58 random lattice with @xmath182 sites .",
    "they are also obtained by cooling 1000 uncorrelated configurations .",
    "the fit on the data of table 7 gives @xmath204 and the fit on table  8 @xmath205 . from these figures",
    "we could hardly conclude that the lack of correct scaling is due to finite size effects .",
    "we think that this problem must be traced back to the elimination of small instantons during the cooling process . probably , the use of large @xmath18 random lattices is not enough to avoid this effect .",
    "the lack of asymptotic scaling prevented us from using the topological susceptibility and the mass gap data to check the physical scaling of the @xmath131 model on random lattices .    in figure 13",
    "we show the ratio of @xmath11 parameters for each value of @xmath20 from the data of the topological susceptibility . the average result for this ratio is surprisingly similar to the one obtained from the mass gap data : @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "we have used the random lattice to simulate the 2-dimensional @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model .",
    "the sites of the random lattice are considered as the centers of hard spheres of radius @xmath24 where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing .",
    "these hard spheres are located at random on the lattice volume .",
    "the links between neighbouring sites are established by a well known triangularization process  @xcite .    to compare the performance of different lattices",
    ", we made the simulations on regular lattices and random lattices with both @xmath84 and @xmath58 .",
    "we used the wolff algorithm  @xcite for the simulations as well as an improved estimator  @xcite for the computation of two - point correlation functions .",
    "we measured the mass gap ( as the inverse of the correlation length measured from the wall - wall two - point correlation function ) and the topological susceptibility .",
    "the topological charge was calculated by using a cooling technique  @xcite and we introduced a regularized operator for the topological charge on the lattice ( see eq .",
    "( 4.8 ) ) .    the monte carlo results for the mass gap scale as they should , confirming previous claims  @xcite about the universality of the random lattice regularization .",
    "they do not present any finite size problems ( for @xmath170 sites ) but for small values of @xmath19 the asymptotic scaling is not fulfilled . for the @xmath191 model ,",
    "where the data display a good asymptotic scaling , we can reproduce the theoretical value for the ratio between lambda parameters @xmath3 for @xmath58 , thus confirming the semi - analytical prediction of reference  @xcite . instead , for @xmath84 , the monte carlo value for the previous ratio is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction already in the @xmath131 model .",
    "this could mean that both regularizations ( regular lattice and @xmath84 random lattice ) are quite similar and in particular the non - universal terms in the scaling function , eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) , almost coincide .",
    "this assumption is also supported by the fact that @xmath3 for @xmath84 is close to 1 . in any case , these conclusions are consistent with the scenario where also the non - universal terms in the scaling function , eq .  ( 4.2 ) are @xmath18-dependent .    the data for the topological susceptibility scale very badly .",
    "we think that the cooling process removes small instantons thus modifying the topological content of the configuration also on random lattices .",
    "the cooling smooths out fluctuations with a length of order @xmath151 . for smaller @xmath20",
    "the lattice spacing is longer in physical units , therefore the number of eliminated instantons when smoothing out @xmath151 fluctuations is also larger .",
    "this explains why the data in figure 12 and tables 6,7 and 8 are shifted downwards for small @xmath20 .    in any case",
    ", our results prove that the semi - analytical method used in reference  @xcite is reliable to perform analytical calculations on random lattices .",
