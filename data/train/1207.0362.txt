    "in the past few years there has been an increase in the number of networked machines on current networks designed for human - centric communications .",
    "this has led to a shift in the conventional perception on communications towards device - centric communications , which is independent of human interaction  @xcite .",
    "while the requirements of traditional human - centric communications are high bit - rates and lower latency , in device - centric communications , the main requirement is the massive transmission of simultaneous low data rate messages .",
    "the main challenge in machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications , denoted as machine - type communications ( mtc ) by 3gpp , is to adapt cellular networks to efficiently handle mtc traffic characteristics , specifically the load generated by massive simultaneous low data rate transmissions . within 3gpp , there is an ongoing study on the adaptation of the 3gpp cellular networks to handle the mtc traffic  @xcite , through the inclusion of enhanced load control mechanisms in the radio access network ( ran ) .",
    "this is paramount , because due to the expected large number of deployed mtc devices , the cellular networks are expected to withstand traffic bursts  @xcite . in such situations , radio and signalling network congestions may occur due to mass concurrent transmissions  @xcite , which can lead to large delays , packet loss and , in the extreme case , service unavailability .    in 3gpp there",
    "have been proposed several solutions for managing the random access load  @xcite .",
    "these solutions include access class barring  @xcite , and back - off schemes , where the network controls the load by restricting and delaying the random access , thus spreading the random access in time and reducing the effect of batch arrivals .",
    "other solutions divide and adapt the amount of random access resources for human - centric and device - centric traffic , such as orthogonal random access  @xcite and dynamic random access  @xcite , where overload due device - centric traffic will not affect the human - centric traffic and vice versa .    in this paper",
    "we propose a random access method inspired by the lte random access , which is in line with the dynamic random access channel ( rach ) resource allocation approach . here",
    "the dynamic resource allocation is not accomplished through traditional means , such as the increase of the number of available preambles and/or random access sub - frames , but instead by introducing the concept of code - expanded random access .",
    "the motivation behind this proposal is to enable existing systems to sustain a large and bursty random access loads , while preserving the physical layer unchanged and incurring minimal changes in the medium access control layer .    to illustrate what is meant by code - expanded random access , consider the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : codewordexample ] , where the selection of preambles and sub - frames in the reference and in the proposed code - expanded random access schemes are depicted . in the reference scheme ,",
    "each mtc user ( m - ue ) performs the random access by selecting one of the available preambles , in this example denoted as _ a _ and _ b _ , and then selecting a random access sub - frame to transmit the chosen preamble , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : codewordexample](a ) .",
    "the base station ( bs ) then discerns between m - ues according to the observed preambles in each random access sub - frame , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : codewordexample](c ) . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : codewordexample](b ) , the random access sub - frames are grouped in _ virtual frames _ and the random access is performed on the virtual frame level . in each sub - frame of the virtual frame , the m - ue transmits one or none of the available preambles ( we assume that in the case when none of the preambles is transmitted , the m - ue actually transmits an _ idle _ preamble , henceforth denoted as _",
    "i _ ) , thus creating an _ access codeword _ with length equal to the length of the virtual frame . in this case",
    ", the bs observes the distribution of preambles over the virtual frame sub - frames , i.e. , observes a set of access codewords that are then used to discern between m - ues .",
    "the proposed code - expanded random access scheme is a generalization of the reference scheme . in the reference scheme the codewords",
    "are composed of just one preamble sent in one of the sub - frames of the virtual frame , with the remaining sub - frames at idle . in the proposed scheme , each m",
    "- ue selects a codeword consisting of a randomly chosen preamble ( including the idle preamble ) per every sub - frame of the virtual frame . in this way",
    ", the number of contention resources is expanded and the amount of collisions is reduced - a collision occurs when two or more m - ues select the same codeword , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : codewordexample](c ) .    on the other hand",
    ", while reducing the amount of collisions , the code - expanded generalization introduces a shortcoming not present in the reference scheme . in the reference scheme",
    ", the codewords do not introduce ambiguities at the bs in regards to which codewords where transmitted , i.e. , based on the observation of the preambles in the virtual frame , the bs can always discern which codewords were actually sent . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "such ambiguities exist - based on the observation , the bs may conclude that there are more codewords present in the virtual frame than there were actually sent .",
    "namely , multiple combinations of transmitted codewords can yield the same observation , introducing phantom codewords which were not sent by any of the transmitting m - ues . in fig .",
    "[ fig : codewordexample](d ) is depicted a combination of the three codewords used by m - ues , which misleads the bs to perceive the phantom codeword @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of phantom codewords affects adversely the performance , however , we show that this is significant only when the network is experiencing low user loads . specifically , we show that the efficiency of the proposed approach ( i.e. , the fraction of m - ues that successfully contended for access ) for moderate and high loads and for the same number of used preambles and sub - frames in the virtual frame , is substantially higher than the efficiency of the reference scheme , despite the drawbacks caused by phantom codewords .",
    "we also show that by choosing the operating random access method according to the user load , it is possible to maintain an efficient random access over a large load region using the same number of preambles and sub - frames .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : systemmodel ] we model and analyse both the reference and the proposed random access scheme . in section",
    "[ sec : adaptivecodeexpandedrandomaccess ] we discuss how the proposed code - expanded scheme can be used to enable a random access mechanism which adapts according to the load in the random access .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in lte the random access is performed through the random access channel ( rach ) , which is mapped in the physical layer to the physical random access channel ( prach )  @xcite . to start the asynchronous access each m -",
    "ue first selects one of the designated preambles and then waits until the next available prach sub - frame .",
    "the m - ue then performs the random access procedure , as described in  @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of the prach resources can scale according to the expected rach load .",
    "therefore , the prach resources can occur from once in every sub - frame to once in every two frames , where a frame consists of 10 sequential sub - frames  @xcite . as outlined in section  [ sec : introduction ] , we assume that a group of consecutive sub - frames is organized in a virtual frame reserved for prach ( i.e. , random access ) , as depicted in the fig .

    "we denote the number of sub - frames within a virtual frame by @xmath1 and the number of available preambles by @xmath2 .",
    "the reference scheme considered here is inspired by the lte random access  @xcite .",
    "we model it as an access reservation scheme  @xcite , as depicted in figure  [ fig : accessreservation ] .",
    "we focus on the contention phase , which consists of @xmath1 sub - frames ( contention slots ) , and these sub - frames constitute a single virtual frame .",

    "the outcome of the contention phase is the set of the codewords perceived by the bs , and all the perceived codewords are assumed to belong to the m - ues that successfully contended for the access .",
    "however , the set of perceived codewords actually contains the codewords that are used just by a single m - ue ( singles ) , codewords that are used by multiple m - ues ( collisions ) and codewords that are used by none of the m - ues ( phantom codewords , see fig .",

    "@xmath17 we use a representation based on a markov chain ( mc ) that describes the evolution of the perceived number of codewords by the bs when the number of contending m - ues increases sequentially from 1 to @xmath3 .",
    "we note that it is assumed that the m - ues select their codewords independently and uniformly at random from the set of available codewords .",
    "the mc states are determined by the configuration that corresponds to the number of the observed preambles in the sub - frames of the virtual frame , which is created by the actual codewords selected by the m - ues .",
