    "recently @xcite a formalism was presented that allows the calculation of the equivalent photon spectra corresponding to nuclear transitions of relativistic nuclei ( @xmath1 ) . in this way it became possible to study corrections such as the influence of nuclear excitations on two - photon processes .",
    "the example that was studied was one nucleus making a transition to the giant dipole resonance state ( gdr ) , while at the same time emitting an equivalent photon .",
    "it is the purpose of this brief report to study simultaneous projectile and target excitation using the equivalent photon method . using this method",
    ", we will see that the results derived previously by benesh and friar @xcite can be simplified very much and the physics behind this process is made more transparent .    throughout this report",
    "we assume that we can always use the long wavelength approximation .",
    "this requires that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the space part of the photon momentum and @xmath4 the radius of the nucleus . from this",
    "we conclude , that the excitation energy @xmath5 and therefore also the energy of the photon @xmath6 has to be low , that is , @xmath7 .    in the equivalent photon approximation ( epa )",
    "the cross section for the simultaneous excitation is expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the equivalent photon number of the inelastic photon emission process , and @xmath10 is the cross section for the photoabsorption process for a photon of energy @xmath6 in the rest frame of the nucleus .    in @xcite the equivalent photon number for the inelastic photon emission",
    "was derived neglecting the longitudinal components of the electromagnetic field . in the limit of high ion energy ( @xmath11 )",
    "the result is @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the four - momentum transfer and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given generally by @xmath16 \\\\ d & = & \\frac{(-q^2)^2}{(\\delta^2-q^2)^2 m^2 } 2 \\pi \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\left[2 |m^c|^2 + \\frac{\\delta^2-q^2}{-q^2}\\left ( |t^e|^2 + |t^m|^2 \\right )   \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the usual coulomb , electric , and magnetic matrix elements and @xmath20 is determined by the kinematics of this process as @xmath21 for high values of @xmath22 we can safely neglect the term proportional to @xmath14 compared to @xmath15 in eq .",

    "\\label{eq : tm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly the cross section for the photoabsorption can be written as follows in the narrow resonance limit , @xmath28 for the photoabsorption of on - shell photons we have of course to set also @xmath29 for the process in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : te ] ) and  ( [ eq : tm ] ) .",
    "let us examine the simultaneous excitation of the gdr of two nuclei @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagram is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mutual ] .",
    "we can view this process in two different ways , depending on which we consider the emitter and absorber of the equivalent photon .",
    "let us assume that nucleus @xmath31 is at rest and is excited to the gdr by absorption of a photon with energy @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the excitation energy of the gdr .",
    "this equivalent photon is emitted by the fast moving nucleus @xmath30 , which is excited to its gdr due to this emission .",
    "the excitation to the @xmath0 gdr is an @xmath34 transition , proportional to @xmath35 . using this in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epa ] ) , we get the cross section as @xmath36 we see that the result is symmetric with respect to both ions .    when integrating over the transverse momenta , we have to keep in mind that the finite size of the nucleus limits the range of @xmath37 .",
    "the integrand therefore has to be multiplied by the square of the form factor @xmath38 of both ions . using a gaussian form factor for both ions @xmath39 as a model for the inelastic form factor",
    ", we can evaluate the equivalent photon number analytically as @xmath40 , \\label{eq : gauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the usual exponential integral @xcite , @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 , and @xmath44 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qmin ] ) .",
    "an even simpler expression can be found by cutting off the integration over @xmath37 at @xmath45 , where @xmath4 is approximately the sum of the radii of the ions .",
    "integrating and keeping only the leading term for large values of @xmath22 gives the equivalent photon number @xmath46 and the cross section @xmath47 we can see that the dependence of the cross section on @xmath48 and @xmath33 drops out .",
    "it is essentially only proportional to the product of the corresponding @xmath35-values .",
    "the limit of large @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) has the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) with @xmath49 given by @xmath50 .",
    "but please note that this result is only valid for a gaussian form factor . as discussed in @xcite ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "10 there ) @xmath51 is much more sensitive to the detailed form of the form factor at large @xmath52 than in the elastic case due to the higher order of @xmath53 in the numerator of the integral .",
    "the cross section is also independent of @xmath22 unlike the elastic case where the cross section increases with @xmath54 for large gamma .",
    "it can be shown easily that eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) is valid if @xmath55 . as already shown earlier ,",
    "it is also symmetric with respect to ions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so the role of both can be interchanged .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) has a similar form as found in @xcite , but in contrast to that work our result depends on @xmath4 and therefore on the size of the nuclei .    in the goldhaber - teller model @xcite or the sum - rule model @xcite the @xmath35",
    "is given by @xmath56 and therefore depends on the excitation energies .",
    "this dependence on @xmath48 and @xmath33 remains of course in the final formula .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmpsigma ] we compare the results of the different equations . for the exact calculation we have used the goldhaber - teller model for matrix element and have used a gaussian form factor , with",
    "@xmath42 chosen to reproduce the usual @xmath57 of the nucleus .",
    "no further approximation are made .",
    "this is compared with the results of the equivalent photon approximation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) and  ( [ eq : approx ] ) .",
    "we see that for not too high energies we get good agreement between all three .",
    "also shown are the results as given by eq .  ( 11 ) of @xcite .",
    "they agree reasonable with our results .",
    "please note that our results depend on the detailed form of the form factor at large @xmath52 , the good agreement between our three results therefore depends also on the use of the same form factor in all of them .",
    "of course the mutual excitation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutual ] , is not the only process leading to two excited nuclei in the final state .",
    "there are also other ones , like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higher ] , whose contribution can become more important for higher @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "let us look also at other multipolarities .",
    "magnetic @xmath60 transitions can be treated in a similar way . as an example",
    "we look at the case of a @xmath61 excitation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole ] . as initial and final states have the same quantum numbers , this case can also be used to study the limit of elastic interaction , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "we expect to get then the equivalent photon spectrum due to the static magnetic moment of the nucleus . the equivalent photon spectrum for the static magnetic moment was already studied in @xcite .",
    "here we are looking at the excitation of a @xmath61 transition in the other nucleus as well .",
    "the ion that emits the photon , has an equivalent photon number @xmath63 where we have used the simple cutoff form factor and kept only the leading term in the limit of @xmath64 .",
    "the cross section for the simultaneous excitation is then given by @xmath65 which again is proportional to the product of the two @xmath66 values and identical in form to eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx ] ) . the known result for a static magnetic moment",
    "is obtained by replacing the @xmath66 value in the limit of @xmath62 by the magnetic moment @xmath67",
    "according to @xmath68    on the other hand if we exchange the roles of both ions , we have the situation where the equivalent photon spectrum of the @xmath69 transition in the fast moving nucleus @xmath31 ( with @xmath60 excitation energy @xmath33 ) is absorbed by the static magnetic moment of nucleus @xmath30 ( with @xmath70 ) .",
    "although the integral over the equivalent photon spectrum taken by itself diverges for @xmath71 , the product with the corresponding photoabsorption cross section ( which vanishes for @xmath71 ) leads to a constant limit .",
    "it seems interesting to study this limiting case for other possible transitions too , for example , for the transition @xmath72 .",
    "this is a special case as the photon emission is dominated by the @xmath73 matrix element with @xmath74 and no corresponding @xmath75 exists . therefore the photoexcitation cross section vanishes for @xmath74 and we do not expect to be able to exchange to role of both ions .    in principle",
    "the equivalent photon approach can also be extended to other , higher multipolarities , for example , quadrupole excitations .",
    "we may also study transitions with different multipolarities for the two ions .",
    "we have only looked briefly at these processes , because the cross sections will be quite small . for the @xmath76 transition",
    ", we expect the cross section to be proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "these processes therefore become less and less important , as the higher order processes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : higher ] , dominate the observed cross sections , see also @xcite .",
    "we now discuss some of the limitations of this approach , one has to be aware of .",
    "one has to keep in mind that , in contrast to the elastic case , the inelastic equivalent photon approach is more and more dominated by the large values of @xmath53 when going to higher multipolarities . therefore the results are much more sensitive to the detailed form of the form factors of both ions than in the elastic case .",
    "the equivalent photon spectrum is therefore no longer a property of the emitting nucleus alone , but of the absorbing nucleus as well .",
    "this should become more and more important as the multipolarity is increased .    in the case of the photon - photon collisions ,",
    "as studied in @xcite , these limitations are less important , because we have two distinct transverse momentum scales : one scale is the limit of the @xmath52 of the emitted photon .",
    "this is given by the inverse of the nuclear radius @xmath78 .",
    "the other one is the range of @xmath52 , where the virtual photon can be replaced a real photon .",
    "this scale is normally given by the invariant mass of the produced system , which is much larger than the nuclear scale .",
    "the only exceptions are the @xmath79-@xmath80-production and to a smaller extent the @xmath81-@xmath82-production .",
