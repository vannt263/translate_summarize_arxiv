    "reciprocity is one of the basic symmetries in wave physics , in which the source and the detector can be exchanged without changing the transmission coefficient @xcite .",
    "breaking this symmetry ( non - reciprocity ) is particularly useful in amplification .",
    "indeed , the signal source often needs to be protected from noise coming down the amplification chain in reverse .",
    "hence , low noise measurement chains incorporate non - reciprocal devices such as circulators and isolators .",
    "these devices exploit a particular non - reciprocal effect known as faraday rotation , which relies on ferrites and permanent magnets , in order to distinguish between polarized waves propagating in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "circulators and isolators also play a pivotal role in state of the art quantum readout of superconducting qubits that utilize josephson parametric amplifiers . incorporating these devices as preamplifiers preceding the standard high electron mobility transistor amplifier ( hemt )",
    "has significantly improved signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "it has allowed performing single - shot quantum nondemolition readout of the qubit state , monitoring its quantum trajectories in real time and studying back - action effects on the qubit state due to weak and strong measurements @xcite . however , present josephson parametric amplifiers operating at the quantum limit , such as the josephson bifurcation amplifier ( jba ) @xcite , the josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa ) @xcite and the josephson parametric converter ( jpc ) @xcite , suffer from a serious limitation .",
    "they amplify in reflection even when the device has two ports .",
    "thus , in order to separate between incoming and outgoing signals traveling on the same transmission line , and to protect the qubit from the amplified reflected signal , it is imperative to add a chain of at least two circulators between the qubit and the preamplifier . in the case of the jba for example , which lacks a spatial and temporal separation between the pump and the signal ,",
    "these circulators are further needed in order to reject the reflected strong pump .",
    "unfortunately , using such a readout scheme comes at the cost of introducing losses between the cavity - qubit system and the preamplifier , hence adding noise to the processed signal .",
    "it also prevents an on - chip integration of the cavity - qubit system with the preamplifier .    for these reasons",
    ", there is a growing need for a directional josephson amplifier which ( 1 ) has two ports and works in transmission , ( 2 ) is matched to the input , ( 3 ) treats the input and output fields differently ( non - reciprocal ) , and ( 4 ) builds on the present performances of josephson parametric amplifiers , i.e. power gain , dynamical bandwidth , added noise and maximum input power @xcite .",
    "while the transmission requirement might have a possible engineering solution , for instance , by measuring the idler port in the case of the jpc ( which is at a different frequency ) , or using the two - port version of the jpa @xcite , matching to the input or achieving non - reciprocity is a pressing challenge .",
    "[ htb ]    [ t ! ]    one example of a superconducting non - reciprocal element is the microstrip squid amplifier ( msa ) @xcite .",
    "the msa is biased with a dc - current and converts an ac flux signal at the input into an amplified voltage at the output .",
    "it suffers from several drawbacks : ( 1 ) it dissipates energy on chip , ( 2 ) it has out - of - band back - action which can affect the system under test , and ( 3 ) it is suitable for amplifying low frequency signals of hundreds of megahertz ; engineering a matching circuit so that it amplifies with large enough gain and low enough noise above @xmath5 @xmath6 is difficult .",
    "another example of a directional element is the traveling wave parametric amplifier @xcite .",
    "the new amplifier exploits the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting transmission lines in order to parametrically amplify weak propagating microwave signals .",
    "the main disadvantages of this amplification scheme are : ( 1 ) it dissipates energy on chip due to the finite resistance of the superconducting films , ( 2 ) it does not operate near the quantum limit ; the added noise by the amplifier back to the input is about @xmath7 photons at @xmath8 @xmath9 , ( 3 ) it requires an elaborate microwave engineering in order to inhibit generation of higher harmonics of the pump , limit the amount of dispersion exhibited by the nonlinearity of the device , and suppress gain ripples / reflections which arise from imperfect impedance matching , and ( 4 ) it lacks temporal and spatial separation between the signal and the pump tones .",
    "a new traveling wave propagating parametric amplifier based on josephson junctions has also been reported very recently @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we have implemented and measured a novel josephson parametric amplifier based on three - wave mixing , which satisfies the four requirements of directional amplification outlined above .",
    "the basic building block of the new device is the josephson parametric converter ( jpc ) , which is a nondegenerate , dissipationless three - wave mixing amplifier @xcite .",
    "the jpc consists of two half - wave microstrip resonators denoted as signal ( s ) and idler ( i ) .",
    "the two resonators characterized by a resonance frequency @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and an external quality factor @xmath12 and @xmath13 , intersect at a josephson ring modulator ( jrm ) , which is positioned at an rf - current anti - node of the resonators .",
    "the jrm consists of four nominally identical josephson junctions and flux biased with half a flux quantum .",
    "when operated in the amplification mode , the device is fed by an intense coherent non - resonant tone denoted as pump ( p ) at frequency @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are the excitation frequencies of the signal and idler ( which lie within the bandwidths of the signal and idler resonators ) .",
    "the jrm , which functions as a nonlinear medium , mixes the three waves s , i and p and results in amplification of the signal and idler due to stimulated downconversion of pump photons into signal and idler photons . by expressing the outgoing wave amplitudes @xmath16 , @xmath17 of the signal and idler , given in units of square root of photon number per unit frequency , as a function of the incoming wave amplitudes @xmath18 , @xmath19 one gets in the frequency domain @xcite @xmath20     & = ra^{\\mathrm{in}}\\left [ + \\omega_{1}\\right ]   -i\\sqrt{r^{2}-1}e^{-i\\varphi}b^{\\mathrm{in}}\\left [ -\\omega_{2}\\right ] , \\label{aout}\\\\ b^{\\mathrm{out}}\\left [   -\\omega_{2}\\right ]     & = rb^{\\mathrm{in}}\\left [ -\\omega_{2}\\right ]   + i\\sqrt{r^{2}-1}e^{i\\varphi}a^{\\mathrm{in}}\\left [ + \\omega_{1}\\right ] , \\label{bout}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the amplitude reflection parameter , @xmath22 is the power gain of the device at the working point , @xmath23 is the phase of the pump , and @xmath24@xmath15 .",
    "the first and second terms on the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ aout ] ) , ( [ bout ] ) correspond to a cis - gain and trans - gain processes respectively .",
    "while the cis - gain process relates between output and input fields at the same port and frequency , the trans - gain process relates fields separated by frequency @xmath25 across different ports .",
    "note that the phase acquired in the trans - gain process is non - reciprocal and depends on the phase of the pump .    the new device shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] consists of two nominally identical jpcs paired together back - to - back on the same chip .",
    "the jpc@xmath26 on the left and jpc@xmath27 on the right , are coupled via a gap capacitor @xmath28 f@xmath29 between the two idler resonators , whose resonance frequency is @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the other end of the idler resonators is capacitively coupled to a superconducting island which is wire - bounded to ground .",
    "thus , the idler eigenmode is inaccessible through external ports and functions as an internal mode of the combined system .",
    "the device has two ports ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ( c ) ) , the feedlines of the s resonators of jpc@xmath26 and jpc@xmath27 . at the flux bias working point ,",
    "the s resonators of jpc@xmath26 and jpc@xmath27 resonate at @xmath32 @xmath31 , @xmath33 @xmath31 with a bandwidth of @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath35 respectively , which correspond to a total quality factor of @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "similar to the excitation scheme of a single jpc , the s resonators are addressed through the difference ( @xmath39 ) port of a @xmath40 degree hybrid .",
    "the two jpcs are driven by two independent non - resonant pump tones .",
    "the pumps share the same frequency @xmath25 , but can have different phases @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the main idea of the device is based on utilizing the non - reciprocal phase response of the jpc in the amplification mode in conjunction with wave interference between multiple paths .",
    "these paths are formed , in the device , as a result of the couplings that exist between the idler @xmath43 and signal @xmath44 resonators of the two jpcs .",
    "the latter coupling is mediated by a ground plane mode , that is enhanced by the idler conductor between the two resonators .",
    "such direct coupling has been experimentally observed by injecting a weak signal though port @xmath45 and measuring the transmission through port @xmath46 ( and vice versa ) without applying any pump tones .",
    "it has also been verified using microwave simulations of the device configuration . as a result of the two couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 , feedback loops of the amplified signals",
    "are formed between the two jpc stages .",
    "of special importance in this scheme , is the trans - gain process in which signal photons are upconverted to idler and downconverted to signal with gain ( @xmath47 ) . due to the non - reciprocal phase response of the jpc , a signal that undergoes sequential trans - gain processes acquires a non - reciprocal phase shift which depends on the relative phase difference between the pumps . in one direction",
    ", it would acquire a phase shift of @xmath48 , whereas in the other direction , it would acquire an opposite phase @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast , amplified signals which follow a path of direct coupling acquire , regardless of direction , a constant phase shift which depends solely on the coupling parameters .",
    "in fig . [ meascalc ] ( a ) and ( e ) we plot power gain measurements for the four scattering parameters of the device , i.e. @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , as a function of the relative phase difference between the applied pumps at @xmath54 @xmath9 .",
    "the gain plots , obtained for different flux biases , are measured at @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath56 respectively . in the latter case of panel ( e ) ,",
    "the resonance frequencies of the two jpcs are @xmath58 @xmath9 and @xmath59 @xmath9 . in both measurements ,",
    "the two pump generators are phase - locked to the @xmath60 @xmath61 reference oscillator of a rubidium atomic clock .",
    "the phase difference between the pumps is varied in a continuous manner as a function of time , by introducing a frequency offset of a few hertz between the two generators . as can be seen in panel ( a ) ( panel ( e ) ) , for a certain relative pump phase difference , indicated by a vertical dashed line ,",
    "the device amplifies input signals in transmission @xmath51 with a maximum power gain of @xmath1 db ( @xmath62 db ) and attenuates reflections @xmath50 by @xmath63 db ( @xmath64 db ) . on the other hand ,",
    "incoming signals in the opposite direction are attenuated in transmission @xmath52 by @xmath46 db ( @xmath65 db ) and amplified in reflection @xmath53 by @xmath66 db ( @xmath67 db ) .",
    "note that the amplification in reflection ( @xmath53 ) , despite being generally undesirable , does not influence port 1 ( which would potentially be connected to a quantum system ) .",
    "the main differences between the two measurements are , ( 1 ) the data in panel ( e ) displays , at the desired working point , a significantly stronger directional response than panel ( a ) , i.e. about @xmath68 db difference between @xmath51 and @xmath52 in panel ( e ) versus @xmath69 db in panel ( a ) , and ( 2 ) the reflection curves @xmath50 and @xmath53 in panel ( e ) exhibit an asymmetrical response with respect to the relative pump phase compared to the curves in panel ( a ) .",
    "we attribute the observed asymmetry to nonlinear processes that arise at relatively high pump drives ( about 3 db higher on both pumps ) , which are applied in the case of panel ( e ) compared to panel ( a ) .",
    "in panels ( c ) , ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ meascalc ] , we plot a theoretical calculation based on a generic model of the device schematically drawn in fig .",

    "[ model ] ( b ) , using eqs .",
    "( [ aout])-([scomb ] ) ,    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79",

    "similarly , by solving the same equations for a unity input signal @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we obtain the scattering parameters @xmath53 and @xmath52 for outputs @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "[ htb ]    despite the simplicity of the theoretical model which we use to describe the complex dynamics of the system , the calculated curves show a good qualitative agreement with most of the scattering parameters data shown in fig .",
    "[ meascalc ] ( a ) and ( b ) . the main features which are successfully captured by the theoretical model are , ( 1 ) the non - reciprocity of the amplitude and phase response of the transmitted signals , @xmath51 versus @xmath52 , ( 2 ) the order of magnitude of the scattering parameter amplitudes , ( 3 ) the symmetrical response of the scattering parameters with respect to the pump phase difference , and ( 4 ) the fact that the reflection parameters @xmath50 and @xmath53 can be different . on the other hand ,",
    "the model falls short in yielding exact quantitative agreement with the data shown in panel ( a ) , and in reproducing the asymmetric curve shapes of the scattering parameters , especially @xmath50 and @xmath53 , shown in panel ( e ) ( even for different values of the model parameters ) .",
    "while the former shortcoming can be partly explained by the large parameter space of the theoretical model , which we tried to constrain as much as possible , we attribute the latter shortcoming to nonlinear effects , which come into play at elevated pump powers and are not accounted for in this model .",
    "in addition to explaining the data , it is worthwhile pointing out that solving the theoretical model gives some insight to certain requirements for directional amplification . in particular , we find that ( 1 ) a finite amount of  loss \" between the two jpc stages is required in order to obtain gain and directionality .",
    "a possible candidate for loss in our system is power leakage to other modes .",
    "for example , leakage to higher order modes of the system , or to the even mode , due to finite imbalance between the even and odd modes .",
    "( 2 ) some imbalance between the reflection parameters of the two stages @xmath88 and @xmath89 is needed in order to have different @xmath50 and @xmath53 responses .",
    "this finding agrees with the experiment since the observed gains in reflection on the two stages , when pump tones are applied separately , are generally unequal ( about 9 db on one stage and 2 db on the other ) .",
    "( 3 ) only certain coupling strengths and acquired phases between the two jpcs , give rise to directional amplification .",
    "this result is in agreement with the experiment as well , since we are only able to measure directional amplification for certain applied fluxes in the jrms and pump frequencies .",
    "the former control `` knob '' , the magnetic flux , sets the offset between the resonance frequencies of the two stages , while the latter , the pump frequency , determines the range of frequencies @xmath90 and @xmath91 which get excited within the bandwidths of the s and i resonators .",
    "having shown in fig . [ meascalc ] that the device satisfies requirements ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) of directional amplification , namely , the requirements of transmission , input - matching and non - reciprocity , we now set bounds on the device performances , i.e. dynamical bandwidth , added noise and maximum input power .",
    "[ htb ]    in fig .",
    "[ gainfreq ] , we plot the device scattering parameters measured as a function of signal frequency at the desired working point , indicated by a vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "[ meascalc ] ( a ) .",
    "we find that the dynamical bandwidth of the device @xmath2 @xmath92 taken at a power gain of @xmath93 db , is mainly limited by the bandwidth of the signal resonators .",
    "such dynamical bandwidth is , in general , suitable for qubit - state readout applications , as it exceeds the bandwidths of most readout cavities . nevertheless , for any practical qubit application",
    ", some tunability is required in order to easily match between the center frequency of the amplifier and the readout frequency .",
    "one possible way to achieve that , is by substituting the present jrm scheme ( shown in fig . 1 ( b ) ) by an inductively shunted version similar to the one introduced in ref .",
    "incorporating such rings in next generations of our device is expected to extend the tunable bandwidth to more than @xmath94 @xmath61 .",
    "another important figure of merit for quantum signal amplification is added noise . by measuring the improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio of the system due to the amplifier and using our knowledge of the noise temperature of the output chain ,",
    "we are able to set an upper bound on the noise added to the input by the amplifier . using this measurement method , we find that the device adds up to @xmath95 photons at the signal frequency which is similar to the bound we get for single jpc amplifiers .",
    "[ htb ]    furthermore , in fig .",
    "[ dr ] we display a maximum input power measurement taken for @xmath51 at the desired working point indicated in fig .",
    "[ meascalc ] ( a ) .",
    "the device gain , drawn in blue , is measured as a function of the input signal power .",
    "this measurement shows that the device at its maximum gain of @xmath93 db can tolerate at least three input photons at the signal frequency per inverse dynamical bandwidth .",
    "it also shows that the limiting mechanism on the maximum input power is pump depletion .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the gain curve to the magenta line , which depicts the bound on the input power of one stage jpc due to this effect @xcite .",
    "a possible improvement of this figure of merit is discussed in refs .",
    "we have implemented and measured a proof - of - principle , directional josephson amplifier suitable for qubit readout , which employs a novel non - reciprocal mechanism on chip and does not involve magnetic materials . to enhance the device performances , a deeper understanding of the role played by the microwave couplings between the two stages is required .",
    "an improved version of this amplifier with respect to microwave control and tunable bandwidth could allow in the future on - chip integration with qubit - cavity systems .",
