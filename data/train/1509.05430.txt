    "the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies in general requires their systematic observations over a large redshift domain .",
    "datasets for local ( today@xmath10s systems ) and distant galaxies ( their actual progenitors ) must be consistently gathered to avoid biases , a procedure that requires a knowledge of the very evolution we are seeking to understand . from an astrophysical perspective ,",
    "mechanisms regulating star formation , e.g. ram - pressure @xcite , harassment @xcite , starvation @xcite , depend on the distance from the center of the potential well of a cluster ; their effects on the stellar population of a galaxy depend on how efficiently the local environment is capable of removing the interstellar gas and affect the star formation history .",
    "thus , morphology , in a general sense , is just a snapshot reflecting all these processes imprinted in the galaxy image at a given time .",
    "traditionally , galaxy morphology has been addressed visually : an expert examines the images of galaxies and identifies features ( or absence of them , in the case of early - type galaxies ) which distinguish the object as belonging to a specific class , as done in @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , among many others .",
    "this classification paradigm is strongly subjective , prone to errors and can not be applied to the number of galaxies present in modern surveys for instance , @xcite compare their classification with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rc3 catalog ) ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "as it is clearly seen there is an uncertainty of approximately 1 in t - type within @xcite authors and about 2.5 between rc3 and @xcite .",
    "comparison between efigi and na2010 , for 1438 galaxies in common ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 32 ) , exhibits a similar sort of inconsistency , with an uncertainty between 2 and 3 in t - type .",
    "this tell us that , for example , visual classification does not agree when distinguishing an s0 from an sa or an e from an s0 .",
    "thus , it is imperative to quantify the morphology of a galaxy as a measurable quantity ",
    "morphometry  that can be coded in an algorithm .",
    "however , in spite of its uncertainties , visual classification is still important , because automated techniques would have difficulty doing classifications like @xmath11 which is much more valuable than just knowing whether a galaxy is s , s0 , or e. also , regarding rc3 , it should be noted that its classifications were made based on photographic plates or sky survey charts .",
    "modern digital images allow greater consistency between multiple classifiers and have the potential to greatly improve on rc3 .",
    "two approaches for galaxy morphometry have been widely explored recently : parametric  those which model the light distribution as a bulge plus disk plus other less important components representing a few percent of the total light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; non - parametric  those which use the measured properties of the light distribution , like concentration , asymmetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "each approach has its virtues and vices , as discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "one relatively successful non - parametric system is the concentration , asymmetry , smoothness , gini and m20 ( casgm ) system , presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this basic set has been enlarged with other quantities such as the srsic model parameters @xcite , and the petrosian radius @xcite , among others .",
    "these quantities may not work properly in the high redshift regime and this has been studied in recent papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these authors use multi - mode , intensity and deviation statistics , mid , to detect disturbances in the galaxy light distribution and show that it is very effective at z @xmath92 .    the previously mentioned way of establishing galaxy morphology answers two immediate needs .",
    "first , it is possible to reproduce human classification by positioning the galaxies in the space of these parameters . in such a supervised classification , a set of visually classified galaxies",
    "are used to train a discriminant function that will assign to each new galaxy a probability of belonging to each class . the second reason for establishing a galaxy morphometry system is that we can seek structures , in the quantitative morphology parameter space , that may yield clues for the physical reasons for their formation and evolution that are not visible in the currently human - based mode .",
    "further , a system such as the hubble tuning fork classification does not account for all the details that we can currently measure in galaxy images , and it does not hold as we go deep even at a moderate redshift @xmath12 . to evaluate this , a new quantitative classification procedure is needed , both to handle the large amount of data becoming available with the new surveys , and also to help us find the physical processes driving galaxy evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : related ] we discuss similar works ; in section [ sec : data ] we describe the datasets used ; in section [ sec : quantitative.morpho ] we define new nonparametric methods to quantify galaxy morphology ; in section [ sec : morfometryka ] we present the  algorithm .",
    "we apply the  code to galaxy samples described in section [ sec : classification ] , where we also test the robustness of the measured parameters and explore the ability of them to classify galaxy morphologies . in section [ sec : mi ] we propose a new morphometric index m@xmath8 . in section [ sec : results ] we compare m@xmath8 with other physical parameters and summary is presented in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "there have been several attempts to classify galaxies automatically , beginning with @xcite , among others . here",
    "we briefly mention recent works based on machine learning and on morphometric parameters .",
    "the list is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to present different approaches followed in the last few years .",
    "@xcite used a system based on colors , shapes and concentration to train a support vector machine to classify @xmath9700k galaxies from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic sample . for each galaxy",
    ", they estimate the probabilities of being e , s0 , sab or scd .",
    "it is not a pure morphometric classification , since it includes colors .",
    "@xcite analyses 56,000 cosmos galaxies with the zest algorithm , using five nonparametric diagnostics ( @xmath13 , @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and srsic index @xmath16 .",
    "they perform principal component analysis ( pca ) and classify galaxies with 3 principal components .",
    "they find contamination between galaxy classes in parameters space ( see their fig.10 ) , although they do not state clearly the success rate of the classification .",
    "@xcite present a detailed analysis of several critical issues when dealing with galaxy morphology and classification .",
    "several morphological features are intertwined and can not be estimated independently .",
    "they show the dependence between @xmath17 and @xmath16 , which is also presented here in a different form in appendix [ app : c_and_n ] . the authors claim that parameter based approaches are better for classification , and state that a system such as casgm has serious problems",
    ". however , they do not show it in practice .",
    "@xcite present a neural network machine to reproduce galaxy zoo classification .",
    "they work directly in pixel space , using a rotation invariant convolution that minimizes sensitiveness to changes in scale , rotation , translation and sampling of the image .",
    "the algorithm obtains an accuracy of 99% relative to the galaxy zoo human classification ; however , since the human classification is also error prone , as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , their algorithm reproduces also the errors in the human classification .",
    "@xcite introduced mid ( multimode , intensity and deviation ) statistics designed to detect disturbed morphologies , and then classify 1639 galaxies observed with hst wfpc3 with a random forest .",
    "it is one of the few works that state the detailed classifier performance , in terms of the confusion matrix coefficients .",
    ".number of objects in the databases used in this work .",

    "the virtue of @xmath23 is that both the numerator and denominator have the same dependence with the distance , hence @xmath23 is distance independent .",
    "the petrosian radius is used as a implicit scale length for each galaxy .",
    "the mean intensity within radius @xmath19 for a srsic model is the integrated luminosity up to @xmath19 divided by the region area @xmath24 , @xmath25 , so for @xmath26 , we have ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath27 we then have for the petrosian function eq .",
