    "fe  k fluorescence lines constitute a fundamental tool to probe the physical characteristics of the material in the close vicinity of x - ray sources @xcite . in the spectra of accreting x - ray binaries ( xrbs )",
    "these lines are very prominent due to of their intrinsic x - ray brightness and ubiquitous stellar material .",
    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) are composed of a compact object , either a neutron star ( ns ) or a stellar size black hole ( bh ) , accreting from the powerful wind of a massive ob type star . the compact object in these cases",
    "is deeply embedded into the stellar wind of the donor providing an excellent source of illumination .",
    "in contrast , in low mass ( lmxbs ) and intermediate mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) , the donor stars are not significant sources of stellar winds .",
    "however they usually feature strong and matter rich accretion disks around the orbiting compact object and also have associated outflow processes which , in turn , tend to be not so important in hmxb .",
    "fluorescence excitation occurs whenever there is a low ionization gas illuminated by x - rays . in xrbs ,",
    "the strong point like source of x - rays , allows to observe strong fluorescence emission .",
    "the x - ray source , powered via accretion , irradiates the circumstellar material , either the wind or the accretion disk . whenever this material is more neutral than li - like",
    ", the fe atoms present in the stellar wind absorb a significant fraction of continuum photons blueward of the k edge ( at @xmath7  ) thereby removing k shell electrons .",
    "the vacancy thus produced will be occupied by electrons from the upper levels producing k@xmath0 ( l @xmath8 k ) and k@xmath9 ( m @xmath8 k ) fluorescence emission lines at @xmath10 1.94   and 1.75   respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fecomplex ] ) .",
    "k - shell fluorescence emission is highly inefficient for electron numbers @xmath11 .",
    "the _ auger _",
    "effect dominates at lower @xmath12 although k shell emission can be observed under very specific circumstances  @xcite .",
    "however , the fluorescence yield increases monotonically with @xmath12 . in the case of fe ,",
    "fluorescence yields are already quite competitive ( 0.37 , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the fe is abundant and appears in an unconfused part of the spectrum .",
    "therefore fe  k fluorescence is observed in a wide range of objects .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0  line can present a composite structure . a broad line component , with _ fwhm _ of the order of kev and a narrow line component with _ fwhm _ much lower , of the order of some ev @xcite .",
    "however , as has been shown in @xcite , the detection of the broad component by _",
    "chandra _",
    "is very difficult and requires simultaneous _ rxte _ coverage .",
    "furthermore , nowak et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , observing cyg x-1 simultaneously with several x - ray telescopes ,",
    "have shown that while _ suzaku _ and _ rxte _ show clearly the broad component , _ chandra _  does not .",
    "on the other hand , _ suzaku _ agrees on the narrow component detected by _",
    "chandra_. in the present survey , we will focus specifically on the narrow component , which is best studied at high resolution .",
    "_ chandra _  high energy transmission gratings ( hetg , @xcite ) are very well suited for this purpose . while _ rgs _",
    "instrument on board _ xmm - newton _ has the required spectral resolution , it lacks of effective area shortward of 6  .",
    "the photons emitted during fluorescence must further travel through the stellar wind to reach the interstellar medium . in some cases , these photons can be compton downscattered to lower energies and a red shoulder can be resolved in the fe line ( @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case , the compton shoulder can be used as a further probe of the wind material .",
    "@xcite established a comprehensive catalog of fe line sources using _ exosat _ gspc .",
    "these authors were able to detect iron line emission in 51 sources out of which 32 were identified as x - ray binaries ( xrb ) . from these , 20 ( @xmath13 ) were lmxb and 12 ( @xmath14 ) hmxb .",
    "on average , the former showed a broad ( @xmath15 kev ) line centered at @xmath16 kev , while the latter tended to show narrower ( @xmath17 kev ) lines centered at @xmath18 kev .",
    "_ exosat _ gspc had a spectral resolution of about this amount and , therefore , a width of @xmath17 kev represents an upper limit .",
    "more recently , @xcite have performed a study of the fe k line in a sample of 20 lmxb using asca gis and sis data .",
    "these authors were able to detect significant fe line emission in roughly half of the sources .",
    "this line tended to be centered around 6.6 kev but showed large scatter with extreme values going from @xmath19 to 6.7 kev .",
    "in general , the fwhm is not resolved but for those sources where the width could be measured was @xmath17 kev .",
    "in this paper we study in a homogeneous way and at the highest spectral resolution , the narrow component of the fe line for the whole sample of hmxb and lmxb currently public within the _ chandra _  archive .",
    "specific studies of some individual sources within our sample have been published elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite for vela x-1 ) .",
    "however , we have reprocessed the entire sample to guarantee its homogeneity and have reanalyzed it , focused specifically on the narrow component .",
    "we have reprocessed all the available hetgs data for ob stellar systems which in the end involved 10 sources .",
    "we also searched for fe  fluorescence emission from 31 lmxb and found 4 cases of late type companions with positive detections .",
    "the sample is presented in table [ tab : sample ] . in the case of hmxbs",
    "we included observational information of all 10 sources available since we detected line fluorescence in all candidates . in the case of lmxbs",
    "we include such information only for those with clear detections , but list all the other targets in the footnote for reference purposes .",

    "some sources , like ls5039 , lmc x-1 and lmc x-3 , were excluded because there was no significant x - ray emission in the k@xmath0 region under study .",
    "there are many observations of cyg x-1 in the archive , but only two of these showed positive detections of the fek@xmath0  line . in this case",
    "we list only the obsids where we detected line fluorescence .",
    "likewise , sources presenting _ only _ warm absorption lines , like 4u1624@xmath649 have also been excluded .    for the present study we focus on the 1.6 - 2.5   ( @xmath25 kev - 7.74 kev ) spectral region , which contains both fe k@xmath0 , fe k@xmath9 emissions and the fe k edge ( fig.[fig : fecomplex ] ) .",
    "pile up has been found to be negligible in this spectral region except for very few sources not included in this survey .",
    "we treat the spectral continuum as local and use a simple powerlaw modified either by an edge at 1.740   or a photoelectric absorption ( ` phabs , tbabs ` ) . for the latter case we apply solar abundances from @xcite and cross sections from @xcite .",
    "our focus on the local continuum is justified by the fact that the process of inner k shell line fluorescence of neutral matter has a fundamentally different relation to its underlying continuum than in the photoionization of warm plasmas .",
    "while the latter requires photoionization energies much lower than the k edge energy to remove electrons down to he - like ions of fe , it requires photon energies beyond the fe k edge of 7.1 kev to remove an electron from the k shell of neutral fe . in this respect ,",
    "fe k shell fluorescence is entirely independent of the nature of the x - ray continuum below the fe k edge ( @xmath26  ) which allows us to focus on local continua only .",
    "furthermore , the recovery of the continuum beyond the k edge ( @xmath27  ) goes with the power of @xmath28 and is , thus , extremely steep , requiring to account for the bulk of absorption of photons only very close to the edge itself .",
    "this provides us with both the optical depth of the edge @xmath29 and the equivalent column density of the reprocessing material , @xmath5 .",
    "given the spectral range we have focused on , this latter quantity is measured from the k edge via the assumed abundance of fe with respect to h. apart from fe k@xmath0 and k@xmath9 emissions , other emission lines from photoionised plasma have been detected in many cases , most prominently at 1.85   ( @xmath30 kev , fe xxv ) , 1.78   ( @xmath31 kev , fe xxvi ly @xmath0 ) , and 1.66   ( @xmath32 kev , ni xxvii ly @xmath0 ) .",
    "whenever present , these lines were fitted with gaussians , to get a good fit in the whole wavelength range , but we do not study them here because they are out of the scope of the present paper . the edge has been fixed at 1.740   ( = 7.125 kev ) for all the sources .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting ] we present four representative examples of the quality of the fits .",
    "the upper row shows two hmxbs of our sample , vela x-1 ( left ) and cygnus x-3 ( right ) .",
    "as can be seen , the spectra of vela x-1 is relatively clean , showing only fe  k@xmath0 , fe  k@xmath9  and the k edge ( plus a small hot line beyond the edge ) .",
    "the spectra of cygnus x-3 , in turn , is more complex .",
    "it shows two hot lines , fe xxv and fe xxvi of photoionized iron .",
    "these latter lines , in particular fe xxv , can not be resolved in low resolution and broad band spectra and are often confused with the true fluorescence fe  k@xmath0  of ( near)neutral iron . hence the paramount importance of using _",
    "chandra _  for the present survey .",
    "the lower row corresponds to two lmxbs within our sample .",
    "the case of 4u1822@xmath637 ( left ) shows a morphology similar to that of the hmxbs .",
    "the high resolution now enables us to discern the hot line fe xxvi , at 1.78  , of photoionized iron not confusing it with fe  k@xmath9  at 1.75  . finally , we show the example of 4u1957@xmath2111 ( right ) which , as the vast majority of lmxbs , does not show any emission line or edge at all .",

    "the available data , therefore , are consistent with a spherical distribution of the fe fluorescence emission zone around the x - ray source .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that the continuum cross section of the wind in ob stars @xmath67 is always less than the interstellar value @xmath68 .",

    ", the scattering gas must be very cold , i.e. less than @xmath80 k. however , anytime the gas is cooler than @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the fe  k@xmath0  line energy , there will be net downscattering .",

    "[ fig : asym ] suggests that the fe  k@xmath0  line is formed in the shocked wind of hot stars illuminated by the x - ray source .",
    "our finding that narrow fe k lines are present in every hmxb but are very rare in lmxbs is in stark contrast with an early study by @xcite and a more recent study by @xcite . while in the latter study over about 50@xmath83 of line detections were clearly pointing towards the existence of ionized fe k lines , many detections allowed to be interpreted as fe line fluorescence .",
    "our analysis , on the other hand , shows that while @xmath84 of hmxbs show a presence of a narrow line , only less than @xmath85 of lmxbs do .",
    "likewise , we do not find much fe k edge absorption in lmxbs .",
    "this supports our previous findings and also the conclusion by @xcite that absorption in the interstellar medium dominates the neutral column density observed in lmxb spectra .",
    "studies of fe fluorescence in x - ray binaries are not trivial and issues regarding statistics , bandpass , and competing physical processes play a vital role in the interpretation of the results . in general , the process of fe line fluorescence is bandpass limited to the fe k line regions unless secondary competing effects exist .",
    "this has the advantage that we do not need to deal with broad band binary modelings , which are generally very difficult , uncertain , and even controversial .",

    "observation @xcite also shows such a broad line , but in contrast resolves the line into the fe xxv he - like triplet and the fe xxvi h - like line component ruling out fe line fluorescence . clearly , extreme cases of broad line emission as detected in some lmxbs ( bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2007 , cackett et al .",
    "2008 ) are difficult , if not impossible , to detect with local continua . however , besides the fact that they are still controversial , they also seem not to be associated with the fe k edge absorption as the line fluorescence in our survey .",
    "our study shows that the narrow fe  k lines detected are produced in the relatively cold wind of massive stars by reprocessing the x - ray photons from the x - ray source .",
    "the reprocessing material is spherically distributed around the x - ray source leading to narrow fek@xmath0  line widths of @xmath46  . for the measured fek@xmath0  wavelengths",

    "systems with strong winds will present a strong ( narrow ) fe  k line .",
    "it is not present in lmxb except in those rare cases where the system presents a substantial wind component . indeed , 4u1822@xmath6371 is the prototypical accretion disk corona source , cir x-1 presents a hot accretion disk wind @xcite , gx1@xmath214 is a symbiotic binary whose miii donnor has a powerful wind and her x-1 has an a type donor , the earliest of the late type companions .",
    "the wind however , can not be the only origin for narrow lines .",
    "indeed , illuminated disks can produce narrow lines , as well , under the right conditions .",
    "it has been observed , for example , in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 originating , at least partially , from a relativistic accretion disk @xcite .",
    "since we do not observe this line in lmxbs , either their disks are too hot or not illuminated .",
    "a particularly striking case is that of the hmxb cyg x-1 where only two , out of nine observations analyzed , have shown fe  k@xmath0  in emission .",
    "in these two cases the emission is amongst the weakest of the whole sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cygx1_asm ] we show all the _ chandra _  pointings overplotted on the _ rxte - asm _ lightcurve . as can be seen , the two observations where the line has been observed , marked by solid lines , do not correspond to the same spectral state of the source . during the obsid 2415 observation ,",
    "the source was in an intermediate state , with @xmath96 cps in the _ asm_. on the other hand , during the obsid 3815 observation , the source was clearly in a low ( hard ) state , with @xmath97 cps .",
    "the lack of detection in the highest states ( 2741 , 2742 , 2743 , 3407 , 3724 ) could be explained by the baldwin effect discussed in this paper : the increase of the luminosity of the x - ray source , increases the degree of ionization of the neutral fe , thereby decreasing the strength of the fluorescence line .",
    "this would be supported by the findings by @xcite and @xcite in which the neutral column densities decrease with increasing luminosity .",
    "the lack of detection during obsids 107 ( intermediate - low state ) and 1511 ( low state ) , can not be explained in this way and is enigmatic . as stated before , @xcite have shown that , for the case of gx339@xmath64 , the baldwin effect seems to be only effective in the high soft state and not in the low hard state .",
    "chandra hetg spectra thus proves to be uniquely qualified to separate narrow fe k line fluorescence from hot and broad line components . even though hetg spectra detect far less hot fe k lines in lmxbs than the survey conducted by asai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , this can easily be explained by the intrinsic variability of the the hot component in these sources as well as fitting biases in ccd spectra .",
    "we have reprocessed and analyzed the hetg spectra of all x - ray binaries publicly available at the _ chandra _  archive with specific focus on the fe  k line region .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from this analysis :    fe @xmath98 fluorescence emission seem to be ubiquitous in hmxbs .",

    "remains a significant fraction of near neutral fe , although much less than in other binaries of this survey .",
    "this remaining neutral fe , however , becomes ionized in brighter states with the disappearance of the fluorescence line .",
    "however , the lack of detection during other intermediate ( obsid 107 ) and low hard states ( obsid 1511 ) defies this explanation and means that this can not be the only mechanism at work in this system .",
    "in contrast , such emissions are found to be very rare amongst lmxbs .",
    "only four sources , out of 31 analyzed in this work , display the narrow component of fe @xmath98 in emission : 4u1822 - 37 , gx1 + 4 , her x-1 , and cir x-1 .",
    "this lack of narrow iron line is always accompanied by the lack of any detectable k edge .",
    "this finding , strongly suggests , that the neutral absorption column in lmxb is dominated by the interstellar medium while in hmxb the local absorption is very significant .",
    "this finding is in contrast with the previous work by @xcite , based on spectra of lower resolution , where the majority of sources showing fe line emission were lmxb .",
    "our findings , however , do not contradict the asca study of asai et al 2000 which claim the detection of hot lines in the majority of lmxb .",
    "we point out though , that these hot lines are not as frequently observed in _",

    "those few lmxb displaying fe @xmath98 in emission follow the same correlations found for the hmxb .",

    "this effect can be explained as hot compton shoulders.    fe line fluorescence is produced in the stellar wind of massive stars .",
    "systems with a substantial wind component will show this line . therefore it can be naturally observed in all hmxb . on the other hand , donor stars in lmxb",
    "are not significant sources of stellar winds and other sites must be invoked for the origin of this line .",
    "relativistic accretion disks , as observed in some seyfert galaxies , might be suitable candidates for those few lmxb with positive detections . however , the lack of the narrow fe line in the spectra of the vast majority of lmxb might be an indication that such accretion disks are too hot or not illuminated .",
