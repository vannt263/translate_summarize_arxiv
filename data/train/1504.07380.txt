    "a city is a complex organism , composed of many superimposing layers , such as transportation networks , the built environment , and different economic , social , and information flows @xcite .",
    "such layers are dynamical by nature , and give rise to generic patterns , such as fractal geometries @xcite .",
    "administrative boundaries overlook these aspects , and are not able to measure or record the dynamical aspects of cities in a consistent way across space .    between others ,",
    "street networks provide a good representation to characterise the morphology of a city , where a street network is defined as that planar graph where the street intersections @xmath4 are the vertices and the street segments @xmath5 are the links .",
    "we will consider here street intersections as being a good proxy for the urbanization process .",
    "such a choice reduces the complexity of the problem to that of a spatial point pattern .",
    "this has the value of simplicity .",
    "moreover , it has been positively tested before @xcite with some correlations between the number of street intersections and built area for urban systems are shown in the supporting information ( si ) , sec .",
    "[ t ]         considering a spatial window large enough to contain a given city and using an elementary clustering technique @xcite , we consider two street intersections to belong to the same cluster if they have a distance below a given distance threshold @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is measured in meters .",
    "increasing @xmath0 enlarges the size of the clusters , until eventually a giant component appears , which spans the entire street network .",
    "we measure the maximum cluster size @xmath7 in terms of number of intersections as a function of the increasing threshold @xmath0 , and we find that for all the cities @xmath7 grows exponentially and eventually the growth slows down and the curve condensates to a certain value ( see top panel fig.1 ) .",
    "this behaviour has been positively tested for all the largest cities in the uk and in california , suggesting that the maximum cluster size behaviour for cities highlights universal properties of urban morphology ( see si sec .",
    "ii for more details ) .",
    "the function defined by @xmath7 , i.e. , exponential growth followed by condensation , has the characteristics of the logistic growth function : @xmath8 where @xmath1 is the carrying capacity , @xmath9 is the growth rate and @xmath10 is the inflection point @xcite .",
    "following eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , we show that for cities in the uk and in california , @xmath7 grows as @xmath11 until the inflection point @xmath10 , and after that it condensates at a constant value given by the carrying capacity @xmath1 . in order to do that ,",
    "given the transformation @xmath12 , we expect that all the measured curves would collapse to a single curve , namely @xmath13 .",
    "we test this hypothesis for the 61 largest cities in the uk and for the 52 largest cities in california ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and si , sec .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and we can see that for both cases there is a very high correlation ( @xmath14 ) for the quality of the collapse . this correlation is maintained if the maximum cluster size is measured according to the number of street segments @xmath15 instead of the number of intersections . in this case",

    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    these results indicate that the proposed clustering technique is able to capture generic properties of urban street networks . in order to investigate this further , we look at how the logistic form of eq .  1",
    "is related to urban morphology and whether it allows us to define in a rigorous way the boundaries of a city .    as the logistic function is associated to the verhulst model @xcite ,",
    "it is interesting to understand how the carrying capacity @xmath1 , always referring to a reservoir in the system , could be associated to our clustering approach . to understand this",
    ", we notice that the largest cluster grows in the area where the intersection density is large , i.e. , the urban area ( see fig . 1 as a visual reference ) .",
    "the existence of a condensation phase shows that there exits an abrupt transition between the urban area and the rural area , where the intersection density consistently drops .",
    "hence , the reservoir could be interpreted as the set of intersections belonging to the urban network which are consumed while the maximum cluster grows , and then the carrying capacity represents the city size in terms of street intersections .",
    "following the clustering analysis introduced above , when @xmath0 grows after the logistic condensation phase , @xmath7 starts to grow again ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this is because after the maximum cluster reaches the condensation phase , as @xmath0 grows rural intersections and small towns close by get absorbed by the maximum cluster .",
    "in such a way @xmath7 exceeds the carrying capacity @xmath1 .",
    "we define the _ city condensation threshold _ @xmath2 , as the threshold where the measured maximum cluster size @xmath7 intersects the carrying capacity of the fitted logistic function , i.e. @xmath19 . the city is so defined as the maximum cluster at the city condensation threshold , as we show in fig . 1 for london .",
    "in order to investigate whether the city boundaries obtained in this way bear any resemblance with the urbanised space , we overlap the given contours with land - use satellite images .",
    "[ fig3 ] demonstrates clearly that the city boundaries as defined via the condensation threshold delimit the so called _ urban fringe _ ,",
    "i.e. the spatial pattern related to the city s expansion .      in the following section ,",
    "we try to understand the meaning of different allometries that are usually found in urban studies and we examine them in spatial and temporal terms . to pursue this",
    ", we analyse a few simple global statistical properties of the spatial networks : the network total street length @xmath20 , measured in meters , which is the sum of the lengths of the street segments for a given network ; the network area @xmath17 , measured in square meters , which is the area embedded by a given street network ; the street intersection density @xmath18 , obtained by imposing a 400 meters side square grid on the top of the street network , and counting the number @xmath21 of intersections falling in each cell .",
    "these quantities are quite sensitive to the structure of the network and some of them have been considered in different studies @xcite .",
    "the following analysis shows that urban street networks , as defined via the condensation threshold , display statistical properties which are consistently different from the statistical properties of _ rural _ street networks .",
    "moreover , we show that the allometric exponents obtained for the above mentioned properties are compatible for cities in the uk and for cities in california . remarkably , we find that these exponents are compatible with the ones found for the growth of london during the last two centuries .",
    "the network total street length @xmath20 is a global quantity characterizing the nature of the underlying network .",
    "we can write that @xmath22 , where @xmath5 is the number of street segments and @xmath23 is the average length of a street segment , if such a quantity can be well defined . then , considering that the average degree of the network can be written as @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 , where the density distribution for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 have finite mean and variance .",

    "right panel : area of the street network @xmath17 for the historical london dataset compared to the actual uk urban street networks.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we find ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , panel _ a _ ) that for cities in the uk the behaviour of @xmath20 is consistent with a linear function of @xmath4 . on the other hand , for the rural street network in the uk , we find a different behaviour statistically significant for the same quantity ( _ p - value=0.007 _ ) , which scales in a sub - linear way , i.e. @xmath28 . the linear relation for @xmath29 in urban networks is due to the independence of @xmath30 and @xmath23 by @xmath4 , while the sub - linear relation for @xmath29 in the rural network is due to the sub - linearity of @xmath31 for those networks ( see si , sec .",
    "iii ) .    in the case of cities in california ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , panel _ b _ ) , we find that the behaviour of @xmath20 is consistent with that of the uk in a slightly super - linear regime , i.e. , @xmath32 . on the other hand , for the rural street network in california , we find that @xmath20 is sub - linear , i.e. @xmath33 , and it is not consistent within the error range neither with that of the california urban street network ( _ p - value=0.0003 _ ) nor with that of the uk rural street network .    in panels",
    "_ c _ and _ d _ of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we see that the exponent for urban network areas @xmath17 in the uk and in california are quite similar , following a very mild super - linear relation , i.e. @xmath34 . on the other hand , super - linearity can be statistically discarded for both exponents for the rural case in the uk ( _ p - value=0.000004 _ ) and in california ( _ p - value=0.0004 _ ) . in addition , it is important to note that for the rural networks , the exponents for the uk and california are notably different .",
    "linearity can discarded for california , while this is not the case for the uk .",
    "these differences reflect the contrast in the spatial patterns of the street networks covering these two countries .",
    "in particular , the nearly linear relations found for the urban areas reflect the fact that street intersections are generally homogeneously distributed within the urban fringes .",
    "such homogeneity can be seen from the street intersection distributions @xmath18 shown in panels _ e _ and _ f _ of the same figure . in this case",
    "again we find very similar patterns between the uk and california , where @xmath18 is well fitted by a logistic distribution in the case of urban street networks .",
    "this is a bell shaped distribution with a well defined average and variance , while it is ill defined for rural street networks .",
    "the analysis above highlights the fact that urban street networks are characterized by an overall homogeneous texture , which is consistent between the two different countries considered in this work . in the same way",
    ", we can observe how rural street networks differ consistently from urban street networks and between different countries , displaying an overall inhomogeneous structure .",
    "hence , we find that for urban conglomerations a general behaviour emerge in the study of the scaling laws which characterize the global street network structure",
    ".    these hints of universal behaviours do not imply that different cities look the same .",
    "in fact , different urbanization processes shape cities in very different ways , in terms of morphology and size .",
    "nevertheless , the compatibility between the exponents for the analysed quantities suggests that there might be common principles for the growth of cities .",
    "if this is the case , then cities at a specific point in time represent different states of the evolutionary process",
    ". we will then expect to find a similar behaviour if we looked at the evolution in time of a specific city . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we consider a unique dataset recording the evolution of street networks of greater london between 1786 and 2010 , through nine well spaced temporal intervals defined by the maps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( see si sec .",
    "i c for more info ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we perform a simple test , by measuring the aforementioned quantities in the contemporary uk urban street networks and in the historical london dataset . interestingly enough , for @xmath20 in the uk , the historical dataset overlaps with the spatial dataset and both allometric fittings are consistent over a linear regime . as we stated above",
    ", this means an overall homogeneity in terms of the average connectivity @xmath30 and the average street segment length @xmath23 , that is preserved over time . for @xmath17 ,",
    "even if the points do not really overlap , the allometric behaviour is consistent between the time and space averages in the slightly super - linear regime .",
    "two important results can be derived from our study . on the one hand",
    ", we provided a methodology to define city boundaries through spatial urban networks in a universal way . on the other",
    ", we explored the generality of some scaling laws related to urban street networks .",
    "both of these aspects relate to the quest for methodological advancements in the analysis of spatial urban networks , and they relate to the discussion of important statistical phenomena , such as those described by zipf s and gibrat s law .",
    "regarding the concept of city boundaries , we discovered universal properties of street networks related to clustering properties in the street intersection space .",
    "these properties allow us to distinguish the urban agglomerate with a methodology that is parameter free and that reduces the problem to extract city boundaries to a simple clustering process on a spatial point pattern .",
    "the concept of city boundaries is very important to distinguish between urban and rural networks .",
    "we show that allometries found in urban street networks consistently differ from the ones found in rural street networks .",
    "this means that an ill posed definition of boundaries , such as arbitrary administrative boundaries , would mix the properties of street networks that are in two distinct phases of their evolution , producing spurious results ( see si sec .",
    "iii for a direct example ) .",
    "regarding our analysis about the generality in space and time of relevant allometries found in urban street networks , we chose two very distinct datasets , that present different urbanisation paths . while cities in the uk are mostly of roman or medieval origin and reflect a long line of urban evolution spanning two millennia , cities in california are mostly the result of an urban explosion during the latter half of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries . in this context",
    ", we find that urban street networks display compatible properties , even though the datasets are very different .",
    "this highlights how the city is an overall homogeneous structure in terms of its street network quantities ( average degree , average street length , etc . ) .",
    "these findings are confirmed by our analysis , which compares the structure of the urban street networks in the uk with the street networks of the historical evolution of london during more than two centuries .",
    "even if these results are not definitive , a general behaviour for the found exponents can not be excluded at this point and new perspectives of research in this direction are thus opened .",
    "spatial networks are widespread in nature and it is possible to see how the organization of spatially embedded structures are often similar for a variety of different phenomena .",
    "leaf venation , crack pattern formation , river networks , ant galleries , circulatory systems , soap froths , pipe networks and so on , have been studied in a wide range of disciplines which are often strongly related @xcite .",
    "in particular , brain networks seem to share a number of similarities with the organization of spatial street networks , due to their high modularity and fractal structure @xcite .",
    "even though cities present a diverse range of morphological features , we have shown that the boundaries of cities can be identified through universal properties of street networks .",
    "this opens up new research perspectives in terms of the analysis of the logistic parameters for each city .",
    "as cities undergo different stages of evolution , related either to expansion and to condensation phases , those different evolution phases could be easily recognised and classified from the deviations in the logistic curve related to the clustering process ( see si , sec .",
    "ii - a ) .    moreover , from our analysis",
    "we can derive a broad picture of the way a city evolves .",
    "what we observe is that the street network can be found in two very distinct phases , the rural one , which is not characterized by any distinctive properties , and the urban one which is characterized by high density of intersections which are distributed in patterns that are mostly homogeneous and which carry very similar exponents .",
    "in such a picture a city street network develops as an articulated organism territorializing the sparse rural street network , filling the space with denser residential patterns and then radically changing its morphology .",
    "a key advantage of our method of analysis , compared to other existing approaches , such as those based on data extracted from satellite imagery , is the ease of use .",
    "recent advances in gis technologies have led to the proliferation of street network data generated by public and private entities .",
    "our study demonstrates that these datasets can be deployed in new ways to analyse key properties of cities , enhancing our ability to manage the built environment .",
    "a disadvantage of our methodology , as it is presented in this form , derives from its bottom - up approach . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is especially indicated to extract a limited number of cities , as the extraction procedure could not be completely automated and needs eye inspection ( see si sec .",
    "ii a ) . in order to extract a large number of cities top - down techniques , such as the one presented in @xcite are definitively more efficient , even if less precise .",
