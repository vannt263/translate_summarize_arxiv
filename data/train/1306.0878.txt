    "with so many planets now discovered , the focus has shifted to understanding their structure , composition , and other bulk properties so as to provide insights into the processes involved in planetary formation and migration ( santos 2008 ) .",
    "one example of this is the combination of transit and radial velocity data to provide direct measurements of planetary bulk densities  a physical measurement critical to the characterization of exoplanets composition and formation ( mordasini et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "an additional probe of planetary formation and migration is provided by accurately measuring the sky - projected spin - orbit alignment ( or obliquity ) through spectroscopic measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( first observed for eclipsing binary stars rossiter  1924 and mclaughlin  1924 ; first observed for planets queloz et al .",
    "this effect is caused by the modification of the stellar spectrum as a transiting planet occults a small region of the stellar disk of its host star , causing asymmetric distortions in the stellar line profiles that produce a radial velocity anomaly ( ohta et al .",
    "this effect is being detected for a growing number of planetary systems ( see e.g. albrecht et al .",

    "planets are expected to form in the proto - stellar / proto - planetary disk that surrounds a protostar ( e.g. pollack et al .",

    ", we present spectroscopic measurements obtained during the transit of wasp-79b , a recently discovered hot jupiter from the wasp southern hemisphere transit survey ( smalley et al .",
    "we detect a clear radial velocity anomaly due to the rossiter - mclaughlin effect and from these measurements determine that this system is significantly misaligned and lies in a nearly polar orbit .",
    "we obtained high - precision radial velocity observations of wasp-79 using the cyclops2 optical - fiber bundle feeding the ucles echelle spectrograph on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "cyclops2 is a cassegrain fiber - based integral field unit which reformats a @xmath4 diameter aperture into a pseudo - slit of dimensions equivalent to @xmath5 wide and @xmath6 long ( horton et al .",
    "it has replaced an earlier incarnation ( cyclops classic ) which had 15 fibers ( of which 3 were inoperative ) and @xmath7 lower throughput .",
    "cyclops2 has 16 on - sky fibers , plus one fiber for simultaneous thorium - xenon lamp ( thxe ) calibration .",
    "each fiber delivers a spectral resolution of @xmath8 over 19 echelle orders in the wavelength range of 45507350  , when used with the ucles spectrograph in its 79 line / mm grating configuration .    wasp-79 was observed continuously on the night of 2012 december 23 , starting @xmath920min before transit ingress and finishing @xmath92h after egress .",
    "a total of 23 spectra were taken with 800s exposures and readout times of 120s for a cadence of 920s over a period of nearly 7h , with 14 exposures lying in the @xmath93.8h transit duration .",
    "the overall observing conditions were very good with seeing ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and mostly clear skies .",
    "the airmass at which wasp-79 was observed varied between 1.1 at the start of the night to @xmath12 near mid transit and 1.7 at the end of the night .",
    "we obtained a s / n@xmath13 per 2.5 pixel resolution element at @xmath14 ( in total over all 16 fibers ) when it was observed at an airmass of 1.1 and in @xmath15 seeing . to calibrate the observations",
    ", we used both a thorium - argon calibration lamp ( thar ) to illuminate all on - sky fibers and the thxe lamp to illuminate the simultaneous calibration fiber .",
    "the simultaneous calibration system delivers two significant advantages .",
    "first , it eliminates the need for object observations to be bracketed by calibration images , providing an additional 240s on - sky per object exposure .",
    "secondly , the error in the wavelength solution resulting from the interpolation of two bracketed calibration exposures is eliminated .",
    "the data were reduced using custom matlab routines developed by the authors . these use a master wavelength solution obtained from a thar image taken at the beginning of the night and simultaneous thxe spectra taken during each object exposure .",
    "the simultaneous thxe spectra are then used to make differential corrections to the master wavelength solution ( wright and tinney , in prep . ) .",
    "each of the 16 fibers , in each of the 18 useful orders , is used to estimate a radial velocity by cross - correlation with a spectrum of a bright template star ( hd86264 ) of similar spectral type using the iraf task , _",
    "fxcor_. hd86264 was observed on the same night as wasp-79 at an airmass of 1.06 with a 1200s exposure delivering a s / n@xmath16 per 2.5 pixel resolution element at @xmath14 ( in total over all 16 fibers ) .",
    "_ fxcor _ implements the standard cross - correlation technique developed by tonry and davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "fitted gaussians encompassing @xmath17 of the peak in the cross - correlation function were used to compute a velocity ( and associated uncertainty ) for each of the @xmath18 fiber - order ( or  fider \" ) combinations .",
    "we experimented with a variety of templates for cross - correlation , including the highest signal - to - noise observation of wasp-79 and a synthetic spectrum .",
    "we found that the lowest inter - fider velocity scatter was obtained using the spectrum of hd86264 .",
    "weighted average velocities for each observation were determined by first clipping the fider velocities with tonry & davis r numbers @xmath19 10 .",
    "the r number is the ratio height between the true peak and that of the average peak in the gaussian fit to the cross - correlation function ( tonry and davis 1979 ) .",
    "we found that the fider velocities with an associated @xmath20 were unreliable as the peak in cross - correlation function was not very gaussian shaped ( and thus could not be well fit ) and not significantly above the noise in the rest of the cross - correlation function .",
    "after r clipping , a further @xmath21 clip was performed on the remaining fider velocities , from which a weighted mean was computed .",
    "typically , a total of @xmath22 of the velocities are rejected from clipping .",
    "uncertainties for each of the weighted radial velocities were estimated from the weighted standard deviation of the fider velocity scatter .",

    "wasp-79 , then , has a tidal dissipation timescale longer than 95% of the systems examined by albrecht et al . , making it consistent with the observed trend of finding planets in high obliquity orbits in systems with long tidal - dampening timescales .",

    "the wasp-79 planetary system joins a growing list of known systems that are in significant spin - orbit misalignment ( as shown in the study by albrecht et al .",

    "<S> we report the measurement of a spin - orbit misalignment for wasp-79b , a recently discovered , bloated hot jupiter from the wasp survey . </S>",
    "<S> data were obtained using the cyclops2 optical - fiber bundle and its simultaneous calibration system feeding the ucles spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope . we have used the rossiter - mclaughlin effect to determine the sky - projected spin - orbit angle to be @xmath0@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates a significant misalignment between the spin axis of the host star and the orbital plane of the planet  the planet being in a nearly polar orbit . </S>",
    "<S> wasp-79 is consistent with other stars that have @xmath2k and host hot jupiters in spin - orbit misalignment . </S>"
