    "in the current standard cosmological theory , @xmath2-cdm , where the universe is dominated by dark energy ( @xmath2 ) and galaxies by their cold ( c ) dark matter ( dm ) content , dwarf galaxies ( dgs ) are the remainders of the hierarchical structure formation process .",

    "state - of - the - art cosmological simulations , such as illustris @xcite , eagle @xcite and zooms of local group analogues with the eagle code @xcite can now follow the evolution of hundreds or thousands of dgs in one simulation box with increasingly high resolution .",
    "the stellar feedback processes that are especially important to regulate star formation ( sf ) in low - mass galaxies , can be calibrated to observed relations , such as the galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "however not all discrepancies between simulations and observations on the scale of dgs are solved @xcite .",
    "the simulations complement deep surveys of dwarf galaxies in the local group @xcite , the local volume @xcite or in the virgo @xcite and fornax clusters @xcite .",
    "both observations and simulations indicate that very extended ( @xmath3 ) lifetimes are possible for isolated dgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the explanation for their long - time survival is usually found in the dm sub - halo that engulfs the dg , increases the binding energy and stabilizing it against disrupting processes such as stellar feedback .",
    "tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) form in the tidal debris of interacting gas - rich galaxies . in @xmath2-cdm ,",
    "the merging host galaxies are surrounded by a dm halo , but the velocity dispersion of these dm particles is too high to be captured by newly formed , low - mass tdgs which are therefore not expected to be hosted by dm sub - halos @xcite .",
    "observations show that tdgs have active sf @xcite and hence stellar feedback could disrupt the tdg on a short time - scale without a dm sub - halo to keep it stable .",
    "old tdgs are difficult to identify , as their prominent birth - place , the tidal arm , typically dissolves on a time - scale of several hundred myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . without detailed kinematic or spectroscopic studies ,",
    "old tdgs might be hard to distinguish from other stellar objects in the same mass range .",
    "only a few simulations of the evolution of individual tdgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "while cosmological simulations are beginning to resolve the mass scales relevant for tdg formation , the feedback efficiencies are sometimes taken to be functions of the properties of the dm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is not a good strategy for the stellar feedback inside tdgs .",
    "if many tdgs survive for several gyr , then the number of old tdgs hiding in the dg and super - star cluster populations could be large .",
    "the first observational evidence for their long - term survival was found in a survey around early - type galaxies , including the detection of the oldest tdg identified so far , with an age of around 4 gyr @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the evolution of individual tdgs is simulated for 3 gyr . during their evolution ,",
    "the tdgs pass both the apo- and the peri - centres of their eccentric orbits around their host galaxy .",
    "while they are close to the apo - centre , the star formation self - regulates to a moderate level , but the tdgs become significantly tidally compressed as they get near the host galaxy . unlike star clusters , where tidal compression leads to dynamical heating of the stellar system , tdgs are",
    "gas - rich and dissipative processes are important for their formation @xcite .",
    "the tidal field compresses the gas phase , leading to efficient cooling and a high star formation rate .",
    "in addition , this compression helps to stabilize the tdg against the subsequent stellar feedback @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that gas - free tdgs can survive for 10 gyr despite repeated tidal harassing .",
    "tidal forces are often used to study the disruption of objects ( such as stars close to a black hole ) , but a tidal field can also trigger the formation of new systems or increase their stability in its compressive mode @xcite . in regimes where the compression of the tidal field dominates",
    ", an object experiences an extra acceleration towards its centre , reminiscent of an additional gravitational acceleration as e.g. caused by a dm sub - halo . by comparing the acceleration due to the tidal field to that caused by a dm sub - halo of a given mass",
    ", we can relate the evolution of tdgs to that of their much better studied isolated dg siblings : if an isolated dm - dominated dg of a given mass can survive its stellar feedback for almost a hubble time , then a similar tdg at a position within a tidal field with comparable accelerations should survive as well .",
    "we present a fully analytic method to assign an equivalent dm sub - halo mass to a tdg depending on the acceleration due to the tidal field and therefore on the mass and profile of their host halo and the distance between the tdg and the centre of the host galaxy .",
    "the method provides a simple tool to predict or explain the survival of tdgs . @xcite",
    "measured the rotation curves of three tdgs in ngc 5291 and found the ratio between the dynamical and the visible mass to have a value of 2 to 3 .",
    "as tdgs should be free of dm , these ratios are unexpectedly high .",
    "we show that the compression of the tidal field can lead to a comparable increase of the dynamical mass as a dm - halo with a mass equal to the  missing mass \" in these tdgs could .",
    "therefore this method can help to explain an apparent dm content in tdgs .    in sec .",

    "the tidal field at @xmath16 for a test sphere of @xmath7 = 3 kpc at a distance of @xmath8 = 10 kpc to the centre of an nfw halo with @xmath17 is indicated as vectors in fig .",

    "* ) . nevertheless , it is possible to look for regimes , where the compression dominates the expansion , which is the aim of this section .",
    "note that during a galaxy interaction , the gravitational potential will not be relaxed . in principle , the method can be used for arbitrary gravitational potentials if the analytical are replaced by the numerical derivations . for simplicity ,",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .      the net flow over the whole surface of the test sphere , shown in fig .

    "the tidal stretching in some directions is therefore exactly balanced by the tidal compression in other directions .",
    "if the satellite object is inside the mass distribution , then @xmath27 and subsequently the net effect on a static surface is always compressing ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "therefore , whenever a tdg is inside a dm host halo , there is a net compression caused by the tidal field . in a related work",

    "outside the truncation radius , the tidal field does nt lead to the necessary compression for the formation of tdgs .",

    "[ fig : app ] at @xmath147 .",
    "their rotation curves were measured out to 5 kpc @xcite , where their acceleration by the tidal field is comparable to that of a dm sub - halo with around @xmath140 .",
    "this could account for some of the missing mass for the tdgs in ngc 5291 .",
    "as the ring was produced by an high speed encounter , a significant part of the evolution of the tdg was closer to the host galaxy ( indicated with an arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : app ] ) . nevertheless , the tdgs today are on the edge of the regime where @xmath148 and therefore where the expansion dominates the contraction .",
    "if they are not on eccentric orbits that will bring them closer to the host galaxy , they are more likely to get disrupted .    as in the case of ngc 5557 , only little is known about the detailed dm profile of ngc 5291 .",
    "we assume again an nfw potential , but if the disturbance that caused the tidal ring has happened only a few hundred myr ago , the dm halo of ngc 5291 is very likely not re - virialised . in addition , the estimates of @xmath149 and the distances are first order approximations and should be used with great care .",
    "more detailed data on the dm distribution from simulations or observations would allow stronger statements on their future survivability .    in general , the following information can be extracted for a tdg at a distance of 130 kpc to a @xmath0 host galaxy with an nfw dm halo profile :    * at @xmath8 = 130 kpc , the tidal field is much weaker than in the previous example with @xmath8 = 70 kpc . *",
    "the tidal radius ( eq .  [ eq : rtidal ] ) for a an object with @xmath150 is @xmath151 .",
    "* the tdg is located at the edge of the @xmath70 region . at a radius of 5 kpc ,",
    "the tidal stretching in x - direction is even stronger than the compression in y- and z- direction .",
    "in this regime , the formation of tdgs is not enhanced by the tidal field , as less mass can be channelled from the tidal arm to the close vicinity of the tdg . *",
    "the compressing accelerations from the tidal field are comparable to those of a @xmath140 dm halo , therfore the dynamical stage of the tdg could mimic a low - mass @xmath152 dm halo . *",
    "if the tdg moves to larger distances , the tidal radius would increase while the compressing tidal field decreases .",
    "an object like that would be unsupported by any stabilizing extra acceleration field and if it is still gas - rich at this stage , stellar feedback may be efficient in expelling the gas .    if the gravitational potential of ngc 5291 has a higher concentration parameter @xmath77 than the average value of @xcite the tidal field is stronger , resulting in a higher dynamical mass in its tdgs . in order to explain an additional dynamical mass of @xmath153 , as measured in @xcite for the tdgs around ngc 5291",
    ", the concentration parameter of the dm halo of ngc 5291 would have to be unrealistically large ( @xmath154 1000 ) .",
    "note , that rather than making clear predictions on individual tdgs , those objects were chosen to illustrate which information can be extracted with this simple approach .",
    "we have presented a simple analytic method to investigate the survivability of tdgs by comparing the accelerations caused by the tidal field to those inside a dm sub - halo . in this section",
    "we discuss the limitations of the presented approach .    in general , the compression due to the tidal field increases with decreasing distance to the host galaxy ( eq .  [ eq : gauss ] ) .",
    "using our terminology , this translates into higher equivalent dm sub - halo masses and therefore an increased stability of the tdg against stellar feedback processes",
    ". the lower limit on the distance between tdg and host galaxy is considered by a calculation of the tidal radius . while the compression increases with decreasing distance , the volume within which test particles are gravitationally bound to the satellite object , rather than to the host galaxy , decreases .",
    "this volume is characterised by the tidal ( or jacobi ) radius ( eq .  [ eq : rtidal ] ) .",
    "we do not directly include a lower distance limit in the method here , but we compare the tidal radius to the physical extent of the object for the presented applications as an independent test .",
    "another process that limits the survivability of tdgs with smaller distances @xmath8 to the host galaxy is the orbital decay caused by dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "simulations of interacting galaxies have shown that tdgs that form close to the host galaxy ( @xmath155 ) can be re - accreted on a time - scale of a few hundred myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note , however , that the dynamical friction time - scale for a tdg is much longer than for a dm - dominated satellite galaxy with the same baryonic mass , as @xmath156 is proportional to the total mass of the satellite @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we expect a  sweet spot \" at particular distances to the host galaxy , where the survivability of tdgs is enhanced by the tidal field .",
    "the distance range depends on the mass and shape of the dm halo of the host and the analytic method presented here can help to determine this range .",
    "it also allows one to predict the survivability of individual tdgs given their distance to their host galaxies and the masses of their host halos , if the survivability of dgs in dm halos with equal accelerations is known .",
    "the long - term stability of a tdg is favoured if the distance to the host galaxy is sufficiently small for the tidal field to stabilize it against stellar feedback , but also large enough that its tidal radius does not get too small and dynamical friction will not lead to orbital decay on a short time - scale .",
    "we made several assumptions and simplifications :    _ eccentric orbits : _ the method presented here only depends on the current distance .",
    "to predict the further evolution or to reconstruct the past , the orbit and therefore the time - dependence of @xmath8 has to be taken into account .",
    "a highly eccentric trajectory will bring the tdg through very different regimes .",
    "note however that long - living tdgs are expected to move preferentially on orbits with mild eccentricity as otherwise they would get too close to the host galaxy eventually .    _ host halo potential profile : _ we assume spherically symmetric nfw halos for all host galaxies . at the late stages of a galaxy interaction ,",
    "especially after the galaxies have merged , this assumption is expected to be valid . during the galaxy interaction event ,",
    "the dm distribution is not virialised and might therefore deviate significantly from the nfw profile .",
    "simulations can provide time - dependent gravitational potentials and the tidal compression can then again be compared to accelerations in dm sub - halos .    _",
    "c - m relation : _ for all nfw halos , including both the host galaxy and the dg , we assume the relation between the concentration parameter and the virial mass from @xcite .",
    "their relation combines an analytic model for the halo mass accretion history based on the extended press schechter theory with a fit between the concentration parameter and the formation time from dm - only simulations .",
    "we consider the dm profiles of average host galaxies but real galaxies are expected to scatter around the c - m relation .",
    "_ asymmetry of the tidal field : _ in contrast to the gravitational field inside an isolated dm sub - halo , the tidal field is not spherically symmetric .",
    "when we compare the accelerations , we take the maximum compression of the tidal field @xmath58 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tides_general ] ) .",
    "the extension in the direction towards the centre of the host halo is accounted for when the ratio between compression and expansion is calculated . in the chosen geometry of this toy model , the tidal accelerations and eigenvalues of the tidal tensor in y - direction are equal to those in z - direction . in order to formulate a conservative criterion",
    ", we define the regions where the compression dominates the expansion with @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "if the z - direction , where the tidal field is as compressive as in the y - direction , is taken into account as well , the above conditions would be @xmath159 and @xmath160 , which increases the distance range where the survival of tdgs is boosted .",
    "_ internal kinematics : _ we neglect all internal kinematics , such as accelerations caused by self - gravity of the stellar and gaseous components , kinetic stellar feedback or rotation .",
    "all these processes exist and their significance may vary greatly .",
    "therefore , we do not address the very inner part of both tdgs and isolated dgs and focus our analysis on the outer regimes where the dm or the tidal field dominates over the self - gravity of the baryons .",
    "note that tidal compression is more important than tidal expansion , as it brings material close to the centre , where it can become trapped by the self - gravity of the baryonic matter .",
    "for the detailed study of the evolution of individual tdgs or dgs , computationally expensive , high - resolution simulations are necessary . the method proposed in this work allows a quick way to gauge the importance of a tidal field .",
    "_ general remark : _ during the very early stages of the galaxy interaction , the rapidly changing total gravitational potential leads to regions of fully compressive tidal modes that are only short lived @xcite .",
    "these regions can enhance the formation of bound structures . for later stages of the interaction , when the tdg is orbiting around the host galaxy , the method presented here can help to understand the role of the tidal field in the long - term survival .",
    "the two approaches are therefore complementary .",
