    "the newly established electron and photon facilities have made it possible to investigate the mechanism of vector meson photoproduction on nucleons with much improved experimental accuracy .",
    "this has been motivated in part by the puzzle that the nrqm  @xcite predicts a much richer resonance spectrum than has been observed in @xmath3 scattering experiments .",
    "quark model studies have suggested that those resonances missing in the @xmath4 channel may couple strongly to , i.e. , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels .",
    "experiments have been performed at elsa  @xcite and will be done at tjnaf in the near future  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a theory on the reaction mechanism that highlights the dynamical role of s - channel resonances is crucial in order to interpret new experimental data .",
    "building on recent successes of the quark model approach to pseudoscalar meson photoproduction we have proposed@xcite extending this approach to vector meson photoproduction . the focus of this paper is to present the numerical implementation of the reaction @xmath0 in the quark model framework . the reaction @xmath0 shares similar features with the reaction @xmath7 in the pseudoscalar sector , since both are isospin zero states .",
    "this eliminates contributions from all isospin 3/2 intermediate resonances , thus the signals from isospin 1/2 states , in particular those resonances  missing \" in the @xmath4 channels , can be isolated .",
    "thus , investigating the dynamical role of the s - channel resonances and examining which experimental observables are best suited to demonstrate the existence of these resonances is the primary goal of our study .",
    "however , an important question related to this discussion is whether additional t - channel exchanges responsible for the diffractive behavior in the small @xmath1 region are needed .",
    "it has been proposed in the pseudoscalar sector that the extra t - channel exchanges could be excluded with the duality hypothesis@xcite . in a study of kaon photoproduction by j.c .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of the additional s- , u - channel resonances , particularly the higher partial wave resonances leads to smaller coupling constants for the t - channel @xmath8 exchanges , indicating some phenomenological support for the duality argument .",
    "similarly , one could also investigate the role of the t - channel exchanges in @xmath9 photoproduction by including the t - channel exchanges and treating the coupling constants as parameters .",
    "if the diffractive behavior could be described by contributions from a complete set of s- and u - channel resonances , the coupling constants for the t - channel exchanges should be very small .",
    "thus , we include in our calculations the @xmath2 exchange suggested by friman and soyeur  @xcite , who showed that the diffractive behavior in the low energy region can be well described through @xmath2 exchange .    in section 2 , we give a brief description of our model , of which a complete framework has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . the @xmath2 exchange model by friman and soyeur will be introduced in the standard helicity representation .",
    "the results of our calculations for the s- and u - channel transition amplitudes are given in section 3 , and the conclusion are given in section 4 .",
    "the starting point of our quark model approach to vector meson photoproduction is the effective lagrangian  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the quark and the vector meson fields , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are coupling constants which will be determined by experimental data . at the tree level , the transition matrix element based on this lagrangian in eq.([3.0 ] ) can be written as the sum of contributions from s- , u- and t- channels , @xmath15 the first and second terms in eq.([3.1 ] ) represent the s- and u - channel contributions , and a complete set of helicity amplitudes for each of the s - channel resonance below 2 gev have been evaluated in the @xmath16 symmetry limit  @xcite .",
    "resonances above 2 gev are treated as degenerate in order to express contributions from resonances with a certain quantum number @xmath17 in a compact form .",
    "the contributions from the u - channel resonances are divided into two parts as well .",
    "the first part contains the contributions from the resonances with the quantum number @xmath18 , which includes the spin 1/2 baryons , such as the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the nucleons , and the spin 3/2 resonances , such as the @xmath21 in @xmath8 photoproduction and the @xmath22 resonance in @xmath23 photoproduction .",
    "because the mass splitting between the spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 resonances with @xmath18 is significant , they have to be treated separately . since in @xmath9 photoproduction isospin 3/2 resonance can not contribute due to isospin conservation , construction of the resonance contribution is simpler than in the case of @xmath23 meson photoproduction .",
    "the second part comes from the excited resonances with quantum number @xmath24 . since the contributions from the u - channel resonances are not sensitive to the precise mass positions , they are treated as degenerate as well .",
    "the transition matrix elements are written in the form of helicity amplitudes , which are 12 independent amplitudes and defined as in ref.@xcite , @xmath25 where the helicity states are denoted by @xmath26 for the incident photon , @xmath27 for the outgoing vector meson , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 for the initial and final state nucleons , respectively .",
    "the various experimental observables , such as the cross section and polarization observables , have been discussed in ref.@xcite in terms of these amplitudes . in particular , the differential cross section can be written as @xmath30 in the center of mass frame , where @xmath31 is the total energy of the system , @xmath32 represents the mass of the nucleon , @xmath33 denotes the energy of the meson with momentum @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 denote the energies of the initial and final nucleon states . as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the four single - spin observables in _ bilinear helicity product _ ( bhp ) form have the following expressions : @xmath37 for the target polarization , @xmath38 for the polarization of the final nucleon , @xmath39 for the polarized photon asymmetry , and @xmath40 for the polarization of the final vector meson , where the explicit expressions and conventions for the @xmath41 and @xmath9 matrices have been given in ref .",
    "the phase space factor for these four observables are the same as in the differential cross section , therefore , they are normalized by being divided by the differential cross section .    the t - channel exchange of @xmath42 in eq.([3.1",
    "] ) would correspond to @xmath9 exchange which is absent since the photon can not couple to the @xmath9 .",
    "however , an additional t - channel exchange is commonly included even though it is not a part of the lagrangian in eq.([3.0 ] ) .",
    "this is the @xmath2 exchange which is known to be needed in order to describe the diffractive behavior in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "the lagrangian for the @xmath2 exchange model has the following form  @xcite , @xmath43 for the @xmath44 coupling vertex , and @xmath45 for the @xmath46 coupling vertex , where the @xmath47 and @xmath2 represent the @xmath9 and @xmath2 fields , the @xmath48 denotes the electromagnetic field , and @xmath49 is the levi - civita tensor , and @xmath50 is the mass of @xmath9 meson . the @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) denote the coupling constants at the two vertices , respectively .",
    "therefore , the transition amplitudes of t - channel @xmath2 exchange have the following expression , @xmath53 for the transverse transition , and @xmath54 for the longitudinal transition , where @xmath9 in the transition amplitudes denotes the energy of the photon with momentum @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the factor @xmath58 in eqs .",
    "( [ t ] ) and ( [ l ] ) is the form factor for both @xmath44 and @xmath59 vertices , if we assume that the wavefunctions for nucleon , @xmath9 and @xmath60 have a gaussian form .",
    "the constant @xmath61 in this form factor is treated as a parameter .",
    "following the same procedure as in ref.@xcite , the explicit expressions for the operators in terms of the helicity amplitudes can be obtained .",
    "they are listed in tables 1 and 2 for the transverse and longitudinal amplitudes respectively .",
    "before discussing the details of our numerical results , we point out that the nonrelativistic wavefunction in the quark model become more inadequate as the energy of the system increases . a procedure to partly remedy this problem is to introduce the lorentz boost factor in the spatial integrals that involve the spatial wavefunctions of nucleons and baryon resonances , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "a similar procedure had been used in the numerical evaluation of pseudoscalar meson photoproduction@xcite .",
    "there are four free parameters in the quark model approach to the s- and u - channel resonance contributions : the quark mass @xmath65 , the harmonic oscillator strength @xmath66 , and the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath67 from eq .",
    "( [ 3.0 ] ) .",
    "because the quark mass @xmath65 and the parameter @xmath66 are commonly used in the quark model , they are fixed at @xmath68 in addition to the free parameters in the s- and u- channels , there are also parameters in the t - channel @xmath2 exchange : the coupling constants for the @xmath44 and @xmath69 vertices , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and the parameter @xmath72 in eqs .",
    "( [ t ] ) and ( [ l ] ) .",
    "we find that the s- and u - channel resonance contributions alone are unable to describe the diffractive behavior in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "we therefore include the @xmath2 exchange using for the coupling constants @xmath70 and",
    "@xmath71@xcite : @xmath73 and find a good description of the diffractive behavior .",
    "note that the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 were fixed by separate experiments and , therefore , are not free parameters in ref .",
    "this suggest that the duality hypothesis may not work in vector meson photoproduction .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 will be determined from @xmath9 photoproduction data along with the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath74 .",
    "qualitatively , we would expect that @xmath72 be smaller than the parameter @xmath75 mev , since it represents the combined form factors for both @xmath44 and @xmath46 vertices while the parameter @xmath66 only corresponds to the form factor for the @xmath44 or @xmath76 vertex alone .    in table 3",
    ", we list the s - channel resonances that contribute to the @xmath9 photoproduction in @xmath16 symmetry limit .",
    "the masses and widths of these resonances come from the recent particle data group@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the moorhouse selection@xcite rule have eliminated the states belonging to @xmath77_1 $ ] and @xmath78_2 $ ] representation with symmetric spin structure from contributing to the @xmath9 photoproduction with the proton target so that the s - channel states @xmath79 are not present in our numerical evaluations .",
    "of course , configuration mixing will lead to additional contributions from these resonances which , however , can not be determined at present due to the poor quality of data .    in table 3",
    "we also list the partial widths of the resonances decaying into the @xmath5 channel and their photon decay hecility amplitudes . in terms of the helicity amplitudes",
    ", the partial width @xmath80 of a resonance with spin @xmath81 decaying into an @xmath9 meson and a nucleon is @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 represent the vector meson helicity amplitudes and @xmath86 denotes the mass of the intermediate resonance .",
    "the partial width @xmath87 of the resonances decaying into @xmath88 , and contributing to @xmath9 photoproduction , is @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the photon helicity amplitudes",
    ".    only the resonances @xmath92 and @xmath93 , at present classified as 2-star resonances in the 1996 pdg listings , have masses above the @xmath9 decay threshold , and therefore have branching ratio into the @xmath5 channel .",
    "we find that the @xmath93 has a larger decay width than the @xmath92 .",
    "this finding differs from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath92 was calculated to have the larger width into the @xmath5 channel . the photon decay helicity amplitudes in table 3 are consistent with previous theoretical results of the nrqm approach in ref .",
    "qualitatively , the resonance @xmath93 plays a very important role in @xmath9 photoproduction . of course",
    ", since our investigation here is exploratory it can only provide an approximate description of the resonance contributions ; a more accurate approach to the intermediate resonance decay should be adopted in a systematic analysis  @xcite .",
    "we have not performed a rigorous numerical fit to the available data because of the poor quality of the data .",
    "our study suggests that the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath74 and @xmath72 with the values @xmath94 gives a good description of the differential cross section data  @xcite in the resonance region . clearly , these parameters have considerable uncertainties .    fig .",
    "1 shows our calculations for the differential cross section at the average photon energies of @xmath951.225 , 1.45 , 1.675 and 1.915 gev , in comparison with the data  @xcite .",
    "the results for the t - channel @xmath2 exchange and contributions from only the s- and u - channel processes are also shown separately .",
    "our results with the @xmath2 exchange are consistent with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite although the form factor in our calculation is different . fig .",
    "1 clearly demonstrates that the t - channel @xmath2 exchange is dominant in the small angle region , while the s- and u - channel resonance contributions become more important as the scattering angle @xmath96 increases . to test the sensitivity of s - channel resonances to the differential cross section",
    ", the angular distribution at 1.675 gev is presented with and without the contribution from the resonance @xmath93 ; its threshold energy is around 1.675 gev in the lab .",
    "the results indicate that the differential cross section data alone are not sufficient to determine the presence of this resonance considering the theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "since the resonance couplings of the @xmath93 are larger than those of other resonances in this mass region , the sensitivity of the differential cross section to other resonances around 2 gev is even smaller .",
    "in contrast to the differential cross section , the polarization observables show a much more dramatic dependence on the presence of the s - channel resonances .",
    "we present results of four single polarizations at 1.675 gev in fig .",
    "2 . the absence of the resonance @xmath93 leads to a sign change in the target polarization , and the variations in the recoil as well as the meson polarization observable are very significant as well .",
    "the absence of the resonance @xmath92 , also shown in fig .",
    "2 , leads to very significant changes in the recoil polarization . although we do not expect our numerical results to give a quantitative prediction of polarization observables at the present stage , since the calculations are limited to the @xmath16 symmetry limit that should be broken in more realistic quark model wavefunction",
    ", our results clearly suggest that the polarization observables may be the best place to determine s - channel resonance properties .",
    "our results for the total cross section are shown in fig .",
    "3 , in which the contributions from the s- and u - channel resonances alone are compared to the full calculation .",
    "our results indicate an increasing discrepancy between theory and the data  @xcite with increasing energy @xmath97 , this discrepancy comes mainly from the small angle region where the @xmath2 exchange alone is not sufficient to describe the diffractive behavior at higher energies .",
    "one might expect that pomeron exchange@xcite plays a more important role in the higher energy region",
    ". however , fig .",
    "1 shows that our results for the differential cross section at the large angle region are in good agreement with the data , and it suggests that contributions from the s- and u- channel resonances which are the main focus of our study , give an appropriate description of the reaction mechanism .",
    "it is interesting to note that the small bump around 1.7 gev in the total cross section comes from the contributions of the resonance @xmath93 . as discussed above",
    ", our calculations find that the resonance @xmath93 has a strong coupling to the @xmath9 n channel .",
    "thus , this resonance is perhaps the best candidate whose existance as a  missing \" resonance can be established through @xmath9 photoproduction .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a study for @xmath9 photoproduction on the nucleon at low and intermediate energies our results indicate that s- and u - channel resonances alone are insufficient at small @xmath1 and that additional t - channel contributions are necessary to describe the large diffractive behavior .",
    "we find that the s- and u - channel resonance contributions are important in the large scattering angle region .",
    "the differential cross section alone is insufficient to determine s - channel resonance properties in @xmath9 photoproduction , however , polarization observables are demonstrated to be very sensitive to the presence of individual s - channel resonances .",
    "it is therefore imperative to perform polarization measurements in future programs on vector meson photoproduction .",
    "our numerical results suggest that properties of the resonance @xmath93 could be well determined with precise @xmath9 photoproduction data .",
    "given the few free parameters in this approach , the agreement with the data , especially in the large scattering angle region , is satisfactory .",
    "clearly , an improved determination of s - channel resonance properties requires a systematic analysis of all photoprduction data . due to the small number of free parameters",
