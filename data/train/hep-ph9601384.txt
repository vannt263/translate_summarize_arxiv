    "higgs boson search and study of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism will be major goals for the next generation of supercolliders@xcite . despite excellent successes of the standard model ( sm ) in describing of experimental data of electroweak interactions of gauge bosons and fermions , no evidence , even indirect , for the higgs boson sector of the theory has been given yet .",
    "much has been written on the search for the sm higgs boson at hadron supercolliders ( see e.g. ref @xcite for recent reviews and further references ) .    a higgs particle with mass above @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) can be produced and detected in its @xmath11 or @xmath12 decay mode at high - energy hadron colliders because the continuum of massive vector boson pair production is significantly small .",
    "it is generally believed that a higgs boson of mass up to @xmath13 tev ( and larger than @xmath14 ) can be discovered at lhc if the design luminosity is achieved .",
    "the most difficult range of the higgs boson mass to probe at hadron colliders is the so - called intermediate mass region , beyond the reach of lep-200 and below the mass , where the higgs has a decay channel into two massive gauge bosons ( @xmath15 ) , 90  gev@xmath16 .",
    "discovery of the intermediate mass higgs boson at hadron colliders is possible through the rare decays with light leptons and photons in final states , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xcite , or associated @xmath19 production @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the combination of these modes provides a possibility of covering the whole intermediate mass region at lhc only in the case when the @xmath8 resolution is adequate to  resolve the @xmath18  signal  and high  luminosity ( @xmath21  pb@xmath22 ) is achieved @xcite . for the sm higgs boson of intermediate mass primary decay mode is @xmath23 but , unfortunately , detection of higgs through heavy quark pairs is impossible due to large qcd backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the collision of high energy , high intensity photon beams at the photon linear collider ( plc ) , obtained via compton backscattering of laser beams off linac electron beams , provides another opportunity to search for an intermediate - mass higgs boson through the resonant production @xcite @xmath24    based on the @xmath25 linear collider plc will have almost the same energy and luminosity , i.e. c.m .",
    "energy of 100500 gev and luminosity of the order of @xmath26  @xmath27s@xmath22 @xcite . polarizing the linac electrons and laser photons",
    "provides polarized backscattered photons as well as photon energy distribution needed .",
    "colliding like - handed electrons and photons results in a flat distribution of backscattered photons and colliding oppositely handed electrons and laser photons gives a peaked distribution of backscattered photons with energy just below the @xmath25-collider energy .",
    "extracting the intermediate mass higgs signal in photon - photon collisions is a hard task since a large number of @xmath28 background events must be rejected @xcite .",
    "the crucial assumption is that these large backgrounds can actively be suppressed by exploiting the polarization dependence of the cross sections . far above the threshold ,",
    "the @xmath29 cross section is dominated by initial photons in the @xmath30 helicity state .",
    "taking into account that the higgs signal comes from the @xmath2 channel , polarized collisions can be used to enhance the signal simultaneously suppressing the background @xcite ( see also a detailed discussion in @xcite ) . the search for intermediate - mass higgs",
    "requires not only luminosity distribution dominating at @xmath2 . another important requirement",
    "to @xmath8-luminosity is that it must cover the entire intermediate mass region .",
    "utilizing the broad photon - photon luminosity at fixed linac energy of 125 gev provides high @xmath8-luminosity and high photon polarization over the whole region of interest @xcite .    to study the properties of the higgs boson of known mass , the peaked photon - photon luminosity spectrum is more convenient ,",
    "it could be obtained by choosing the collider energy so that the peak of the luminosity spectrum sits at the higgs boson mass .",
    "the higgs boson production in such collisions would provide an accurate measurement of the @xmath18 coupling .",
    "this coupling is induced at the one - loop level and receives contributions from all virtual charged particles whose masses derive from the higgs mechanism",
    ". the measurement of the @xmath18 coupling would give fundamental information about the particle spectrum and mass generation mechanism of the theory .",
    "in addition , a new interesting method has been proposed @xcite to measure the parity of the higgs states in linearly polarized photon - photon collisions .",
    "it provides an opportunity to investigate nontrivial assignments of the quantum numbers for higgs particles in extended models such as supersymmetric theories which include both scalar @xmath31 and pseudoscalar @xmath32 states @xcite .",
    "but the question remains how qcd radiative corrections influence these conclusions .",
    "though it is known that far above the threshold the magnitude of these corrections is moderate for unpolarized collisions @xcite , one can expect that their effects will be especially large for the @xmath33 production in the @xmath2 helicity state , where the tree level contribution is suppressed by the factor of @xmath34 .",
    "we presented our first results on the one - loop qcd corrections to the @xmath28 quark pair production in polarized photon - photon collisions in @xcite .",
    "the lowest order cross section , one - loop virtual corrections and gluon emission contributions were shown to be of the same order of magnitude for the @xmath4 quark production at @xmath5  gev in the @xmath2 channel , while qcd corrections were found to be quite small for @xmath30 . the cross section of two - jet final states in @xmath35 production for @xmath2 even happened to be negative for small values of @xmath3 ( which were used _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite , where only radiative processes of @xmath36 production were taken into account for @xmath37 ) . here",
    "we present complete analytical results for the one loop qcd corrections to the polarized cross sections and to the matrix element of the process @xmath38 retaining the full dependence on the quark mass .",
    "we also carefully analyze the nature of the peculiarities of the corrections for @xmath4 production at high energies in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "we exploit a tensor reduction algorithm @xcite to express the cross sections and amplitudes in terms of the set of basic scalar loop integrals .",
    "this leads to very compact expressions for one loop contributions for polarized cross sections .",
    "recently , the next - to - leading order corrections to the heavy quark pair production cross sections in polarized photon - photon collisions have been also presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where dimensional reduction have been used to regularize both ultraviolet and infrared singularities .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered the effects of the qcd corrections on the background events for the higgs signal from direct @xmath35 production only for higgs boson production at the photon machine obtained from a 500  gev @xmath25 linear collider .",
    "however , it has been explicitly shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , where all backgrounds from two - jet productions were included : direct , so - called resolved and twice - resolved _ etc . _ , that the major contribution to the background at 500  gev is the 1-resolved coming from the gluonic content of the photon , not the direct .",
    "another backgrounds occur in processes where @xmath39-quarks are produced instead of @xmath40-quarks .",
    "since charm production is much larger than @xmath40 production , due to the @xmath39-quark s stronger coupling to the photon , it represents an important background even with good @xmath40-tagging and a low probability that @xmath39-quark is misidentified as a @xmath40 .",
    "the charm background is also not considered in @xcite .    in present paper",
    "we study the effects of qcd corrections on the ability of plc to discover an intermediate mass higgs boson for the case of a photon collider operating at around the higgs resonance based on the @xmath25 collider with energy @xmath41  gev .",
    "the resolved photon backgrounds are much less significant at 250  gev due to a steeply falling gluon spectrum .",
    "we use dimensional regularization to regulate ultraviolet divergencies and introduce a small gluon mass @xmath42 to regulate infrared divergencies .",
    "analytical results are given in sections 24 and appendices a , b. in section 5 numerical results are given .",
    "it is shown that taking account of the qcd corrections reduces the signal - to - background ratio but the intermediate mass higgs boson signal is still expected with statistical significance of about 5@xmath43 .",
    "the influence of qcd corrections on the precise measurements of the higgs two - photon width using the peaked @xmath8 luminosity is also considered .",
    "at the tree level the cross sections of the quark - antiquark pair production in the photon - photon fusion reaction @xmath44 for various helicity states of the colliding photons have the form @xmath45 and @xmath46 we have introduced the following notation : @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the photon momenta , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are quark and anti - quark momenta .",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath2 cross section is suppressed by @xmath56 factor at high energies outside the very forward ( backward ) region",
    ". however , the total cross section integrated over the full phase space is not suppressed , so in the high energy limit the @xmath2 cross section tends to a delta - function , peaking in the forward ( backward ) direction .",
    "complete set of the diagrams describing @xmath57-corrections for the process @xmath58 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this set contains genuine one - loop diagrams and tree level diagrams involving counterterms .",
    "the full one - loop matrix element ( with the corresponding counterterms ) can be written as follows @xmath59 where the set of the operators @xmath60 is given by    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the total cross sections calculated up to the order @xmath61 are given by the sum of the tree - level contribution ( section 2 ) , the interference term between the one - loop and tree - level contributions , and the tree level contribution from the quark pair production accompanied by the gluon emission @xmath62 .",
    "the first two contributions lead to two parton final states converting mainly into two jets , while the third one leads to the three parton production converting both into two- and three - jet final states .",
    "the reason is that three parton final states with collinear and/or soft gluon will appear experimentally as two jets .",
    "moreover , only the sum of cross sections of @xmath33 and @xmath63 production with the soft or collinear gluon is free from infrared divergencies and has no mass singularities in the limit @xmath64 .",
    "so , as usual , we consider the three parton state to represent the two - jet final state if the invariant mass of two partons is sufficiently small @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the invariant mass squared of two partons @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the total c.m.s .",
    "energy of two colliding photons .",
    "2 shows the total ( _ i.e. _ two - jet plus three - jet ) and two - jet ( @xmath70 ) cross sections for the @xmath28 pair production in polarized monochromatic @xmath8 collisions . throughout",
    "we use a two - loop expression for @xmath71 with @xmath72  mev , @xmath73 and @xmath74 as the number of flavors .",
    "we take @xmath75  gev and @xmath76  gev .",
    "the angular cut @xmath77 means a cut on the scattering angles of both quark and anti - quark .",
    "this choice is different from that used in @xcite , where only the quark scattering angle is restricted .",
    "while the qcd corrections for the @xmath30 photon helicities are quite small , those for @xmath2 enhance @xmath78 production by an order of magnitude or even larger . for the @xmath4 production",
    "the situation is more complicated : the corrected total cross section is smaller than the tree level @xmath79 cross section for @xmath80  gev and larger for larger energies .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for the two - jet production .    for small values of @xmath81 the two - jet differential cross section in @xmath2 channel",
    "is even negative in some regions of the phase space .",
    "3 gives the differential cross sections for the @xmath4 pair production versus the scattering angle at @xmath82  gev for various helicity states of initial photons and various cuts . as it is shown in fig .",
    "3a , for @xmath2 and @xmath83 differential cross section becomes negative in the central region of the scattering angles .",
    "this means that for the @xmath4 production at @xmath5  gev all the three contributions ( born , virtual and real gluon emission ) are of the same order of magnitude and perturbation expansion is not valid for too small values of @xmath6 .",
    "this is unlike the case of the @xmath78 production , where the real gluon emission contribution still dominates for @xmath83 .    to elucidate the breakdown of the perturbative expansion for @xmath4 production in the @xmath2 channel at high energies we present the sum of virtual and soft gluon emission contributions in the limit @xmath84 under the double logarithmic approximation @xmath85 it is this large negative double logarithmic contribution which makes two - jet cross section negative",
    "normally , ( and this is the case for @xmath86 channel ) @xmath87 terms are cancelled out .",
    "this is a consequence of the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem @xcite stating that cross sections integrated over all degenerate in energy final states are free from mass singularities .",
    "however , this theorem is trivially fulfilled for @xmath2 channel , as born cross section , virtual correction and soft gluon emission are all equal to zero for @xmath37 .",
    "the cross section of the hard gluon emission @xmath88 in principle is not suppressed in the @xmath2 channel in the limit @xmath37 . but selecting only two - jet topologies for @xmath89 we suppress also the cross section of the hard gluon emission . it is worth mentioning , that cross section of @xmath36 production also contains subleading double logarithmic terms of the order @xmath90 , but they do not completely cancel the double logarithmic terms ( [ asympt ] ) .",
    "consider two final state jets to lie in the central region of the detector with @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath2 cross sections are given by @xmath92 the last cross section was calculated in ref .",
    "we take @xmath93 in ( [ asympt ] ) to take into account a partial cancellation of double logarithmic terms between contribution ( [ asympt ] ) and the hard gluon emission contribution , calculated for finite value of @xmath94 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath95 is equal to @xmath96 and at 100  gev virtual correction is @xmath97 times larger than born cross section of @xmath4 pair production ! for a @xmath3 of 0.02 , as it has been used in @xcite , virtual correction is also @xmath98 times larger than the cross section of @xmath36 production at @xmath82  gev . for @xmath78 production both virtual correction and born cross section",
    "are an order of magnitude smaller and total cross section is dominated by @xmath99 production contribution .",
    "therefore , the approach of @xcite , where only contributions from the radiative processes @xmath100 have been taken into account in the limit @xmath101 and stringent value of @xmath102 has been used to select two - jet - like events , might be relevant for the @xmath78 production , but is definitely not applicable for the @xmath4 production , where higher order resummation of double logarithmic terms is necessary .",
    "however , for a loose value of @xmath70 and a nonzero value of the @xmath40-quark mass the cross section of the radiative process @xmath103 is large enough for the total cross section to be always positive .",
    "note also that in the limit @xmath37 one - loop amplitude itself is infrared finite , so we can calculate the @xmath104 correction in the zero quark mass limit by just squaring the one - loop amplitude @xmath105 however , numerically the contribution ( [ square ] ) is negligibly small in the central region .    as one can see from ( 4.1)(4.4 ) the sum of the cross sections of the @xmath33 production and @xmath106 production with the soft gluon",
    "does not depend on the gluon mass @xmath42 .",
    "the cancellation of the dependence on @xmath107 ( the soft gluon energy cut ) was checked numerically in each case of the two- and three - jet event selection cuts used . for testing the integration method",
    "the 2-jet cross section was calculated in two different ways : as a difference between total and 3-jet cross sections and directly using the corresponding cuts for the invariant masses ( [ ycut ] ) . in both cases",
    "similar values for the 2-jet cross section were obtained .    for comparison with the results of paper @xcite we have calculated the total ( 2 + 3 jet ) , 3-jet and 2-jet cross sections using their cuts .",
    "the results are slightly different .",
    "we obtained that the total cross sections calculated using our expressions are about @xmath108 larger than in @xcite in both cases of @xmath109 .",
    "our 3-jet cross section is about @xmath110 larger for @xmath111 and about @xmath112 smaller for @xmath2 than those from @xcite .",
    "but these small differences lead to larger discrepancies for the 2-jet cross sections .",
    "for example , at @xmath113  gev for @xmath2 we have got 2-jet cross section which is about @xmath114 larger than that from @xcite .",
    "as has been mentioned above , a photon linear collider provides an excellent possibility of searching for the intermediate mass higgs boson through the resonant @xmath115 production . in this region of mass ,",
    "the dominant background to such a process will be the continuum production of heavy quark pairs .",
    "as it is discussed previously , at the tree level the quark pair production cross section far above the threshold is suppressed by a factor of @xmath34 if two initial photons",
    "are in the @xmath2 helicity state from which the higgs signal comes .",
    "so , the use of the @xmath2 dominated photon - photon luminosity distribution reduces the number of background events .",
    "another requirement is that the @xmath8-luminosity must cover the entire intermediate mass region @xcite .",
    "we make here the same assumptions as in @xcite , _ i.e. _ , we choose the broad photon - photon luminosity spectrum resulting from polarized linac electrons and laser light for @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , parameter @xmath119 and geometric factor @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the linac beam energy equals 125  gev and the integrated effective luminosity is 20  fb@xmath22 . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the luminosity distributions for the machine parameters mentioned are plotted .",
    "our task is to compare the signal and background event rates taking into account the qcd corrections .",
    "5 shows the event rates of signal and background two - jet final states in photon - photon collisions at tree level ( a ) and taking into account qcd corrections ( b ) .",
    "we ignore here the backgrounds from the @xmath121 and @xmath122 processes @xcite , which are essential for @xmath123 .",
    "the backgrounds coming from the resolved photon contributions @xmath124 are also shown . while resolved photon contributions make it very hard to observe the intermediate mass higgs signal at the 500  gev linear collider @xcite ( see , however , recent analysis @xcite , where conclusion is done that using optimized cuts still it will be possible to extract higgs signal in the range 110140  gev at 500  gev ) , these backgrounds are much less significant at 250  gev due to a steeply falling gluon spectrum ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "qcd corrections to the higgs decay into @xmath4 @xcite are also taken into account .",
    "we use a cutoff @xmath77 in the laboratory frame and not in the c.m.s .",
    "frame as in @xcite . cut in the laboratory frame",
    "gives a slightly better statistical significance of the higgs signal .",
    "finally , we assumed 5% @xmath78-to-@xmath4 misidentification probability .",
    "thus , the combined background ( _ i.e. _ @xmath125 ) is represented by the dotted line and can be compared with the signal denoted by the solid line ( fig .",
    "6 presents the statistical significance of the higgs boson signal estimated from the tree level and the one - loop calculations including the resolved photon contributions .",
    "this plot assumes a 50% @xmath4-tagging efficiency for the @xmath4 final states and the resolution for reconstructing the invariant mass of two - jet events to be gaussian with @xmath126 . from this figure",
    "one can conclude that it is advantageous to select two - jet final states and to impose the angular cut in the laboratory frame .",
    "the account of the qcd corrections reduces the statistical significance of the higgs signal almost by a factor of two in comparison with the tree - level result .",
    "nevertheless , the intermediate mass higgs boson can be observed in @xmath8 collisions at least at the level of 5@xmath43 in the mass interval from 80 to 160  gev .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the intermediate mass higgs boson is discovered , the plc gives the best opportunity for measuring the decay width of the higgs boson into two photons by measuring the resonant production rate of the @xmath4 pairs , which is proportional to the @xmath18 decay width and the @xmath127 decay branching ratio . to measure the two photon width it is more convenient to use the peaked @xmath8 luminosity distribution , which is obtained for the following combination of parameters : @xmath128 .",
    "for this configuration , the luminosity distribution is fairly monochromatic ( @xmath129 energy spread ) and very highly polarized ( @xmath130 ) @xcite . fig .",
    "7 shows the corresponding @xmath8 luminosity for both helicity states of two photons .",
    "the effective luminosity of 20  fb@xmath22 is assumed and parameter @xmath131 is taken to be equal to @xmath132 to suppress the low invariant mass tail of the luminosity distribution function .    considering only @xmath4-final states , fig .",
    "8 gives the expected event rates for the signal and background processes at the tree level and including @xmath57-corrections .",
    "collider energy is chosen so that the peak of the luminosity spectrum coincides with the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "as in @xcite , it is assumed that a window in the invariant mass of @xmath133 around the higgs mass is used for the measurement and the resolution for reconstructing the invariant mass of two - jet events is gaussian with fwhm=0.1@xmath134 . in both cases the angular cut @xmath77 in the laboratory frame is used , as analogous cut in the c.m.s .",
    "frame gives smaller signal to background ratio .    in fig .",
    "9 the expected statistical errors in the measured two - photon width of the higgs boson are plotted .",
    "for comparison we have presented tree level results with the cut @xmath77 in both c.m.s . and laboratory frames , and one - loop qcd corrected results in the laboratory frame .",
    "again , 20  fb@xmath22 of the integrated effective luminosity and 50% @xmath4 tagging efficiency with the 5@xmath135 @xmath78 contamination are assumed .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "9 , for the above mentioned parameters the two - photon higgs boson width can be measured with the statistical error of 6 - 9@xmath135 in the wide range of higgs mass @xmath136  gev .",
    "of course , a more detailed analysis , including full detector simulation , could somewhat modify our estimates of the influence of qcd radiative corrections on the statistical significance of the higgs signal in photon - photon collisions .",
    "in the present paper we consider the influence of the qcd corrections on the background rates for the intermediate mass higgs boson signal in the process @xmath137 .",
    "we have derived compact analytical expressions for the @xmath57-corrections to the matrix element of the process @xmath138 and have calculated qcd corrected heavy quark pair production cross sections in polarized @xmath8 collisions .",
    "the total cross sections to the order @xmath61 are calculated retaining the dependance on the quark mass .",
    "the cross sections are given by the sum of the tree level cross section , contribution of the interference term between the @xmath57-correction and the born amplitude , and the cross sections of quark pair production accompanied by the real gluon emission .",
    "the last contribution generates 3-jet events and 2-jet events in the case of radiation of soft or collinear gluon .",
    "the contribution of qcd radiative corrections is crucial in the @xmath2 channel for @xmath78 production enhancing the @xmath78 event rate by an order of magnitude due to a real gluon emission contribution , which is not suppressed by a factor of @xmath34 as is the born cross section . for @xmath4 production",
    "the situation is more subtle . for small values of @xmath6 ,",
    "used to separate two- and three - jet final state topologies , virtual correction is negative and of the same order of magnitude as born and @xmath36 production contributions , so that two - jet cross section in the central region is even negative .",
    "the origin of this large negative contribution lies in the double logarithmic contribution @xmath139 .",
    "thus , for loose values of @xmath70 backgrounds coming from continuum @xmath35 production are negligible in comparison to ones from @xmath140 production and one might speculate that the same situation takes place for more stringent values of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , strictly speaking , to safely estimate @xmath35 background for small values of @xmath3 the summation of double logarithmic terms is needed .    as a result",
    ", we have calculated the backgrounds for the higgs signal in two - jet events at plc .",
    "it has been shown that the intermediate mass higgs boson can be observed at the level of 5@xmath43 in the mass interval from 40 to 150 gev for broad spectrum of photon - photon luminosity distribution using suitable cuts .",
    "we have also considered the influence of @xmath57-corrections on the measurement of the two - photon width of the higgs boson using the peaked @xmath8 luminosity .",
    "it is shown that for the integrated luminosity of 20  fb@xmath22 a measurement of the intermediate mass higgs boson width @xmath141 ) is possible with the statistical error of about 6 - 9@xmath135 .",
    "we are grateful to d.  borden and o.  ' eboli for helpful discussions .",
