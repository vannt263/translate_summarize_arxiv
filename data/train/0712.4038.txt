    "cosmic ray ( cr ) propagation is a complex process involving diffusion by magnetic field , energy losses and spallation by interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "diffuse galactic @xmath0-rays are produced via the decay of neutral pion and kaon , which are generated by high energy cosmic nuclei interacting with interstellar gas , and via energetic electron inverse compton ( ic ) scattering and bremsstrahlung .",
    "the @xmath0 rays are not deflected by the magnetic field and the ism is transparent to @xmath0-rays below a few tev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of the diffuse @xmath0-ray spectra and distribution is a valuable diagnosis of the self - consistency of propagation models , the distribution of cr sources and the ism .",
    "the galactic diffuse @xmath0 rays has been measured by egret @xcite and exhibits an excess above @xmath3 1 gev compared to prediction @xcite .",
    "the theoretical calculations are based on a conventional cr model , whose nuclei and electron spectra in the whole galaxy are taken to be the same as those observed locally .",
    "the discrepancy has attracted much attention @xcite since it was first raised .",
    "it may either indicate a non - ubiquitous proton or electron spectrum , or the existence of new exotic sources of diffuse @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "many efforts have been made to solve the `` gev excess '' problem within the frame of cr physics , such as adopting different cr spectra @xcite , or assuming more important contribution to diffuse @xmath0-rays from cr sources @xcite .",
    "a brief review of these efforts is given in @xcite .",
    "in that paper an `` optimized '' propagation model has been built by directly fitting the observed diffuse @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "this `` optimized '' model introduces interstellar electron and proton intensities that are different from the local ones and reproduces all the cr observational data at the same time . up to now",
    ", it seems to be the best model to explain the egret diffuse @xmath0-ray data based on cr physics .",
    "however , this `` optimized '' model is fine tuned by adjusting the electron and proton injection spectra , while keeping the injection spectra of heavier nuclei unchanged , as in the conventional model , so that the b / c ratio is not upset",
    ". furthermore a large scale proton spectrum different from the locally measured one might not be reasonable , since the proton diffusion time scale is much smaller than its energy loss time scale , which tends to result in a large scale universal proton spectrum within the galaxy apart from some specific sources . unlike protons",
    ", the electron spectrum may have large spatial fluctuation due to their fast energy losses from ic , bremsstrahlung , ionization and the stochastic sources @xcite .",
    "another interesting solution , given by de boer et al .",
    "@xcite , is that the `` gev excess '' is attributed to dark matter ( dm ) annihilation from the galactic halo , where the dm candidate is the neutralino from the supersymmetry ( susy ) . by fitting both the background spectrum shape from cosmic nuclei collisions and the signal spectrum shape from dark matter annihilation ( dma ) they found the egret data",
    "could be well explained @xcite .",
    "this suggestion is very interesting and impressive , due to the fact that in 180 independent sky regions and non - gaussian at low energy .",
    "] , all the discrepancies between data and the standard theoretical prediction can be well explained by a single spectrum from dma with @xmath4 gev .",
    "furthermore , by fitting the spatial distribution of the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission they reconstructed the dm profile , with two rings supplemented to the smooth halo .",
    "the ring structure seems also necessary to explain the damping in the milky way rotation curve @xcite and the gas flaring @xcite .",
    "however , the dma solution to the `` gev excess '' also meets a great challenge because of its prediction of the antiproton flux . in de",
    "boer s model , this flux is more than one order of magnitude greater than data @xcite .",
    "the overproduction of antiprotons comes from two factors : a universal `` boost factor '' @xmath5 of the diffuse @xmath0-rays boosts the local antiproton flux by the same amount ; the two rings introduced to account for the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux enhance the antiproton flux greatly since they are near the solar system and are strong antiproton sources . in their work , de boer et al . did not try to develop a propagation model .",
    "instead they focused on _ reconstruction _ of the dm profile by fitting the egret data .",
    "they need a `` boost factor '' to enhance the contribution from dma .",
    "the background contribution from pion decay is arbitrarily normalized in order to fit data best .    in the present work",
    "we try to build a propagation model to explain the egret diffuse @xmath0-ray data based on both strong s and de boer s models while overcoming their difficulties . in our model the diffuse @xmath0-ray comes from both crs and dma directly .",
    "on one hand we do not introduce a different interstellar proton spectrum from the local one ; on the other our model gives consistent @xmath6 flux even when including contribution from dma .",
    "furthermore we do not need the large `` boost factor '' to dma or renormalization factor to cr contribution .",
    "actually , the @xmath0-ray flux from dma is boosted by taking the subhalos into account .",
    "the diffuse @xmath0-ray spectra at different sky regions and its profiles as functions of galactic longitude and latitude are well consistent with egret data . in a previous paper @xcite , we have briefly introduced our model .",
    "full details are given in the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the calculation of the dma contribution in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we focus on the conventional cr model .",
    "as underlined , it explains the egret data , but produces too large @xmath6 flux . in section iv",
    ", we present our new propagation model and its predictions for the diffuse @xmath0-ray spectra and profiles , and the @xmath6 flux .",
    "finally we summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "here , we calculate the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux from dma .",
    "the frame of minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is retained , where we assume that dm consists of the lightest neutralinos .",
    "a pair of neutralinos in the galactic halo can annihilate into leptons , quarks and gauge bosons .",
    "their decay products include a @xmath0-ray continuum and thus contribute to the @xmath0-rays diffuse emission produced by cr interaction with the ism .",
    "the flux of @xmath0 rays from the neutralino annihilation is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the averaged neutralino annihilation cross section times relative velocity , @xmath9 is the differential flux in a single annihilation , @xmath10 is the mass of neutralino , @xmath11 is the distance between the detector and the @xmath0-ray source , and @xmath12 is the spherically - averaged dm distribution , determined by numerical simulation or by observations . the flux in eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) is determined by two independent factors , the first one only depending on the dm particle nature ( mass , strength of interaction and so on ) , the second one depending on the dm distribution only .",
    "the first factor is denoted as `` particle factor '' and the second as `` astrophysics factor '' .",
    "@xmath13 as a function of neutralino mass .",
    "thresholds for @xmath14 and @xmath0-ray kinetic energies are taken as @xmath15 gev . ]",
    "the `` particle factor '' is calculated by doing a random scan in the susy parameter space and choosing models which could satisfy all the collider and cosmological constraints . however , there are more than one hundred free susy breaking parameters , even for the r - parity conservative mssm .",
    "a general practice in phenomenological studies is to assume some simple relations between the parameters . following the assumptions in darksusy",
    "@xcite we take seven free parameters during the calculation of dm production and annihilation , i.e. , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath16 , the wino mass parameter @xmath17 , the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath18 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath19 , the scalar fermion mass parameter @xmath20 , the trilinear soft breaking parameter @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "all the sfermions are taken with a common soft - breaking mass parameter @xmath20 ; all trilinear parameters are zero except those of the third family ; the bino and wino have the mass relation , @xmath23 , coming from the unification of the gaugino mass at the grand unification scale .",
    "a random scan in the 7-dimensional parameter space of mssm is performed using the package darksusy @xcite .",
    "we assume these parameters to range as follows : @xmath24 gev @xmath25 tev , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we find the @xmath0-ray spectrum with @xmath29 gev ( after being added to the background @xmath0-ray spectrum ) can fit the egret data very well , which is consistent with the result of de boer et al .",
    "@xcite . however , the branching ratio to @xmath0 rays varies by a few order of magnitude for different models , and only models with large branching ratio into @xmath0-rays can account for the `` gev excess '' .",
    "we also calculate the branching ratio into antiprotons since the @xmath6 flux is a sensitive test of the dm model .    in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] we give the ratio of neutralino annihilation into @xmath14 and @xmath0-rays as a function of neutralino mass .",
    "we find @xmath30 above the threshold energy @xmath31 gev for @xmath32 gev . for light neutralinos , the variation of",
    "the ratio in the parameter space is at most as large as a factor of @xmath33 . for heavy neutralinos",
    "the variation is very small , and the reason is that @xmath14 and @xmath0-rays are coming from the same final states , thus they are closely related .",
    "below , we choose @xmath34 gev to explain the egret data which predicts @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the threshold energy @xmath31 gev .",
    "actually for @xmath37 between @xmath38 gev the annihilated @xmath0-ray spectra are almost identical .",
    "a few models also show similar branching ratio as in our chosen model ( e.g. , for @xmath39 gev ) .",
    "the astrophysics factor determining the annihilation fluxes is defined as @xmath40 with @xmath11 the distance to the source of @xmath0-ray emission , @xmath41 the density profile of dm , and @xmath42 the volume in which annihilation taking place . in the de boer model , the authors adopt a cored galactic halo model with two dm rings , boosting the @xmath0-ray flux by a factor of the order @xmath5 . in our work we take a cuspy nfw @xcite ( or moore @xcite ) profile .",
    "especially we take the contribution from subhalos into account to enhance the annihilation signals .",
    "high resolution simulations of cosmological structure evolution reveal that in the cold dm scenario the structures form hierarchically and a large number of substructures survive in the galactic halos . a fraction of about 10% of the total halo mass may have survived tidal disruption and appear as distinct and self - bound substructures inside the virialized host halos .",
    "the existence of substructures will enhance the annihilation rate greatly by enhancing the astrophysics factor in eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) .    the mass function and spatial function of subhalos",
    "are given by n - body simulations .",
    "a simple analytical fit to simulations allows to write the probability of a subhalo with mass @xmath43 appearing at position @xmath44 as @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the normalization factor so that about @xmath47 of the halo mass is enclosed in subhalos , @xmath48 is the galactic halo mass , @xmath49 kpc is the core radius for the distribution of subhalos .",
    "the result given above agrees well with that of another recent simulation by gao et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dm density profile within each subhalo is taken as the nfw @xcite , moore @xcite and a cuspier form @xcite as @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the last form is favored by the simulation conducted by reed et al .",
    "@xcite , which gives that @xmath52 , for the subhalo mass of @xmath53 with a large scattering , increasing as the subhalo mass decreases .",
    "small halos with large @xmath54 are also found by diemand et al .",
    "we take @xmath51 for the whole range of subhalo masses as a simple approximation .",
    "we calculate the concentration parameter @xmath55 by adopting the semi - analytic model of bullock et al .",
    "@xcite , which describes it as a function of the viral mass and redshift .",
    "we adopt the mean @xmath56 relation at redshift zero .",
    "the scale radius is then determined by @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the three density profiles respectively .",
    "another factor determining the @xmath0-ray flux is the core radius , @xmath60 , within which the dm density should be kept constant due to the balance between the annihilation rate and the rate of dm particles falling into this region @xcite .",
    "the core radius @xmath60 is approximately @xmath61 kpc for @xmath51 and about @xmath62 kpc for the moore profile .    along",
    "a direction @xmath63 , the subhalos contribute to the `` astrophysical factor '' @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the astrophysical factor for a single subhalo , and @xmath66 is the number density of subhalos .",
    "when we calculate the integration along the line - of - sight starting from the sun , we get the jacobian determinant as @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the distance from the subhalo to the sun .",
    "the minimal subhalos can be as light as @xmath69 as shown by the recent simulation conducted by diemand et al .",
    "@xcite , while the maximal mass of substructures is taken to be @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the tidal effects are taken into account based on the `` tidal approximation '' @xcite , where subhalos are disrupted near the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the total signal flux comes from the annihilation in the subhalos and in the smooth component .",
    "the astrophysical factor @xmath71 ( in unit of @xmath72 ) from different directions .",
    "the almost horizontal lines correspond to the contributions from subhalos only . ]    in fig",
    ".  [ density ] , we show the factor @xmath71 from the smooth component , the subhalos and the total contribution as a function of the direction to the gc .",
    "the @xmath71 from subhalos is almost isotropic in all directions as the sun is near the gc compared with the viral radius @xmath73 of the galactic halo . the largest enhancement for @xmath51 subhalos is observed at large angles and can reach 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "this enhancement depends on the value of @xmath60 , while for the moore profile the enhancement is about one order of magnitude , and for for the nfw profile only about @xmath74 times larger .",
    "the @xmath71 for moore and nfw profiles is not sensitive to @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we also notice that near the gc there is no enhancement .",
    "this is actually a very important difference from the model given by de boer where the `` boost factor '' is universal @xcite .",
    "given the factor @xmath71 and the susy model we can predict the @xmath0-ray flux from neutralino annihilation .    in the next section",
    "we give the background diffuse @xmath0-rays from cr interactions with the ism .",
    "the optimized model of strong et al . reproduces the diffuse @xmath0 rays assuming interstellar proton and electron spectra different from those locally measured .",
    "however , the required fluctuation of the proton spectrum may be not realistic . the works of de boer et al .",
    "have strongly indicated that dma may account for the diffuse @xmath0 ray excess @xcite .",

    "we have to resort to a new propagation model to suppress the @xmath6 further and give a consistent description of all data .",
    "inheriting the advantages of our conventional model in the last section , a new propagation model is intended to be built to account for the galactic diffuse @xmath0 rays , and at the same time the @xmath6 flux .",
    "degeneracies exist between the propagation parameters , mainly between the diffusion coefficient @xmath111 and the height of the diffusion region @xmath76 .",
    "different sets of parameters can all explain the cr data but lead to very different signals from dma @xcite .",
    "if we adopt smaller @xmath76 we can adjust @xmath111 at the same time to give similar prediction of the cr data . however adopting smaller @xmath76",
    "leads to smaller @xmath6 flux from dma since only @xmath6 sources within the diffusion region contributes to the flux on the earth .",
    "the degeneracy leads to about one order of magnitude uncertainties of the @xmath6 flux when adopting different sets of propagation parameters in bergstrm et al .",
    "therefore it is straightforward to consider a smaller height of the diffusion region to suppress the dma signal .",
    "the diffusion halo height is determined by fitting the cr data .",
    "it is found that the average gas density crs crossed during their travel to the earth is about 0.2 atoms/@xmath112 , which is significantly lower than the average gas density in disk of about 1 atom/@xmath112 .",
    "this is explained by the possibility that crs are confined in a larger diffusion region than the gaseous disk , spending a longer time outside the gaseous disk .",
    "the height of the halo represents the volume of this diffusion region . in @xcite ,",
    "strong and moskalenko derived @xmath113 kpc for the four types of radioactive nuclei isotopes of @xmath114mn / mn , @xmath115cl / cl , @xmath116al/@xmath117al and @xmath1be/@xmath75be , while the data of @xmath1be/@xmath75be favored a smaller halo of @xmath118 kpc .",
    "maurin et al .",
    "found that several settings of propagation parameters with halo height @xmath76 ranging from 1 kpc to 15 kpc could well fit the observational b / c ratio data @xcite .",
    "certainly the diffusion halo height should be at least as large as the scale height of the ionized component of the interstellar gas , @xmath119pc @xcite .",
    "the halo height is also constrained by the diffuse @xmath0 ray emission at the intermediate latitude , since too small halo height will lead to too low @xmath0 ray flux at at these latitudes .",
    "since the gas is not smoothly distributed in the disk , crs may travel in low density regions in the disk and may not diffuse to so large a region as usually considered . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the gas density and the strength of magnetic fields are higher than average within molecular clouds : the molecular clouds can act as magnetic mirrors to reflect and confine the charged cr particles . in this scenario",
    "crs may travel in a low gas density region rather than in a region with the average density .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of molecular cloud reflection is hard to quantify .",
    "we assume the gas density that crs crossed is lowered compared with the average gas density in the disk by a constant factor , which should be of the order of @xmath110 since the conventional diffusion model has been very successful in describing the cr transportation .",
    "we find that a reduction factor @xmath31.5 and @xmath120 kpc can reproduce all the data very well , which will be shown below .",
    "it should be noted that the reduction of the gas density crossed by crs is the key point of this propagation model .",

    "the average gas density crs crossed may be smaller than the average gas density in the disk , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this fact tends to favor a smaller height of the cr diffusion region .",
    "2 ) we do not adopt a universal `` boost factor '' for @xmath0 rays and @xmath6 .",
    "since the enhancement by subhalos is larger at large radii , the boost of @xmath6 at the solar neighborhood is smaller than the boost of @xmath0 rays .",
    "3 ) the ring parameters are slightly adjusted , which does not change the @xmath0 ray profile while greatly suppressing the @xmath6 flux .",
