    "there are several reasons for trying to derive inflationary models from an ultra - violet complete theory such as string theory @xcite .",
    "some of the main motivations are :    inflation generically involves energy scales which are much higher than those of ordinary particle phenomenology , and so cosmology seems to be more promising to directly probe string - related physics ( unless the string scale is around the tev so that the lhc can put string theory to experimental test @xcite ) .    the vast majority of inflationary models are based on the existence of very shallow scalar potentials which give rise to extremely light scalar masses , @xmath1",
    ". however , scalar masses are notoriously sensitive to microscopic details since they generically get large contributions when the short - distance sector of the theory is integrated out . due to this uv - sensitivity of inflation",
    "( often called ` @xmath0-problem ' @xcite ) , model building can be trusted only via the knowledge of its uv completion .",
    "string theory has many non - trivial constraints to model building , in the sense that some signals seem to be generic in string - derived effective lagrangians , while others look very difficult to derive .",
    "therefore an observation of these unlikely signals would strongly constrain inflationary model - building in string theory .",
    "two main examples are tensor modes and non - gaussianities since many , but _ not _ all , string inflationary models , predict a very small amount for these two inflationary observables @xcite .",
    "the number of known field theoretic models of inflation could be largely reduced and restricted by the requirement of sensible embedding into string theory .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that inflation combined with particle physics will help us to understand which vacuum of the string landscape we live in , sheding also some light on the particular mechanism through which we end up there .",
    "a complete understanding of reheating requires the knowledge of all the relevant degrees of freedom at inflationary energies in order to make sure that too much energy is not lost into hidden sector particles @xcite .",
    "given that the choice of special initial conditions is crucial for most of the available inflationary models , the knowledge of the full microscopic theory might help to address the origin of these initial conditions .",
    "particular inflationary models derived from string theory predict purely stringy signals that can not arise in any low - energy field theory .",
    "a primary example is cosmic strings @xcite which get formed at the end of brane / anti - brane inflation @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall illustrate the origin of the @xmath0-problem in generic supergravity potentials focusing on the simplest case of an inflaton which we take as a real scalar field @xmath2 ( @xmath3 for a canonically normalised complex scalar @xmath4 ) in a 4d @xmath5 supergravity .",
    "the inflationary potential is given by the @xmath6-term scalar potential : v_f = e^k / m_p^2(k^i|jd_i w d_|j - ) .",
    "[ vf ] expanding the factor @xmath7 for @xmath8 and keeping the three leading order terms in ( [ vf ] ) , we can rewrite the inflationary potential as : v=@xmath9v_0 ( ) , [ vexp ] and then compute its first and second derivatives : v&=&@xmath10v_0 + @xmath9v_0 , + v&=&@xmath11v_0 + 2@xmath10v_0 + @xmath9v_0 .",
    "we shall assume that an appropriate mechanism ensures the flatness of the potential @xmath12 , so that the corresponding slow - roll conditions are satisfied : _",
    "0@xmath13 ^ 21 _ 0m_p^21 . defining @xmath14 ,",
    "we then obtain for the total slow - roll parameter @xmath0 : m_p^2=_0 + + 2 .",
    "[ etatotal ] let us analyse this result separately for the two different kinds of inflationary models :    small - field inflationary models : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the expression ( [ etatotal ] ) becomes : _ 0 + 4x+2(1 ) , [ etasf ] and",
    "so the slow - roll conditions are violated . in order",
    "to have @xmath18 we should start with @xmath19 with @xmath20 which generally requires fine - tuning of order @xmath21 .",
    "large - field inflationary models : @xmath22 @xmath16 @xmath23 .",
    "even though naively for this case the expression ( [ etatotal ] ) becomes : _ 0 + + 1 , [ etalf ] higher order operators in the potential ( [ vexp ] ) become more and more important and the series of higher order operators will give rise to a contribution to the potential larger than @xmath24 even if @xmath25 . in this case , generic string or planck - scale corrections become significant .",
    "this is just an indication that the series in @xmath26 is not well defined if @xmath27 and the effective field theory ( eft ) is not valid .",
    "we stress that for small field inflationary models , the eft is under control , and so higher order operators are less and less important but they can still give rise to large @xmath28 corrections to @xmath0 ( see ( [ etasf ] ) ) . on the other hand , for large field models , the contribution to @xmath0 from dimension 6 and",
    "8 operators are both still much less than unity ( see ( [ etalf ] ) ) , but it is inconsistent to consider just these operators since higher dimensional ones will be even more important .",
    "thus the situation is even more complicated for large field inflation , since one has to check that higher order operators are not generated not just to preserve inflation but also to have a consistent eft .",
    "notice also that a canonical khler potential naturally brings the potential to large values that invalidate the eft independent of any expansion , due to the exponential dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath30 .",
    "hence we realised that inflation is even more uv - sensitive in the case of models with @xmath31 , but why are we interested in this regime ? in order to get observable gravity waves from inflation , since lyth derived the following bound @xcite : @xmath32 ^ 1/2 , [ lythbound ] which can be easily derived recalling the definition of the number of e - foldings @xmath33 and the ratio between the amplitude of the tensor and scalar perturbations @xmath34 : n_e = d r==16=8 m_p^2 @xmath35 ^ 2 , which imply : n_e==m_pn_e = n_e .",
    "[ derive ] substituting in ( [ derive ] ) the value @xmath36 for the scales relevant for the measurement of @xmath34 , we obtain the bound ( [ lythbound ] ) .",
    "notice that @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath36 , and so @xmath37 corresponding to @xmath38 is even bigger .",
    "the present observational limit on @xmath34 is @xmath39 and the forecasts for future cosmological observations are @xmath40 by the esa satellite planck , @xmath41 by the balloon experiments spider , epic and bicep , and @xmath42 by the planned nasa satellite cmbpol @xcite .",
    "hence we need a trans - planckian field range during inflation to see gravity waves .",
    "notice that the value of @xmath34 fixes also the inflationary scale @xmath43 since @xmath44 , and so an observation of @xmath34 would correspond to a direct test of gut - scale physics .    we conclude this section by stressing that in order to solve the @xmath0-problem we need two mechanisms : one to obtain a flat potential , i.e. @xmath45 , and the other to protect the flatness of this potential against dangerous higher order operators . if the @xmath0-problem is present , a @xmath21 fine - tuning will be needed .",
    "this is not desirable but , if possible , is not much tuning .",
    "a non - trivial question is if the fine - tuning is achievable and computable in string models .",
    "a better output would be to find mechanisms in string theory that avoid the fine - tuning .",
    "string compactifications are characterised by the ubiquitous presence of moduli which , after moduli stabilisation , emerge as natural good candidates for inflaton fields . focusing on single - field slow roll inflation ,",
    "there are two broad classes of string inflationary models according to the origin of the inflaton field @xcite :    open string models @xcite ;    closed string models @xcite . in this section",
    "we shall review how the @xmath0-problem is solved in each class of models , showing how closed string models are more promising than the ones based on open moduli since , in the latter case , slow - roll can be achieved only via fine - tuning .",
    "the inflaton is a brane position modulus that parameterises the separation between two branes or a brane and an anti - brane @xcite . in this class of models",
    "it is hard to get a flat potential since @xmath46 but one can obtain @xmath45 by means of warping .",
    "however there is no symmetry that protects the inflaton potential from getting large contributions from higher order operators .",
    "let us see this in the illustrative example of @xmath47/@xmath48-brane inflation @xcite .",
    "the khler potential for the inflaton @xmath2 , which gives the distance between the @xmath47 and @xmath48-brane , and the volume modulus @xmath49 is : k=-3 .",
    "[ kopen ] the volume mode is fixed following the kklt procedure @xcite : @xmath50",
    ". therefore the khler potential ( [ kopen ] ) can be expanded as : k=-3=k_0 + 3 , where we defined @xmath51 .",
    "the canonically normalised inflaton field is @xmath52 , and so also the @xmath6-term scalar potential can be expanded as : v_f= e^k_0 u(_c ) e^|_c_ce^k_0 u(_c ) ( 1 + ) , with the last term in parenthesis giving rise to a large correction to @xmath0 , @xmath53 . thus inflation can be achieved only by means of fine - tuning .",
    "a great effort has been made in order to make sure this fine - tuning is actually possible in string models @xcite .",
    "this illustrates not only how difficult it is to obtain proper inflationary potentials in this way , but also the level of sophistication of string theoretic models which can address this point in explicitly calculations .",
    "moreover it is very hard to get large tensor modes due to bounds on field ranges .",
    "let us see the reason following a simple argument .",
    "calling @xmath54 the radial position of the brane and @xmath55 the characteristic size of the calabi - yau : @xmath56 , we have the geometric bound @xmath57 .",
    "the canonically normalised inflaton field is @xmath58 implying that : = x<. [ dphi ] the string scale is related to the 4d planck scale by dimensional reduction : m_s== , m_p = m_s^4 l^3 .",
    "[ dimred ] substituting ( [ dimred ] ) in ( [ dphi ] ) we end up with : < = @xmath59 ^ 2 , but in order to trust the eft we need @xmath60 which implies @xmath61 , and so @xmath62 .",
    "note that this bound holds also for the warped case @xcite .",
    "the inflaton is either the real or the imaginary part of a closed string modulus @xcite .",
    "the relevant 4d closed moduli of type iib calabi - yau orientifold compactifications with @xmath63-branes and @xmath64-planes are : t_i&=&_i+i b_i^+,_i=(d_i),b_i^+=_d_ic_4,i=1, ... ,h_1,1^+ , + g_j&=&c_j - i sb_j^-,c_j=__jc_2,b_j^-=__jb_2,j=1, ... ,h_1,1 ^ - , where @xmath65 denotes divisors of the internal three - fold , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are respectively the ramond - ramond 2- and 4-form , and @xmath68 is the neveu schwarz - neveu schwarz 2-form .",
    "notice that the hodge numbers split under the orientifold action as @xmath69 , and we neglected the axio - dilaton @xmath70 and the complex structure moduli @xmath71 since they acquire large masses @xmath72 via background fluxes @xcite .",
    "examples of inflaton candidates which are the real part of the khler moduli are blow - up 4-cycles @xcite , fibration moduli @xcite and the volume mode @xmath73 @xcite . in this case",
    "it is possible to get @xmath45 due to the no - scale structure of the the khler potential if @xmath74 and keeping @xmath73 fixed during inflation , in the sense that the inflaton is a combination of the khler moduli orthogonal to the volume mode . in this way",
    "the presence of inflaton - dependent higher order operators can be avoided .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "the tree - level khler potential with the leading order @xmath75 correction reads @xcite : k = k_0+k_()=-2@xmath76 -2v- , with @xmath77 , while the tree - level flux - generated superpotential is just a constant once the @xmath70 and @xmath71-moduli have been integrated out : @xmath78 .",
    "it is crucial to notice that @xmath79 does not depend on the @xmath49-moduli .",
    "@xmath80 is of no - scale type , meaning that : _",
    "i,|jk^i|j_0 k_0,i k_0,|j=3 , which in turn implies that at tree - level all the @xmath81-directions are flat since : v&=&e^k@xmath82 + & = & e^k _ u , sk^|d_w d_||w0 .",
    "the @xmath71-moduli and the axio - dilaton @xmath70 are fixed supersymmetrically by imposing @xmath83 and the remaining potential for the @xmath49-moduli vanishes .",
    "the leading order @xmath75 correction @xmath84 breaks the no - scale structure but lifting only the volume direction .",
    "this implies that @xmath85 directions are still flat , and so are natural inflaton candidates .",
    "moreover the tree - level khler potential @xmath86 also depends only on a particular combination of the moduli which is the volume mode .",
    "thus it is possible to evade the @xmath0-problem since no inflaton - dependent higher order operator gets generated from expanding the prefactor @xmath7 of the @xmath5 @xmath6-term scalar potential .",
    "the next question to ask is if there are further perturbative corrections that might break the no - scale structure .",
    "the answer is yes and they are string loop corrections to the khler potential @xcite : k = k_0+k_()+k_(g_s ) .",
    "these corrections arise from 1-loop processes involving open strings stretching from two different stacks of @xmath87-branes .",
    "these processes can also be interpreted as the tree - level exchange of closed strings carrying kaluza - klein momentum .",
    "therefore the dependence on the khler moduli of these @xmath88 corrections for an arbitrary calabi - yau has been conjectured to be @xmath89 @xcite , where @xmath90 gives the scaling of the 2-point function in string frame , while the inverse power of the volume accounts for the weyl rescaling from string to 4d einstein frame .",
    "the kaluza - klein scale can be written in terms of the khler moduli if we denote with @xmath91 the volume of the 2-cycle transverse to the 4-cycle wrapped by the @xmath92-brane : @xmath93 .",
    "thus we end up with a correction dangerously larger than the leading order @xmath75 one : k_(g_s ) ~_i >",
    "k_( ) ~ , [ kgs ] since we need each @xmath94 in order to trust the eft approach .",
    "this implies that all @xmath81-direction might be lifted instead of just the volume one .",
    "however this naive expectation turns out to be wrong since there is a generic cancellation in the scalar potential of the leading order contribution of the @xmath88 corrections such that @xmath95 even if @xmath96 .",
    "this cancellation , named ` extended no - scale structure ' @xcite , is a property of the eft that is crucial to solve the @xmath0-problem .",
    "let us be a bit more precise about this cancellation .",
    "it can be shown that in the presence of a generic correction to @xmath30 , @xmath97 , and a constant tree - level superpotential , @xmath78 , if @xmath98 is a homogeneous function in the @xmath91-moduli of degree @xmath99 , then at leading order @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "this statement can be proven by expanding the inverse khler metric @xmath101 and then using the homogeneity ansatz .",
    "in such a way , the scalar potential can be expanded as : v = v_0 + v_1 + v_2 + ... , where @xmath102 due to the well - known no - scale structure , whereas : v_1 = - n ( n+2)k , which vanishes for @xmath99 giving rise to the extended no - scale structure , and : v_2 = _ i .",
    "notice that the @xmath88 correction ( [ kgs ] ) is indeed a homogeneous function of the @xmath91-moduli of degree @xmath99 since the volume scales as @xmath103 .",
    "moreover the first non - vanishing contribution to the scalar potential scales as @xmath104 , and so for @xmath105 it is indeed subleading with respect to the @xmath75 contribution which behaves like @xmath106 .",
    "let us now illustrate these concepts in the simple case of just one modulus : @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "the superpotential is a constant @xmath78 while the khler potential including the leading @xmath75 and @xmath88 corrections looks like ( with @xmath109 ) : k= -2v- + .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6-term scalar potential becomes : v= 0 + + 0 + + .",
    "[ vtotal ] the first vanishing contribution is due to the no - scale structure , the second term gives the leading @xmath75 correction , the second vanishing piece is the extended no - scale , the fourth term represents the leading @xmath88 correction , while the last term gives the subleading string loop contribution .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath95 since @xmath110 .",
    "the extended no - scale structure admits a low - energy interpretation in terms of the coleman - weinberg potential @xcite : v_1-loop 0 ^4 + ^2 ( m^2 ) + ( m^4 ( ) ) , [ cw ] where the cut - off is given by the kaluza - klein scale : = m_kk , ( m^2)m_3/2 ^ 2 m_p^2/v^2 .",
    "notice that the first term in ( [ cw ] ) is vanishing in any supersymmetric theory with the same number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the volume scaling of the coleman - weinberg potential therefore turns out to be : v_1-loop 0 + + , which matches exactly the scaling of the string loop corrections in ( [ vtotal ] ) once we make the substitution @xmath111 : v_(g_s ) 0 + + 0 + + .    from this very general analysis of all the possible corrections to the scalar potential",
    ", we learnt that the inflationary potential can be generated in two ways :    1 .   via string loops like in the ` fibre inflation ' model @xcite ; 2 .   via tiny non - perturbative effects like in the ` blow - up inflation ' model @xcite . in this case",
    "the superpotential gets non - perturbative corrections of the form : w = w_0 + _ i a_i e^-a_i t_i , which can then be used to generate the inflationary potential but only if there are no loop corrections since they tend to dominate the non - perturbative effects in the inflationary region : @xmath112 . a possible way - out to avoid the presence of open string loop corrections would be to generate the inflationary potential via @xmath113 instantons instead of gaugino condensation on @xmath92-branes , but one should then carefully check if a high enough inflationary scale could also be obtained .",
    "examples of inflaton candidates which are the imaginary part of the khler moduli are the @xmath67- , @xmath66- or @xmath68-axions . except for the @xmath68-axions ,",
    "their action enjoys a shift symmetry @xmath114 which is broken only non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "this implies that the tree - level khler potential does not depend on the axion field @xmath115 , providing a nice mechanism to forbid the appearance of higher order operators from the expansion of the prefactor @xmath7 of the @xmath6-term scalar potential .",

    "3 .   @xmath45 can also be obtained for sub - planckian axion decay constants by using @xmath118 @xmath67-axions which combine together to give the inflaton direction like in the ` n - flation ' model @xcite where @xmath34 turns out to be large .",
    "] however this model is very hard to realise since the real parts of the @xmath49-moduli have to be fixed at an energy much larger than the axion potential .",

    "if the brane configuration is such that these corrections are absent , then this mechanism works , otherwise fine - tuning is needed in order to get slow - roll inflation .",
    "notice that @xmath170 can become smaller than unity for larger values of @xmath157 but then @xmath171 and the inflationary potential is completely different since it would be generated by string loops instead of non - perturbative effects .",
    "moreover , one should make sure not to hit the walls of the khler cone by taking @xmath157 too large .",
    "we shall now consider a different model where the inflationary potential is indeed generated by string loops .",
    "the ` fibre inflation ' model is realised for calabi - yaus which are k3 fibrations over a @xmath172 base with an additional blow - up mode , so that @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the volume is @xmath173 while the khler and superpotential read : k=-2(v+),w = w_0 + a_3 e^-a_3 t_3 .",
    "the resulting scalar potential looks like : v= a_3 ^ 2 a_3 ^ 2 e^-2 a_3 _ 3 -a_3 a_3 w_0 e^-a_3_3 + , and depends only on two moduli : @xmath158 and @xmath73 , which can be stabilised at @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the direction in the @xmath176-plane orthogonal to the volume is still flat , and so it represents a perfect inflaton candidate .",
    "this direction can be lifted only at subleading order by the inclusion of string loop corrections which take the form : v_(g_s ) = ( - + ) , [ vgs ] where @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 are unknown @xmath28 coefficients .",
    "the potential ( [ vgs ] ) fixes the k3 fibre modulus @xmath180 at @xmath181 . working in the @xmath176-plane and displacing @xmath180 far from its minimum ,",
    "this field can drive inflation while @xmath158 keeps the volume minimum stable .",
    "the inflationary potential in terms of the canonically normalised inflaton field @xmath182 looks like ( with @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) : v = ( 3 - 4 e^- + e^- + r e^ ) .",
    "[ vfi ] the inflationary dynamics is better understood dividing the field space in four different regions as indicated in figure 1 and then analysing each region separately .",
    "[ loops ]    inflation takes place in region 2 where the dynamics is completely dominated by the first negative exponential in ( [ vfi ] ) , and so the inflationary potential can very well be approximated as : v_inf(3 - 4 e^- ) . the boarder between region 1 and 2",
    "is given by an inflectionary point with @xmath185 which develops when the second negative exponential in ( [ vfi ] ) starts competing with the first one .",
    "the parameter @xmath186 becomes of the order unity and so inflation ends . on the other hand , region 3",
    "is characterised by the fact that the positive exponential in ( [ vfi ] ) starts becoming important leading to @xmath187 .",
    "we are still in the slow - roll regime but the spectral index @xmath188 becomes larger than unity in contradiction with cmb observations .",
    "hence we do not consider any inflationary dynamics in this region .",
    "finally the boarder between region 3 and 4 is set by the violation of the slow - roll conditions .",
    "further away in this final region fully dominated by the positive exponential , perturbation theory breaks down due to the fact that the k3 fibre modulus @xmath180 becomes extremely large while the 2-cycle which is the basis of the fibration shrinks to zero size .",
    "this is a nice example of large field inflation since @xmath189 .",
    "furthermore , all adjustable parameters enter only in the prefactor of the inflationary potential , making this model very predictive and leading to an interesting relation between @xmath34 and @xmath190 : r6(n_s-1)^2 .",
    "the prediction for the cosmological observables is @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the inflationary scale is fixed by the requirement of generating the observed density perturbations , and sets @xmath193 corresponding to @xmath194 gev .",
    "contrary to ` blow - up inflation ' , this mechanism does not suffer from the @xmath0-problem in the sense that no @xmath28 corrections to @xmath0 arise at loop level .",
    "being a large field model , loop corrections are suppressed by the size of the field and are naturally small .",
    "the @xmath0-problem is absent because the supergravity potential being almost no - scale is _ not _ generic , while the arguments used regarding the @xmath0-problem assume a generic khler potential .",
    "there is also a symmetry enhancement in the limit of infinite volume .",
    "as we have already pointed out , the action of an axion field @xmath115 enjoys a shift symmetry @xmath114 which is perturbatively exact .",
    "hence no axion - dependent dimension 6 @xmath117-suppressed operator of the form @xmath195 can arise , singling out the axion as a natural inflaton candidate in relation to this nice partial solution of the @xmath0-problem .      a typical axion potential is given by : v(a ) = ^4(1- ( ) ) , [ axionv ] where @xmath196 denotes the axion decay constant which sets its coupling to gauge bosons : _ a^a + ff . in the case of @xmath67-axions",
    "@xmath197 , where @xmath198 is an internal 4-cycle , the axion potential might be generated by a stringy instanton wrapping @xmath198 .",
    "as we have already seen , the superpotential for the lvs is @xmath199 with @xmath200 , and so the scalar potential in units of @xmath117 becomes ( ignoring @xmath75 corrections ) : v= - a_s a_s w_0 ( a_s b_s ) .",
    "we can therefore reproduce a potential of the form ( [ axionv ] ) with the scale @xmath201 given by : ^4 ~ ~~. the slow - roll parameters for the axion potential ( [ axionv ] ) look like : = ( ) ^2 , = ( ) ^2 . showing how @xmath202 only if @xmath203 , but this is never the case .",
    "thus we realise that the potential of a single axion is not flat enough to drive inflation .",
    "the ` racetrack inflation ' models were the first explicit examples of closed string inflation @xcite .",
    "they were both realised in the context of the kklt scenario with one and two khler moduli respectively . in the first scenario",
    "the single - field kklt framework is modified by including a racetrack superpotential @xcite : w = w_0 + a_1 e^-a_1 t + a_2 e^-a_2 t. the scalar potential has a saddle point in the direction of the axion component of @xmath49 . by a tuning of the parameters of order @xmath204 ,",
    "the region close to the saddle point can be made flat enough to allow ( topological eternal @xcite ) inflation .",
    "the main observational implications are a spectral index @xmath205 and negligible tensor modes ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "very similar physical implications are obtained in the improved ` racetrack inflation ' scenario . in this case",
    "the calabi - yau manifold has two khler moduli @xmath207 and @xmath208 with khler and superpotential of the form : k=-2(_1 ^ 3/2-_2 ^ 3/2 ) , w = w_0 + a_1 e^-a_1 t_1 + a_2 e^-a_2 t_2 . in this case",
    "there are two axion - like fields and there is much less room to play with the parameters .",
    "however inflation is also obtained in one of the axionic directions .",
    "the amount of fine - tuning is similar to the single field case as well as all the physical implications .",
    "in particular the value of the spectral index fits perfectly well within the experimentally allowed window .",
    "both these scenarios were important to realise inflation in a concrete string model even if the amount of fine - tuning of the underlying parameters is significant .",
    "the first inflationary scenario based on more than one axion , say for definiteness @xmath118 of them , is the ` n - flation ' model @xcite .",
    "the total action takes the form : _",
    "the equations of motion @xmath209 imply that each axion evolves independently .",
    "however focusing on the collective motion of the @xmath118 axions we obtain : ( ) ^2,= ( ) , which gives rise to the possibility to get @xmath210 and @xmath18 for @xmath211 if @xmath212 .",
    "moreover one can get large tensor modes even if each single axion travels a sub - planckian distance in field space : @xmath213 .",
    "the main obstacle against the realisation of such a multiple axion inflationary scenario is the need to fix all the real parts of the @xmath49-moduli at an energy larger than the axion potential : @xmath214 @xmath16 @xmath215 .",
    "this is the only way to avoid the presence of dangerous steep directions along which the field would quickly roll down destroying the inflationary dynamics .",
    "however in general the non - perturbative effects used to generate the axion potential give also a mass to the 4-cycle moduli of the same order of magnitude : @xmath216 .",
    "for example focusing again on the lvs , @xmath217 .",
    "thus one should try to fix all the @xmath81 s perturbatively , which is a hard task without invoking fine - tuning .",
    "another issue is that one should check that these axions do not get eaten - up by any green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "the first example of a single axion with a flat potential and @xmath218 has been provided by the ` axion monodromy ' model @xcite . the key - ingredient to obtain a trans - planckian motion for a field like an axion which is periodic with period given by its decay constant : @xmath219 , is to use monodromy , i.e. studying how the axion behaves when it turns around a singularity .    in the case of @xmath220-branes wrapping a 2-cycle @xmath221 of size @xmath222 ,",
    "the action for the axion @xmath223 is : s^d5_dbi~-_m_4_2 d^6= -d^4 x . at large @xmath224 ,",
    "the potential can be approximated as @xmath225 , becoming linear in the canonically normalised inflaton @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath220-brane breaks the shift symmetry and gives a non - periodic contribution as @xmath226 .",
    "thus @xmath29 undergoes a monodromy that ` unwraps ' the axion circle .",
    "however @xmath224 appears also in the tree - level khler potential @xmath80 , and so it is not a good inflaton candidate due to the presence of higher order operators .",
    "a better candidate is the @xmath66-axion @xmath227 since it does not appear in @xmath80 .",
    "wrapping an @xmath228-brane around @xmath221 , the potential for the axion @xmath229 looks like : s_ns5~-d^4 x .",
    "again at large @xmath229 , the potential can be approximated as @xmath230 , becoming linear in the canonically normalised inflaton . the inclusion of non - perturbative effects in the khler potential from an @xmath231 instanton wrapping @xmath221 gives rise to a cosine modulation : v~^3 + ^4 ( ) .",
    "one needs again to fix the real parts of the @xmath49-moduli at a higher scale to avoid a possible destabilisation of the inflationary potential , which can be done using warping .",
    "the spectral index is @xmath232 and , due to a trans - planckian field range , @xmath233 , observable tensor modes with @xmath234 get produced .",
    "moreover the cosine modulation gives ripples in the power - spectrum @xcite and resonant non - gaussianities @xcite .",
    "however this very promising inflationary model is missing a fully consistent compact example .",
    "there are several open challenges in string cosmology beyond deriving just closed moduli inflation . in this section",
    "we shall just briefly mention some of them :    * study of pre- and re - heating which is at the moment available only for brane - antibrane inflation @xcite and khler moduli inflation @xcite .",
    "* study of finite - temperature corrections to the moduli potential from the thermal bath . in this way",
    "one finds a maximal temperature @xmath235 that sets an upper bound on the reheat temperature , @xmath236 , to avoid a decompactification limit . in the kklt case @xmath237 gev for @xmath238 tev @xcite , while for the lvs case , @xmath239 gev @xcite .",
    "it would also be interesting to find a model where finite - temperature corrections generate a late epoch of thermal inflation @xcite which might be needed to eliminate relics in the later universe .",
    "* study of the post - inflationary ( non)-thermal history of the moduli .",
    "it is important to follow the moduli evolution in the presence of thermal corrections @xcite , and then study their late time decay with the possible production of nice astrophysical signals @xcite or non - thermal dark matter @xcite . *",
    "derivation of inflationary scenarios which allow tev - scale supersymmetry solving the generic tension between cosmology and particle phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the origin of this tension can be illustrated expressing the inflationary scale as @xmath240 and noticing that the scalar potential in the kklt and lvs cases scale as : v_kkltm_3/2 ^ 2 m_p^2,v_lvsm_3/2 ^ 3 m_p .",
    "thus for kklt : @xmath241 while for lvs : @xmath242 .",
    "the requirement of generating the density perturbations , @xmath243 , generically sets @xmath244 , which implies @xmath245 tev .",
    "+ two available solutions are : 1 .",
    "the volume @xmath73 can be used as the inflaton field @xcite . in this way",
    "a high inflationary scale can be obtained by having @xmath73 small during inflation , while a low @xmath246 can be achieved for @xmath73 large at the end of inflation .",
    "unfortunately this scenario requires fine - tuning .",
    "some mssm realisations via @xmath145-branes at orbifold singularities can be sequestered from the bulk , resulting in a hierarchy between @xmath247 and @xmath246 which might be even of the order @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "these models allow @xmath249 tev for large @xmath246 .",
    "* study of multi - field inflationary dynamics that can provide alternative mechanisms @xcite to generate the density perturbations , which can lower the inflationary scale and give rise to large non - gaussianities .",
    "two interesting scenarios are : 1 .",
    "the authors of @xcite derived a curvaton model @xcite from string theory by combining some features of ` blow - up inflation ' with others of ` fibre inflation ' .",
    "the model predicts large non - gaussianities of local type , but the inflationary scale is still of the order @xmath250 .",
    "a very promising string - inspired scenario is based on modulated reheating @xcite but no explicit string derivation is presently available even if some attempts are currently under way @xcite .",

    "<S> we present an overview of inflationary models derived from string theory focusing mostly on closed string moduli as inflatons . </S>",
    "<S> after a detailed discussion of the @xmath0-problem and different approaches to address it , we describe possible ways to obtain a de sitter vacuum with all closed string moduli stabilised . </S>",
    "<S> we then look for inflationary directions and present some of the most promising scenarios where the inflatons are either the real or the imaginary part of khler moduli . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention on extracting potential observable implications , showing how most of the scenarios predict negligible gravitational waves and could therefore be ruled out by the planck satellite . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by briefly mentioning some open challenges in string cosmology beyond deriving just inflation . </S>"
