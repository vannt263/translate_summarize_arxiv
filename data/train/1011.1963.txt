    "@xmath0 surfaces with non - symplectic involutions were classified by nikulin @xcite , and yoshikawa @xcite showed that their moduli spaces are zariski open sets of certain modular varieties of orthogonal type . in this paper",
    "we prove that those moduli spaces are unirational .",
    "this work was inspired by a recent result of yoshikawa on the kodaira dimensions of those spaces , which is presented by him in the appendix [ appendix ] of this paper .",
    "let us begin by recalling basic definitions .",
    "let @xmath3 be a complex @xmath0 surface with an involution @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 acts nontrivially on @xmath5 , @xmath4 is called _ non - symplectic _ , and the pair @xmath6 is called a _ 2-elementary @xmath0 surface_. in this case , the lattice @xmath7 of @xmath4-invariant cycles is a hyperbolic lattice with 2-elementary discriminant form @xmath8 .",
    "the _ main invariant _ of @xmath6 is the triplet @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rank of @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the length of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the parity of @xmath8 .",
    "nikulin @xcite proved that the deformation type of @xmath6 is determined by the main invariant @xmath9 , and he enumerated all main invariants of 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces , which are seventy - five in number . by the theory of period mapping , 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces of a fixed main invariant @xmath9 are parametrized by the hermitian symmetric domain associated to a certain lattice @xmath15 of signature @xmath16 .",
    "yoshikawa @xcite , @xcite determined the correct monodromy group as the orthogonal group @xmath17 of @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , he constructed the moduli space @xmath18 of those pairs @xmath6 as a zariski open set of the modular variety defined by @xmath17 .",
    "the principal result of the present paper is the following .",
    "[ main ] for every main invariant @xmath9 the moduli space @xmath18 of 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces of type @xmath9 is unirational .",
    "we recall that the 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath19 are double planes ramified over smooth sextics so that @xmath19 is birational to the orbit space @xmath20 , which is unirational .",
    "this fact is a prototype of theorem [ main ] .",
    "kond @xcite proved the rationality of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the latter being isomorphic to the moduli of enriques surfaces .",
    "shepherd - barron @xcite practically established the rationality of @xmath23 in the course of proving that of the moduli of genus @xmath24 curves .",
    "matsumoto - sasaki - yoshida @xcite constructed general members of @xmath25 starting from six lines on @xmath26 .",
    "a similar idea was used by koike - shiga - takayama - tsutsui @xcite to obtain general members of @xmath27 from four bidegree @xmath28 curves on @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 and @xmath27 are also unirational .",
    "yoshikawa studied the birational type of @xmath18 in a systematic way by using a criterion of gritsenko @xcite and borcherds products .",
    "he found that @xmath18 has kodaira dimension @xmath30 when @xmath31 and when @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "after that he suggested to the author to study the birational type of @xmath18 through a geometric approach .",
    "the present work grew out of this suggestion .",
    "after theorem [ main ] was proved , yoshikawa and the author decided to write both approaches in this paper .",
    "yoshikawa s work is presented in the appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "now the kodaira dimensions of some of @xmath18 may be calculated by two methods : by modular forms on the moduli spaces , and by the geometry of 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces",
    ".    we will prove theorem [ main ] by using certain galois covers of @xmath18 and isogenies between them .",
    "the strategy is as follows .    1 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the modular variety associated to the group @xmath35 of isometries of @xmath15 which act trivially on the discriminant form .",
    "the variety @xmath34 is a galois cover of @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   construct an isogeny @xmath36 when @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and when @xmath37 , @xmath39 .",
    "3 .   for each fixed @xmath10 , choose a large @xmath12 and find a moduli interpretation of ( an open set of ) @xmath34 .",
    "then prove that @xmath34 is unirational using that interpretation . by step @xmath40",
    "follows the unirationality of @xmath41 for @xmath37 .",
    "4 .   the remaining moduli spaces @xmath42 with @xmath43 , if any , are also proved to be unirational in some way .",
    "one of the advantages of studying the covers @xmath34 is that we have isogenies between them so that the problem is reduced to fewer modular varieties .",
    "those isogenies admit geometric interpretation in terms of twisted fourier - mukai partners . by this strategy",
    "we will derive the unirationality of seventy @xmath34 by studying just twenty - two @xmath34 .",
    "the remaining five moduli spaces @xmath18 , for which we do not know whether the covers @xmath34 are unirational , are treated in step @xmath44 or already settled ( @xcite ) . in step @xmath45",
    ", we often identify @xmath34 with the moduli of certain plane sextics endowed with a labeling of the singularities .",
    "we can attach such geometric interpretations to @xmath34 in a fairly uniform manner : this is another virtue of studying @xmath34 .",
    "we shall explain a general idea of such interpretations ( section [ ssec : discri cover ] ) , discuss few cases in detail as models ( sections [ sec : r < 10 ] and [ sec : r=10 ] ) , and for other cases omit some detail .",
    "let us comment on other possible approaches for theorem [ main ] .",
    "firstly , as explained by alexeev - nikulin @xcite , 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces with @xmath46 are related to log del pezzo surfaces of index @xmath47 .",
    "thus one might study @xmath18 via the moduli of such surfaces , using the explicit description of log del pezzo surfaces of index @xmath48 given by nakayama @xcite .",
    "secondly , by using singular curves on @xmath2 and @xmath49 as branches ( as in this paper ) , for most @xmath9 we can actually find a unirational parameter space that dominates @xmath18 .    in @xcite ,",
    "those will be developed further to derive the rationality of sixty - seven @xmath18 .",
    "hence one may establish theorem [ main ] also by just studying the remaining moduli spaces .",
    "however , the proof of rationality is delicate and ad hoc , so that the whole proof of unirationality would be lengthy if we do so .",
    "we here prefer the proof using @xmath34 because it is more systematic , short , and self - contained .",
    "we will relate the covers @xmath34 with @xmath32 and @xmath50 to configuration spaces of points in @xmath2 . as a by - product",
    "we describe those spaces as arithmetic quotients of type iv . to be more precise , let @xmath51 ( resp .",
    "@xmath52 ) be the variety of @xmath53 ordered points of which no three are collinear ( resp . only the first three are collinear ) .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the quotient varieties for the diagonal actions of @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the lattice @xmath58 .",
    "[ by - product ] let @xmath1 . for each @xmath59 there exists an arithmetic group @xmath60 such that one has birational period maps @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the modular variety associated to @xmath63 .",
    "one has @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and for @xmath66 one has @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the symmetric group on @xmath70 letters .    when @xmath71 , we recover some results of matsumoto - sasaki - yoshida @xcite .",
    "they constructed a period map for @xmath72 , and then obtained lower - dimensional period maps by degeneration .",
    "the novel part of theorem [ by - product ] is the construction of the period maps for @xmath73 points .",
    "also our period maps for @xmath71 are derived from the ones for @xmath73 , and are not identical to the ones of @xcite .",
    "it is a future task to study the whole boundary behavior of the period maps .",
    "kond , dolgachev , and van geemen @xcite , @xcite , @xcite described the spaces @xmath54 for @xmath74 as ball quotients .",
    "it is also known @xcite that @xmath75 can be described as a siegel modular variety .",
    "thus those spaces @xmath54 admit ( birationally ) the structure of an arithmetic quotient in more than one way : after suitable compactifications , they may provide examples of  janus - like \" varieties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in view of the relation with the moduli of del pezzo surfaces",
    ", it would also be interesting to study the weyl group action on @xmath76 induced by the period map .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : preliminary ] we review the necessary facts concerning lattices , modular varieties , and invariant theory . in section [ sec : 2-elemen k3 ] we gather basic results on 2-elementary @xmath0 surfaces with particular attention to the relation with singular sextic curves . the proof of theorem [ main ] will be developed from section [ sec : r < 10 ] to section [ sec : r>13 ] .",
