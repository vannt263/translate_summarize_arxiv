    "in recent years the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) method @xcite has become a widely - used technique for the determination of ( mono- ) fractal scaling properties and the detection of long - range correlations in noisy , nonstationary time series @xcite .",
    "it has successfully been applied to diverse fields such as dna sequences @xcite , heart rate dynamics @xcite , neuron spiking @xcite , human gait @xcite , long - time weather records @xcite , cloud structure @xcite , geology @xcite , ethnology @xcite , economics time series @xcite , and solid state physics @xcite .",
    "one reason to employ the dfa method is to avoid spurious detection of correlations that are artifacts of nonstationarities in the time series .",
    "many records do not exhibit a simple monofractal scaling behavior , which can be accounted for by a single scaling exponent . in some cases , there exist crossover ( time- ) scales @xmath0 separating regimes with different scaling exponents @xcite , e.  g. long - range correlations on small scales @xmath1 and another type of correlations or uncorrelated behavior on larger scales @xmath2 . in other cases ,",
    "the scaling behavior is more complicated , and different scaling exponents are required for different parts of the series @xcite .",
    "this occurs , e.  g. , when the scaling behavior in the first half of the series differs from the scaling behavior in the second half . in even more complicated cases ,",
    "such different scaling behavior can be observed for many interwoven fractal subsets of the time series . in this case",
    "a multitude of scaling exponents is required for a full description of the scaling behavior , and a multifractal analysis must be applied .",
    "in general , two different types of multifractality in time series can be distinguished : ( i ) multifractality due to a broad probability density function for the values of the time series . in this case",
    "the multifractality can not be removed by shuffling the series .",
    "( ii ) multifractality due to different long - range ( time- ) correlations of the small and large fluctuations . in this case",
    "the probability density function of the values can be a regular distribution with finite moments , e.  g. a gaussian distribution .",
    "the corresponding shuffled series will exhibit non - multifractal scaling , since all long - range correlations are destroyed by the shuffling procedure . if both kinds of multifractality are present , the shuffled series will show weaker multifractality than the original series .",
    "the simplest type of multifractal analysis is based upon the standard partition function multifractal formalism , which has been developed for the multifractal characterization of normalized , stationary measures @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this standard formalism does not give correct results for nonstationary time series that are affected by trends or that can not be normalized .",
    "thus , in the early 1990s an improved multifractal formalism has been developed , the wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method @xcite , which is based on wavelet analysis and involves tracing the maxima lines in the continuous wavelet transform over all scales . here , we propose an alternative approach based on a generalization of the dfa method .",
    "this multifractal dfa ( mf - dfa ) does not require the modulus maxima procedure , and hence does not involve more effort in programming than the conventional dfa .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the mf - dfa method in detail and show that the scaling exponents determined via the mf - dfa method are identical to those obtained by the standard multifractal formalism based on partition functions . in section iii we introduce several multifractal models , where the scaling exponents can be calculated exactly , and compare these analytical results with the numerical results obtained by mf - dfa . in section iv , we show how the comparison of the mf - dfa results for original series to the mf - dfa results for shuffled series can be used to determine the type of multifractality in the series . in section",
    "v , we compare the results of the mf - dfa with those obtained by the wtmm method for nonstationary series and discuss the performance of both methods for multifractal time series analysis .",
    "the generalized multifractal dfa ( mf - dfa ) procedure consists of five steps .",
    "the first three steps are essentially identical to the conventional dfa procedure ( see e.  g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath3 is a series of length @xmath4 , and that this series is of compact support , i.e. @xmath5 for an insignificant fraction of the values only .",

    "@xmath6 _ step 2 _ : divide the profile @xmath9 into @xmath10 non - overlapping segments of equal length @xmath11 .",
    "since the length @xmath4 of the series is often not a multiple of the considered time scale @xmath11 , a short part at the end of the profile may remain . in order not to disregard this part of the series , the same procedure is repeated starting from the opposite end . thereby , @xmath12 segments are obtained altogether .",
    "@xmath6 _ step 3 _ : calculate the local trend for each of the @xmath13 segments by a least - square fit of the series .",

    "here , @xmath19 is the fitting polynomial in segment @xmath15 .",
    "linear , quadratic , cubic , or higher order polynomials can be used in the fitting procedure ( conventionally called dfa1 , dfa2 , dfa3 , @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "since the detrending of the time series is done by the subtraction of the polynomial fits from the profile , different order dfa differ in their capability of eliminating trends in the series . in ( mf-)dfa@xmath21",
    "[ @xmath21th order ( mf-)dfa ] trends of order @xmath21 in the profile ( or , equivalently , of order @xmath22 in the original series ) are eliminated .",
    "thus a comparison of the results for different orders of dfa allows one to estimate the type of the polynomial trend in the time series @xcite .",

    "( [ fdef ] ) will give just this identical scaling behavior for all values of @xmath23 .",
    "only if small and large fluctuations scale differently , there will be a significant dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath23 : if we consider positive values of @xmath23 , the segments @xmath15 with large variance @xmath34 ( i.  e. large deviations from the corresponding fit ) will dominate the average @xmath26 .",
    "thus , for positive values of @xmath23 , @xmath30 describes the scaling behavior of the segments with large fluctuations .",
    "usually the large fluctuations are characterized by a smaller scaling exponent @xmath30 for multifractal series @xcite . on the contrary , for negative values of @xmath23 , the segments @xmath15 with small variance @xmath34",
    "will dominate the average @xmath26 .",
    "hence , for negative values of @xmath23 , @xmath30 describes the scaling behavior of the segments with small fluctuations , which are usually characterized by a larger scaling exponent .",

    "a modified ( mf-)dfa technique has to be used .",
    "the most simple way to analyze such data is to integrate the time series before the mf - dfa procedure .",

    "then the detrending procedure in step 3 of the mf - dfa method is not required , since no trend has to be eliminated .",

    "the example of the binomial multifractal series ( subsection iii.b ) can also show multifractality due to a broad probability density function for the values @xmath3 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath89 is chosen to be very close to one or if very long series are considered , corresponding to large values of @xmath236 , the minimum value in the series , @xmath237 , will be very small compared with the maximum value @xmath238 [ see eq .",
    "( [ bindef ] ) ] . in this case",
    "the log - binomial probability density function will become broad , approaching a log - normal form .",
    "since the scaling behavior of uncorrelated log - normal distributed series corresponds to the multifractal scaling behavior observed in the example of uncorrelated power - law distributed series with @xmath239 ( see subsection iii.d ) , distribution multifractality [ type ( i ) ] will occur in addition to the correlation multifractality [ type ( ii ) ] . for the series with @xmath240 and @xmath185 ( @xmath241 ) considered in subsection iii.b , we observe only type ( ii ) multifractality caused by long - range correlations .",
    "the ratio @xmath242 can also be used to eliminate systematic deviations from the expected power - law scaling behavior that occur at very small scales @xmath243 especially for small values of @xmath23 ( see figs .  1 - 3 ) .",
    "a similar procedure has already been introduced for the conventional dfa recently ( see subsection 3.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "since the deviations are systematic for the mf - dfa method , they occur in both , @xmath26 and @xmath163 , and they should cancel in the ratio ."
