    "strange particle production is a powerful probe into the hadronic interaction and the hadronization process in pp and heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies .",
    "the strangeness enhancement in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions relative to pp collisions at the same energy has been proposed as a signature of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in the relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this is based on the principle that the threshold energy of strange particle production in quark - gluon matter ( qgm ) is higher than that in hadronic matter .",
    "unfortunately , the qgm has not yet been confirmed to be unique explanation of strangeness enhancement .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern opens a new era in the investigation of nucleus - nucleus collisions at relativistic energy .",
    "it has established a new platform to study the properties of qcd matter ( qgm ) @xcite .",
    "strangeness production is one of the most important research topics in the relativistic nuclear collisions at the lhc .",
    "recently , the alice collaboration reported their data of strange particle production in pp collisions at @xmath1 tev  @xcite .",
    "this introduces a new energy regime in the research of strangeness production and the possibility to compare with the previous measurements in pp collisions at @xmath2=200 gev @xcite .    in the lund string fragmentation scheme @xcite , the suppression of @xmath3 quark pair production compared with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) pair production ( the parameter @xmath6 in pythia or @xmath7 denoted later )",
    "was assumed to be fixed",
    ". however , later experiments @xcite have shown that this suppression decreases with increasing reaction energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reduction mechanism of the strange quark suppression has been introduced in the luciae model . by this mechanism",
    ", they described the strangeness enhancement in pp , p+a , and a+a collisions at sps energies successfully @xcite .",
    "luciae is a hadron cascade model based on fritiof @xcite with the firecracker model and hadronic rescattering added @xcite .    in this paper , the reduction mechanism of the strange quark suppression was introduced in the parton and hadron cascade model paciae @xcite and denoted as the modified paciae model to distinguish it from the default one .",
    "the modified paciae model was then used to systematically investigate the strange particle production in pp collisions at the rhic and lhc energies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review the paciae model @xcite and the reduction mechanism of strangeness quark suppression @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we use the modified parton and hadron cascade model paciae based on pythia @xcite to analyze systematically the strangeness production in pp collisions at rhic and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio as a function of reaction energy in pp collisions at relativistic energies from sps to lhc was also investigated in sec.iii .",
    "section iv gives a summary and conclusion .",
    "paciae @xcite is a parton and hadron cascade model based on pythia @xcite which is a model for high energy hadron - hadron ( hh ) collisions at the hadronic level . in the pythia model",
    ", a pp collision is decomposed into parton - parton collisions .",
    "the hard parton - parton interaction is described by the lowest leading order perturbative qcd ( lo - pqcd ) .",
    "the soft parton - parton collision , a non - perturbative phenomenon , is considered empirically .",
    "the initial- and final - state qcd radiations , as well as the multiparton interactions , are considered .",
    "therefore the consequence of a pp collision is a parton multijet configuration composed of quarks ( anti - quarks ) , di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) and gluons , along with a few hadronic remnants .",
    "after that , the string construction and fragmentation ( hadronization ) are preformed to obtain a hadronic final state for a pp collision .    for the pp collision",
    ", the paciae model is different from pythia in the addition of the parton initiation stage , the parton rescattering before hadronization , and the hadron rescattering after hadronization .",
    "thus , the paciae model consists of the parton initiation , parton evolution ( rescattering ) , hadronization , and hadron evolution ( rescattering ) four stages .    in order to create the parton initiation stage for a pp collision",
    ", the string fragmentation is switched off temporarily in paciae .",
    "the di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) are broken up .",
    "then the partonic initial state is obtained in the paciae model , instead of the hadronic final state in pythia .",
    "this is just qgm formed in the parton initiation stage of a pp collision .",
    "the rescattering among partons in qgm is considered by the @xmath8 lo pqcd parton - parton cross sections @xcite . by integrating this differential cross section properly",
    ", the total cross section is obtained . with the differential and total cross sections",
    ", parton rescattering is performed by the monte carlo method .    in the hadronization stage",
    ", the qgm formed after parton rescattering is hadronized by the lund string fragmentation regime @xcite or the monte carlo coalescence model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the lund string fragmentation is used in this paper .",
    "the hadronic rescattering is modeled with the usual two body elastic and/or inelastic collisions @xcite , until the hh collision pairs are exhausted ( hadronic freeze - out ) .",
    "the rescatterings among @xmath9 and their antiparticles are considered for the moment .    in the pythia model @xcite , it is assumed that the @xmath10 pair with quark mass @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath12 is first created quantum mechanically at one point and then tunnel out to the classically allowed region .",
    "this tunnelling probability is calculated @xmath13 where the string tension is assumed to be a constant of @xmath141 gev/@xmath15 gev@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this probability implies a suppression of strange ( heavy ) quark production : @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the charm and heavier quarks are not expected to be produced in the soft string fragmentation process but only in the hard process or as a part of the initial- and final - state qcd radiations .",
    "a reduction mechanism of strange quark suppression was introduced in @xcite by assuming that the effective string tension increased with increasing reaction energy .",
    "hence the strange ( heavy ) quark production increased with increasing reaction energy .",
    "it was further assumed in @xcite that the effective string tension variation with reaction energy could be considered by the effective string tension as a function of the number and the hardening of gluons in a single string as follows : @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the string tension of a pure @xmath21 string , assumed to be @xmath22 gev / fm . here",
    "it should be mentioned that the above eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) represents the deviation scale of the multigluon string from the pure string .",
    "the gluons in a multigluon string are ordered from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , because of the quark and antiquark on both ends of string with index @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the transverse momentum of gluon @xmath29 with @xmath30 ( gluon largest transverse momentum ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath31=3.5 gev and @xmath32=0.8 gev were determined by fitting the hh collision data @xcite .    the strange quark suppression factor @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath6 in pythia ) and the width @xmath33 ( @xmath34 in pythia ) of the gaussian @xmath35 and @xmath36 transverse momentum distributions of the primary hadrons , in a string with effective string tension @xmath37 , are denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "these two quantities in a string with effective string tension @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , can be calculated by eq .",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44    in the pythia model there are parameters parj(1 ) and parj(3 ) related to strangeness production , besides parj(2 ) and parj(21 ) .",
    "parj(1 ) is the suppression of diquark - antidiquark pair production relative to the quark - antiquark pair production .",
    "parj(3 ) refers to the extra suppression of strange diquark production relative to the normal suppression of strange quark production . for double strange particle ( strange baryon ) production , parj(1 ) and parj(3 )",
    "have to be considered as well .",
    "it is not hard to prove that the eq .",
    "is also valid for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the reduction mechanism of the strange quark suppression has been included in the paciae model .",
    "one might first tune the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath6 , and @xmath46 to fit the strangeness production data in a given nuclear collision system at a given energy .",
    "the resulting @xmath45 , @xmath6 , and @xmath46 and the effective string tension can be used to predict the strangeness production in the same reaction system at different energies , even in different reaction systems .",
    "as we aimed at the physics behind the strange particle production and not at the reproduction of experimental data , we kept all model parameters at their default values .",
    "however , the higher order and non - perturbative correction factor in parton - parton interaction , @xmath47 , was assumed to be 3 .",
    "we then first globally tuned the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath6 , and @xmath46 in default paciae simulations to fit the strangeness production data from nsd ( non single diffractive ) pp collisions at @xmath48=200 gev @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in tab .  [ 200 ] along with the results from default pythia simulations . from this table , we find that the star data are better described by default paciae model rather than by the default pythia model .    the strange particle transverse momentum spectra in the nsd pp collisions at @xmath48=200 gev calculated by the default paciae and default pythia are shown in fig .  [ star ] .",
    "the corresponding star data @xcite are also given .",
    "the panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that , globally speaking , the strange particle @xmath12 spectrum is better described by the default paciae rather than the default pythia model . here , the role of parton and hadron rescatterings is also not negligible .",
    "the fitted parameters of @xmath45=0.18 , @xmath6=0.4 , and @xmath46=0.5 as well as the calculated @xmath52=1.387 were then used to calculate the strange particle production in inel ( inelastic ) pp collisions at @xmath48=900 gev by the modified paciae model .",
    "the resulting strange particle rapidity densities at mid - rapidity were compared with the alice data @xcite as well as the results of default pythia in tab .  [ 900 ] .",
    "one sees in this table that the alice data are better reproduced by modified paciae , rather than the default pythia model .",
    "the effects of the reduction mechanism of strange quark suppression and the parton and hadron rescatterings may be all important which has to be separately studied .",
    "we present the strange particle transverse momentum distributions in inel pp collisions at @xmath48=900 gev calculated by the modified paciae and default pythia models in fig .",
    "[ alice ] .",
    "the corresponding alice data @xcite are also given .",
    "the panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) are for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51+@xmath55 , respectively .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "[ alice ] that the modified paciae results fit well with the alice data for the light strange particle @xmath53 .",
    "however , for the @xmath54 meson and the heavy strange baryons ( @xmath50 and @xmath51+@xmath55 ) the modified paciae model overestimates the data in the @xmath561 gev / c region . this may be because we only used the default paciae to tune the parameters to the data of strange particle rapidity densities at mid - rapidity in @xmath57=200 gev pp collisions @xcite . in this sense , the transverse momentum distribution is calculated parameter free . therefore , even if the calculated strange particle rapidity densities at mid - rapidity are close to the data ( cf . tab .  [ 200 ] and tab .  [ 900 ] ) , the calculated transverse momentum distribution may not be closely similar to the data .",
    "thus , the calculated transverse momentum distribution is softer than the data in the @xmath581 gev / c region , but harder in the @xmath561 gev / c region . it might also be possible that the reduction mechanism of strange quark suppression is not so suitable for the heavy strange baryons",
    "therefore , the role played by the reduction mechanism of strange quark suppression and the parton and hadron rescatterings are worthy to be separately studied in the next investigations .    similarly , the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in inel pp collisions at @xmath48=2.36 , 7 , and 14 tev were predicted by the modified paciae model and given in fig .  [ predi ] .",
    "these results are prepared to compare with the future experimental measurements at the lhc .    in @xcite , the experimental kaon to pion ratios in pp and/or",
    "@xmath59 collisions at different reaction energies from sps to lhc were plotted in a @xmath0 verses @xmath48 figure , although their experimental details in the measured observable ( @xmath60 , or ( @xmath61)/(@xmath62 ) , or @xmath63 ) and the rapidity acceptance were different from each other .",
    "these experimental ratios are copied in fig .",
    "[ kpi ] . in this figure ,",
    "na49 , star , alice , e735 , and ua5 data were taken from  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively . in @xcite , it was concluded that the  ratio shows a slight increase from @xmath48=200 gev ( @xmath64 ) to @xmath48=900 gev ( @xmath65 ) , yet consistent within the error bars .",
    "the results at 7 tev will show whether the @xmath0 ratio keeps rising slowly as a function of @xmath48 or saturates . \" to respond to this challenge the ( @xmath61)/(@xmath66 ) ratio was extracted from the above paciae model simulations for pp collisions at @xmath48=0.2 , 0.9 , 2.36 , 7 , and 14 tev and given in fig .",
    "[ kpi ] by red triangles .",
    "in addition , the default paciae and pythia models were used to calculate the na49 ( @xmath61)/(@xmath66 ) ratio in pp collisions at 158 gev / c beam momentum .",
    "the model parameters employed in these calculations were the same as the ones used in the above simulations , except @xmath47=1 was assumed because of the low energy .",
    "we find in fig .",
    "[ kpi ] that the paciae results at @xmath48=17.2 , 200 and 900 gev agree with the na49 , star , and alice data , respectively , within error . together with the paciae results at @xmath48=2.36 , 7 , and 14 tev",
    ", it seems to indicate that the @xmath0 ratio as a function of @xmath48 first increases slightly from @xmath48=0.2 to 0.9 tev and then saturates .",
    "of course , this rough trend of the @xmath60 ratio as a function of @xmath48 in pp reactions has to be further studied in detail both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "in summary , we used the parton and hadron cascade model paciae with the reduction mechanism of the strange quark suppression and default pythia models to systematically investigate the production of strange particles in nsd and inel pp collisions at @xmath48=200 gev and @xmath48=0.9 , 2.36 , 7 , and 14 tev , respectively .",
    "the calculated strangeness transverse momentum distributions in nsd pp collisions at @xmath48=200 gev compare well with the star data @xcite and paciae is globally better than the default pythia model .",
    "we also compared the calculated strange particle rapidity densities at mid - rapidity and transverse momentum distributions in inel pp collisions at @xmath48=0.9 tev with the corresponding alice data @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is good and the paciae is globally better than the default pythia model .",
    "this may indicate the significant effect of the parton and hadron rescatterings , as well as the reduction mechanism of strange quark suppression .",
    "these effects are worth investigating separately .",
    "the @xmath0 ratios calculated by paciae in nsd pp collisions at @xmath48=0.2 tev and in inel pp collisions at @xmath48=0.9 tev agree with the corresponding star @xcite and alice data @xcite , respectively , within error .",
    "the paciae model result in pp collisions at 158 gev / c beam momentum is also comparable with na49 data @xcite .",
    "the rough trend of the @xmath0 ratio as function of @xmath48 shown in fig .",
    "[ kpi ] seems to be first increasing moderately , then slightly , and finally saturating .",
    "this trend has to be studied in detail both experimentally and theoretically .    just before the submission of this paper , we read the paper of @xcite and knew that the cms measured ",
    "@xmath12 distributions are found to differ substantially from pythia results and the production rates exceed the predictions by up to a factor of three . \"",
    "note , here pythia refers to a variety of pythia tunes quoted in @xcite .",
    "we use the modified paciae model to calculate the corresponding values .",
    "the calculated @xmath67= 0.238 , 0.102 , and 0.0113 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 compare well with the cms data of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xcite in nsd pp collisions at @xmath48=0.9 tev , respectively .",
