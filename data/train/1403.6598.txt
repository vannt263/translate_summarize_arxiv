    "our interest is to understand the long term behavior of the orbits under @xmath2 , in terms of their initial condition .",
    "the dynamical plane splits into two totally invariant sets ; the set of points with stable behavior , i.e. , the domain of normality of the iterates @xmath3 , and its complement , i.e. , the set of points with nonstable behavior .",
    "these two sets are called the _ fatou set _ and the _ julia set _ , respectively . understanding the topology of these complementary sets is one of the main goals in the field .",
    "another dynamically relevant set is the _ escaping set _ , which consists of orbits that escape to infinity under iteration of @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the nature of the entire map ( i.e. , whether a polynomial , or transcendental ) , its escaping set is associated to either the fatou set , or the julia set .    in this paper",
    "we study some special objects known as `` dynamic rays '' which play an essential role in studying the topological structure of the julia set . roughly speaking , dynamic rays are unbounded curves formed by orbits which escape to infinity following a given pattern , that is , according to some symbolic dynamics structure . in polynomial dynamics ,",
    "dynamic rays are part of the fatou set , since the point at infinity is superattracting , and belongs to the fatou set .",
    "instead , in transcendental dynamics , infinity is an essential singularity , and hence dynamic rays belong to the julia set . to start with",
    ", we look at dynamic rays for polynomials following @xcite , where the concept of rays was first introduced .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath4 .",
    "then the point at infinity is a superattracting fixed point with multiplicity @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the _ filled - in julia set _ of @xmath2 , i.e. , the set of all points with bounded orbit . if @xmath6 is connected , or equivalently , if @xmath6 contains all finite zeroes of @xmath7 ( known as _",
    "critical points _ of @xmath2 ) , then the locally defined bttcher map -which conjugates the dynamics near @xmath8 to @xmath9 near @xmath8- extends to a conformal isomorphism @xmath10 . _ a dynamic ray of argument @xmath11 _",
    "is defined by the inverse image @xmath12 , which we denote by @xmath13 .",
    "a dynamic ray @xmath13 is @xmath14-periodic , if there exists a minimal number @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , or equivalently @xmath17 .",
    "we say that @xmath13 lands at some point if @xmath18 is a singleton . the famous landing theorem by douady and hubbard ( see ( * ? ?",
    "* chpt 8 , prop 8.4 ) ) states that for a polynomial of degree @xmath4 , if @xmath6 is connected , then every periodic dynamic ray lands at a periodic point , which is either repelling or parabolic .    in transcendental entire dynamics , the point at infinity is not suitable for constructing rays in the same way as for polynomials",
    "however , for a large class of transcendental maps , there exist curves in the julia set , consisting of points escaping to @xmath8 under forward iterates .",
    "this structure is considered to be analogous to the dynamic rays in polynomial dynamics .",
    "because of the similarity , those curves are also called dynamic rays , or sometimes hairs .",
    "many studies have been carried out to prove existence theorems for different classes of transcendental entire functions .",
    "devaney and krych in 1984 discovered that for exponential functions @xmath19 for @xmath20 , the escaping set consists of curves tending to @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this study was generalized by devaney et .",
    "al . to exponential maps satisfying certain conditions ( @xcite ) , and was finally completed for arbitrary maps in this family in @xcite .    the investigation of dynamic rays in larger classes of transcendental maps started in 1986 by devaney and tangerman ( @xcite ) .",
    "they observed the ray structure in classes of transcendental maps having some similarities with the exponential family .",
    "later , baranski in @xcite , proved the existence of dynamics rays for hyperbolic maps of finite order which have one completely invariant fatou component .",
    "a recent work @xcite by rottenfusser , rckert , rempe and schleicher covers all the previous results as well as gives a proof of existence of rays in a more general class of maps .",
    "according to their work , dynamic rays exist for a class of transcendental entire maps which include those of finite order with bounded singular set , or finite composition of such maps . in the present paper",
    ", we work in this class , and denote it by @xmath21 .",
    "dynamic rays in transcendental dynamics are organized according to some symbolic dynamics .",
    "we do not consider this analysis here .",
    "for details about the existence and the uniqueness see @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "we denote a dynamic ray by a continuous parametrized unbounded curve @xmath22 and we call the parameter @xmath23 , the _ potential_. in order to associate the potential to the dynamics , a _ ray model dynamics _ @xmath24 is used , which is a continuous , unbounded and strictly increasing function , and which respects the dynamics , i.e. @xmath25 for some ray @xmath26 and for all @xmath27 .",
    "a dynamic ray @xmath28 is @xmath14-periodic if @xmath29 . in particular , for a @xmath14-periodic dynamic ray @xmath28 @xmath30 is satisfied .",

    "we say that @xmath28 lands if @xmath35 exists .",
    "as for polynomials , understanding the landing behaviors of dynamic rays is essential to understand the topology of the julia set . naturally , the study of landing behaviors of dynamic rays of transcendental maps started with the exponential dynamics .",
    "schleicher and zimmer showed that in the exponential family , every periodic dynamic ray lands if the singular orbit is bounded ( @xcite ) . in @xcite , rempe showed that if the singular orbit of an exponential map does not escape to @xmath8 , all periodic dynamic rays land .    in this article",
    ", we aim to prove a landing theorem for periodic dynamic rays for a general class of transcendental entire maps inside class @xmath21 , where the dynamic rays are well - defined .",
    "in the proof , we use hyperbolic geometry , which is the classical tool to deal with the landing properties of periodic dynamic rays . for a given entire map @xmath2",
    ", we define the _ set of singular values of @xmath2 _ , denoted by @xmath36 , as the union of its _ critical values _ ( @xmath37 where @xmath38 ) , its _ asymptotic values _",

    "* thm b.1 , cor b.4 ) , where the proof also uses hyperbolic geometry ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cor 2.19 ) ) .",
    "our proof mainly differs by our approach to dealing with the following two problems : first , a priori , a ray may turn back to @xmath8 . in @xcite ,",
    "the possibility of having the point at @xmath8 in the accumulation set of a ray when @xmath44 is excluded by using so called `` extendibility '' condition given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* defn 3.1 , observation 3.2 ) ( see ( * ? ? ? * thm b.2 ) ) . in our proof",
    "we rule out this possibility without examining extendibility condition , but with a more direct approach using hyperbolic geometry results .",
    "second , if @xmath2 is not an exponential map , rays may be nonrectifiable .",
    "we treat this situation alternatively , by replacing the hyperbolic length of the fundamental segment with the hyperbolic length of another arc which has some particular properties .    in the proof",
    ", we are going to perform successive pull - backs of fundamental segments on a periodic ray , and we shall see that in the limit , these pullbacks degenerate to a single point . we would like to emphasize that working with maps with bounded post - singular sets has obvious advantages : since the point on the rays escape to infinity under iteration , the postsingular set can not intersect , or accumulate on the set of rays .",
    "this allows us to pull back a fundamental segment all the way along a periodic ray .",
    "furthermore , having a bounded post - singular set provides useful hyperbolic geometry properties to study the dynamics in a neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "the idea of the proof of the main theorem is as follows : suppose @xmath45 is a @xmath14-periodic dynamic ray .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the accumulation set of @xmath28 as @xmath44 .",

    "we show that the limit point @xmath47 is finite , and is a periodic point , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "this holds for any accumulation point in @xmath46 , which means @xmath46 is a discrete set . on the other hand , @xmath46 is connected , being an accumulation set of a connected set .",
    "hence @xmath52 , as we wanted to show .",
    "suppose @xmath53 is the unbounded connected component of @xmath54 , and hence @xmath55 .",
    "we divide the proof into two cases according to whether the accumulation point @xmath47 is in @xmath53 , or in @xmath56 . the possibility of having the point at infinity in the accumulation set is ruled out under the case when @xmath57 .",
