    "the chemical compositions of the compounds were estimated by using an energy dispersive x - ray spectrometer ( edxs ) , from which an actual fe concentration of @xmath27=0.07 and 0.12 were determined for the nominal @xmath27=0.05 and 0.1 , respectively .",

    "no obvious transition can be found in the electrical resistivity around the temperature where a broad maximum demonstrated in the magnetic susceptibility ( see below ) , which is distinct from the analogue compound , ndcoaso , where a step - like fm - afm transition of co moments is clearly seen around 14 k both in the electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility.@xcite however , at @xmath37 t an obvious transition appears around @xmath38 25 k , as indicated by the arrow in fig .",

    "the @xmath16 is suppressed to lower temperatures with increasing the magnetic field , and disappears at @xmath41 t. we note that strong negative magnetoresistance persists down to the temperature we have identified as @xmath16 .",
    "below that temperature , the resistivity returns to the low - temperature limit of the zero - field resistivity .",
    "we propose that the fm co lattice has strong uniaxial anisotropy , with a random orientation of hard @xmath31-axis in the polycrystalline crystals . in zero field , the grain - to - grain magnetic orientation is random , giving rise to spin - scattering at grain boundaries . in an applied field ,",
    "the magnetization of neighboring grains is aligned with the magnetic field so long as the zeeman energy exceeds the anisotropy energy .",
    "the difference between low - field and high - field resistance , then , is attributed to spin - dependent grain - boundary scattering .",
    "as the temperature decreases , two effects change the balance between zeeman and anisotropy energy : ( 1 ) the anisotropy energy increases with decreasing temperature and ( 2 ) the magnetization of gd exerts an afm molecular field on co , reducing the net magnetic field acting on the co magnetization . ignoring this latter effect",
    ", we note that the grain - boundary resistance is completely suppressed at 9 t. using the estimate of 0.32 @xmath42/co , we place an upper limit on the anisotropy energy to be approximately 3 @xmath43 10@xmath44 j / m@xmath45 , similar to other co compounds.@xcite at low temperatures , the gd - afm transition is barely visible in the electrical resistivity ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , however , we can track it in the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat ( see below ) . upon co / fe substitution , the co magnetic transitions decrease to lower temperatures.@xcite for @xmath46 , the @xmath34 curve shows a distinct transition at @xmath38 25 k in a field of 0.5 t , as the arrow shows in fig .",
    "2(b ) . upon increasing the magnetic field , @xmath16 is also quickly suppressed to lower temperatures before disappearing at @xmath47 t. however , the @xmath13 is robust against the magnetic field , and the resistive upturn at @xmath13 is likely associated with a gap opening.@xcite we note that the @xmath13 of @xmath46 is hardly seen in the electrical resistivity at 9 t , but still can be found in the specific heat .",
    "in addition , for @xmath46 , a subsequent transition was observed below @xmath13 for @xmath48 t ( marked as @xmath49 in the inset of fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , which is present in the thermodynamic properties as well ( see below ) .",
    "since this subsequent transition disappears at the field where the @xmath16 is suppressed , it may arise from a magnetic reorientation of co moments .     at various magnetic fields for gdco@xmath6fe@xmath7aso with @xmath8 ( a ) and @xmath9 ( b ) .",

    "3 . as an example",
    ", here we take gdcoaso for a detailed analysis ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . the magnetic susceptibility increases sharply at a temperature that decreases with @xmath27 , indicating fm nature of this transition .",
    "the curie temperature of co moments @xmath11 can be obtained from the derivatives of d@xmath50/d@xmath4 ( see details in ref .",
    "14 ) . at an extremely small field ,",
    "the fm transition is sharp in temperature , but it broadens and slightly shifts to higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field.@xcite similar effects were reported previously in smcoaso and ndcoaso.@xcite at high temperatures ( @xmath51 150 k ) , the magnetic susceptibility follows a curie - weiss law , with the derived effective moment close to the free ion moment of gd ( 7.94@xmath42 ) , indicating the negligible contribution of co moments.@xcite furthermore , the susceptibility can be modeled within the mean field approach by considering the afm coupling between the gd and co sublattice , giving rise to fim behavior in the magnetic susceptibility.@xcite at temperatures just below @xmath11 , a broad maximum was observed at low fields ( @xmath52 t ) that becomes much sharper ( peak ) at large fields ( @xmath53 t ) , as shown in fig . 3 , being consistent with the reorientation transitions observed in @xmath2 curves in fig .",
    "as discussed above , such behavior corresponds to the realignment of co moments away from the field direction due to increasing magnetocrystalline anisotropy at low temperatures .",
    "roughly 1/3 of the magnetic moment should be involved , an estimation that is consistent with the observed decrease in magnetization . for fields above 7 t ( 5 t for @xmath27 = 0.05 ) , the local anisotropy is unable to reorient the co magnetization in hard - axis grains and no sharp decrease can be observed .",
    "however , no distinct anomaly can be found in the electrical resistivity and the specific heat for @xmath52 t , implying that the reorientation process is broad in temperature at low fields . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the gd afm transition ( @xmath13 ) can be clearly found in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath40 , which is nearly unchanged upon co / fe substitution.@xcite with increasing the magnetic field , the feature at @xmath11 is smeared , but @xmath16 is rapidly suppressed to lower temperatures and becomes barely visible at @xmath54 t and 5 t for @xmath27 = 0 and 0.05 , respectively . on the other hand , @xmath13 is robust against the magnetic field , as the up arrows indicated in the insets of figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) . for @xmath27 = 0.05",
    ", the subsequent transition below @xmath13 also appears in the magnetic susceptibility , as indicated by @xmath49 in the inset of fig .",
    "3(b)(down arrows ) .",
    "such a subsequent transition is barely visible at @xmath39 t in the @xmath40 , but it can be tracked up to 4 t in @xmath34 ( see inset of fig .",

    "4 ) . in the pm state ,",
    "the magnetization of both samples is linear in field , e.g. , @xmath58= 100 k and 60 k for @xmath27 = 0 and 0.05 , respectively ; while at temperatures below @xmath11 , the @xmath2 curve changes its slope at a magnetic field that increases with decreasing temperature , indicating a reorientation transition .",
    "the applied magnetic field pulls the magnetization of each grain from the local easy direction to the field direction via a first order reorientation transition , i.e. , all the moments are polarized to the field direction ( see polarized phase in the phase diagram ( see below ) ) .",
    "because the orientations of the grains are random , the transition is spread out and becomes continuous .",
    "the reorientation transition field @xmath17 can be determined from the derivatives of magnetization with respect to magnetic field d@xmath59/d@xmath5 .",
    "the derived @xmath17 , marked by arrows in fig .",
    "4 , are summarized in the @xmath60 phase diagram ( see below ) . for @xmath8 , the derived @xmath17",
    "are consistent with previous results on gdcoaso.@xcite it is noted that , for @xmath4 = 2.5 k , the @xmath17 of @xmath8 is larger than 5 t. @xmath17 also decreases upon co / fe substitution , suggesting that the fe moments are likely oriented opposite to the co moments due to internal fields .",
    "a scenario involving disorder within the coas - layers is also suggested .",
    "the fe atoms acting as impurities in the co sites , might decrease the co - co exchange interaction , making the reorientation transition occur at lower field .    in fig . 5 , we present the temperature dependence of the specific heat for gdco@xmath6fe@xmath7aso measured under various magnetic fields up to 9 t.",
    "the huge magnetic entropy at @xmath13 is attributed to the large spin freedom of gd - ions ( @xmath61 rln(2@xmath62 + 1 ) ) , while the entropy change associated with co magnetic transitions is weak , indicating a low - spin configuration of co - ions .",
    "such behavior agrees with the effective moment derived from the curie - weiss analysis of the high-@xmath4 susceptibility , which is nearly identical to the free - ion moment of gd , with the contribution of co moments being negligible .",
    "further experiments , e.g , electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements , would be useful to confirm the spin configurations of co. in order to demonstrate the co magnetic transitions , low-@xmath4 specific heat @xmath55 is plotted in figs .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) for @xmath27 = 0 and 0.05 , respectively . according to the landau - type theory , the heat capacity would exhibit a jump at the reorientation transition.@xcite for @xmath8 , no obvious anomaly at @xmath16 can be found in the specific heat for @xmath52 t , but the slope of @xmath55 changes at @xmath11 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "however , when further increasing the magnetic field ( @xmath53 t ) , the @xmath55 does exhibit a step - like increase at @xmath16 , as the arrows indicate in fig .",
    ". the reorientation transition temperatures @xmath16 in the specific heat are highly consistent with those derived from the electrical resistivity @xmath34 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath40 data .",
    "the @xmath16 is also monotonically suppressed on increasing the magnetic field in the @xmath55 , which decreases to 5.7 k at @xmath63 t before encountering the gd afm transition ( @xmath64 3.5 k ) .",
    "we note that at @xmath54 t , it is difficult to determine the @xmath16 in the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility due to the proximity to @xmath13 , but it still can be tracked in the electrical resistivity ( see fig .",
    "similar behavior was also observed for @xmath46 except that the @xmath16 is observable already at @xmath65 t ( see inset of fig .",
    "5(b ) ) , reflecting that co / fe substitution decreases the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .    in figs .",
    "5(c ) and ( d ) , we plot the specific heat @xmath66 below 10 k for @xmath27 = 0 and 0.05 to show the magnetic properties of gd moments under various magnetic fields .",
    "a value of 2 j / mol - k@xmath67 is added as an offset . again , for both compounds , the afm order of gd moments is relatively robust against the magnetic field .",
    "similar behavior was also observed in @xmath34 and @xmath40 . on the other hand , for @xmath46 , a subsequent transition below @xmath13",
    "was also found in the specific heat at @xmath68 3 t , denoted as @xmath49 in fig .",
    "5(d ) , being consistent with the @xmath34 and @xmath40 data .",
    "this subsequent transition is likely attributed to a further reorientation of co moments due to the coupling between co @xmath10 and gd @xmath12 electrons.@xcite    -@xmath5 phase diagram for gdco@xmath6fe@xmath7aso , ( a ) @xmath8 and ( b ) @xmath46 .",

    "the application of a magnetic field leads to rich physical properties , which are correspondingly associated with co @xmath10 and gd @xmath12 electrons . at zero field ,",
    "the co moments form a long - range fm order with a curie temperature @xmath69 75 k and @xmath69 50 k for @xmath8 and @xmath46 , respectively . just below @xmath11 and at low field",
    ", the afm coupling between co and gd may be sufficient to polarize the gd moments opposite to the fm co and the applied field , yielding a narrow fim regime .",
    "as usual , the fm transition gradually broadens as the magnetic field increases ( marked by fm@xmath70 ) . at temperatures below @xmath11 ,",
    "when magnetocrystalline anisotropy exceeds the zeeman energy , it aligns the co magnetization with the local easy axes of various grains , causing a spin reorientation transition at @xmath16 ( marked by sr@xmath70 ) . with increasing magnetic field ,",
    "the gap between fm@xmath70 and sr@xmath71 gradually increases before the fm order fades out . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the gd moments are ordered antiferromagnetically with a nel temperature of @xmath72 k ( marked by afm@xmath73 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 is nearly unchanged , while the @xmath16 gradually moves to lower temperature with increasing magnetic field . since the gd moments are still ordered antiferromagnetically at 9 t ( see figs .",
    "5(c ) and ( d ) ) , further study under higher magnetic field is desirable to clarify whether there exists an @xmath20-electron magnetic critical point in these compounds .",
    "it is noted that , for @xmath46 , there is another magnetic transition inside the gd afm phase , denoted as @xmath49 in fig .",
    "such a transition disappears around the field where @xmath16 is suppressed , so we attribute it to the magnetic reorientation of co moments .",
    "furthermore , inside the sr@xmath70 phase , the applied magnetic field can pull the magnetization of co grains from the local easy direction to the field direction ( marked by polarized phase ) .    in gdco@xmath6fe@xmath7aso",
    ", we propose that the co layers exhibit significant magnetocrystalline anisotropy ; each grain will have its own local magnetic orientation and there will be spin - flip scattering among the grains .",
    "the applied magnetic field can pull the magnetization of each grain from the local easy axes to the field direction via a first - order reorientation transition . as we discussed previously , considering the afm coupling between the gd and co sublattice , the effective field on co moments",
    "can be described as @xmath74 within a mean - field approach.@xcite here the @xmath75 is the fm co - co coupling constant and @xmath76 is the afm co - gd coupling . as we discussed in the resistivity section , at a fixed external field , two factors will modify the reorientation process on decreasing the temperature : ( i ) the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy increases and ( ii ) the effective magnetic field , acting on co , decreases due to the increased afm coupling to the gd paramagnetism ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic field is unable to suppress the reorientation transition at lower temperatures , causing the co magnetization to rotate toward the local easy direction in each grain .",
    "consequently , the electrical resistivity approaches the low - field behavior which is dominated by spin - flip scattering at grain boundaries and a step - increase in the specific heat accompanies the reorientation . at low fields ,",
    "the direction of magnetization changes continuously over a temperature interval of several degrees with no observable changes in the magnitude of magnetization , but it becomes much sharper with increasing magnetic field ( see details in fig .",
    "3 ) . as an example , for @xmath8 , the reorientation transition at low fields ( @xmath52 t ) is very broad , the susceptibility exhibits very broad maximum , and no observable transition can be found in the electrical resistivity and specific heat . while for @xmath46 , the critical field decreases to 0.5 t , as expected since the co / fe substitution in the coas - layers weakens the fm co - co coupling constant @xmath75 or increases the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "therefore , both magnetic field and chemical substitutions can effectively tune the magnetic properties of these compounds , providing the examples for fundamental research and application .",
    "in conclusion , we have synthesized gdco@xmath6fe@xmath7aso ( @xmath8 and 0.05 ) polycrystalline samples and systematically investigated the field - tuning effects on the electrical resistivity , magnetization and specific heat .",
    "a rich @xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagram has been constructed .",
    "it is found that the magnetic field can effectively tune the magnetic properties of co @xmath10 electrons , while the gd @xmath12 electrons are insensitive to the applied magnetic field .",
    "further investigations on single crystals are badly needed in order to clarify the role of magnetocrystalline anisotropy . to achieve that , one still needs to overcome the difficulties of growing sizable single crystals .",
    "moreover , it is also interesting to extend the measurements to higher magnetic fields and lower temperatures to study the possible magnetic critical behaviors .",
