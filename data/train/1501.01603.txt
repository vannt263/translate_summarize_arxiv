    "the problem of population extinction in ecological systems has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "population extinction can occur due to a number of reasons such as habitat loss , climate change , pollution , epidemics , etc@xcite .",
    "also , when a species alien to a stable ecological system is introduced it may pose a threat of extinction for a certain number of species@xcite .    in an ecological system",
    "the underlying dynamics could be quite complex due to its large degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "a theoretical model is often helpful in understanding the dynamics of extinction without going into finer details of the real system .",
    "one approach would be to include in the model only the relevant degrees of freedom and incorporate the effect of the rest in parameters that can be determined experimentally .",
    "population model with spatial inhomogeneity have been studied by a number of authors@xcite .",
    "modelling extinction in inhomogeneous system can further our understanding of the dynamics of real systems .",
    "for instance spatial inhomogeneity has a stabilizing effect on the interaction among different species@xcite , it can affect the front speed@xcite and the width@xcite of a propagating invasion .",
    "the simplest example of inhomogeneous reaction - diffusion system is the trapping of diffusing particle by traps@xcite . the density of particles for trapping reaction with randomly distributed traps has been know to show a stretched exponential behavior@xcite , self - segregation@xcite , and self - organization around traps@xcite .",
    "random growth and trapping of diffusing particle can be used to model inhomogeneous population models@xcite . recently trapping reaction models has been used to study population dynamics with localized predation@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study host - pathogen dynamics in a spatially inhomogeneous system .",
    "our motivation come from the recent studies of global amphibian population extinction due to infection by the fungal pathogen _",
    "batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_(bd)@xcite .",
    "detailed investigation of the frog - bd dynamics in lake basins have shown that after the arrival of the pathogen in a basin it spreads in a wave like pattern infecting the entire population .",
    "it is likely that the spread of pathogen occurs via an unknown vector since the inter - lake frog movement has not been found .",
    "complete extinction is observed only when the intensity of infection reached a critical threshold @xcite .",
    "here we study a model of host - pathogen dynamics that explains these observed phenomena qualitatively .",
    "we shall show how the pathogen spreads from one lake to another by a wave like pattern and estimate the linear wave speed .",
    "the extinction time at a lake depends on the steady state population of a lake .",
    "we compute the extinction time analytically and numerically . by numerical computations",
    "we shall investigate the host - pathogen dynamics in a lake basin system to understand global population decline .",
    "further applications and improvements to the model are discussed .",
    "we consider interaction between fungal pathogen ` bd ' and host ` frog ' in an inhomogeneous media .",
    "the inhomogeneous media consists of localized regions in space that are habitats of frogs .",
    "these localized regions for our case models the lake basin systems described in ref.@xcite .",
    "as the interlake movement of frogs has not been observed , we assume that the pathogen interacts with the host only in these localized regions .",
    "the size of lakes are assumed negligible when compared to the mean separation between two nearest lakes .",
    "therefore , we assume the lakes to be point like regions in space , as a result host - pathogen dynamics in the lake basin system reduces to a host - pathogen model in presence of quenched disorder@xcite . this assumption is valid as long as we are interested in the depletion of the total host population in the lake basin .",
    "however , a generalization is possible where one can replace the point objects by extended objects .",
    "such a model would be interesting only when one is interested in intra - lake dynamics with lakes of various shapes and sizes .",
    "let us consider the homogeneous steady states @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the decoupled equations . for the host , the homogeneous steady state @xmath30 is unstable and @xmath31 is stable .",
    "in other words , without the influence of pathogen each lake can be considered as a stable ecosystems . for the pathogen ,",

    "( [ diffeq2 ] ) gives @xmath33 clearly , the steady state @xmath34 is stable if @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that the steady state @xmath36 is stable if @xmath37 .",

    "one would be interested to know how these steady states change when host - pathogen interaction is introduced .",
    "we expect the host population to decline due to the pathogen interaction .",
    "let us assume that a small patch of pathogen have just arrived at a particular lake @xmath3 at time @xmath42 .",

    "we shall estimate the time scale for the total extinction of the host in the lake .",
