    "the quantum - statistical enhancement of the pairs of identical pions produced with close momenta was observed first in @xmath5 collisions in 1959 @xcite .",
    "it took more than a decade to develop the method of pion interferometry based on the discovered phenomenon .",
    "this was done at the beginning of the 1970s by kopylov and podgoretsky @xcite .",
    "their theoretical analysis assumed the radiating source as consisting of independent incoherent emitters .",
    "in fact , such a representation is used for a long time for the analysis of the space - time structure of particle sources created in @xmath5 , @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the concept of independent emitters was applied to a further development of the interferometric method , in particular , to account for momentum - position correlations of the emitted particles @xcite that , in turn , has resulted in a general interpretation of the measured radii as the homogeneity lengths in the wigner functions @xcite .",
    "this concept is important for a study of @xmath4 collision processes within the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "also a detailed analysis of the particle final state ( coulomb ) interactions brings the significant contribution to the traditional method of correlation femtoscopy @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite the correlation analysis is taken beyond the model of independent particle emitters .",
    "it is found that the uncertainty principle leads to ( partial ) indistinguishability of closely located emitters that fundamentally impedes their full independence and incoherence .",
    "the partial coherence of emitted particles is because of the quantum nature of particle emission and happens even if there is no specific mechanism to produce a coherent component of the source radiation .",
    "this effect leads to a reduction of the interferometry radii and suppression of the bose - einstein correlation functions .",
    "the effect is significant only for small sources with typical sizes less than 2 fm .",
    "we shall apply this approach @xcite to the analysis of data in @xmath0 collisions at the lhc energy of @xmath1 tev , where the measured interferometry radii are just within the above scale .",
    "a simple estimate will be done also for @xmath2pb , where the radii are larger and such corrections are less important .",
    "a first attempt of the systematic theoretical analysis of the pion interferometry of @xmath0 collisions at the top rhic and @xmath7 tev lhc energies was made in ref.@xcite within the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) .",
    "it was found that , for a satisfactory description of the interferometry radii , one needs to reduce significantly the formation time by increasing the string tension value relative to the one fixed by the qgsm description of the spectra and multiplicity .",
    "otherwise , the radii obtained within qgsm are too large compared to the measured ones .",
    "the similar result is obtained within urqmd @xcite .",
    "hypothetically one can hope to reduce the predicted radii suggesting the other approach  the hydrodynamic mechanism of the bulk matter production in @xmath0 collisions , at least , for high multiplicity events . then , to reproduce high multiplicity , the initially very small @xmath0 system has to be superdense at early times .",
    "this leads to very large collective velocity gradients , and so the homogeneity lengths should be fairly small .",
    "however , as we shall demonstrate , even at the maximally possible velocity gradients at the given multiplicity , one gets again an overestimate of the interferometry radii in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the similar result is obtained in hydrodynamics in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained using epos 2.05 + hydro , need to be clarified since that version of epos underestimates the transverse energy per unit of rapidity @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the problem of theoretical description of the interferometry radii in @xmath0 collisions may be a general one for different types of event generators associated with various particle production mechanisms .",
    "here we try to correct the results on interferometry from event generators using for this aim the quantum effects accounting for partial indistinguishability and mutual coherence of the closely located emitters due to the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "in this letter we employ the hydrokinetic model ( hkm ) @xcite in its hybrid form @xcite where the urqmd hadronic cascade is considered as the semi - classical event generator at the post freeze - out ( `` afterburner '' ) stage of the hydrodynamic / hydrokinetic evolution .",
    "we analyze two aspects of the analysis of @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the main one is : whether quantum corrections can help to describe the experimental data .",
    "if yes , it gives hope that it can be successfully applied for any event generator associated with another mechanisms of the particle production .",
    "the second aspect is more sophisticated : whether the typical hybrid models developed for @xmath4 collisions ( here hybrid = hydrodynamic / hydrokinetic + hadronic cascade ) with correspondingly modified initial conditions and with the above - mentioned quantum corrections can be real candidates to describe the bulk observables in @xmath0 collisions at lhc energies . for this aim",
    "we study the space - time structure of @xmath0 collisions , namely , analyze the multiplicity dependence of interferometry radii and volume as well as the @xmath8-behavior of the hbt radii .",
    "it is worth noting that a satisfactory description of the corresponding experimental data challenges the theoretical picture of @xmath0 collisions , however supporting the landau pioneer suggestion @xcite to use relativistic hydrodynamic theory for the hadron collisions with high multiplicity .",
    "certain arguments in the favor of this suggestion are presented , for example , in @xcite , where multiparticle production in nuclear collisions is related to that in hadronic ones within the model based on dissipating energy of participants and their types , which includes landau relativistic hydrodynamics and constituent quark picture .",
    "the hydrokinetic model @xcite of @xmath4 collisions consists of several ingredients describing different stages of the evolution of matter in such processes . at the first stage of system s evolution",
    "the matter is supposed to be chemically and thermally equilibrated and its expansion is described within perfect ( 2 + 1)d boost - invariant relativistic hydrodynamics with the lattice qcd - inspired equation of state in the quark - gluon phase @xcite matched with a chemically equilibrated hadron - resonance gas via crossover - type transition .",
    "the hadron - resonance gas consists of 329 well - established hadron states made of u , d , s - quarks , including @xmath9-meson ( @xmath10(600 ) ) .",
    "with such an equilibrated evolution the system reaches the chemical freeze - out isotherm with the temperature @xmath11 165 mev . at the second stage with @xmath12",
    ", the hydrodynamically expanding hadron system gradually looses its ( local ) thermal and chemical equilibrium and particles continuously escape from the system .",
    "this stage is described within the hydrokinetic approach @xcite to the problem of dynamical decoupling . in hhkm model",
    "@xcite the hydrokinetic stage is matching with hadron cascade urqmd one @xcite at the isochronic hypersurface @xmath9 :  @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) , that guarantees the correctness of the matching ( see @xcite for details ) . the analysis provided in ref .",
    "@xcite shows a fairly small difference of the one- and two - particle spectra obtained in hhkm and in the case of the direct matching of hydrodynamics and urqmd cascade at the chemical freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "thus , in this letter we utilize just the latter simplified `` hybrid '' variant for the afterburner stage .",
    "let us try to apply the above hydrokinetic picture to the lhc @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 tev aiming to get the minimal interferometry radii / volume at the given multiplicity bin .",
    "as it is known @xcite the maximal average velocity gradient , and so the minimal homogeneity lengths can be reached for a gaussian - like initial energy density profile .",
    "for the same aim we use the minimal transverse scale in ultra - high energy @xmath0 collision , close to the size of gluon spots @xcite in a proton moving with a speed @xmath15 . in detail",
    ", the initial boost - invariant tube for @xmath0 collisions has a gaussian energy density distribution in the transverse plane @xmath16 with width ( rms ) @xmath17 0.3 fm @xcite and , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we attribute it to an initial proper time @xmath18 0.1 fm / c . at this time",
    "there is no initial transverse collective flow .",
    "the maximal initial energy density is defined by all charged particle multiplicity bin .",
    "the maximum initial energy density , @xmath19 , is determined in hkm , for selected experimental bins in multiplicity , by fitting of the mean charged particle multiplicity in those bins .    the correlation function for bosons in the urqmd event generator",
    "is calculated according to @xmath20 where @xmath21 if @xmath22 and 0 otherwise , with @xmath23 being the bin size in histograms .",
    "the method ( [ cfs ] ) accounts for the smoothness approximation @xcite .",
    "the output urqmd 3d correlation histograms in the lcms for different relative momenta @xmath24 are fitted with gaussians at each @xmath25 bin @xmath26 the interferometry radii @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the suppression parameter @xmath30 are extracted from this fit .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we demonstrate the results from hydrokinetic model for the pion interferometric radii , comparing them with the ones measured by the alice collaboration at the lhc @xcite in @xmath0 collisions at the energy @xmath1  tev .",
    "as one can see there is a significant systematic overestimate of the predicted interferometry volume @xmath31 in @xmath0 collision even at the minimal homogeneity lengths possible for the given multiplicity classes .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the first paper devoted to the same topic `` pion interferometry testing the validity of hydrodynamical models '' @xcite . in",
    "what follows we shall try to improve the results of the semi - classical hkm event generator by means of the quantum corrections to them @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that , for small systems formed in particle collisions ( e.g.  @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) where the observed interferometry radii are about 12  fm or smaller , the uncertainty principle does nt allow one to distinguish completely between individual emission points .",
    "also the phases of closely emitted wave packets are mutually coherent . all that is taken into account in the formalism of partially coherent phases in the amplitudes of closely spaced individual emitters .",
    "the measure of distinguishability and partial coherence is then the overlap integral of the two emitted wave packets . in thermal systems",
    "the role of the corresponding coherence length is played by the thermal de broglie wavelength that defines also the size of a single emitter .",
    "the monte - carlo method ( [ cfs ] ) can not account for such effects since it deals with classical particles and point - like emitters ( points of the particle s last collision ) .",
    "the classical probabilities are summarized according to the event generator method ( [ cfs ] ) , while in the quantum approach a superposition of partially coherent amplitudes , associated with different possible emission points , serves as the input for further calculations @xcite .",
    "such an approach leads to a reduction of the interferometry radii as compared to eq .",
    "( [ cfs ] ) .",
    "in addition , the ascription of the factor @xmath34 to the weight of the pion pair in ( [ cfs ] ) is not correct for very closely located points @xmath35 and @xmath36 because there is no bose - einstein enhancement if the two identical bosons are emitted from the same point @xcite .",
    "the effect is small for large systems with large number of independent emitters . for small systems , however , it can be significant and one has to exclude unphysical contributions ( `` double counting '' @xcite ) in the two - particle emission amplitude .",
    "such corrections lead to a suppression of the bose - einstein correlations that is manifested in a reduction of the observed correlation function intercept compared with one in the standard method ( [ cfs ] ) .",

    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are presented in the non - relativistic approximation related to the rest frame of the source moving with four - velocity @xmath37 . in the hydrodynamic / hydrokinetic approach",
    "the role of such a source at a given pair s half - momentum bin near some value @xmath38 is played by the fluid element or piece of the matter with the size equal to the homogeneity length @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "these lengths are extracted from the hkm simulations , namely , from the interferometry radii defined by the gaussian fits to the correlation functions obtained in hkm .",
    "all the pairs in procedure ( 1 ) are considered in the longitudinally co - moving system ( lcms ) that in the boost - invariant approximation automatically selects the longitudinal rest frame of the source and longitudinal homogeneity length in this frame ( it is lorentz - dilated as compared to one in the global system @xcite ) .",
    "the femtoscopy analysis is typically related to a fixed @xmath8 bin and so one needs also to determine the transverse source size in the transverse rest frame .",
    "the corresponding lorentz transformations do not change the _ side_-homogeneity length ; as for the _ out_-direction we proceed in the way proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "therefore , only @xmath52 and correspondingly @xmath53 , including @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are really transformed in ( [ fit ] ) at the lorentz boosts along the transverse momentum of the pair .",
    "the correlation function @xmath56 is the lorentz invariant , therefore @xmath57 inv .",
    "to relate the interferometry radius in the rest frame of the source ( marked by the asterisk ) to the one in _",
    "basic_-rs one should express both values through the radius in _ tilde_-rs using the invariance property similar as it is done in @xcite",
    ". then one can get @xmath58 here @xmath59 is a rapidity of the source in transverse direction , @xmath60 is half - sum of transverse rapidities of the particles forming the pair",
    ". then one can represent the correlation function again in the form ( [ fit ] ) where all the variables are related already to the rest frame of the source and the hbt radii in this rest frame are expressed through the radii in _",

    "is considered as a product of the single - particle amplitudes , thus suggesting the maximal possible distinguishability and independence of different emitters compatible with the uncertainty principle for momentum & position and energy - momentum & time measurements .",

    "then we put these extracted values into the expression ( [ corf ] ) for the correlation function and perform its fitting with the gaussian ( [ fit ] ) .",
    "this gives us finally the interferometry radii @xmath53 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 in view of the uncertainty principle .",
    "the radii are presented then in the _ basic_-rs using the transformations inverse to  ( [ r , t ] ) .",
    "the correlation function is the ratio of the two- and one - particle spectra .",
    "it is found  @xcite that quantum corrections to this ratio are not so sensitive to different forms of the wave packets as the spectra itself . in particular , the effective temperature of the _ corrected _ transverse spectra depends on whether the parameter of mean particle momentum is included or not into the wave packet formalism .",
    "if yes , the corrected effective temperature for small sources @xmath99 fm is equal or even higher than that of individual emitters , @xmath116 , while for the wave packets in the form ( [ psi2 ] ) it is lower @xcite . besides of this , in the non - relativistic approximation one can describe only very soft part of the spectra .",
    "that is why we focus in the letter on the corrections to the bose - einstein correlation functions where in the rest frame of the source the total and relative momenta of the boson pairs are fairly small .",

    "the hkm event generator provides us with the interferometry radii in _ basic_-rs . to find the corresponding homogeneity lengths in the rest frame of the source according to ( [ r , t ] ) we use , as discussed in section 3 , the two limiting cases : the transverse boost to the rest frame of the pair from the basic lcms system , or no transformation at all . for the former case it is defined by the @xmath8 bin and for @xmath118 gev @xmath119 .",

    "[ fig3a ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] for the two multiplicity classes @xmath167 and @xmath168 we present the three curves for interferometry radii as a function of @xmath8 : the experimental one , the one taken just from the hkm simulations and the other one obtained after application of the quantum corrections .",
    "the basic parameters used correspond to the case @xmath124 ( see above ) .",
    "the @xmath123  parameter values linearly increase with @xmath8 from 1.15 to 1.35 for the @xmath167 case and from 1.02 to 1.10 for @xmath169 in such a way that for @xmath8 bin ( 0.2,0.3 ) it has the same values as in previous @xmath170 calculations .",
    "as one can see , similarly to the multiplicity behavior , the quantum corrected @xmath8-dependency of the radii also gets closer to the experimental values , but for large @xmath8 the corrections are insufficient to fully describe the observable femtoscopy scales behavior .",
    "this fact may indicate that sources of particles with large @xmath8 can not be described in hydrodynamical approximation .",

    "one can conclude that quantum corrections to pion interferometry radii in @xmath0 collisions at the lhc can significantly improve the ( semi - classical ) event generator results that typically give an overestimate of the experimental interferometry radii and volumes .",
    "the corrections account for the basic ( partial ) indistinguishability and mutual coherence of closely located emitters because of the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the additional suppression of the bose - einstein correlation function also appears .",
    "the effects become important for small sources , 12 fm or smaller .",
    "such systems can not be completely random and so require a modification of the standard theoretical approach for correlation analysis . the predicted interferometric radii for @xmath2pb collisions",
    "need some small corrections only for its minimal values corresponding to the _ initial _ transverse size of @xmath38pb system 0.9 fm .",
    "more sophisticated result of this study is a good applicability of the hydrodynamics / hydrokinetics with the quantum corrections for description of hbt radii not only in @xmath4 collisions but also , at least for large multiplicities , in @xmath0 events .",
    "these radii are well reproduced for not too large @xmath8 . whether it means the validity of the hydrodynamic mechanism for the bulk matter production in the lhc @xmath0 collisions is still an open question .",
    "it is also related to the problem of early thermalization in the processes of heavy ion collisions ; the nature of this phenomenon is still a fundamental theoretical issue .",
