    "4u  0142 + 61  was discovered in 1978 with _ uhuru _",
    "@xcite , but only in 1984 were 8.7-s pulsations detected in its persistent x - ray flux with _ exosat _ @xcite .",
    "pulse frequencies were sparsely measured until the last few years .",
    "the frequency values are consistent with a constant spin - down rate of @xmath10 hz s@xmath11 , slightly larger than the @xmath12 hz s@xmath11 recently measured with _ rxte _",
    "phase connected data @xcite . despite detailed searches @xcite , no evidence for orbital doppler shifts has been found in the pulse frequency measurements .",
    "upper limits of @xmath13 lt - s for orbital periods in the range 70 s to 2.5 days @xcite place stringent limits on allowed orbital inclinations and companion masses for normal or helium main sequence companions .",
    "_ asca _ observations in 1994 @xcite and in 1998 @xcite , both determined the source energy spectrum as an absorbed power law ( photon index @xmath14 ) with a blackbody ( @xmath15 kev ) component .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "gis data also revealed very stable ( in time ) pulse profiles and intensities .",
    "the pulse profiles , however , evolved with energy from double - peaked ( 0.5 - 4.0 kev ) , to single peaked ( 4.0 - 8.0 kev ) @xcite . later spectral observations with _ bepposax _ in 1997 - 1998",
    "@xcite were consistent with the _ asca _ spectral results , however it did not show significant pulse phase dependence . using rxte observations , @xcite reported pulse profile evolution with energy , evolving from double - peaked ( 2.0@xmath164.0 kev ) to single peaked ( 6.0@xmath168.0 kev ) .",
    "@xcite used the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetg ) on the cxo to observe the source in 2001 .",
    "they find no evidence for emission or absorption lines in the spectrum which is well fitted by an absorbed powerlaw@xmath17blackbody with @xmath18 and @xmath19 kev .",
    "their analysis used only phase averaged spectra and provided stringent constraints on spectral features .",
    "recent optical observations @xcite have revealed an object with peculiar optical colors inside the _ einstein _ error circle @xcite .",
    "the optical observations imply an extinction of @xmath20 and a distance of @xmath21 kpc .",
    "the object is too faint to be a large accretion disk .",
    "further observations of the optical counterpart revealed pulsations with a 30% pulse fraction @xcite .",
    "the large pulse fraction also rules out x - ray reprocessing ( in a disk ) as the source of the optical pulsations .",
    "a deep radio search showed no evidence for a snr , extended structure , or even a point source at the position of 4u  0142 + 61  @xcite .",
    "we present here an analysis and discussion of our _ chandra _  observation of the source . in ",
    "[ sec : obsresults ] we describe the x - ray observations , and present spatial , timing and spectral results of 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "we also include spatially resolved spectroscopy of the extended emission around 4u  0142 + 61 , presumably due to dust scattering . a precise x - ray position is derived and compared with the optical identification from @xcite .",
    "we observed 4u  0142 + 61  on 21 may 2000 with the _ chandra _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "data were collected sequentially in two different observing modes : timed exposure ( te ) mode and continuous clocking ( cc ) mode .",
    "data obtained in te mode allow for two - dimensional imaging but not for accurate time averaged or pulse - phased spectroscopy due to pulse pile up and the low ( 3.24  s ) time resolution of this data type . in cc mode",
    "the amount of pile up is negligible and one can exploit the 2.85  ms time resolution though the image is one - dimensional .",
    "the source was positioned on the nominal target position of acis - s3 , a back illuminated ccd on the spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) with good charge transfer efficiency and spectral resolution .",
    "standard processing of the data was performed by the _ chandra _  x - ray center to level 1 ( cxc processing software version r4cu5upd13.3 ) .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "calabration database ( caldb2.9 ) was utilized and the data were further processed using the ciao ( v2.2.1 ) tool _ acis_process_events_. the data were filtered to exclude events with _",
    "grades 1 , 5 , and 7 , hot pixels , bad columns , and events on ccd node boundaries .",
    "the s3 light curve was inspected in a region offset from the axp to identify times of high background rate .",
    "we binned the data in 200  s intervals and found no times when the background exceeded a @xmath22 threshold about the mean , and so all the data were deemed useful .",
    "the resulting observing times are 7744  s and 5945  s for te and cc mode data , respectively .",
    "uncertainties are reported at the @xmath23 confidence level .",
    "high resolution timing with acis is only possible using cc - mode data . the cc mode event times denote when the event was read out of the frame store , not when it was detected .",
    "we corrected for this effect by assuming that all photons were originally detected at the nominal target position .",
    "we removed the variable time delay due to spacecraft dither and telescope flexure .",
    "the event arrival times were then corrected to the solar system barycenter using the jpl planetary ephemeris de-200 .",
    "the data were divided into ten intervals , each of @xmath24  s , and individual pulse profiles were created using a coarse ephemeris derived from an epoch fold search .",
    "these ten profiles were compared to the pulse profile derived using all the data and the relative phases were fit with a linear function .",
    "the resulting pulse period of @xmath25  s is referred to epoch mjd 551685.78 .",
    "this period is consistent with the more precise spin history of the source determined with long term rxte monitoring @xcite .",
    "hereafter we use the entire dataset for our timing analysis . the pulse profile ( 0.5@xmath167.0 kev )",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : foldevents]a ; the peak - to - peak pulse fraction ( @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 . here ,",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the maximum and minimum count rates .",
    "we present in figure  [ fig : pulsefraction ] the variation in both the @xmath30 and peak - to - peak pulse fraction of the profile with energy .",
    "we find no significant variation of these values in three energy channels ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 kev ) .",
    "however , we see evidence for evolution in the profile shape with energy ( see  2.4 for quantitative details ) with the first pulse being the softest .",
    "we use only data collected in te mode to derive the axp position . for 4u  0142 + 61 ,",
    "which is rather bright ( @xmath34 acis counts / s between @xmath5 kev ) , the data suffer from pile - up of photons in the image core , as a result of which the source image looks ring - shaped with a hole in the center .",
    "we modeled the data using a gaussian multiplied by a hyperbolic tangent in radius , scaled to approach zero at @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the resulting best - fit centroids correspond , using the _ chandra _  aspect solution , to a j2000 position on the sky of @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the uncertainty is limited by systematic effects , to a circle with @xmath38 radius @xcite .",
    "this position is consistent with the location of the optical counterpart found by @xcite , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , only one other ( faint ) x - ray source is visible in the te observation .",
    "we were , therefore , unable to reduce the 4u  0142 + 61  positional error by using astrometry to obtain a boresight correction .",
    "while searching for extended emission ( within a few arcseconds ) one must account for numerous contributions to the observed flux .",
    "these contributions include not only the bright source itself and the instrumental background , but diffuse emission from the galactic plane , a dust scattering halo , and the potential contribution of an x - ray nebula .",
    "to avoid issues related to the effects of pile up in the te mode data , we first utilized the one dimensional image from the cc mode .",
    "we generated a time - integrated image ( @xmath5 kev ) minus any point sources other than 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "we then subtracted an average count rate intended to remove instrumental and diffuse cosmic x - ray background ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "next , we constructed what will be referred to as the `` pulsed '' image .",
    "we took the observed pulse profile , normalized it to a mean of zero and convolved it with the event list of s3 .",
    "each count recorded on s3 was assigned a phase .",
    "events with a phase near pulse maximum , regardless of their position on the chip , received a positive weight and likewise , those near pulse minimum , a negative weight . in doing so , we remove all emission components in our image that do not vary in phase ( i.e. , everything except the central pulsar ) .",
    "note that the time delay for photons scattered by the interstellar dust is on average minutes , much longer than the pulsar period , and therefore will not contaminate the pulsed image .    to improve statistics , we then folded the 1-d time - integrated ( cc@xmath41 ) and pulsed ( cc@xmath42 ) images about the common centroid and accumulated `` quasi - radial '' profiles .",
    "these profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : radprof ] .",
    "we compare the pulsed radial profile with the marx ( * ? ? ? *",
    "v3.01 ) derived point spread function ( psf ) and calculate @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude that the pulsed radial profile is consistent with the marx psf .",
    "next , we collapsed the te mode observation to mimic the 1-d cc image ( figure  [ fig : radprof ] , te ) .",
    "we find that the te profile completely overlaps the cc@xmath41 profile beyond @xmath44 , marking the radius beyond which the effects of pile - up are negligible .",
    "we conclude that the majority of the 4u  0142 + 61",
    "x - ray flux is contained within a radius of @xmath44 .    in both profiles",
    "we find excess emission beyond @xmath44 which is likely due to a dust - scattering halo and potentially an x - ray plerion .",
    "azimuthally averaged radial profiles generated in different energy bands and spectra extracted from s3 in 3 concentric annuli centered on the pulsar position supports the dust scattering halo hypothesis .",
    "detailed modelling of the spatial and spectral distribution of the dust scattered emission from a sample of x - ray bright sources , including 4u  0142 + 61 , is underway and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we use cc mode data to obtain an x - ray spectrum as these are not impacted by pile up . as no response calibration",
    "is currently available for _ chandra _  cc mode data , here we assume that the cc and te spectral responses are identical . to test this assumption , we compared spectra extracted from both cc and te mode data .",
    "the extraction regions were selected from identical parts of the sky , more than @xmath45 from 4u  0142 + 61 , and close enough to the axp to contain flux from the dust scattering halo .",
    "background spectra were extracted from a region on s3 offset from this source region .",
    "all spectra and response files for our analysis were generated using the ciao ( v2.2.1 ) tools _ dmextract _ , _ mkrmf _ , and _ mkarf _ , and caldb(v2.9 ) .",
    "the extraction was performed in pulse invariant ( pi ) space ( _ i.e. _ , after the instrument gains were applied ) .",
    "we fit both cc and te mode spectra with a te mode response and an absorbed power law model ; we found acceptable fits and reasonable agreement in the derived model parameters ( cc : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and te : @xmath46 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "as a seperate check , we subtract the cc mode spectra from the te mode data and fit the difference to a constant .",
    "this fit resulted in a @xmath51 and was consistent with zero .",
    "based on these tests , we find it valid to adopt the te mode response in our spectral analysis of the cc mode data .",
    "we define the axp source region by selecting an interval @xmath52 pixels ( @xmath53 ) ( see also  [ sec : extended ] ) around the peak flux along the collapsed cc mode axis .",
    "the background was determined using two adjacent segments 16 pixels wide for a total area 2 times the source area ; the background flux contributes @xmath54 of the total ( 0.5 - 7.0 kev ) flux in the source region .",
    "the phase averaged spectrum of the source is shown in figure  [ fig : avespec ] .",
    "we have fit several models to the spectrum and we find that the best fit model is an absorbed power law + blackbody function , which gives @xmath55 , @xmath56 , with a hydrogen column density , @xmath57 .",
    "these parameter values are consistent with the values derived from simultaneous fits to phase resolved spectra ( this is discussed in more detail later in this section ) .",
    "all spectral fits were limited to the @xmath5  kev band with xspecv11.01 @xcite , and use the photo - electric absorption coefficients of @xcite , and abundances of @xcite .    our results for @xmath3  and @xmath6 are consistent with the phase averaged results of @xcite derived from _",
    "chandra _  hetg data .",
    "however , the blackbody temperature derived here differs slightly ( @xmath58 ) and is higher than the one derived from the hetg data .",
    "we do not view this difference as compelling since there are systematic effects that have been treated differently in the two analyses .",
    "the blackbody temperature derived here is also higher than the one derived using _ asca _",
    "data @xcite ; the difference is likely due to contamination from the scattering halo within the large ( 3@xmath59 hpd ) point spread function of the _ asca _  telescopes .",
    "we search for evolution of the spectrum with pulse phase by systematically looking for significant variations in fitted spectral parameters as a function of pulse phase . using the derived pulse period (  [ sec : axptim ] )",
    "we construct a source spectrum for each of ten pulse phase bins .",
    "each of the 10 resulting spectra were grouped into bins that contained at least 25 events .",
    "we constrain the @xmath3  to be identical at each phase ( hereafter defined as `` linked '' ) , since we do not expect large variations in the absorption over the small angular size of the source or any significant intrinsic absorption .    to confirm this assumption we perform and compare similar joint fits with ( a ) @xmath3  free to aquire a best fit value in all phase bins and ( b ) @xmath3  linked at each phase .",
    "all other model parameters are free to obtain their best fit values in each phase bin .",
    "we then fit the data from each of the ten pulse phase bins with an absorbed pl+bb model .",
    "the former method provides similar values of @xmath3  for all bins and consistent with the linked value of @xmath60 derived with the latter method .",
    "furthermore , the former fit results in a @xmath61 for 9 additional parameters ; an @xmath62statistic probability of @xmath63 is calculated , indicating that allowing @xmath3  to be free does not statistically improve the fit .",
    "keeping @xmath3  linked thereafter , we initially we fit the data with the power law normalization ( @xmath64 ) , index ( @xmath6 ) , blackbody normalization ( @xmath65 ) , and @xmath1  free ( table [ tab:1 ] , model 5 ) ; we found a @xmath66 .",
    "the fit is significantly improved ( @xmath67 ) by ignoring the @xmath68 kev band , which contains the iridium - edge structure in the telescope response ( 2.04 kev ) and the si k fluorescence line ( 1.74 kev ) and si absorption edge ( 1.84 kev ) .",
    "( current gain calibration is known to cause spurious features in high s / n spectra in this energy range ) .",
    "one approach to dealing with this situation is to eliminate data from the analysis .",
    "however , to avoid eliminating data , we have opted for an alternative method of analysis .",
    "we included all events with energy between 0.5 - 7.0 kev and accounted for systematic errors by using the calculated reduced @xmath69 ( @xmath70 to determine our 1-@xmath71 error bound . if @xmath72 then the range of parameter space that encompasses a @xmath73 is adopted as the 1-@xmath71 uncertainty ; if @xmath74 then the range of parameter space that encompasses a @xmath75 is adopted as the 1-@xmath71 uncertainty .",
    "the above is the least restrictive constraint to the data and shows evidence for evolution with phase in @xmath1 , but not in @xmath6 . to investigate the evolution of spectral parameters ,",
    "we perform a series of more constraining fits to the data .",
    "we begin with an extremely restrictive fit where @xmath1  and @xmath6 are linked and the ratio of their normalizations is constant .",
    "the results of this fit are shown in table [ tab:1 ] as model 1 .",
    "we next assume ( table [ tab:1 ] , model 2 ) that the spectral shape is unchanged , but the contribution of each component varies .",
    "consequently , we fit all phase bins with @xmath6 and @xmath1  linked , and allow the normalizations to vary .",
    "this fit results in a lower @xmath69 as compared to model 1 , ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) which only improves the fit at the @xmath78 confidence level .",
    "hence , for the remaining fits we constrain the ratio of the normalizations to be linked .",
    "next , we keep @xmath6 linked and allow @xmath1  and the normalizations to vary ( table [ tab:1 ] , model 3 ) .",
    "the decrease in @xmath69 here is significant ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) indicating that allowing @xmath1  to vary statistically improves the fit .",
    "the evolution of blackbody temperature is shown as a function of pulse phase in figure  [ fig : foldevents]b .",
    "the spread in @xmath1  values is @xmath81 kev .",
    "the fits were repeated with @xmath1  linked and with varying @xmath6 and the normalizations ( table [ tab:1 ] , model 4 ) .",
    "the fit results in a @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) which indicate that allowing @xmath6 to vary , also statistically improves the fit .",
    "the evolution of the power law index is shown as a function of pulse phase in figure  [ fig : foldevents]c .",
    "the range of @xmath6 variations here is 0.24 .",
    "models 3 and 4 indicate that there is evidence for evolution in phase in either @xmath6 , or @xmath1 or some combination thereof , as indicated by table [ tab:1 ] , model 5 .",
    "the average 2@xmath1610 kev unabsorbed flux and x - ray luminosity , calculated using model 5 , are @xmath84  ergs  s@xmath11  @xmath85 and @xmath86  ergs  s@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the pl component contributes @xmath87 to the 2@xmath1610 kev unabsorbed flux .",
    "finally , we have searched for spectral lines , but find no significant candidates .",
    "features that appear below @xmath88  kev and in the ir edge , are potentially due to uncertainty in the spectral response .",
    "to set upper limits , we examined two small deviations at 1.0 and 4.9  kev .",
    "the addition of a line , modeled by a gaussian with an intrinsic width of 40 ev at 4.9 kev to the pl+bb model ( table [ tab:1 ] , model 5 ) , results in a @xmath89 for 3 additional parameters ; an @xmath62statistic probability of @xmath90 is calculated , the @xmath91 confidence upper limit on the line flux is @xmath92  ergs  @xmath85  s@xmath11 .",
    "similarly , including a `` line '' at 1.0 kev results in a @xmath93 and and @xmath62statistic probability of @xmath94 .",
    "our results are consistent with the results of @xcite derived from _ chandra _  hetg data .",
    "we have observed the anomalous x - ray pulsar , 4u  0142 + 61  with _ chandra _  and performed detailed phase resolved spectroscopy of the source .",
    "we find that there is significant spectral evolution during the overall pulse .",
    "the phase averaged spectrum can be best fit with a two component model ( pl+bb ) , consistent with earlier results ( @xcite ) .",
    "we confirm the source location of @xcite , which also coincides with the optical counterpart of @xcite .",
    "we measure a pulse period consistent with the measurements of @xcite and confirm limits to the amplitude of possible binary motion in a subset of period ranges previously investigated by @xcite .    the superb _ chandra _  spatial resolution allows us to determine that there is emission extending up to @xmath9 from the pulsar , likely due to dust scattering .",
    "we are unable to determine evidence for excess emission within a few arcseconds of the source ( i.e. , evidence for a plerion ) , due to contamination from the x - ray bright axp and the associated dust scattering halo .",
    "we thank h. marshall for allowing us to compare our results with their observations prior to their publication , and for many insightful comments .",
