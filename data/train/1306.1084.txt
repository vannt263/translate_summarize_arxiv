    "for the astrophysically common process of mass accretion through a disk to be effective , outward angular momentum transport must occur @xcite . in the past two decades",

    "[ fig : eta_num ] and table  [ tab : eta_num ] , there is the consistent trend that as the resolution is increased ( and the cell aspect ratio is kept fixed ) the value of @xmath94 decreases .",
    "for example , between models gbl - lr and gbl - sr the resolution has been increased by a factor of 1.5 resulting in a decrease in @xmath94 by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "based on the results for these three simulations we find @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the number of cells in the radial direction , leading to an estimated resolution requirement of @xmath106cells to achieve a magnetic reynolds number , @xmath107 .",

    "somewhat surprisingly , model gbl - lr - la displays a lower value for @xmath94 , and thus higher @xmath101 , than gbl - lr despite the former having a larger cell aspect ratio . considering",
    "the lower level of turbulent activity in model gbl - lr - la compared to gbl - lr ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] and [ fig : curlb2 ] ) , this shows that numerical resistivity scales with the turbulent motion of the magnetic field , i.e. a larger value of @xmath108 causes a larger net truncation error . in model",

    "it is clear that the development , or initial presence , of large - scale magnetic field components is a vital ingredient in enabling convergence with increasing simulation resolution - see the discussion in the second paragraph of   [ sec : control_volume ] . when present , large - scale magnetic fields can replenish low wavenumber magnetic energy",
    "this is a pre - requisite for convergence since otherwise the reservoir of magnetic energy on the largest scales is drained by the turbulent cascading of magnetic energy to smaller scales .",
    "we show in this section that the simulation boundary conditions dictate whether large scale mean fields can grow and thereby promote convergence . in doing so",
    ", we consider three different classes of simulation : ( 1 ) unstratified shearing boxes ; ( 2 ) stratified shearing boxes ; ( 3 ) global , stratified disks and ( 4 ) global , unstratified disks . in the simplest case - the unstratified shearing - box with periodic boundary conditions - mean radial and vertical fields can not readily evolve . when stratification is introduced the associated interface between the disk body and corona , relaxes the constraint on mean radial field growth such that an @xmath110 dynamo can operate effectively . in global models , mean fields grow relatively quickly , enabling large - scale dynamo activity and magnetic energy replenishment .",
    "a key result of this analysis is that lower simulation resolution is required in stratified global models compared to shearing - boxes because the large - scale radial gradients enabled by open radial boundaries permit a larger magnitude contribution to the creation of magnetic energy from the lorentz force terms .",
    "thus , convergence is attained at lower resolutions in global models than in shearing - boxes .",
    "irrespective of the specific setup ( unstratified / stratified shearing box , global simulation ) numerical simulations of magnetorotational turbulence exhibit common features . during the early phases of simulation evolution , the mri develops and the subsequent magnetic field amplification causes a sharp rise in the magnetic energy , @xmath111 .",
    "magnetic energy built - up during the initial transient growth phase supports optimal mri growth and turbulent driving , which in - turn dissipates magnetic energy via the resistivity and the current density , @xmath112_{\\rm    i}$ ] .",
    "magnetic energy subsides , and a state is approached where magnetic field production and turbulent dissipation come into balance .",
    "this latter stage is the qss",

    "[ sec : control_volume ] , we write the steady - state magnetic energy evolution equation as ( see eq  ( [ eqn : mag_energy3 ] ) : @xmath113 where the separate lorentz and magnetic stress terms for rotational and turbulent contributions are combined in the following terms : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the total ( rotational plus turbulent ) velocity , @xmath116 is the maxwell stress tensor and @xmath117 the lorentz force . from ",
    "[ subsec : mag_energy ] we have @xmath118 , so that eq  ( [ eqn : mag_bal ] ) for the magnetic energy balance now reads : @xmath119 eq  ( [ eqn : balance ] ) states that the achievement of a qss requires the rate of work done on the surfaces of the control volume by maxwell stresses , and by lorentz forces within the volume , to be balanced by dissipation .",
    "magnetic field saturation and the quasi - steady state are solutions to eq  ( [ eqn : balance ] ) .      in our analysis",
    "below , the interplay between the induction equation and the boundary conditions also plays an important role .",
    "we begin with the induction equation , @xmath120 where a numerical resistive term is included for consistency with the magnetic energy balance eq  ( [ eqn : balance ] ) . integrating eq  ( [ eqn : induction3 ] ) over a control volume , @xmath121 , with bounding surface @xmath122",

    "the surface @xmath122 bounding the control volume as well as the boundary conditions on @xmath122 take several different forms depending upon the simulation - stratified / unstratified shearing box , stratified / unstratified global disk .",
    "however , in general we can use the coordinate convention introduced for shearing boxes @xcite , adapting the mathematical analysis in each of the different cases .",
    "therefore , the coordinates @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 correspond to the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions in the control volume , respectively .",
    "the surface integral then involves three separate integrals over the @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 faces , which we denote by @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively . in our representation of the integrated induction equation",
    "we introduce the resistive flux , @xmath131 this represents a diffusion of magnetic field , resulting from resistive effects through the bounding surface @xmath122 .",
    "the integrated induction equation becomes for each coordinate : @xmath132 the surface integrals in eqs  ( [ induction_x ] ) - ( [ induction_z ] ) show the influence of the velocity and magnetic field values at the boundaries on the volume integrated field within the control volume .      in the following sections we utilise our description of the magnetic energy balance combined with inferences from the induction equation to describe how the convergence properties of simulations with different numerical setups can be readily understood in terms of the respective boundary conditions and net magnetic field configuration .      in this case",
    "the model is a periodic box with background shear applied via source terms in the momentum equation .",
    "the shearing - box method is used to represent a small patch of an accretion disk in a cartesian coordinate system such that @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 correspond to the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions , respectively ; the corresponding lengths of each side of the box are @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further details ) .",
    "the boundaries of the control volume in this setup are the boundaries of the computational domain .",
    "for an unstratified shearing - box , the following shearing - periodic boundary conditions are applied in the radial ( @xmath125 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath126 ) and vertical ( @xmath127 ) directions for all dynamical variables @xmath136 except the azimuthal velocity .",
    "let @xmath137 be the shear parameter ( = 3/2 for a keplerian disk ) , then the @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140boundary conditions are : @xmath141 the exception is the azimuthal velocity , which satisfies the above @xmath126- and @xmath127- boundary conditions but whose @xmath125-boundary condition is : @xmath142 applying these boundary conditions to eq  ( [ eqn : balance ] ) , and noting that @xmath143 , we have , @xmath144 where , as noted , @xmath145 refers to the inner radial boundary and @xmath146 is the corresponding element of surface area .",
    "furthermore , noting that structures are typically elongated in the @xmath126-direction , then @xmath147 or @xmath148 , and retaining the largest terms ( those linear in @xmath149 or @xmath150 ) , one finds , @xmath151 the crucial feature of eq  ( [ eqn : sb2 ] ) is that magnetic energy is produced by a combination of the @xmath152 component of the maxwell stress at the radial boundary and lorentz forces doing work within the volume ; the lorentz forces depend on the radial and vertical field components as well as the radial and vertical gradient in @xmath150 .",
    "however , the contributions from the second and third terms on the lhs of eq  ( [ eqn : sb2 ] ) are negligible on large scales if there is zero - net radial and vertical magnetic field , and/or no radial or vertical gradient in @xmath150 .",
    "we now consider the implications of the induction equation for the large scale radial and vertical magnetic fields . inserting the shearing - periodic boundary conditions ( [ spbc_x ] )  ( [ spbc_vy ] ) into the integrated induction eqs  ( [ induction_x ] )  ( [ induction_z ] )",
    ", we obtain : @xmath153 eq  ( [ by_vol ] ) for the azimuthal field shows that it evolves as a result of resistive diffusion but also , and more importantly as a result of the combined action of velocity shear and the radial field .",
    "however , eq  ( [ bx_vol ] ) for the integrated radial field and eq  ( [ bz_vol ] ) for the vertical field show that these components evolve solely under the action of resistive diffusion and there is no influence from the boundary values of the velocity combined with existing field components . if the net fluxes associated with @xmath154 or @xmath155 are initially zero and start to build up within the volume then the diffusion terms will act to dissipate these fluxes and they will remain at near zero levels . hence , initially zero net radial and vertical fields do not develop significant components on the largest scale in the box . on the other hand a net flux vertical field prevails on the timescale of the simulation , and",
    "will maintain a component on the largest realizable scale in the simulation domain .",
    "this is notwithstanding the effect of diffusion since maintaining a non - zero boundary value of @xmath155 minimises diffusion of @xmath155 out of the volume as a result of the gradient in @xmath155 being close to zero .",
    "since magnetorotational turbulence extracts energy from the largest scales and drives it towards the smallest scales @xcite , the preservation of a net vertical field fixes the injection of magnetic energy at the scale of the box , thus replenishing the low wavenumber end of the magnetic energy power spectrum .",
    "in contrast , in a zero - net flux , unstratified shearing - box , the finite reservoir of magnetic energy at the low wavenumber end of the scale is depleted by turbulent driving .",
    "achieving convergence is , therefore , related to the presence of magnetic energy injection by lorentz forces on the largest realisable scales and correspondingly the existence of large scale vertical and/or radial field on those scales .",
    "our analysis explains the results in @xcite who compared zero - net flux and net flux simulations .",
    "they demonstrated that energy injection - represented by the fourier space analogue of our shear term , @xmath156 - continues to rise as one tends towards the largest scales in the box in the case of net flux simulations , whereas it plateaus for the zero net flux simulations .",
    "this indicates that in evolved zero - net flux turbulence ( in an unstratified shearing - box ) , magnetic energy is not replenished effectively on the largest scales , and this is also consistent with the lack of a large - scale dynamo @xcite .",
    "the above analysis also relates to another well - studied problem within the literature , namely the origin of the lack of convergence with increasing resolution in unstratified , zero - net flux shearing - box simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we have shown above , unstratified , zero - net flux shearing - box simulations with periodic boundary conditions render the lorentz force term ineffective at injecting magnetic energy , and thus a large - scale mean field can not develop . hence , when a qss with turbulent transport of magnetic energy from larger to smaller scales establishes , it must suffice with the largest scale field available : a small - scale dynamo operates , for which the stress scales proportionately to the resistivity @xcite .",
    "commencing the simulation with a net radial / vertical field @xcite , or adopting alternative boundary conditions which permit the development of mean fields within a few orbital periods ( e.g. vertical field boundary conditions * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , enables convergence .",
    "our above analysis provides insight into why these strategies are successful .",
    "we now consider _ stratified _ shearing box simulations in which the vertical component of gravity is included . in the context of the current analysis , the results of zero - net flux simulations by @xcite and @xcite are useful as periodicity is applied at the boundaries of the computational domain ( including the vertical boundary at @xmath157 ) , in common with the unstratified simulations discussed in ",
    "[ subsubsec : sb ] .",
    "however , unlike the zero - net flux unstratified shearing - boxes described above , the @xcite models converge with increasing resolution .",
    "the crucial difference is that stratification provides a means for the disk to repartition magnetic flux so that the disk body can overcome the magnetic flux constraint and generate large scale magnetic fields .",
    "in essence , stratification introduces an internal open boundary between the disk body and the coronal region . from the results presented in @xcite",
    ", we infer this open boundary to lie at @xmath158 , which we adopt in the following analysis . with the boundaries @xmath159 and @xmath160 now not constrained to be periodic the integrated induction equations are : @xmath161 the non - periodic boundary conditions on the faces @xmath159 and @xmath162 introduce additional driving terms into the radial equation involving the terms @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "given the zero - net flux condition , these terms are important if the fluctuations in @xmath165 and @xmath166 or @xmath167 and @xmath168 are correlated .",
    "if this is the case , then eq  ( [ ssb : bx ] ) opens up the possibility of net radial field development and an @xmath110 dynamo .    considering the magnetic energy equation , we apply periodic boundaries in the azimuthal and radial directions and an open vertical boundary condition to eq  ( [ eqn : balance ] ) , and retain only the dominant terms , to obtain : @xmath169 where the additional term compared to the energy equation for an unstratified disk , eq  ( [ eqn : sb2 ] ) , arises from the work done on the disk - corona vertical boundary by maxwell stresses . despite the presence of the disk - corona interface , a large - scale vertical magnetic field does not develop ( see eq  [ ssb : bz ] ) .",
    "thus the second , third and fourth terms on the lhs of eq  ( [ eqn : ssb ] ) are negligible .",
    "we are left with : @xmath170 we conjecture that the @xcite simulations converge due to the terms involving @xmath167 and @xmath150 on the lhs of eq  ( [ eqn : ssb2 ] ) , where the introduction of stratification permits the development of a large scale radial magnetic field which combines with the azimuthal field to enable an @xmath110 dynamo to operate . as the simulation resolution is increased , the resolution of mri modes improves . at a critical resolution ,",
    "the most unstable wavelength becomes resolved and a further increase in resolution ceases to provide additional mri growth ( because wavelengths shorter than the most unstable mode are stable - * ? ? ?",

    "the contribution to the power input from maxwell stresses and lorentz forces ( the first and second terms on the lhs of eq  [ eqn : ssb2 ] ) asymptote towards constant values as radial and azimuthal mri mode growth converges .",
    "we note that the above argument is consistent with the results of @xcite , as the presence of a disk - corona interface relaxes the helicity conservation constraint for dynamo quenching .      in global stratified disk models , such as the ones",
    "we have described in this paper , periodic boundary conditions are applied in the azimuthal direction and the radial and vertical boundaries of the disk body are open . assuming symmetry about the mid - plane , one may take the vertical surfaces to be anti - periodic .",

    "the magnetic energy equation for this control volume , which follows from applying appropriate boundary conditions to the magnetic energy eq  ( [ eqn : balance ] ) and retaining the dominant terms , is : @xmath174 where the element of volume , @xmath175 , the surface element orthogonal to @xmath176 is @xmath177 , and the surface element orthogonal to @xmath178 is @xmath179 .",
    "as noted in the last paragraph of   [ subsec : mag_energy ] , the rate of work done by maxwell stresses on the inner radial boundary is far greater than that done on the outer radial and vertical ( @xmath31-direction ) boundaries , so that the second term on the lhs of eq  ( [ eqn : global ] ) dominates the first and third terms .",
    "also , the largest contributor to @xmath180 is @xmath181 .",
    "hence , @xmath182 note the similarity of the above equation with that governing the stratified shearing - box simulations ( eq  [ eqn : ssb2 ] ) .",
    "the distinct difference is in the magnitude of the terms on the lhs , which depend on @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and the radial gradient of @xmath184 .",
    "similar to the stratified shearing - box , for magnetic energy production and dissipation to converge , the growth of @xmath185 and @xmath184 must be well resolved .",
    "in contrast , however , because of the large - scale radial gradient in @xmath184 which is present in a global model ( see , e.g. , figure 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but which is suppressed by periodic radial boundary conditions in a shearing - box , the second term is larger in a global model .",
    "this term is appreciable in magnitude for a global disk with open radial and vertical boundaries as a result of the development of a significant net radial field .",
    "we can indicate how this arises by considering the integrated induction equation for the radial field , this time in spherical polar coordinates , with periodic azimuthal boundary conditions , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath186 in this equation we have omitted the resistive diffusive terms in order to concentrate on the driving terms for @xmath187 and we have made use of the approximate anti - symmetry of the @xmath188 and @xmath189 surfaces .    returning to the implications for the magnetic energy equation , we note that since periodicity is not applied to maxwell stresses doing work on the radial boundaries in a global model , they contribute more power .",
    "therefore , in a global model , lorentz forces within the volume and maxwell stresses at the boundaries of the disk inject more power at a lower resolutions than they do in a shearing - box .",
    "we emphasise that this is the result of radially periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , keeping the cell aspect ratio constant and progressively increasing simulation resolution as we have done with models gbl - lr , gbl - sr , and gbl - hr , and as @xcite did with their stratified shearing - box simulations , one should achieve apparent convergence in @xmath190 at lower simulation resolutions ( i.e. cells/@xmath34 in the vertical direction ) for global disk simulations than for stratified shearing - box simulations ; @xcite found convergence at 64 - 128 cells/@xmath34 in the vertical direction , whereas we find convergence at @xmath191 cells/@xmath34 in the vertical direction ( see tables  [ tab : model_list ] and [ tab : global_models ] ) .    comparing the magnitude of the surface integral terms on the lhs of eqs  ( [ eqn : ssb2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : global2 ] ) , for the magnetic energy of the unstratified shearing - box and global stratified disk respectively",
    ", we find that @xmath192 is greater than @xmath193 by a factor of a few tens .",
    "hence , a global disk more readily supports a high @xmath194 because the radial boundary condition allows more power to be delivered to the disk body to counteract the removal of energy by turbulent dissipation ( @xmath195 ) . stating this in a more general context , periodic boundary conditions on the magnetic field prevent the establishment of large - scale gradients in the maxwell stresses , restricting the power that can be delivered to the disk by lorentz forces and surface stresses .",
    "we note , however , that in the absence of an explicit resistivity , simulations performed at different resolutions will , at some late time , diverge .",
    "this is because in the quasi - steady state the disk is continuing to evolve on the ( slow ) resistive timescale .",
    "if one relies on numerical resistivity , this timescale is dictated by @xmath94 .",
    "we anticipate that as global disk simulations integrated over many hundreds of orbits become more feasible , this result will be realised .",
    "in fact , the results of @xcite already show this for unstratified global disk simulations .",
    "we complete this analysis by considering the global _ unstratified _ disk models presented by @xcite showing what differences the vertical periodic boundary conditions make in that case .",
    "we have presented in eqs  ( [ induction_x ] ) - ( [ induction_z ] ) the volume - integrated induction equations appropriate for cartesian shearing boxes .",
    "@xcite employ cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath196 so that we present the following induction equations in that coordinate system .",
    "we are interested in the driving terms for these components so that we omit the diffusive terms in these equations , which have a complex form and do not add anything to the discussion .",
    "the volume - integrated equations , assuming periodicity in the azimuthal direction are : @xmath197 where the element of volume @xmath198 and the respective elements of area are @xmath199 ( orthogonal to @xmath200 ) and @xmath201 ( orthogonal to @xmath202 ) .",
    "@xcite use open radial boundaries and periodic boundary conditions in the vertical and azimuthal direction .",
    "@xcite use open radial boundaries and periodic boundary conditions in the vertical and azimuthal direction .",
    "since the radial boundaries are open , eq  ( [ bzcyl_vol ] ) shows that a mean vertical field can grow irrespective of whether it is initially zero .",
    "however , with a periodic @xmath127-boundary , the rhs of eq  ( [ brcyl_vol ] ) is identically zero and a large scale radial field can not develop .",
    "hence , in this case , the magnetic energy equation with only dominant terms retained reads , @xmath203 where we have adopted cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath196 ) for consistency with the work of @xcite .",
    "the second and third terms in this equation are likely to be small compared to the first ( and will contribute little to maintaining magnetic power on the largest scales ) , because there is no large - scale radial field , and because the disk is unstratified so that there is no appreciable vertical gradient in @xmath184 .",
    "hence , eq  ( [ eqn : global3 ] ) simplifies to , @xmath204 where the remaining maxwell stress term provides the power input on the largest scales .",
    "note that this term does not require a large - scale net / mean radial field , and has a considerable magnitude purely due to open radial boundary conditions causing a contrast in surface integrals at opposing boundaries .",
    "the apparent convergence in @xmath194 present in the results of @xcite therefore hinges on adequate resolution of the radial and azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "hence , one may anticipate that stratified and unstratified global models will converge at the same resolution .",
    "this is apparent from a comparison of our results with those of @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that although stratified and unstratified global models do appear to converge at similar resolutions , this may be facilitated by different mechanisms in each case .",
    "essentially , because a mean radial field can not develop in an unstratified global model , maintenance of large scale magnetic energy is not facilitated by a large - scale @xmath110 dynamo , but must be aided by some other mechanism - see , for example , @xcite .",
    "hence , by construction , periodic vertical boundary conditions place more demand on the azimuthal and vertical fields to sustain turbulent energy on the largest scales . considering that astrophysical disks are stratified",
    ", this seems an unrealistic approximation to a real disk .",
    "c +      the time variability of the mean magnetic field components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meanb ] ) is indicative of an @xmath110 dynamo in our stratified global disk models .",
    "furthermore , mean radial and vertical fields develop within the first few orbital periods of the simulation . the radial and azimuthal mean magnetic fields show anti - correlated oscillations , the period of which is not obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : meanb ] .",
    "this may be the result of averaging over a wide range of radii @xcite , or could be due to additional terms contributing to the evolution of the mean fields when the boundaries of the disk body are open - see the integrated induction equations in   [ subsubsec : global ] .",
    "a connection between the vertical magnetic field and the radial and azimuthal fields is less apparent , although there is a faint suggestion of oscillations in @xmath205 with a period on the order of @xmath206 .",
    "global three - dimensional simulations of magnetorotationally turbulent disks have been presented to investigate convergence with increasing simulation resolution , magnetic energy , and quasi - steady self - sustaining turbulence . a primary result of this work is convergence with increasing resolution at an @xmath81-parameter , @xmath207 , occurring at a resolution of the order of 12 - 51 cells/@xmath34 in radius , 27 cells/@xmath34 in the vertical direction , and 12.5 cells/@xmath34 in the azimuthal direction .",
    "a control volume analysis applied to the body of the disk reveals the dominant magnetic energy production to be the result of the combination of maxwell stresses and shear in the mean disk rotation .",
    "magnetic energy is primarily removed by dissipation , with a negligible amount of energy being advected out of the disk body in either the radial or vertical directions .",
    "compressibility , or to be more exact expansion , also contributes to the removal of magnetic energy , but to a far lesser extent than dissipation .",
    "the control volume analysis also allows the numerical resistivity of the simulation code to be evaluated .",
    "the results reveal that sustained , slowly diminishing turbulence can operate at @xmath208 , in contrast to the conclusions of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that magnetorotational turbulence should cease to function effectively at such values of @xmath102 .",
    "this may be indicating that an effective large - scale dynamo can operate at low magnetic reynolds number in global disks .",
    "the convergence with resolution found from our global simulations occurs at roughly a factor of three lower resolution than found for stratified shearing - box simulations by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references there - in ) .",
    "we have shown how this result , as well as the convergence properties of unstratified shearing - boxes @xcite and global disks @xcite can be understood in terms of balancing creation and dissipation of magnetic energy subject to boundary conditions and magnetic field configuration . in particular , using periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction ( as in shearing - box simulations ) reduces the magnitude of a lorentz force term which depends on @xmath183 and the radial gradient in @xmath184 .",
    "this term significantly contributes to magnetic energy injection , and in global models ( which use open radial boundaries ) is larger due to the presence of large scale radial gradients .",
    "hence , this term requires lower simulation resolution to achieve the same power in a global model .",
    "our results highlight important differences between shearing - boxes and global disks which indicate the importance of basing future deductions on stratified global models .",
    "in closing we note that the results of this paper concern global disks with a small net vertical magnetic field in the turbulent state .",
    "a growing number of shearing - box studies are engaging in the challenging task of modelling net flux magnetic fields in stratified disks @xcite .",
    "therefore , re - visiting the analysis in this paper in the context of net vertical flux fields would be a useful avenue for future work .",
    "furthermore , the control volume analysis we have used to derive the numerical resistivity could be applied to recent orbital advection / fargo schemes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
