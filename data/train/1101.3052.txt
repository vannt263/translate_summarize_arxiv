    "when self - interested users share resources non - cooperatively , it is common that the resources are utilized suboptimally from a global point of view @xcite .",
    "hence , overcoming the suboptimal performance of non - cooperative outcomes poses an important challenge for successful resource utilization .",
    "the aforementioned phenomenon is widely observed in wireless communications , where users compete for radio resources interfering with each other . for the sake of discussion , consider the following abstract scenario of resource sharing in communications .",
    "first , users determine their resource usage levels , which in turn determine the service quality they receive . in general , as the overall usage level increases , the service quality is reduced due to interference or congestion .",
    "the payoff of a user is determined by its own usage level as well as the service quality . in such a scenario , users tend to choose a higher usage level than the socially optimal one . that is , it is in the self - interest of users to choose a high usage level , although reducing their usage levels simultaneously would benefit all of them . in game theory ,",
    "such a conflict between private and social interests is modeled as the prisoner s dilemma game . in the literature",
    ", it has been shown that various wireless communication scenarios exhibit a prisoner s dilemma phenomenon , including packet forwarding @xcite , distributed spectrum allocation @xcite , and medium access control ( csma / ca @xcite and slotted aloha @xcite ) .",
    "incentive schemes are needed to improve the performance of non - cooperative outcomes . in this paper",
    ", we propose a class of incentive schemes based on the idea of intervention .",
    "implementing an intervention scheme requires an intervention device that is able to monitor the actions of users and to affect their resource usage .",
    "an intervention manager first chooses an intervention rule used by the intervention device , and then users choose their actions knowing the intervention rule chosen by the manager . after observing a signal about the actions of users , the intervention device chooses its action according to the intervention rule .",
    "the manager chooses an intervention rule to maximize his payoff , anticipating the rational behavior of users given the intervention rule .",
    "the payoff of the manager can be considered as a measure of the system performance , which can incorporate various efficiency and fairness criteria .",
    "we formulate the interaction between users and a manager as an intervention game and propose a solution concept called intervention equilibrium .",
    "intervention equilibrium predicts the outcome of an intervention game in terms of an intervention rule chosen by the manager and an operating point chosen by users .",
    "intervention can be classified into two types , called type 1 and type 2 , depending on how the intervention device acts in the system relative to users . in type-1 intervention ,",
    "the intervention device acts in a symmetric way as users do while having the ability to monitor the actions of other users .",
    "an example of type-1 intervention can be found in @xcite and @xcite , which consider a random access network where an intervention device interferes with other users by transmitting its packets after obtaining information about the transmission probabilities of users . in type-2 intervention ,",
    "the intervention device acts as a gatekeeper which can control resource usage by users .",
    "an example of type-2 intervention can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzes scheduling mechanisms where a scheduler assigns different priorities to traffic flows depending on their input rates , and @xcite considers a packet dropping mechanism where the server determines the probability of dropping packets as a function of the total arrival rate .",
    "the two types of intervention can be applied to the aforementioned resource sharing scenario , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resource ] .",
    "the goal of intervention schemes to improve the performance of non - cooperative outcomes is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : twouser ] with two users and the system performance measured by the average payoff of the two users .",
    "our analysis is aimed at answering the following two questions .    1 .",
    "when can we construct an intervention scheme that improves the suboptimal performance of non - cooperative equilibrium ?",
    "2 .   when can we construct an intervention scheme that achieves the best feasible performance ?",
    "our analysis suggests that the answers to these questions depend on the ability of the intervention device :    * ability to monitor the actions of users ( i.e. , monitoring technology ) , * ability to affect the payoffs of users through its actions ( i.e. , intervention capability ) .",
    "the discussion on the example in section  [ sec : ex1 ] shows that an intervention scheme can improve the performance of non - cooperative equilibrium when the monitoring technology is sufficiently accurate .",
    "this result is reinforced by the analytical results and the example in section  [ sec : permon ] , which considers the case of perfect monitoring .",
    "the analytical result in section  [ sec : impmon ] shows that intervention schemes may not achieve the best feasible performance when the monitoring technology is noisy . on the other hand ,",
    "the analytical results and the example in section  [ sec : permon ] show that intervention schemes can achieve the best feasible performance when monitoring is perfect and the intervention device has a sufficiently strong intervention capability .",
    "when signals are noisy , the manager can provide incentives by triggering a punishment following signals that are more likely to occur when users deviate .",
    "when these signals occur with positive probability even when users do not deviate , punishment happens from time to time at equilibrium , which results in a performance loss . on the contrary ,",
    "when signals are perfectly accurate , punishment through intervention can be used only as a threat , which is never used at equilibrium .",
    "thus , in the case of perfect monitoring , it is possible for the manager to achieve a desired operating point without incurring a performance loss .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate intervention games , develop a solution concept of intervention equilibrium , and show its existence in a finite intervention game . in sections  [ sec : noisy ] and [ sec : permon ] , we derive analytical results and discuss illustrative examples in the cases of imperfect and perfect monitoring , respectively . in section  [ sec :",

    "one such method is to use contractual agreements .",
    "contract theory is a field of economics that studies how economic actors form contractual agreements , covering the topics of incentives , information , and institutions @xcite .",
    "since intervention schemes aim to motivate users to take appropriate actions , our work shares a theme as well as a formal framework with contract theory . however , most works in contract theory deal with the principal - agent problem using monetary payment as the incentive device ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , our work focuses on the problem of regulating selfish behavior in resource sharing by using intervention within the system as the incentive device .    in game theory ,",
    "correlated equilibrium is a solution concept that extends nash equilibrium and thus has the potential to improve nash equilibrium .",
    "a correlated equilibrium can be implemented by having a mediator who determines an action profile following a correlated distribution and makes a confidential recommendation to each player @xcite . in an intervention game",
    ", the manager recommends a pure or mixed action profile to users but does not use a correlated distribution to determine the target action profile .",
    "another difference is that an intervention scheme uses an external punishment device to prevent deviation , which is not present in the concept of correlated equilibrium .",
    "we also note that , for the prisoner s dilemma game where there is a dominant strategy for each player , the set of correlated equilibria coincides with that of nash equilibria .",
    "this suggests that correlated equilibrium is more useful for inducing coordination ( see , for example , @xcite , which considers a multiple access network ) than for achieving cooperation in a prisoner s dilemma scenario , as considered in this paper .",
    "another method used in game theory to expand the set of nash equilibria is repeated games . in a repeated game",
    ", players monitor their behavior and choose their actions based on past observations ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for works that apply the idea of repeated games to wireless communications ) . implementing an incentive scheme based on a repeated game strategy requires long - term relationship among interacting users , which may not exist especially in mobile , cognitive , and vehicular networks .",
    "moreover , a repeated game strategy should be designed in accord with the self - interest of players in order to ensure that they execute monitoring and punishment or reward in a planned way . on the contrary",
    ", an intervention scheme uses an external device for monitoring and executing punishment .",
    "hence , it can provide incentives for a dynamically changing population , and the manager can prescribe any feasible intervention rule according to his objective .    in the communications literature , stackelberg games have been used to improve nash equilibrium ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "stackelberg games divide users into two groups , a leader and followers , and the leader takes an action before the followers do . in intervention games ,",
    "the manager is the leader while users are followers , and the manager chooses an intervention rule , which is a contingent plan , instead of an action .",
    "thus , intervention games are more suitable than stackelberg games when the leader is not a resource user but a manager who regulates resource sharing by users .",
    "pricing schemes or taxation can also be used to induce individuals to take socially desirable actions .",
    "intervention affects the payoffs of users by directly influencing their resource usage , whereas pricing does so by using an outside instrument , money .",
    "thus , intervention schemes can be implemented more robustly in that users can not avoid intervention as long as they use resources . in order to achieve a desired outcome through an incentive scheme",
    ", the manager needs to know the impact of the incentive device on the payoffs of users .",
    "since intervention affects the payoffs of users through physical quantities associated with resource usage ( e.g. , throughput , delay ) , which are easily measurable , this information is easier to obtain when the manager uses an intervention scheme than a pricing scheme , as discussed at the end of section  [ sec : ex1 ] .",
    "lastly , we discuss the difference between intervention and mechanism design in the sense of ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "23 ) . in a mechanism design problem",
    ", the designer aims to obtain the private information of agents while he can control the social choice ( e.g. , a resource allocation ) . on the contrary , in an intervention game , the manager aims to motivate users to take appropriate actions while he has complete information about users ( i.e. , no private information ) .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a game - theoretic framework for the design and analysis of intervention schemes , which are aimed to drive self - interested users towards a system objective .",
    "our results suggest that the manager can construct an effective intervention scheme when he has an intervention device with an accurate monitoring technology and a strong intervention capability .",
    "we have illustrated our framework and results with simple resource sharing scenarios in wireless communications .",
    "however , the application of intervention schemes is not limited to the problems considered in this paper ; our framework can be applied to a much broader set of problems in communications , including power control and flow control , as well as to various types of networks such as cognitive radio , vehicular networks , peer - to - peer networks , and crowdsourcing websites .",
    "exploring the role of intervention in various specific scenarios is left for future research .",
    "another direction of future research is to combine intervention with other game - theoretic concepts .",
    "first , we can introduce intervention in repeated games , where users and the intervention device choose their actions depending on their past observations .",
    "we can also allow the intervention manager to use a correlated distribution , as in correlated equilibrium , when he determines the target action profile .",
    "intervention can then be exerted when a user deviates from the recommended action .",
    "we can use the idea of mechanism design to deal with a scenario where the intervention manager has incomplete information about users .",
    "in such a scenario , the manager first obtains reports from users and then chooses an intervention rule depending on the reports .",
    "finally , intervention can be used in the context of bargaining games , where the set of feasible payoffs in a bargaining game is obtained from sustainable action profiles .",
    "first , note that @xmath351 .",

    "we consider three cases .    _ case 1 : _ @xmath356 .    in this case , @xmath152 is satisfied for all @xmath148 $ ] , and @xmath145 is increasing on @xmath357 $ ] .",
