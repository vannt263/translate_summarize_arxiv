    "young circumstellar disks around pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars are thought to host the birth of planets .",
    "according to the core accretion scenario , the formation of planets involves a variety of physical mechanisms from the coagulation of sub-@xmath1 m sized particles up to the gas - accretion phase leading to the build up of gas giants .",
    "one of the most critical steps which is left to be explained is how this growth of solids proceeds from mm / cm - sized dust grains to km - sized rocks , called planetesimals .",
    "this is crucial because it is from the gravitational - driven collision of these planetesimals that both the rocky earth - like planets and the rocky cores of giant planets are ultimately supposed to be formed .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain the formation of planetesimals . in general , these mechanisms induce the local accumulation of particles with sizes of @xmath2  mm at densities which are high enough to make these clumps unstable to gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to well characterize the early phases of coagulation of small dust grains in order to set the right initial conditions for the mechanisms governing the formation of planetesimals .",
    "recently , sophisticated models of dust evolution in disks including several effects like dust coagulation , fragmentation and radial motions , have been built @xcite .",
    "continuum observations in the ( sub-)millimeter constrain fundamental parameters of the dust population in the disk , e.g. the total dust mass , the radial - dependent dust surface density , and the size distribution of dust grains at sizes of about @xmath3  mm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these observational constraints can be used to test the models of dust evolution and shed light onto the first stages of planetesimal formation @xcite .",
    "the recent initial upgrades of the very large array into the expanded very large array ( evla ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allowed a significant increase in continuum sensitivity at long wavelengths .",
    "we present new evla observations at about 7  mm of the 253 - 1536 binary system in the orion nebula cluster .",
    "the projected angular separation of the two pms stars is about 1.1  @xmath4 which corresponds to a projected physical separation of 460  au at the onc distance of @xmath5 420  pc  @xcite .",
    "optical images with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has revealed the presence of a large disk seen in absorbtion around the east companion , 253 - 1536a .",
    "@xcite observed the binary at 0.88  mm with the sub - millimeter array ( sma ) and estimated for the 253 - 1536a disk a mass of about 0.07  @xmath6 which makes this disk the most massive ever observed in the onc .",
    "they also detected a fainter disk around the other pms star , 253 - 1536b , and found a ratio for the two disk masses of about 4 .",
    "we obtained new evla data under the project 10b-102 , with a total observing time of 6 hours . at the time of observations",
    "the evla was in the c configuration , and provided a total bandwidth of 256  mhz , that we centered at the frequency of 43.280  ghz ( 6.9  mm ) in the q - band .",
    "passband and absolute flux calibration was performed through observations of the qso 3c147 ( j0542@xmath74951 ) .",
    "amplitude and phase calibration was obtained by observing the qso j0607@xmath80834 .",
    "the measured 6.9  mm - flux density of j0607@xmath80834 range from about 1.9  jy to 2.1  jy during the three observing runs , thus showing a discrepancy in the fluxes which is within the @xmath9-uncertainty on the absolute flux , as typically estimated for evla observations in the q - band .",
    "the raw visibilities were calibrated using the common astronomy software applications ( _ casa _ ) package .",
    "maps of the continuum emission were derived by adopting natural weighting to maximize the observations sensitivity , and photometry was obtained through gaussian fitting in the image plane using the ` imfit ` task in _",
    "casa_. the resulting synthesized beam has sizes of about @xmath10 .",
    "the measured rms - noise of the final map is about 35  @xmath1jy .",
    "we observed 253 - 1536 with xshooter at the eso - vlt on september 27 , 2010 .",
    "we obtained complete spectra from 330 through 2500  nm at a spectral resolution in the range 5000 - 9000 .",
    "we aligned the @xmath11  arcsec slit along the binary position angle to observe the two components simultaneously .",
    "we performed an on - slit dithering pattern with 8 exposures of 190s each , to avoid saturation on the brightest component and to efficiently remove sky emission , bad pixels and cosmic ray hits .",
    "we reduced the data using the standard xshooter pipeline recipes , and iraf for extraction of the 1d spectra and subsequent analysis .",
    "we used spectra of ltt  1020 and hip  025028 ( b3v ) to correct for instrumental response and telluric absorption .",
    "the spectrum of the bright component is detected with very high signal - to - noise across the whole spectral range , while the faint component of the binary system is only detected at k and h bands and can not be easily separated from the glow of the other component at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we detect numerous absorption and emission features in the two spectra . nevertheless , for the purpose of this letter we just analysed the spectra to attempt a spectral classification of the two components of the binary .",
    "we compared our spectra with those from the spectral libraries of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that the bright stellar component of the binary , i.e. 253 - 1536b , is consistent with previous classification as an m2 star both based on the optical and near infrared spectrum .",
    "the faint component , 253 - 1536a , does not show prominent absorption lines",
    ". in particular , it is laking co , fe , al and ca features that are commonly observed in k - band spectra of late type dwarfs .",
    "overall the spectrum seems to be consistent with heavily veiled and extincted late f and g types . in this paper",
    "we will consider a spectral type of g2 for the 253 - 1536a pms star .",
    "the contours in figure  [ fig : map2 ] show the evla map at 6.9  mm superimposed to the hst image in h@xmath0 .",
    "both the disks are clearly detected at 6.9  mm , and the measured fluxes are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] , together with the ones measured with the sma array at 0.88  mm @xcite .",
    "continuum observations of young circumstellar disks in the sub - mm probe the emission from dust particles . at longer millimeter wavelengths",
    "the dust emission can be contaminated by ionized gas , with ionization driven by x - ray / uv - radiation generated either by nearby young massive stars , e.g. in the trapezium cluster @xcite , or by the pms star at the center of the disk , as seen for disks in low mass sfrs @xcite .    in the case of the 253 - 1536 system ,",
    "the distance to the @xmath12 ori c massive star , i.e. @xmath5 1  pc in projection ( see fig .  [ fig : map ] ) , is too large to make the gas in the disks being significantly ionized by the @xmath12 ori c uv - radiation .",
    "this is indicated by the lack , in these onc peripheral regions , of photoevaporating proplyds with bright ionization cusps pointing toward the direction of @xmath12 ori c in the hst images @xcite . at the same time , a bright rim of ionized gas is visible in both the hst and evla maps on the east side of the binary system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map2 ] ) .",
    "the star which is causing this feature is probably nu  orionis , an early b - type star located toward the direction of the bright rim , which is also responsable for the excitation of the m43 hii region @xcite .    to evaluate the relative impact of dust and ionized gas emission at a given frequency ,",
    "the slope of the sed can be used : dust thermal emission presents a steep spectrum , with values of the spectral index @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) between about 2 and 3 , whereas the ionized gas emission is characterized by a much more shallow dependence on frequency , e.g. @xmath15 for a symmetric , ionized , optically thick wind @xcite , and @xmath16 for optically thin emission @xcite . for the 253 - 1536 system",
    ", @xcite measured a spectral index of @xmath17 between 0.88 and 2.9  mm .",
    "since the observations at 2.9  mm did not spatially resolve the binary system , this value is descriptive of the whole system rather than of the two disks separately . by adding up the 6.9  mm - flux densities for the two disks , the spectral index of the whole system is @xmath18 between 2.9 and 6.9  mm and @xmath19 between 0.88 and 6.9  mm .",
    "both the measured absolute values of the spectral indeces , and the fact that no statistically - significant changes are seen in the slope of the spectrum between 0.88 and 6.9  mm suggest that the dust dominates the total sub - mm / mm emission .",
    "this is consistent with what found also for 216 - 0939 , another hst - identified disk in the northern outskirts of the onc @xcite . in the following",
    "we will therefore assume that the measured sub - mm / mm fluxes are only due to thermal emission from dust particles in the disks .",
    "columns 5,6 : ranges of gas surface densities and dust temperatures constrained in the disk outer regions ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "these values have been obtained by adopting the dust model described in @xcite . however , note that for our analysis , only the ratio of the surface densities and dust temperatures in the two disks is relevant . a model with @xmath20au and @xmath21 can not reproduce the observed fluxes for 253 - 1536b .",
    "the @xmath22-index carries information on the size @xmath23 of the largest grains in the dust population of the outer disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath22-values lower than about @xmath24 can only be explained with the presence of grains as large as at least @xmath25 mm .",
    "converting an estimate for @xmath22 into one for @xmath23 is particularly difficult because of our ignorance on the phsyical / chemical properties of the probed dust .",
    "however , for all the dust models considered in the literature , a general anticorrelation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is generally obtained for @xmath26 . under the assumption that the chemistry / shape of the dust grains in the two disks is the same and considering that the dust evolution models in disks with the constrained physical properties predict a slope @xmath27 which is nearly identical @xcite , this means that the observational data indicate that the 253 - 1536a disk , with a lower @xmath22 , contains larger grains in its outer regions than 253 - 1536b . by considering the same dust model adopted in @xcite , and varying the assumed @xmath27-value between 2 and 3",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inferred @xmath23 in the 253 - 1536a disk is larger than in the companion disk by factors of about @xmath28 , depending on the values for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the 253 - 1536b disk .          between the maximum grain size allowed by fragmentation , the gas surface density @xmath32 , the viscosity @xmath33-parameter @xcite , the thermal speed @xmath34 , the critical velocity @xmath35 above which two grains fragment after colliding , and the grain density @xmath36 ( see * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by assuming that the chemical composition and shape of dust grains in the two disks of the binary system is the same , the highly uncertain term @xmath37 in eq",
    "[ eq : amax_til ] cancels out when taking the ratio of @xmath23 in the two disks :      where @xmath39 is the dust temperature in the disk midplane .",
    "this means that observational constraints on the ratio of @xmath23 in different disks allow to test models of dust evolution in disks without basing the whole analysis on parameters whose values are very uncertain .",
    "equations  [ eq : amax_til ] and [ eq : amax_ratio ] are valid locally in the disk .",
    "however , as noted above , our observations do not have enough angular resolution to properly resolve the disk structure and directly constrain the radial dependence of quantities like e.g. the dust surface density .",
    "the estimates obtained above on the dust properties in the two disks are referred to the disk regions which dominate the emission at long wavelengths , i.e. the outer regions .",
    "we can therefore attempt a comparison between the predictions of the dust evolution models and our observational results in the disk `` outer regions '' , which have to be properly defined .",
    "since the two disks have very different outer radii , the spatial regions probed by their ( sub-)mm sed are different . according to the two - layer disk models , more than 50% of the total sub - mm emission from 253 - 1536a comes from regions with stellocentric radii @xmath40au , whereas for 253 - 1536b the same fraction of emission comes from @xmath41au .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : models ] for the @xmath42 case , in these regions the 253 - 1536b disk is denser than 253 - 1536a by a factor of about @xmath43 , and colder by a factor of about 1.2 - 1.4 . by including these values in eq .",
    "[ eq : amax_ratio ] , and assuming the same @xmath33-value in the two disks , it is evident that the models of dust evolution would predict significantly larger grains in the 253 - 1536b disk , which is contrary to what was derived in the last section .",
    "this result does not change even when considering other possible @xmath44-values for the power - law index of the disk surface density between 0 and 1.5 .    to reconcile the prediction of the models of dust evolution with the ratios of @xmath23 reported in section  [ sec : grain_growth ] , the viscosity @xmath33-parameter in the 253 - 1536b disk has to be larger than in the companion disk by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "physically , this is because to explain the smaller grains observed in the outer regions of the 253 - 1536b disk , the turbulence velocity , which is roughly proportional to @xmath45 , has to be very high to increase the relative velocities between solid particles thus making fragmentation more efficient .",
    "although different @xmath33-values could in principle be present in the two disks , magneto - rotational simulations of protoplanetary disks predict that larger values of @xmath33 are typically obtained in environments with lower densities @xcite , which is the opposite of what requested by the dust evolution models to explain the observational results for the 253 - 1536 binary system .",
    "the fact that larger grains are seen in environments with lower densities probably suggests that radial motion of particles in the disks , a phenomenon which is not included when deriving this prediction , plays a fundamental role in the redistribution of solid particles in protoplanetary disks .",
    "this is also what @xcite suggested to reconcile the predictions of these same models with the measured sub - mm fluxes of isolated disks in taurus and ophiuchus sfrs .",
    "high angular resolution and high sensitivity observations with alma and evla will allow us to test the dust evolution models locally in the disk , and possibly to probe viscosity with high spectral and spatial resolution observations of gas .",
