    "galaxian dark matter has been recognized for over 70 years ( zwicky 1933 ) , and tied in part to the halo for over 30 ( rubin & ford 1970 ) .",
    "halo dark matter s nature is still a mystery .",
    "gravitational microlensing can reveal individual dark matter objects of roughly stellar mass ( paczyski 1986 ) . to test this , macho observed the magellanic clouds for 5.7 years , ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) and eros ( afonso et al .  2003 ) did so for 5 . the former report microlensing events more common than the known , purely stellar expectation , with lensing fraction @xmath3% of the dark matter halo mass ( 8 - 50% , with 95% confidence ) of @xmath40.4 @xmath5 masses .",
    "eros found @xmath6 consistent with zero ( but marginally consistent with @xmath3% ) .",
    "m31 microlensing could potentially settle this quandary definitively ( crotts 1992 ) .",
    "since we can explore microlensing across the face of m31 , we can use this distribution to distinguish where in the galaxy the lenses arise .",
    "several surveys of m31 microlensing ( riffeser et al .",
    "2003 , joshi et al .",
    "2004 , calchi - novati et al .",
    "2005 , including mega : de jong et al .",
    "2004 and its predecessor vatt - columbia : uglesich et al .",
    "2004 ) , together report @xmath420 probable microlensing events , and have a tendency to confirm the macho result .    with its crowded target stars ,",
    "m31 microlensing relies on image subtraction to reveal event lightcurves , which removes the baseline flux . using @xmath0 to recover the source flux ( e.g. ansari et al .",
    "1999 , aurire et al .",
    "2001 ) , one can compute event amplification , hence einstein parameters , constraining physical parameters e.g. , lens mass .",
    "mega and vatt - columbia also use source star color to distinguish microlensing from variable stars , since very red variables ( miras and semiregulars ) produce outbursts that , with their baselines subtracted , mimic point - source , point - lens ( `` paczyski '' ) light curves ( uglesich et al .",
    "residual flux from these events , however , is redder than almost all potential microlensing source stars .",
    "mega will soon publish its microlensing sample , and now is an excellent opportunity to check these event selection criteria .",
    "-0.15 in   -0.3 in    to study candidate events we appeal to superior @xmath0 angular resolution : 160 acs and wfpc2 images , taken in f555w and f814w filters in 16 orbits , cover 0.17 deg@xmath7 , @xmath430% of the mega field . here",
    "we study the largest sample of candidate microlensing events , the int / wfc subsample of mega ( de jong et al .",
    "2005 ) , in order to understand and improve ground - based selection criteria .",
    "the analysis used is detailed by cseresnjes et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "we carefully align the @xmath0 and ground - based images by matching catalogs of ground - based versus gaussian - convolved @xmath0 sources for each filter combination ( @xmath0 , f555w / f814w versus int , @xmath8 and kpno 4 m , r / i ) , providing up to 8 different position estimates . for a given ground - based position , the two independent @xmath0 positions ( via f555w and f814w ) always agree to @xmath9 ( typically @xmath10 ) , so positional accuracy depends mainly on ground - based data .",
    "the adopted position is a weighted average of individual estimates ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spread of different estimates for each event are @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "of five microlensing candidates analyzed , we identify three sources and find flux upper limits for two .",
    "@xmath0 data were photometered with daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , as prescribed in sirianni et al .",
    "the locations of the candidate microlensing sources on a color - magnitude diagram are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for each candidate event , we normalized the differential light curves to r - fluxes , using color - magnitude diagrams and @xmath0 baseline fluxes ( for the two undetected events , using the baseline flux upper limit ) , then performed a paczynski fit in ( @xmath13 ) to the combined light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for the two undetected events , the resulting @xmath14 corresponds to a lower limit .",
    "only the einstein time - scale ( @xmath14 ) constrains lens characteristics , particularly its mass @xmath15 . for a given time - scale @xmath16 ,",
    "the lens - mass probability distribution is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the event rate @xcite .",
    "we consider alternatively a lens located in the halo of m31 , in the disk or in the bulge . for halo lensing",
    ", we consider the simple case where the lens is part of a spherical isothermal halo composed of single mass objects , with a density distribution defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radial distance to the center of m31 , and @xmath21 is a core radius of @xmath22 kpc .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the lenses is set to @xmath23 km  s@xmath24 , consistent with a rotation curve of @xmath25 km  s@xmath24 .",
    "the disk is modelled by a double exponential with a radial scale length of @xmath26 kpc and a vertical scale length of @xmath27 pc .",
    "the bulge corresponds to the `` small '' bulge model of kent ( 1989 ) , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath28 km  s@xmath24 .",
