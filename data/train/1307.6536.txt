    "the standard scenario of cosmic structure formation relies on the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "although this model fits most of the data surprisingly well , there remain , e.g. , the puzzle of missing satellites @xcite and the cusp - core problem @xcite .",
    "more recently , the planck satellite has observed much fewer clusters than predicted @xcite .",
    "this would be a  cluster version \" of the missing satellites problem .",
    "all these apparent shortcomings of the @xmath0cdm model have in common that pressureless cold dark matter ( cdm ) leads to an excess of structure and clustering .",
    "now , although dark matter is certainly very close to be pressureless , its equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath1 is not necessarily zero exactly @xcite .",
    "indeed , the eos parameter of a nonrelativistic gas in thermal equilibrium calculated from kinetic theory is of the order of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there are also investigations about effects of a nonvanishing eos parameter using observations of gravitational lensing @xcite , gravitational dynamics at galactic scales @xcite , at galaxy cluster scales @xcite and at cosmological scales @xcite .",

    "newtonian cosmology is well established since many decades @xcite . however , its applicability is related to the circumstance that cdm is assumed to be pressureless . the results of n - body simulations which are crucial for modern cosmology are based on pure newtonian codes . but",
    "as soon as there appears a nonvanishing dark - matter pressure contribution , even if it is a tiny one , the applicability of the newtonian approximation has to be reconsidered .    in this paper",
    "we address the question to what extent a newtonian approximation remains reliable if ( small ) deviations from @xmath3 are taken into account . whether or not newtonian simulations are missing",
    "any ( relativistic ) aspect at the largest scales is a matter of intense debate in the literature @xcite .",
    "our focus here will be on scales smaller than the hubble scale .",
    "in particular , we aim at clarifying the potential role of small pressure effects for the evolution of dark matter inhomogeneities .",
    "we shall demonstrate that in this situation one can no longer trust the standard newtonian approximation . on the other hand , a neo - newtonian generalization which is able to incorporate pressure effects , yields results that well approximate those of an exact general relativistic treatment .",
    "following a previous analysis @xcite , we shall consider viscous cdm ( vcdm ) in which dissipative effects give rise to a small bulk viscous pressure . while physically an effective bulk viscous pressure should be the result of a self - interaction within the dark matter , our approach",
    "will be entirely phenomenological , using eckart s theory @xcite of dissipative processes .",
    "we do not assume that this viscous pressure is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe as in @xcite .",

    "equations ( [ continuity1 ] ) and ( [ euler1 ] ) are the continuity and the euler equations , respectively . they provide a fluid picture of the cosmic medium which is gravitationally self - interacting via the poisson equation ( [ poisson1 ] ) . in the newtonian cosmology",
    "the friedmann equations read    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a constant of integration which plays the role of the energy of the expanding system . in this newtonian treatment",
    "the pressure is not dynamically relevant for the homogeneous and isotropic background . with newtonian cosmology",
    "it is not possible to model a radiation dominated phase or even to study a late time dark energy dominated epoch .",
    "this approach is restricted to a description of an einstein - de sitter universe which is a model dominated by pressureless matter .    a simple way to include the effects of the pressure and , at the same time ,",
    "keep the simplicity of the newtonian physics is to use the neo - newtonian ( or pseudo - newtonian ) equations developed during the 1950s by mccrea @xcite and by harrison in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "later , during the 1990s , an important analysis concerning the perturbative behavior of harrison s neo - newtonian equations helped to set the final form for the system of equations in this approach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "standard cosmology is based on the notion of perfect fluids and the effective pressure of the fluid is interpreted as its equilibrium ( kinetic ) pressure .",
    "however , since the universe is made of real components rather than ideal ones , one can go a step further including dissipative mechanisms in the above approach . in a homogeneous and isotropic background ,",
    "i.e.  if the cosmological principle holds , directional dissipative processes ( shear and heat conduction ) can not play a decisive role in the cosmic dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "the expansion can induce a small deviation from equilibrium in the form of a bulk viscosity .",
    "our cosmological model is very similar to the standard @xmath0cdm scenario .",
    "we assume a flat background expansion of a universe consisting of baryons , radiation , a cosmological constant and viscous cold dark matter ( vcdm ) . attributing a viscosity to cold dark matter represents the only modification compared with the @xmath0cdm model . as in the standard case ,",
    "the components are assumed to obey separately the energy conservation laws @xmath22 where the subscripts @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 denote baryons , radiation , viscous dark matter and cosmological constant , respectively .",

    "note that different from the newtonian description based on ( [ continuity1 ] ) , ( [ euler1 ] ) and ( [ poisson1 ] ) , the neo - newtonian approach incorporates the pressure contributions of the different components already at the background level .",
    "it would not have been possible , e.g. , to include a radiation component with @xmath28 into the traditional newtonian description .",

    "we emphasize again that in the traditional newtonian cosmology ( superscript @xmath35 ) the pressure is not relevant for the homogeneous and isotropic background and we have @xmath36 .",
    "however , the neo - newtonian and the relativistic theories take into account the dynamical effects of the pressure for the background and the evolution of the viscous dark - matter density will obey the conservation equation ( [ cont ] ) .    to study bulk viscous phenomena we decompose the pressure @xmath34 according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the kinetic ( adiabatic ) pressure and",
    "@xmath39 is the bulk viscous ( non - adiabatic ) one .",
    "the form of @xmath39 is determined by eckart s theory of dissipative processes @xcite .",
    "our goal in this work is to understand what is the appropriate newtonian approximation for the study of bulk viscous effects until the onset of non - linear structure formation .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that the viscous dark - matter fluid has a vanishing kinetic pressure @xmath40 .",
    "then its only pressure contribution is a ( small ) viscous pressure @xmath41 .",
    "one reason for this assumption is that the effects of a small adiabatic pressure give rise to the famous jeans instability criterion , i.e. the formation of structure is prevented below the so - called jeans scale .",
    "in contrast to the adiabatic pressure , the effect of bulk pressure can damp density fluctuations .",
    "we recall that we regard the bulk viscous pressure as an effective description of deviations from the standard pressureless cdm fluid .",
    "note that in kinetic gas theory with standard interactions a viscous pressure is a correction to the adiabatic pressure .    in the present situation",

    "one can find in the literature approaches where @xmath54 implying that the viscosity depends indirectly on the density of the other components .",
    "in this case , it is mandatory to assume a coupling between the components violating the assumption of separated energy conservation .    assuming ( [ xi ] ) , the energy - conservation equation for the viscous dark matter , in terms of the redshift @xmath55 , is written as @xmath56^{1/2}=0 , \\label{model2}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 as initial condition we set @xmath58 @xcite .",

    "cosmic structures are formed under gravitational agglomeration of dark matter halos and the subsequent accretion of baryons during the matter dominated epoch .",
    "the galaxy clustering patterns , observed by large - scale surveys , can be directly compared to theoretical predictions by using either n - body or hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the latter uses fluid dynamics , i.e. continuity and euler equations coupled to the poisson equation .    during the radiation dominated epoch the hubble drag stagnates such structures .",
    "when the background becomes matter dominated ( for the concordance model this occurs at @xmath62 ) , the fractional density perturbations @xmath63 , which subsequently evolve into the standard cdm halos , start to grow linearly with the scale factor , @xmath64 .",
    "the smallest scales become nonlinear first , decoupling from the hubble flow .",
    "the perturbations on the remaining sub - horizon scales which are still in the linear regime continue to grow until dark energy accelerates the background expansion at late times causing a a suppression of the growth of @xmath63 . for pressureless cdm",
    "this picture is achieved in both newtonian and relativistic formulations but for the case of vcdm we could expect that the dissipation leads to an extra suppression mechanism .    in the next subsections",
    "we derive the equations needed in order to study the evolution of sub - horizon viscous dark matter halos .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the density contrast within the newtonian , neo - newtonian and general relativistic cases .      in order to understand the structure formation it is necessary to apply cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "we briefly describe the procedure .",
    "firstly , we decompose eqs .",

    "it is also necessary to replace the euler coordinates by the lagrangian ones ( in lagrangian coordinates @xmath71 ) .",
    "note that this treatment is valid for any effective pressure @xmath9 .",

    "note that @xmath44 appears inside the gradient operator in equation ( [ ns1 ] ) .",
    "since the background viscosity is only time - dependent ( @xmath76 ) one often writes @xmath77 instead of the last term of ( [ ns1 ] ) .",
    "however , at linear order , perturbations of @xmath44 generally depend on the position , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "perturbing the pressure @xmath9 given by ( [ eckart ] ) , we find @xmath79 we have used the first - order eq .",

    "we derived the equations of motion for linear scalar perturbations for the vcdm fluid on sub - horizon scales for the newtonian , neo - newtonian and relativistic descriptions .",
    "we then focused on the formation of dark matter halos for the dwarf galaxy and galaxy clusters scales .",
    "the standard cdm growth is proportional to the scale factor @xmath153 during the matter dominated epoch . at late times and small scales ,",
    "dark energy causes only a small attenuation of the growth of structure . for the @xmath90cdm scenario ,",
    "we observe a strong growth suppression even for tiny values of the viscosity parameter @xmath59 , consistent with the findings in @xcite .",
    "the key result of this work is that the dissipative , small - scale relativistic dynamics is fully described by the neo - newtonian theory for all values of the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath51 . only in the exceptional case of a constant coefficient of bulk viscosity ( @xmath137 )",
    "all three approaches agree and the usual newtonian method applies .",
    "however , the range of validity of our results is limited only to very small values of the dark matter equation of state parameter .",
    "indeed , this is the most interesting case because it is the situation where structures form .",
    "thus , apart from this case , newtonian perturbation theory can not be used to provide the correct growth of viscous cdm structures .",
    "consequently , a neo - newtonian approach must be used when issues like the cuspy - core problem or the missing satellite problem are addressed in numerical fluid simulations with modified cdm properties .",
