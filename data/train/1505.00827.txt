    "<S> the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of pristine , defective and oxidized monolayer tis@xmath0 are investigated using first - principles calculations in the framework of density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> we found that a single layer of tis@xmath0 is a direct band gap semiconductor and the bonding nature of the crystal is fundamentally different from other transition metal chalcogenides . </S>",
    "<S> the negatively charged surfaces of single layer tis@xmath0 makes this crystal a promising material for lubrication applications . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energies of possible vacancies , i.e. s , ti , tis and double s , are investigated via total energy optimization calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the formation of a single s vacancy was the most likely one among the considered vacancy types . while a single s vacancy results in a nonmagnetic , semiconducting character with an enhanced band gap , other vacancy types induce metallic behavior with spin polarization of @xmath1 @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the reactivity of pristine and defective tis@xmath0 crystals against oxidation was investigated using conjugate gradient calculations where we considered the interaction with atomic o , o@xmath3 and o@xmath0 . while o@xmath3 has the lowest binding energy with @xmath4 ev , o@xmath0 forms strong bonds stable even at moderate temperatures . the strong interaction ( @xmath5 ev ) between atomic o and tis@xmath0 results in dissociative adsorption of some o - containing molecules . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the presence of s - vacancies enhances the reactivity of the surface with atomic o whereas , it had a negative effect on the reactivity with o@xmath3 and o@xmath0 molecules . </S>"
