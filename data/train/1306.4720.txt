    "shapes of growing objects have fascinated humans from the dawn of time .",
    "the understanding of these shapes is crucial for numerous technological applications .",
    "microscopic processes underlying growth phenomena are usually stochastic , with rules depending on the detailed local structure of the interface , so it is not surprising that even the simplest growth rules lead to interfaces which are seemingly impossible to describe theoretically . an important relatively recent theoretical insight is the realization that microscopic details often play a secondary role .",
    "this has led to the devising of _ continuum _ descriptions for fluctuations of growing interfaces .",
    "the most well - known such framework was initiated by kardar , parisi , and zhang ( kpz ) who proposed a continuum theory based on a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation @xcite , arguably the simplest equation accounting for the crucial growth ingredients  nonlinearity , stochasticity , irreversibility , and locality .",
    "the kpz equation provides a unifying framework for probing fluctuations in a large class of growing interfaces",
    ". a comprehensive description of fluctuations of one - dimensional growing interfaces has subsequently emerged ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and a key recent breakthrough is a solution of the 1 + 1 dimensional kpz equation @xcite .",
    "crystal growth typically occurs in three dimensions , however .",
    "microscopic growth models and continuum theories are straightforward to formulate in arbitrary dimension , yet in 2 + 1 dimensions the kpz equation remains inaccessible to current analytical approaches",
    ". therefore fluctuations of two - dimensional growing interfaces are still poorly understood .",
    "fluctuations characterize the local structure of the interfaces , but they tell nothing about the overall shape of an interface , more precisely the shape on the scale greatly exceeding length scales associated with fluctuations . such overall shapes , known as limiting shapes , usually become clearly identifiable in the long - time limit . in the simplest case when growth begins from a flat substrate ,",
    "the limiting shape is trivial  the interface remains on average flat , and only speed and fluctuations matter . in most applications the interfaces are curved .",
    "curved limiting shapes have been analytically determined only in a few cases .",
    "for instance , the limiting shape is still unknown for the two - dimensional eden - richardson growth model , although it has been proved that the limiting shape exists and that it is roughly but not exactly circular @xcite ; in contrast , fluctuations of the interface of eden clusters are understood ( and belong to the 1 + 1 dimensional kpz universality class ) .",
    "there are almost no analytical results for the limiting shapes of curved two - dimensional growing interfaces .",
    "all known tractable examples correspond to _ anisotropic _ growth in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the term anisotropic means that the first two dimensions , the transversal directions along the interface , arise in a greatly distinct manner .",
    "an anisotropic 2 + 1 dimensional growth model can usually be reformulated as a collection of identical solvable 1 + 1 dimensional growth models with some non - intersecting condition between neighboring interfaces .",
    "one solvable anisotropic growth model is the 2 + 1 dimensional gates - westcott model @xcite which mimics vicinal growing surfaces ; this model has been solved by a free - fermion mapping  @xcite .",
    "average interface profiles are also known for two other anisotropic 2 + 1 dimensional growth models  @xcite . in the most basic isotropic growth models limiting shapes",
    "are not known .",
    "one of the first non - trivial limiting shapes was found in the context of the corner growth model  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "one starts with an infinite empty corner , namely with a quadrant on the square lattice ; the growth occurs by deposition of @xmath0 squares into available inner corners .",
    "the limiting shape consists of two ballistically receding half - lines constituting the original boundary which are connected by a piece of parabola @xmath1 this two - dimensional corner growth model has also played a crucial role in the analytical description of the statistics associated with 1 + 1 dimensional kpz growth  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the natural generalization of the corner growth process to three dimensions , where the growth occurs inside an octant , and to higher dimensions .",
    "we also study the behavior of integral characteristics , e.g. the volume of the crystal ( we look at the average and the standard deviation ) , and the total numbers of inner and outer corners on the interface .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the growth process is defined in sect .",
    "[ mod ] where we also recall known two - dimensional results . in sect .",
    "[ 3d ] we investigate the three - dimensional case , namely we consider crystal growth on the cubic grid inside the octant .",
    "we propose an evolution equation describing the asymptotic evolution of the interface . in sect .",
    "[ analysis ] we interpret this equation as the hamilton - jacobi equation , and we use an equivalent description based on the canonical hamilton equations to derive the solution .",
    "generalizations to higher dimensions are discussed in sect .",
    "[ higher ] .",
    "the behavior of the average volume of the crystal ( both the leading asymptotic and the sub - leading correction ) and volume fluctuations are investigated in sect .  [ volume ] .",
    "the growth of the total numbers of inner and outer corners is analyzed in sect .",
    "[ corners ] . in sect .",
    "[ concl ] we summarize what we understand , emphasize the remaining challenges , and discuss open problems .",
    "consider an infinite corner , viz . a positive octant in the cubic lattice , which is initially empty .",
    "the growth process begins at time @xmath2 and proceeds by depositing elementary @xmath3 cubes into available inner corners .",
    "we set the deposition rate to unity without loss of generality .",
    "initially there is one inner corner available , so the smallest non - empty crystal is unique . after this first deposition event , there are three available inner corners that can accommodate the next cube , so the uniqueness is lost . for the crystal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illust_3d ] there are 6 places to insert a new cube .",
    "the above dynamics can be defined in arbitrary spatial dimension .",
    "the models are of course lattice models ; more specifically they are defined on hyper - cubic lattices .",
    "( one can consider other lattices , but then one should choose a different infinite initially empty region depending on lattice structure . )",
    "the interpretation is a matter of taste : rather than talking about crystal growth through the deposition of cubes into inner corners , we can think about crystal melting through the desorption of cubes from outer corners of an initially fully filled octant .",
    "these two processes are dual . a typical realization of the melting process is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal_3d ] .",
    "the interface is stochastic , yet as the crystal grows ( or equivalently as the melted volume increases ) , the interface becomes smoother and ultimately approaches a deterministic limiting shape .",
    "direction.,scaledwidth=37.5% ]    the two - dimensional corner growth process can be understood by a mapping onto the one - dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) , that is a collection of particles undergoing a biased random walk under the constraint that there is at most one particle per site  @xcite .",
    "( this mapping is also helpful in computing fluctuations of the interface  @xcite . )",
    "the representation in terms of the tasep becomes evident after one rotates the corner counter - clockwise by an angle of @xmath4 around the origin and then projects the interface onto the one - dimensional lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ csp ] ) in such a way that bonds of the interface are identified with sites on the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we now put a particle on a site ( leave a site empty ) if the corresponding segment on the interface goes along the co - diagonal ( diagonal ) . each site on the one - dimensional lattice is occupied by at most one particle , the particles hop to the right with unit rate , and the lattice gas is clearly identical to the tasep .",
    "the average density @xmath5 evolves according to the ( inviscid ) burgers equation @xmath6}{\\partial z } = 0\\,.\\ ] ] solving this burgers equation and expressing the limiting shape through the density @xcite one arrives at a remarkably simple parabolic limiting shape .     and the corresponding particle configuration",
    ". a deposition event is shown , and the corresponding hop of a particle to a neighboring vacant site is highlighted . ]    in three dimensions , the corner growth model can be mapped onto an infinite set of coupled taseps in the plane , also known as the ` zigzag model ' @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no exact solutions are known for such planar interacting particle processes .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions also seems exceedingly difficult .",
    "we therefore choose a different strategy ; namely , we try to directly write an evolution equation for the limiting shape without using intermediate mappings onto a particle process .    in two dimensions ,",
    "this program can be fulfilled , viz . the limiting shape @xmath7 satisfies the evolution equation  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "is indeed given by .",
    "our task is to generalize eq .   to three and higher dimensions .",
    "we havent derived a generalization eq .   to three dimensions . in such a situation",
    ", one can proceed in a less systematic manner by guessing an evolution equation .",
    "the criteria are the simplicity and the validity of the basic symmetry properties .",
    "more precisely , we seek an evolution equation for @xmath10 that    1 .   reduces to the proper analogs of eq .   on the boundaries @xmath11 and @xmath12 , viz .",
    "@xmath13 on the first boundary and @xmath14 on the second .",
    "2 .   is invariant in form under the @xmath15 and @xmath16 coordinate exchanges .",
    "needless to say , we anticipate that the governing equation is a first - order partial differential equation ( pde ) of the form @xmath17 similar to the two - dimensional case .",
    "the simplest guess for the right - hand side is the product of terms similar to those appearing in eq .  :",
    "@xmath18 on the boundaries @xmath11 and @xmath12 we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and hence reduces to @xmath13 and @xmath14 on these boundaries . yet eq .   does not possess the required invariance under the exchange of variables .",
    "we eventually found an equation satisfying the above criteria .",
    "this equation has a very unusual form @xmath21.\\ ] ] our search was facilitated by numerical experiments in which we studied the movement of various planes .",
    "( more precisely , we initially investigated a generalized version of the hypercube stacking model of forrest and tang @xcite which allows for tuning the slopes @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the flat interface . ) any plane moves ( on average ) with a constant speed .",
    "we thus measure the speed and compare it with the prediction of eq .  .",
    "for the plane @xmath24 ( this is the plane orthogonal to the ( 1,1,1 ) direction ) we found @xmath25 which is an excellent agreement with the prediction @xmath26 implied by .",
    "we looked at several other planes , e.g. for the plane @xmath27 the measured velocity is again within @xmath28 of the prediction @xmath29 implied by .",
    "consider a one - parameter family of evolution equations @xmath30 this family contains eqs .   and as special cases .",
    "the invariance under the exchange of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is manifest .",
    "further , equation reduces to @xmath33 [ respectively to @xmath34 when @xmath11 [ respectively @xmath12 ] .",
    "hence we only need to test the invariance under the exchange of @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "we use standard relations between the derivatives @xmath37 by inserting into we arrive at @xmath38 on the other hand , the invariance under the exchange of @xmath31 and @xmath36 requires that we should obtain @xmath39 comparing these two equations we conclude that the only member of the family of equations that satisfies the invariance requirements corresponds to @xmath40 , which is precisely the evolution equation . in particular , eq .  , which corresponds to @xmath41 , is _ not _ invariant under the exchange of @xmath31 and @xmath36 .    instead of a one - parameter family of evolutionary equations",
    "let us now analyze an infinite - parameter family of evolutionary equations @xmath42.\\ ] ] the invariance under @xmath15 exchange leads to @xmath43 this is valid for arbitrary @xmath44 only when @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "we can further generalize the class of equations , namely by replacing the term in the square brackets in with an arbitrary laurent series @xmath48 terms with @xmath49 can not be present , however , since on the boundaries @xmath11 and @xmath12 we must recover @xmath33 and @xmath50 ; this requirement additionally fixes the parameter @xmath51 and hence we are back to .",
    "therefore eq .   is the only appropriate evolution equation among the family of equations .",
    "the evolution equation is not a unique evolution equation satisfying the necessary requirements .",
    "for instance , we have found another equation @xmath52\\ ] ] that obeys all necessary conditions .",
    "equation looks more complicated than , although it can be re - written in a very simple ( even if a bit unusual ) form if we replace derivatives by their reciprocal values : @xmath53 this equation admits a very simple analytical solution which is a straightforward generalization of the solution in the two - dimensional setting : @xmath54 this is verified by a direct substitution .",
    "the analytical solution of is different from as we shall see .",
    "a comparison of predictions of and is strongly in favor of eq .  .",
    "for instance , consider the volume of the crystal . for the surface corresponding to the evolution equation , the volume is @xmath55 .",
    "it is much more difficult to compute the volume corresponding to the evolution equation .",
    "an exact solution to eq .",
    "is rather cumbersome ; namely it is parametric , so one must compute an unwieldy integral .",
    "the answer is @xmath56 the amplitude substantially exceeds @xmath57 corresponding to the interface ; numerically @xmath58 .",
    "further , let us look at the intersection of the interface and the diagonal [ in the @xmath59 direction ]",
    ". one can numerically determine this quantity with a good precision .",
    "analytically , this point corresponds to @xmath60    for the surface , we have @xmath61 , while @xmath62 , on the interface predicted by eq .  .",
    "interestingly , we can extract @xmath62 without knowing the limiting shape .",
    "the high symmetry of the diagonal implies that @xmath63 on the diagonal . indeed",
    ", all the derivatives in must be equal due to symmetry . to establish the numerical value we use @xmath64 together with the identity @xmath65 to conclude that @xmath66 from which ( the derivatives are obviously negative ) we arrive at .    plugging into",
    "we find that @xmath26 on the diagonal .",
    "projecting the vector @xmath67 onto the diagonal @xmath59 direction we find that the distance of the diagonal point on the interface from the origin is equal to @xmath68 . to determine @xmath69 we need to project again ; this yields @xmath70 .",
    "numerically @xmath71 .",
    "this result is close to the theoretical prediction @xmath72 and clearly differs from @xmath73 that characterizes the interface .    in principle",
    ", one can use equations and as building blocks to obtain one - parameter families of equations satisfying the necessary requirements .",
    "two such families are obtained by an additive and a multiplicative combination of and .",

    "the corner interface growth is presumably described by a simple equation that does not contain an anomalously small mixing parameter .",
    "this in conjunction with our numerical results suggest that eq .   describes corner interface evolution ; at the very least , the true evolution equation is not an ugly deformation like or with a very small mixing parameter .",
    "using equations and separately , one can construct a few more families of invariant equations .",
    "one such one - parameter series family @xmath79 \\frac{(1-z_x - z_y)^n}{1+(-z_x)^n+(-z_y)^n}\\ ] ] extends the presumably correct equation corresponding to @xmath80 to arbitrary real @xmath81 .",
    "setting @xmath82 would match the observed value of @xmath77 ; for @xmath83 , one gets @xmath84 .",

    "we can even construct multi - parameter families of evolution equations by simply multiplying any number of additional factors of the form @xmath88 onto the right - hand side of   or  , where each @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is a free parameter .",
    "each such factor strictly preserves the invariance properties of the evolution equation . in principle",
    ", we could obtain nearly perfect theoretical agreement over the entire simulated interface profile by suitably tuning parameters in these equations .",
    "the trade - off is that the growth equations are becoming quite unsightly .",
    "that our numerical simulations persistently show such minute discrepancies from a beautiful analytical description   is puzzling @xcite .",
    "even for careful simulations of the hypercube stacking model @xcite , tiny ( yet apparently significant ) inconsistencies between our simple equation   and simulation data persist . theoretically explaining the precise source of these discrepancies is an intriguing open question .      for @xmath92 dimensional corner growth , we saved the simulated interface profile at times @xmath93 with @xmath94 , giving a total of ten data points .",
    "we ran forty independent realizations of the growth process until at least time @xmath95 .",
    "we then continued running twenty of those realizations until at least time @xmath96 , and we ran ten of those realizations all the way to @xmath97 .",
    "each of our measurements of a quantity at time @xmath98 is therefore an ensemble average .",
    "the error bar for a measurement is computed as the standard error of the measured quantity over all forty , twenty , or ten realizations that were run for at least that long .",
    "it is possible that discrepancies between our simulation results and the predictions that follow from eq .",
    "can be attributed to rather slow convergence to the asymptotic state .",
    "flat and curved interface geometries have been proven to have differing fluctuation statistics in @xmath99 dimensions @xcite , and we are operating in the much - less - understood @xmath92 dimensional setting .",
    "a similarly slow convergence to asymptotic behavior occurs in various well - understood one - dimensional growth models ( see e.g. refs .",
    "for example , for 1 + 1 dimensional corner growth , the intersection of the interface with the @xmath100 direction evolves according to  @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a stationary random variable with @xmath103 .",
    "thus averaging over many realizations gives an effective velocity @xmath104 .",
    "for growth inside a three - dimensional corner , we therefore anticipate that @xmath105 , with a certain ( theoretically unknown ) exponent @xmath106 .",
    "very extensive simulations for flat interfaces in 2 + 1 dimensions indicate that @xmath106 is close to 0.77  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , extrapolation from our simulations for @xmath107 suggests that @xmath108 .",
    "this difference in exponent estimates suggests that @xmath97 is still outside the long - time regime for growth inside a three - dimensional corner .",
    "it has proved difficult to obtain consistent estimates of the kpz scaling exponents from simulations even in the simpler case of growing flat interfaces in @xmath92 dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this slow approach to the asymptotic behavior can be the source of the discrepancy between our simulation results and the theoretical prediction for the interface profile .     versus @xmath109 , along the diagonal @xmath110 at different times.,scaledwidth=37.5% ]    .",

    "still , our estimates for the lowest - order correction exponent for @xmath226 [ where we get @xmath227 while gives @xmath228 and the exponent for @xmath229 [ where we get @xmath230 while predicts the exponent @xmath231 are consistent with prior numerical estimates @xcite of the exponent @xmath36 .",
    "in our lattice growth problem , the continuum limiting shape , and even fluctuations of the interface , are just a few key properties . even if we limit our concern to global characteristics of the interface , we can ask about the growth laws for the total number @xmath232 of inner corners and for the total number @xmath233 of outer corners . using the definition of the growth dynamics",
    "we conclude that @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the average volume of the growing crystal .",
    "equation then tells us that @xmath236    the dynamics says nothing about the average total number of outer corners . in two dimensions",

    "[ fig : illust_3d ] .",
    "we anticipated that generally @xmath243 , and that the average numbers of corners of each kind exhibit the same leading growth .",
    "intriguingly , our simulation results show that the average total number of outer corners exhibits a faster asymptotic growth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : out_in ] ) .",
    "numerically , the leading asymptotic behaviors are    @xmath244    our numerical estimate for the amplitude @xmath245 is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction according to which @xmath246 .     0.1 in     how can the unexpected result @xmath247 be reconciled with the concave curvature of the corner interface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_3d ] ) ? to aid in understanding , consider fig .",
    "[ fig : corners ] , which shows a flat planar interface , with slopes @xmath24 in an average sense , that extends to infinity in all directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corners ]  ( top ) , the number of inner corners on the interface exactly equals the number of outer corners .",
    "since this interface has no average curvature , the equality between inner and outer corners is not so surprising .",
    "now consider the interface in fig .",
    "[ fig : corners ]  ( bottom ) after making a small dimple at each outer corner in the top image .",
    "the ratio of outer corners to inner corners is now @xmath248 , yet the interface macroscopically still has no curvature !",
    "one sees that the statistics of inner and outer corners can not be directly inferred from the global shape of an interface .",
    "we have presented a minimalist model for studying crystal growth in three dimensions .",
    "elemental cubes are deposited stochastically into an initially empty octant , namely into the inner corners of the growing interface . at late times",
    "when fluctuations become small relative to the typical size of the interface , the interface becomes progressively more deterministic .",
    "we have proposed a hyperbolic partial differential equation describing this dominant deterministic limiting shape .",
    "this equation has passed through the necessary consistency checks ( it has the required symmetry properties , and it reduces to correct evolution equations on the boundaries of the octant ) .",
    "we have solved the evolution equation using the hamilton - jacobi technique and we have found a very good agreement between analytical results and numerical simulations of the growth process .",
    "we have also analyzed fluctuations of integral characteristics , e.g. we have expressed the sub - leading correction to the volume of the crystal and the variance of the volume through the kpz exponents . even in @xmath99 dimensions ,",
    "the only case for which these exponents are known , our results are incomplete as we havent computed the amplitudes .",
    "this technically challenging problem may be within the reach of analytical techniques which have been developed in studies of interfaces in @xmath99 dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; perhaps even large deviations could be analytically extracted .",
    "overall , we are faced with a dilemma : we havent derived eq .  ,",
    "and on the numerical side there is a small ( less than @xmath28 in the growth velocity ) but persistent discrepancy between the analytical solution of eq .   and simulation results .",
    "one possible explanation is that for the @xmath92 dimensional kpz growth the convergence can be notoriously slow @xcite .",
    "we have shown that one can construct evolution equations passing the consistency checks which provide a better agreement with observed value of the growth velocity .",
    "such equations are ugly , and it seems that if an equation has a right - hand side which is a rational function of the spatial derivatives @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the only elegant one which is in a very close proximity with simulations is eq .  . given the utmost simplicity of the rules of our minimalist growth model , it would be very odd to end up with an ugly equation for the limiting shape .",
    "perhaps the only possible way to overcome the above ( admittedly imprecise ) arguments is if the true evolution equation has a right - hand side which is a transcendental function of the spatial derivatives @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( which reduces to simple rational functions on the boundaries of the octant , i.e. when @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) .",
    "the striking simplicity and accuracy of our conjectural growth equation beautifully match the simplicity of the model under study , which certainly warrants further investigation .",
    "we hope that our analytical results will aid in studies of @xmath92 dimensional kpz growth . relatively little",
    "is known about temporal correlations in height fluctuations in these growth models .",
    "some recent studies on @xmath99 dimensional kpz growth have revealed slow temporal de - correlation along the characteristic directions of interface growth . in the polynuclear growth model in @xmath99 dimensions ,",
    "temporal correlations in height fluctuations have been proven to decay on a time scale @xmath249 for generic curves in the space - time . however , along the characteristic directions , temporal correlations decay on a time that scales as @xmath204 , i.e. much more slowly @xcite . in @xmath92 dimensions ,",
    "presumably a similar slow de - correlation phenomenon is present , although to our knowledge this has not been tested @xcite .",
    "we now have predictions for the characteristic curves of @xmath250 corner growth , and our equations may help facilitate numerical experiments on time - dependent interface fluctuation statistics .",
    "we have offered novel predictions for the sub - leading correction to the average volume and for the growth in variance of the volume of a growing crystal in three and higher dimensions .",
    "these results should hold generically for all higher - dimensional models that belong to the strong - coupling kpz universality class . indeed",
    ", we hope that studies of integral properties of the interface such as the volume or the numbers of inner and outer corners may deliver valuable new insights .",
    "open problems abound in the field of interface shapes and statistics .",
    "a host of problems arises if we reformulate our original problem in terms of the spin - flip dynamics @xcite .",
    "consider an ising ferromagnet with nearest - neighbor interactions endowed with zero - temperature spin - flip dynamics . if we start with a minority phase occupying the octant , the evolution is exactly the same as in our crystal growth process if we additionally postulate that our ferromagnet is in a magnetic field which favors the majority phase .",
    "what happens if in addition to the nearest - neighbor interactions we take into account next - nearest - neighbor interactions , or even longer range interactions ?",
    "we have recently addressed this problem @xcite in two dimensions : we have derived evolution equations generalizing eq .   and found corresponding limiting shapes .",
    "there is an infinite series of such equations varying with the range of interactions .",
    "needless to say , nothing is known in three dimensions .",
    "even more challenging is to consider the problem without any magnetic field . in our original language",
    ", this is equivalent to allowing desorption of elemental cubes from outer corners on the interface .",
    "the desorption proceeds with the same rate as deposition .",
    "the interface grows much more slowly than in the pure deposition case , namely the growth is diffusive ( that is , the linear size of the interface scales as @xmath251 ) .",
    "quantitative results are known only in two dimensions where the exact evolution equation is known and solvable @xcite . in the general case , an evolution equation for unbiased dynamics",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , yet this equation appears analytically intractable .",
    "even numerically this problem has not yet been studied .",
    "finally , we mention equilibrium crystals ( also known as young diagrams ) of a fixed volume inside a corner .",
    "all crystals with the same volume are equiprobable .",
    "a surface of a typical crystal with large volume is close to a limiting shape which has been established both in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for other three - dimensional versions ) . in greater than three spatial dimensions ,",
    "finding the equilibrium limiting shape is a tantalizing mathematical problem .",
    "one suspects a connection between equilibrium limiting shapes and the limiting shapes arising in the growth problems ( with and without a magnetic field ) , or perhaps a connection between equations which determine these limiting shapes .",
    "one may try to guess equilibrium limiting shapes using the same tricks as before ( symmetry constraints and matching to low - dimensional equilibrium limiting shapes in conjunction with a small number of well - chosen numerical clues ) .",
