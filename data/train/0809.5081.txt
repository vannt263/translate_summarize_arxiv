    "most stars are born in ob associations ( blaauw 1964 ; lada & lada 2003 ) , in the vicinity of hot massive stars spawned only from giant molecular clouds .",
    "the effects of feedback from these massive stars can not be studied in nearby quiescent regions of star formation .        the carina nebula ( fig .",
    "[ fig : big ] ; ngc  3372 ) is the southern hemisphere s largest and highest surface brightness nebula  some central parts of the nebula are even brighter than the orion nebula .",
    "it provides an ideal laboratory in which to study ongoing star formation in the vicinity of some of the most massive stars known , including our galaxy s most luminous known star , @xmath0 carinae .",
    "carina s star clusters are not as densely packed as those of 30  dor in the lmc ( massey & hunter 1998 ) , or objects in our own galaxy like the arches cluster near the galactic center ( najarro et al .",

    "1987 ) . however , these other regions are too distant for detailed studies of small - scale phenomena like irradiated protoplanetary disks and jets , and their study is hampered by considerably more extinction . the low extinction toward carina combined with its proximity and rich nebular content",
    "provide a worthwhile trade - off .    for the most massive stars , lifetimes of @xmath13 myr before they explode as supernovae ( sne ) are comparable to the time it takes to clear away their surrounding large - scale distribution of molecular material .",
    "consequently , we already have a situation in carina where the most massive members like @xmath0  car are approaching their imminent demise while new stars are being born from dense molecular gas only 520 pc away . in the next 12 myr",
    ", there will be several energetic sne in carina .",
    "these will carve out an even larger cavity in the ism and form a giant superbubble in the galactic plane , and may pollute protoplanetary disks with nuclear - processed ejecta . in the mean time",
    ", studying this rich region provides a snapshot of a young proto - superbubble ( smith et al .",
    "2000 ) energized only by uv radiation and stellar winds , just before the disruptive sn - dominated phase .",
    "carinae and its surrounding nebulosity ( n.  smith / nasa).,scaledwidth=95.0% ]     carinae ( from frew 2004).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      from before the time of herschel up to the present , most observational effort in the carina nebula had focussed on the variable star @xmath0 carinae ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eta1 ] ) and its immediate surroundings .",
    "the unusual variability of @xmath0  car was noted as early as the 17th century by halley , when it was reputed to vary between 4th and 2nd magnitude .",
    "later , in the early and mid 19th century , it was observed by john herschel ( 1847 ) as it brightened significantly to become the second brightest star in the sky .",
    "it then faded from view by the 1870s .",
    "frew ( 2004 ) gives a careful and detailed account of the historical light curve ( fig .",

    "the star ejected more than 10  @xmath2 with almost 10@xmath3 erg of kinetic energy ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) , which has since expanded to form the so - called `` homunculus '' nebula seen today in _ hst _ images like the one in figure  [ fig : eta1 ] .",
    "after more than 160 years and intensive study at all wavelengths , the underlying cause of this so - called `` great eruption '' is still the most enduring mystery associated with @xmath0  car . additionally , much current work centers around the 5.5-yr periodic variability that is likely the product of @xmath0 carinae being an eccentric binary system ( e.g. , damineli et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "our focus here is on star formation in the surrounding giant h  ii region , so we do not aim to review or summarize the vast and complicated literature concerning @xmath0 carinae and its ejecta ( see davidson & humphreys 1997 ; although much has been added to our understanding in the subsequent decade making that review outdated in some respects ) .",
    "however , the wild variability of @xmath0  car , its extreme nature , and its imminent demise are relevant for nebular structures in the region . from the point of view of understanding star formation in the region ,",
    "two important facts are most worth remembering :    \\(1 ) although @xmath0 carinae is probably the most massive and luminous star known in the milky way , _ at the current time it contributes essentially nothing to the radiative energy budget of the surrounding region_. this strange twist arises because @xmath0 carinae is currently surrounded by a nearly opaque dust shell ejected 160 years ago , which absorbs nearly all of the star s uv and visual luminosity .",
    "that luminosity is then re - radiated in the thermal ir , and it escapes from the nebula , exerting little influence on the surrounding gas in the star - forming complex .",
    "\\(2 ) however , before 1843 ( for about 3 myr prior ) , @xmath0  carinae had a tremendous influence on the uv energy budget of the entire region .",
    "its uv luminosity dominated the ionization of the main cavity and it sculpted many of the most prominent elephant trunks in the region .",
    "when the giant eruption ended about 150 years ago and @xmath0 car faded due to dust obscuration , the uv luminosity of the region dropped by 20% ( smith 2006a ) and the remaining o stars that are scattered throughout the region now dominate the ionization .",
    "this change , which arises because of @xmath0 car s precarious instability and its evolved state , is unique among galactic h  ii regions .",
    "carinae s 19th century outburst .",
    "right : a modern color photograph of the keyhole made by david malin.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]      the famous `` keyhole '' nebula at the heart of the greater carina nebula also has a rich history , aided by its location immediately adjacent to @xmath0 carinae , as well as its extremely high surface brightness .",
    "the physical origin of the keyhole shape is still not understood ( although see smith 2002b ) .",
    "while the old - fashioned keyhole shape is easily recognized in herschel s drawing , more creativity is required to identify this structure in modern photographs ( see comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : herschel ] ) .",
    "the most dramatic difference is in the lower part of the keyhole , where much of the diffuse emission is brighter in herschel s drawing .",
    "this has caused some consternation to observers ( e.g. , bok 1932 ) , making some suspect that herschel may have had an over - active imagination .",
    "in fact , it is likely that herschel s drawing was largely correct , and that the appearance of the nebula has actually changed with time .",
    "herschel s drawing in figure  [ fig : herschel ] was made around 1840 , during the great eruption of @xmath0  car , before the star was obscured by its dusty nebula .",
    "thus , at that time the keyhole was illuminated by a much brighter star than is seen today , and the reflection nebulosity around the keyhole could have differed in appearance .",
    "we now know from both historical and modern data that the reflected spectrum of @xmath0  car is seen in the keyhole ( walborn & liller 1977 ; lopez & meaburn 1986 ) , confirming that it is at the same distance as @xmath0  car .",
    "given that the larger carina nebula is more than 150 light years across , one might wonder if light echoes from the great eruption can still be seen in archival images .    as for the diffuse emission from the larger carina nebula",
    ", herschel did have a few choice words to describe it : `` it would be manifestly impossible by verbal description to give any just idea of the capricious forms and irregular gradations of light affected by the different branches and appendages of this nebula . ''",
    "the rich , complex structure that herschel was referring to is associated with the many dust pillars and dark globules , the likes of which are not seen in the orion nebula .",
    "perhaps this is an early testament to feedback from the extreme stellar population in carina , providing us with a snapshot of a molecular cloud getting shredded by its progeny .    in the 20th century , observers began to take a broader view of carina , realizing that it spanned several degrees of the sky . in this review ,",
    "we are concerned with star formation across the full extent of the carina nebula .",
    "the nomenclature for this region is interchanged loosely , being referred to variously as ngc  3372 , the `` carina nebula '' , the `` great carina nebula '' , the `` keyhole nebula '' , the `` eta carinae nebula '' , or ( incorrectly ) as simply `` eta carinae '' .",
    "we reserve `` eta carinae '' for discussions of the massive star itself , the `` homunculus '' nebula ( gaviola 1950 ) , plus surrounding ejecta nebulosity within about 1  ( e.g.  smith et al .",
    "we use the name `` keyhole nebula '' to refer to the structures in figure  [ fig : herschel ] , within about 10  of @xmath0 car , while we use the term `` carina nebula '' to refer to the larger giant h  ii region spanning several square degrees ( fig .",
    "[ fig : big ] ) , of which @xmath0 car and the keyhole are only a small component at the center .",
    "the first modern interference - filter photographs of the region were made by walborn ( 1975 ) and deharveng & maucherat ( 1975 ) .",
    "these images showed the complex structures of the keyhole and the rest of ngc  3372 in ionized gas , and revealed many silhouette structures , such as dust pillars and globules , and the large , dark v - shaped dust lane that bisects the nebula .",
    "it was established early on that the v - shaped dark lanes are the result of obscuration by dust intermixed with molecular gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "far - infrared ( far - ir ) emission was detected from the dark lanes by @xcite at 80  @xmath4 m and @xcite at 120300 @xmath4 m , implying that the dust was warm , with t@xmath53040 k. the first single - dish molecular line studies of carina by gardner et al .",
    "( 1973 ) and @xcite revealed that these dark dust lanes coincided with the bulk of the molecular gas .",
    "pioneering radio observations of the carina nebula focused on the central region with angular resolutions ( fwhm ) that were typically 3  ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite first identified the two bright concentrations known as car  i and car  ii ( see fig .  [ fig : co ] ) .",
    "subsequent observations established that these two sources were thermal and represented two separate h  ii regions .",
    "car i was found to be located toward the north - western part of the inner nebula , and car ii was identified with the central keyhole nebula .",
    "@xcite was the first to separate @xmath0  car from the bright radio continuum emission of car  ii , and to highlight the similar ring - shaped structures of the radio source car  ii and the keyhole nebula seen at visual wavelengths .",
    "detections of non - thermal emission toward the nebula were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , no subsequent work has found convincing evidence to confirm these non - thermal sources .",
    "the non - thermal source g287.71.3 first reported by @xcite has since been shown to be extragalactic @xcite .",
    "the magnetar studied by gaensler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is located at a larger distance and well outside the carina nebula 1@xmath6 to the east .",
    "it is amusing to note that the first large - scale co study of the carina nebula at 115 ghz used the _ optical _ eso 3.6-m telescope at la silla in 1978 @xcite .",
    "these data were soon followed by the co survey undertaken by @xcite using the 4-m radio telescope in sydney .",
    "the resulting maps with a @xmath12  ( fwhm ) beam offered the most detailed view of the carina molecular cloud for more than a decade , and showed that the bulk of the molecular material was concentrated into a northern and a southern cloud . the total extent of the molecular cloud was revealed later in the columbia co survey of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the survey showed that the carina molecular cloud is part of a gmc complex that is situated on the near side of the carina arm and extends over 150 pc between @xmath7=284.7 and 289 , with a total estimated mass of 6.7@xmath810@xmath9  m@xmath10 .",
    "results from the first studies of the velocity field within the carina nebula showed complex structure that is still not understood .",
    "interpretations of the large - scale dynamics measured across the nebula involved merging spiral arms @xcite , rotating neutral clouds @xcite or old @xmath11  regions @xcite . on a smaller scale , the complicated dynamics measured in the vicinity of car  ii alluded to the tremendous influence of the stellar wind from @xmath0  car .",
    "motions of ionized gas were studied via radio hydrogen recombination lines ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and optical - line emission profiles ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all studies detected double - peaked profiles in the vicinity of car ii .",
    "@xcite proposed that the ionized gas lies in an expanding shell whose center of expansion is @xmath0  car .",
    "additional evidence for peculiar , high - speed gas motions in the vicinity of @xmath0 car has been seen in resonance - line absorption profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "these unusual multi - component profiles have received continued study in the optical and uv ( walborn 1982 ; walborn & hesser 1982 ; @xcite ; garcia & walborn 2000 ; walborn et al .  2002a , 2007 ) , but are still not understood .",
    "velocity components range over 500 km s@xmath12 and have sometimes been interepreted as evidence for a supernova remnant along the line of sight , although proof of this hypothesis remains elusive .",
    "elliot ( 1979 ) interpreted broad emission components as evidence for a supernova remnant in the keyhole , but these were actually broad lines in the wind spectrum of @xmath0 car itself that were reflected by dust in the keyhole ( see walborn & liller 1977 ; lopez & meaburn 1986 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are a few observational clues that hint at a possible young supernova remnant ( snr ) inside carina .",
    "in addition to the complex blueshifted absorption lines already noted , ir spectroscopy with iso revealed an unusual and strong broad 22  @xmath4 m emission feature , attributed to silicates by chan & onaka ( 2000 ) , who note that the only other source where a similar emission feature is seen is the young supernova remnant cas  a. carina also displays spatially extended diffuse soft x - ray emission across much of its central @xmath11@xmath6 region .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission was first detected in _",
    "data by seward et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , although seward & chlebowski ( 1982 ) concluded that the diffuse emission could be accounted for simply by mechanical energy input from stellar winds .",
    "we discuss this further in sect .",
    "early far - ir and molecular surveys described above found no luminous , embedded sites of active star formation in the bright central region of the nebula .",
    "additionally , no bright maser sources were identified in the region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the prevailing view until the mid-1990s was that carina was an evolved h  ii region devoid of active star formation .",
    "this view has changed dramatically in recent years , due in part to larger spatial coverage and higher - quality data at ir and radio wavelengths . in just the past decade , the carina nebula has been recognized as a hotbed of active , ongoing star formation where the star formation is occuring primarily at the periphery of the nebula ( smith et al .  2000 ; megeath et al .",

    "carina is several times larger , brighter , and closer than these other regions , many of which are at the far kinematic distance of 68 kpc and highly reddened .    unlike most massive star forming regions , the distance to the carina nebula is known accurately .",
    "a distance of 2.3 kpc ( accurate to @xmath152% ) comes primarily from the expansion parallax of the homunculus nebula around @xmath0 carinae ( smith 2006@xmath13 , 2002@xmath14 ; allen & hillier 1993 ) , combined with the fact that @xmath0 car itself is known to be within the carina nebula because its reflected light is seen across the keyhole nebula ( walborn & liller 1977 ; lopez & meaburn 1986 ) and because the homunculus occults light from the back side of the nebula but not the front ( allen 1979 ) . in general , this distance agrees with favored values derived for the star clusters in carina as well ( walborn 1995 ; th & vleeming 1971 ) , although a range of values up to several kpc has been reported .",
    "caution is always wise , however , as the sightline toward carina looks down a tangent of a spiral arm as noted above . to be more precise ,",

    "one normally assumes that the other clusters described below ( tr  14 , cr  228 , etc . )",
    "are not at vastly different distances since they appear to be involved in the same larger nebulosity and share similar kinematics .",
    "this has been the topic of some debate , however .",

    "this is a vital clue to the current state of star formation in an evolved h  ii region like carina , because it means that the majority of the nebular mass that is present is atomic rather than molceular , and therefore represents a huge mass reservoir that is not being tapped for current star formation .",
    "smith & brooks ( 2007 ) give a fuller discussion of this .",

    "this global view of carina suggests three main areas of interest , sampling three different phases in the development of a gmc : 1 ) the keyhole region and its small molecular globules represent the last shredded bits of a gmc core that has already formed a massive cluster ; 2 ) the northern cloud near the tr  14 cluster represents a relatively pristine gmc that does not yet seem to have very active star formation , but is clearly being irradiated by a massive cluster ; and 3 ) the southern cloud and south pillars represent a region that is currently being eroded and shaped by radiation and winds from a young massive cluster , giving rise to numerous dust pillars with a second generation of stars forming within them .",

    "the diffuse x - ray emission in the carina nebula is unusually luminous , about 10 - 100 times stronger than other giant h  ii regions , and it was the first among giant h  ii regions to be discovered to have diffuse x - rays ( seward et al .",
    "1979 ; seward & chlebowski 1982 ) . not surprisingly then , it is an important target for the currently - available suite of x - ray telescopes in space such as xmm - newton , the chandra x - ray observatory , and the suzaku ( astro - e2 ) mission .",
    "figure  [ fig : xmm ] shows a wide - field mosaic image of the diffuse x - ray emission in carina ( k.  hamaguchi , private comm . ) , composed of several individual pointings taken with the xmm - newton satellite .",
    "it illustrates that the emission from carina is a complex combination of point sources from o stars , wnh stars , and colliding wind binaries , plus diffuse soft x - ray emission that spans more than 1@xmath6 .",
    "many of the point sources are fascinating systems in their own right ( many are colliding - wind binaries like @xmath0 car and wr25 ; see corcoran 2005 , raassen et al .",
    "2003 ) , but we will not review the x - ray properties of these massive stars here .",
    "some fraction of the diffuse emission may also be contributed by unresolved low - mass t tauri stars that have formed alongside the massive members of these clusters and throughout the nebula , so spatial resolution is an issue when interpreting the data . with the superior spatial resolution of chandra , preliminary studies of small regions around tr  16 and",
    "tr  14 have revealed hundreds of point sources ( evans et al .",
    "2003 ; townsley 2006 ; sanchawala et al .",
    "2007 ) , but so far only a portion of the inner nebula has been studied with chandra .",
    "an accurate census of the low - mass x - ray emitting stellar population will be an important goal of an upcoming large survey of carina with chandra ( pi : l.  townsley ) .",
    "for the time being , one of the most pressing questions regarding x - ray observations of carina is the physical origin of the unusually bright diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the first explanation that usually comes to mind is that there may have been a recent supernova explosion in carina .",
    "if that were true , it would have stunning implications from the point of view of stellar evolution .",
    "namely , if a star exploded in the vicinity of tr  16 and tr  14 , we might expect that this progenitor star had an initial mass larger than that of @xmath0 carinae because it reached the end of its life sooner .",
    "little is known about the end fates of stars that massive , and it might alter our interpretation of @xmath0 car s role in the history of the carina region .",
    "it would also mean that carina is an example of a star - forming region caught in the act of polluting protostellar disks with supernova ejecta , with far - reaching implications for the origin of our own solar system ( e.g. , tachibana & huss 2003 ; hester et al .",
    "2004 ; desch & ouellete 2005 ) .",
    "thus , alternatives should be considered carefully .",
    "the diffuse emission can not be accounted for fully by an extrapolation of the discrete source luminosity function , but on the other hand , seward & chlebowsky ( 1982 ) argued that energy input to the diffuse plasma from collisions of the many o - star and wnh - star winds with the ambient medium was sufficient ( see also townsley et al .  2003 ; ezoe et al .",
    "smith ( 2006@xmath14 ) also showed that the integrated mechanical energy input from stellar winds was more than enough to power the expansion of the region ( see also smith & brooks 2007 ) .",
    "thus , there appears to be no _ need _ to invoke a recent supernova explosion on energetic grounds alone , but there are some other clues that make the specter of a supernova a hard hypothesis to rule out .",
    "for instance , the spectral energy distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission in carina varies with position in a peculiar way .",
    "studies of the diffuse emission with xmm - newton , chandra , and suzaku ( hamaguchi et al .  2007 ; townsley 2006 ) show that the diffuse emission immediately south of tr  14 and north of wr25 ( reddish hue in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm ] ) has both an intermediate / hard component at 0.62 kev and a softer component at 0.26 kev , with relatively normal abundances .",
    "by contrast the emission further south ( greenish hue running east / west across the nebula in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm ] ) requires only the 0.6 kev component ( no softer x - rays ) and seems to show enhanced ne and fe abundances .",
    "hamaguchi et al .  (",
    "2007 ) suggest that the lack of strong nitrogen enrichment and normal oxygen abundances favor the sn hypothesis , because one would expect stellar winds to contribute more nitrogen rich material .",
    "however , smith & morse ( 2004 ) showed that even in the case of an evolved massive star like @xmath0 car , the n - rich ejecta are tightly confined to within about 1  of the star , with progressively more normal n / o ratios at larger radii from the star . also , examining the different color of x - ray emission in figure  [ fig : xmm ] that represents different energies",
    ", one might wonder why the plasma that lacks a soft component and has enhanced fe and ne abundances ( green ) is spatially coincident with the v - shaped dust lane that bisects the nebula ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : quad ] ) .",
    "this region has the highest line - of - sight column density in the nebula ( smith & brooks 2007 ) , so it is not clear how strong absorption through a clumpy medium might affect the spectra .",
    "the alternative that a supernova focussed fe - rich ejecta exclusively toward the dust lane seems dubious .",
    "these questions do not appear to have easy solutions with available data .",
    "overall , we still do not know the origin of the diffuse x - ray emission in carina , and we look forward with great anticipation to the results of the upcoming large survey with chandra .",
    "in this review , we have highlighted recent work that portrays the carina nebula as a rich star - forming region , and a laboratory in which to study feedback from massive stars .",
    "it gives examples of the same detailed phenomena seen in closer regions like orion , while sampling a much more extreme stellar population analogous to that of 30 dor .",
    "the vicinity of the keyhole nebula gives us a view of the remnant of a gmc that has already been dispersed by massive stars in tr  16 , while the northern cloud near the younger tr  14 cluster is more intact , still awaiting vigorous star formation .",
    "the south pillars currently harbor the most active star formation in carina , where stellar winds and radiation are sculpting dust pillars and probably triggering a new generation of stars .    despite these recent highlights",
    ", we suspect that the most exciting work on carina remains to be done , with more comprehensive study of the overall properties of the gas and embedded stars .",
    "recent surveys with _ hst _ , _ spitzer _ , and _ chandra _ will soon yield a rich harvest of new results .",
    "the brightness and complexity of carina will undoubtedly provide new discoveries and exciting new challenges for future ir observatories like sofia and herschel , and it will no - doubt be a bonanza for planned millimeter projects in the southern hemisphere like alma and the single - dish telescopes at the same site . +",

    "<S> carina is currently powered by uv radiation from 65 o - type stars and 3 wnh stars , but for most of its lifetime when its most massive star ( @xmath0 carinae ) was on the main - sequence , the carina nebula was powered by 70 o - type stars that produced a hydrogen ionizing luminosity 150 times stronger than in the orion nebula . at a distance of 2.3 kpc , carina has the most extreme stellar population within a few kpc of the sun , and suffers little interstellar extinction . </S>",
    "<S> it is our best bridge between the detailed star - formation processes that can be studied in nearby regions like orion , and much more extreme but also more distant regions like 30 doradus . </S>",
    "<S> existing observations have only begun to tap the tremendous potential of this region for understanding the importance of feedback in star formation  it will provide a reservoir of new discoveries for the next generation of large ground - based telescopes , space telescopes , and large submillimeter and radio arrays . </S>"
