    "it turned out that there is a close relation between these two invariants .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that the poincar series of the simple ( except @xmath3 ) and the 14 exceptional unimodal singularities is the quotient of the characteristic polynomials of two coxeter elements which are related to the monodromy operators of the singularities . for the simple singularities this",
