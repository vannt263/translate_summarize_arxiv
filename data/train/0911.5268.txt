    "digital pictures , images consisting of pixels with discrete values , have been studied for several decades .",
    "the field of discrete geometry is concerned with the geometric properties of digital pictures , such as area , shape , boundary and connectivity @xcite .",
    "this is used in , among other things , the segmentation , thinning and boundary - detection of images , which have applications in industry and medical imaging @xcite .",
    "digital pictures are usually 2- or 3-dimensional .",
    "various grids can be used , such as square grids and hexagonal grids @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider binary digital pictures on a 2-dimensional square grid .",
    "the picture is a rectangle consisting of pixels or cells , i.e. unit squares that has value 0 or 1 .",
    "the number of cells with value 1 is called the _ area _ of the picture .",
    "two cells are called _",
    "4-adjacent _ if they have an edge in common , and _ 8-adjacent _ if they have at least a vertex in common .",
    "the _ boundary _ of a digital picture can be defined as the pairs consisting of two adjacent cells , one with value 0 and one with value 1 @xcite .",
    "if we do this for 4-adjacency , then the boundary corresponds to the edges that separate the cells with value 1 from the cells with value 0 .",
    "the number of such edges is called the _ length of the boundary _ or sometimes the _ perimeter length _ @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider an unknown binary image , of which the length of the boundary and the area of the picture are given .",
    "these two values together contain some information about the general shape of the picture .",
    "we will study two properties of the shape in particular .",
    "firstly , using 4-adjacency , we can define the connected components of the picture @xcite .",
    "we will prove sharp lower bounds for the size of the largest connected component .",
    "the second question that we are interested in is : what is the size of the largest ball containing only ones ? or equivalently , considering for each cell the city block distance to the boundary @xcite , what is the maximal distance that occurs ?",
    "we will derive some results about this question , both in the case that the connected components are all simply connected ( that is , they do not have any holes @xcite ) and in the general case .    after introducing some notation in section [ notation ] , we will tackle the first question in section [ component ] and the second question in section [ ball ] .",
    "let a _ cell _ in @xmath0 be a square of side length 1 of which the vertices have integer coordinates .",
    "binary image _ is a rectangle in @xmath0 consisting of a number of cells , such that each cell inside the rectangle has been assigned a value 0 or 1 .",
    "we will often refer to _ a one _ or _ a zero _ of a binary image , meaning a cell that has been assigned that value .",
    "when exactly @xmath1 of the cells of a binary image have been assigned the value 1 , we say that the image _ consists of @xmath1 ones_.    we will only consider 4-adjacency @xcite , hence we will simply call two cells",
    "_ neighbours _ if they have a common edge .",
    "two cells @xmath2 and @xmath3 with value 1 in a binary image are called _ connected _ if there is a path @xmath4 of cells with value 1 such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are neighbours for @xmath7",
    ". being connected is an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are called the _ connected components _ of the image .",
    "a connected component is said to contain a _ hole _ if there is a zero or a group of zeroes that is completely surrounded by ones of the connected component .",
    "the _ boundary _ of a binary image consists of edges of cells .",
    "an edge belongs to the boundary if    * it is the common edge of two neighbouring cells , one of which has value 1 and one of which has value 0 , or * it belongs to exactly one cell within the rectangle ( i.e. it is part of the outer edge of the rectangle ) and that cell has value 1 .",
    "we define the _ length of the boundary _ as the number of edges that belong to the boundary . a binary image with its boundary is shown in figure [ figurebinary1 ] .",
    "for each cell @xmath2 with value 1 in a binary image , we define the _ distance to the boundary _",
    "@xmath8 recursively .",
    "a cell of which one of the edges belongs to the boundary , has distance 0 to the boundary . for any other cell @xmath2 with value 1 , we set @xmath9 see figure [ figurebinary2 ] for an example . in the literature",
    "this specific distance function is often referred to as city block distance @xcite .    for any integer @xmath10",
    "we define the _ @xmath11-boundary _ similarly to the boundary .",
    "an edge belongs to the @xmath11-boundary if it is a common edge of two cells with value 1 , one of which has distance @xmath12 to the boundary and the other of which has distance @xmath11 to the boundary .",
    "the @xmath11-boundary separates the cells @xmath2 with value 1 and @xmath13 from the cells @xmath2 with value 0 or @xmath14 .",
    "we say that a binary image contains a _ ball with radius @xmath15 _ if there is a cell with value 1 that has distance at least @xmath15 to the boundary . in that case",
    "the connected component containing this cell must contain at least @xmath16 cells .",

    "this is the smallest possible boundary for this number of ones ( see also lemma [ lemma4wortel ] ) .",
    "if the length of the boundary is greater than @xmath20 , then the image may contain more than one connected component .",
    "we can , however , still prove a good lower bound on the size of the largest connected component .",
    "we will do this in two cases : when the boundary has length @xmath20 plus some constant , and when the boundary has length @xmath20 times some constant . in the second case we will also generalise to an image consisting of @xmath1 ones , where @xmath1 does not need to be a square .",
