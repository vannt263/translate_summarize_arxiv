    "the realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite in dilute atomic gases in which the atoms are confined in magnetic traps and cooled down to temperatures of order of fraction of microkelvins has opened a new era in atomic physics .",
    "the experimental and theoretical effort on the understanding of bec is truly interdisciplinary  @xcite and the beautiful demonstration of bec in atomic gases has rekindled both the experimental and theoretical interests  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of bose - einstein condensation in weakly interacting dilute gases has a long history  @xcite and has accounted for many experimental results  @xcite .",
    "pioneering work on the microscopic theory of a bose - condensed gas was done by bogoliubov  @xcite , whose original observation that the wave function of the excitations around the condensate ( phonons ) is a linear superposition of free particle states with equal and opposite momenta has been recently brilliantly confirmed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a detailed and comprehensive theoretical description of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous bec is offered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the current experiments on trapped bose - condensed gases can measure with great accuracy the dynamical aspects of the collective ( quasiparticle ) excitations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "the earlier experiments  @xcite were carried at low temperatures and the measurements of the dynamics of the condensate revealed almost undamped oscillations with frequencies in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions based on the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments  @xcite probe the low energy dynamics of collective excitations at higher temperatures and show evidence for large frequency shifts and strong damping .",
    "there are several important processes that contribute to damping of collective excitations . at zero temperature",
    "a quasiparticle can decay into two or more quasiparticles of lower energies , a mechanism that was originally studied by beliaev  @xcite at zero temperature and by popov  @xcite at finite temperature in a homogeneous bose gas . at finite temperature",
    "an important damping mechanism in the collisionless regime is the landau damping  @xcite , which has recently been studied for trapped bose gases  @xcite within a time dependent mean - field approximation .",
    "the necessity for a firm theoretical understanding of the dynamical aspects of low - lying collective excitations in the condensed phase is underscored by the intense experimental effort to probe them . for a homogeneous bose gas in the condensed phase a classification scheme for the different types of theoretical approximations to study the excitations has been put forth in a seminal article by hohenberg and martin  @xcite and more recently discussed in detail by griffin  @xcite . a very important ingredient for a consistent description of the dynamics of quasiparticle excitations is the hugenholtz - pines theorem  @xcite , which is a consequence of the underlying gauge invariance  @xcite and similar to the goldstone theorem in that it guarantees gapless single ( quasi)particle excitations if a continuous symmetry is broken with short range forces  @xcite . since the hugenholtz - pines theorem is a consequence of the original gauge invariance and the ward identities that stem from it , it is important to guarantee that any approximation scheme to study the dynamics of low energy excitations respects this theorem  @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the equations of motion for the small amplitude perturbation in the condensed phase  @xcite highlight the necessity for a systematic treatment compatible with the hugenholtz - pines theorem .",
    "the usual approach to obtaining the equations of motion begins with taking the expectation value of the heisenberg equations of motion and invoking some type of factorization of the nonlinear correlators ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is at this point where approximation schemes to treat the nonlinear correlator may potentially conflict with the hugenholtz - pines theorem and the ward identities .    *",
    "the focus and goals .",
    "* we focus on studying the real - time evolution of the condensate perturbations in a weakly interacting , homogeneous bose - condensed gas to begin with , but our ultimate goals are to study consistently the nonequilibrium evolution of collective excitations and to establish contact with the experimental effort . in particular , we seek to obtain the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of condensate perturbation both for the homogeneous as well as for the inhomogeneous ( trapped ) cases and to study the nonequilibrium aspects of quasiparticle excitations in a bose - condensed gas .",
    "while the study of the homogeneous bose gas may not be directly related to the experimental effort , a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena in many - body systems is intrinsically of fundamental importance and may pave the way to a systematic treatment of similar effects in trapped atomic gases .",
    "of particular relevance for our study , at least for the homogeneous bose gas , is to assess the impact of the infrared divergences in the self - energies on the frequencies and damping rates of collective excitations . in a strict perturbative expansion in the weakly interacting homogeneous bose gas ,",
    "the quasiparticle self - energies feature infrared divergences , logarithmic at zero temperature and power law at finite temperature  @xcite",
    ". early work by gavoret and nozires  @xcite , nepomnyashchy and nepomnyashchy  @xcite and popov  @xcite points out that a resummation of the perturbative expansion leads to a cancellation of the infrared divergences in physical quantities .",
    "this result in turn suggests that the perturbative expansion requires a resummation to extract the quasiparticle frequencies and damping rates unambiguously , but the resummation scheme invoked should fulfill the hugenholtz - pines theorem . to our knowledge",
    "these issues have not been so thoroughly studied and whether such divergences require novel treatment in the case of trapped atomic gases seems to be an open question .    in this article",
    "we propose a consistent formulation of the nonequilibrium dynamics by implementing a field - theoretical approach to study dynamics out of equilibrium .",
    "the field - theoretical approach to bec has been clearly formulated both in the operator  @xcite as well as in the path integral formulation  @xcite .",
    "the functional integral formulation is particularly convenient as it can be generalized to study nonequilibrium phenomena by implementing the schwinger - keldysh formulation  @xcite at the level of the path integrals .",
    "recently , stoof  @xcite has advanced the schwinger - keldysh formulation of nonequilibrium field theory to study the dynamics of condensation in bose - condensed gases .",
    "our ultimate goal is to obtain a consistent and systematic analysis of quasiparticle frequencies and damping rates in both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous bose - condensed gases from a nonequilibrium approach .",
    "we begin such program in this article by establishing a nonequilibrium framework that allows to extract this information directly from the real - time evolution of small amplitude perturbations around the condensate in a homogeneous bose - condensed gas .",

    "* the novel method  @xcite implemented to obtain directly the equations of motion in real time leads to a simple derivation of the ward identities associated with the underlying gauge symmetry _ in _ or _ out _ of equilibrium . in equilibrium",
    "these ward identities lead directly to the hugenholtz - pines theorem .",
    "this method is therefore seen to lead to consistent equations of motion for quasiparticle excitations of the condensate , that fulfill the hugenholtz - pines theorem when the homogeneous condensate is in equilibrium .",
    "we show explicitly to one - loop order that the inclusion of absorptive contributions beyond the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation are necessary to fulfill the ward identities , which , when the condensate is in equilibrium become the hugenholtz - pines theorem .",
    "we obtain explicitly the one - loop self - energies including the absorptive contributions and their spectral representations beyond the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation . *",
    "we discuss nonequilibrium aspects such as the instabilities in the quasiparticle spectrum when the homogeneous condensate is not in equilibrium .",

    "<S> we present a field - theoretical method to obtain consistently the equations of motion for small amplitude condensate perturbations in a homogeneous bose - condensed gas directly in real time . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on linear response , and combines the schwinger - keldysh formulation of nonequilibrium quantum field theory with the nambu - gorkov formalism of quasiparticle excitations in the condensed phase and the tadpole method in quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this method leads to causal equations of motion that allow to study the nonequilibrium evolution as an initial value problem . </S>",
    "<S> it also allows to extract directly the ward identities , which are a consequence of the underlying gauge symmetry and which in equilibrium lead to the hugenholtz - pines theorem . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit one - loop calculation of the equations of motion beyond the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation reveals that the nonlocal , absorptive contributions to the self - energies corresponding to the beliaev and landau damping processes are necessary to fulfill the ward identities _ in _ or _ out _ of equilibrium . </S>",
