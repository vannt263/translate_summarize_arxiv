    "our purpose is to build an intensity - based modeling framework that can be used in trading and calibrating across the credit and equity markets .",
    "the same company has stocks , stock options , bonds , credit default swaps on these bonds , and several other derivatives .",
    "when this company defaults , the payoffs of all of these instruments are affected ; therefore , their prices all contain information about the default risk of the company .",
    "we build a model that can be jointly calibrated to corporate bond prices and stock options , and can be used to price more exotic derivatives . in our framework",
    "we use the vasicek model for the interest rate , and use doubly stochastic poisson process to model the default of a given company .",
    "we assume that the bonds have recovery of market value and that stocks become valueless at the time of default . using the multi - scale modeling approach of @xcite",
    "we obtain explicit bond pricing equation with three free parameters which we calibrate to the corporate bond term structure . on the other hand ,",
    "stock option pricing formula contain seven parameters , three of which are common with the bond option pricing formula .",
    "( the common parameters are multiplied with the loss rate in the bond pricing formula . )",
    "we calibrate the remaining set of parameters to the stock option prices .",
    "this hybrid model , therefore , is able to account for the default risk premium in the implied volatility surface .",
    "the calibration results reveal that our model is able to produce implied volatility surfaces that match the data closely .",
    "we compare the implied volatility surfaces that our model produces to those of @xcite .",
    "we see that even for longer maturities our model has a prominent skew : compare figures  [ fig : imp7p ] and [ fig : impvfouque ] .",
    "even when we ignore the stochastic volatility effects , our model fits the implied volatility of the ford motor company well and performs better than the model of @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : impvolford ] .",
    "this points to the importance of accounting for the default risk for companies with low ratings .",
    "once the model parameters are calibrated , the model can be used to compute the prices of more exotic options . to test whether our model produces correct prices we use the cds spread data and show that the model implied cds spread matches the  out of sample \" cds data . to compute the cds spread , under our assumption on the recovery , one needs to reconstruct the term structure of the treasury and the corporate bonds .",
    "moreover , one needs to separate the loss rate from the other parameters in the bond pricing formula ( see or for the cds spread formula ) .",
    "this separation is possible since we calibrate our model to corporate bond data and stock option data jointly as described above .",
    "the model - implied cds spread time series matches the observed cds spread time series of ford motor company for over a long period of time ; see figures  [ fig : cds3yr ] and [ fig : cds5yr ] .",
    "this is an interesting observation since we did not make use of the cds spread data in our calibration .",
    "this observation also shows that one can use our model to trade across different markets that contain information about the default risk of a given firm .",
    "our model has three building blocks : ( 1 ) we model the default event using the multi - scale stochastic intensity model of @xcite .",
    "we also model the interest rate using an ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( vasicek model ) . as it was demonstrated in @xcite , these modeling assumptions are effective in capturing the corporate yield curve ; ( 2 ) we take the stock price process to follow a stochastic volatility model which jumps to zero when the company defaults .",
    "this stock price model was considered in @xcite .",
    "our model specification for the stock price differs from the jump to default models for the stock price considered by @xcite and @xcite , which take the volatility and the default intensity to be functions of the stock price ; ( 3 ) we also account for the stochastic volatility in the modeling of the stocks since even the index options ( when there is no risk of default ) possess implied volatility skew .",
    "we model the volatility using the fast scale stochastic volatility model of @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate on index options ( when there is no risk of default ) that ( see section  [ sec : demnst ] ) , we match the performance of the two time scale volatility model @xcite .",
    "the latter model extends @xcite by including a slow factor in the volatility to get a better fit to longer maturity option .",
    "we see from section  [ sec : demnst ] that when one assumes the interest rate to be stochastic , the calibration performance of the stochastic volatility model with only the fast factor is as good as the two scale stochastic volatility model , which is why we choose the volatility to be driven by only the fast factor . even though the interest rate is stochastic in our model , we are able to obtain explicit asymptotic pricing formulas for stock options .",
    "thanks to these explicit pricing formulas the inverse problem that we face in calibrating to the corporate bond and stock data can be solved with considerable ease .",
    "our modeling framework can be thought of as a hybrid of the models of @xcite , which only considers pricing options in a stochastic volatility model with constant interest rate , and @xcite , which only considers a framework for pricing derivatives on bonds .",
    "neither of these models has the means to transfer information from the equity markets to bond market or vice versa , which we are set to do in this paper .",
    "we should also note that our model also takes input from the treasury yield curve , historical stock prices , and historical spot rate data to estimate some of its parameters ( see section  [ sec : calibration ] ) .",
    "our model extends @xcite by taking the interest rate process to be stochastic , which leads to a richer theory and more calibration parameters , and therefore , better fit to data : ( i ) when the interest rate is deterministic the corporate bond pricing formula turns out to be very crude and does not fit the bond term structure well ( compare ( 2.57 ) in @xcite and ) ; ( ii ) with deterministic interest rates the bond pricing and the stock option pricing formulas share only one common term , `` the average intensity of default '' ( this parameter is multiplied by the loss rate in the bond pricing equation , under our loss assumptions ) .",
    "therefore , the default premium in the implied volatility surface is not accounted for as much as it should be . and",
    "our calibration analysis demonstrates that this has a significant impact .",
    "when the volatility is taken to be constant , both our new model and the model in @xcite have three free parameters .",
    "the model in @xcite produces a below par fit to the implied volatility surface ( see e.g. figure 5 in that paper ) , whereas our model produces an excellent fit ( see section  [ sec : fordsimplied ] and figure  [ fig : impvolford ] ) ; ( iii ) to calculate the cds spread , in the constant interest rate model , one needs to separate the loss rate and the average intensity of default .",
    "this is again established calibrating the model to the bond term structure data and the stock option implied volatility surface .",
    "the estimates for the average intensity and the loss rate are not as accurate in @xcite as it is in our model because of ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "this crude estimation leads to a poor out of sample match to the cds spread time series .",
    "the other defaultable stock models are those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which assume that the interest rate is deterministic .",
    "@xcite , @xcite take the volatility and the intensity to be functions of the stock price and obtain a one - dimensional diffusion for the pre - default stock price evolution .",
    "using the fact that the resolvents of particular markov processes can be computed explicitly , they obtain pricing formulas for stock option prices . on the other",
    "hand @xcite uses a cir stochastic volatility model and also models the intensity to be a function of the volatility and another endogenous cir factor .",
    "the option prices in this framework are computed numerically using inverse the fourier transform .",
    "we , on the other hand , use asymptotic expansions to provide explicit pricing formulas for stock options in a framework that combines a ) the vasicek interest rate model , b ) fast - mean reverting stochastic volatility model , c ) defaultable stock price model , d ) multi - scale stochastic intensity model .",
    "our calibration exercise differs from that of @xcite since they perform a time series analysis to obtain the parameters of the underlying factors ( from the the stock option prices and credit default swap spread time series ) , whereas we calibrate our pricing parameters to the daily implied volatility surface and bond term structure data .",
    "our purpose is to find a risk neutral model that matches a set of observed market prices .",
    "this risk neutral model can then be used to price more exotic , illiquid or over - the - counter derivatives . for further discussion of this calibration methodology",
    "we refer to @xcite ( see chapter 13 ) , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also provide daily prediction of the cds spread only using the data from the bond term structure and implied volatility surface of the options .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce our modeling framework and describe the credit and equity derivatives we will consider and obtain an expression for the cds spread under the assumption that the recovery rate of a bond that defaults is a constant fraction of its predefault value . in section 3 , we introduce the asymptotic expansion method .",
    "we obtain explicit ( asymptotic ) prices for bonds and equity options in section 3.3 . in section 4 , we describe the calibration of our parameters and discuss our empirical results . figures , which show our calibration results , are located after the references .",

    "but , what is surprising is that the 3-parameter model , which does not account for the volatility but accounts for the default risk and stochastic interest rate , has almost the same performance as the 7-parameter model .",
    "the 7-parameter model has a very rich implied volatility surface structure , the surface has more curvature than that of the 4-parameter model of @xcite , whose volatility surface is more flat ; see figures  [ fig : imp7p ] and [ fig : impvfouque ] .",
    "( the parameters to draw these figures are obtained by calibrating the models to the data implied volatility surface on june 8 2007 . ) the 7-parameter model has a recognizable skew even for longer maturities and has a much sharper skew for shorter maturities .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show the importance of accounting for stochastic interest rates in fitting the implied volatility surface .",
    "interest rate changes should , indeed , be accounted for in pricing long maturity options .",

    "this was an improvement on the model of @xcite , which only has a fast scale component in the volatility model .",
    "we , on the other hand , by accounting for stochastic interest rates , capture the same performance by using only a fast scale volatility model .    from figure",
    "[ fig : spx ] , we see that both ( [ eq : indx ] ) and @xcite outperform the model of @xcite , especially at the longer maturities ( @xmath255 9 months , 1 year , 1.5 years and 2 years ) , and their performance is very similar . this observation emphasizes the importance of accounting for stochastic interest rates for long maturity contracts .",
