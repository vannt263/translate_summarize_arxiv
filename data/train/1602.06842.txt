    "classical billiards are dynamical system in which a particle , or an ensemble of non - interacting particles , move confined to and experience collisions with a boundary @xcite .",
    "basically , they are settled in three classes , namely ( i ) integrable , ( ii ) ergodic , and ( iii ) mixed . in case ( i ) , the phase space consists of invariant tori filling the entire phase space . in case ( ii ) , the time evolution of a single initial condition is enough to fills up the entire phase space . finally , in case ( iii ) , one can observe invariant tori , chaotic seas generally surrounding kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) coexisting . if a time dependent perturbation is introduced on the boundary @xcite , the system exchanges energy with the moving particles upon collisions .",
    "such type of systems have attracted a lot of attention lately because they can be used to study the phenomenon of unlimited energy growth also known as fermi acceleration @xcite . however ,",
    "how to identify in which type of system the phenomenon of fermi acceleration will be observed ? to answer this question ,",
    "loskutov , ryabov and akinshin ( lra ) proposed a conjecture where they state that a chaotic component in the phase space for the time - independent dynamics is a sufficient condition to observe fermi acceleration once a time dependent perturbation on the boundary is introduced .",
    "this conjecture became known as lra conjecture @xcite and over the years it has been verified in several systems such as the time dependent lorentz gas @xcite , oval @xcite and stadium @xcite billiard among many other systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , later on results have shown that the existence of a chaotic component is a sufficient , but not a necessary condition for fermi acceleration since the unlimited energy growth was also observed in a time dependent elliptical billiard . as it is known , the elliptical with static boundary is an integrable system whose integrability comes from the conservation of the angular momentum with respect to the two foci @xcite .",
    "however , when a time dependent perturbation is introduced into the system , the separatrix is replaced by a chaotic layer and trajectories that were confined inside the separatrix ( librators ) can now explore the region outside the separatrix ( rotators ) and vice - versa .",
    "this change of behavior , namely , librator orbits `` jumping '' to rotator and vice - versa turned out to be the mechanism which produces the unlimited energy growth @xcite .",
    "more recently , it became clear that such a phenomenon is not robust@xcite since a tiny amount of dissipation , either upon collision@xcite or during the flight @xcite , is enough to suppress fermi acceleration .",
    "the motion of the time dependent boundaries can be related to a more physical situation . indeed due to the thermal fluctuations ,",
    "the position of each atom on the boundary is allowed to move locally .",
    "such oscillation of the atoms , and hence of the boundary , can be extended to the context of billiard which allows us to connect the observables obtained from the velocity of the particle  such as the kinetic energy  to the thermodynamics , more precisely , the temperature and entropy .",
    "so far , such a connection has been made for the lorentz gas to describe the motion of electrons between heavy ions as in a lattice of metal @xcite .",
    "therefore , further investigation is needed to understand how the dynamics of the systems can be connected to more real situations .",
    "in this paper we study some dynamical properties for an ensemble of noninteracting particles in a time dependent billiard .",
    "our main goal is to understand and describe the dynamics of the mean squared velocity as a function of the time considering different values of the control parameters , namely , the dissipation upon collision , the parameter that controls the shape of the boundary and the amplitude of the time - dependent perturbation . of particles moving inside a closed domain . as an illustration",
    ", we consider a stochastic version of the time - dependent oval billiard .",
    "the introduction of a random perturbation on the border resembles the rough oscillations  producing a random exchange of energy upon collision  at least in the microscopic domain .",

    "in this section we present all the details needed to study the dynamics of an ensemble of noninteracting particles experiencing collisions with a moving boundary .",
    "as it is so usual in the literature , we describe the dynamics of the model in terms of a four dimensional nonlinear mapping @xmath0 that gives the angular position of the particle @xmath1 ; the angle that the trajectory of the particle forms with the tangent line at the position of the collision @xmath2 ; the absolute velocity of the particle @xmath3 and the instant of the hit with the boundary @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a typical illustration of a billiard and the angles used to describe the dynamics of the model .    for a given state @xmath17 ,",
    "the position of the particle as a function of the time is written as @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "therefore , the angular position at the next collision of the particle with the boundary , @xmath29 , is obtained by solving the equation @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the position of the particle is the same as the boundary , hence producing a collision .",
    "moreover , we can also obtain the time at collision @xmath31 by evaluating the expression @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a number taken at random from the interval @xmath36 $ ] introduced after the instant of collision and it is the variable that introduces stochasticity into the model . to obtain the particle s velocity at time @xmath37",
    ", we should note that the referential frame of the boundary is moving .",
    "furthermore , we assume the particle experiences a fractional loss of velocity / energy upon collision only on the normal component of the velocity .",

    "[ fig3a ] ( a ) .",
    "it is easy to see in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] two different kinds of behaviors . for short @xmath6 ,",
    "the average velocity grows according to a power law and suddenly it bends towards a regime of saturation for long enough values of @xmath6 .",

    "different values of @xmath50 generate different behaviors for the average velocity , however , applying the transformation @xmath71 , all the curves start to grow together as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] ( b ) .",
    "for such a behavior , we propose the following scaling hypotheses :    1 .   for small values of @xmath6 , such as @xmath72 , the growth regime can be described by @xmath73^{\\beta } , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the acceleration exponent ; 2 .   for sufficiently large @xmath6 ,",
    "say @xmath75 , where the regime of saturation is reached , we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the saturation exponents ; 3 .",
    "finally , the characteristic value of @xmath6 which provides the changeover from growth to the saturation is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are crossover exponents .",

    "since the results obtained in the previous section were purely numerical , a more detailed analytical investigation is needed .",
    "to study analytically the average velocity of an ensemble of noninteracting particles , the corresponding probability distribution for the velocity in the two - dimensional phase space , i.e , @xmath114 , must be known . for the deterministic case ,",
