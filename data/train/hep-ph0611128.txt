    "the problem of particles interactions under an external environment influence , provided by the presence of external electromagnetic fields or media , is one of the important issues of particle physics .",
    "in addition to possibility for better visualization of fundamental properties of particles and their interactions being imposed by influence of an external conditions , the interest to this problem is also stimulated by important applications to description of different processes in astrophysics and cosmology , where strong electromagnetic fields and dense matter may play an important role .",
    "what is concerned the influence of strong external electromagnetic fields , there is a well known method which enables one to account for an external field influence on a charged particle exactly , rather than within the perturbation - series expansion . in this techniques , known in quantum electrodynamics as the furry representation @xcite , consideration of a quantum process",
    "is based on the use of exact solutions of the corresponding modified dirac equation for the particle wave function , @xmath0 which accounts for the external field classical potential @xmath1 .",
    "the quantized part of the potential @xmath2 , that corresponds to the electromagnetic radiation field , is treated within the perturbation - series techniques .",
    "a detailed discussion of this method can be found in @xcite .    in a series of our papers",
    "@xcite we have developed a rather powerful method for investigation of different phenomena that can appear when neutrinos and electrons move in background matter .",
    "the method discussed is based on the use of the modified dirac equations for particles wave functions , in which the correspondent effective potentials accounting for the standard model interaction of particles with matter are included .",
    "it is similar to the furry representation @xcite in quantum electrodynamics , briefly discussed above .",
    "in @xcite we apply the discussed method for elaboration of the quantum theory of the  spin light of neutrino \"  ( @xmath3 ) in matter .",
    "the spin light of neutrino in matter , one of the four new phenomena studied in our recent papers ( see for a review @xcite ) , is an electromagnetic radiation that can be emitted by a massive neutrino ( due to its non - zero magnetic moment ) when the particle moves in the background matter . within the quasi - classical treatment the existence of this radiation",
    "was first proposed and studied in @xcite , while the quantum theory of this phenomenon was developed in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that different forms of the neutrino quantum wave equations in the presence of matter were used previously for consideration of modifications of a neutrino dispersion relation @xcite . as it was shown in @xcite , the standard result for the msw effect @xcite",
    "can be derived using the modified dirac equation for the neutrino wave function with the matter potential proportional to the density being added .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that a neutrino energy minimum is at nonzero momentum .",
    "different interactions of majorana neutrinos to hypothetical scalar particles ( majorons ) in the presence of background matter on the basis of the modified dirac equation were studied in @xcite .",
    "the problem of a neutrino mass generation in different media @xcite , as well as spontaneous neutrino - pair creation in matter were also studied @xcite .",
    "as it has been discussed @xcite , the approach , developed at first for description of a neutrino motion in the background matter , can be spread for the case of an electron propagating in matter . in this letter",
    "we continue the study of an electron motion in matter on the basis of the modified dirac equation and its exact solutions .",
    "we consider interaction of an electron with the nuclear matter @xcite within the standard model , a problem which has astrophysical relevance ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    as an example of how the developed method works in studies of different possible processes , generated by electrons propagating in matter",
    ", we considered below in detail electromagnetic radiation that can be emitted by an electron in the background matter .",
    "we have termed this radiation the  spin light of electron \"  ( @xmath4 ) in matter @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that the term  spin light of electron \"  was first introduced in @xcite for designation of the synchrotron radiation power particular contribution connected with an intrinsic magnetic moment of an electron .",
    "note that our focus is on the standard model interactions of electrons with the background matter",
    ". a similar approach , which implies the use of the exact solutions of the correspondent modified dirac equations , can be developed in the case when electrons interact with different external fields predicted within various extensions of the standard model ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "consider an electron moving in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this model of matter can be used in studies of different processes in astrophysics ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . the modified dirac equation for an electron with account for matter motion and polarization",
    "can be obtained by the variation procedure applied to the standard dirac lagrangian with an additional effective interaction part @xcite ) @xmath5 this leads to the modified dirac equation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron mass , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the four - vector @xmath10 accounts for the effects of matter motion and polarization and can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the neutron current and polarization , respectively ( for further details see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the form of the obtained modified dirac equation ( [ moddireq_e ] ) for an electron having the standard model interaction with the neutron matter is similar to the modified dirac equation generated in the framework of standard model extensions with cpt violation and lorenz breaking @xcite .",
    "obviously , the nature of the effective potential @xmath10 in our case is completely different .    in several particular cases the modified dirac equation ( [ moddireq_e ] )",
    "can be solved exactly .",
    "we consider below the case of unpolarized neutrons for which the vector @xmath14 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number density of the neutron matter and @xmath17 is the speed of the reference frame in which the mean momentum of neutrons is zero . here below we",
    "obtain an exact expression for the electron wave function @xmath18 in a way similar to the one applied previously in @xcite for solving the problem of a neutrino motion in the presence of matter background . from eq.([moddireq_e ] ) it follows that the operators of electron momentum , @xmath19 , and longitudinal polarization , @xmath20 , are the integrals of motion , so that , in particular , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the pauli matrixes and the values @xmath23 specify the two electron helicity states . assuming the plane - wave dependence of the electron wave function in matter , @xmath24 and applying the condition that the equation ( [ moddireq_e ] ) has a non - trivial solution , we get the energy spectrum of an electron moving in the background matter : @xmath25 where the matter density parameter @xmath26 is @xmath27 the quantity @xmath28 splits the solutions into the two branches that in the limit of the vanishing matter density , @xmath29 , reproduce the positive and negative - energy solutions , respectively , which is attributed to the particle and anti - particle states .",
    "the solution can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalization length and @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are the electron momentum components .",
    "note that the difference in the obtained electron wave function and energy ( given by ( [ spinor_ab_e ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) respectively ) and the corresponding electron neutrino wave function and energy @xcite in the neutron background matter is due to the neutron number density @xmath35 enters the electron and neutrino characteristics with opposite signs and the appearance of an additional factor @xmath36 in the last term of the electron energy ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "as it follows from the expression ( [ energy ] ) for the electron energy in matter , for a given momentum @xmath37 the electron energy of the negative - helicity state exceeds that of the positive - helicity state , thereby enabling the radiation transition @xmath38 .",
    "this process originates due to the dependence of the electron dispersion law on the density of matter and may proceed even in the case when the photon refractive index in matter equals to @xmath39 .",
    "we term this radiation the spin light of electron in matter because it originates from the electron magnetic moment while the particle moves in the background matter .",
    "the amplitude of the process is given by @xmath40 matrix element @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the electron charge , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the electron wave functions in the initial and final states respectively , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are momentum and polarization vectors of the emitted photon .",
    "the further calculations are similar to those performed for the spin light of neutrino in matter ( see @xcite ) . after performing integration over space - time in eq.([amplitude_e ] ) we get the law of energy - momentum conservation for the process , @xmath47 where unprimed and primed quantities refer to the energy and momentum of the initial and final electrons , respectively .    using the energy - momentum conservation and the exact expressions for the initial and final electron energies , which are given by eq.([energy ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that the only open channel of the process is the transition with change of the electron helicity from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "the revealed asymmetry with respect to the electron helicity enables us to predict the existence of the electron spin - polarization effect .",
    "we obtain from ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ e_law ] ) for the @xmath4 photon energy @xmath50 }     { ( \\tilde{e}-p\\cos\\theta)^2-(\\alpha_n m_e)^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the angle between the directions of the radiation and the initial electron momentum @xmath53 . in the case of relativistic electron and small values of the matter density parameter @xmath26 , that may be realized for diverse astrophysical and cosmological environments , for the @xmath4 photon energy we get from ( [ omega_e ] ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the electron speed . from eq.([omega_relativistic ] ) it follows that for relativistic electrons the energy range of the @xmath4 may even extend up to energies peculiar to the spectrum of gamma - rays ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "using expressions for the amplitude ( [ amplitude_e ] ) and for the photon energy ( [ omega_e ] ) we obtain the radiation rate @xmath56 and total power @xmath57 respectively , @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 here we also introduced the following quantities describing the initial and final electron respectively , @xmath61 the electron energy and momentum in the final state are determined by the relations : @xmath62 where @xmath63    performing the integration over the angle @xmath52 in ( [ gamma_with_int ] ) and ( [ i_with_int ] ) we get closed expressions for the radiation rate @xmath64}{(1 + 2b)^2\\sqrt{1+a+b}},\\ ] ] and the total radiation power @xmath65 - 8b^4}{(1 + 2b)^3},\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 .    as it follows from the above expressions , the @xmath4 rate and total power are rather complicated functions of the electron momentum @xmath37 and the matter density parameter @xmath26 .",

    "the lines two and three in eq.([m_e>>ap ] ) are for the non - relativistic case . the remaining line two of eq.([m_e<<ap ] ) describes the relativistic or non - relativistic case depending on the value of the matter density .    with the use of the obtained above values of the @xmath4 rate and total",
    "power one can estimate the average emitted photon energy @xmath74 for different matter density . in the case of @xmath70 we get from eq.([m_e<<ap ] ) @xmath75 where it is supposed that @xmath76 .",
    "thus , for the relativistic electrons the emitted photons energy is in the range of gamma - rays what is similar to the case of the spin light of neutrino @xcite .",
    "estimations of the initial electron energy obtained from eq.([energy ] ) for the two considered in eq.([omega_average 1 ] ) limiting cases show that the photon carries away nearly the whole of the initial electron energy .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation has been found in @xcite for the standard model extensions .    in the opposite case of @xmath72",
    "we get from eq.([m_e>>ap ] ) @xmath77 estimations of the initial electron energy for the latter three cases give @xmath78 so that small fractions of the initial electron energy are emitted .",
    "one of the important features of the @xmath4 is its polarization properties .",
    "it should be mentioned here that in our previous studies of the polarization properties of the spin light of neutrino in matter @xcite we have shown that in the case of dense matter the @xmath3 photons are circular - polarized .",
    "we first consider two different linear polarizations of the @xmath4 that are determined by two orthogonal vectors @xmath79 }    { \\sqrt{1-({\\bm \\varkappa}{\\bf j})^{2 } } } , \\ \\",

    "we have developed a method for the study of different processes with participation of electrons subjected to the standard model interactions with dense matter .",

    "it has been also shown that the @xmath4 photons can carry away a reasonable fraction of the initial electron energy and that electron spin polarization effect can take place .",
    "the performed detailed study of the @xmath4 polarization properties ( linear and circular polarizations have been considered ) has shown that for different values of the matter density the radiation can be significantly polarized and that the type and degree of polarization vary with change of the electron momentum and density of matter .",
    "finally , we compare the rates of the spin light of electron and spin light of neutrino in matter , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in a dense matter with @xmath112 , for the particles momenta  @xmath113 and for the neutrino mass @xmath114 and magnetic momentum @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 in agreement with our previous naive estimation @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ratio of total power magnitudes for the @xmath117 and @xmath118 is @xmath119 considering an electron with momentum @xmath120 moving in matter characterized by the number density @xmath121 we get for the rate of the process @xmath122 which corresponds to the characteristic electron life - time @xmath123 .",
