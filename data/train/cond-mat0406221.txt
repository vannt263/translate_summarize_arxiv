    "giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect@xcite discovered in fe / cr multilayers has motivated much research on the spin - dependent transport in hybrid magnetic multilayers in recent years@xcite .",
    "parkin et al.parkin has observed that the interlayer exchange coupling oscillates damply with the cr or ru spacer layer thickness in co / ru , co / cr and fe / cr superlattice systems , which suggests that the quantum - well states be formed in the spacer layer .",
    "this is because the electrons may meet multi - reflection at the interfaces between the ferromagnets and the spacer layer , leading to the oscillation of density of states ( dos ) of electrons at the fermi level , and thereby giving rise to the oscillation of the interlayer exchange coupling with the spacer thickness@xcite . on the other hand , the magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) such as the ferromagnet / insulator / ferromagnet ( fm / i / fm ) structure",
    "was found to display the spin - valve effect@xcite .",
    "the mtj with double tunnel barriers such as fm / i / fm / i / fm structure was shown to reveal more interesting behaviors on the variation of the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) with bias@xcite .",
    "recently , advances in nanolithography and thin - film processing make it possible to fabricate very small double tunnel junctions called the single electron transistor ( set ) . with a very narrow spacer ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is important and may lead to new phenomena such as coulomb blockade .",
    "further investigation about the spin - dependent transport in a ferromagnetic set@xcite was performed intensively in the sequential tunneling regime@xcite@xcite and in the cotunneling regime@xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the oscillation of the tmr with a dc bias is observed ; while the tmr in the latter case is enhanced in the strong tunneling regime , and the coulomb blockade region is squeezed by the spin accumulation caused by the cotunneling .",
    "it would be interesting to consider another limit where the size of the spacer is not so small that the coulomb interaction is weak , and the quantum well states can be formed in the spacer . if an ac field is applied to the leads and the central spacer , one would expect that the interesting features of the tmr might appear due to new effective tunneling channels from the photonic sidebandssidebands induced by the ac field .    on the other hand , johnson@xcite demonstrated that the multi - terminal system is as important as the two - terminal system .",
    "in the so - called spin dipolar switching device ( i.e. the fm / nonmagnetic metal(nm)/fm structure ) , the current flows from one fm layer and out of the nm layer , while the other fm layer referenced to the nm layer serves as a voltmeter to give an output voltage which depends on the magnetization configuration of the two ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "fert and lee@xcite interpreted johnson s experiment by means of the boltzmann equation , and at almost the same time , hershfield et al.@xcite proposed a set of weak coupling equations to describe johnson s experiment . by invoking the framework of the scattering matrix theory ( smt ) developed by landauer and bttiker@xcite for the mesoscopic devices with multi - terminal , brataas et al.@xcite discussed a three - terminal device which is to some extent different from johnson s experimental layout , where the current does not flow out of the nm layer but out of another fm layer , and the nm layer serves as a central spacer region , while a third fm layer is introduced to measure the chemical potential and no net current flows through it .",
    "in other words , the current entering the third fm lead is equal to that flowing out of it .",
    "it is found that the direction of the magnetization of the third fm lead can affect remarkably the current flowing through the first and the second fm leads when the magnetizations of these two leads align antiparallel . in this case , the intrinsic spin relaxation time in the central spacer was assumed to be sufficiently shorter than the order of the time between successive tunneling events such that the spin accumulation effect@xcite could be negligible .",
    "furthermore , jedema _ _ et al.__@xcite investigated the spin injection and spin accumulation in an all - metal lateral mesoscopic spin valve with multi - terminal .",
    "all these works were performed under dc biases . as mentioned before ,",
    "if an ac electric field is applied to the magnetic hybrid junction with multi - terminal , one would expect that different spin - dependent transport behaviors of the electrons might appear .    in this paper ,",
    "the time - dependent spin - polarized transport of a resonant tunneling structure with ferromagnetic multi - terminal will be investigated by means of the nonequilibrium green function technique ( negft ) .",
    "it is presumed that every terminal and the central spacer are applied by the ac fields . in our model , although the spin accumulation could present , as we shall pay our attention to the current and tmr in response to ac fields , the spin accumulation will not be considered , which will be given elsewhere .",
    "a general current formalism for such a system with @xmath0 terminals which are made of ferromagnetic materials or normal metals in the presence of an ac electrical field will be developed .",
    "a three - terminal device , to be coined as a spin transistor with source ( sts ) , in which every terminal is applied by a source bias , and there is net current flowing through each of them , will be proposed .",
    "the amplification effect of the electrical curent by changing the direction of the magnetization of the third fm terminal in a sts will be discussed .",
    "the photon - assisted spin - dependent tunneling in a two - terminal device under an ac bias voltage will be explored .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a model is proposed and a general formalism for the time - dependent current in a resonant tunneling system with ferromagnetic multi - terminal is derived . in sec .",
    "iii , the systems with two and three terminals in dc steady states are discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , the spin - dependent transport under an ac bias for a system with two ferromagnetic terminals in which the magnetic moments are noncollinearly aligned is investigated . in sec .",
    "v , a brief summary will be presented .",

    "we presume that the single - particle energy level , say @xmath12 , which can be viewed as a single - impurity level or a single energy level of quantum well states@xcite , is spin - degenerate .",

    "thus , if the spin relaxation time is not very short ( for example , longer than the tunneling time ) , the spin accumulation will occur . in the present model , we shall pay attention to the spin - dependent transport of the current and the tmr of the structure , and we will not discuss the effect of spin accumulation here for clarity@xcite .",

    "it can be observed that with increasing gate voltage the current first rises rapidly , and goes to the maximum at @xmath222 , then decreases rapidly towards zero , as shown in fig .",
    "for a large @xmath212 , the current shows a hump behavior .",
    "it can be understood as follows .",
    "when a dc bias @xmath212 is applied to the leads , the fermi energies of the left and the right leads are split by @xmath223 , i.e. @xmath224 .",
    "when the resonant energy level @xmath225 is in the region @xmath226 , the resonant energy level provides a tunneling channel and the resonance occurs , leading to that the current increases rapidly ; when @xmath227 , the energy level in the central spacer serves as a barrier and the current decreases with increasing @xmath219 .",
    "when the dc bias becomes larger , the width of the resonant peaks become wider , giving rise to a hump behavior .",
    "the gate voltage dependence of the tmr is shown in fig .",
    "when the gate voltage is small , for instance @xmath228 , the tmr goes to the minimum at @xmath222 where the resonant peaks of the current just appear . around the minimum of the tmr , there appear two `` shoulders '' on both sides of @xmath222 for different @xmath212 .",
    "when @xmath212 becomes larger , the `` shoulder '' becomes flatter . with increasing the external dc bias voltage ,",
    "the minimum of the tmr becomes a round peak while the `` shoulders '' become two minima .",
    "the origin of the shoulder behavior is the same as that explained above .",
    "now we turn to discuss a three - terminal device under a dc bias .",
    "the multi - terminal device has been extensively investigated within a framework of the mesoscopic device .",
    "for instance , a three - terminal device was discussed in terms of the landauer - bttiker scattering matrix theory ( smt)@xcite , where a third terminal is introduced to measure the chemical potential @xmath229 and the current flowing out of it is set to zero , say , @xmath230 . in this way , the chemical potential of the third terminal can be expressed in terms of the chemical potentials of the first and the second terminals .",
    "when electrons enter into the third terminal and then flow out of it into the scattering region , their phases are randomized . for a spin - dependent three - terminal device",
    ", johnson@xcite observed the spin bottleneck effect in a spin transistor . in a structure such as a fm / nm / fm multilayer",
    ", the polarized current is injected from one of the fm layers into the nm layer and flows out of it ; the other fm layer and the nm layer serve as a voltmeter to give a voltage output which depends on the magnetization configurations of the two ferromagnets .",
    "johnson and silsbee@xcite proposed the nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory to investigate the charge transport and the nonequilibrium magnetization .",
    "fert and lee@xcite investigated johnson s spin transistor device and discussed the effect of junction resistance on the spin accumulation based on the boltzmann equation .",
    "brataas et al.@xcite extended the smt to a ferromagnetic three - terminal system fm / nm / fm , where the current flows from the first fm terminal into the nm spacer region , then into a second fm terminal , but the net current flowing out of the third fm terminal is set to zero .",
    "when the magnetizations in the first and the second fm terminals are antiparallel , the current flowing through the first and second terminals can be varied with the magnetization direction of the third fm terminal through which there is no net current flowing , though .",
    "when the magnetization in the third terminal @xmath231 deviates by @xmath232 to the first one @xmath233 , the current goes to its maximum .",
    "here we propose a three - terminal spintronic device which is somewhat different from the one discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "we suppose that the third fm terminal is applied by an external dc bias too , enabling the net current to flow through it , just like a usual semiconductor transistor .",

    "second , we have considered a three - terminal device under a dc bias , which is different from the standard three - terminal device discussed elsewhererefs.@xcite . in the present device , each terminal is applied with a source bias , suggesting that there is net current flowing through every terminal .",
    "regardless of the spin - flip scattering , the electrons in up - spin subbands in one terminal will be accepted by the up - spin subbands in another terminal .",
    "when the magnetizations of the first and second terminals are antiparallel , the change of @xmath139 which is the relative angle between the magnetizations of the first and third terminals may considerably change the current flowing out of the second terminal .",
    "it turns out that tuning @xmath139 the current can be remarkably enhanced , giving rise to the so - called magnetization configuration - induced enhancement of the current or the current ratio @xmath290 .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath284 , which is defined in this case by the current change ratio when the configuration of the magnetizations of the first and second terminals is turned from parallel to antiparallel , decreases with increasing @xmath139 .",
    "third , as an application of our general formulation we have investigated the time - dependent spintronic transport in a system with two terminals under an ac field .",
    "we have uncovered that , when a very small dc bias is applied to the two terminals but an ac field is applied to the central scattering region , the photonic sidebands are formed in the central region . when the sidebands meet with the fermi energy of the terminals , the photon - assisted tunneling will occur .",
    "it manifests as the resonant peaks in the etc versus @xmath8 .",
    "the tmr exhibits many resonant peaks at the main resonant level and the photonic sidebands .",
    "it has been found that the asymmetric factor @xmath173 may lead to additional peaks besides the photon - assisted resonant peaks .",
    "we would like to mention that the present study might open a way to control the spin - dependent transport in a spintronic device by applying a time - dependent electrical field .",
