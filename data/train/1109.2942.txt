    "they can be summarized , in terms of how badly su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry is broken , as follows : a family ( an ensemble ) of bdg hamiltonians with completely broken spin rotation symmetry is called symmetry class d ( no trs ) or diii ( with trs ) .",
    "when one component ( @xmath3-component , say ) of spin is conserved , symmetry class a ( no trs ) and aiii ( with trs ) are realized .",
    "@xcite finally ,",
    "when full su(2 ) symmetry is preserved , class c ( no trs ) and ci ( with trs ) are realized .",
    "it is worth mentioning that historically symmetry class a and aiii have been discussed mainly in the context of electronic systems ( non bdg systems ) : in the original paper by altland and zirnbauer , class d , diii , c , and ci are called `` bdg classes '' , but not class a and aiii .",
    "@xcite symmetry class a , or unitary class , appears quite generally for electron systems which lack with trs , and also with any other discrete symmetries .",
    "symmetry class aiii describes an electronic system with broken trs and with _ sublattice _ symmetry ; i.e. , tight - binding hamiltonians with bipartite hopping elements only .",
    "while sublattice symmetry implies an invariance of the single - particle energy spectrum under reflection about zero energy , this is _ not _ related to phs of bdg systems when a class aiii system is interpreted as describing bdg quasiparticles .",
    "below , when we speak about symmetry class aiii , we will focus on its superconducting interpretation , since sublattice symmetry in electronic systems requires fine - tuning , while class aiii in bdg systems arises more naturally .    in three spatial dimensions ,",
    "there are three symmetry classes , out of ten altland and zirnbauer symmetry classes , for which non - trivial topological phases characterized by an integer topological invariant exist .",
    "these are symmetry class ci , aiii and diii .",
    "bdg hamiltonians in these classes have two discrete symmetries , trs and phs of different kind and as a result they anticommute with a unitary matrix .",
    "for this reason , topological phases in these symmetry classes are called chiral topological superconductors in ref .  .",
    "in this section , we will discuss effects of disorder in these 3d topological superconductors .",
    "for the most part of this section , we will mainly focus on symmetry class aiii .",
    "the formalism for classes diii and ci are largely parallel to class aiii , and will be discussed in appendix .",
    "the dynamics of quasiparticles deep inside a superconducting phase is described by a bdg hamiltonian . on a lattice with @xmath59 sites , which is convenient for the purpose of discussing discrete symmetries of various kind ,",
    "it can be written as follows : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is a @xmath197 matrix and @xmath198 .",
    "[ @xmath199 and @xmath200 can be either column or row vector depending on the context . ] because of @xmath201 ( hermiticity ) and @xmath202 ( fermi statistics ) , the bdg hamiltonian ( [ eq : bdg hamiltonian ] ) satisfies phs @xmath203 } : \\mathcal{h}^{\\ } _",
    "4=-t_{x}\\mathcal{h}^{{t}}_4 t_{x } , \\quad % \\mbox{[phs ( triplet)]}. \\label{eq : def phs ( triplet)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the pauli matrix @xmath204 is acting on the particle - hole grading .",
    "in addition to phs , depending on physical systems , trs @xmath205 } : \\mathcal{h}^{\\ } _ 4= { i}s_y \\mathcal{h}^{{t}}_4 ( -{i}s_y ) , \\quad % \\mbox{[trs]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and rotation symmetry for each spin rotation axis @xmath206 : \\nonumber   \\\\ % ( c ) : & \\quad \\qquad   \\big[\\mathcal{h}_4,j_{a}\\big]=0 , \\quad j_{a}:= \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } s_{a } & 0 \\\\ 0 & -s_{a}^{{t } } \\end{array } \\right ) , % \\nonumber \\\\%%%%% % & \\quad % \\quad % a = x , y , z , % \\quad % \\mbox{[su(2 ) symmetry]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be satisfied , where @xmath207 is the pauli matrix acting on spin indices .",
    "depending on their symmetry properties , bdg hamiltonians ( [ eq : bdg hamiltonian ] ) are classified into sub classes d , diii , a , aiii , c , and ci .",
    "when both trs and phs are preserved in the bdg hamiltonian , the relevant symmetry class is symmetry class diii . combining trs and phs",
    ", one can see that a member of class diii anticommutes with the unitary matrix @xmath208 , @xmath209 in this sense , class diii hamiltonians have a chiral structure .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to take a basis in which the chiral transformation , which is @xmath208 in the present basis , is diagonal . in one of such bases ,",
    "a class diii hamiltonian takes on the form @xmath210    a canonical example of the class diii topological superconductor is the b phase of @xmath211he , @xcite which is described , in momentum space , by the following bdg hamiltonian : @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the nambu spinor composed of fermionic creation / annihilation operators ( @xmath214 ) of a @xmath215he atom with spin @xmath216 and momentum @xmath217 , and the kernel takes the following form : @xmath218 the matrix elements are given by latexmath:[\\ ] ]      m.  r.  zirnbauer , j.  math .",
