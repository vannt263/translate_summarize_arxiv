    "since the early days of atomic physics , atoms in highly excited electronic states ( `` rydberg atoms '' ) have been extensively studied due to their exaggerated properties marking the borderline between classical and quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "recently , rydberg atoms have attracted interest as a possible implementation of quantum information processing based on neutral atoms  @xcite . representing an alternative to trapped ions or nuclear spins in molecular complexes  @xcite",
    ", neutral atoms offer extraordinarily weak coupling to dissipative processes of the environment thus promising long coherence times  @xcite .",
    "several schemes have been proposed to entangle neutral atoms and realise quantum gates  @xcite .",
    "ensembles of ultracold rydberg atoms appear to be particularly promising as they exhibit controllable electric dipole interactions over distances of many micrometres .",
    "the coherent character of these dipolar rydberg - rydberg interactions has been explored in ultracold gases over the last years  @xcite paving the way for the implementation of fast two - qubit gates .",
    "one prominent example for the strong rydberg - rydberg interaction is the so - called van der waals blockade .",
    "the van der waals blockade is the inhibition of multiple excitations in a mesoscopic ensemble due the interaction - induced energy shifts which separates the single excitation from multiple excitations energetically .",
    "it is a favourable tool in quantum information protocols  @xcite and has resulted in a number of experimental investigations .",
    "it was first observed as a suppression of excitation in macroscopic clouds for strong van der waals interaction at high principal quantum numbers  @xcite , later for both resonant and permanent dipoles  @xcite .",
    "it is accompanied by a change in counting statistics  @xcite and a modified many - body rabi frequency which has not been observed directly so far but evidence of which has recently been found  @xcite .    despite this success ,",
    "the realisation of single qubit operations with rydberg atoms has proven to be particularly demanding .",
    "while stimulated adiabatic passage has been used to achieve high rydberg excitation probabilities  @xcite , rabi oscillations of atoms starting from the ground state are hard to observe due to the small spatial overlap between the electronic wavefunctions of ground and highly excited states resulting in very small dipole transition matrix elements . in order to achieve sufficiently high rabi frequencies despite the small dipole matrix elements between the electronic ground state and rydberg states , one therefore needs high laser intensities provided by tightly focussed beams .",
    "the gaussian beam profile of a focussed laser beam , however , exhibits a wide range of intensities and would therefore impede the observation of synchronous rabi floppings in a mesoscopic sample  @xcite .",
    "one may overcome this by preparing the atomic cloud in very small dipole traps , rendering the atomic cloud smaller than the excitation laser and thus only using the central part of a focussed gaussian beam .",
    "this technique has recently been used for clouds between 1 and 10 atoms  @xcite .",
    "we have recently demonstrated rabi oscillations between ground and rydberg states in a frozen mesoscopic sample of roughly 100 ultracold atoms by applying beam shaping to ensure a constant intensity distribution over the excitation volume  @xcite .",
    "we restrict the excitation volume to the area where the shaped beam has a sufficiently constant intensity by spatially selective optical pumping . in this way we filter a signal of a subensemble of only 100 atoms out of a cloud of  10 million atoms . here",
    "we discuss the experimental details and thoroughly investigate important sources of decoherence .",
    "in addition we demonstrate the van der waals blockade for this mesoscopic system by observing a density - dependent suppression of excitation for strong van - der - waals interaction at large principle quantum numbers @xmath0 .",
    "ultracold atoms is marked by optical pumping with the pumper and repumper laser beam .",
    "a mesoscopic subensemble containing about 100 atoms within this tube is transferred to a rydberg state by near - resonant two - photon excitation with two counter - propagating laser beams at 780 nm and 480 nm , respectively .",

    "rb rydberg states .",
    "addressing of a mesoscopic subset of atoms involves depumping , spatially selective repumping , and optical pumping in order to single out the 3-level subsystem @xmath1 , with @xmath2=0(s ) or 2(d ) .",
    "decoherence effects from the short lifetime of the intermediate state are minimised by the detuning @xmath3 from the intermediate resonance thereby reducing the system to an effective two - level system . ]",
    "the experiment is performed with a cloud of ultracold atoms in a vapour - cell magneto - optical trap ( mot ) with about @xmath4 @xmath5rb atoms at densities of @xmath6 and a temperature below 100@xmath7k .",
    "the excitation is achieved with two counter - propagating laser beams at 780 nm and 480 nm via @xmath8 ( see figures  [ fig : setup ] and  [ fig : levelscheme ] ) . by detuning from the intermediate state @xmath9 , this",
    "state experiences negligible population which assures sufficiently long coherence times  @xcite .",
    "the excitation laser at 780 nm is collimated to a waist of 1.1 mm ensuring a constant rabi frequency over the excitation volume .",
    "the rabi frequency is determined from measured autler - townes splittings  @xcite with typical values of @xmath10mhz .",
    "the 480 nm laser alignment is discussed in sections  [ sec : shaping ] and [ sec : align ] .",
    "its frequency is locked to a temperature stabilised resonator built from zerodur@xmath11 which has a residual drift of @xmath122mhz per hour .",
    "we compensate for this by repeating identical spectral measurements , determining the line centres and interpolating the resonator drift .",
    "all lasers are switched by accousto - optical modulators ( switching times @xmath1250ns ) and guided to the experiment by single - mode polarisation - maintaining optical fibres .",
    "this ensures an unaltered alignment independent of changes on the input side , _",
    "e.g. _ when changing the laser wavelength for excitation of different rydberg states or for different detunings from the intermediate state .",
    "typically 30@xmath7s after excitation all rydberg atoms are field - ionised ( field pulse height 770v / cm ) and detected with a microchannel plate detector whose signal is recorded with a boxcar integrator .",
    "the delay of 30@xmath7s between excitation and detection suppresses a background of `` hot '' ( 300k ) atoms while it has no influence on the measured excitation probability of the cold subensemble ( see ) .",
    "we have verified that no spurious ions are present which is as expected for the short timescales and small atom numbers considered throughout this article . after detection the mot is turned back on and the whole cycle is repeated every 70ms .",

    "]    the 480 nm beam is focused and shaped to a constant intensity distribution over the excitation volume : the output of a single - mode polarisation - maintaining fibre is collimated by an achromat ( focal length 80 mm , 1 inch diameter ) to a beam size ( @xmath13 intensity radius ) of 6.9 mm and shaped by a diffractive optical element ( doe ) which is cemented onto a plano - convex lens with a focal length of 100 mm ( see fig .  [",

    "the doe effectively distorts the plano - convex lens to give a flattop profile at one specific distance close to the actual focus of the beam .",

    "the excitation volume is therefore given by the overlap between the 480 nm laser and the repumping laser .",
    "this allows us to align the lasers by first overlapping both foci ( minimising the excitation volume ) and then moving the repumping beam onto the flattop in the following way ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : align ] ) :    the red beam is produced from the output of a single - mode fibre with a mounting that allows alignment along the directions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "after a rough alignment the focus of the repumping beam is moved slightly above the blue beam by a small separation in direction ( 1 ) . moving the focus along direction ( 2 ) we only get an overlap with the 480 nm beam ( and thus a rydberg signal ) , when the divergence of the repumping beam is larger than the beam separation . in this way we can probe the rayleigh - range of the red laser and thus find its focal point .",
    "after this we can measure the local width of the blue beam by moving the red laser along direction ( 1 ) .",
    "as the mounting of the 480 nm beam allows movement of its focus along direction ( 3 ) , we measure the 480 nm beam diameter in this way at several positions along direction ( 3 ) and thus overlap the 480 nm beam focus with the red beam .",

    "is the use of liquid crystal elements  @xcite to dynamically optimise the diffractive pattern for better results .",
    "in addition we have demonstrated the van der waals blockade at large principal quantum numbers for a mesoscopic cloud .",
    "this indicates the onset of a local blockade as has been observed before for macroscopic clouds  @xcite .",
    "the full blockade regime can be identified by an increased rabi frequency @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath39 denote the number of atoms and the atomic rabi frequency , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the experiments presented here constitute a necessary prerequisite for the direct observation of this coherent many - body phenomenon . in future work",
    "we will use a number of options to reach this regime by increasing the interaction strength through higher densities  @xcite and using either resonant  @xcite or permanent  @xcite dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "smaller excitation volumes  @xcite will provide ensembles where even the interaction between the farthest separated atoms dominates all other energy scales .",
    "we thank c.  pruss and w.  osten from the institute for technical optics at the university of stuttgart for the design and production of the beam shaping element .",
