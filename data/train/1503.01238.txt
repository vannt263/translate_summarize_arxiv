    "x - ray emission from black - hole binaries ( bhbs ) comes from the release of the gravitational energy of accreting matter falling into a black hole .",

    "appear to be transient @xcite .",
    "there are a few lmxb sources that are observed to be persistent ( e.g. , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 : @xcite and grs 1758 - 258 : @xcite ) .",
    "however , their properties have not yet been studied in details , due to a lack of their observations .",
    "bhbs in lmxbs exhibit relatively short timescale outbursts ( @xmath4weeks or months ) and long timescale quiescence ( @xmath4years ) . both timing and spectral properties change vastly as the outburst evolves . specifically , there are three representative states : the low - luminosity hard ( low / hard ) state , the high - luminosity soft ( high / soft ) states @xcite and the intermediate state which appears during transition from the high / soft to the low / hard state .",
    "x - ray spectra in the low / hard state can be well reproduced by a powerlaw with a photon index of 1.42.1 @xcite and a high - energy cut - off at @xmath4100  kev , which is interpreted as the result of inverse - compton x - ray emission from the hot plasma around the black hole . in the high / soft state , the time variability",

    "this picture is supported by many studies ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "transitions between the low / hard and high / soft state during the outburst have been observed in many bhbs , and the energetic interaction between the disk and the corona during the state transitions has been modeled as a functions of time and the mass accretion rate @xcite .",

    "the short - term softening is characterized by an intensity dip of hard x - rays ( 1550  kev ) and also an intensity hump of soft x - ray ( 0.74  kev ) for a few tens of days ( subsection [ sec : ms ] ) .",

    "the fitting results of the x - ray spectra , which were reproduced well with a model consisting of optically thick disk emission and its comptonized component , were explained by a gradual decrease of the * diskbb * emission ( subsection [ sec:3 ] ) .    from these results , the short - term softenings are explained not by eclipse ( @xcite ) but rather by the state transitions associated with an increase of the mass accretion rate over a short - term timescale ( a few tens of days ) .",

    "the accretion disk extending down to the isco in the low / hard state has been suggested @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath92 increased from 0.12 to 0.30 as @xmath93 increased , suggesting that the covering fraction of the corona increases .",
