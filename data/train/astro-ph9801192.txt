    "rich clusters of galaxies are large cosmological laboratories that may provide unbiased mixtures of the matter content of the universe ( white 1993 , evrard 1997 ) .",
    "clusters are prominent structures in the universe ; their evolution can be followed with samples out to @xmath3 ( rosati 1998 ) .",
    "they are the most massive virialised objects in the universe and are the most recent objects to form in hierarchical formation models .",
    "their masses can be determined by several independent methods ( e.g. carlberg 1997 , cen 1997 , wu & fang 1997 , smail 1997 ) .",
    "the evolution of the mass function of clusters is sensitive to key cosmological parameters ( e.g. bahcall , fan & cen 1997 , bartelmann 1997 , borgani 1997 , carlberg 1996 , eke , cole & frenk 1997 , wilson , cole & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "this evolution can be calculated by using either analytic methods ( press & schechter 1974 ) or cosmological n - body simulations ( eke 1997 ) .",
    "the weakness of analytic methods is their inability to follow halos that accrete into larger systems . in the past",
    ", numerical simulations have shared this problem . to sample a large volume ,",
    "the poor resolution within virialised systems leads to soft , diffuse halos that are rapidly dissolved by tidal forces .",
    "this is the classic over - merging problem ( white 1987 ) that has lead to problems when comparing the mass distribution within dark matter simulations to the observed properties of galaxies ( summers 1995 ) .",
    "we were determined to perform simulations that resolved the distribution and evolution of galaxy halos within clusters .",
    "there are many questions that we will address with these simulations : what is the orbital distribution of the galaxies within clusters and are they biased in any way ?",
    "what is the extent of galactic dark halos within clusters and how much of the cluster s mass distribution is attached to galaxies ? how do these properties evolve with time and within different cosmological models ?",
    "are the density profiles of isolated `` field '' halos similar to the halos that form within the environment of a rich cluster ?",
    "how does the cluster environment modify the internal structure of halos ?",
    "the frequency of mergers between halos within the cluster environment and the heating rate from halo ",
    "halo encounters are questions of importance for studies of the morphological evolution of clusters .",
    "these are amongst the many questions that have remained unanswered due to the over - merging problem .",
    "some have suggested that the only way to avoid merging is to follow the evolution of the baryons  even if they are only @xmath4 of the mass ( evrard 1994 ) .",
    "this assertion seems counter - intuitive ; it s now clear that mass and force resolution can overcome the overmerging problem in dark matter simulations ( cf .",

    "with fast parallel computers and highly tuned algorithms , our simulations have hundreds of surviving halos within the virial radius of a rich cluster ( moore 1997 ) . increased mass and force resolution lead to higher central densities in galactic halos , enabling greater survival within a cluster .",
    "for the first time we can compare the mass distribution with the galaxy distribution in a rich cluster .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we describe the n - body simulation , techniques and parameters . in ",
    "[ s : iden ] we describe two algorithms to identify `` halos within halos '' . after creating a catalogue of halos ,   [ s : dist ] turns to results on their global properties ; sizes , masses , radial distribution , orbital properties and merger histories . ",
    "[ s : pint ] discusses the internal properties of halos : their density profiles , correlations between structure parameters and global parameters and the evolution of these quantities with time .",
    "we conclude in   [ s : conc ] .",
    "one of the goals of performing cosmological numerical simulations is to compare the distribution and bulk properties of dark matter with the distribution and properties of the observable galaxies .",
    "a direct comparison has never been possible , since structure in high density regions has been quickly erased as a consequence of numerical resolution  the overmerging problem .",
    "`` galaxies '' are typically selected from the mass distribution in a cosmological simulation using a biased sample of dark matter particles .",
    "previous studies of cluster substructure has been limited to using `` galaxy tracers '' ( carlberg 1991 , summers 1995 ) , such as following the most bound particle of a halo before it becomes disrupted by the tidal field of the system .",
    "these hueristics enable the use of low resolution simulations , but their validity is anyone s guess at this point ( summers 1995 ) .",
    "there are now several codes that are able to simulate a gaseous component .",
    "although these codes are invaluable for many astrophysical problems ; the original motivation behind these techniques was the hope of resolving galaxies in a cosmological context , thus solving the overmerging problem .",
    "they hoped to form galaxies and preserve them by increasing the central densities owing to gas dynamics . in turn",
    ", the halos would be more robust to disruption . indeed",
    ", sph simulations of individual clusters , do give rise to a set of galaxy tracers that resemble a `` real '' cluster .",
    "however , the mass resolution in the dark matter component is not sufficient to resolve the dark halos of the galaxy tracers , typically one is left with a cold gas blob orbiting within the smooth cluster background ( frenk 1996 ) .",
    "there are a variety of pathologies that arise if one uses too few particles to simulate a large dynamic range in scales .",
    "our simulations are designed to resolve scales of 5 kpc using dark matter .",
    "this would be a minimal resolution to simulate galaxy formation with gas dynamics .",
    "one needs a fiducial dark matter simulation at high resolution to see differences owing to gas dynamics .",
    "one must insure that these differences are sensible as an external check . with the gas representing @xmath610% of the mass , gross changes in numbers and orbits of galaxies",
    "would be surprising .",
    "our aim is to achieve very high spatial and mass resolution within a rich virialised cluster drawn from a  fair volume \" of 100 @xmath7 in a standard cdm universe .",
    "in such a volume , there are several rich clusters , and none dominate the environment in an undesirable way .",
    "any simulation method limits the number of particles that can be invested in a single simulation .",
    "previous simulations of clusters suffered limitations due to the small volume used , forcing the run to stop at @xmath3 , ( evrard , summers & davis 1994 ) , or or the use of vacuum boundary conditions outside the cluster ( carlberg 1991 ) .    with current technology , we can perform a single large simulation of @xmath8 particles or try to tackle a number of different problems using simulations with @xmath9 particles .",
    "if we simulate our  fair volume \" at uniform resolution , there will be @xmath10 particles within the virial radius of a cluster , a resolution that is insufficient to resolve substructure .",
    "previous attempts to resolve the inner structures of cluster halos using @xmath11 particles failed to resolve more than a handful of satellite halos ( carlberg 1991 , carlberg & dubinski 1991 , tormen 1997 , tormen _ et al _ ) . to achieve higher resolution within an individual cluster",
    "we initially perform a simulation of a large volume of a cdm universe as described above , normalised such that @xmath12 and the shape parameter @xmath13 ( h=50  is adopted throughout ) .",
    "we used a nesting scheme that we call  volume renormalization \" to achieve higher resolution within a region of greater interest .",
    "this technique has been used to probe quasar formation at high redshift ( katz 1994 ) and to follow the density profiles of halos in a cosmological context ( navarro 1996 ) .",
    "we generate initial conditions ( ics ) for the volume at two resolutions , one that places @xmath9 particles within the entire volume and one such that there would be @xmath14 particles in the targeted cluster . we run the lower resolution model and select a virialised cluster at @xmath15 .",
    "the particles within about twice the virial radius of the cluster in the final state are traced back to their locations in the ics . within this region ,",
    "we use the higher resolution ics . beyond this high resolution region",
    "the mass resolution is decreased in a series of shells by combining particles in the high resolution ics at their center of masses . in this way , the external tidal field",
    "is modelled correctly .",
    "the starting redshift in the high resolution run is increased to z=69 such that the perturbations in the smoothed density field of the high resolution region obey the constraint @xmath16 .",
    "we then re - run the simulation to the present epoch .",
    "we use a new high performance parallel treecode `` pkdgrav '' to evolve the particle distribution .",
    "pkdgrav ( stadel , in preparation ) has accurate periodic boundaries and an open ended variable timestep criteria based upon the local acceleration ( quinn 1997 ) .",
    "the code uses a spline softening length such that the force is completely newtonian at twice our quoted softening lengths . in terms of where the force is 50% of the newtonian force , the equivalent plummer softening length would be 0.67 times the spline softening length . in the high resolution region ,",
    "our particle mass is @xmath17 .",
    "we perform two runs with 10 kpc ( run1 ) and 5 kpc ( run2 ) softening lengths .",
    "the final virial radius of the cluster is @xmath18 mpc and the mass is @xmath19 so that we have approximately 600,000 particles within a sphere of overdensity 200 .",
    "( note that the cluster that is analysed here is the `` virgo '' cluster from moore 1997 . )",
    "in past work , halos in dissipationless @xmath5body simulations have usually spontaneously dissolved when entering clusters .",
    "two physical effects conspire with the finite numerical resolution to erase dark matter halos in clusters ( moore , katz & lake 1996 ) .",
    "halos are heated by cluster tides and halo  halo encounters , thus losing mass as they move into the potential well . when the tidal radius approaches @xmath20 times their  core radii \" ( owing to either a density plateau or gravitational softening ) , they dissolve .",
    "hence , it takes very high resolution to retain dark matter substructures at a distance 100 - 200 kpc from the cluster s center .",
    "our numerical parameters were chosen so that halos would survive at these scales .",

    "that is 0.25% of @xmath21 , we resolve 150 halos with circular velocity larger than 80 @xmath33 within @xmath21 at @xmath23 .",
    "most of these halos have made several orbits within the cluster and are easily identified as potential minima or density enhancements above the background .",
    "this work demonstrates that the overmerging of dark matter substructure within virialised structures can be greatly reduced given high enough numerical resolution .",
    "the statement that `` at bottom the problem [ of overmerging ] appears to be not numerical but physical : gravitational dynamics alone can not explain the existence of galaxy groups and clusters '' ( weinberg , katz and hernquist 1997 ) is , at the light of these new results , completely wrong .",
    "overmerging within the cluster environment is due to the disruption of halos by the global tidal field and halo  halo encounters ( _ c.f . _",
    "moore 1996 ) , probably primarily within the large dense halos prior to the formation of the main cluster .",
    "although our softening length ( 5 kpc ) is a small fraction of the cluster s virial radius , the rotation curves of the halos peak at radii of @xmath197 kpc .",
    "hence the cores of these halos can be softened to a degree that effects their evolution .",
    "this is the primary reason the halos are still being disrupted ; given high enough force and mass resolution , it should be possible to overcome _ most _ of the overmerging problem within cdm simulations .",
    "the aim of this paper has been to analyse the properties and dynamics of the dark matter substructure and we find the following key results :    * the orbital distribution of substructure halos is close to that of an isotropic population of tracers in an isothermal potential ; the median value of apocentric to pericentric distances is 6:1 , a value that does not vary with position within the cluster and is unbiased with respect to the orbits of the smooth particle background .",
    "circular orbits are rare and about 20% of all our surviving halos within the cluster will pass within 200 kpc @xmath200 .",
    "* most dark halos are tidally truncated to a value determined by the ( average ) density of the cluster at their pericentric positions .",
    "the approximation of isothermal halo mass distributions orbiting within a deeper isothermal potential works very well ; _ i.e. _ @xmath201 . *",
    "the mass attached to dark matter halos is approximately 13% of the entire cluster mass and varies from 0% within @xmath42 from the cluster center , to 20% at its virial radius .",
    "this latter value is roughly the expected value for the mass attached to halos above a circular velocity of @xmath202 . correspondingly , the sizes of halos vary with cluster centric radius , an effect that may be observable using gravitational lensing of background galaxies .",
    "* overmerging within the central regions of dense halos leads to a final distribution of substructure that is antibiased ( less centrally concentrated ) with respect to the global mass distribution . *",
    "the density profiles of a sample of well resolved halos indicate that those forming in the high  density regions of the collapsing cluster have higher concentrations than those found in isolated environments .",
    "we show that this is most probably due to their earlier collapse redshifts rather than the internal response of the halos to mass loss and heating from tidal stripping . *",
    "most of the halos within the cluster and in the cluster proximity have density profiles that are well fit by nfw profiles ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) . halos that lose a great deal of mass through tidal stripping have outer density profiles as steep as @xmath203 ( at @xmath204 of their virial radius ) , thus hernquist profiles ( hernquist 1990 ) provide slightly better fits .",
    "* mergers between halos in the cluster proximity occur with a frequency of about 510% since z=0.5 . in the cluster environment mergers",
    "are rare ; not a single merger occurs for halos whose orbits are contained within @xmath205%@xmath137 from the cluster center .",
