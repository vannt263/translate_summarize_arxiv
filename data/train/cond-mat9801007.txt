    "in order to study cellular automata systems displaying a second order irreversible phase transition to an absorbing state characterized by a scalar order parameter , a dynamical renormalization group ( rg ) algorithm @xcite has been recently proposed .",
    "these cellular automata models are in the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "the method is based on a dynamically driven renormalization group ( ddrg ) scheme ( for a recent review about ddrg see @xcite ) , which has been successfully applied to self - organized critical phenomena , as sandpile models @xcite and forest fire models @xcite .",
    "the basic idea introduced in @xcite is to couple a real space rg scheme to a stationary condition that drives the rg group equations through the parameter space .",
    "the stationary equations , involving the stationary distribution , have to be approximated , since the form of the stationary probability distribution is not known a priori , as in the case of systems in equilibrium .",
    "oliveira and satulovsky @xcite showed , as proposed in @xcite , that results can be improved using more refined approximations for the stationary probability distribution .",
    "the expression for the transition probability used in @xcite consists in a product of independent one - site transition probabilities at every step of the rg transformation .    in this work",
    "we exploit another aspect of the scheme , not considered before , in order to include additional correlations .",
    "in fact , correlations can be also introduced in the renormalization scheme if we allow the transition probability to depend upon more neighbors . in the case of non - equilibrium models ,",
    "the space in which the rg flows is the space spanned by the transition probabilities . as we will see later",
    ", our approach broadens this space providing more degrees of freedom to the rg trajectories that flow towards the fixed points .",
    "we apply the modified rg scheme to a probabilistic cellular automaton ( pca ) with one absorbing state already introduced in the literature @xcite . using a block renormalization that properly treats the nature of the absorbing state , we figure the value of the critical exponent of the divergence of the spatial correlation length , @xmath0 , using three different approximations involving correlations among clusters of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 neighboring sites in the lattice . our calculations for @xmath4 , at small orders of approximation in the mean field scheme for the stationary distribution , give better values than the ones reported in reference @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the model proposed in @xcite and the general renormalization scheme . after this",
    ", we define the algorithm used in this work and present the values obtained for @xmath4 . finally , after mentioning the ideas involved in the simulation technique used to study the model , we present the values of the whole set of critical exponents for the pca obtained by means of dynamical numerical simulations and stationary simulations .",
    "our results are in well agreement with the values corresponding to ( @xmath5 ) dp , and differ considerably from the ones reported in reference @xcite .",
    "the model studied in @xcite is a one - dimensional cellular automaton in which each site can be either vacant , @xmath6 , or occupied by a particle , @xmath7 . at each time step , the state of a given site will depend only on its previous state and the previous state of its nearest neighbors .",
    "the transition probability @xmath8 to state @xmath9 will be given by the product @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of sites and @xmath12 is the one - site transition probability given by the following rules @xmath13    this probabilistic cellular automaton models a transition from elementary rule 4 to elementary rule 22 ( following wolfram s nomenclature scheme ) @xcite .",
    "the system has two critical points , one of them at @xmath14 and the other at @xmath15 .",
    "the critical point at @xmath14 will be shown to be trivial , in contrast to the result obtained in reference @xcite .",
    "consequently , we will apply the rg to study the non - trivial transition point .",
    "rule @xmath16 implies that the vacuum state is indeed an absorbing state .",
    "the rg scheme proposed in @xcite is a real space rg scheme @xcite in which one renormalizes the transition probability , @xmath17 .",
    "the rg flow takes place in the space of parameters defining @xmath17 .",
    "a blocking procedure transforms cells of @xmath18 sites into one site at the new scale . in order to account for the fact that the vacuum state is absorbing",
    ", a cell devoided of particles will always renormalize into an empty site .",
    "cells with at least one particle have been chosen to renormalize into an occupied site .",
    "other options have been tried , but they do not preserve the existence of the absorbing state .",
    "let @xmath19 be the state of a system with @xmath11 degrees of freedom , and the vector @xmath20 be the state of the renormalized system with @xmath21 degrees of freedom , where @xmath18 is the size of the renormalization block .",
    "the conditional probability of state @xmath22 given state @xmath23 , @xmath24 , must satisfy @xmath25    given @xmath17 and the probability of a state @xmath26 at time @xmath27 , @xmath28 , one can write the joint probability of state @xmath26 at time @xmath27 and state @xmath29 at @xmath30 time steps later , @xmath31 , by simply applying @xmath17 to @xmath28 @xmath30 successive times    @xmath32    in addition , in the stationary regime , the probability distribution @xmath33 must satisfy    @xmath34    for any value of @xmath30 .    in the same way one can write these expressions at the coarse grained level .",
    "denoting by @xmath35 the probability of occurrence of state @xmath36 at a given time and state @xmath22 one time step later , the rg transformation is obtained imposing @xcite @xmath37 from which follows @xmath38    once knowing the transition probabilities at the coarse grained scale , one can easily build the rescaled transition matrix , @xmath39 , as    @xmath40    using now equations ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , and ( [ 8 ] ) , we obtain the final expression for the renormalization equations @xcite @xmath41    let us note that , while this equation expresses rescaled transition probabilities , @xmath42 , in terms of transition probabilities at a lower scale , @xmath17 , the stationary weight of each state present in equation ( [ 11 ] ) , @xmath43 , is yet unknown .",
    "contrary to the case of closed systems in thermal equilibrium , we do not know a priori the expression for the stationary probability distribution .",
    "however , including equation ( [ 6 ] ) , one can get a closed set of equations to solve at each renormalization step .",
    "the stationarity condition ( [ 6 ] ) is actually essential in driving the rg equations ( [ 11 ] ) through parameter space .",
    "equation ( [ 11 ] ) , together with a given approximation for the stationary probability , provide then a well defined rg transformation @xmath44 .    in practice , equation ( [ 6 ] )",
    "can hardly be solved and one must resort to approximations .",
    "the values of critical exponents obtained using the present rg approach are expected to improve as these approximations improve .",
    "we have used three different levels of approximations , in which correlations among clusters of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 sites are considered respectively .    in this work",
    "we will be concerned with another way to improve the rg scheme .",
    "an important point is that , in order to solve equations ( [ 11 ] ) , an assumption needs to be made on how the transition probability between states @xmath45 and @xmath22 , @xmath39 , depends on local transition probabilities at the coarse grained level .",
    "this choice will determine the degree of proliferation that the rg will have , since the form of the renormalized transition probability will be preserved along the rg trajectories .    in the former approach @xcite , the authors carried out the most general rg transformation considering one - site transition probabilities . by preserving the form of the renormalized transition probabilities ,",
    "the rg trajectories are found to flow to the attractive fixed points in a five - dimensional space spanned by the dynamical parameters .",
    "in contrast to usual rg methods in which new couplings arise at each step of the transformation , this rg procedure is not able to proliferate the dynamical parameters since the form of the transition probabilities are kept fixed at the coarse grained level .",
    "however , new dynamical parameters can be considered from the very beginning if we allow the transition probabilities to depend upon more neighbors , i.e. , introducing more correlations in them .",
    "this feature of the method should be compared with other dynamical rg procedures @xcite where the introduction of new couplings since the very beginning is an alternative way to carry out the rg transformation .",
    "we propose , then , a form for the coarse grained transition probability consisting of a product of independent two - site transition probabilities instead of one - site transition probabilities . denoting the position of each lattice site with @xmath46 ,",
    "the new transition probability is defined at even time steps as @xmath47 and at odd time steps as @xmath48 here we have used the same symbol , @xmath49 , to indicate a different type of transition probability than the ones appearing in ( [ one - site ] ) . in formulas ( [ 12.even ] ) and ( [ 12.odd ] ) periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "one can retrieve at any time one - site transition probabilities knowing both two - site probabilities and the stationary distribution .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath50    using expressions ( [ 12.even ] ) and ( [ 12.odd ] ) in equation ( [ 11 ] ) one can implement the rg transformation .",
    "the algorithm we used is explained in more detail in the next section .",
    "we have used a temporal coarse graining of two time steps ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the blocking operator , @xmath52 , was chosen in the same way as in @xcite , renormalizing cells of size @xmath53 into one site @xmath54 with @xmath55 and@xmath56 in order to preserve the nature of the absorbing state , we have also required @xmath57 to satisfy @xmath58 and @xmath59 whenever @xmath60 or @xmath61    the diagram in figure ( [ scheme ] ) indicates how two - site transition probabilities are renormalized .",
    "indexes appearing in equation  ( [ 31])-([33 ] ) refer to this diagram .    using equations ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12.even ] ) , and ( [ 12.odd ] ) , we can write down the expression relating @xmath62 to @xmath63 , which is given by @xmath64}^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\sum_{\\sigma _ 1 \\sigma _ 2 \\sigma _ 3 \\sigma _ 4 \\sigma _ { 11 } \\cdots   \\sigma _ { 18}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !   r(s _ 1|\\sigma _ 1,\\sigma _ 2 ) r(s _ 2|\\sigma _ 3,\\sigma _ 4 )   r(s_3|\\sigma _ { 11},\\sigma _ { 12 } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; r(s_4|\\sigma _ { 13},\\sigma _ { 14 } ) r(s_5|\\sigma _ { 15},\\sigma _ { 16 } ) r(s_6|\\sigma _ { 17},\\sigma _ { 18 } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & d(\\sigma _ 1,\\sigma _ 2,\\sigma _ 3,\\sigma _",
    "4|\\sigma _ { 11},\\cdots , \\sigma _ { 18 } )   w(\\sigma _ { 11},\\cdots,\\sigma _ { 18 } ) , \\label{31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    @xmath65    and @xmath66    since we do not know a priori the stationary weights , @xmath67 , we need an approximate method to estimate them .",
    "the simplest approximation , sometimes known as simple mean field approximation , consists in neglecting correlations among different sites .",
    "that is    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the solution of @xmath70    correlations , however , are actually taken into account in the geometrical aspects of the blocking procedure , leading to non classical exponents .",
    "better approximations can be also implemented ( as a reference see @xcite ) .",
    "we used one , two , and four - site approximations .",
    "equations ( [ 31])-([33 ] ) involve each transition probability .",
    "being so many terms , we are prevented from an analytical determination of the fixed points of the transformation .",
    "so , we performed our search numerically , using initial values for the transition probabilities that correspond to the original model ( table ( [ 2 ] ) ) .    as a technical remark , let us say that in each iteration of the rg , and given a set of parameters , @xmath71 , we need to solve equation ( [ 42 ] ) ( or its analogue for two and four - site approximations ) before the next rg step . we have done this by iterating the equation until reaching convergence .",
    "the behavior of the rg equations can be described as follows . for values of @xmath72 which are small enough",
    ", the set of transition probabilities flows towards an attractive fixed point characterized by a lattice devoid of particles .",
    "increasing @xmath72 above a critical value , @xmath73 , the flow is driven to another attractive fixed point , consisting of a lattice full of particles . the value of @xmath73 , for each level of approximation used ,",
    "can be found in table ( [ lambdanu ] ) .",
    "starting around the critical values , the representative point of the parameter set spends a long time near an unstable fixed point before leaving towards one of the two attractive fixed points .",
    "a projection of the rg flow along two specific transition probabilities is shown in figure ( [ rgflow ] ) .",
    "= 2.7 in    we have found one relevant parameter . since we are only dealing with stationary properties of the model , it is reasonable to assume that this parameter is associated to the divergence of the spatial correlation length and not to the temporal correlation length @xcite . in order to calculate the eigenvalue , @xmath74 , associated to that parameter",
    ", we have to find the linear region of the rg transformation .",
    "let us take a trajectory passing close enough to the unstable point , and construct a sequence of numbers consisting in the distance between two successive points along that trajectory .",
    "now , let us call @xmath75 to the ratio between two consecutive numbers in that sequence . in the portion of the trajectory corresponding to the linear region of the rg transformation ( around the unstable fixed point ) , one expects to see two plateaus in the values of @xmath75 .",
    "= 2.5 in    the first plateau corresponds to a trivial parameter , while the value of @xmath75 at the second plateau corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath74 of the rg transformation .",
    "figure ( [ ratios ] ) shows an example of one of such curves for the simple mean field approximation .",
    "so , figuring the eigenvalue @xmath74 associated to the relevant parameter , we get @xmath76 .",
    "the value measured numerically for the plot in figure ( [ ratios ] ) ( simple mean field approximation ) is @xmath77 .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the best value of @xmath0 is @xmath78 @xcite , and the most accurate value for the critical point @xmath79 , obtained by dynamical numerical simulations ( see following sections ) , is @xmath80 .",
    "although our value of the critical exponent @xmath0 is still inaccurate , it is worth at this point comparing it with the one obtained using the same approximation ( simple mean - field ) in @xcite . in that work",
    "the authors obtained @xmath81 , so that our result is a better approximation for the actual @xmath4 .",
    "our scheme is able to take into account correlations in a more accurate way than the original one .    by increasing the order of the approximation ,",
    "results improve , as shown in table ( [ lambdanu ] ) .",
    "the value we found using the two - site approximation was @xmath82 , while the value found in the four - site approximation was @xmath83 , which is closer to the actual one .",
    "below we show the critical value , @xmath73 , for the three approximations , as well as the corresponding value of @xmath74 and @xmath84 @xmath85    it should be noted that the present rg scheme leads to fairly good values for the exponent @xmath0 already within lower order mean - field approximations .",
    "this fact indicates that the introduction of new correlations in the transition probabilities plays a relevant role within the lower order mean - field approaches . for mean - field approximations of order higher than two ,",
    "the convergence of the scheme becomes slower .",
    "reconsidering the ideas which led us to eqs .",
    "( [ 12.even ] ) and ( [ 12.odd ] ) for the transition probabilities , one may think of obtaining better approximations for @xmath0 by allowing the transition probabilities to depend upon even more neighboring lattice sites . while this idea is clearly right",
    ", one can presently not overcome , in practice , the huge amount of computer time needed to obtain values that are accurate enough .",
    "the basic rules governing the dynamical evolution of the system have been formulated in section ii . as in ordinary cellular automata ,",
    "all lattice sites are updated simultaneously .",
    "simulations were performed on lattices of size @xmath86 , taking periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we briefly discuss here the scaling theory for directed percolation which supports the spreading analysis .",
    "a detailed treatment can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that for @xmath11 finite , the steady state of the system is meta - stable since , due to fluctuations of the stochastic process , there is always a finite probability for the system to become empty .",
    "this probability increases when approaching the critical point .",
    "consequently , it is very difficult to calculate critical points and critical exponents by means of numerical simulations .",
    "furthermore , since the transition between the stationary regime and the absorbing state is second order , a mean field treatment is not adequate .",
    "these shortcomings can be avoided by evaluating critical exponents related to the dynamic critical behavior of the system . for this purpose one",
    "starts , at @xmath87 , with a particle at the center of the lattice otherwise empty , i.e. a configuration very close to the absorbing state .",
    "then , the following quantities are computed : ( i ) the survival probability , @xmath88 , that is , the probability that at least a particle is still in the system at time @xmath27 ; ( ii ) the average number of particles , @xmath89 , and ; ( iii ) the average mean distance , @xmath90 , over which particles have spread .",
    "averages are taken over @xmath91 samples , and runs are performed up to @xmath92 .",
    "finite size effects are avoided , since the epidemic disk never reaches the edge of the lattice during the simulation .",
    "close to the critical point , and for long enough times , the following scaling laws should hold @xcite :    @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96 , @xmath97 gives the temporal correlation length close to @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the correlation length exponent ( time direction ) , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 are suitable scaling functions , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 are critical exponents . in the absorbing state ,",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 are expected to decay exponentially , since correlations are short - ranged .",
    "this can only happen if @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , one has from eq .",
    "( 4 ) :    @xmath108    at criticality , one expects that log - log plots of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 would give straight lines , while upward and downward deviations would occur even slightly off - criticality .",
    "this behavior would allow a precise determination of the critical point and the critical exponents @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "it should be noted that by means of eq .",
    "( [ short_range ] ) it would be also possible to calculate @xmath99 .",
    "as in standard second order phase transitions it is assumed that in the supercritical region , and close to the critical point , the system displays spatial correlations characterized by a typical length scale , @xmath109 , which diverges at criticality according to @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the correlation length exponent in the spatial direction .",
    "the natural order parameter of the model is the density of particles , @xmath112 , which at criticality depends on the system size @xmath11 and @xmath113 as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a suitable scaling function and @xmath116 is the order parameter critical exponent . for small positive @xmath113 , and @xmath117 , @xmath118 should have the following form @xmath119 in order to recover the well known critical behavior of the order parameter in the thermodynamic limit @xmath120",
    "before presenting the simulation results we will briefly discuss the critical point at @xmath121 . if we start at @xmath87 with a random initial configuration of density @xmath122 , the stationary density of the system is @xmath123 .",
    "it should be noted that at @xmath121 the system reaches a static stationary state in one time step ( see the evolution rules in table ( [ 2 ] ) ) .",
    "taking into account this observation , the stationary density of the system can be obtained as follows .",
    "it is clear from the evolution rules that the probability of having an occupied site at @xmath124 is equal to the probability of finding an occupied site surrounded by empty sites at @xmath87 .",
    "since there are no correlations in the initial state , the stationary density of the system at @xmath121 can be determined as @xmath125 then , since we used @xmath122 , the expected value of the stationary density is @xmath126 .    for arbitrary small values of @xmath72 ,",
    "the stationary state is the vacuum state @xcite .",
    "we now consider the relaxation process to the vacuum state .",
    "we take as starting configuration ( @xmath87 ) any of the static stationary states at @xmath121 . then , we follow the evolution of the density for @xmath72 close to zero .",
    "it is clear from the evolution rules that after a particle is created , two particles are removed from the system at the next time step . then , the system stays in another static state until the next creation process occurs .",
    "suppose that a creation process happens at position @xmath127 .",
    "if no new particle is created in the neighborhood of @xmath127 at the next time step , correlations can not be generated ( see the evolution rules in table ( [ 2 ] ) ) .",
    "the probability of two consecutive creation processes is @xmath128 .",
    "then , the system can not develop long range correlations and a mean field analysis should be appropriate . for @xmath72",
    "close to zero it is possible to consider the creation process as a creation - induced annihilation process .",
    "we then have @xmath129 consequently , @xmath121 is a trivial critical point since the relaxation time behaves as @xmath130 .",
    "this result is in disagreement with the one reported in reference @xcite , probably due to a poor statistics of the simulation data .    in the following",
    ", the results of the epidemics analysis at @xmath131 are presented .",
    "we measure the time evolution of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for different values of the parameter @xmath72 .",
    "log - log plots of these quantities as a function of time are straight lines at the phase transition and show curvature away from the transition .",
    "it is important to mention that the epidemics analysis is a very sensitive method since it is possible to distinguish among supercritical and sub - critical behavior for @xmath72 values that differ in the fourth decimal .",
    "our best estimation of the critical point is @xmath132 , and the dynamical critical exponents are @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "it should be remarked that the error bars merely indicate the statistical error obtained from regressions .",
    "the values of the dynamical exponents are in well agreement with those corresponding to directed percolation in ( @xmath5 ) dimensions , as it was expected .",
    "it is possible to calculate the exponent @xmath99 from the analysis of the sub - critical behavior ( see eq .",
    "( [ short_range ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , the decay constant , @xmath136 , governing the long time behavior of @xmath89 , behaves according to @xmath137 so , if @xmath138 is known , we can calculate @xmath139 for different values of @xmath113 .",
    "then , a log - log plot of @xmath139 vs @xmath113 allows us to evaluate the exponent @xmath99 .",
    "this analysis gives an exponent @xmath140 which is quite close to the value @xmath141 corresponding to ( 1 + 1 ) dp @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that our value of @xmath99 sharply differs from the one reported in reference @xcite ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the error in the last value of the exponent @xmath99 is due to the fact that it was calculated taking into account not only sub - critical , but also supercritical curves .",
    "we have also calculated the order parameter critical exponent measuring the density , @xmath112 , as a function of @xmath113 in the supercritical regime ( see eq.([beta ] ) ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath143 , which is once again very close to @xmath144 , corresponding to ( @xmath5 ) dp @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the reported value of the order parameter critical exponent in reference @xcite is @xmath145 which differs around @xmath146 from the theoretical value .",
    "this difference may be due again to the poor statistics of the data .",
    "we finally present the finite size scaling analysis .",
    "figure ( [ collapse ] ) shows a log - log plot of @xmath147 vs @xmath148 for different values of @xmath72 , and lattice sizes , @xmath11 , where we have used @xmath149 and @xmath150 @xcite corresponding to ( @xmath5 ) dp .",
    "we obtain an excellent collapse of the data on an universal curve , as it is predicted by eq .",
    "( [ universal ] ) .",
    "right before submitting this manuscript for publication , the author of reference @xcite improved some of his previous results @xcite .",
    "although no new results are reported for the trivial critical point @xmath151 , the conclusions concerning the universality class of the model are in complete agreement with the ones found in this work .",
    "we have introduced a new renormalization group algorithm for probabilistic cellular automata with one absorbing state .",
    "the new scheme introduces correlations in the rg procedure by allowing the transition probabilities to depend upon two neighboring lattice sites .",
    "three different approximations for the stationary probability distribution have been used , namely the simple mean - field approximation , the pair mean - field approximation , and the four - site mean - field approximation .",
    "the new rg scheme leads to fairly good values for @xmath111 even within mean - field approximations of low order .",
    "this result shows that the introduction of spatial correlations in the transition probabilities is the relevant reason for the improvement of the results .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath111 , specially for low order approximations , are better than the ones obtained with schemes that make use of an independent product of one - site transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "using very simple arguments , we have shown that @xmath14 is a trivial critical point , since the time relaxation constant behaves as @xmath152 .",
    "this behavior differs from the one reported in reference @xcite ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "we have also obtained , by means of numerical simulations , the critical point @xmath154 , and the whole set of critical exponents .",
