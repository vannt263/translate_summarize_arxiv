    "in contrast to other detection methods , like e.g. quantum point contacts ,",
    "the superconducting sets used here to monitor the node s charge state respond periodically to external potentials thus showing a specific response ( amplitude as well as direction ) depending on the set s working point .",
    "this is influenced by all potentials in close vicinity to the set island via capacitive coupling .",
    "in addition to the gates controlling the semiconducting part of the chip by applying voltages @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 we have evaporated gates close to each of the set islands ( referred to in the following as set gates with voltages @xmath118 ) which allow for the control of the set working points independently from any other potential in the circuit .",
    "the gate voltage @xmath118 is always the same for both set gates . a typical current response for both detectors under variation of @xmath118",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath116 and @xmath118 we now take a timetrace of the detectors current response to a specific pulse sequence ( see fig .  [ trace_raw ] ) : we first apply a short pulse to the gate @xmath117 between the node and the drain lead ( black vertical line ) which randomly changes the number of electrons stored on the node close to an equilibrium number . due to this pulse",
    ", we avoid the buildup of a strong electrostatic potential on the node which on the one hand would couple capacitively to the quantum dot ( mesoscopic feedback ) but would also potentially drive the sets out of sensitivity .",
    "after this first pulse , three combined capture and transfer pulses onto gate @xmath115 of the dynamic quantum dot are applied which are illustrated by green vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ trace_raw ] .",
    "all pulses are delayed by @xmath120 ms each .",
    "every timetrace consists of 279 sequence periods , i.e. 279 reset pulses and 837 combined capture and transfer pulses .",
    "next we describe an example of evaluating the trace shown in fig .",
    "[ trace_raw ] : we first make a histogram ( see fig .",
    "[ hist ] and [ trace ] ) of the first 175 sequence periods of the two time traces , then apply a second - order savitzky - golay filter in order to smooth the data and calculate the derivative ( black lines ) , which yields the maxima and minima of the histograms of the time traces .",
    "the maxima found correspond to the occupation levels of the node .",
    "the data range of the sets indicating the range of sensitivity is also derived from this calculation and is limited by the first and last minimum found by the algorithm .",
    "these either mark the vanishing separation of levels close to the set extrema ( lower limit for det1 ) or possibly insufficient occupation of the following levels for reliable detection ( upper limit for det1 , both limits for det2 ) .    the resulting levels are then compared to each mean value of the corresponding detector trace between two pulses .",
    "based on the assumption that each possible charge state of the node is found by the level detection ( which is supported by the stochastic reset of the node s charge number in each sequence ) we can directly extract the number of charge carriers between two pulses by counting the number of levels lying in - between the starting and the final level . whenever the starting or the final state is beyond these limits set by the algorithm ( i.e.",
    ", the set is not sensitive ) the corresponding event is not considered in the statistics .",
    "this evaluation is performed for every parameter set @xmath121 .",
    "the results are combined for such traces where @xmath116 is constant , both of the detectors are sensitive for at least 30% of the time and more than 150 equal events for both detectors have been observed .",
    "the last argument is based on the fact that both detectors are coupled to the same island and therefore the two signals are not independent but correlated in terms of electron number difference between two pulses . by applying this restriction we can strongly reduce the number of erroneous counts caused by noise on one of the detectors or by failures in the algorithm ( mainly errors in the level detection ) .",
    "all events or traces not matching these criteria , e.g. pulses at insensitive working points for at least one set or inequal results for both detectors , are neglected .",
    "therefore , the total number of events @xmath122 evaluated for one setting of @xmath116 varies from 1853 to 8997 events for @xmath123 $ ] mv ( average number of events @xmath124 ) .",
    "finally , this procedure results in a sequence of electron numbers captured and transferred by the pulses applied to the dynamic qd . for each @xmath116",
    "we count the number of outcomes @xmath125 that have resulted in exactly @xmath126 electrons captured and transferred in one cycle .",
    "@xmath125 is expected to obey the binomial distribution with the ( unknown ) success probability @xmath127 and the total number of trials @xmath122 .",
    "the probability @xmath0 is then estimated by definition as success frequency : @xmath128 .",
    "we have used the principle of maximal likelihood and the quantile function of the binomial distribution to estimate the ( symmetric ) @xmath129 confidence intervals for @xmath0 , as depicted by error bars in fig .  3 and 4 .",
    "for the special outcomes of @xmath130 and @xmath131 the confidence interval is estimated by requesting the expected probability of this extremal outcome to be no less than @xmath132 .    for the best - fit estimation of parameters of the models expressed by eq .",
