    "the standard cosmological model is based on the idea of inflation as driven by a single slowly - rolling scalar field whose primordial quantum fluctuations are responsible for both cmb perturbations and the large scale structures of the universe  @xcite .",

    "the degree of deviation from this smooth background is provided by the temperature fluctuations of the cmb which are of the order of @xmath3 and are almost scale - independent  @xcite .",
    "the standard inflationary scenario predicts the observed power spectrum of cosmic fluctuations . on the other hand , there is still a lot of room for alternative scenarios without ruining the current agreement with observations .",
    "alternatives include , for example , multifield models  @xcite , the curvaton scenario  @xcite and theories with non - canonical lagrangians as k - inflation  @xcite , dbi inflation  @xcite or ghost inflation  @xcite .",
    "so far , observations have not provided us with the precision measurements which would allow to discriminate among all these different models , but new projects , such as the planck  @xcite satellite which was just launched , can potentially reach the levels of precision necessary for this purpose .",
    "one important feature of the cmb anisotropies to be decoded is the degree of non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "a random field is defined as gaussian if all the information is contained in its two - point correlation function . in single - field ,",
    "slow - roll inflation the level of non - gaussianity is very small since the connected parts of higher order correlation functions are proportional to powers of the slow - roll parameters  @xcite .",
    "if a larger non - gaussianity will be detected in the future , this could then rule out the minimal model .",
    "recently another alternative to the standard inflationary scenario has attracted some attention where primordial vector fields play a non - negligible role during inflation  @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility is that these extra fields might be responsible for generating an observable level of non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "this is not the only motivation to consider such models .",
    "first of all vector fields are present in particle physics models and that suggests that one has to include them in a theory of the early universe .",
    "this can be done without necessarily affecting current observations , for example keeping their contribution to the energy density of the universe way below the one from the inflaton . however , a peculiarity of the vector fields , which the scalar fields do not possess , is to violate rotational invariance as some observations seem to suggest .",
    "violation of rotational invariance would affect the correlation functions introducing some degree of statistical anisotropy .",
    "the power spectrum is constrained in this sense if a single preferred direction of space is involved  @xcite .",
    "this is something to keep in mind for example when constucting models of vector inflation .",

    "nevertheless , the presence of the vector fields introduces statistical anisotropy in the power spectrum and in the bispectrum as well  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no observational constraints are currently available for the two - point function if more than one preferred direction is involved .",
    "similarly , for higher order correlators , no obervational constraints of this kind are available . + the effects of a primordial vector field on the power spectrum and bispectrum of the curvature fluctuations @xmath4 were recently investigated in  @xcite using the @xmath1 formalism  @xcite both in vector inflation and in the vector curvaton models , and also in @xcite for a model of hybrid inflation .",
