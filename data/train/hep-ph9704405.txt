    "semileptonic @xmath0-meson decays have been studied for some time now .",
    "the inclusive decays @xmath6 with @xmath7 representing @xmath8 or @xmath9 and @xmath10 any possible hadronic final state containing a charm quark ( @xmath11 ) or an up quark ( @xmath12 ) , provide information on both couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as well as new information on the internal structure of the @xmath0-meson . in this paper",
    "we study the electron energy spectra . for the theoretical description of the electron spectra in eq.(1 ) , strong interactions in the underlying weak decays must be incorporated , since they are responsible for the confinement of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "they will be included in two steps : as bound state effects and also in the form of gluons radiated during the decay .    for inclusive",
    "@xmath0-meson decays , it was recognized that extended regions of phase space involve large values of @xmath15 , the momentum transfer squared , originating from the large mass of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "consequently the commutator of the two currents describing the decay is dominated by distances close to the light  cone . in this case",
    "it is justified to replace the commutator of the weak currents by their light ",
    "cone singularity times a bilocal operator in @xmath1-quark fields [ 13 ] .",
    "this replacement together with standard mathematical methods leads to general expressions of the decay spectra which involve a @xmath1-quark distribution function , whose origin is non  perturbative .",
    "thus the semileptonic decays in eq.([eq : pro1 ] ) can be described , in direct analogy to deep inelastic scattering , in terms of a quark distribution function , which depends on a new scaling variable @xmath16 .",
    "it has also been recognized that the heavy quark field can be studied in an effective field theory derived from the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) sets a framework for keeping track of the heavy quark mass dependence and for parametrizing nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "the effective theory has been successfully applied to inclusive @xmath0 decays [ 412 ] . using the operator product expansion and the method [ 57 ] of the hqet , it was possible to derive sum rules for the distribution function , which depend on the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic energy of the @xmath1-quark in the @xmath0-meson .",
    "the numerical values for the sum rules are determined by static properties of @xmath0 mesons and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the sum rules specify the mean value and the variance of the distribution function .",
    "they imply that the distribution function @xmath17 peaks at large values of @xmath18 and is very narrow .",
    "in addition radiative qcd corrections must be included .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections to the electron energy spectra were computed [ 1418 ] at the quark level . in the quark decay",
    "the phase space ends at the electron energy @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the masses of the @xmath1-quark and the final quark , respectively .",
    "the quark decay rates as well as the radiative corrections vanish for @xmath22 , whereas in reality the physical endpoint is @xmath23 with @xmath24 the mass of the @xmath0-meson and @xmath25 the minimum value of the invariant mass of the hadronic final state .",
    "in addition , the @xmath26 radiative corrections at the quark level have logarithmic singularities at the endpoints . for inclusive decays , however , we integrate over the phase space of the final quark and average over the momentum distribution of the initial quark in order to incorporate the bound state effect .",
    "these steps sum over ensembles of states , render the radiative corrections finite @xcite and extend the phase space from the quark level to the hadron level .    in this way we have at our disposal a coherent treatment of perturbative and nonperturbative qcd effects .",
    "this treatment has the advantage of accounting correctly for the phase - space effects and producing the electron energy spectra which are smooth everywhere up to the physical endpoints .",
    "for instance , the spectrum is a smooth function of the electron energy @xmath27 in the endpoint region between the @xmath3 endpoint @xmath28 gev and the @xmath2 endpoint @xmath29 gev , which is useful for extracting @xmath30 since only the @xmath31 transition is allowed in this region .    for the sake of completeness we present in section 2 the general formalism for inclusive semileptonic b",
    ". then we show in section 3 that the light - cone dominance leads to an expression for the decay rate in terms of a distribution function . in these two sections ,",
    "we point out how the general formula in eq.(7 ) reduces to eq.(24 ) .",
    "properties of the distribution function are discussed in section 4 where they are quantified by the heavy quark effective theory . in section 5",
    "we propose a method for including the qcd radiative corrections to bound states . with the above formalism",
    "we calculate and analyse , in section 6 , the electron energy spectra .",
    "the inclusive semileptonic decays ( [ eq : pro1 ] ) , in which the @xmath0 meson of four - momentum @xmath32 decays into an electron of four - momentum @xmath33 and an antineutrino of four - momentum @xmath34 , are described by the decay amplitude @xmath35 here @xmath36 are the elements of the ckm matrix and @xmath37 is the weak current , which in terms of quark fields is given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the b - meson state normalized according to @xmath40 .",

    "the unknown hadronic structure resides in the functions @xmath53 .",
    "it is well known that integrals like the one in eq.([eq : comm2 ] ) are dominated by distances where @xmath54 for inclusive semileptonic b - meson decays ( [ eq : pro1 ] ) , @xmath15 is timelike and varies in the physical range @xmath55 for extended regions of phase space the momentum transfer squared satisfies @xmath56 with @xmath57 . in these regions",
    "we expect the dominant contribution to the integral in eq.([eq : comm2 ] ) to come from distances of the current commutator close to the light - cone .",
    "the commutator in this region is in fact singular leading to the dominant contribution @xmath58 |b\\rangle   = 2(s_{\\mu\\alpha\\nu\\beta } -i\\varepsilon_{\\mu\\alpha\\nu\\beta } )    \\left [ \\partial^{\\alpha}\\delta_q(y ) \\right ] \\langle b|\\bar{b}(0 )      \\gamma^{\\beta}(1-\\gamma_5)b(y)|b\\rangle\\ , , \\label{eq : domin3}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the pauli ",

    "the last factor with the reduced matrix element contains the long - distance contribution .",
    "the product of those two factors is lorentz covariant and can be calculated in any lorentz frame of reference .",

    "it is in general a function of two scalars @xmath61 and @xmath62 and can be expanded in powers of @xmath61 : @xmath63 we shall keep the first term of the series because the higher order terms are suppressed by powers of @xmath64 .",
    "this approximation is justified provided the coefficients are not very large .",

    "we have shown that the dominance of the light  cone makes possible the expression of the decay rate in terms of a quark distribution function defined in eq.([eq : distr3 ] ) .",
    "a special consequence of the decay kinematics is the occurrence of two roots in the argument of the @xmath76-function in eq.([eq : tensor3 ] ) , namely @xmath77 we shall elaborate on this property below .",

    "the second root , @xmath80 , is a straightforward consequence of the analysis and corresponds to the creation of quark  antiquark pairs through the @xmath81-diagram because the energy of the final quark is negative .",

    "the first one expresses the @xmath1 quark number conservation @xcite @xmath88 performing the operator product expansion to reduce the bilocal operator to local ones and following [ 57 ] in order to expand the matrix element of the local operator in the hqet , two more sum rules were derived .",
    "they determine up to order @xmath89 the mean value @xmath90 and the variance @xmath91 of the distribution function , which characterize the position of the maximum and its width , respectively : @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "the first matrix element @xmath97 parametrizes the chromomagnetic energy arising from the @xmath1 quark spin and is determined by the mass splitting between @xmath98 and @xmath0 mesons [ 57 ] . for the observed difference @xmath99 gev @xmath100 the second matrix element @xmath101 parametrizes the kinetic energy of the @xmath1 quark in the b meson .",
    "it is determined with the help of qcd sum rules and carries a larger error , leading to the result @xcite @xmath102 taking @xmath103 gev , the mean value and the variance of the distribution function are estimated to be @xmath104 @xmath105 indicating that the distribution function is sharply peaked around its mean value , which is close to one .",
    "these results are consistent with the original expectations that the distribution function of a heavy quark peaks at a large value of its argument .",
    "special attention must be paid to the radiative corrections from the emission of gluons and the associated virtual diagrams .",
    "qcd radiative corrections to the electron energy spectra were studied in several articles [ 1418 ] , where they were calculated at the quark level . as already mentioned in the introduction , in the application of radiative corrections at the hadron level we encounter two problems :",
    "the first is to change the quark phase space to the physical one and the second is the treatment of the logarithmic singularities to order @xmath106 , which appear at the quark - level endpoints @xmath107 .    these problems may be solved by taking into account the bound state effect . in the decay of a @xmath0-meson",
    ", the perturbative qcd correction will be modified by the bound state effects , since qcd confinement implies that free quarks are not asymptotic states of the theory .",
    "the bound state effect is described by the @xmath1-quark distribution function given in eq.([eq : distr3 ] ) , which is the probability of finding a @xmath1 quark with momentum @xmath108 inside the @xmath0-meson .",
    "the substitution of the @xmath1 quark momentum @xmath109 by @xmath108 introduces the hadronic phase space .",
    "furthermore , the radiative corrections obtained perturbatively must be convoluted with the distribution function . the final contribution for the radiative corrections",
    "is given by @xmath110 where the quark - level @xmath26 perturbative qcd correction @xmath111 was computed analytically in @xcite . in this way the endpoints of the perturbative spectra are extented from the quark level to the hadron level and the logarithmic singularities are eliminated .",
    "as we shall see , the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative qcd effects is important , especially for the shape of the @xmath31 electron energy spectrum near the endpoint",
    ".    we could give at this point formulas for the radiative corrections at the quark level , but since they are available in two articles @xcite we refer to them .",
    "the interested reader may consult these articles and use their formulas for @xmath111 which occurs in eq.(34 ) .",
    "an important property of eq.(34 ) is that the integral over @xmath112 eliminates the logarithmic singularities .    in order to calculate the decay spectra",
    "we need a distribution function @xmath17 consistent with the properties of section 4 .",
    "we propose the ansatz @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the normalization constant and @xmath115 and @xmath1 two parameters . in case @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    ", this distribution function reduces to a delta function , @xmath118 , and thus reproduces the free - quark decay model .",
    "in addition , the constraints ( [ eq : constrain1 ] ) and ( [ eq : constrain2 ] ) , stemming from the hqet , limit the two constants @xmath115 and @xmath1 .",
    "other forms of the distribution function have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we use eqs.([eq : triple3 ] ) , ( [ eq : rad5 ] ) and ( [ eq : ansatz6 ] ) to compute the electron energy spectra for @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "the calculation is done using ( [ eq : triple3 ] ) by integrating first over @xmath119 and then over @xmath15 with the integration limits @xmath120 @xmath121 for practical calculations we take @xmath122 on the assumption of quark - hadron duality .",
    "the parameters which enter in the calculation are the final quark mass @xmath21 , the parameters @xmath115 and @xmath1 ( or the equivalent quantities : the mean value @xmath90 and the variance @xmath91 ) of the distribution function and the strong coupling constant @xmath106 .",
    "an important feature is the appearance in the decay rates of the physical @xmath0-meson mass instead of the @xmath1 quark mass .",
    "the necessity of taking into account the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative qcd effects on both @xmath3 and @xmath2 spectra is discussed above . here",
    "we illustrate in fig.1 that this interplay is important especially in the endpoint region of the @xmath2 spectrum . the radiative correction calculated with the help of eq.([eq : rad5 ] )",
    "is a smooth function of the electron energy up to the physical endpoint ( solid curve ) .",
    "the other two curves show the quark - level perturbative correction without and with the sudakov exponentiation @xcite , respectively .",
    "radiative corrections without the sudakov exponentiation run off to infinity with increasing energy as expected .",
    "the sudakov exponentiation eliminates the singularity and gives a decay rate finite up to the quark - level endpoint @xmath123 . beyond this value",
    "the correction is zero . for our case ,",
    "the radiative correction , shown in fig.1 , remains finite all the way up to the physical endpoint @xmath124 .",
    "the property that the averaging over a variable of the initial quark renders the radiative corrections finite is general and can be applied in other approaches as well .",
    "for example , radiative corrections to the analyses @xcite can be easily included using our prescription .",
    "having at our disposal a coherent treatment of perturbative and nonperturbative qcd effects , we study the sensitivity of the shape of the spectrum to various parameters .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we use eqs.(24 ) , ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) to compute the spectra .",
    "more precisely , we integrate eq.(24 ) over @xmath119 and @xmath15 and then add the qcd radiative correction from eq.(34 ) to obtain the radiatively corrected electron spectrum .",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum is shown in fig.2 as a function of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is evident that the spectrum is much more sensitive to the mean value @xmath90 of the distribution function than its variance @xmath91 .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is insensitive to the values of the mass of the final quark @xmath125 and the strong coupling constant @xmath106 .",
    "the effect of the radiative corrections on the spectrum is shown in fig.3 where we have chosen two values of @xmath126 ( solid curve ) and @xmath127 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the effect of the radiative correction is moderate .",
    "we study next the dependence of the shape of the electron energy spectrum for the @xmath3 decay on various parameters .",
    "in addition to the previous parameters , the mass of the charm quark plays now a role .",
    "we show in fig.4 the electron spectrum as a function of @xmath128 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is a sensitive function of the mass of the charm quark @xmath128 and of the mean value @xmath90 .",
    "it is rather insensitive to the variance @xmath91 . in fig.5",
    "we show the electron spectrum with and without radiative corrections .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath3 spectrum is insensitive to the value of @xmath106 .        with the parameters determined",
    "so far we can calculate the @xmath3 spectrum and compare it with the recent experimental data from the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "we present the result in fig.6 , where the theoretical curve has been boosted to the rest frame of the @xmath129 resonance .",
    "the values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 are still consistent with the sum rules in eqs.([eq : constrain1 ] ) and ( [ eq : constrain2 ] ) .",
    "this is a direct calculation of the spectrum and not a @xmath132 fit .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is good .",
    "the above analyses indicate the sensitivity of the spectral shape to various parameters and imply that a detailed fit to the measured spectrum can impose strong constraints on the mean value of the distribution function and the mass of the charm quark .",
    "this procedure will reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of the semileptonic decay width of the @xmath0-meson @xcite and improve the accuracy of the predictions for the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "precise determinations of @xmath133 and @xmath30 may be gained from inclusive semileptonic @xmath0-meson decays .",
    "finally , the same tensor structure appears in the decay @xmath134 @xcite and a universal fit of both processes would be of interest .",
    "dedicated studies of the inclusive b decays will also offer more insight into the internal structure of hadrons .",
    "we would like to thank r. poling and r. wang for kindly providing us with their data on inclusive b decays and p. soldan for reading the paper .",
