    "<S> the report describes the research program on the development of ultra - low - energy germanium detectors , with emphasis on wimp dark matter searches . </S>",
    "<S> a threshold of 100  ev is achieved with a 20  g detector array , providing a unique probe to the low - mas wimp . </S>",
    "<S> present data at a surface laboratory is expected to give rise to comparable sensitivities with the existing limits at the @xmath0 wimp - mass range . </S>",
    "<S> the projected parameter space to be probed with a full - scale , kilogram mass - range experiment is presented . </S>",
    "<S> such a detector would also allow the studies of neutrino - nucleus coherent scattering and neutrino magnetic moments .    as - texono/07 - 05 +    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp , denoted by @xmath1 ) are the leading candidates for cold dark matter ( cdm )  @xcite , and supersymmetric ( susy ) particles are the favored wimp candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the popular susy models prefer wimp mass ( @xmath2 ) of the range of @xmath3100  gev , though light neutralinos remain a possibility  @xcite . simple extensions of the standard model with a singlet scalar favors light wimps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most cdm experiments optimize their design in the high - mass region , and have diminishing sensitivities for @xmath4 , where there is an allowed region if the dama annual modulation data are interpreted as wimp signatures  @xcite . to probe this low - mass region , detectors with sub - kev threshold are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> these low - threshold detectors will also open the window to look for wimps bound in the solar system  @xcite , as well as non - pointlike susy candidates like q - balls  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sensitivity to sub - kev energy presents a formidable challenge to detector technology and to background control . </S>",
    "<S> so far , only the cresst - i experiment have derived exclusion limits  @xcite with sapphire(@xmath5)-based cryogenic detector at a threshold of 600  ev .    </S>",
    "<S> a research program in low energy neutrino and astroparticle physics is pursued  @xcite by the texono collaboration at the kuo - sheng(ks ) reactor laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> a scientific goal is to develop advanced detectors with kg - size target mass , 100  ev - range threshold and low - background specifications for wimp searches as well as for the studies of neutrino - nucleus coherent scatterings  @xcite and neutrino magnetic moments ( @xmath6 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ks laboratory is located 28  m from a 2.9  gw reactor core and has an overburden of about 30  meter - water - equivalence  ( mwe ) . </S>",
    "<S> its facilities are described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the @xmath6-studies with a 1.06  kg germanium detector ( hpge ) at a hardware threshold of 5  kev were reported . </S>",
    "<S> this hpge has also been used for the studies of reactor electron neutrons  @xcite as well as searches for reactor axions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental procedures were well - established and the background above 12  kev were measured . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a background level of about @xmath7(cpd ) comparable to those of other underground cdm experiments was achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> `` ultra - low - energy '' germanium ( ulege ) detectors , developed originally for soft x - rays detection , are candidate technologies to meet the challenges of probing into the unexplored sub - kev energy domain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these detectors typically have modular mass of 5 - 10  grams </S>",
    "<S> . detector array of up to n=30 elements have been successfully built , while there are recent advances in developing single - element ulege of kg - size mass  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various prototypes based on this detector technology have been constructed . </S>",
    "<S> depicted in figure  [ fe55 ] is the measured energy spectrum due to external @xmath8fe calibration sources  ( 5.90 and 6.49  kev ) together with x - rays from ti  ( 4.51 and 4.93  kev ) , ca  ( 4.01  kev ) , s  ( 2.46  kev ) and al  ( 1.55  kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> random trigger events uncorrelated to the detector provided the zero - energy pedestals . </S>",
    "<S> pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) criteria were applied as illustrated in figure  [ psd ] by correlating two output with different electronics amplifications and shaping times . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic noise edge was suppressed by psd and a threshold of 100  ev was achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations of the low energy spectra of the selected events from a flat distribution gave the efficiencies of the psd cuts .     </S>",
    "<S> pulse shape discrimination : correlations of signals with different electronic amplifications and shaping times lead to suppression of the noise edge . ]     </S>",

    "<S> low - background data were taken at ks under the same shielding configurations as the magnetic moment experiments  @xcite , using a 4-channel ulege detector each having an active mass of 5  g. the recorded spectrum with 0.34  kg - day of data after cosmic - rays and anti - compton vetos and psd selection is displayed in figure  [ bkgspect ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that comparable background level was achieved as the cresst - i  @xcite experiment with 1.51  kg - day of data . </S>",

    "<S> intensive efforts on the data analysis are underway . the projected sensitivities with 1  kg - year of data at 100  ev threshold and a 1  cpd background level are shown .     expected spin - independent sensitivity region for cdm searches using a ulege detector with a mass of 1  kg at 1  cpd background level . also shown are the present exclusion boundaries  @xcite and the dama allowed regions  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> background understanding at the sub - kev range is a challenging and unexplored subject in its own right . </S>",
    "<S> external background is expected to be reduced due to self - shielding effects in a kg - mass detector , as well as by additional active veto ge layers enclosing hermetically the ulege inner target  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies are under way with a 180-g segmented ulege prototype equipped with a veto ring and dual - readout channels from both the signal and high - voltage electrodes . a 500-g detector similar to the design demonstrated in ref .  </S>",
