    "over a decade ago , slonczewski @xcite and berger @xcite predicted that an electrical current induces a torque on the magnetization of a ferromagnetic metal , and subsequent research has since identified distinct contributions called the reactive spin transfer torque and the dissipative spin transfer torque , sometimes referred to as adiabatic and non - adiabatic , respectively .",
    "@xcite progress on the understanding of this effect in metals has been steady , @xcite and the field has been stimulated by applications in spintronics and nanotechnology , as a way to manipulate magnetization and thus information .",
    "current - induced spin torques arise from a small mismatch between the spin polarization of conduction electrons and the magnetization present throughout a material , and reflect the nonlocal nature of magnetization dynamics in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "@xcite they are the converse of processes such as giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) .",
    "the calculation of spin torques is equivalent to finding the conduction - electron spin density in an electric field , and in metals they can be easily expressed as the divergence of the spin current . @xcite",
    "recently spin torque - related effects have been investigated in metal - based systems and nanomagnets , e.g. , spin - torque driven ferromagnetic resonance , @xcite spin torques in nanomagnets @xcite and in continuously variable magnetizations , @xcite the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction in inhomogeneous ferromagnets , @xcite current - induced magnetization dynamics , @xcite and domain wall motion .",
    "@xcite    despite these efforts , spin torques have been little studied in materials displaying some of the richest physics and technological promise , namely ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "the most intensely studied ferromagnetic semiconductors are mn - doped iii - v compounds , which fall into two classes : zincblende lattices , such as ( ga , mn)as and wurtzite lattices , such as ( ga , mn)n . the former have been much investigated @xcite and will be the subject of this work , while the latter are awaiting further experimental developments .",
    "@xcite recent experiments have succeeded in fabricating ( ga , mn)as spin transfer torque devices , @xcite while domain wall motion @xcite and resistance @xcite have been addressed , and spin transfer physics was the subject of a recent review .",
    "@xcite    ferromagnetic semiconductors differ profoundly from ferromagnetic metals .",
    "being @xmath2-type , the carriers are holes described by an effective spin-3/2 and subject to a strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the hole spin is thus not conserved .",
    "the band hamiltonian is the luttinger hamiltonian , @xcite which , in the spherical approximation , is composed of a series of multipoles in spin space . @xcite the hole spin is a dipole , while the spin - orbit interaction is a quadrupole , and the precession of the spin in a quadrupole field is highly nontrivial .",
    "@xcite magnetism is due to localized mn moments , with the exchange interaction mediated by itinerant holes . in the mean - field approximation",
    "this interaction is taken into account as an effective field ( a dipole ) acting on the carriers and produces a splitting comparable in magnitude to the fermi energy .",
    "@xcite the combined effect of this dipole exchange field and the quadrupole spin - orbit interaction is not a simple additive problem .",
    "@xcite these materials are often in the weak momentum scattering limit , @xcite i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fermi energy and @xmath5 is a characteristic scattering time .",
    "due to the fast spin precession as a result of the spin - orbit interaction the relaxation time approximation is inappropriate to describe spin dynamics .",
    "the carrier spin is not conserved which introduces arbitrariness in the definition of the spin current .",
    "@xcite therefore , spin torques can not be identified , as in metallic systems , @xcite with the divergence of the spin current . finally electrically - induced spin densities @xcite in bulk nonmagnetic zincblende semiconductors are forbidden by symmetry , raising the question of what form the spin density may take in such a system when the symmetry is lowered by the magnetization .    in this paper",
    "we present a general theory of current - induced spin torques in zincblende iii - v ferromagnetic semiconductors , which , to our knowledge , is the first of its kind .",
    "our study is based on the luttinger hamiltonian @xcite and it assumes @xmath6 , a time - independent magnetization with small spatial gradients , zero temperature , no compensation and short - ranged impurity potentials ( justified by the large carrier densities in ferromagnetic semiconductors and the short - range nature of the exchange interaction @xcite ) .",
    "we take the spin - orbit interaction to be the _",
    "dominant _ term and treat the exchange field in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "this is a good approximation for the lower end of mn concentrations ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we neglect also quantum interference effects such as weak localization .    in recent years a number of microscopic theories of spin torques in ferromagnetic metals have been developed .",
    "@xcite a common strategy is to begin with a uniformly magnetized state and consider small perturbations around it .",
    "the method used in this work is slightly different , although the physics is the same and no difference is expected in the final results .",
    "we assume a magnetization that is a function of position and has small gradients , and we work to first order in the gradient of the magnetization .",
    "we would like to note that a recent study has been published which considers spin torques in metals starting from a spin continuity equation .",
    "@xcite    the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the next section contains a derivation of the kinetic equation that will be used in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we begin from the quantum liouville equation and project it in momentum space , then introduce so - called wigner coordinates and derive the equation satisfied by the wigner distribution . in section iii this equation is solved in the presence of an electric field , and in section iv the spin density induced by the electric field is found , which gives the spin torque acting on the magnetization .",
    "the form and implications of the results are discussed , and their applicability to gamnas is demonstrated .",
    "finally , the domain wall velocity as a result of the spin torque is estimated in sec .  [",
    "sec : dws ] .",
    "the typical setup for a spin torque experiment consists of two slabs of ferromagnetic material with non - collinear magnetizations , separated by a tunnel barrier .",
    "since the magnetizations of the two slabs are non - collinear there is a region near the interface over which the magnetization changes . to determine the continuum limit of this setup one can begin by visualizing a large number of slabs put together , with slight variations in the direction of the magnetization of each slab .",
    "then one can imagine the interfaces between the slabs disappearing , leaving one large sample with an inhomogeneous magnetization , in such a way that the gradient of the magnetization varies little over distances comparable to the lattice spacing .",
    "the gradient expansion in the magnetization that follows from this procedure is valid as long as the length scale on which the magnetization varies is much longer than the relevant length scales of the carriers , i.e. , the fermi wavelength and mean free path .",
    "spin torques appear when an electrical current flows through such a material . in a ferromagnetic semiconductor the magnetization is a result of the mn ions which interact by means of the exchange coupling mediated by itinerant holes .",
    "the holes themselves have a spin polarization , and in equilibrium the hole spin polarization follows the magnetization .",
    "when an electrical current flows through the sample one can think for example of a hole which is taken from position @xmath8 , where its spin is parallel to the local magnetization at @xmath8 , and transporting it to @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetization at @xmath10 is slightly different from the magnetization at @xmath8 , so a torque is exerted by the itinerant hole on the magnetization .",
    "what makes the situation in ferromagnetic semiconductors more difficult and more interesting is that while the hole is moving from @xmath8 to @xmath10 it is subject to the strong spin - orbit interaction , which acts to randomize its spin . in order to determine the effect of spin - orbit interactions , which are wave vector - dependent , on the itinerant holes and",
    "ultimately on the inhomogeneous magnetization we need to study the kinetic equation , which takes into account both the momentum dependence and the position dependence .    in this section",
    "we will derive a kinetic equation suitable for describing inhomogeneous ferromagnetic semiconductors in an electric field .",
    "we consider the system to be described by a density operator @xmath11 , which obeys the quantum liouville equation @xmath12 = 0.\\ ] ] the total hamiltonian @xmath13 contains contributions due to the band hamiltonian @xmath14 , the scalar impurity potential , the exchange interaction between delocalized holes and localized mn moments , and the electric field .",
    "these will be given below .",
    "the liouville equation is projected onto a set of states @xmath15 of definite wave vector @xmath16 and spin @xmath0 , which are assumed to be bloch functions and eigenstates of the luttinger hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath17 in this basis are @xmath18 and are treated as matrices in spin space .",

    "the term proportional to the luttinger parameter @xmath22 gives the hole kinetic energy .",
    "for @xmath23 , the term proportional to @xmath24 separates the heavy hole ( hh ) and light hole ( lh ) states , i.e. , it is the spin - orbit coupling that plays a central role in the present analysis .",
    "the mn@xmath25 ions give rise both to a net magnetic moment , through the hole - mediated exchange interaction , and to scattering , which has a scalar part and a spin - dependent part .",
    "these are contained in the hamiltonian @xmath26 , @xmath27,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over the positions @xmath28 of the mn@xmath25 ions , with @xmath29 the mn spin .",
    "we approximate the interactions represented by @xmath26 as short - ranged , so that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the exchange constant between the localized mn moments and the itinerant holes , and @xmath33 the sample volume .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath26 in the basis @xmath34 are decomposed into a part @xmath35 diagonal in @xmath16 , which gives the net magnetization @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of mn@xmath25 ions and we assume all mn spins polarized setting @xmath39 , and a part off - diagonal in @xmath16 , which causes spin - dependent scattering and will be given below .",
    "we will concentrate in this work on the case in which the exchange splitting is smaller than the spin - orbit coupling at the fermi energy , i.e. , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the fermi wave vector , and we work to first order in @xmath42 .    in studying inhomogeneous magnetization",
    "one must account for real - space as well as wave - vector dependence , which is accomplished by defining a wigner distribution .",
    "the wigner function corresponding to the one - particle density matrix @xmath43 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the next step is to derive an equation describing the time evolution of the wigner distribution @xmath47 .",
    "the kinetic equation for the wigner function @xmath48 is obtained by projecting the quantum liouville equation onto the basis states @xmath49 , then making the transformation ( [ eq : wigin ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 is diagonal in wave vector .",
    "the first step , in which no approximations have been made , gives us the liouville equation in terms of the so - called wigner coordinates @xmath50 and @xmath51    @xmath52    to obtain a transparent kinetic equation it is necessary to expand @xmath53 around the wave vector @xmath50 , which requires some care . in this article",
    "we are working in a basis in which the functions depend on the wave vector @xmath50 , and we require a formulation of the kinetic equation that is manifestly gauge covariant .",
    "this means that the kinetic equation should not acquire additional terms if the basis functions are subjected to a @xmath54-dependent rotation .",
    "the end result of this requirement is that ordinary @xmath50-derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives ( @xmath8-derivatives , denoted by @xmath55 , remain unchanged since the basis does not have position dependence . )",
    "the covariant @xmath54-derivative is defined by @xmath56 $ ] , where the gauge connection matrix @xmath57 .",
    "all this implies that in our derivation we must replace the ordinary derivatives by covariant derivatives .",

    "nevertheless it must be borne in mind that the carrier occupies a finite range of real and momentum space , denoted by @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively , which are determined in such a way as to be consistent with the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "in the course of a scattering event in which a carrier with wave vector @xmath50 interacts with the potential of an impurity and its wave vector changes from @xmath50 to @xmath71 , it is necessary as well as physical to assume that the wave - vector spread @xmath70 associated with the carrier size is m !",

    "it is straightforward to check that this form of the wigner function satisfies the kinetic equation ( [ eq : equikineq ] ) when the rhs is equal to zero .",
    "the form of his solution shows that in equilibrium the spin polarization of the holes follows the magnetization of the mn , which is contained in the exchange part of the hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "next , in the linear response regime , we search for a solution of the kinetic equation for nonzero @xmath85 , which will yield the spin density induced by @xmath74 .",
    "since the spin density induced by the electric field will be a function of position and will in general not be parallel to the local magnetization , this will immediately give the spin torque exerted by the conduction holes on the magnetization . the method we use to solve the kinetic equation is as follows .",

    "the steady - state solution for @xmath98 therefore involves only a straightforward time integral of the kind customarily encountered in linear - response theories .",

    "less than in metals , but @xmath73 itself is also typically one order of magnitude smaller .      the fact that the spin torque comes only from @xmath134 implies that the steady - state spin density is due to precession under the action of both the spin - orbit interaction and the exchange field .",
    "the fraction of the spins that is conserved , which would yield a term @xmath151 , gives a contribution that averages to zero in momentum space .",
    "the quantities @xmath138 and @xmath139 decrease with increasing spin - orbit interaction ( given by @xmath24 ) , suggesting the spin - orbit interaction reduces the spin torque .",
    "this agrees with the finding that there is no electrically - induced spin density in the corresponding nonmagnetic systems , @xcite i.e. in the limit of large spin - orbit interaction @xmath152 .",
    "this limit is equivalent to restoring the spherical symmetry of the luttinger hamiltonian of eq.([eq : hlutt ] ) , which in ferromagnetic semiconductors is broken by the magnetization .",
    "an important difference from ferromagnetic metals is that , in eq.([eq : torque ] ) , there is no contribution from scattering , either scalar or spin - dependent .",
    "this fact indicates that the dominant spin torque in ferromagnetic semiconductors in the weak momentum scattering limit is intrinsic .",
    "this observation agrees with the results of jungwirth _",
    "et al_. , @xcite who studied the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnetic semiconductors in the regime @xmath3 and found similarly that the role of scattering is secondary .",
    "it is also related to the absence of electrically - induced spin polarization in bulk nonmagnetic zincblende materials .",
    "generally , such a spin polarization is due to the fraction of spins that is conserved @xcite and is linear in @xmath5 , but this spin polarization is forbidden by symmetry in zincblende lattices . @xcite the magnetization breaks the cubic symmetry of the lattice and gives a steady - state spin density , but the term linear in @xmath5 still averages to zero .",
    "we come back to the comparison of our result with result found for ferromagnetic metals in the next section .",
    "we find that an electric field @xmath153 corresponds to the permutation @xmath154 in eq.([eq : torque ] ) .",
    "yet for a given orientation of @xmath74 , unlike in ferromagnetic metals , in ferromagnetic semiconductors there is no symmetry between the different components of the spin density for the following reason . in metals spin",
    "is conserved and spin torques can be derived phenomenologically directly from the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( the so - called _ book - keeping _ argument @xcite ) .",
    "one assumes an itinerant spin passes a localized moment at @xmath8 , lines up with it , then moves on to another moment at @xmath10 and exerts a torque on this moment .",
    "this relates @xmath155 to @xmath156 and gives a simple vector - product form for @xmath157 .",
    "@xcite in ferromagnetic semiconductors the spin - orbit interaction acts to randomize the itinerant spin moving between @xmath8 and @xmath10 , and there is no simple relationship between @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "such a book - keeping argument is thus not valid and there is no symmetry in the final expression for the spin density .",
    "we would like to comment on one last aspect of the relationship between the hole spin polarization and the magnetization in ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "the calculation presented in this work relies on a mean - field description of the magnetization and hole spin polarization . in this picture",
    "the itinerant holes are subject to an average magnetic field due to the mn@xmath25 ions , and the mn@xmath25 ions in turn are subject to the itinerant hole spin polarization , which can also be regarded as an average magnetic field.@xcite since it is assumed that the spin - orbit interaction has spherical symmetry , there is no easy axis for the magnetization in the absence of an electric field . however , once the electric field is applied it is natural to ask whether the direction of the electric field provides an easy axis for the magnetization , in other words whether the magnetization in the direction of the electric field increases .",
    "we find that this indeed is true , but the increase in the magnetization is second order in the ratio @xmath160 and is not significant .    in ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "in which spin - orbit coupling is negligible , angular momentum is conserved . as a result spin torques in these materials can be encapsulated into a set of simple , compact , rotationally - invariant vectorial expressions . in ferromagnetic semiconductors ,",
    "in which spin - orbit interactions are usually the dominant energy scale , angular momentum is not conserved and the final expressions for the spin torques can not be expected to have rotational invariance . in principle",
    "spin - orbit interactions , which couple the spin and the lattice , should give magnetic anisotropy and anistropic spin torques as well .",
    "the anisotropy in our result for the spin density is thus a direct result of the intrinsic spin - orbit interactions .",
    "we shall assume a doping density @xmath161 , corresponding to @xmath162 , @xmath163 mev nm@xmath164 as discussed in ref .",
