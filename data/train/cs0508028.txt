    "a number of compute intensive applications often suffer from bursty usage patterns  @xcite , whereby the demand for it , memory and bandwidth resources can at times exceed the installed capacity within the organization .",
    "this problem can be addressed by providers of it services who satisfy this peak demand for a given price , playing a role similar to utilities such as electricity or natural gas .",
    "the emergence of a utility form of it provisioning creates in turn a number of problems for both providers and customers due to the uncertain nature of it usage . on the provider side",
    "there is a need to design appropriate pricing schemes to encourage the use of such it services and to gain better estimates of the usage pattern so as to enable effective statistical multiplexing . on the customer side",
    ", there needs to be a simple way of figuring out how to anticipate and hedge the need for uncertain demand as well as the costs that it will add to the overall it operations .",
    "recently , it was proposed to use swing options for pricing the reservation of it resources @xcite . by purchasing a swing option",
    "the user pays an upfront premium to acquire the right , but not the obligation , to use a resource as defined in the option contract . as with the case with electricity ,",
    "it resources , such as bandwidth and cpu time , are non - storable and with volatile usage pattern .",
    "thus , swing options provide flexibility in both the amount and the time period for which a resource is purchased , making them appealing to users whose bursty demand is hard to predict . from the point of view of the providers , if enough users purchase these options providers can offset the cost of providing peak capacity by multiplexing among many users .",
    "pricing a swing option for it resources however , turns out to be difficult because of the complexity of the option contract and the lack of a good model of the spot market price , which at present is nonexistent . moreover , there are two important problems that need resolution .",
    "first , the user needs to be able to estimate the amount of resources that need to be reserved as well as their cost ; and second , the provider needs to put in place a mechanism that will induce truth revelation on the part of the user when stating the likelihood that a given reservation or option will be exercised .    as was shown in @xcite , the first problem can be addressed by providing the user with a simulation tool for estimating the cost of a reservation from a set of historical data , as well as a provision for entering the user s assumptions about aggressive or conservative swings . because the prices for swings are set ahead of time and not by market forces , the forecasting tool also provides a powerful `` what - if '' capability to both the resource provider and the customer for estimating outright costs and risks associated with fluctuations in customer demand .    as to the provider s problem with asymmetric information",
    ", it could be argued that a user s historical usage pattern allows to predict his future demand .",
    "but in many cases , such as with new users , the data may not be available or reflect unanticipated user needs .",
    "even worse , users may misrepresent the likelihood of their needs in order to gain a pricing advantage , with the consequent loss to the provider . in the original design of the swing option",
    "this was addressed by introducing a time dependent discount that induces early commitment to a contract . but this strategy still allows users to misrepresent their likelihoods the first time they buy an option .",
    "this paper presents a solution to the truth revelation problem in reservations by designing option contracts with a pricing structure that induces users to reveal their true likelihoods that they will purchase a given resource .",
    "a user is allowed to adjust his option later if his likelihood changes .",
    "truthful revelation helps the provider to plan ahead to reduce the risk of under - utilization and overbooking , and also helps the users to save cost .",
    "in addition to its truthfulness and robustness , the mechanism extracts revenue similar to that of a monopoly provider monopoly provider practicing temporal pricing discrimination with a user population whose preference distribution is known in advance @xcite .    we start by presenting a simple two period model in which at the first period the user knows his probability of using the resource at the second period and purchases a reservation whose price depends on that probability . a coordinator",
    "then aggregates the reservations from all users and purchases the needed resources from the provider .",
    "these resources are then purchased in the second period .",
    "a nonlinear pricing scheme is shown to lead to both truthful revelation and profitability to both users and coordinator .",
    "we then extend the two period model to a multi period model which allows the user s likelihoods of use to change over time . in this more realistic scheme ,",
    "users are allowed adjust their options according to updated information about their needs while remaining truthful at each time period .",
    "finally we show how this truth - telling reservation mechanism can be interpreted in terms of standard options terminology , and finish with a discussion of the feasibility of this mechanism to provide revenues to both users and providers .    while the focus of this paper is on reservations for it resources ,",
    "there are many other interesting situations where our mechanism can be useful .",
    "for example , conference rooms in many organizations tend to be reserved in advance in the likelihood that they will be needed for future meetings .",
    "the resulting behavior leads to serious inefficiencies through reservations that are not exercised and which force others to reschedule important meetings . a truth telling mechanism like the one we propose would lead to a more efficient scheduling of such conferences . likewise , airline seats , hotel reservations , network bandwidth and tickets for popular shows would benefit from a properly priced reservation system , leading to both more predictable use and revenue generation .",
    "consider @xmath0 users @xmath1 who live for two discrete periods .",
    "each user may need have to consume one unit of resource in period 2 , which he can buy from a resource provider either in period 1 at a discount price @xmath2 , or in period 2 at a higher price @xmath3 . in period 1",
    ", each user @xmath4 only knows the probability @xmath5 that he will need the resource in the next period .",
    "it is not until period 2 that he can be certain about his need ( unless @xmath6 or @xmath2 ) .",
    "we also assume that the distributions of the users needs are independent .",
    "suppose all the users wish to pay the least while behaving in a risk - neutral fashion .",
    "user @xmath4 can either pay @xmath2 in period 1 , or wait until period 2 and pay @xmath7 if it turns out he has to , an event that happens with probability @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , he will use the former strategy when @xmath8 and the latter strategy when @xmath9 , while his cost is @xmath10 .",
    "this optimal paying plan can be very costly for the user .",
    "for example , when @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the user always postpones the decision to buy until period 2 , ending up paying @xmath13 for every unit he needs .    in what follows",
    "we describe a reservation mechanism that allows him to pay a small premium that guarantees his one unit of resource whenever he needs it in period 2 , at a price not much higher than the discount price @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the mechanism makes the user truthfully reveal his probability of using the resource to the provider , who can then accurately anticipate user demand . at a later stage ,",
    "we show how this mechanism can be thought of as an option .      to better illustrate the benefit of this mechanism , we introduce a third agent , the coordinator , who aggregates the users probabilities and makes a profit while absorbing the users risk .",
    "he does so in a two period game , which we now describe .    1",
    ".   ( period 1 ) the coordinator asks each user to submit a probability @xmath14 , which does not have to be the real probability @xmath5 that the user will need one unit of resource in period 2 . 2 .   ( period 1 )",
    "the coordinator reserves @xmath15 units of resource from the resource provider ( at the discount price ) , ready to be consumed in period 2 .",
    "( period 2 ) the coordinator delivers the reserved resource units to users who claim them . if the amount he reserved is not enough to satisfy the demand , he buys more resource from the provider ( at the higher unit price @xmath7 ) to meet the demand .",
    "( period 2 ) user @xmath4 pays @xmath16 where @xmath17\\to \\mathbb r^+$ ] are two functions whose forms will be specified later .",
    "these terms are completely transparent to everyone , before step 1 .    for the coordinator to profit , the following two conditions have to be satisfied :    the coordinator can make a profit by providing this service .",
    "each user prefers to use the service provided by the coordinator , rather than to deal with the resource provider directly .",
    "the next two truth - telling conditions , although not absolutely necessary , are useful for conditions a and b to hold .",
    "( step 1 truth - telling ) each user submits his true probability @xmath5 in step 1 , so that he expects to pay the least later in step 4 .",
    "( step 3 truth - telling ) in step 3 , when a user does not need a resource in period 2 , he reports it to the coordinator .    from condition t1 .",
    "user @xmath4 expects to pay @xmath18 in period 2 .",

    "note that @xmath52 is strictly decreasing , a feature essential for the user to be truth - telling .",
    "a user with a high @xmath50 is more likely to pay the upper curve rather than the lower curve . knowing this , he has an incentive to submit a high probability of use and thus not to cheat .",

    "his probability @xmath50 can then be inferred from his choice ( using eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) or ( [ eq : g ] ) ) .",
    "this alternative method may be more user - friendly because people tend to be more sensitive to monetary values rather than probabilities .",
    "we can even further simplify the curve by providing the user with a table with the values of a few discrete points along the curve .",
    "simple as it may seem , the two period model can already solve a wide range of reservation problems .",
    "here we show how the mechanism can be extended to solve more nontrivial problems , as when there is uncertainty not only in the consumption of one unit , but also in both the number of consumption units and their consumption time .",
    "( uncertain number of units ) by checking past web statistics , a company discovers that its website has the following pattern of visits : 90% of the days it needs one unit of bandwidth , 6% of the days two units , 3% of the days three units , only 1% of the days does it need four units of bandwidth .    here",
    "the company faces a four - point distribution of usage rather than a two - point distribution ( either 1 or 0 ) discussed in the two period model .",
    "imagine there are four units of resources : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the company s usage pattern can be written as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . breaking down to individual unit ,",
    "the pattern is @xmath64 ( for sure one unit will be consumed ) , @xmath65 ( with probability 0.1 the company will need at least two units ) , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "thus , to efficiently reserve bandwidth for some day in the future , the company can reserve one unit for sure , and buy three options , all for the same day , with @xmath12 , 0.04 , and 0.01 respectively .",
    "( uncertain consumption time ) a biochemist will need for sure to use a public supercomputer to run some cpu - heavy simulations next month , but he has no idea on which day he will need it .",
    "he wants to reserve the supercomputer now to save cost .",
    "say that the next month has 30 days .",
    "the probability that he will need the computer on one particular day next month is @xmath68 .",
    "he can buy 30 `` @xmath68 '' options , one for each day next month . for a numerical calculation ,",
    "assume that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "his total expected cost would then be @xmath71 so he pays less than 2 for an uncertainty over 30 days , which is not bad .",
    "the careful reader might notice that in example 1 , the @xmath72 s are no longer independent , whereas in example 2 , the consumptions on two different days are not independent either .",
    "this is not really a problem , because although the options reserved by one user can be dependent , as long as the options reserved by different users are independent , lemma [ lm : conda ] still works .",
    "in the previous 2-period mechanism , if a user learns more in time about the likelihood of his needing the resource , it is impossible for him to modify the original contract . to solve this issue",
    "we extend our mechanism so that the user can both submit early for a larger discount and update his probability afterwards to a more accurate one .",
    "we thus consider a dynamic extension of the problem in which the user is allowed to change his probability of future use some time after his initial submission .",
    "assume that everyone lives for three periods . in period 3",
    "the user might need to consume one unit of resource .",
    "he can either reserve one unit in period 1 at price 1 , or in period 2 at a price @xmath3 , or buy it in period 3 at price @xmath73 .",
    "assumption is not essential .",
    "we could have assumed @xmath74 instead and the main result of this section will continue to hold , just that the maths would become considerably messier . ]",
    "the additional period 2 is introduced to exploit the user s information gaining process . in order to make this meaningful we need to carefully define the information structure , especially what does `` gain more information '' mean .",
    "suppose that each user can end up in either state @xmath75 or state @xmath76 in period 2 .",
    "when in period 1 , the user knows his probability of entering each of the two states ( @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) , but he does not know exactly which state he will enter until after period 2 . in this sense , we say that the user `` gains '' an extra bit of `` state information '' in period 2 .",
    "his probability of consuming one unit of resource in period 3 actually depends on his state and will thus report a more accurate probability once he gets the `` state information '' .    the information structure for three periods . ]",
    "this information structure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : info - struct-3p ] .",
    "the user enters state @xmath75 with probability @xmath77 and state @xmath76 with probability @xmath78 .",

    "if he enters state @xmath76 , he will need the resource with probability @xmath80 .",
    "he knows these probabilities @xmath81 at the beginning .",

    "he will finish the paper before the deadline , and there is 0.6 probability that it will get accepted .",
    "if he can not finish it before the deadline , he can still submit a post - deadline paper , which will only be accepted with probability 0.2 .",
    "he will be informed whether his paper is accepted some time after his submission .",
    "he is thinking of booking a plane ticket now .",
    "the three periods are jan 1 , feb 1 and apr 1 .",
    "the probabilities are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85",
    ".    we should distinguish between the concepts of _ error _ and _",
    "uncertainty_. for example , by repeatedly tossing an unfair coin we can estimate its probability more and more accurately , but even if we know its exact probability distribution we still do not know what the outcome would be for the next time .",
    "that is , by maintaining a large history we can reduce _ error _ but not _",
    "uncertainty_. in our information structure we assume that the user knows his accurate probabilities ( no error ) . in this context information is defined in the `` uncertainty elimination '' sense , rather than in the `` error elimination '' sense .",
    "again we describe a mechanism used by a coordinator to make profit by aggregating the user s uncertainty . a user may submit a probability in period 1 , as in the 2-period setting .",
    "additionally , when he enters period 2 he is allowed to update his probability based on his new information gained at that time . this way the user can enjoy the full discount while simultaneously utiize maximum information .",
    "his final payment in period 3 is determined by the one or two probabilities he submitted .",
    "the whole mechanism is described more rigorously as follows .    1 .   ( period 1 )",
    "the user may submit a probability @xmath86 , which is suggested but not obligatory to be the real probability @xmath87 that he will need one unit of resource in period 3 .",

    "4 .   ( period 2 ) the coordinator adjusts his holdings to match the new probability @xmath88 .",
    "( period 3 ) if the user claims the need of one unit of resource , the coordinator delivers one reserved unit to him .",
    "if his reservation pool is not large enough , he buys more resource from the provider ( at the higher unit price @xmath73 ) to meet the demand .",

    "the columns represent his three possible submission patterns . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we thus conclude that the truth - telling mechanism is particularly efficient for reservations of peak demands and rare events ( small @xmath50 ) .",
    "in this paper we presented a solution to the truth revelation problem in reservations by designing option contracts with a pricing structure that induces users to reveal their true likelihoods that they will purchase a given resource .",
    "truthful revelation helps the provider to plan ahead to reduce the risk of under - utilization and overbooking .",
    "in addition to its truthfulness and robustness , the scheme can extract similar revenue to that of a monopoly provider who has accurate information about the population s probability distribution and uses temporal discrimination pricing .",
    "this mechanism can be applied to any resource that exhibits bursty usage , from it provisioning and network bandwidth , to conference rooms and airline and hotel reservations , and solves an information asymmetry problem for the provider that has traditionally led to inefficient over or under provision .",
    "we first presented a simple two period model in which at the first period the user knows his probability of using the resource at the second period and purchases a reservation whose price depends on that probability .",
    "a coordinator then aggregates the reservations from all users and purchases the needed resources from the provider .",
    "these resources are then delivered in the second period . in this case",
    ", we showed how a nonlinear pricing scheme leads to both truthful revelation on the part of the users and profitability to both users and providers .",
    "we then extended the two period model to a multi period model , thus allowing for the user s likelihoods of exercising the options to change over time . in this more realistic scheme , users are allowed adjust their options according to updated information about their needs while remaining truthful at each time period .",
    "finally we showed how this truth - telling reservation mechanism can be interpreted in terms of standard options terminology , and concluded that in general it performs better than direct selling , especially for peak - like demands .",
    "this approach can be extended in a number of ways so as to become useful in a number of realistic situations . with the addition of a simulation tool developed in the context of swing options  @xcite , for example",
    ", users can anticipate their future needs for resources at given times and price them accordingly before committing to a reservation contract .",
    "yet another extension would allow for the reservation of single units of a resource ( airline seats or conference rooms , for example ) over a time interval , as opposed to a particular date .",
    "given the rather inefficient way through which most bursty resources are now allocated , we believe that this mechanism will contribute to a more useful and profitable way of allocating them to those who need them , while giving the provider essential information on future demand that he can then use to rationally plan its provisioning .",
