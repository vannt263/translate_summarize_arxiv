    "dynamic correlation functions are directly probed in spectroscopic methods , and describe the transport , optical , magnetic and wider electronic structure properties of materials . as such , their accurate computation is highly sought after .",
    "however , few robust approaches exist for strongly correlated materials@xcite .",
    "the difficulty is in simultaneously requiring both an accurate treatment of the electron correlations beyond mean - field density functional or low - order perturbation theory for the ground state _ and _ excitation spectrum , as well as modeling a system of sufficient size to reach the thermodynamic limit and avoid spurious finite size effects . in general ,",
    "only mean - field electronic structure methods are computationally cheap enough to access the required system sizes , and so there is a pressing need for methods with mean - field computational scaling , which can correctly describe the excitation spectrum in strongly correlated materials .",
    "a zero - temperature dynamic correlation function can be defined in the frequency domain as @xmath0 with the one - particle green functions defined with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being single annihilation / creation operators with appropriate time - ordering .",
    "spectral functions are then defined as @xmath3 $ ] , where the spectral broadening is given by the small imaginary component of the energy , @xmath4 , which regularizes the correlation function .",
    "the single particle density of states , experimentally measured by scanning tunneling or photoemission spectroscopy , is the spectral function of the one - particle green function .",
    "two - particle spectral functions are also highly sought after , such as the two - hole propagator probed with auger spectroscopy@xcite , or the particle - hole green function that gives the optical conductivity , polarizability and magnetizability , and are key descriptors in raman spectroscopy and the mechanism of high-@xmath5 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "one method which has revolutionized the computational description of strongly correlated spectral functions is dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft , or cluster - dmft for a multi - site extension)@xcite . in dmft , a single unit cell ( or site ) in the bulk is viewed as a quantum impurity , described by its local , one - particle green function , and is self - consistently embedded with a non - interacting self - energy ( hybridization ) from its environment .",
    "the quantum impurity problem is then solved via an ` impurity solver ' , such as continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc)@xcite or exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite . a success of the approach is that the non - trivial physics in the limit of a high dimensional system can be solved exactly , as the correlated corrections to the green function are then local . however , there are some formal drawbacks of the dmft formulation .",
    "the essential problem is that dmft maps the infinite bulk onto a quantum impurity plus infinite bath problem , which while obviously far simpler , is still numerically challenging to solve .    if ct - qmc is used as an impurity solver to integrate over this infinite bath ( or indeed general quantum monte carlo approaches in isolation ) , then spectral functions are obtained only on the imaginary frequency axis , requiring unstable analytic continuation onto the real frequency axis , which can wash out subtle or sharp features of the spectra@xcite .",
    "accessing low temperatures or arbitrary interactions produces fermion sign problems , which can require millions of computer - hours to stabilize , even for a modest number of impurity sites . on the other hand ,",
    "exact diagonalization suffers from bath discretization error in the spectra due to the need for a second , approximate mapping of the hybridization ( at all frequencies ) to a representation by a finite number of bath sites with frequency independent energies and couplings@xcite .",
    "in addition , since dmft is formulated via the dyson equation on the one - particle green function , other spectra such as the two - particle green function and optical spectra are difficult to obtain , formally requiring expensive vertex corrections@xcite . other methods to calculate spectra of correlated extended systems , such as the dynamical density matrix renormalization group@xcite or perturbative methods@xcite are often limited to certain correlation strengths , system sizes or spatial dimensions .    here",
    ", we avoid many of these issues , by extending the idea of quantum embedding of _ wavefunctions _ rather than green functions , to compute general dynamical correlation functions .",
    "the framework , which we term density matrix embedding theory ( dmet ) was introduced for embedding of ground state wavefunctions in ref .  , with extensions to long - range hamiltonians and broken symmetry ground states found in refs .",
    "the essential idea for static quantities is that the schmidt decomposition of a mean - field bulk state defines a manifestly _ finite _ quantum impurity mapping : for a cluster of @xmath6 impurity sites there are ( at most ) @xmath6 bath sites .",
    "the mapping is exact in the non - interacting and local limits , similar to dmft , but has no bath discretization error .",
    "furthermore , because it is a mapping to a finite quantum problem , it is orders of magnitude cheaper numerically to solve the resultant quantum system , while the accuracy of dmet compares very favorably ( and can exceed ) that of dmft .    here , we show that for dynamic quantities , the schmidt decomposition of a mean - field bulk response vector yields a similar finite quantum impurity mapping that renders _ spectra _ exact in the non - interacting and local excitation limits .",
    "this ` spectral dmet ' possesses advantages compared to dmft . the finite quantum impurity mapping results in numerically simple calculations of spectral functions ( no frequency point in these results took more than a minute on a single computing core ) , while eliminating bath discretization error of dmft+ed calculations .",
    "in addition , since the method is formulated in terms of a general response vector , it is not restricted in the type or rank of perturbing operators that it can consider , with two - particle green functions available within the same framework at a comparable computational cost to the single particle green functions .",
    "a major contrasting feature of the approach compared to dmft+ed is that the bath space and couplings change continuously with frequency , which is a major factor in the compactification of the bath .",
    "this frequency - dependent bath space can then exactly represent the entanglement between the impurity and its environment at a given frequency , as defined by a global mean - field response function .",
    "furthermore , since this bath is not fit and can be algebraically constructed based on real frequency values , direct evaluation of the correlated spectral function on the real frequency axis is straightforward .",
    "the approach will be demonstrated for the hubbard model , defined by the hamiltonian in the site basis as @xmath7 this is one of the key unresolved models in the electronic structure of correlated materials , encapsulating the competing effects of kinetic energy and coulomb repulsion , which can give rise to correlation driven phase transitions and the mott ",

    "we compare to one - dimensional exact results from the bethe ansatz@xcite , as well as benchmark 1d and 2d cluster dmft calculations at half - filling and under doping@xcite . in addition",
    ", we compute local two - particle green functions .",
    "we first recap the dmet quantum embedding formalism introduced for the ground state to familiarize the approach and enable similarities with the spectral adaptation to be emphasized , with more details provided in ref .   and .",

    ", @xmath12 takes the form of a set of single particle states multiplied by a determinant of the states remaining in @xmath13 which are rendered uncoupled via @xmath8 to the impurity space by the procedure .",
    "the interacting quantum impurity plus bath hamiltonian is constructed by projecting @xmath14 into this basis of @xmath15 as @xmath16 , with @xmath17 .",
    "this space spans the exact entanglement of the impurity to its environment within @xmath9 , and is now independent of the total number of sites in the system . to avoid double counting of correlation effects ,",
    "@xmath18 is defined as the fully - interacting @xmath14 over the impurity , while the one - particle @xmath19 is used over the rest of the space .",
    "@xmath20 is solved for the wavefunction over the quantum impurity and bath , @xmath21 .",
    "5 .   a one - particle , hermitian potential defined over the impurity space , @xmath22 ,",
    "is obtained in order to match the elements of the one - body density matrix of @xmath9 and @xmath21 .",
    "this interaction potential mimics some of the longer - ranged correlation effects , and controls the effective number of particles on the impurity cluster .",
    "this defines the new one - particle lattice hamiltonian , @xmath23 ( where @xmath22 is periodically repeated across the lattice ) , from which the process can be repeated until self - consistency .",
    "static , local expectation values are defined as @xmath24 , while non - local expectation values , such as the energy for the impurity cluster , can be defined through a partial trace of the density matrices with the hamiltonian , as defined in ref .  .",
    "we now generalize to dynamic quantities .",
    "this requires the construction of a set of frequency - dependent bath states , into which the interacting dynamic response equations are projected .",
    "this procedure exactly embeds the local spectrum in the response of the entire ( formally infinite ) lattice , as defined by a response vector , @xmath25 constructed from the one - particle hamiltonian , @xmath19 .    1 .",
    "the one - particle response vector is obtained from the solution to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the response operator relating @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "however , @xmath21 can be reoptimized in the larger space of @xmath40 ( which also fully spans the space of the original ground state wavefunction , included when @xmath41 ) .",
    "however , this was found not to qualitatively change the results , and so @xmath42 and @xmath43 are taken to be the ground - state wavefunction and energy in the original quantum impurity and bath space of @xmath15 .",
    "the final spectral function is obtained as @xmath44 .",
    "there are a number of points to note about the above construction . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves here to consider _ local _ spectral functions , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both closed operators within the space of @xmath45 .",
    "the set of operators @xmath33 include the unit operator .",
    "this ensures that the space of the ground - state dmet is included within @xmath40 .",
    "the rest of the @xmath33 operators define frequency - dependent bath states , which may not always be orthogonal , but nonetheless exactly ` span ' @xmath25 throughout the lattice .",
    "this ensures that the spectral functions are exact in the @xmath46 non - interacting limit , where @xmath19 , and therefore @xmath25 are also exact . away from this limit , @xmath25 also changes , due to the presence of the interaction potential @xmath22 in the one - particle hamiltonian , which includes local interaction effects of the extended system .",
    "in addition , @xmath47 is also exact for uncoupled , local excitations within the impurity cluster , due to the completeness of the impurity space @xmath10 included in @xmath40 .",
    "one missing feature of the above construction is that the self - consistent potential @xmath22 , is not updated as a function of frequency , @xmath48 .",
    "this is appropriate at low energies , where the component of the ground state in the response function is large , but not at higher energies , as discussed further below .",
    "the exactness of the non - interacting and local limits is a feature that this construction shares with dmft , but there are important properties which dmft does not possess .",
    "the coupling to the environment is achieved via a set of bath states , which change continuously with frequency , and which couple the impurity space to the set of non - local excitations given by the spectrum of @xmath49 for the frequency considered . in contrast , dmft+ed constructs bath states which are frequency - independent , and whose size must be formally infinite in order to avoid a discretization error which is not present in the above _ algebraic _ bath construction . furthermore , dmft is formulated in terms of the one - particle green function , but the procedure outlined above is suitable for general operators @xmath1 of any rank .",
    "a key point of the approach is that the analytic construction of the bath states which exactly span @xmath25 , is no more costly than the diagonalization of the one - particle hamiltonian .",
    "once the fully interacting response is projected into this basis , there is no dependence on the size of the underlying lattice , rendering the cost of the method truly mean - field scaling with the size of the system .",
