    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , sheets made from various materials constrained at one edge by an imposed sinusoidal profile spontaneously develop a hierarchical pattern of folds or wrinkles . at first sight , as quoted by numerous authors  @xcite , these patterns consist of a hierarchy of successive generations of folds whose typical size gradually increases along @xmath2 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we propose to rationalize these various hierarchical patterns by considering the evolution of the average wavelength , @xmath1 , with the distance to the constrained edge , @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> to the best of our knowledge , the experimental characterization of these patterns had not been carried out before .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming inextensibility of the sheet along the @xmath8 direction , the imposed undulation along this direction exactly compensates for an effective lateral compression of the membrane by a factor @xmath9 defined as , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the curvilinear and projected width of the curtain , respectively , and @xmath13 is the out - of - plane deformation of the sheet . at any position along the @xmath2 axis , </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath13 is typically sinusoidal along @xmath8 , with an amplitude @xmath14 and a wavelength @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the inextensibility hypothesis along the @xmath8 axis imposes @xmath16 at the lowest order , where the lateral compression is assumed to be constant throughout the length of the curtain . </S>",
    "<S> the undulations of the sheet along @xmath8 are characterized by a curvature @xmath17 whose typical value , varying along @xmath2 , is of order @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energy per unit area , @xmath19 , for bending the membrane is thus of order @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the young modulus and @xmath22 the thickness of the sheet . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath23 , the membrane adopts the largest possible wavelengths , in order to minimize energy . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency to increase the wavelength , combined with the constraint imposed at the boundaries , is the source of the observed hierarchical wrinkling pattern .    </S>",
    "<S> inspired by previous models based on successive period - doubling transitions  @xcite , we consider that the allometric laws mentioned above can be derived by considering that the global pattern results from the self - assembly of building - blocks which we denote _ wrinklons_. a single wrinklon corresponds to the localized transition zone needed for merging two wrinkles of wavelength @xmath1 into a larger one of width @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this transition requires a distortion of the membrane which relaxes over a distance @xmath25 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> each wrinklon is characterized by a size , @xmath25 , which depends on the material properties and on the wavelength @xmath1 . to investigate the properties and behavior of wrinklons , we have performed model experiments using thin plastic sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the sheets were constrained with sinusoidal clamps : two opposite edges are constrained by a wavelength @xmath1 ( amplitude @xmath26 ) and @xmath24 ( amplitude @xmath27 ) , respectively , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a , b . the normalized size of the wrinklons , @xmath28 , is plotted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> * c * , evolution of the normalized length of a wrinklon , @xmath28 , with the normalized amplitude , @xmath29 ( fixed wavelength , @xmath34 mm ) for different thicknesses as indicated . ]    in a further step , the wrinklons can be assembled to mimic the behavior of a complete hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if @xmath25 is the distance over which the wavelength increases from @xmath1 to @xmath24 , its variation , @xmath35 , is thus of order @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the evolution of @xmath1 as a function of the distance from the constrained edge , @xmath2 , is given by @xmath37 considering the scaling @xmath31 deduced from the single wrinklon experiments , equation  ( [ eq : defldlambdadx ] ) indicates that the wavelength along the sheet should evolve like @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent agreement between this power law and the experimental data measured for light sheets ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) provides a strong support to the concept of wrinklons as building - blocks . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : defldlambdadx ] ) can now be regarded as a tool that connects the properties of single wrinklons to the features of the full wrinkling - cascade pattern .    </S>",
    "<S> we now focus on the description of an elementary building block . for confined thin sheets , </S>",
    "<S> stretching deformations are costly as compared to pure bending . </S>",
    "<S> the sheet tends to adopt an isometric ( developable ) shape  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the only developable solutions compatible with boundary conditions generally include flat domains surrounded by edge or point - like singularities </S>",
    "<S> . these singularities , which focus the elastic energy into narrow regions , have been classified as developable cones  @xcite , ridges  @xcite , or curved ridges  @xcite . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the scenario is however significantly different : in contrast to crumpling , stretching is smoothly distributed in the transition zone as pointed out recently in numerical simulations of deformed membranes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary stretching required for connecting the periodic patterns can be illustrated by a simple origami model made with a sheet of paper ( see supp . </S>",
    "<S> info . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stretching energy can be estimated through the elongation strain of the sheet along @xmath2 within a transition domain . </S>",
    "<S> the typical value of the strain along @xmath2 is of order @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the average slope of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the stretching energy thus reads @xmath41    as observed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , wrinklons should also include a tip singularity ( a small region where gaussian curvature is large ) . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity can be described as a semi - circular fold of radius @xmath42 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of these singularities has been derived by pogorelov  @xcite in a study of deformed shells . in our context </S>",
    "<S> , the energy of such curved folds reads @xmath43 where the radius at the tip of the wrinklon is taken as @xmath44 as suggested by the roughly parabolic shape of the crest of the defect ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the ratio of the curved fold energy to the stretching energy of the wrinklon , @xmath45 , is very small in our experiments : the effect of this concentrated region can therefore be neglected in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of a wrinklon , of characteristic area @xmath46 , is thus given by @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the size of a single wrinklon is finally obtained by minimizing @xmath48 with respect to @xmath25 , yielding @xmath49 this scaling emerges from a balance between bending and stretching energies and was previously reported for other situations , such as the decay length of an imposed curvature in a sheet  @xcite or the extension of a pinch in a pipe  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling for the wavelength describing the whole hierarchical pattern is obtained by integration of equation  ( [ eq : defldlambdadx ] ) with @xmath50 given by equation  ( [ eq : llambda32 ] ) and is found to be @xmath51 the scaling law , @xmath38 , is in very good agreement with the observed power laws for light curtains , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ made of fabric or paper sheets ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to yielding the proper exponent , this relation enables the comparison of the data obtained from seemingly disparate systems , over a wide range of lengthscales and independently of material properties . figure  [ fig4]a provides a remarkable collapse of the evolutions of the wavelengths measured with light curtains and various thin plastic sheets .    </S>",

    "<S> heavy curtains , made from fabric or rubber , and constrained graphene bilayers do not follow this behaviour ( instead , they obey @xmath57 ) . in these experiments , </S>",
    "<S> an additional tensile force is acting on the sheet . </S>",
    "<S> this tension , @xmath58 , is given by the longitudinal tensile strain induced by thermal manipulation in the case of graphene sheets  @xcite and by gravity for heavy curtains ( @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath22 , and @xmath62 are the density of the curtain , the gravity constant , the thickness and the height of the curtain ) . </S>",
    "<S> these systems can also be compared to the cascade of wrinkles observed for compressed thin polystyrene films on an air - water interface  @xcite since the surface tension of water at the free edges pulls the thin sheet .    </S>",
    "<S> the tension exerted along @xmath2 per unit width , imposes an additional stretching energy given by @xmath63 and becomes dominant when @xmath64 , that is when @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of the distorted membrane thus becomes @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the length of a wrinklon found from the minimization of @xmath67 is @xmath68 similar relations , reflecting a balance between tension and bending energies , were previously proposed for single wavelength patterns in stretched sheets and heavy curtains  @xcite . as expected , the tensile force increases the length of wrinklons for a given wavelength  @xcite . by integration of equation  ( [ eq : defldlambdadx ] ) with @xmath50 given by equation  ( [ eq : llambda2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the corresponding spatial evolution of the wavelength along a heavy sheet @xmath69 this scaling is in excellent agreement with the power laws observed for heavy curtains and graphene bilayers , ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data of various macroscopic curtains , graphene bilayers and nanometric polystyrene indeed collapse onto a single master curve without any fitting parameters ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism is thus validated from hundreds of nm for graphene sheets to meters for rubber and fabric curtains , which shows the universality of our description . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between the stretching and tension regimes can be obtained by comparing the relations ( [ eq : lambdax23 ] ) and ( [ eq : lambdax12 ] ) . the critical distance from the edge at which this transition occurs </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> in gravity dominated systems , the tension @xmath71 , gives the typical curtain length @xmath72 above which tension dominates . </S>",
    "<S> curtains shorter than @xmath73 ( about 1 m for our fabric ) were used to observe the regimes dominated by stretching (  light sheets \" ) , whereas the top part of longer curtains were used for experiments concerning  heavy sheets \" .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that the self - similar patterns observed in sheets constrained at one edge can not be described with d - cone or ridges singularities . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , they can be built by stitching together building - blocks , called wrinklons characterized by a diffuse stretching energy . </S>",
    "<S> the self - similar structure is then related to the size of these wrinklons that depends on material properties and the local wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we also show that these building - blocks can be readily manipulated through the size and energy cost of a single wrinklon by applying a tension . for large values of tension </S>",
    "<S> , we even expect a transition towards a purely cylindrical pattern along the sheet with a single wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we can draw a parallel between this study and the previously reported fractal buckling of torn plastic sheets  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the imposed metric indeed determines the three - dimensional shape of the distorted membrane , characterized by a superimposition of various modes . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the patterns observed here for constrained thin sheets exhibit a continuous evolution of the wavelength .    </S>",
