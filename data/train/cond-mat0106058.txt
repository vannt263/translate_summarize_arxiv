    "in spite of its fundamental and technological interest , there is as yet no general theoretical framework to predict the final microstructure of a solid following changes in temperature or stress across a structural transition@xcite .",
    "this is in part because most experimental studies have focussed on technologically important solids which are far - from - idealized ; thus it has been difficult to isolate generic principles amidst the volume of empirical data@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spatial and temporal resolution of _ in - situ _ experimental probes is limited ; this makes it difficult to follow microstructural changes at short length and time scales .",
    "we believe progress can only be made if we ( a ) identify simple ` model ' systems which would serve as an arena for detailed studies on the dynamics of structural transitions in solids and ( b ) develop ` probes ' to study the dynamics and morphology changes at short scales ; in other words to _ follow the motion of individual atoms as the transformation proceeds_. high speed computational modelling allows one to make useful contributions to both ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this paper concerns point ( a )  we provide a model system for a simple structural transition which could serve as a test bed for future studies of statics and dynamics of structural transitions . in another paper@xcite",
    "we have discussed point ( b )  we have studied the dynamics of solid state transformations in this model system by tracking individual particles as the transformation proceeds .",
    "our choice of the simple structural transformation , a square to a rhombic lattice in two dimensions ( 2-d ) , is motivated by two important considerations .",
    "the first is its relevance to ` real ' solid state transformations .",
    "the square - to - rhombus transition may be regarded as a rather accurate representation@xcite of the three dimensional tetragonal to orthorhombic ( to ) transition@xcite in an oriented single crystal where the strain along the third direction ( c - axis ) is negligible .",
    "this transition is observed in many technologically important systems@xcite , such as the high - t@xmath0 compound yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the second motivation is more conceptual and warrants some explanation . following a quench across a structural transition ,",
    "the atoms constituting the solid have to rearrange themselves , since the parent phase is thermodynamically unstable . instead of moving to the new equilibrium configuration , the motion of the atoms is arrested in a final microstructure which is very far from equilibrium",
    ". the microstructures often display features at length scales ranging from @xmath4 , many orders larger than the lattice spacing .",
    "a more appropriate description of the dynamics at these scales is in terms of continuum degrees of freedom .",
    "it is however not clear _ apriori _ , what are the relevant continuum degrees of freedom , especially in situations where the solid undergoes large deformations from the parent . in most theoretical studies of this problem ,",
    "the only continuum degrees of freedom relevant at these scales have been taken to be the components of the strain tensor@xcite .",
    "however , short length scale phenomena like atomic rearrangements@xcite are not captured by these strain - only theories and may in some cases affect the kinetics of the transformation . the only unbiased way to determine",
    "the complete set of relevant degrees of freedom in the continuum is to start from a more microscopic description and arrive at a continuum description using a coarse - graining method@xcite .",
    "such a coarse - graining program is more easily set up in the crystallographically simpler square - to - rhombus transition .",
    "how microscopically detailed should our microscopic model solid be ?",
    "an ab - initio or semi empirical description@xcite which includes electronic degrees of freedom tailor - made for a real system such as yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 suffers from 3 drawbacks  ( i ) it compromises the need for generality , ( ii ) it is computationally expensive and ( iii ) it is difficult to extrapolate to the continuum .",
    "we therefore model an _ effective _ hamiltonian accurate over distances smaller than the bulk elastic correlation length but larger than the typical atomic spacing .",
    "this effective hamiltonian , coarse - grained over the faster electronic degrees of freedom , will in general have pair and many - body interactions .",
    "our model system therefore consists of a set of n ` particles ' confined in a 2-d box of volume v at a fixed temperature t. the particles interact with each other via specific two and three -body@xcite interactions .",
    "while the 2-body interaction stabilizes a rhombic lattice ( triangular for _ isotropic _ two - body potentials ) , the 3-body interactions have been _ constructed _ to favour a square lattice .",
    "unlike in a real solid , the square to triangular transition in our model solid may be driven by _ independently _ ( i ) increasing the density , ( ii ) decreasing the temperature or ( iii ) decreasing the relative magnitude of the three - body potential .",
    "we confine ourselves here to the equilibrium aspects of this transition and postpone a detailed study of the nucleation and coarsening dynamics to a subsequent publication@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we introduce our model , describing the pair and three -body potentials . in section",
    "iii we present the static lattice ( zero temperature ) results for the energy , stress and the elastic constants and exhibit the zero temperature phase diagram . in section",
    "iv we discuss the effect of finite temperatures .",
    "we present results both from a `` cell model '' approximation@xcite and from molecular dynamics simulations@xcite in the nvt ensemble . in section",
    "v we discuss a simple generalization of the model to include a molecular solid with a complex basis motif .",
    "section vi presents a summary and conclusion of this work .",
    "in this section we motivate the form of the _ effective _ hamiltonian , coarse - grained over the faster electronic degrees of freedom . instead of starting out _ ab - initio _ , we shall assume that the solid can be described by a general functional of the densities of particles . a simple form of the density functional , proposed by ramakrishnan and yussouff ( ry)@xcite , views the solid as an extremely inhomogeneous liquid with a non - uniform , periodic , coarse - grained density @xmath5 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it allows us to make accurate statements at any finite temperature @xmath6 .",
    "following ry , we may write the helmholtz free energy @xmath7 per unit volume @xmath8 of the solid as , @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\sum_{\\bf g}\\rho_{\\bf g}\\rho_{\\bf -g}c^{(2)}({\\bf g } ) - \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\sum_{\\bf g_1,g_2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\rho_{{\\bf g}_1}\\rho_{{\\bf g}_2}\\rho_{-{\\bf g}_1-{\\bf g}_2}\\,c^{(3)}({{\\bf g}_1,{\\bf g}_2,-{\\bf g}_1-{\\bf g}_2 } ) + \\cdots   \\label{dft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the leading term gives the ideal gas contribution ( the integral is over the wigner - seitz unit cell of volume @xmath10 ) , while the subsequent terms arise from the interactions between density waves @xmath11 with wave - vector @xmath12 belonging to the set @xmath13 of reciprocal lattice vectors ( rlv ) of the crystalline solid .",
    "note that we have defined the fourier transform as , @xmath14    the interaction terms involve the fourier transform of the @xmath15-order direct correlation functions @xmath16 .",
    "these functions may either be evaluated from a liquid state theory@xcite or deduced from scattering experiments ( for instance , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the structure factor of the liquid at wavenumber @xmath19 ) ; however evaluation ( or measurement ) of direct correlation functions beyond the second order is extremely difficult@xcite .",
    "approximate ways of incorporating the effects of these higher order correlations have been used with varying degrees of success@xcite , though often a simple weak coupling ( mean - field ) approximation , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 body potential , works remarkably well@xcite .",
    "while the ideal gas term always prefers a uniform liquid , the sign of the interaction term decides whether the interactions stabilize ( destabilize ) density waves with wave - vectors @xmath23 . as an example , let us consider first the effect of only the second order terms in eq.[dft ] .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath24 , measure the stability of a density wave with wavenumber @xmath25 . in fig.[cofq ] we have plotted @xmath26 against @xmath19 for a slightly supercooled hard disk liquid@xcite in two - dimensions .",
    "this function is oscillatory and has a primary peak at roughly the wave number corresponding to the magnitude of the smallest rlv of the thermodynamically stable solid .",
    "choosing the lattice parameter such that the smallest rlv coincides with the first peak of @xmath26 , we have plotted the positions of the rlvs for the triangular ( top ) and square ( bottom ) lattices in fig.[cofq ] .",
    "closed packed lattices have rlvs which are , on an average , more widely separated than those of an open lattice . as a consequence , open lattices often have rlvs lying in the region of the first _",
    "minimum _ of @xmath26 which is negative , thereby contributing to a destabilisation of the lattice . from fig.[cofq ] we observe that this is indeed the case for the square lattice in two - dimensions@xcite .",
    "density waves corresponding to the second rlv of the square lattice with miller index @xmath27 are not favoured , making the square lattice unstable in two - dimensions .",
    "note that the discussion above is the finite @xmath28 generalisation of the zero temperature result that for isotropic , purely repulsive _ pair _ potentials in two dimensions , one can only stabilize the close - packed triangular lattice@xcite .",
    "for instance , a static calculation@xcite of the @xmath29 elastic moduli of the square lattice reveals a shear instability which spontaneously distorts the lattice till it regains a close - packed structure .    in order to stabilize the square lattice one needs to go beyond the second order contribution and consider the effect of three - body correlations . as is clear from eq.[dft ] , a positive ( and large enough ! ) contribution from @xmath30 , where any one ( or two ) of the wave - vectors equals @xmath31 , can compensate for the destabilizing effect of the second order correlator@xcite .",
    "there are many choices for the wave - vectors @xmath12 , but the simplest combination is @xmath32 ( so that @xmath33 ) . a straightforward way to ensure that this combination of density waves is stabilized is to stabilize the _",
    "real space _ triangle involving the direct lattice vectors @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( and those related to them by symmetry ) . within a simple minded mean - field approximation this may be accomplished , as shown below , by choosing an appropriate three - body potential which favours @xmath37 and @xmath38 bonds .",
    "higher- order interactions involving four or more particles , though present in principle , are not necessary for our purpose .",
    "our model system , constructed from this level of coarse - graining , therefore consists of ` point - particles ' interacting with effective pair and three -body potentials .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath39 of the system is given by , @xmath40 for the pair potential we take , @xmath41    which is purely repulsive and therefore the system has to be confined with a uniform hydrostatic pressure ( see below ) .",
    "a purely repulsive system simplifies our analysis since there is one fewer length scale and one fewer non  -solid phase . without the 3-body potential ,",
    "our system is characterized by only one parameter instead of the two ( temperature and density ) .",
    "on including the 3-body potential , we lose this simplification , but the variation of thermodynamic properties with density is still weak . without loss of generality we can take @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be our units for energy and distance respectively .",
    "the 3-body potential is @xmath44   \\label{threebody}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the function , @xmath45    and we have used the notation @xmath46 .",
    "the angles are as defined in fig.2 .",
    "the function @xmath47 provides a cutoff for the 3-body potential ; as long as @xmath47 is short ranged , the actual form of this function does not affect the qualitative results .",
    "it may appear that a three - body potential requires a large investment in terms of computer times .",
    "this apprehension is fortunately unfounded .",
    "the form of this potential ensures that three - body energies can be calculated@xcite extremely efficiently , requiring a computational effort not exceeding that for the pair part .",
    "this is discussed in the appendix .",
    "at zero temperature , the equilibrium configuration is a solid which minimises the potential @xmath39 .",
    "since we work in the constant nvt ( and shape ) ensemble , the density @xmath48 is a constant . assuming that the only minima of @xmath39 correspond to the triangular or square phases , we have numerically deduced the @xmath29 phase diagram in the @xmath49 plane ( fig.[t0phase ] ) . later in this section",
    "we show , within a restricted variational calculation , that these are the only minimisers of @xmath39 . as we see from fig .",
    "[ t0phase ] , the triangular lattice is the lowest energy phase at high densities and small values of @xmath50 , _",
    "i.e. , _ wherever the pair interaction dominates over the three - body part . across the boundary",
    "there is a strong first - order transition with a discontinuous change in the slope @xmath51 .    to deduce the nature of the order parameter distinguishing the square from the triangular phase , we look at how a rhombic lattice may be obtained from a square",
    "such an analysis makes contact with continuum elasticity in a natural way .    at zero temperature",
    ", a continuous family of perfect rhombic lattices ( labelled by position vectors @xmath52 ) can be obtained from the perfect square lattice ( labelled by @xmath53 ) by the transformation , @xmath54 where the transformation matrix t is , @xmath55    the parameters @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) are related to the components of a strain tensor by the following construction .",
    "we choose to measure all distortions and energies with respect to the undistorted _ square _ phase  our reference state .",
    "the microscopic displacements @xmath58 are therefore defined at every @xmath59 on the reference lattice , _",
    "i.e. , _ we use _",
    "lagrangian_@xcite coordinates .",
    "the full nonlinear lagrangian strain tensor@xcite @xmath60 is , @xmath61 where the indices @xmath62 go over @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 in eq.[matrix ] represent the combinations @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , which reduce to the usual volumetric , deviatoric and shear strains once nonlinearities are neglected .",
    "note that one may start with a prescribed square and end with a final triangular lattice in more than one way  the transformation parameters are not unique .",
    "for instance , for a given orientation of the parent square lattice shown in fig.[trian](i ) one obtains a rhombic lattice using @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "equivalently ( fig.[trian](ii ) ) the square lattice ( first rotated by @xmath70 ) can be transformed to a centered rectangular lattice with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the two transformations are completely equivalent .",
    "one of the ofshoots of this nonuniqueness , is that any rhombus obtained as a uniform deformation of a perfect square , can be represented by two independent parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in addition , since the density @xmath75 is a constant in our nvt ensemble , @xmath76 is related to @xmath77 ; @xmath78 . thus",
    "all rhombic lattices considered by us can be labelled by a single parameter @xmath79 ( which by definition is @xmath80 for the perfect square lattice ) .",
    "this makes the shear strain @xmath81 a good order parameter which distinguishes the square from the triangular lattices .",
    "we may now calculate the energy of @xmath29 configurations as a function of the order parameter @xmath81 .",
    "a calculation of the energy @xmath39 and its derivatives ( elastic moduli ) for a given lattice involves computation of lattice sums .",
    "we start with a finite square lattice containing @xmath82 sites and allow the transformation @xmath83 to produce a continuous sequence of rhombic lattices labelled by @xmath81 .",
    "we have checked for convergence of the lattice sums by increasing the size of the lattice and observing the consequent change in the numerical values . in fig.[energy ] we have plotted the energy per particle @xmath84 as a function of the parameter @xmath81 for various values of @xmath50 ( keeping @xmath75 fixed ) .",
    "note that for large values of @xmath50 there is only one minimum at @xmath85 so that the square lattice is the only stable phase . for smaller values of @xmath50 two",
    "additional degenerate minima appear at @xmath86 which correspond to the triangular lattice .",
    "the transition is first - order with the order parameter jumping discontinuously , @xmath87 .",
    "note that in this model the change in the shear strain across the transition is fixed ; we shall return to this point in sect .",
    "v where we propose a variant of this model in which the jump in the shear strain across the structural transition can be made arbitrarily small . as expected ,",
    "the square and triangular lattices are the only minimisers of @xmath39 within this parametrisation scheme .    to make contact with elasticity theory we may compute stresses and elastic moduli , obtained by evaluating appropriate derivatives of the energy keeping @xmath88 constant  @xmath89 ( fig.[stress ] ) , and @xmath90 ( fig.[moduli ] ) .",
    "note that our system is always under a hydrostatic pressure @xmath91 ; the constant density constraint implies that for @xmath92 there is an applied shear stress @xmath93 ( fig.[stress ] ) .",
    "this implies that the slope of the shear stress _",
    "vs_@xmath77 curve is not the shear modulus @xmath94 ( defined for zero external stress ) but @xmath95 ( fig . [ moduli ] ) .    at this stage , we find it useful to point out that the results of figs .",
    "[ energy]-[moduli ] can be rationalized using a systematic power series expansion of the energy in terms of @xmath56 .",
    "although such expansions are quite common in the literature@xcite , our results show that fourth order terms in @xmath56 , especially cross couplings of the form @xmath96 and @xmath97 , together with coupling to the external hydrostatic pressure @xmath98 need to be included in order to reproduce the @xmath29 results accurately .",
    "the coefficients of all these terms are however not independent . for instance , relationships like , @xmath99 dictated by the geometry of the triangular phase have to be satisfied for all temperatures and densities .",
    "in this section we have been able to show that our model potential indeed produces the square and the triangular lattices as minima of the energy .",
    "the potential parameters maybe tuned , if necessary , to a real system by comparing the elastic properties of this model system to experimentally measured quantities . by varying the density or",
    "the strength of the three - body potential one obtains a zero temperature first order structural transition between a square and triangular lattice .",
    "what happens to the structural transition at non - zero temperatures ?",
    "we study this question in the next section .",
    "in this section we analyse the phase diagram at @xmath100 as a function of @xmath50 or @xmath75 . we do this by two methods  an ` exact ' molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation@xcite in the constant nvt ensemble , using the 2- and 3-body potentials defined earlier , and an approximate ` cell - model'@xcite based on the deformation parameter @xmath81 .",
    "the latter leads naturally to an approximate continuum elasticity description at @xmath100 .",
    "we take up the cell - model analysis first and compare its results with the exact md simulation in the next subsection .",
    "imagine being in a region of the zero temperature parameter space @xmath101 , where the square solid is the stable minimum of the energy . as the temperature",
    "is gradually increased , the contribution of the phonon entropy to the ( helmholtz ) free energy destabilizes the square lattice . in order to quantify this effect",
    "one needs to go beyond the static lattice and consider phonon fluctuations .",
    "although a direct calculation of the contribution of phonons to the lattice energy is straightforward@xcite , we choose to use the much simpler , though not necessarily less accurate ` cell - model ' approximation .    before discussing the cell - model approximation ,",
    "let us mark its regime of validity .",
    "first , the cell - model approximation neglects contributions from topological defects like dislocation - antidislocation pairs and thus breaks down near the melting point@xcite . in two dimensions",
    ", there is a further complication , since fluctuations of the displacement field @xmath102 due to phonons diverge logarithmically@xcite with system size .",
    "this divergence is however weak and may be ignored for the system sizes under consideration .    recall that at @xmath29 , the configurations of the perfect rhombi were parametrised by a single deformation variable @xmath81 .",
    "is this true at @xmath100 , when the lattices are not perfect due to phonon fluctuations ?",
    "it turns out that the constraints of rhombic symmetry and constant density still allow a parametrization of the @xmath100 configurations by a single _ function _",
    "@xmath103 , at least when the temperatures are low .",
    "thus the energy @xmath39 may be written as a functional of @xmath81 , which at low temperatures may be replaced by its mean @xmath104 .",
    "within the cell - model approximation , the partition function of a lattice of @xmath105 particles at temperature @xmath28 is given by@xcite , @xmath106^n \\,\\",
    ", \\times \\nonumber \\\\    &   & \\,\\,\\,\\exp(-e(\\langle \\epsilon\\rangle)/k_bt)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath107 is the thermal wavelength and @xmath108 is the change in potential energy of a single particle as it moves around within a unit cell of size @xmath109 in a potential well arising from its interaction with all its neighbours .",
    "a further harmonic approximation for @xmath108 leads to the familiar einstein approximation . at the other extreme , for the hard disk potential , @xmath110 except where overlaps occur and the cell - model approximation becomes identical to the",
    "free volume_@xcite theory .",
    "the helmholtz free energy for any rhombic lattice labelled by @xmath111 may now be obtained by using @xmath112 .",
    "evaluation of the helmholtz free energy ( fig .",
    "[ cell ] ) allows us to calculate the @xmath113 phase diagram at any density @xmath75 as also the limits of metastability of the square lattice .      to obtain accurate results for the phase stability at non - zero temperatures ,",
    "we have used a molecular dynamics simulation for our model system .",
    "we simulate @xmath114 particles ( @xmath115 unit cells with vacancy to improve the kinetics ) in the nvt ensemble using a standard nos - hoover thermostat . starting from an ideal square lattice ,",
    "we have equilibriated systems at various values of @xmath50 and temperature for a fixed density for about @xmath116 molecular dynamics time steps or till thermodynamic quantities like the pressure and energy have stabilized .",
    "the final structure is then examined and this information used to obtain the phase diagrams shown in fig.[md ] .",
    "we display the phase diagram for two densities @xmath117 and @xmath118 . together with the molecular dynamics results we have also plotted the results of the cell - model approximation .",
    "we observe that for low temperatures , the cell - model approximation faithfully reproduces the actual phase boundary while at higher temperatures it begins to deviate .",
    "the cell - model approximation is also used to plot the limit of stability of the square phase in the triangular region .",
    "both the molecular dynamics simulations and the cell model calculations predict that the square to triangular transition remains first - order over a wide region of parameter space even at non - zero temperatures . for larger density , the transition point shifts to higher values of @xmath50 .",
    "this is expected since a high density favours the triangular lattice .",
    "also , the square phase becomes unstable for lower values of @xmath50 as the density is increased .",
    "the jump in the order parameter remains fixed at @xmath119 all along the transition line .",
    "this aspect of our model is specifically addressed in the next section , where we show that inclusion of an anisotropic _ pair _ interaction allows one to tune the order parameter jump all the way to zero .",
    "we end this section with the following observations .",
    "we have seen that the exact md and approximate cell model give qualitatively similar results .",
    "more sophisticated phonon fluctuation calculations may even produce quantitative aggreement .",
    "figure [ cell ] suggests that the helmholtz free energy may be expanded in powers of @xmath81 , just as was noted at @xmath29 . though we do not explicitly demonstrate here , we may recover elasticity theory ( including corrections arising from thermal fluctuations ) by constructively coarse - graining as in ref .",
    "the model 2-d solid discussed in the preceding sections has the virtue that it is simple enough to begin a detailed theoretical study of both the equilibrium and dynamical features of the to transition across a range of length and time scales .",
    "however if we were to compare the results of such a study with experiments on realistic systems , we would immediately face a problem .",
    "most solids undergoing a to transition@xcite , for instance yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , have a complex basis , consisting of many atoms per unit cell .",
    "these systems generically have much smaller jumps in the shear strain at the to transition compared to the jump computed in the previous section . to appreciate the _ quantitative _ discrepancy , recall the discussion following eq .",
    "[ defstrain ] , where we showed that any perfect rhombus obtained as a deformation of a square may be parametrized by either @xmath81 or @xmath120 . defining an _ orthorhombic distortion _ as @xmath121",
    ", we find that @xmath122 for our model square - to - triangle structural transition  significantly larger than @xmath123 for the to transition in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "apart from this , there might be a more serious _",
    "qualitative _ mismatch between our model solid and real systems undergoing a to transition .",
    "changes in temperature or pressure ( hydrostatic or chemical ) may lead to a local structural rearrangement ( optical modes ) which would couple to the strain tensor .",
    "the jump in the shear strain across the structural transition may therefore , unlike in our model solid , vary along the phase boundary , even going to zero ( phonon softening ) at a critical point@xcite",
    ".    we shall see that we may address both these issues within an anisotropic variant of our model solid .",
    "our attempt will be to incorporate the complex basis , with many atoms per unit cell , into an _ effective _ hamiltonian between ` point particles ' . in the spirit of an effective hamiltonian , we will coarse - grain the density over a length and time scale corresponding to the ` size ' @xmath124 and relaxation time @xmath125 of the basis .",
    "thus we may define a coarse - grained density as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 labels the atomic species making up the basis . this coarse - grained density profile",
    "@xmath5 will have peaks at the centre of mass of each basis , falling off to zero over a length scale @xmath124 and having a cross section which is spatially anisotropic .",
    "if we assume that this anisotropic cross section has a fixed shape at a given temperature and pressure ( true when the associated optical branch is much higher than the acoustic branches ) , then we may write the effective hamiltonian as arising from a collection of ` point particles ' interacting via an anisotropic potential .",
    "the form of the effective hamiltonian may also be motivated in terms of a density wave picture @xcite in much the same way as in section ii .",
    "an anisotropic density interacts via an anisotropic direct correlation function . within a mean field approach this reduces to a pair potential which depends not only on the distance between the two basis motifs but also on their orientation relative to the crystal axes ",
    "orientation fluctuations within the motifs being neglected .    for specificity",
    "if we assume 2 atoms per basis , we may then arrive at the following modification of the two - body potential using the arguments outlined above , @xmath128    where the anisotropy parameter @xmath129 has a fixed value at constant @xmath28 and @xmath98 . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3-body potential may be taken to be the same as in eq.[threebody ] . setting @xmath130",
    ", we see that @xmath131 is always positive .",
    "all angles are measured with respect to the @xmath132 $ ] axes of the undistorted square lattice .",
    "the angle @xmath133 represents the orientation of the basis and @xmath134 , see fig.[molsol ] .",
    "the total energy is a function of @xmath133 so that uniform rotations of the basis with respect to the crystal axes cost energy ( optical mode ) while simultaneous rotations of the basis together with the crystal axes is a symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "using the modified two - body potential ( eq.[eq : modpsi2 ] ) , we compute the energy as a function of @xmath81 as in section iii . for a fixed @xmath129 ,",
    "the total energy minimized with respect to @xmath133 and @xmath81 leads to @xmath135 ( independent of @xmath81 ) .",
    "as before there are 3 minima in @xmath81 , one at @xmath136 ( corresponding to a square ) and the other two corresponding to rhombi with @xmath137 being _ smaller _ than the value for the perfect triangular lattice @xmath138 ( fig.[molsol ] ) .",
    "the jump in the value of the shear strain @xmath81 across the structural transition is therefore smaller than that obtained in section iii .",
    "moreover we find that this jump in @xmath81 goes to zero and the region over which the square phase is metastable shrinks and disappears as @xmath139 thus indicating a _ continuous transition _ at a tricritical point .",
    "one expects , therefore , that for real systems fluctuation effects near the t - o transition would be more pronounced . this fact is actually bourne out by experiments@xcite .",
    "the zero and finite temperature phase diagrams are shown in fig.[phasediag ] .",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram clearly shows the location of the tricritical point where the jump in the order parameter vanishes .",
    "the effect of finite temperatures is addressed easily within a cell - model approximation .",
    "the calculation may be carried out along the lines outlined in the last section .",
    "once again we see that the helmholtz free energy can be written as a power series expansion in @xmath81 .",
    "the results of the calculation are expected to be accurate at low temperatures if the anisotropy is not too large . for larger anisotropies",
    "the effect of ( tri)-critical fluctuations may alter the results of our simple mean - field estimates .",
    "our result shows that the square lattice now becomes stable over a much larger range of @xmath50 than in the isotropic case .",
    "the region of metastability of the square lattice however decreases and the first - order transition is weakened .",
    "in this paper we have described a model system which is designed to undergo a square to rhombus transition in two dimensions . we believe that our study will be useful in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", it may be used as a simple simulational model for the t - o transition in real materials which often consists of a large number of individual atomic species making it difficult to study using ab - initio methods . for this purpose ,",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath129 have to be `` fitted '' to observed properties of the particular realistic system . on the other hand",
    ", we could use this system to study , in general , the dynamical pathways of a simple first order solid state phase transition involving a structural transition .",
    "it is this context that we would like to emphasize .",
    "once the equilibrium properties are determined , we look at the nucleation dynamics , growth modes and microstructure of the rhombic phase growing in the matrix of the parent square lattice@xcite . the effect of defects such as vacancies and dislocations are automatically incorporated in our microscopic approach . in future , we hope to obtain atomistically detailed information about the statics and dynamics of solid - solid interfaces .",

    "in general , evaluation of three body energies requires sums over all possible triplets which for a system of reasonable size is prohibitively expensive .",
    "the particular form for the three body potential used by us is , however , special and can be evaluated without keeping track of triplets .",
    "we illustrate below how this may be done for our system@xcite and derive an explicit expression for the energy .      now define @xmath141 and @xmath142 so that @xmath143 and @xmath144 . using the above definitions and the quantities , @xmath145 we get , @xmath146 with , @xmath147\\,-\\,16\\times\\nonumber \\\\      &    & \\lbrace g_i(3)f_i + 32\\,g_i(3)^2 + 2\\,g_i(4)^2 + g_i(1)^2\\,-\\ , \\nonumber \\\\       &    & 16 \\,g_i(3 ) g_i(1 ) - 4\\,g_i(5)g_i(2 ) + 16\\,g_i(5)^2 \\rbrace\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
