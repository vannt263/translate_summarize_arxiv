    "<S> in this paper we investigate the asymptotics of forward - start options and the forward implied volatility smile in the heston model as the maturity approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the forward smile for out - of - the - money options explodes and compute a closed - form high - order expansion detailing the rate of the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the result shows that the square - root behaviour of the variance process induces a singularity such that for certain parameter configurations one can not obtain high - order out - of - the - money forward smile asymptotics . in the at - the - money case </S>",
    "<S> a separate model - independent analysis shows that the small - maturity limit is well defined for any it diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs rely on the theory of sharp large deviations ( and refinements ) and incidentally we provide an example of degenerate large deviations behaviour . </S>"
