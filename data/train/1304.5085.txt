    "on july 2012 , both atlas and cms groups reported that they found a new particle whose mass is around 125  gev  @xcite .",
    "this particle is expected to be the higgs boson predicted in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "although the data are consistent with this expectation , the signal strength of the diphoton decay mode has received attention .",
    "atlas experiment has detected larger signal strength than the sm expectation . although the current deviations from the sm are still less than 2 sigma , it is intriguing to explore possible implications for new physics which can explain this excess . since this process",
    "is induced via one - loop diagram , it is an ideal place where new physics can readily set in .",
    "hence , the diphoton channel can provide an effective probe of possible heavy new states which hide in the loop and have not yet manifested in the direct productions .    in the sm ,",
    "the @xmath5 boson loop diagrams give the dominant contributions to this process .",
    "therefore , if we have one more @xmath5 boson , namely relatively light @xmath6 , then the diphoton signal might be enhanced .",
    "this idea is easily modelized by extending the electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "the minimal extension is su(2)@xmath7su(2)@xmath7u(1 ) .",
    "this gauge structure contains @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as the sm gauge bosons .",
    "it is also required to extend the higgs sector for correct symmetry breaking pattern . in a simple realization of it , two cp - even scalars are predicted .",
    "one of these scalars is identified as the observed particle at the lhc .    in this talk , we focus on the signal strength of the lighter cp - even scalar . other interesting phenomena in this model ( such as the perturbative unitarity structure , phenomenology of heavier cp - even scalar ) are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the gauge symmetry in this model is su(3)@xmath8su(2)@xmath9su(2)@xmath10u(1)@xmath11 , where su(3)@xmath12 is qcd part and others are electroweak sector .",
    "we introduce two higgs fields , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for the electroweak symmetry breaking . the symmetry breaking patterns are su(2)@xmath9su(2)@xmath15su(2)@xmath16 by @xmath13 , and su(2)@xmath10u(1)@xmath17u(1)@xmath16 by @xmath14 , where the suffix @xmath18 stand for the diagonal part .",
    "after both symmetry breaking , the remnant symmetry is u(1)@xmath19 , and the six of the gauge fields become massive .",
    "these massive gauge bosons are @xmath20 , and @xmath3 .",
    "each higgs fields contain four real scalars , and six of them are eaten by the gauge bosons .",
    "remaining two scalars , we call them as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are physical degrees of freedom .",
    "these two scalars are , however , not mass eigenstates which we define @xmath23 we assume @xmath0 is 125  gev and @xmath1 is heavier than @xmath0 . as we will see in later , the phenomenology of @xmath0 is highly depending on this mixing angle , @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce vector - like fermions as well as chiral fermions .",
    "the charge assignments are summarized in table  [ tab : fermion ] .",
    ".assignments for fermions under the gauge group of the present model . in the fourth and fifth columns ,",
    "the u(1)@xmath11 charges and su(3)@xmath12 representations are shown for the quarks ( without parentheses ) and leptons ( in parentheses ) , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     after the symmetry breaking , the vector - like and chiral fermions are mixed .",
    "then the mass eigenstates given by the mixture of the chiral and vector - like fermions . due to this mixing",
    ", we can suppress potentially dangerous contributions to @xmath25 parameter at tree level without making @xmath6 much heavy .",
    "in addition , the extra degrees of freedom in the fermion sector help to enhance @xmath26 .",
    "we will see this cross section enhancement is crucial to explain the diphoton excess in this model .    at tree level ,",
    "the @xmath25 parameter is approximately given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 couplings to the sm fermions respectively .",
    "the later coupling is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the mixing angle in the fermion sector   is determined by heavy fermion masses and yukawa couplings . but its detail form is not important here . ] .",
    "we can realize @xmath33 by choosing a proper configuration @xmath32 for the light fermion mass - eigenstates .",
    "then @xmath25 parameter is suppressed even if @xmath34 is lighter than 1  tev  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath35  tev , then we can not expect @xmath6 affects to the diphoton excess because such a heavy @xmath6 is decoupled from the sm sector .",
    "so , suppressed @xmath29 is suitable in our purpose , and hereafter we take @xmath36 to mimic the ideal fermion delocalization @xcite .",
    "then we get another advantage : we can avoid direct detection bounds  @xcite , because these bounds are derived under the assumptions that @xmath6 is produced via drell - yan process , which never happen if @xmath36 .",
    "since we impose @xmath37 , the mixing angle in the fermion sector is determined by the parameters in the gauge sector .",
    "it is natural to assume @xmath38 , then the mixing angle is small as long as @xmath39   and @xmath40 region , @xmath34 becomes heavier than a few tev , and @xmath29 is not needed to be suppressed to satisfy both electroweak precision constraints and direct detection bounds .",
    "however , such heavy @xmath6 is almost decoupled from the sm sector and does not help to explain the diphoton excess .",
    "so we focus only in @xmath41 region in this talk . ] , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wff ] ) .",
    "hence , the main components of the sm fermions are the chiral fermions . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - sm fermions are approximately the vector - like fermions .    in this setup , we find the @xmath0 couplings to the sm gauge bosons are suppressed as a consequence of the perturbative unitarity restoration mechanism in the longitudinally polarized gauge boson scattering processes . in the sm case , the amplitude of @xmath42 process is proportional to @xmath43 if the higgs boson contribution were absent . the higgs boson exactly cancel this @xmath43 terms , and perturbative unitarity is restored , not violated at higher scale .",
    "this exact cancellation of @xmath43 terms is guaranteed by the relations among some couplings , so called unitarity sum rules ; @xmath44 which is a consequence of gauge symmetry and renormalizablity . in our model case ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath1 contribute to the process as well .",
    "we find the following sum rule for the @xmath43 term cancellation in @xmath46 scattering amplitude : @xmath47 as a consequence , the @xmath0 coupling to the @xmath5 bosons should be smaller than the sm case due to the extra contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath1 ; otherwise an over cancellation occurs and @xmath43 terms does not vanish . in a similar manner , we can find the suppression of the @xmath0 coupling to the @xmath48 bosons . due to these coupling suppression , br(@xmath49 ) is smaller than the sm case and related signal strengths are suppressed , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "in this section , we calculate the @xmath0 production cross section via gluon fusion process , and some signal strengths for @xmath0 .",
    "we start off by studying the @xmath0 production cross section via gluon fusion process .",
    "the cross section of this process can be enhanced because this is a loop induced process by colored particles and our model contains extra fermions as well as the sm fermions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gg2h ] , we show the ratio of @xmath26 in this model to the sm one .",
    "it highly depends on the parameters in the higgs sector , especially @xmath24 .",
    "we find the cross section is enhanced in some region .",
    "this enhancement is due to the contributions from the extra fermions .",
    "this cross section also depends on @xmath34 although the process seems independent from the gauge sector .",
    "this is due to the condition we take , @xmath37 : this condition makes a connection among parameters in the fermion sector and the gauge sector , as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wff ] ) . hence fig .",
    "[ fig : gg2h ] shows the @xmath34 dependence .",
    "we take @xmath50  gev ( in the panel ( a ) ) and @xmath51  gev ( in the panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the variable in the horizontal axis is the mixing angle in the higgs sector , and @xmath52 is the vev ratio of the two higgs fields , @xmath53 .",

    "we focus on three signal strengths , @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gg2h2vv_v1 ] , we show these signal strengths as a function of @xmath24 , with @xmath61 .",
    "we find diphoton signal excess around @xmath62 .",
    "therefore this model can explain the excess observed by both atlas and cms .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath63 is suppressed .",
    "they are smaller than a half of the sm prediction . since the central values of these process are near the sm prediction , this result looks unattractive .",
    "these suppression in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 channels are originated from the suppression of the @xmath0 couplings to the sm gauge bosons , discussed around eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) .",
    "since the couplings depend on @xmath52 , the situation can be moderated by the choice of @xmath52 , and we find it is true . in fig .",

    "the only difference of these processes from the sm case is the @xmath0 couplings to the sm gauge bosons , namely @xmath75 the inequality in this equation is due to the suppression of the @xmath0 couplings to the sm gauge bosons as we discussed around eq .",
