    "the torque @xmath1 acting on a wire induced by a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 is given by the well known formula @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetic dipole moment of the wire .",
    "in all elementary textbooks on electromagnetism ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) this formula is introduced by studying the example of a rectangular wire , for which the magnetic dipole moment can be explicitly written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the area of the wire , @xmath7 is the current passing through it and @xmath8 is the normal to the plane of the wire , with orientation consistent with that of the current .    also in more advanced textbooks the complete derivation of is usually skipped and just the example of the rectangular wires is presented .",
    "two notable exceptions to this rule are the 8th volume of the landau theoretical physics course ( ref .",

    "128 ) and the book by j.  d.  jackson ( ref .",

    "188 - 190 ) : the ( sketch of the ) proof by landau relies on a variation on the theme of the stokes theorem @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a generic vector field and the integrals in the left and right hand side of the equation are line and surface integrals respectively .",
    "jackson s proof uses instead the identity @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are scalar functions of the position and @xmath14 is a vector field of compact support .",
    "we will present a completely elementary proof of together with the ones by landau and jackson , reviewed here with some more details than in the original references .",
    "we will then show how the computation can be extended to the more general cases of non closed wires and non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "the starting point is the lorentz force acting on an element @xmath15 of the wire , which in si units is @xmath16 where @xmath7 is the current .",
    "the torque acting on the wire is then @xmath17 let us now suppose the wire to be parametrized by the function @xmath18 , with @xmath19 $ ] a real parameter .",
    "in this case @xmath20 ( we denote by the dot the derivation with respect to @xmath21 ) and can be rewritten in the form @xmath22    by using the vectorial identity @xmath23 we can rewrite in the form @xmath24 and it is simple to show that the second term vanishes in an uniform field : the vector @xmath2 can be carried out of the integral , which finally reduces to @xmath25 since @xmath26 for a closed wire .    by expressing the first term of in components we have ( summation on the repeated indices is always assumed when not otherwise stated ) @xmath27_i\\ , { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t = b_j\\int_0 ^ 1 \\dot{s}_i s_j \\ , { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t= \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}b_j\\int_0 ^ 1(\\dot{s}_i s_j+\\dot{s}_j s_i){\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t+\\frac{1}{2}b_j\\int_0 ^ 1(\\dot{s}_i s_j - \\dot{s}_j s_i){\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t=\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}b_j\\int_0 ^ 1\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t}(s_is_j){\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t+\\frac{1}{2}b_j\\int_0 ^ 1(\\dot{s}_i s_j - \\dot{s}_j s_i){\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t=\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0 ^ 1 \\big [ \\dot{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{s}}}}({\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b}}}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{s}}})-{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{s}}}({\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b}}}\\cdot\\dot{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{s}}}})\\big]_i { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t   } \\ ] ] where the total derivative term vanishes for the same reason as the integral in does . on the other hand from the identity in we",
    "have @xmath28 so that from , and we get @xmath29 which is the desired with the identification of the dipole magnetic moment @xmath30 going back to the line integral form we finally obtain @xmath31 which for planar wires reduces to the simple expression @xmath5 , since the element of area is given by @xmath32 .",
    "in this section we will present a proof of by using the identity , whose proof is given in .",
    "we first of all show how the form of the magnetic dipole moment can be simplified by using the extension of the stokes theorem proven in the appendix : by using we immediately get ( since @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) @xmath36 and thus becomes @xmath37 which is the simplest extension to non planar wires of the expression @xmath38 valid in the planar case . clearly",
    "the result of does not depend on the choice of the surface of integration : if we denote by @xmath39 a constant vector , the difference between the ( projection on @xmath39 of the ) results obtained with two different choices @xmath40 and @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the volume bounded by the surfaces @xmath40 and @xmath41 . since this is true for every @xmath39",
    "we conclude that @xmath44 .    in order to apply to the computation of the torque it is convenient to use the following vectorial identity @xmath45 and rewrite in the form @xmath46 by comparison with the second term",
    "can be recast in the form @xmath47 , while applying to the first term we get @xmath48 by using the relations ( which can be easily checked by direct computation ) @xmath49 and we thus get @xmath50 using this result in we finally obtain .",
    "this proof makes use of , which is easily proven : since we assumed @xmath14 to be a function of compact support we have , by using the divergence theorem for a large enough volume @xmath51 ( bounded by the surface @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 since @xmath14 vanishes on @xmath52 . by using the identity @xmath54",
    "we thus get .",
    "the starting point is , which can be rewritten by noting that the current density @xmath55 has support on the wire and that @xmath56 , thus @xmath57 by using this expression becomes @xmath58    if we now use with @xmath59 ( component @xmath60 of @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 , remembering that @xmath63 , we get ( no summation over repeated indices ) @xmath64 and by summing over @xmath60 we obtain @xmath65 so the second term of vanishes in an uniform magnetic field .    by using instead @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath62 we get ( again no summation on indices ) @xmath68 and , by means of manipulations analogous to the ones in , we obtain @xmath69 so that @xmath70    by using again the fact that @xmath71 we see by comparison with that @xmath72 and thus reduces to .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that the torque generated by an uniform magnetic field @xmath2 on a wire is given by @xmath73 where the magnetic dipole moment @xmath4 has the following equivalent definitions : @xmath74    it is instructive to go through the different proofs presented of the relation to search for the key ingredients used : from the first proof it is clear that , for a formula like to be valid , the wire must be closed , an aspect whose importance is not completely evident in the usual example of the rectangular wire .",
    "this same requirement is naturally fundamental also for the second proof , since the stokes theorem could not be applied to an open wire , and , although in a less trivial way , it is fundamental also in the third proof : there the main ingredient was current conservation , but the current would not be conserved in an open wire ( see also below ) .",
    "also , in all the proofs , the uniformity of the magnetic field was crucial to carry @xmath2 out of the integration and factorize @xmath4 .",
    "the first form of is usually the most direct one to use in computations involving non - planar wires which are not trivially decomposable into planar ones .",
    "a simple non - trivial example is the wire in , whose parametrization is @xmath75 \\\\ \\rule{0.0cm}{0.5cm}\\hat{x}+\\alpha ( 1-t)\\hat{z } & t\\in(1/2,1 ] \\end{array } \\right . \\ .\\ ] ] it is simple to show that @xmath76 and thus the magnetic dipole moment of the wire parametrized by is @xmath77 which clearly reduce to the planar result @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , when @xmath80 .",
    "various extensions of the result in - can easilly be performed : a particularly simple one is to consider a non - closed wire , i.e. @xmath81 . clearly in this case on the wire it is acting also a net force : from it is immediate to get for the total force the expression @xmath82 and collecting the previously vanishing terms in - we obtain for the torque @xmath83 where now @xmath4 is defined by the first expression in .",
    "since a net force is acting on the wire , the torque depends on the choice of the pole used ( i.e. on the origin of the coordinates in our computation ) and can not in general be written in term of @xmath84 only ; this happens only if we choose the pole in @xmath85 , in which case collapses to @xmath86 this result can be obtained also using the methods of by noting that , for a non - closed wire , the current is not conserved and a source and a sink have to be present at the wire endings : @xmath87    another possible extension is the one to a non uniform magnetic field ( again for a closed wire ) .",
    "let us consider for simplicity only the first linear correction to the uniform field case : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a constant vector and @xmath90 is a linear operator , i.e. in component we have @xmath91 the requirement @xmath92 imposes the restriction @xmath93 and , if we further assume that the currents that generate @xmath2 are far away from the wire ( `` far away '' means here that these currents do not contribute to the various line or surface integrals ) , from @xmath94 the relation @xmath95 follows , i.e. the matrix @xmath90 is symmetric .",
    "since is linear in @xmath2 , we can calculate the corrective term to @xmath1 by simply using @xmath96 .",
    "we than have ( using @xmath26 ) @xmath97_i{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t = a_{ij}\\int_0 ^ 1s_j\\dot{s}_ks_k{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t=\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}a_{ij}\\int_0 ^ 1s_j\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t}(s_k)^2{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t = -\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0 ^ 1(s_k)^2a_{ij}\\dot{s}_j{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}t } \\ ] ] and thus @xmath98 on the other hand @xmath99 and we thus obtain for the torque caused by the non - uniform magnetic field in the expression @xmath100 the second term can be written also as a surface integral , indeed if we use the result of with @xmath2 given by we get @xmath101    clearly in the non - uniform field case also a non - vanishing net force is in general present , which , by using ( remembering that @xmath92 and @xmath94 ) , can be written as @xmath102    if we denote by @xmath103 the modulus of @xmath89 , by @xmath104 a typical value of @xmath90 and we consider a wire of typical linear dimension @xmath105 , the contributions in - are of order @xmath106 and the first of these equations can conveniently be rewritten as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the typical length scale of variation of the magnetic field in .",
    "it is then clear that , as intuitively obvious , the non uniformity of the magnetic field can be neglected as far as @xmath109 .",
    "for dimensional reasons the force in has one power of @xmath105 missing with respect to the torque , but dimensionality would suggests also the presence of a term @xmath110 , which is absent since in an uniform field no net force is acting on the wire . because of the absence of this leading contribution , the non uniformity of the magnetic field can not be neglected even for small wires in the force computation .    for a generic non - uniform magnetic field , is just the first term of a taylor expansion , whose general form is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is symmetric under permutations of @xmath113 .",
    "the condition @xmath92 becomes for the @xmath114th term @xmath115 and the condition @xmath94 gives @xmath116 so that @xmath112 is again completely symmetric and traceless .",
    "it is then not difficult to generalize and .",
    "we can introduce a characteristic length @xmath117 for every term in by @xmath118{\\frac{a^{(0)}}{a^{(n)}}}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 stand here for typical values , and generalizes to @xmath121\\ .\\ ] ] for a typical magnetic field we have @xmath122 and we thus see that the expansion can be truncated to the @xmath114th term if the typical linear dimension of the wire satisfies @xmath123",
    "we discussed three different methods to compute the torque acting on a generic wire in an uniform magnetic field , the first is completely elementary , the other two present a higher degree of mathematical sophistication .",
    "we have then shown how the computation can be generalized to the cases of non - closed wires and non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge paolo christillin and maurizio fagotti for useful comments and discussions .",
    "the stokes theorem relates the circuitation of a field along a closed curve to the flux of its curl : in formulae ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath124 while we are interested in line integrals of the form @xmath125    in order to make use of the stokes theorem in the computation of the r.h.s of , it is convenient to take the scalar product of @xmath126 with a constant vector , which we will denote by @xmath39 : @xmath127\\ , \\ ] ] where in the intermediate step we used the identity @xmath128 and the last identity is just the usual stokes theorem .    passing in components and remembering that @xmath39 is a constant vector",
