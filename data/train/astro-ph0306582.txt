    "the bess ( alloon - borne xperiment with a uperconducting pectrometer ) detector @xcite is a high - resolution spectrometer with a large acceptance to perform highly sensitive searches for rare cosmic - ray components , as well as precise measurement of the absolute fluxes of various cosmic rays .",

    "a 1/@xmath5 resolution of 1.6  % was achieved in this experiment . in order to separate protons and antiprotons from muons ,",
    "the bess spectrometer is equipped with a threshold - type aerogel erenkov counter .",
    "the refractive index of silica aerogel radiator is 1.022 , which corresponds to a threshold kinetic energy of 3.6  gev for protons and antiprotons .",
    "each particle is identified by requiring proper 1/@xmath5 , as well as @xmath6 , as a function of the rigidity .",
    "there are a plastic scintillating counter , an acrylic erenkov counter and a lead plate just above the bottom tof hodoscope .",

    "this simple configuration and the uniform magnetic field result in a large geometrical acceptance and uniform performance in momentum measurement .",

    "the vertical geomagnetic cutoff rigidity is 11.2  gv @xcite .",
    "the observation was performed during two periods of 17th  19th and 21st  23rd of september 1999 . during the observation , the atmospheric depth and temperature varied as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : env ] .",
    "the mean ( root - mean - square ) atmospheric depth and temperature were 742.4 ( 2.9 )  @xmath8 and 10.9 ( 1.1 )  @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the bess detector was operated outside the building and in a nylon plastic sheet tent so as to be less influenced by ambient conditions .",
    "there was no thick material within a field of view of the detector .",
    "a gas flow system was implemented to keep the purity and pressure of the gas inside the chambers stable enough for operation .",
    "the t0-trigger rate was about 50  hz .",
    "it is much lower than that at a usual balloon floating altitude of about 37  km .",
    "thus , all events which satisfied the t0-trigger condition were recorded without imposing second - level trigger nor on - line rejections .",
    "this simple trigger condition reduced systematic errors .",
    "the live - time ratio was as high as 98.8  % through the observation .",
    "the number of collected events was about @xmath10 .",

    "[ fig : pmbe ] shows @xmath11 distribution as a function of rigidity after requiring that there was no light output from the aerogel erenkov counter , so as to discriminate protons and antiprotons from muons .",
    "the procedure of data analysis was almost the same as that of the balloon - flight data @xcite except for a method of evaluating the performance of the aerogel erenkov counter .",
    "the cosmic rays at the balloon altitude are dominated by protons . on the other hand ,",
    "those at mountain altitude consist almost of muons .",
    "therefore the efficiency of the aerogel erenkov counter for protons and antiprotons was not obtained from the observed data in this analysis . the efficiency and its dependence on particle s velocity were estimated by using muons in a lower rigidity range of @xmath12  gv , where muons were identified without contaminations .",
    "the obtained efficiency was applied to protons and antiprotons .",
    "this process arose an additional systematic error of 4  % . in a higher rigidity range of @xmath13",
    "gv , protons and antiprotons were contaminated by muons .",
    "the number of contaminating muons was estimated by multiplying the total number of observed particles by the probability that a muon fakes a proton or an antiproton .",
    "the fake probability was evaluated to be @xmath14 by using energetic particles above 10  gev and the same muon sample as was used for estimating the efficiency of the aerogel erenkov counter .",
    "the muon background amounted to about 20  % for the antiprotons above 2  gev .",
    "it was negligibly small for the protons .    in this analysis ,",
    "the zenith angle @xmath15 was limited as @xmath16 for protons . because of the very small flux of antiprotons , the lower limit of @xmath17 for antiproton analysis was relaxed to be 0.84 so as to improve its statistics .",

    "the first and second errors in tables [ tab : pflux ] and [ tab : pbflux ] represent statistical and systematic errors , respectively .",
    "since the statistics of antiproton measurement was very limited , the statistical error was calculated as a 68.7  % confidence interval based on a `` unified approach '' @xcite .",
    "there is some difference among the proton fluxes observed by various experiments as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pflux ] .",
    "table  [ table : sum_pflux_mountain ] summarizes the locations of cosmic - ray observations at mountain altitude . according to our simple monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the difference was generally explained by the different altitudes and cutoff rigidities .",
    "the overall spectral shape is reproduced by theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "[ fig : zenith - angle - proton - flux ] shows the zenith angle dependence of the observed proton flux , @xmath18 , in two kinetic energy regions . in a simple one - dimensional approximation",
    ", the zenith angle dependence can be expected as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the atmospheric depth at the observation site and @xmath21 is the attenuation length of protons inside the atmosphere .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : zenith - angle - proton - flux ] show the expectation , in which @xmath22 was assumed , since the atmospheric depth was 742.4  @xmath8 and the proton attenuation length is about 120  @xmath8 .",
    "normalization was done by tuning @xmath23 so that the total flux , @xmath24 , is equal to the observed total flux .",
    "relatively good agreement is found between the observed data and the expectation in the higher energy region . in the lower energy region , however , much larger deviation is observed in the zenith angle dependence .",
    "these facts are most likely due to the effect of angular spread of secondary protons produced via nuclear interactions .",
    "this `` three - dimensional effect '' was evaluated by a simple analytic method considering the distribution of transverse momentum at the production point of secondary protons .",
    "the solid lines shown in fig .  [ fig : zenith - angle - proton - flux ] give the results of the analytic calculation , in which the angular spread was taken into account .",
    "they reproduce the observed data in the whole energy range better than the expectation by the one - dimensional calculation . as mentioned above , the proton flux shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pflux ] was obtained by using the events satisfying the zenith angle condition of @xmath16 .",
    "the average zenith angle , @xmath25 , was 0.98 .",
    "the vertical flux @xmath26 was obtained by fitting the observed fluxes using a formula ( [ eq : zenith ] ) , where `` @xmath27 '' was used as a fitting parameter .",
    "the @xmath23 obtained by fitting the data in @xmath28 is summarized in the last column of table  [ tab : pflux ] .",
    "the systematic error due to this fitting procedure was estimated to be around 5  % by checking variations of @xmath23 in changing the fitting regions .",
    "[ fig : pbflux ] shows that the obtained antiproton spectrum above 1  gev is generally consistent with theoretical predictions obtained through transport equation calculations by bowen and moats @xcite and stephens @xcite , as well as through a three - dimensional monte carlo simulation by huang et  al . @xcite . in the lower energy region",
    ", however , the transport equation calculations show significant disagreement with our results .",
    "those three calculations predict similar antiproton spectrum above 0.3  gev at a thin residual atmosphere of 5  @xmath8 , but their predictions do not agree so well with each other at mountain altitude @xcite .",
    "it means that the shapes of antiproton production spectra are very similar to each other , and that the difference at mountain altitude is to be made mainly due to the different treatment of the propagation inside the atmosphere .",
    "the production spectrum of antiprotons has a sharp peak around 2  gev @xcite .",
    "the flux at 0.5  gev is as small as 1/10 of the peak flux .",
    "therefore most antiprotons observed below 1  gev are tertiary antiprotons , those which have been produced inside the atmosphere and then lost their energy during the propagation inside the atmosphere . in this case ,",
    "interaction processes of @xmath29 ( nuclei ) have to be precisely treated for an accurate evaluation of antiproton spectrum at mountain altitude . in the calculation of refs .",
    "@xcite , the probability that an antiproton with initial energy of @xmath30 possesses energy @xmath31 after a collision was assumed to be uniform from @xmath32 to @xmath33 or @xmath34 . on this assumption , the average energy after a collision is about a half of the initial energy . in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , only annihilation channels were taken into account in the inelastic interactions .",
    "non - annihilating inelastic processes were not included as a process of antiproton energy loss , thus a tertiary antiproton remains as energetic as before the interaction .",
    "our result suggests that the non - annihilation process does not make significant contribution to the inelastic interactions of antiprotons during their propagation inside the atmosphere .",
    "thus , the antiprotons are considered not to lose their energy considerably in the non - annihilating inelastic processes .    the antiproton flux measured by sembroski et  al .",
    "@xcite is much higher than our measurements in spite of the similar observational conditions such as altitude ( table  [ table : sum_pflux_mountain ] ) . in that experiment ,",
    "a particle trajectory was measured with six chambers only outside the magnetic field .",
    "no information about the particle trajectory was obtained inside the magnetic field .",
    "it might lead to some difficulty in strict identification of antiprotons .",
    "we have measured proton and antiproton spectra in a kinetic energy range of 0.25  3.5  gev at mt .",
    "norikura , 2,770  m above sea level , in japan .",
    "the vertical geomagnetic cutoff rigidity is 11.2  gv . the mean atmospheric depth during the measurement was 742.4  @xmath8 .",
    "the measured proton spectrum is consistent with the previous results , if the different altitudes and cutoff rigidities at their observation sites are taken into account .",
    "the zenith angle dependence of the proton flux was observed .",
    "it suggests importance of a three - dimensional effect of the angular spread in secondary baryon productions especially in a low energy region .",
    "the measured antiproton flux above 1  gev generally agrees with the theoretical predictions . in the lower energy region , however , our flux shows much better agreement with the calculation performed in assuming that tertiary antiprotons remain as energetic as before interactions .",
