    "rapidly developing trend in nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity and string theory , which is based on holographic ideas of ads / cft correspondence @xcite , involves vasiliev theory of interacting higher spin fields @xcite and naturally leads to the notion of conformal higher spin fields ( chs ) @xcite .",
    "though these chs fields represent thus far only a playground for rather sophisticated verification of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , quite interestingly they turn out to be important in recent cosmological applications associated with the problem of initial conditions in the early inflationary universe @xcite .",
    "this is the model of the cft driven cosmology @xcite which incorporates two main ideas  a new concept of the cosmological microcanonical density matrix as the initial state of the universe and the implementation of this concept in cosmology with a large number of quantum fields conformally coupled to gravity .",
    "this model plays important role within quantum cosmology and within the cosmological constant and dark energy problems .",
    "in particular , it resolves the issue of infrared catastrophe associated with the observer independent treatment of the no - boundary state @xcite  an anti - intuitive conclusion that the origin of an infinitely big universe ( with an insufficient amount of inflation produced at the zero minimum of the inflaton potential rather than its maximum ) is infinitely more probable than that of a finite one .",
    "another property is that its statistical ensemble is bounded to a finite range of values of the effective cosmological constant @xcite and gives rise to a new type of hill - top inflation @xcite .",
    "also this model incorporates a certain version of the ds / cft holographic duality @xcite and is potentially capable of generating the cosmological acceleration phenomenon within the so - called big boost scenario @xcite .",
    "the setting of the initial conditions problem is based on canonical quantization of gravity theory and a natural notion of the microcanonical density matrix as a projector on the space of solutions of the quantum gravitational dirac constraints  the system of the wheeler - dewitt equations @xcite .",
    "its statistical sum has a representation of the euclidean quantum gravity ( eqg ) path integral @xcite @xmath8\\ ;      e^{-s[\\,g_{\\mu\\nu},\\varphi\\ , ] } ,          \\label{z }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] over metric @xmath9 and matter fields @xmath10 which are periodic on the euclidean spacetime with a time compactified to a circle @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath18 , gauss - bonnet term @xmath19 and weyl tensor squared @xmath20  are determined by the cft particle content .",
    "these coefficients are additive sums of contributions of all conformal fields of different spins @xmath21 . in particular",
    ", the coefficient @xmath0 of the gauss - bonnet term , which is of major interest in what follows , reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a partial contribution of spin @xmath21 conformal field and @xmath24 is the number of such fields in the set of all @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting @xmath16 $ ] becomes the sum of the anomaly contribution and a free energy of conformal matter fields on the sphere @xmath25 at the temperature determined by the period of the euclidean time .",
    "then the physics of the cft driven cosmology is entirely determined by the effective action ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "solutions of its equations of motion , which give a saddle point of the statistical sum path integral , are the cosmological instantons of @xmath26 topology with the friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xmath27 where a periodic lapse function @xmath28 and scale factor @xmath29 are the functions of the euclidean time belonging on @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these instantons serve as initial conditions for the cosmological evolution @xmath30 in the physical lorentzian signature spacetime , which follows from @xmath29 by analytic continuation @xmath31 at the point of the maximum value of the euclidean scale factor @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 of the gauss - bonnet term in ( [ anomaly ] ) plays especially important role because it imposes an upper bound on the range of @xmath12 within which these instantons exist , @xmath33 the fact that these instantons exist only in the finite range of @xmath12 implies the restriction of the microcanonical ensemble of universes to this range , which from the viewpoint of string theory can , in particular , be interpreted as the solution of the landscape problem for stringy vacua if one assumes that this model is a low energy approximation of the string theory .",
    "as was recently shown in @xcite , this model with the fundamental cosmological constant can be generalized to the case when the role of an effective @xmath12 is simulated by the hill like potential of the inflaton scalar field @xmath34 in the regime of the slow roll approximation , @xmath35 .",
    "then the cft driven cosmology can be regarded as a source of the new type of hill - top inflation scenario . in particular",
    ", it can provide initial conditions for the starobinsky model of @xmath5-inflation @xcite or the model of higgs inflation with the higgs boson playing the role of the inflaton non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty with this scenario is the problem of hierarchy between the sub - planckian energy scale of inflation  the inflaton energy density @xmath36 @xcite compatible with current cmb observational data @xcite  and the energy scale of the cft driven cosmology ( [ bound ] ) . to match these energy scales",
    "one needs the value of @xmath37 . in the standard model or its gut generalizations containing only three low spin fields , which can be conformally coupled to gravity , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "this is of course impossible .",
    "their contribution to @xmath0 @xmath41 can reach such a magnitude only by the price of unnaturally high numbers of these particle species .",
    "hidden sector of @xmath42 low spin particles sounds too unrealistic to be physically acceptable .",
    "hidden sector of numerous , actually infinitely many , particles is possible in string theory which is believed to underlie the effective quantum field theory and quantum gravity .",
    "however , these particles are massive , of the planckian scale mass , and can not incorporate local conformal invariance which is a corner stone of the cft cosmology . on the other hand , there is a growing believe that string theory can be a broken phase of the vasiliev theory of higher spin gauge fields @xcite , which was recently very actively considered in various tests of ads / cft correspondence including very wide implications of _ conformal higher spin _ ( chs ) field models @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to try as a hidden weakly interacting sector of the cft cosmology the tower of these chs fields , that could provide a large value of @xmath0 .",
    "though very speculative , in view of problems with unitarity for higher spins , this idea is strongly motivated by the recent observation that the partial contributions @xmath23 to ( [ 101 ] ) very rapidly grow with spin as @xmath43 @xcite , so that the needed value can be attained with the finite tower of hsc fields up to @xmath44 containing @xmath45 polarizations @xcite . therefore , the replacement of multiple species of the same spin by a tower of higher spins is a much more efficient mechanism for large @xmath0 , and the goal of this paper is to discuss this mechanism and its possible consequences .",
    "the concept of a hidden sector of chs fields allows one to solve another important problem in the cft cosmology .",
    "it suggests the mechanism protecting the theory from uncontrollable contribution of perturbatively nonrenormalizable graviton loops .",
    "this is achieved by bringing the maximal energy scale of the above cosmological instantons ( [ bound ] ) below the gravitational cutoff . with the definition of this cutoff as the scale under which _ only _",
    "the contribution of the _ graviton _ loops ( loops containing at least one graviton propagator ) is suppressed , there arises a strong distinction between the number of quantum species @xmath1 and the cft central charge @xmath46 which participate in the expressions for a conventional gravitational cutoff @xmath47 @xcite and the inflation scale @xmath48 corresponding to ( [ bound ] ) . in models of multiple quantum species the cutoff is usually defined as the scale below which the _ total _ one - loop contribution to the graviton propagator is smaller than the tree - level part @xcite , and this leads to the cutoff @xmath49 which is not distinguishable from @xmath50 in simple models , but can be very different when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are very different in magnitude .",
    "our definition of the cutoff which involves smallness of only the graviton loop corrections leads to the expression @xmath51 which can be much higher than @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and this is exactly the case of chs fields . in this way we develop the approximation scheme in which the nonrenormalizable graviton sector is subject to effective field theory under the cutoff @xmath3 , whereas the renormalizable sector of multiple conformal species is treated beyond perturbation theory .",
    "there are several other interesting features associated with the contribution of higher spins to the conformal anomaly ( [ anomaly ] ) .",
    "first , unlike for the case of lower spins @xmath23 is negative for fermionic fields with @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this means that overall @xmath0 in cft cosmology can be negative , and this essentially modifies its scenario .",
    "secondly , irrespective of the sign of @xmath23 one can construct the zeta - function regularized sum over infinite set of spins of chs fields ( described by totally symmetric bosonic tensors or fermionic spin - tensors ) which yields overall zero value of the total @xmath0 in ( [ 101 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this nontrivial manifestation of the ads / cft correspondence is conjectured to underlie hypothetical free of trace anomalies  and therefore quantum consistent ",
    "fundamental theory that might be based on the fusion of string theory and vasiliev gauge theory of higher spins .",
    "motivated by the prospect of solving the hierarchy problem via chs fields we consider peculiarities of cosmological scenario driven by their finite tower in case of both positive and negative @xmath0 and by the anomaly free chs theory with an infinite set of fields .",
    "the effective action of the cft driven cosmology ( [ eff ] ) on the frw metric ( [ frw ] ) with @xmath26 topology ,",
    "@xmath55\\equiv s_{\\rm eff}[\\,a , n\\,]$ ] , was obtained by the conformal transformation to the static einstein universe @xcite with a compactified euclidean time .",
    "it consists of the minisuperspace reduced einstein term , riegert - fradkin - tseytlin action @xcite and the contribution of the einstein static spacetime ",
    "free energy of conformal fields and their vacuum casimir energy . in units of the rescaled planck mass @xmath56 it reads @xcite @xmath57=m_p^2\\int_{s^1 }",

    "the first three terms in curly brackets of ( [ effaction0 ] ) represent the einstein action with a fundamental cosmological constant @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the corresponding hubble parameter ) .",
    "the constant @xmath61 is a coefficient of the contributions of the conformal anomaly and vacuum ( casimir ) energy @xmath62 on a conformally related static einstein spacetime .",
    "it is proportional to the coefficient @xmath0 of the gauss - bonnet term @xmath63 in the trace anomaly of conformal matter fields ( [ anomaly ] ) @xmath64 the free energy @xmath65 of the set of all conformal fields labelled by their spin @xmath21 also comes from this einstein space , @xmath66 this is a typical boson or fermion sum over field oscillators with energies @xmath67 on a unit 3-sphere , @xmath68 denoting the number of physical polarizations of a spin-@xmath21 field , which is negative for fermions , @xmath69 .",
    "the role of the temperature is played here by the inverse of @xmath70  an overall circumference of @xmath11 in the @xmath26 instanton in units of the conformal time ( [ period ] ) .",
    "the effective action is independent of the anomaly coefficient @xmath71 , because it is assumed that @xmath71 is renormalized to zero by a local counterterm , @xmath72 this guarantees the absence of higher derivative terms in ( [ effaction0 ] ) @xcite  non - ghost nature of the scale factor  and simultaneously shifts the uv renormalized casimir energy ( which universally expresses in terms of anomaly coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath0 @xcite ) to a partiular value independent of @xmath71 and proportional to @xmath73 @xcite ,- model which also provides the inflaton mode simulating a slowly varying cosmological term which decays at the exit from inflation @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath74 both of these properties are critically important for the instanton solutions of effective equations .",
    "the coefficient @xmath75 of the weyl tensor term @xmath76 also does not enter ( [ effaction0 ] ) because @xmath77 identically vanishes for any frw metric .    the statistical sum ( [ z ] )",
    "is dominated by solutions of the effective equation , @xmath78 , which in the gauge @xmath79 reads @xmath80 this is the modification of the euclidean friedmann equation by the anomalous @xmath61-term and the radiation term @xmath81 .",
    "the constant @xmath82 here characterizes the sum of the casimir energy and the energy of thermally excited particles with the inverse temperature @xmath70 given by ( [ period ] ) , @xmath83 it is a nonlocal functional of the history @xmath29  the equation ( [ bootstrap ] ) plays the role of the bootstrap equation for the amount of radiation which is determined by the background on top of which this radiation evolves and produces back reaction .",
    "the quadratic equation ( [ efeq ] ) can be solved for @xmath84 , @xmath85 where the positive sign of the square root is chosen to provide a periodic oscillation of @xmath86 between its maximal and minimal values @xmath87 . in order to guarantee",
    "that at @xmath88 is a turning point with a vanishing @xmath89 the value @xmath90 should satisfy the bound @xmath91 .",
    "this gives the first two restrictions on the range of @xmath92 and @xmath82 @xmath93 whereas the third one follows from the requirement of real turning points @xmath87 , @xmath94    there are two sets of solutions of this integro - differential equation @xcite .",
    "the main set consists of periodic @xmath95 instantons with the oscillating scale factor  _ garlands _ that can be regarded as the thermal version of the hartle - hawking instantons .",
    "the scale factor oscillates @xmath96 times ( @xmath97 ) between the maximum and minimum values ( [ apm ] ) , @xmath98 , so that the full period of the conformal time ( [ period ] ) is the @xmath99-multiple of the integral between the two neighboring turning points of @xmath29 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 this value of @xmath70 is finite and determines effective temperature @xmath102 as a function of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is the artifact of a microcanonical ensemble in cosmology @xcite with only two freely specifiable dimensional parameters  the gravitational and cosmological constants .    according to ( [ hbound ] )",
    "these garland - type instantons exist only in the limited range of the cosmological constant @xmath104 @xcite . in view of ( [ hbound ] ) and ( [ uppercbound ] ) they belong to the domain in the two - dimensional plane of the hubble constant @xmath92 and the amount of radiation constant @xmath82 . in this domain they form an countable , @xmath105 , sequence of one - parameter families  curves interpolating between the lower straight line boundary @xmath106 and the upper hyperbolic boundary @xmath107 .",
    "each curve corresponds to a respective @xmath96-fold instantons of the above type .",
    "therefore , the range of admissible values of @xmath12 , @xmath108 has a band structure , each band @xmath109 being a projection of the @xmath96-th curve to the @xmath92 axis .",
    "the sequence of bands of ever narrowing widths with @xmath110 accumulates at the upper bound of this range @xmath111 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath112  the lowest point of @xmath113 family  can be obtained numerically for any field content of the model .",
    "another set of solutions follows from rewriting the effective equation ( [ efeq ] ) in the form ( retaining in contrast to ( [ maineq ] ) both signs of the square root ) @xmath114 and noting that for @xmath115 it reduces to @xcite ( without radiation contribution in lorentzian signature spacetime this solution was derived in @xcite ) @xmath116 obviously the solutions to these two equations , @xmath117 , represent spherical euclidean instantons @xmath118 of the radii @xmath119 respectively , or the strings of such spheres touching each other at their poles and forming a  _ necklace _ \" with any number of such spherical beads @xcite .",
    "note that the value of @xmath115 is consistent with the bootstrap equation ( [ bootstrap ] ) , because the time period for such a necklace consisting of @xmath96 beads , @xmath120 diverges at the poles of spherical beads , where they touch each other  the range of integration over @xmath86 in contrast to eq.([period1 ] ) is a multiple of the range between @xmath121 at the pole of the 4-sphere @xmath118 and its value @xmath119 at the equator of @xmath118 .",
    "therefore both @xmath65 and @xmath122 vanish and give in view of ( [ bootstrap ] ) the value of @xmath115 .",
    ", width=264 ]    these vacuum ( or zero temperature , @xmath123 ) necklace instantons existing for all values of @xmath124 are , however , uninteresting because their contribution to the statistical sum is suppressed to zero by their infinite _ positive _ euclidean action .",
    "for @xmath125 the on - shell value of the action ( [ effaction0 ] ) , @xmath126 diverges to @xmath127 at the poles of necklace beads with @xmath121 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "thus the cft cosmology scenario is free from the infrared catastrophe of vacuum no - boundary instantons , which would otherwise have a _ negative _ tree - level euclidean action ( proportional to @xmath130 at @xmath131 ) and which would imply that the origin of an infinitely big universe is infinitely more probable than that of a finite one .",
    "elimination of this infrared catastrophe is the quantum effect of the trace anomaly which flips the sign of the effective action and sends it to @xmath127 .",
    "goes over into two different points of @xmath132 , @xmath133 , with equal field values .",
    "[ fig.2],width=264 ]    the explanation why the trace anomaly action does not produce the same effect for the no - boundary prescription of hartle and hawking consists in the observation @xcite that the density matrix prescription in the cft cosmology , despite the same @xmath132-geometry of the cosmological instanton , has boundary conditions other than those of the no - boundary case",
    ". graphical representation of the origin of the periodic garland instanton from the density matrix , whose two arguments are associated with spatial hypersurfaces @xmath134 and @xmath135 , is demonstrated on fig.1 for a single - fold case .",
    "analogous single - bead necklace instanton originates by a similar procedure shown on fig.2 .",
    "it implies that prior to transition to the statistical sum the values of the fields on two hemispheres should coincide at the point where these hemispheres touch . after tracing out the fields at the identified surfaces @xmath136 the hemispheres",
    "get glued into a complete @xmath132 instanton , but its antipodal pole points should still be identified as well as their field values @xmath137 .",
    "this is the additional boundary condition which is absent in the conventional no - boundary prescription . and",
    ", as shown in @xcite , path integration over the quantum field on a generic euclidean manifold with the identification of values of this field at two spacetime points leads to the suppression of the result to zero by its one - loop prefactor .",
    "this result strongly relies on positivity of the classical euclidean action or unitarity , which is apparently related to the positivity of @xmath138 in the above derivation .",
    "the main motivation for introducing chs fields in cosmology is an attempt of solving the hierarchy problem .",
    "realistic cft driven cosmology capable of generating a finite inflationary stage arises by the generalization of the model ( [ tree0 ] ) to the case of effective cosmological term with a slowly varying @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath12 is simulated by a potential @xmath139 of a dynamical scalar field @xmath34  the inflaton in the regime of the slow roll from the slope of @xmath139 .",
    "such a model of a new hill - top inflation scenario was recently built in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the slow roll conditions  smallness of inflationary parameters @xmath140 and @xmath70 , which determine the properties of the primordial cmb power spectrum @xcite , are satisfied for those models which are very close to the upper boundary of the effective cosmological constant range ( [ lambda_range ] ) .",
    "this leads to a major difficulty in a realistic inflationary scenario  the problem of hierarchy between the planckian scale of this bound and the estimates for the scale of inflation based on the cmb data in the models which provide a good fit of these data @xcite . here",
    "we show that using chs fields suggests a solution to this hierarchy problem and , moreover , provides a mechanism protecting the obtained results from the contribution of nonrenormalizable graviton loops .",
    "two models which perhaps give the best fit are the starobinsky @xmath5-inflation model and quantitatevely very close to it higgs inflation model with a large non - minimal coupling of the higgs inflaton to curvature @xcite . in particular , the latter model establishes a very convincing relation between the observable cmb spectral parameter @xmath141 and the value of the higgs mass very close to the one discovered at lhc @xcite .    for higgs inflation with a large non - minimal coupling the energy density ( in the einstein frame of fields ) at the start of inflation should be essentially sub - planckian , @xmath142 @xcite . matching with the upper bound ( [ lambda_range ]",
    ") @xmath143 implies that the total beta must be of the order of magnitude @xmath144 in order to reach this value with the conventional low spin particle phenomenology characteristic of the standard model one would need unrealistically high numbers of conformal invariant scalar bosons @xmath145 , dirac fermions @xmath146 and vector bosons @xmath147 in the expression ( [ 100 ] ) for @xmath0 .",
    "hidden sector of so numerous low spin weakly interacting particles does not seem to be realistic . however , unification of interactions inspired by the ideas of string theory , holographic duality @xcite and higher spin gauge theory @xcite suggests that this hidden sector might contain conformal higher spin ( chs ) fields described by totally symmetric tensors and spin - tensors @xcite , and the total value of @xmath0 consists of the additive sum of all their partial contributions ( [ 101 ] ) .",
    "recently there was essential progress in the theory of these fields .",
    "in particular , it was advocated in @xcite that the values of @xmath23 can be explicitly calculated for both bosons and dirac fermions of a generic spin @xmath21 .",
    "they read @xmath148 where @xmath68 is their respective number of dynamical degrees of freedom ",
    "polarizations ( negative for fermions ) .",
    "violates the rule ( [ boson ] ) which is valid for @xmath149 . ]",
    "though these fields serve now basically as a playground for holographic ads / cft duality issues and suffer from the problems of perturbative unitarity , which is anticipated to be restored only at the non - perturbative level , . ]",
    "it is worth trying to exploit them as a possible solution of hierarchy problem in the cft driven cosmology .",
    "strong motivation for this is that partial contributions of individual higher spins rapidly grow with the spin as @xmath43 , so that the tower of spins up to some large @xmath150 generates the total value of @xmath0 @xmath151 ( for simplicity we consider only bosons and assume that every higher spin species is taken only once , @xmath152 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to provide the hierarchy bound ( [ beta_bound ] ) the maximal spin should be @xmath153 , which corresponds to the following estimate of the total number of particle modes ( polarizations ) in the hidden sector of the theory @xmath154 when , instead of a tower of spins , the cosmological model is driven by a conformal field of an individual spin @xmath155 with @xmath156 and @xmath157 , then the needed value of spin and the number of polarizations are @xmath158    quite interestingly , in the case of ( [ beta])-([nu ] ) this coincides with the estimate for the average value of @xmath0 per one conformal degree of freedom , @xmath159 at which the thermal correction to the spectral parameter of cmb , @xmath160 , depending on the properties of the hill like inflaton potential might appear in its third decimal order @xcite  the precision anticipated to be reachable in the next generation of cmb observations following planck . for the case of the individual spin ( [ ind_spin ] )",
    "the thermal correction is even stronger and can appear in the second or even the first decimal order .",
    "this means that a potential resolution of the hierarchy problem in the cft scenario via chs simultaneously would make measurable the thermal contribution to the cmb red tilt , which is complementary to the conventional tilt caused by the deviation of the slow roll evolution from the exact de sitter evolution @xcite .",
    "chs fields provide a mechanism which does not only solve the phenomenological problem of hierarchy between the planckian and inflation scales , but is also likely to justify the approximation underlying the predictions of the above type .",
    "as mentioned in introduction this approximation goes beyond semiclassical expansion , because its subleading one - loop order is critically important for the construction of the model . in particular",
    ", it contributes a large one - loop contribution whose balance against the tree - level part establishes the upper bound ( [ bound ] ) on the energy scale of inflation .",
    "therefore , the inflation scale @xmath161 is deeply below the planck scale for a large @xmath0 generated by large numbers of quantum species @xmath24,@xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "this seems to imply validity of the semiclassical expansion in which all graviton loops can be disregarded .",
    "however , there is a problem associated with the fact that quantum gravity with a large number @xmath1 of quantum species has the effective field theory cutoff @xmath164 which decreases for growing @xmath1 along with the scale ( [ lambdai ] ) and can be even higher than the latter .",
    "this is a well known statement based on perturbation theory arguments @xcite or implications of the hawking radiation from a semiclassical black hole @xcite . within a conventional perturbation theory",
    "this completely breaks the predictions in our model , because we can not guarantee smallness of quantum corrections due to nonrenormalizable graviton loops ",
    "the theory is not protected from uncontrollable radiative corrections .",
    "the origin of the gravitational cutoff ( [ cutoff ] ) , below which a nonrenormalizable contribution of graviton loops can be disregarded , is based on the following reasoning .",
    "suppose we have @xmath1 quantum species which generate in the external gravitational field a full set of feynman diagrams .",
    "inclusion of quantum graviton loops consists in the insertion into these diagrams graviton propagators with the relevant vertices of gravity - matter interaction .",
    "each graviton propagator carries extra factor of @xmath165 which suppresses a relevant background quantity of the scale @xmath166  a spacetime curvature or a second order spacetime derivative . with a small @xmath167 number of quantum fields the suppression factor for this contribution would be @xmath168 which implies a standard planck scale cutoff @xmath169",
    "however , with many quantum fields this contribution gets enhanced .    for noninteracting multiple species the above contribution",
    "is multiplied by the first power of @xmath1 , since the graviton propagator connects two vertices of one and the same field .",
    "this is because another matter field propagator , connecting these vertices , for free ( linear ) fields can connect only the vertices of one and the same species , whereas another graviton propagator which could have connected vertices of different fields would give ( together with the first added propagator ) a subdominant contribution @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , the overall suppression factor for the insertion of any single graviton propagator becomes @xmath171 , and the cutoff equals ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "matrix propagator of quantum species can be non - diagonal ) , so that the suppression factor equals @xmath172 and the cutoff seemingly reduces to @xmath173 .",
    "but off - diagonal elements should carry the coupling constant which should scale as @xmath174 to guarantee perturbative regime in the matter field sector , and this raises @xmath175 back to the non - interacting case of ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "i am grateful to s.sibiryakov for the discussion of this point . ]",
    "thus , a hidden sector of multiple quantum species does not help to protect the model from unrenormalizable graviton corrections .",
    "its energy scale @xmath2 with @xmath176 either coincides with the gravitational cutoff ( [ cutoff ] ) or even exceeds it .",
    "this is the consequence of the universality of the gravitational interaction  no matter how small is the coupling of the hidden sector to observable sector , universal gravitational interaction can not be reduced below the gravitational cutoff .",
    "it should be emphasized here that in the above derivation of the gravitational cutoff we did not require smallness of the _ full _ quantum ( say one - loop ) correction relative to the tree - level part as it was done in @xcite . in the perturbation theory approach of @xcite",
    "this would have led instead of @xmath1 to the central charge of the theory ",
    "the relevant coefficient of the conformal anomaly @xmath46 , and the cutoff would be @xmath2 .",
    "rather , in our definition of the cutoff we demanded smallness of only the graviton corrections  all nonrenormalizable contributions containing any single graviton propagator . on the contrary , the contribution of purely quantum species loops can be large and treated beyond perturbation theory , as it was done in the construction of cosmological instantons above . with this definition",
    "the cutoff is inverse proportional to @xmath177 rather than @xmath178 .",
    "for conventional low spin theories these two quantities are of the same order of magnitude and are usually not distinguished from one another in the cutoff expression .",
    "remarkable property of chs fields is that they qualitatively change this situation .",
    "this is because for this theory  either for an individual sufficiently high spin @xmath21 or for a tower of spins up to some @xmath179 ",
    "the parameter @xmath0 grows with the spin much faster than the number of fields . for an individual spin",
    "@xmath21 the role of the number of quantum species is played now by the number of polarizations @xmath157 , while for a tower of spins ( for bosonic case with every spin taken once ) it is @xmath180 correspondingly , the total value of @xmath0 equals @xmath181 for an individual spin and @xmath182 , see eq.([beta ] ) , for such a tower of spins .",
    "therefore the ratio of the inflation scale ( [ lambdai ] ) to the cutoff ( [ cutoff ] ) is decreasing with the growth of the individual spin @xmath21 or the height of the spin tower @xmath150 respectively as which should equally enter the expressions for the inflation scale ( [ lambdai ] ) , cf . eq.([bound ] ) , and the gravitational cutoff ( [ cutoff ] ) and , therefore , cancel out in their ratio . ]",
    "@xmath183 where the inflation scales and cutoffs labeled by @xmath21 and @xmath150 obviously denote the cases of the individual spin or a tower of those . in both cases of the individual spin ( [ ind_spin ] ) , @xmath184 , and the tower of spins ( [ beta])-([nu ] ) , @xmath153 , these ratios are very small and range within the limits @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the model is in the quantum state three or four orders of magnitude below its gravitational cutoff , and an uncontrollable contribution of nonrenormalizable graviton loops is negligible .    for strongly coupled species with the cutoff @xmath173 mentioned above ( see footnote 4 )",
    "these ratios are higher @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and amount to @xmath188 .",
    "so for a tower of spins , @xmath153 , the system becomes too close to the gravitational cutoff .",
    "this case is , however , not so important because ( non - diagonal ) propagator mixing between the chs species is possible only on the nonzero background of these fields , whereas we assume that in conformal cosmology it is vanishing ",
    "conformal species have vanishing expectation values and contribute only via their quantum fluctuations .",
    "thus the model is deeply below the gravitational cutoff , and we remain with the dominant quantum contribution of only the chs fields in the external gravitational field .",
    "this contribution is big , because it is weighted by @xmath53 , and it is treated beyond perturbation theory . for linear fields",
    "it is exhausted by the one - loop order , which is exactly calculable for the frw metric by the trace anomaly method described above .",
    "the generalization to a nonlinear case also looks straightforward .",
    "it is important that this sector is perturbatively renormalizable , which is obvious for low spin fields @xmath189 , while for higher order spins it directly follows from their higher - derivative nature ",
    "the conformal field of spin @xmath21 has a kinetic operator of order @xmath190 @xcite . due to renormalizability gravitational multi - loop counterterms",
    "are exhausted by the same three tensor invariants as in the one - loop order , @xmath20 , @xmath63 and @xmath18 ( @xmath5 is absent due to conformal invariance ) which generate the three - parameter trace anomaly ( [ anomaly ] ) , and the principal effect of nonlinearity is a slow logarithmic rg running of @xmath71 , @xmath0 and @xmath75 @xcite . moreover , for the frw background this sector is actually free from _ logarithmic _ uv divergences , because on this closed @xmath26 instanton the counterterms  @xmath191 , the euler number ( contributed by the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath63 ) as well as @xmath192  are all vanishing .",
    "thus , this sector of the model is free from uv divergences , and its power divergences are absorbed by the renormalization of the cosmological @xmath12 and gravitational @xmath193 coupling constants .",
    "it is in terms of these two _ renormalized _ constants and without any renormalization ambiguity that the frw cosmological instantons were built within the dynamically suppressed energy scale ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath5-term of the starobinsky model , considered above ( [ alpha_renorm ] ) and used for a _",
    "finite _ renormalization of the casimir energy ( [ casimir_renorm ] ) and simulation of the effective cosmological term @xcite , belongs to uv finite sector .",
    "therefore , elimination of higher - derivative ghosts in the gravitational sector by this finite renormalization can not be broken by leading radiative corrections , which justifies the criterion of  naturalness \" in this model .",
    "eq.([fermion ] ) shows that when the model is dominated by chs fermions the total @xmath0 and @xmath61 can be negative , because fermionic @xmath23 are negative starting with @xmath194 .",
    "apparently , this is associated with the fact that hsc fields are not free from ghosts  their kinetic operator contains higher derivatives of order @xmath190 .",
    "there exist a hope that at the nonperturbative level chs theories can be rendered unitarity , so that there effect can still be interesting within the cft cosmology scenario .",
    "the picture of this scenario with a negative @xmath61 is somewhat different from the case of @xmath125 and looks as follows .",
    "first consider the garland instantons .",
    "for a negative @xmath195 the equation ( [ maineq ] ) should be chosen in the form with the negative sign of the square root @xmath196 if we want periodic oscillations between @xmath88 and @xmath197 . here",
    "the argument of the square root equals @xmath198 and is positive definite , and also no restrictions on the range of @xmath92 and @xmath82 similar to ( [ hbound ] ) follow .",
    "apriori , in the two dimensional plane of @xmath199 and @xmath200 garland instanton solutions can occupy all points below the hyperbola @xmath107 .",
    "however , the bootstrap equation ( [ bootstrap ] ) with a negative @xmath61 imposes the upper bound on the value of the conformal time period of garland instantons , and this leads to a reduction of this domain .",
    "the constant @xmath82 can not be negative because @xmath90 should be positive for garlands , so that the range @xmath201 gives , in view of @xmath202 being a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath70 , a restriction on the domain of possible",
    "@xmath70 @xmath203 this immediately rules out solutions belonging to @xmath92 and @xmath82 axes of the curvilinear triangle , because both for @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) and @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) the time period is infinite , which contradicts @xmath208 .",
    "similarly , the asymptotics @xmath209 can not be reached along the upper hyperbolic boundary , @xmath107 , because the bootstrap equation would imply that @xmath210 and @xmath211 ( in view of bosonic contributions to @xmath202 tending to infinity for vanishing @xmath70 ) .",
    "but this is impossible because at this boundary the conformal time period is exactly calculable the turning points @xmath87 approach each other and the integral for @xmath70 becomes exactly calculable @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite and equals @xmath212 the values of @xmath92 are also bounded from above because for @xmath213 the conformal time period @xmath214 , and large @xmath60 are also ruled out by the maximal value of @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast to the case of positive @xmath61 , however , the upper bound on the cosmological constant is not universal and can be obtained only numerically .",
    "thus , negative @xmath61 rules out infrared catastrophe in the distribution of garland type cosmological models with @xmath209 , because there are no corresponding garland instantons in this limit .",
    "this restricts the range of the cosmological constant from above .",
    "one would think that the upper limit on @xmath70 might also bound the value of @xmath92 and solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "say , on the hyperbolic boundary with @xmath215 it reads @xmath216 .",
    "but this bound turns out to be to weak to provide @xmath217 , unless the value of @xmath218 in @xmath219 is very big , which again implies a high tower of fermionic chs .",
    "the domain of negative @xmath82 and @xmath61 in ( [ bootstrap ] ) corresponds to _ necklace _",
    "instantons described above in sect.2 . for @xmath220",
    "the value of @xmath90 is also negative , so that a sensible minimal value of the scale factor is actually zero .",
    "this does not lead to a contradiction with ( [ negativeb ] ) , because the conformal time @xmath70 in view of eq.([period2 ] ) diverges to infinity at the lower limit and @xmath221 , so that the geometry smoothly closes at @xmath121 without a conical singularity to form a round sphere @xmath222 ( or a necklace  the string of round spheres ) for all positive @xmath92 .",
    "however , in contrast to necklace instantons with a positive @xmath61 they are not ruled out by their on - shell effective action ( [ action - instanton ] ) because @xmath223 and the action is infinitely negative @xmath224 . note that this divergence occurs not at a particular value of @xmath92  the statistical sum is badly defined for all values of @xmath92 , and the situation is qualitatively different from the no - boundary state .",
    "therefore , the cosmology with @xmath225 is in principle inconsistent , because its full statistical sum contains this divergent contribution of necklace instantons .",
    "the additional ensemble of garland instantons , discussed above , contributes to the statistical sum a finite part , but it is hard to interpret it on top of the divergent part of the necklace distribution .",
    "another interesting case of chs theory is the infinitely high tower of spins @xmath226 . in this case",
    "the total @xmath0 and other characteristics of the chs tower are formally divergent , but in the case when all spin particles are taken only once , @xmath152 , the use of @xmath227-function regularization for the divergent spin series gives a remarkable result  an overall @xmath61 becomes zero @xcite , @xmath228 this result holds independently for boson , @xmath229 , and fermion , @xmath230 @xcite , chs towers and underlies a non - trivial check of the @xmath231-correspondence in which the vanishing result on the 5-dimensional ads side simply follows from the absence of conformal anomaly in odd - dimensional spacetime .    explicit summation over spins is possible not only for trace anomaly coefficients but also for the thermal free energies of chs particles @xcite .",
    "this can be done by expanding the logarithm in ( [ freeenergy ] ) in the sum over  one - particle \" statistical sums @xmath232 with growing inverse temperature @xmath233 and interchanging the order of summation over spins and equidistant levels of the inverse temperature , @xmath234 explicit summation of @xmath235 over spin @xmath21 gives the answer @xcite @xmath236 which gives a good approximation for the sum over @xmath96 in the limit of large @xmath70 .",
    "irrespective of this approximation , the answer for the total free energy , given by this convergent sum over @xmath96 , has important property ",
    "unexpectedly it is negative .",
    "similarly for fermions @xmath237 therefore , both bosonic and fermionic theories of chs have negative thermal energy densities @xmath202 .",
    "obviously , this unnatural conclusion is the result of the oversubtraction performed by the @xmath227-function renormalization of @xcite which annihilates all uv divergences in the infinite sum over spins .",
    "this is clearly seen in the special cutoff regularization by the parameter",
    "@xmath238 @xmath239 this regularization retains power divergences which give a dominant positive contribution , while the @xmath227-function regularization subtracts these divergences and leaves us with the negative remnant .",
    "potential justification for this property could be a conjectured nonperturbative treatment of such theories which solves the problem of their unitarity .",
    "we will see now that outside of this nonperturbative approach these models recover the situation of the vacuum no - boundary instantons with the infrared catastrophe of @xmath131 .    indeed , for @xmath240 and @xmath241 eqs .",
    "( [ efeq])-([bootstrap ] ) lead to a negative @xmath220 , so that the turning points ( [ apm ] ) can not be both positive . similarly",
    "to the situation a negative @xmath82 above , the negative value of @xmath90 implies that the minimal value of the scale factor is zero , which does not lead to a conical singularity of the solution at @xmath205 , because the conformal time @xmath70 in view of ( [ period1 ] ) diverges to infinity and @xmath242 .",
    "the solution becomes @xmath243 , which represents the hartle - hawking instanton @xmath132 . in view of the overall @xmath61 equal to zero ,",
    "the on - shell action ( [ action - instanton ] ) does not diverge ",
    "its integral term is finite for all @xmath92 .",
    "it coincides with the tree - level action of the no - boundary instanton  the 4-sphere of the radius @xmath244  and diverges to @xmath245 at @xmath209 , @xmath246 .",
    "our main conclusion is that cosmology with numerous chs fields can solve the problem of hierarchy between the planck scale and the subplanckian inflationary scale compatible with cmb observations within a number of inflation models including @xmath5-gravity and higgs inflation model @xcite .",
    "for that a finite height tower of bosonic and fermionic chs fields should generate a large positive coefficient @xmath0 of the gauss - bonnet invariant in the overall conformal anomaly of the theory .    in chs models",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 is much higher than the number of field polarizations @xmath1 which means that the energy scale of the model @xmath2 is essentially ( by three or four orders of magnitude for @xmath5-gravity and higgs inflation model ) below the gravitational cutoff @xmath3 , the latter being determined from the requirement of smallness of graviton loop corrections .",
    "this justifies a special approximation scheme in which these nonrenormalizable corrections are treated within the effective field theory below this cutoff , while the dominant quantum contribution of chs fields is treated beyond perturbation theory and dynamically puts the bound on the energy scale of the model .",
    "though it fits presently very popular ideas of string theory , higher spin gauge theory @xcite and holographic duality @xcite , this mechanism of a large @xmath0 is still vulnerable to criticism regarding the problem of perturbative unitarity for chs fields due to their higher - derivative nature .",
    "how important is the lack of unitarity in the hidden sector of our model ?",
    "free or weakly selfinteracting chs fields are coupled to the observable sector only gravitationally , but below the gravitational cutoff this coupling is apparently suppressed similarly to the contribution of graviton loops and the loops containing any single graviton propagator .",
    "this effective decoupling essentially reduces the effects of non - unitarity .",
    "of course , this is not a fundamental solution of the problem , which is expected to be achieved only at the nonperturbative level under a better understanding of the gauge theory of interacting higher spin fields .",
    "the problem of unitarity can manifest itself and even can be destructive for a negative @xmath0 , which is possible in the case of the dominant contribution of higher spin conformal fermions with @xmath54 .",
    "as we saw , cosmology with @xmath225 is inconsistent , because its statistical sum contains a divergent contribution of necklace instantons .",
    "the source of this inconsistency is apparently related to the breakdown of perturbative unitarity .",
    "suppression of vacuum necklace instantons , mentioned in sect.2 , is based on the gaussian integration with a positive definite quadratic form @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath247 , induced by the microcanonical density matrix as depicted in fig.2 , can be enforced with the lagrange multiplier @xmath248 in the path integral for a generic theory with the quadratic action @xmath249=\\frac12\\int dx\\,\\phi f\\phi$ ] .",
    "therefore , the modification due to this boundary condition reduces to a single gaussian integral over @xmath248 @xmath250      + i\\lambda\\big(\\phi(x_+)-\\phi(x_-)\\big)\\big)\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\qquad\\qquad=\\big({\\rm det } \\,f\\big)^{-1/2}\\int d\\lambda\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac12\\int dx\\,dy\\,j_\\lambda(x)g(x , y )      j_\\lambda(y)\\right )             \\label{1000 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the local source @xmath251 peaked at @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and the kernel @xmath254  the green s function of @xmath255 .",
    "therefore , the statistical sum reduces to zero , @xmath256 , in view of the divergent coincidence limits for @xmath254 , @xmath257 .",
    "violation of unitarity is associated with the indefiniteness of the operator @xmath255 which makes @xmath258 divergent , and this is consistent with the divergence to @xmath245 of the integral part of ( [ action - instanton ] ) for @xmath223 .",
    "the situation with the anomaly free theory of the infinite chain of chs fields is different .",
    "its statistical sum is finite , but it suffers from the infrared catastrophe at @xmath131 similar to the problem with the no - boundary prescription .",
    "therefore , it is hardly acceptable as a source of cosmological initial conditions , because it suggests that the origin of infinitely big universe is infinitely more probable than that of the finite one .",
    "this means that the anomaly free chs model , as a potential basis of a consistent theory  of everything \" , does not give any advantages in context of cosmological applications . what ruins these advantages is the oversubtraction of power divergences by @xmath227-regularization of the sum over spins in ( [ bosonf1 ] ) , which leads to a negative value of the thermal energy  the other side of breakdown of perturbative unitarity",
    "apparently , the disregard of power divergences in the sum over spins physically is not such a harmless procedure . their recovery in the regularization ( [ reg ] ) with",
    "the parameter @xmath238 , which is equivalent to the cutoff in the height of the spin tower at @xmath259 , brings us back to the predictions of the model with a finite tower of chs fields .",
    "this spin cutoff becomes a phenomenological parameter related to the inflation energy scale detectable via cmb observations .",
    "thus , the chs models dominated by fermions with @xmath223 and anomaly free models with @xmath240 remain a playground of holographic methods in ads / cft correspondence , but fail to generate interesting cft driven cosmology .",
    "this matches with the fact established in @xcite that the cft driven scenario implies another type of holographic duality  the dgp / cft correspondence . for positive @xmath260",
    "this is the duality between the 4-dimensional cft driven cosmology of @xcite and the tree - level dynamics of the 4d brane which is embedded into the 5-dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter bulk and carries the 4d einstein - hilbert term  the generalization of the dgp model @xcite .",

    "<S> these initial conditions are set by thermal garland type cosmological instantons in the sub - planckian energy range for the model of chs fields with a large positive coefficient @xmath0 of the gauss - bonnet term in their total conformal anomaly and a large number of their polarizations @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound of this range @xmath2 is shown to be much lower than the gravitational cutoff @xmath3 which is defined by the requirement of smallness of the perturbatively nonrenormalizable graviton loop contributions . in this way we justify the approximation scheme in which the nonrenormalizable graviton sector is subject to effective field theory under this cutoff , </S>",
    "<S> whereas the renormalizable sector of multiple chs fields is treated beyond perturbation theory and dynamically generates the bound on the inflation scale of the cft cosmology @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms recent predictions for the origin of the starobinsky @xmath5 and higgs inflation models from the chs cosmology , which occurs at the energy scale three or four orders of magnitude below the gravitational cutoff , @xmath6 . </S>",
