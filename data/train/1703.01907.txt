    "an elementary function is a function of one variable constructed using that variable and constants , and by performing a finite number of repeated algebraic operations involving exponentials and logarithms .",
    "an indefinite integral which can be expressed in terms of elementary functions is an elementary integral . if it can not be evaluated in terms of elementary functions , then it is non - elementary@xcite .",

    "it was shown in @xcite , using liouville 1938 s theorem , that @xmath17 is non - elementary . with similar arguments as in @xcite",
    ", one can show that @xmath18 is also non - elementary . using the euler identity @xmath19 , and noticing that if the integral of @xmath20 is elementary , then both its real and imaginary parts are elementary @xcite",
    ", one can readily prove that the integrals @xmath0 dx$ ] and @xmath2 , and @xmath1 dx$ ] , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are non - elementary by using the fact that their real and imaginary parts are non - elementary .",
    "the integrals @xmath7 dx$ ] and @xmath8 dx$ ] , where n is a positive integer , are also non - elementary since they can be expressed in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    to my knowledge",
    ", no one has evaluated these integrals before . to this end , in this paper , formulas for these non - elementary integrals are expressed in terms of the hypergeometric functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are entire functions on the whole complex space @xmath21 , and whose properties are well known @xcite . and therefore , their corresponding definite integrals can be evaluated using the fundamental theorem of calculus ( ftc ) .",
    "for example , the sine integral @xmath22 is evaluated for any @xmath23 and @xmath24 using the ftc .    on the other hand , the integrals @xmath12 and @xmath25 ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath11 .",
    "this is quite important since one may re - investigate the asymptotic behavior of the exponential ( @xmath26 ) and logarithmic ( @xmath27 ) integrals using the asymptotic expression of the hypergeometric function @xmath11 .",
    "other non - elementary integrals can be written in terms of @xmath28 or @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , as a result of substitution , the integral @xmath29 can be written in terms of @xmath30 and then evaluated , and using integration by parts , the integral @xmath31 can be written in terms of @xmath25 and then evaluated .    using the euler identity @xmath32 or the hyperbolic identity @xmath33 , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
