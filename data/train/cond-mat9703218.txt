    "low - dimensional magnetic systems have long attracted the attention of experimental and theoretical physics . in systems with reduced dimensionality",
    "the fluctuations are enhanced and can prevent a system from long - range ordering . for one- and two - dimensional isotropic heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnets with short - range interaction",
    "it has been proven exactly @xcite that long - range order is absent for finite temperatures .",
    "the existence of long - range order in low - dimensional systems depends crucially on anisotropies and long - range interactions , as there are single - ion anisotropy or the dipole - dipole interaction .    in real systems",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is always present in addition to the short - range exchange interaction .",
    "although the dipole - dipole energy is weak compared to the exchange energy it plays an important role in low - dimensional systems due to its anisotropic and long - range character .",
    "maleev @xcite showed that in a two - dimensional ferromagnetic system the additional dipolar interaction leads to a modification of the spin - wave frequency in the long wavelength limit from a quadratic to a square root wave vector dependence , for which long - range order is established .",
    "for the antiferromagnetic counterpart on a square and a honeycomb lattice it has also been shown @xcite that dipolar interaction stabilizes long - range magnetic order at finite temperatures . in this cases , however , the dipolar anisotropy leads to a discrete ground state with spins oriented perpendicular to the plane , producing an energy gap in the dispersion relation .",
    "the finite nel temperatures in various quasi two - dimensional systems ( e.g. k@xmath1mnf@xmath2 ) have been calculated within the dipolar model @xcite , in good agreement with the experimental values .    in recent papers",
    "@xcite we determined the magnetic phase diagram of the two - dimensional , dipolar heisenberg antiferromagnet ( square and honeycomb lattice ) for fields along the easy - axis , i.e. perpendicular to the plane .",
    "in contrast to models with single - ion anisotropy or an anisotropic exchange interaction , we found that the dipole - dipole interaction establishes a new phase , an intermediate phase . with increasing field strength the system changes by second - order transitions from the nel phase to an intermediate phase , a spin - flop phase and finally to a paramagnetic phase at high magnetic fields .",
    "from the results in two dimensions we anticipate that also in quasi one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets , the dipolar interaction will reduce thermal and quantum fluctuations and thus increase the tendency to order .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the influence of the dipolar interaction on the classical ground states and on quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is shown that due to the competition of the exchange and dipolar interaction we can distinguish two regions , namely an exchange dominated and a dipolar dominated region . in the former",
    "the dipolar energy leads to a planar anisotropy , whereas in the latter it leads to an easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "we study the dispersion relations for various relative strengths of the dipolar interaction . in the exchange dominated region ,",
    "the dipolar interaction breaks the continuous symmetry of the ground state partially and favors states with spins perpendicular to the chain direction .",
    "rotation symmetry around the chain direction still exists . the dispersion relation for this phase",
    "is modified by the dipolar interaction , but as in the isotropic counterpart no long - range order can exist even for @xmath3 .",
    "the most famous quasi one - dimensional systems are the ternary compounds abx@xmath4 ( a alkaline , b transition metal and x halogen ) , which have been studied intensively experimentally in the context of haldane s phase @xcite and solitonic excitations @xcite . of particular interest are the mn compounds .",
    "because the angular momentum @xmath5 is zero , no crystal field splitting occurs in these systems and the dipole - dipole interaction should be the most important anisotropy .",
    "experiments @xcite show an anisotropy in the magnetization measurements for fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the spin - chain axis .",
    "we will show that this anisotropy can be understood qualitatively by our simple one - dimensional dipolar model .",
    "up to now , only partial aspects of the dipole - dipole interaction have been considered @xcite . in ref[9 ] the classical ground state has been determined , but no excitations have been investigated , whereas in ref[10 ] the dipolar interaction is only considered for nearest neighbors . in this paper the effects of the additional dipolar interaction will be studied in a systematic way .    in this spin wave theory we disregard kink - like excitations , which even for the @xmath6 decay of the dipolar interaction destroy one - dimensional long - range order . however , for wavelengths shorter than the correlation length magnon excitations become important .",

    "the short range antiferromagnetic order supports spin waves with wave vectors not too close to the center of the brillouin zone . especially for",
    "quasi one - dimensional systems the weak interchain interaction leads to a stabilization of the magnetic order and spin waves become the relevant excitations .",

    "<S> we report on the properties of a dipolar , antiferromagnetic chain in the framework of linear spin - wave theory . as a model we use an isotropic heisenberg - hamiltonian with antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor exchange and anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram is calculated for an arbitrary ratio of dipolar interaction to exchange interaction and for fields both parallel and perpendicular to the chain direction . </S>",
    "<S> we can distinguish two regions , an antiferromagnetic exchange dominated region , in which the dipole energy acts as a planar anisotropy and a ferromagnetic dipole dominated region , in which the dipole energy acts as an easy - axis anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy in the field dependent magnetization , which is caused by quantum fluctuations , is several orders of magnitude larger than the anisotropy predicted by the classical theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dipole - dipole interaction does not lead to long - range order in the pure one - dimensional case , however for quasi one - dimensional systems spin - waves are important . </S>",
