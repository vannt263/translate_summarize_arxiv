    "while massive black holes ( bhs ; here defined as @xmath7  @xmath3 ) are ubiquitous in the centers of galaxies of milky way mass and larger @xcite , little is known about the occurrence rate and properties of bhs in dwarf galaxies ( i.e. , galaxies with @xmath8  @xmath3 ) . studying",
    "the population of bhs in dwarf galaxies is useful for understanding bh formation and growth in the early universe .",
    "having had relatively quiet merger histories , their bhs may have masses similar to their  birth \" mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clues to the formation of bh seeds may reside in the well studied relation between bh mass and stellar velocity dispersion ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . using semi - analytic modeling , @xcite find that , while the relationship between bh mass and velocity dispersion ( or the @xmath9 relation ) is in place by @xmath10 for massive halos , systems with lower mass bhs ( @xmath11 ) evolve onto it at later times .",
    "if bh seeds form  light \" ( @xmath12 ; the remnants of population iii stars , see e.g. , @xcite ) , then bhs begin as undermassive with respect to the local @xmath6 relation , and will evolve towards it from below . alternatively , if bh seeds form  heavy \" ( @xmath13 ; through direct collapse of gas clouds , e.g. , @xcite ) , then bhs are initially overmassive and systems evolve rightwards onto the relation ( i.e. , towards higher velocity dispersions ) as the host galaxies grow through mergers . the smallest @xmath14 halos ( @xmath15 ) have not yet undergone major mergers , and thus may be present - day outliers on the local @xmath6 relation .",
    "finding and weighing relatively low - mass bhs is difficult due to the small gravitational sphere of influence of the bh , which is typically @xmath16 parsec for @xmath17  @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in order to identify bhs in dwarf galaxies outside the local group , it is necessary to look for signs of bh activity ( i.e. , active galactic nuclei , or agn ) .",
    "large - scale surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have made it possible to search for signatures of agn in samples comprised of tens of thousands of galaxies .",
    "early work by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , identified galaxies in the sdss with low - mass agn by searching for broad h@xmath0 emission , which can be produced by virialized gas near the central bh .",
    "these studies identified @xmath18 low - mass agn candidates with a median bh mass of @xmath19  @xmath3 .",
    "more recent studies have pushed the search for low - mass agn into the dwarf galaxy regime .",
    "x - ray and radio observations led to the discovery of agn in the dwarf starburst galaxy henize 2 - 10 @xcite , and in the dwarf galaxy pair mrk 709 @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations revealed the well - studied agn in ngc 4395 @xcite and pox 52 @xcite , and more recently led to the discovery of a bh with a mass in the range of @xmath20  @xmath3  in the dwarf galaxy rgg 118 @xcite .",
    "additionally , multiwavelength studies using large samples of _ bona fide _ dwarf galaxies have produced a collective sample of hundreds of agn candidates in dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter r13 ) searched for dwarf galaxies with spectroscopic signatures of agn activity based on their narrow and/or broad emission lines . out of @xmath21 nearby ( @xmath22 ; d @xmath23 mpc ) dwarf galaxies in the sdss , they identified 136 galaxies with narrow - line ratios indicating photoionization at least partly due to an agn based on the bpt ( baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ) diagram , i.e. , they were classified as either agn or agn / star - forming composites ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a fraction of these also had broad h@xmath0 emission .",
    "additionally , r13 identified 15 galaxies with broad h@xmath0 emission in their sdss spectroscopy ( fwhm ranging from @xmath24 ) , but with narrow - line ratios that placed them in the star forming region of the bpt diagram .",
    "we are particularly concerned with the origin of the broad emission in these systems .",
    "broad balmer emission with fwhm up to several thousand kilometers per second can be produced by stellar processes such as type ii supernovae , luminous blue variables @xcite , or wolf - rayet stars .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy , taken over a sufficiently long baseline , can help distinguish between an agn and one of the aforementioned transient stellar phenomena .    here , we present follow - up optical spectroscopic observations of 14 of the 15 bpt star forming galaxies with broad h@xmath0 presented in r13 , as well as observations of ten bpt agn ( one with broad h@xmath0 ) and three bpt composites ( one with broad h@xmath0 ) .",
    "follow - up observations for rgg 118  the current record holder for the lowest - mass bh in a galaxy nucleus  were presented separately in @xcite .",
    "the goals of this work are two - fold .",
    "first , for our targets which were identified by r13 to have broad h@xmath0 emission ( broader than narrow lines such as [ sii]@xmath256713,6731 ) with fwhm @xmath26 , we analyze their spectra and determine whether the broad h@xmath0 emission is still present and consistent with previous observations .",
    "second , for galaxies with sufficiently high - resolution follow - up spectroscopy , we measure stellar velocity dispersions .    in section 2 ,",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction procedures . in section 3",
    ", we discuss our emission line fitting analysis and report stellar velocity dispersion measurements for objects with sufficiently high spectral resolution data . in section 4 , we present results from the follow - up spectroscopy for the broad line objects .",
