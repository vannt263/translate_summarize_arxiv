    "besides the regular input parameters such as the quark masses and well measured decay constants of various mesons , there is only one free parameter to be determined , that is @xmath117 in the light front wavefunction . in our earlier work @xcite , by fitting the data of the semi - leptonic decays @xmath213 , we obtained the values of @xmath214}$ ] .",
    "similarly , we fix the values @xmath206}$ ] for proton and @xmath205}$ ] for @xmath2 .",
    "our numerical results are shown in corresponding tables and some measurable quantities such as the up - down asymmetries are also evaluated",
    ". a clear comparison of our prediction on the decay rate of @xmath215 with the results predicted by other models and as well as the experimental data is also explicitly presented .",
    "one can notice that our result for @xmath3 is @xmath216 which is in good agreement with the data .",
    "the success is not too surprising even though the model we adopt is much simplified .",
    "definitely this value obtained in this work is closer to the cental value of measurement than the previous evaluations , but since there is a large uncertainty in the data , one still can not justify which model is more preferable than others because within two standard deviations , all the numerical results achieved with all the approaches listed in the table are consistent with data . the asymmetry parameter which may be important for determining the applicability of the adopted model ,",
    "is estimated as @xmath217 , which is generally consistent with that obtained in other models and approaches .",
    "of course the details , especially the branching ratios will be further tested by the more accurate experiments in the future .",
    "besides the semi - leptonic decays , we also estimate the branching ratios of several non - leptonic decay modes which are listed in table viii .",
    "recently the cdf collaboration@xcite has measured the branching ratios of @xmath218 and @xmath219 as @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "our prediction on @xmath222=(@xmath223 ) is consistent with the measurement of the cdf within one standard deviation , but for @xmath224 our value is @xmath225 , one order smaller than the data of the cdf collaboration . following the literature , in our calculation , we employ the factorization scheme where the emitted pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath175 or k ) is factorized out and described by the common - accepted form factor @xmath226 where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are the corresponding axial current , decay constant of meson m and its four - momentum respectively .",
    "it is noticed that in the case @xmath218 , at the vertex @xmath229 the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa entry is approximately @xmath230 whereas for the case @xmath219 , the ckm entry is @xmath231 , thus comparing with @xmath218 , the amplitude of the process @xmath232 is suppressed by a factor @xmath233 .",
    "thus besides a small difference between the final phase spaces of the two reactions , one can roughly estimate that @xmath234 , and this estimate is consistent with our numerical results .",
    "therefore the smallness of @xmath224 seems reasonable .",
    "however the data of cdf show completely different results that @xmath235 is anomalously larger than @xmath236 .",
    "in fact , in our calculations on the non - leptonic decays , we only consider the contributions from the tree diagrams and neglect the penguin - loop effects .",
    "for the mode of @xmath218 , the penguin contribution can be safely neglected compared to the tree level . however , for the mode of @xmath219 , the tree level contribution is suppressed by the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa entry @xmath237 while for the penguin diagram , the main contribution comes from the loop where top quark is the intermediate fermion . in the case",
    ", the ckm entry would be @xmath238 which is almost two orders larger than @xmath237 .",
    "thus even though there is a loop suppression of order @xmath239 , it is compensated by the much larger ckm entry .",
    "this situation was discussed in @xcite where the authors used the pqcd method to carry out the calculations .",
    "in fact , we make a rough estimation of the contribution from the top - penguin , and the result is almost five times larger than the contribution from the tree diagram given above",
    ".    however , from another aspect , when the penguin diagram is taken into account , the factorization is dubious .",
    "that is why we do not include the loop contributions in this present work , but will make a detailed discussion in our coming paper .    actually , even including the penguin contribution , the theoretically estimated branching ratio of @xmath224 is still below the data and obviously smaller than that of @xmath236 .",
    "if this measurement is valid and approved by further experiments , it would be a new anomaly which may hint an unknown mechanism which dominates the transition or new physics beyond the standard model and @xmath235 . ] and it is also consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "the good agreement of our results on the semileptonic decays of @xmath0 to light baryon and several non - leptonic decay modes with data indicates the following points .",
    "first , the diqaurk picture : as we know , two quarks in a color - anti - triplet attract each other and constitute a cooper - pair - like subject of spin 0 or 1 . however , until now , many theorists still doubt the justifiability of the diquark picture .",
    "it is true that even though the diquark structure was raised almost as early as the birth of the quark model , its validity or reasonability of application is still in sharp dispute .",
    "in fact , it should be rigorously testified by experiments .",
    "we have argued that for some processes , the diquark picture may be more applicable than in the others .",
    "actually , in our case , we can convince ourselves that the picture should apply . as aforementioned , diquark is only a spectator in the transitions which we concern in this work , therefore its inner structure may not affect the numerical results much .",
    "secondly , the produced baryon is very relativistic , i.e. very close to the light - cone , generally the details of the inner structure of the spectator diquark may not be important , this interpretation is somehow similar to the parton picture which was conceived out by feynman and bjorken long time ago .",
    "namely at very high energy collisions , the interaction among partons can be ignored at the leading order , thus in our case the interaction between the quark which undergoes a transition , and the spectator diquark should be weak and negligible .",
    "third is that the small effects caused by the inner structure of the diquark may be partly included in the parameter @xmath117 of the light - front wavefuction .",
    "the agreement with data indicates that the diquark picture and the light - front quark model indeed apply in the analysis of the heavy baryon transiting into a light one .",
    "moreover , since we employ the factorization scheme to deal with the non - leptonic decays , we find that to some modes , it works well , but to some modes where loop contributions may dominate or just are comparable to the tree contributions , the scenario encounters serious challenges@xcite",
    ".    we further investigate the measurable polarization asymmetries . because the information on the polarization asymmetries may be more sensitive to the model adopted in the theoretical calculations than the decay width , accurate measurements",
    "would discriminate various models and indicate how to improve the details of the models .",
    "moreover , we also predict the rates and asymmetries of several similar modes of @xmath0 non - leptonic decays in the same model , and the results are listed in table iiiv of last section .",
    "the numbers will be tested in the future .",
    "fortunately , the high luminosity at lhcb can provide large database on @xmath0 and moreover , with great improvements of experimental facility and detection technique , we expect that more and more accurate measurements will be carried out in the near future and theorists will be able to further testify , improve , or even negate our present models .",
    "indeed , the baryons are much more complicated than mesons , but careful studies on the processes where baryons are involved would be very beneficial for getting better insight into the hadron structure and underlying principles , especially the non - perturbative qcd effects including the factorization and plausibility of the diquark picture",
    ". the lhcb will be an ideal place to do the job .",
