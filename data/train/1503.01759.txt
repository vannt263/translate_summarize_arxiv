    "ideal crystals are absent in nature , and most of their physical properties , such as plasticity , melting , growth , etc . , are defined by defects of the crystalline structure .",
    "therefore , a study of defects is a topical scientific question of importance for applications in the first place . at present",
    ", a fundamental theory of defects is absent in spite of the existence of dozens of monographs and thousands of articles .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to the theory of defects is based on riemann  cartan geometry , which involves nontrivial metric and torsion . in this approach ,",
    "a crystal is considered as a continuous elastic medium with a spin structure .",
    "if the displacement vector field is a smooth function , then there are only elastic stresses corresponding to diffeomorphisms of the euclidean space .",
    "if the displacement vector field has discontinuities , then we are saying that there are defects in the elastic structure .",
    "defects in the elastic structure are called dislocations and lead to the appearance of nontrivial geometry . precisely , they correspond to a nonzero torsion tensor , equal to the surface density of the burgers vector .",
    "defects in the spin structure are called disclinations .",
    "they correspond to nonzero curvature tensor , curvature tensor being the surface density of the frank vector .",
    "the idea to relate torsion to dislocations appeared in the 1950s [ 14 ] .",
    "this approach is still being successfully developed ( note reviews [ 511 ] ) , and is often called the gauge theory of dislocations .",
    "some time ago we proposed the geometrical theory of defects [ 1214 ] .",
    "our approach is essentially different from others in two respects .",
    "firstly , we do not have the displacement and rotational angle vector fields as independent variables because , in general , they are not continuous . instead , the triad field and @xmath0-connection are considered as independent variables .",
    "if defects are absent , then the triad and @xmath0-connection reduce to partial derivatives of the displacement and rotational angle vector fields . in this case the latter can be reconstructed .",
    "secondly , the set of equilibrium equations is different .",
    "we proposed purely geometric set which coincides with that of euclidean three dimensional gravity with torsion .",
    "the nonlinear elasticity equations and principal chiral @xmath0 model for the spin structure enter the model through the elastic and lorentz gauge conditions [ 1416 ] which allow to reconstruct the displacement and rotational angle vector fields in the absence of dislocations in full agreement with classical models .",
    "the advantage of the geometric theory of defects is that it allows one to describe single defects as well as their continuous distributions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider propagation of torsional elastic waves in double wall tube with cylindrical dislocation .",
    "this defect was first described in @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the double wall tube was solved in @xcite and applied to double wall nanotubes .",
    "a similar problem was also solved for the cylindrical waveguide with wedge dislocation @xcite .",
    "let us describe double wall tube with cylindrical dislocation in the framework of the geometric theory of defects .",
    "we consider cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath2 in tree dimensional euclidean space @xmath3 .",
    "let there be two thick tubes @xmath4 and @xmath5 of elastic media , each axis coinciding with the @xmath6 axis .",
    "we suppose that @xmath7 ( see fig.[ftubed],_a _ , where a section @xmath8 is shown ) .",
    "section @xmath8 of double wall tube before ( _ a _ ) and after ( _ b _ ) defect creation.,title=\"fig : \" ]   section @xmath8 of double wall tube before ( _ a _ ) and after ( _ b _ ) defect creation.,title=\"fig : \" ]    now we make one tube with the inside cylindrical dislocation in the following manner .",
    "we stretch symmetrically the inner tube and compress the outer one . then glue together the external surface of the inner tube with the internal surface of the outer tube .",
    "afterwards the media comes to some equilibrium state . due to rotational and translational symmetry",
    "we obtain one tube @xmath9 with the axis which coincides with the @xmath6 axis ( see fig.[ftubed],_b _ ) .",
    "radii of cylinders constituting tube surfaces are mapped as follows @xmath10 the gluing is performed along the cylinder @xmath11 , and there is cylindrical defect ( dislocation ) because part of the media between tubes is removed .",
    "the obtained double wall tube with cylindrical dislocation is rotationally and translationally symmetric .",
    "the constructed model of the tube with cylindrical dislocation can be considered as continuous model of double wall nanotube ( for a general review , see @xcite ) .",
    "consider double wall nanotube having two atomic layers .",
    "suppose the inner layer has 18 and outer layer has 20 atoms which are shown in fig.[ftubed],_b _ by points .",
    "natural length measure here is the interatomic distance .",
    "then the length of a circle has a jump when one goes from inner to outer layer . in the geometric theory of defects , it means that the metric component @xmath12 is not continuous in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the corresponding model will be described below .",
    "to find radii @xmath13 , @xmath11 , and @xmath14 we have to solve the classical elasticity problem .",
    "let us define the displacement vector field by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coordinates of a point before and after deformation respectively .",
    "we consider the displacement field as a vector function on points of media after deformation and gluing .",
    "this is more adequate because the resulting media after gluing is a connected manifold ( before the gluing procedure , each tube represents a connected component ) . in equilibrium state ,",
    "the vector displacement field satisfies equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the poisson ratio and @xmath22 is the laplacian . for convenience , we consider components of the displacement vector field with respect to the orthonormal basis @xmath23 where @xmath24 we denote indices with respect to the orthonormal basis by hat : @xmath25 the latin indices referred to an orthonormal basis are rased and lowered by kronecker symbol : @xmath26 .",
    "the divergence and laplacian have the following form in cylindrical coordinates @xmath27    from the symmetry of the problem , we deduce that only radial component of the displacement field differs from zero , and it does not depend on the angle @xmath28 and @xmath6 coordinates : @xmath29 equation ( [ qbhfyk ] ) for zero @xmath30 and @xmath31 components are automatically satisfied .",
    "it is easy to check that the radial derivative of the divergence , @xmath32 coincides with the laplacian @xmath33 therefore the radial component of eq.([qbhfyk ] ) takes the form @xmath34 a general solution of this equation depends on two integration constants : @xmath35    note that the equilibrium equation ( [ qbncgd ] ) does not depend on the poisson ratio @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the cylindrical dislocation is the geometrical defect .",
    "boundary conditions have to be imposed to fix the integration constants .",
    "let us introduce notation for inner and outer tubes : @xmath36 now boundary conditions are to be imposed .",
    "we assume that the surface of two wall nanotube is free , i.e.  the deformation tensor is zero on the boundary : @xmath37 we assume also that the media is in equilibrium .",
    "it means that elastic forces on the gluing surface must be equal to zero : @xmath38    each of boundary conditions ( [ qnbdtg ] ) defines one integration constant for internal and external solutions : @xmath39 signs of the integration constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 are chosen in such a way that displacement vector is positive and negative for inner and outer tubes respectively .",
    "this in agreement with the imposed problem .    substitution of obtained solutions ( [ qbndtr ] ) into the gluing condition ( [ qbdjii ] ) defines the ratio of integration constants : @xmath42    the entirety condition for the media is @xmath43 these equations allow to find the distance between initial tubes which characterize the cylindrical dislocation : @xmath44 where expression for @xmath41 ( [ qbkkos ] ) is used .",
    "afterwards we find the integration constants : @xmath45    thus we find the displacement vector field @xmath46 for double wall tube where constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by eqs.([qnhydh ] ) .",
    "qualitative behaviour of this vector field is shown in fig.[ftubeu],_a_. differentiation of this vector field in domains @xmath47 , @xmath48 and its extension to the point @xmath11 by continuity yields the function @xmath49 which is depicted in fig.[ftubeu],_b_.     qualitative behaviour of the radial component of the displacement vector field for the double wall tube ( _ a _ ) .",
    "the derivative of the displacement vector field ( _ b_).,title=\"fig : \" ]   qualitative behaviour of the radial component of the displacement vector field for the double wall tube ( _ a _ ) .",
    "the derivative of the displacement vector field ( _ b_).,title=\"fig : \" ]    note that media entirety condition ( [ qfaelk ] ) leads to the jump of the displacement vector field at the point @xmath11 : @xmath50 since vector field @xmath51 has discontinuity at the point @xmath11 , the formal derivative of @xmath51 contains @xmath52 .",
    "this @xmath53-function is thrown away in the geometric theory of defects @xcite .",
    "double wall tube with cylindrical dislocation is parameterized by four constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath13 , @xmath11 , @xmath14 , @xmath58 .",
    "formulae ( [ qnhydh ] ) define constants @xmath40 , @xmath41 and , consequently , the displacement vector field through the second set of parameters .",
    "it follows from definition ( [ qcasew ] ) that there is one - to - one correspondence between two sets of parameters .",
    "now we calculate the metric induced in double wall tube . by definition",
    ", it has the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the euclidean metric in cylindrical coordinates . the relation between coordinates before and after defect creation",
    "is given by equality ( [ qcasew ] ) .",
    "using explicit form of displacement vector field ( [ qbvxgt ] ) we find the induced metric in the double wall tube @xmath61 the component @xmath62 of this metric is continuous function but its derivative has a jump at @xmath11 .",
    "the component @xmath63 is discontinuous at the point @xmath64 .",
    "the volum element for metric ( [ qbcnct ] ) is @xmath65 the right hand side of this relation is positive because both multipliers are positive .",
    "the second multiplier @xmath66 is positive by construction .",
    "the first multiplier is also positive .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath67 has the maximum at @xmath64 . at this point",
    ", the following inequality holds @xmath68 where expression ( [ qfaelk ] ) for @xmath40 is used .",
    "the circumference is a geometric invariant .",
    "it is equal to @xmath69 for metric ( [ qbnctf ] ) .",
    "when we go from the inner tube to the outer one it has the jump @xmath70 where @xmath58 is the distance between tubes before the dislocation is made .",
    "this observation agrees with the continuous model of double wall tube .",
    "here we consider torsional waves in the double wall tube with cylindrical dislocation described in the previous section .",
    "we denote the displacement vector field by the new letter @xmath71 because the letter @xmath51 was used in the previous section for the displacements corresponding to the defect creation .",
    "the total displacement vector field is equal to the sum @xmath72 where @xmath51 corresponds to the defect creation and @xmath71 describes oscillations in the double wall tube with cylindrical dislocation . by definition ,",
    "the displacement vector field @xmath71 satisfies the wave equation @xmath73 where the covariant derivative @xmath74 and laplace  beltrami operator @xmath75 are defined by metric ( [ qbcnct ] ) of double wall tube .",
    "this equation is covariant with respect to changing of coordinate systems .",
    "it can be solved in cylindrical coordinates @xmath76 after the defect creation with metric ( [ qbcnct ] ) .",
    "however it is easier to follow another way .",
    "we solve the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the old radial coordinate before the defect creation @xmath79 and afterwards impose necessary boundary conditions .",
    "it is easier because the metric is euclidean in the initial coordinate system .",
    "let us consider torsional waves",
    ". in this case only angular component of the displacement vector field differs from zero : @xmath80 from symmetry consideration , the angular component @xmath81 does not depend on @xmath28 and @xmath6 . for this vector field",
    "the @xmath82 and @xmath83 components of eq.([qnbhfy ] ) are automatically satisfied .",
    "it follows that the dilation for torsional waves is equal to zero @xmath84 and consequently torsional waves take place without media compression .",
    "we look for solution of eq.([qnbhfy ] ) in the plain wave form @xmath85,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the amplitude , @xmath87 is the wave vector , and @xmath88 is the frequency of the wave .",
    "then wave equation ( [ qnbhfy ] ) in cylindrical coordinates reduces to the bessel equation @xmath89 where @xmath90 a general solution of this equation depends on two integration constants .",
    "therefore general solutions for inner and outer tubes are @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the bessel function of the first kind and first order , @xmath93 is the neumann function of the first order ( see , i.e.  @xcite ) , and @xmath94 are integration constants .    to find the integration constants we impose boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary surfaces are assumed to be free , i.e.  the deformation tensor on the boundary must be zero @xmath95 because @xmath96 and @xmath97 , these equalities in the initial coordinates take the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 and prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument @xmath6 .",
    "these equalities define two integration constants : @xmath100    on the gluing surface , we impose two conditions : entirety and equality of stresses , @xmath101 as a result we get two equations @xmath102-c_3\\big[j_1(z_2)-k_3n_1(z_2)\\big]=0 , \\\\    c_1\\big[j'_1(z_1)-k_0n'_1(z_1)\\big]-c_3\\big[j'_1(z_2)-k_3n'_1(z_2)\\big]=0 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the necessary and sufficient condition for this system to have a nontrivial solution is the equality of its determinant to zero : @xmath103\\big[j'_1(z_2)-k_3n'_1(z_2)\\big]- \\\\    -\\big[j_1(z_2)-k_3n_1(z_2)\\big]\\big[j'_1(z_1)-k_0n'_1(z_1)\\big]=0.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for given parameters of the double wall tube @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56  @xmath57 , the obtained relation is the equation for the constant @xmath104 . let @xmath104 be a root of eq .",
    "( [ qbsioo ] ) , then the equality @xmath105 defines the dispersion relation .",
