    "we expect the universe to be homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales .",
    "indeed , one of the fundamental postulates in cosmology is that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "it is this postulate , generally known as the cosmological principle ( cp)@xcite , that allows us to approximate the description of space - time by a friedman - robertson - walker - lemaitre ( flrw ) metric .",
    "the standard approach to cosmology assumes that the universe can be modelled as a perturbed flrw universe .",
    "the large scale structures ( lss ) in the universe are believed to have been formed due to the collapse of small inhomogeneities present in the early universe @xcite .",
    "thus it is of paramount importance to test whether the observed distribution of galaxies approaches a homogeneous distribution at large scales .",
    "the primary aim of galaxy surveys @xcite is to determine the distribution of matter in our universe .",
    "redshift surveys of galaxies have revealed that the universe consists of a hierarchy of structures starting from groups and clusters of galaxies to super clusters and interconnected network of filaments spread across the observed universe @xcite .",
    "fractal dimensions can be used as an indicator to test whether or not the distribution of galaxies approaches homogeneity .",
    "one of the reasons that make the fractal dimensions an attractive option is that one does not require the assumption of an average density @xcite .",
    "ideally one would like to work with volume limited samples in order to avoid corrections due to a varying selection function .",
    "redshift surveys of galaxies can be used to construct such sub - samples from the full magnitude limited sample but this typically leads to a sub - sample that has a much smaller number of galaxies as compared to the full sample .",
    "this limitation was found to be too restrictive for the earliest surveys and corrections for the varying selection function were attempted in order to determine the scale of homogeneity : for example see . with the large surveys available today , this limitation is no longer very serious .",
    "fractal dimensions are computed for the given sample or sub - sample and the scale beyond which the fractal dimension is close to the physical dimension of the sample is identified as the scale of homogeneity . we expect that at scales larger than the scale of homogeneity , any fluctuation in density are small enough to be ignored . thus at larger scales , cp can be assumed to be valid and it is at these scales that the flrw metric is a correct description of the universe .",
    "fractal dimension is defined in the mathematically rigorous way only for an infinite set of points .",
    "given that the observational samples are finite , there is a need to understand the relation between the fractal dimension and the physical dimension for such samples . in this paper , we compute the expected fractal dimension for a finite distribution of points ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the early work on these effects has focused on small scales where the amplitude of clustering is large . in this work ,",
    "we calculate fractal distribution for a uniform distribution , as well as for a weakly clustered distribution of a finite number of points .",
    "this is of interest at larger scale where fractal dimensions are used as a tool to find the scale of homogeneity .",
    "catalogues of different extra - galactic objects have been studied using various statistical methods .",
    "one of the important tools in this direction has been the use of two point correlation function @xmath5 @xcite and its fourier transform the power spectrum @xmath6 .",
    "we have precise estimates of @xmath5 and the power spectrum @xmath6 @xcite from different galaxy surveys .",
    "different measurements appear to be consistent with one another once differences in selection function are accounted for @xcite ( but also see @xcite ) . on small scales the two point correlation function is found to be well described by the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xmath10mpc for the sdss ( @xcite ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xmath10mpc for the 2dfgrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent galaxy surveys have reassured us that the power law behaviour for @xmath5 does not extend to arbitrary large scales .",
    "the breakdown of this behaviour occurs at @xmath13 for sdss and at @xmath14 for 2dfgrs , which is consistent with the distribution of galaxies being homogeneous at large scales .",
    "a note of caution here is that though the @xmath5 determined from redshift surveys is consistent with the universe being homogeneous at large scales in that @xmath15 at large @xmath16 , it does not actually imply that the universe is homogeneous .",
    "this is because the two point correlation given by , @xmath17 where @xmath18 presupposes that galaxy distribution that we are analysing is homogeneous on the large scales of our survey .",
    "this is implicit in the fact that @xmath19 , which is assumed to be the spatial average density of matter in the universe , is computed by averaging the density from within the survey volume .",
    "of course , it may be possible to demonstrate that the survey is a fair sample of the universe by showing that the values of @xmath19 derived from sub - samples of the survey are consistent with each other , or that the value of @xmath19 computed at different scales converges to a definite value at scales much smaller than the size of the survey . to verify and hence validate the cosmological principle , it is useful to consider a statistical test which does not presuppose the premise being tested . in this paper",
    "we consider one such test , the `` multi - fractal analysis '' and apply it to distribution of particles in random as well as clustered distributions .",
    "fractal dimension , which is generally a fractional number , is characterised by the scaling exponent . in most physical situations ,",
    "we need to use a set with an invariant measure characterised by a whole spectrum of scaling exponents , instead of a single number .",
    "such a system is called a multi - fractal and we need to do a multi fractal analysis of a point set to study the system .",
    "various groups have used the concept of fractals to analyse catalogues of extra - galactic objects .",
    "see @xcite for an excellent review of quantitative measures used for describing distributions of points .",
    "based on the scale invariance of galaxy clustering , @xcite suggested that the distribution of galaxies is a fractal to arbitrarily large scales . in a later analysis of different samples of galaxies @xcite obtained results consistent with this argument .",
    "on the other hand @xcite showed that the distribution is a fractal only on small scales and on large scales there is a transition to homogeneity . if the distribution of galaxies is found to be a fractal then the average number of galaxies in a volume of radius @xmath16 centred on a galaxy should scale as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fractal dimension .",
    "hence the number density of neighbouring galaxies would go as @xmath22 in a @xmath1 dimensional distribution .",
    "this , when calculated for higher values of @xmath16 will show a decrease from that of lower scales . this effect led @xcite to believe that the value of correlation length @xmath23 ( eq.[eq:1 ] ) increases with the increase in size of the sample . however this interpretation is not supported by volume limited samples of various galaxy redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have shown the distribution of galaxies to be a mono - fractal up to the largest scales that they were able to analyse .",
    "on the other hand homogeneity has been seen at large scale in other analyses .",
    "the best argument in favour of large scale homogeneity stems from the near isotropy of radio sources or background radiation in projection on the sky @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the fractal dimension for a distribution of finite number of points which are distributed homogeneously as well as for those which are weakly clustered . for this purpose",
    "we use the multi - fractal analysis to study the scaling behaviour of uniform as well as weakly clustered distributions in turn finding the relationship between the fractal dimension and the two point correlation function .",
    "we find deviations of fractal dimension @xmath24 from the @xmath1 arising due to a finite number of points for a random distribution with uniform density , these deviations arise due to discreteness . in this case",
    "we can relate the deviation ( of @xmath24 from @xmath1 ) to the number density of points .",
    "we further show that for a distribution of points with weak clustering , there is an additional deviation of @xmath24 from @xmath1 .",
    "this deviation can be related to the two point correlation and the intuitive relation between the amplitude of clustering and deviation from homogeneity is given a quantitative expression .",
    "we then apply the derived relation to cosmology and compute the expected deviations in a model that fits most observations .",
    "a brief outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the method of analysis ,  3 contains results and discussion with the conclusions in  4 .",
    "fractal dimension is the basic characterisation of any point distribution .",
    "there are many different methods that can be used to calculate the fractal dimension .",
    "box counting dimension of fractal distribution is defined in terms of non empty boxes @xmath25 of radius @xmath16 required to cover the distribution . if @xmath26 we define @xmath27 to be the box counting dimension .",
    "one of the difficulties with such an analysis is that it does not depend on the number of particles inside the boxes and rather depends only on the number of boxes . as such it provides limited information about the degree of clumpiness of the distribution and",
    "is a purely geometrical measure . to get more detailed information on clustering of the distribution we use the concept of correlation dimension . instead of using the formal definition of correlation dimension , which demands that the number of points in the distribution approach infinity , we choose a working definition which can be applied to a distribution of a finite number of points .",
    "calculation of the correlation dimension requires the introduction of correlation integral given by @xmath28 here we assume that we have @xmath29 points in the distribution and we have @xmath30 cells centred on a fraction of these points .",
    "in general the number of points and cells are different as one can not use points near the edge of the sample where a sphere of radius @xmath16 is not completely inside the sample .",
    "@xmath31 denotes the number of particles within a distance @xmath16 from a particle at the point @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the heaviside function .    for the purpose of the analysis in this paper",
    ", it will be useful to define @xmath35 in terms of the probability of finding particles in a sphere of radius @xmath16 .",
    "we define correlation integral @xmath35 as , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the normalised probability of getting @xmath38 out of @xmath29 points as neighbours inside a radius @xmath16 of any of the points . for a homogeneous distribution of points , the probability for any point to fall within",
    "the neighbourhood is proportional to the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the total volume of the sample .",
    "in such a case @xmath35 reduces to the product of the volume of a sphere of radius @xmath16 and the total number of particles , divided by the total volume . as the total number and total volume are fixed quantities , @xmath35 for a homogeneous distribution of points scales as @xmath39 at sufficiently large scales .",
    "the power law scaling of correlation integral i.e. @xmath40 defines the correlation dimension @xmath41 of the distribution . @xmath42",
    "depending on the scaling of @xmath35 , the value of correlation dimension @xmath41 can vary with scale @xmath16 .",
    "for the special case of a homogeneous distribution , we see that @xmath43 at sufficiently large scales and this matches the intuitive expectation that the correlation dimension of a homogeneous distribution of points should equal the mathematically defined fractal dimension for infinite number of points .",
    "we see that the correlation integral is defined in terms of probability of finding @xmath38 point out of a distribution of @xmath29 points within a distance @xmath16 .",
    "this makes it a measure of one of the moments of the distribution .",
    "we need all the moments of the distribution to completely characterise the system statistically .",
    "the multi fractal analysis used here does this with the generalised dimension @xmath24 , the minkowski - bouligand dimension , which is defined for an arbitrary @xmath44 and typically computed for a range of values .",
    "it is different from renyi dimension only in the aspect that in this case the spheres of radius @xmath16 have been centred at the point belonging to the fractal whereas in renyi dimension the sphere need not be centred on the particle in the distribution ( see section on generalised dimensions in @xcite for a discussion of the two types of generalised dimensions . ) .",
    "the definition of generalised dimension @xmath24 is a generalisation of the correlation dimension @xmath41 .",
    "the correlation integral can be generalised to define @xmath45 as @xmath46 which is used to define the minkowski - bouligand dimension @xmath47 the generalised dimension corresponds to the correlation dimension for @xmath48 .",
    "the values of @xmath49 and @xmath24 can be related to a combination of correlation functions for @xmath50 , with contribution from the two - point to the @xmath44-point correlation functions for @xmath49 . a multi fractal structure , unlike a mono fractal",
    "can only be described by the full spectrum of @xmath24 .",
    "if the fractal in question is a mono - fractal then we have @xmath51 for all @xmath44 and at all scales .    by construction",
    ", the positive values of @xmath44 give more weightage to regions with a high number density whereas the negative values of @xmath44 give more weightage to under dense regions .",
    "thus we may interpret @xmath24 for @xmath52 as characterising the scaling behaviour of the galaxy distribution in the high density regions like clusters whereas @xmath53 characterises the scaling in voids .",
    "in the situation where the galaxy distribution is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , we intuitively expect @xmath54 independent of the value of @xmath44 at the relevant scales .      in our analysis",
    ", we first compute the expected values for @xmath49 and @xmath24 for a homogeneous distribution in a finite volume . the volume @xmath55 over which the points are distributed is taken to be much larger than volume of spheres ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the points are distributed randomly and we can use the binomial distribution . the probability of finding @xmath38 points in a sphere of volume @xmath56 centred on a point , if @xmath55 contains @xmath29 particles is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the probability that a given point ( out of @xmath29 ) is located in a randomly placed sphere .",
    "the probability of finding only one particle in such a sphere is not equal to @xmath58 , in general . if we place a sphere of volume @xmath56 inside a distribution which is contained in volume @xmath55 then @xmath59 .",
    "we shall assume in our calculations that @xmath60 .",
    "the above expression follows as with the cell centred on one point , this point is already in the cell and we need to compute the probability of @xmath61 points out of @xmath62 being in the cell . for comparison ,",
    "the probability of finding @xmath38 particles in a randomly placed sphere of volume @xmath56 is : @xmath63 the average number of points in a randomly placed sphere is @xmath64 and we assume that this is much larger than unity .",
    "thus we work in the situation where @xmath65 .",
    "moments of the distribution for cells centred at points can be related to moments for randomly placed cells . @xmath66",
    "the subscript @xmath58 on the angle brackets denotes that the average is for cells centred on points within the distribution .",
    "a specific application of the above expression is to compute the average number of points in a spherical cell .",
    "the average number of points in a sphere centred at a point is @xmath67 .",
    "the difference between the two expressions arises due to fluctuations that are present in an uncorrelated distribution of points .",
    "the generalised correlation integral can now be expressed in terms of the moments of this probability distribution . in the limit",
    "@xmath65 we can write down a leading order expression for the generalised correlation integral for @xmath68 as : @xmath69 here we have ignored terms that are of lower order in @xmath70 and terms of the same order in @xmath70 with powers of @xmath58 multiplying it .",
    "( see appendix a for a detailed discussion on how we arrived at this expression . )",
    "the minkowski - bouligand dimension corresponding to this is : @xmath71 to the same order .",
    "the last two terms in the intermediate expression for @xmath72 have a different origin : the first of the two terms arises due to fluctuations present in a random distribution and the second term arises due to the cells being centred at points within the distribution and this leads to weak clustering .",
    "a few points of significance are :    * we do not expect @xmath72 to coincide with the @xmath1 even if the distribution of points is homogeneous .",
    "thus the benchmark for a sample of points is not @xmath1 but @xmath72 given above , and if the minkowski - bouligand dimension for a distribution of points coincides with @xmath72 then it may be considered as a homogeneous distribution of points . *",
    "the correction due to a finite size sample always leads to a smaller value for @xmath72 than the @xmath1 . *",
    "the correction is small if @xmath73 , as expected .",
    "the correction arises primarily due to discreteness and has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of our approach is that we are able to derive an expression for the correction .",
    "we now consider weakly clustered distributions of points . in this case",
    "the counts , for spheres whose centres are randomly placed and for those centres are placed on the points in the distribution differ by a significant amount . also there is no simple way of relating the two and hence we can not use the approach we followed in the previous subsection for estimating the generalised correlation integral .    in order to make further progress , we note that we can always define an average density for a distribution of a finite number of points in a finite volume .",
    "this allows us to go a step further and also define @xmath74point correlation functions .",
    "it is well known that this can be used to relate the generalised correlation integral with @xmath74point correlation functions , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "we shall show below that it is possible to simplify this relation considerably in the limit of weak clustering .",
    "we can show that the correlation integral may be written as follows ( see appendix b for details ) .",
    "@xmath75 here we have used the assumption that @xmath76 and that higher powers of @xmath77 as well as higher order correlation functions can be ignored when compared to terms of order @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this assumption is over and above the limit @xmath65 .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side of this equation are same as the first two terms in the expression for @xmath49 that we derived for a homogeneous distribution of points .",
    "the third term encapsulates the contribution of clustering .",
    "this differs from the last term in the corresponding expression for a homogeneous distribution as in that case the `` clustering '' is only due to cells being centred at points whereas in this case the locations of every pair of points has a weak correlation .",
    "it is worth noting that the highest order term of order @xmath79 has a factor @xmath80 and hence can become important for sufficiently large @xmath44 .",
    "_ this may be quantified by stating that @xmath81 is the more relevant small parameter for this expansion .",
    "_    the minkowski - bouligand dimension for such a system can now be expressed in the form @xmath82 it is interesting to see that the departure of @xmath24 from @xmath1 due to a finite sample and weak clustering is given by distinct terms at the leading order .",
    "this expression allows us to compute @xmath24 for a distribution of points if the number density and @xmath77 are known .",
    "recall that @xmath1 is the mathematically defined fractal dimension for an infinite set of points with a homogeneous distribution .",
    "we have already noted some aspects of the correction due to a finite number of points in the previous section , here we would like to highlight aspects of corrections due to clustering .    * for hierarchical clustering",
    ", both terms have the same sign and lead to a smaller value for @xmath24 as compared to @xmath1 . *",
    "unless the correlation function has a feature at some scale , smaller correlation corresponds to a smaller correction to the minkowski - bouligand dimension .",
    "the expression given above quantifies this intuitive expectation .",
    "* note that for @xmath48 , the expression given here is exact . for this case ,",
    "the contribution of clustering has also been discussed by @xcite . *",
    "if the correlation function has a feature then it is possible to have a small correction term @xmath83 for a relatively large @xmath84 .",

    "this value of @xmath44 was chosen as the contribution of a finite number of galaxies does not vanish in this case .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath92 , the dashed line shows the contribution of clustering to @xmath87 and the dot - dashed line is the correction due to a finite number of galaxies .",
    "clearly , the correction due to clustering is the dominant reason for departure of @xmath24 from @xmath1 . ]      we have applied our method to the multinomial multi fractal model discussed in literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we assign a probability @xmath99 to each of these sub - squares @xmath100 .",

    "we performed this construction to @xmath102 levels , thus getting a @xmath103 lattice with the measure associated with each pixel .",
    "for such models the we have an analytical expression for the generalised dimension as @xmath104 this expression can be used to check whether our model for finite number and correlation work correctly or not .",

    "@xmath87 measured from a realisation are plotted as points , and our model is shown as a curve .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath108 , there is a visible deviation of @xmath24 from the expected value and that our model correctly estimates this deviation .    in other case",

    "we again find a good match between the model and measured values .",
    "it is significant that at very large @xmath89 , we model the deviation of @xmath24 from @xmath111 correctly .",

    "in summary we can say that our model works very well for the multinomial model and we find that the correction due to clustering as well as a finite number of points matches with the observed behaviour of @xmath24 .",

    "the two point correlation has been shown at large scales where the clustering can be assumed to be weak .",
    "the most prominent feature here is the peak near @xmath4 mpc .",
    "this peak is caused by baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) prior to decoupling ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "apart from this peak , the two point correlation function declines from small scales towards larger scales at length scales shown here .",
    "all observations of galaxies are carried out in redshift space .",
    "therefore we must use the correlation function in redshift space . at large scales , redshift space distortions caused by infall lead to an enhancement of the two point correlation function .",
    "the enhancement is mainly along the line of sight but the angle averaged two point correlation function is also amplified by some amount @xcite .",
    "further , we must also take into account the _ bias _ in the distribution of galaxies while using the correlation function shown in figure  3 .",
    "this has been discussed by many authors @xcite . at large scales",
    ", we may assume that the linear bias factor @xmath126 is sufficient for describing the redshift space distortions and clustering .",
    "lastly , we should mention that we are working with the linearly extrapolated correlation function at these scales even though there is some evidence that perturbative effects lead to a slight shift in the location of the peak in @xmath84 ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "the only change caused by such a shift in the location of the peak is to in turn shift the scale where there appears to be a transition from large values of @xmath87 towards small and constant values .",
    "as the shift does not alter our key conclusions , we will ignore such effects in the following discussion .",
    "we plot the expected departure of @xmath24 from @xmath1 for an unbiased sample of galaxies in figure  4 .",
    "we assumed that typical ( l * ) galaxies have an average number density of @xmath127  h@xmath96mpc@xmath95 and a bias factor of unity .",

    "for example , see @xcite .",
    "@xmath87 is negative at all scales shown here , as expected from the expression ( see eqn.([eqn : clus ] ) ) for hierarchical clustering .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath87 as a function of scale has two distinct regimes on either side of @xmath4  h@xmath131mpc .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath87 increases rapidly as we go from @xmath4  h@xmath131mpc towards smaller scales . at scales larger than @xmath4",
    "h@xmath131mpc , @xmath87 either stays constant or decreases at a very slow rate .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath87 around @xmath4  h@xmath131mpc is dictated largely by the bao peak in @xmath84 at this scale .",
    "although there is no peak in @xmath77 , @xmath132 has a minima and a maxima near the scale of the peak in @xmath5 .",
    "this results in a corresponding minima and maxima for @xmath87 as the contribution of a finite number of galaxies is subdominant at such large scales .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  5 where @xmath92 is plotted for an lrg like sample , and the two contributions ( from a finite sample and weak clustering ) are also shown .",
    "if @xmath84 has a power law form then there are no extrema for @xmath133 and the magnitude of both @xmath84 and @xmath87 becomes progressively smaller as we get to larger scales .",
    "there is a one to one relation between @xmath84 and @xmath87 for a given model of this type .",
    "however , a feature like the peak introduced by bao leads to the non - trivial behaviour illustrated in figure  4 . here",
    "we find that @xmath24 can be smaller at scales with a larger @xmath84 .",
    "for example , the scale with the local maxima of @xmath84 is very close to the scale with the local minima of @xmath24 .",
    "the intuitive correspondence of a small @xmath84 implying a smaller deviation of @xmath24 from @xmath1 does not apply in this case .",
    "the difference between the unbiased galaxy population , and an lrg like sample is stark .",
    "the lrg like sample has a minkowski - bouligand dimension that differs from @xmath134 by a significant amount .",
    "the main reason for this difference is the high bias factor associated with the lrg population , although a smaller number density also makes some difference .",
    "different clustering properties for different types of galaxies imply that these will have not have the same minkowski - bouligand dimension .",
    "this has no impact on determination of the scale of homogeneity for the universe , where we must use unbiased tracers .",
    "the calculations presented in the previous section allow us to estimate the offset of the minkowski - bouligand dimension from the physical dimension due to weak clustering and a finite sample .",
    "this has to be accompanied by a calculation of the dispersion in the expected values @xcite .",
    "the natural estimate for the scale of homogeneity is the scale where the offset of the minkowski - bouligand dimension from the physical dimension becomes smaller than the dispersion in a sufficiently large survey .",
    "given that the offset is dominated by the effect of clustering , we have @xmath135",
    ". the offset scales with @xmath44 .",
    "further , it is apparent that the dispersion in @xmath87 must also scale with @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the requirement of dispersion being greater than the offset leads to the same scale for all @xmath44 .",
    "this is a very satisfying feature of this approach in that the scale of homogeneity does not depend on the choice of @xmath44 as long as the effect of a finite number of points is subdominant .",
    "alternatively , we may argue that the scale of homogeneity should be identified with the scale above which the variation of @xmath87 is very small .",
    "while this is an acceptable prescription for typical galaxies where @xmath136 at scales above @xmath4  h@xmath131mpc , it does not appear reasonable for an lrg like population .",
    "the scale of homogeneity for the latter population is clearly much larger than @xmath4  h@xmath131mpc .",
    "we have studied the problem of the expected value of the minkowski - bouligand dimension for a finite distribution of points . for this purpose ,",
    "we have studied a homogeneous distribution as well as a weakly clustered distribution . in our study , @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    "are taken to be the small parameters and the deviation of @xmath24 from @xmath1 is estimated in terms of these quantities . in both cases",
    "we find that the expected values of the minkowski - bouligand dimension @xmath24 are different from @xmath1 for the distribution of points .",
    "for generic distributions , the value of @xmath24 is less than the dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we have derived an expression for @xmath24 in terms of the correlation function and the number density in the limit of weak clustering .",
    "_ it is remarkable that @xmath139 even for homogeneous distributions . _",
    "we find that @xmath140 is non - zero at all scales for unbiased tracers of mass in the concordance model in cosmology . for this model",
    "@xmath87 is a large negative number at small scales but it rapidly approaches zero at larger scales .",
    "@xmath87 is a very slowly varying function of scale above @xmath4  h@xmath131mpc and hence this may be tentatively identified as the scale of homogeneity for this model .",
    "a more quantitative approach requires us to estimate not only the systematic offset @xmath87 but the dispersion in this quantity .",
    "the scale of homogeneity can then be identified as the scale where the offset is smaller than the expected dispersion .",
    "we plan to undertake estimation of dispersion as the next step .",
    "verifying these results using simulated distributions of points is also on the agenda .",
    "although we have used the example of galaxy clustering for illustrating our calculations , the results as given in eqn.([eqn : homogen ] ) and eqn.([eqn : clus ] ) are completely general and apply to any distribution of points with weak departures from homogeneity . a detailed derivation of the relations presented here , with verification using mock distributions of points will be presented in a separate publication , where we also expect to highlight other applications .",

    "we require that the description should be accurate to first order in @xmath144 .",
    "the moment generating function for the binomial distribution is given by @xmath145 the @xmath146th moment of the distribution can then be calculated by differentiating @xmath147 with respect to @xmath148 , doing this @xmath146 times and then setting @xmath148 to zero .",
    "the @xmath146th derivative of @xmath149 , at @xmath150 can be written as : @xmath151 where @xmath152 satisfies the following recurrence relation @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 for @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",

    "but if we assume that @xmath60 and @xmath162 then we can rewrite the expression in the following form : @xmath163 where we have retained terms up to @xmath164 and have dropped all other terms . we have also used the recurrence relation and find that @xmath165 .",
    "we can now write the correlation integral as : @xmath166    the minkowski - bouligand dimension is then given by @xmath167   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & d\\left(1-\\frac{(q-2)}{2\\bar{n } } - \\frac{1}{\\bar{n}}\\right ) \\label{eq : app3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the dimension of the space in which particles are distributed . in this calculation , we have again made use of the fact that @xmath73 and that it scales as the @xmath1th power of scale @xmath16 for a random distribution .",
    "in this section we will derive the form of the correlation integral for a weakly clustered distribution of points . consider a sphere of volume @xmath56 contained within the sample of volume @xmath55 .",

    "we divide the sphere into infinitesimal elements such that each element contains at most one point .",

    "further , it can be shown that the contributions that contain only a single power of @xmath84 from other terms in the series in eqn.([eq : app4 ] ) contain a lower power of @xmath70 .",
