    "<S> in - plane torque measurements were performed on heavy fermion cecoin@xmath0 single crystals in the temperature @xmath1 range @xmath2 k @xmath3 k and applied magnetic field @xmath4 up to 14 t. the normal - state torque is given by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the reversible part of the mixed - state torque , obtained after subtracting the corresponding normal state torque , shows also a four - fold symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , sharp peaks are present in the irreversible torque at angles of @xmath64 , 3@xmath7/4 , 5@xmath7/4 , 7@xmath7/4 , etc . both the four - fold symmetry in the reversible torque and the sharp peaks in the irreversible torque of the mixed state imply @xmath8 symmetry of the superconducting order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the field and temperature dependences of the reversible mixed - state torque provide further evidence for @xmath8 wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the four - fold symmetry in the normal state has a different origin since it has different field and temperature dependences than the one in the mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> the possible reasons of the normal state four - fold symmetry are discussed .      </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity in the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath0 is unconventional as exemplified by the non - fermi liquid behavior,@xcite the giant nernst effect present in the normal state , @xcite its proximity to quantum critical points , @xcite the pauli limiting effect , @xcite and the possible multiband picture in the superconducting state.@xcite unconventional superconductivity is always a subject of great interest . </S>",
    "<S> knowing the pairing symmetry , which is related to the ground state and gap energy , is essential to the understanding of the pairing mechanism and the origin of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> for a conventional superconductor , which is described by the bcs theory , the pairing is phonon mediated and the pairing symmetry is @xmath9 wave . for an unconventional superconductor , the quasiparticle gap vanishes at certain points on the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> for example , most of the experimental evidence on high temperature superconductors , such as yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12 , indicates that the @xmath13 wave symmetry dominates in these materials .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been established that the superconducting order parameter of cecoin@xmath0 displays @xmath14-wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 in and @xmath16co nuclear magnetic resonance measurements@xcite and torque measurements@xcite have revealed a suppressed spin susceptibility , which implies singlet spin pairing . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath17 term is present in the low temperature @xmath1 specific heat , consistent with the presence of nodes in the superconducting energy gap.@xcite nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on cecoin@xmath0 have revealed that the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath18 has no hebel - slichter coherence peak just below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath19 , and it has a @xmath20 dependence at very low temperatures , which indicates the existence of line nodes in the superconducting energy gap.@xcite    nevertheless , the direction of the gap nodes relative to the brillouin zone axes , which determines the type of @xmath14-wave state , namely @xmath13 or @xmath8 , is still an open question and an extremely controversial issue . </S>",
    "<S> for example , angular dependent thermal conductivity measurements in a magnetic field have revealed four - fold symmetry consistent with @xmath13 symmetry.@xcite neutron scattering experiments by eskildsen et al . revealed a square lattice oriented along [ 110 ] , </S>",
    "<S> also consistent with @xmath13 wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , field - angle - dependent specific heat measurements have found the symmetry of the superconducting gap to be @xmath8.@xcite furthermore , theoretical calculations by ikeda et al . </S>",
    "<S> strongly suggest @xmath8 wave symmetry when taking into account the available @xmath21 experimental data of the fflo states@xcite [ @xmath21 is the temperature at which the upper critical field @xmath22 changes from second order to first order ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , recent calculations by tanaka et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite based on the fermi liquid theory and by vorontsov et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite based on a unified microscopic approach , support the @xmath13 gap symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> this extremely controversial issue needs to be resolved through an experimental technique that allows the direct measurement of the nodal positions . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments which are phase sensitive usually include surface or boundary effects , while the experiments which detect bulk properties are not phase sensitive . in the study presented here we use torque measurements to clarify the gap symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> torque is a bulk measurement so it provides information on the order parameter of the bulk , not only the surface . </S>",
    "<S> ( the order parameter of the surface might be different from that of the bulk ) . </S>",
    "<S> it also _ directly _ probes the nodal positions on the fermi surface with high angular resolution since torque is the angular derivative of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , such an experimental technique is ideal to determine the direction of the gap nodes relative to the brillouin zone axes and , in fact , it has already been successfully used to identify the nodal positions of untwinned yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12 single crystals@xcite and tl@xmath10ba@xmath10cuo@xmath23 thin films.@xcite in addition , recent theoretical calculations by h. adachi have shown that low - field torque measurements can be used to detect the nodal positions of a @xmath14-wave superconductor with a small fermi - surface anisotropy,@xcite as is the case of cecoin@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> in - plane torque measurements were performed on single crystals of cecoin@xmath0 both in the normal state and in the mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> normal - state torque shows a four - fold symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the reversible part of the angular dependent mixed - state torque data , obtained after subtracting the corresponding normal state torque , also shows a four - fold symmetry with a positive coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 and @xmath4 dependences of the coefficients of the four - fold torques in the normal and mixed states are different . hence </S>",
    "<S> , these two four - fold symmetries have clearly different origin . </S>",
    "<S> sharp peaks in the irreversible torque data were observed at angles equal with @xmath64 , 3@xmath7/4 , 5@xmath7/4 , and 7@xmath7/4 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the free energy extracted from the four - fold symmetry of the reversible torque of the mixed state coupled with the position of the sharp peaks in the irreversible torque of the mixed state point unambiguously towards @xmath8 wave symmetry in cecoin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> further support for the @xmath8 wave symmetry is provided by the @xmath4 and @xmath1 dependence of the mixed - state reversible torque .      </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of cecoin@xmath0 were grown using the flux method . </S>",
    "<S> high quality crystals with regular shape and shiny surfaces were chosen to carry out the torque measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the single crystals were etched in concentrated hcl for several hours to remove the indium left on the surface during the growth process . </S>",
    "<S> the crystals were then rinsed thoroughly in ethanol .    </S>",
    "<S> a piezoresistive torque magnetometer was used to measure the angular dependence of the in - plane torque of cecoin@xmath0 both in the normal state and mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> the torque was measured over a large temperature range ( 1.8 k @xmath24 10 k ) and magnetic field @xmath4 range ( 1.5 t @xmath25 14 t ) by rotating the single crystal in fixed magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath26 for the in - plane rotation was defined as the angle made by the field with the @xmath27-axis of the single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the gravity and puck to the total torque signal were measured and subtracted from it as discussed elsewhere.@xcite    the experiments were carried out in a physical property measurement system ( ppms ) . in such a system with a one axis rotator , it is very difficult to ensure an in - plane alignment of better than about @xmath28 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> if misalignment exists , i.e. the magnetic field is not completely within the @xmath29 plane of the single crystal , there should be a @xmath30 term [ see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the angular - dependent in - plane torque signal has a @xmath30 term [ @xmath31 and @xmath26 of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) are @xmath26 and @xmath32 , respectively , in the present case ] in addition to the @xmath33 term . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the amplitude of the measured @xmath30 term gives a misalignment @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we attribute this @xmath30 term to the misalignment of the single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the torque data shown in this paper are after subtracting this @xmath30 term .      </S>",
    "<S> previously , we have shown that the @xmath35-axis rotation torque signal measured in the mixed state has a paramagnetic component which is comparable with the diamagnetic component.@xcite the former component is a result of the anisotropy of the susceptibilities along the @xmath27 and @xmath36 axes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , such a paramagnetic torque signal is absent in the present measurements in which the torque is measured while rotating the single crystal along the @xmath36 axis , since @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , @xmath1 and @xmath4 dependent torque measurements in the normal state reveal that the normal - state torque signal is not negligible , is reversible , and it has a four - fould symmetry [ see inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] . the solid line is a fit of the data with @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the field and temperature dependence of the amplitude @xmath39 , gives the @xmath4 and @xmath1 dependence of the normal - state torque . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath39 has an @xmath40 dependence up to 14 t for all measured temperatures from 1.9 k to 10 k [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . as the temperature increases , the slope of the plots in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the temperature dependence of @xmath41 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ; i.e. , @xmath41 increases , hence @xmath39 decreases , with increasing @xmath1 . a straight line fit of the data with @xmath42 gives @xmath43 k , which has a value close to the single ion kondo temperature @xmath44 [ reported to be between 1 and 2 k , ref.@xcite ) ] and @xmath45 t@xmath46n@xmath47m@xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in approaching the superconducting transition , @xmath39 decreases with decreasing @xmath4 and increases with decreasing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we subtract the corresponding normal - state torque from the torque measured in the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> the torque data measured in the mixed state of cecoin@xmath0 , obtained by subtracting the corresponding normal - state torque from the measured torque , have both reversible and irreversible components . the reversible torque @xmath49 is the average of the torque data measured in clockwise and anti - clockwise directions , while the irreversible torque @xmath50 is the average of the antisymmetric components of the torque data measured in clockwise and anti - clockwise directions . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(a ) shows the reversible part of the angular dependent in - plane torque data measured in the mixed state at 1.9 k and in a magnetic field of 3 t. clearly , there is a four - fold symmetry present in the torque data , although the data points are somewhat scattered . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a fit of these mixed - state data with @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath52 is positive since the torque displays a maximum at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(b ) shows the irreversible part of the mixed - state torque data @xmath54 measured at @xmath55 k and @xmath56 t for a single crystal with a mass of 2.6 mg . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath54 data have sharp peaks at @xmath64 , 3@xmath7/4 , 5@xmath7/4 , and 7@xmath7/4 , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> the nodal positions of cecoin@xmath0 can be obtained from the reversible and irreversible mixed - state torque data , as previously done in the study of yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath57.@xcite specifically , theoretical calculations predict that the in - plane upper critical field @xmath58 has a four - fold symmetry for a @xmath14-wave superconductor.@xcite in the case of @xmath8 wave symmetry , the angular variation of the upper critical field @xmath59 ; hence , it has maxima at @xmath64 , 3@xmath7/4 , 5@xmath7/4 , 7@xmath7/4 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows the angular dependence of the reversible and irreversible torque obtained by starting from this angular dependence of @xmath60 , as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the lower critical field @xmath61 is out of phase with @xmath58 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) since the thermodynamic critical field @xmath62 is independent of the magnetic field orientation . therefore , the magnetization @xmath63 , given by m@xmath64 , has the same angular dependence as @xmath60 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the easy axis of magnetization ( maximum magnetization ) should correspond to free energy @xmath65 minima . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , for the @xmath8 symmetry , @xmath65 has minima at @xmath64 , 3@xmath7/4 , 5@xmath7/4 , 7@xmath7/4 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . the torque is the angular derivative of the free energy @xmath65 ; i.e. , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the reversible torque data for a material with @xmath8 wave symmetry should display a four - fold symmetry with maxima at @xmath53 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , etc ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . also , </S>",
    "<S> the free energy minima act as intrinsic pinning centers for vortices , so the irreversible torque data for a material with @xmath8 wave symmetry should display peaks at the same angles at which the free energy has minima ; i.e. , at @xmath69 , 3@xmath7/4 , 5@xmath7/4 , 7@xmath7/4 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the angular dependence of reversible and irreversible torque data of cecoin@xmath0 shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) is the same as the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , obtained from the theoretically predicted angular dependence of the upper critical fields for a material with @xmath8 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the reversible along with the irreversible torque data in the mixed state unambiguously imply that the wave symmetry of cecoin@xmath0 is @xmath8 .    to further understand the four - fold symmetry displayed by the present torque measurements in the mixed state </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the field and temperature dependence of the amplitude @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 is a plot of the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath52 , which gives the @xmath4 dependence of the torque , obtained by fitting the angular dependent torque data measured in different magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath70 increases with increasing @xmath4 , reaches a maximum , and then decreases with further increasing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> also note that the four - fold symmetry vanishes close to @xmath58 ( @xmath71 t ) . </S>",
    "<S> this field dependence of the magnitude of @xmath52 is the same as the field dependence of the basal - plane reversible torque in the mixed state of a layered @xmath72 wave superconductor [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 8(a ) of ref . @xcite ] calculated by adachi et al.@xcite based on the quasiclassical version of the bcs - gorkov theory with a fermi surface which is isotropic within the basal plane . </S>",
    "<S> the sign difference between the data of the present fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 8(a ) of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is for a @xmath72 wave symmetry , further indicates that the present data reflect @xmath8 symmetry since the torque data have opposite signs for the @xmath8 and @xmath72 wave symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 is a plot of the temperature dependence of the amplitude @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath52 , hence the torque , decreases with increasing @xmath1 and vanishes towards @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that both the @xmath1 and @xmath4 dependences of the reversible mixed - state torque vanish at the superconducting - normal state phase boundary further indicates that the observed four - fold symmetry is related with superconductivity ; hence , it reflects the gap symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the behaviors of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are totally different ( compare figs . 1 and 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so the four - fold symmetries present in normal and mixed states have different origin . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the four - fold symmetry in the normal state is not yet clear to us .    </S>",
    "<S> torque measurements on lacoin@xmath0 single crystals , which also have a tetragonal structure but are not superconducting and the @xmath75 electrons are absent , give some clues on the normal state four - fold symmetry of cecoin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependent torque data for lacoin@xmath0 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . clearly , the @xmath33 symmetry observed in cecoin@xmath0 is completely absent here . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the normal - state torque between cecoin@xmath0 and lacoin@xmath0 could be due to the presence of heavy electrons in the former compound and their absence in the latter one . </S>",
    "<S> the crystalline electric field , which is important in heavy fermion systems , might be responsible for the four - fold symmetry in the normal - state torque . </S>",
    "<S> also , the field induced order , possibly quadrupolar order , could be another reason for the four - fold symmetry in the normal - state torque of cecoin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> no doubt , the origin of this normal - state four - fold symmetry present in the torque data requires further study . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this is beyond the scope of this paper .      in - plane angular dependent torque measurements </S>",
    "<S> were performed on cecoin@xmath0 single crystals both in the normal and mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> normal - state torque measurements show a four - fold symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the reversible torque in the mixed state , obtained after subtracting the corresponding normal state contribution , also shows a four - fold symmetry with maxima at @xmath53 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> sharp peaks in the irreversible torque data were observed at @xmath69 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> these latter peaks correspond to minima in the free energy of a @xmath8 wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the mixed state four - fold symmetry and the peak positions in the irreversible torque point unambiguously towards @xmath8 wave symmetry of the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> the field and temperature dependences of the amplitude of the normal - state torque is different from that of the mixed - state torque , which indicates that the normal - state torque has a different origin . </S>",
