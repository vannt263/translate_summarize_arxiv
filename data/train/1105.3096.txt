    "elements in the mass range a=6090 are produced by neutron capture on iron seed nuclei during the core helium and shell carbon burning phases in massive stars .",
    "the element production of this _ weak s process _ depends heavily on the neutron density , the main neutron source being the reaction @xmath7ne@xmath8 mg @xcite . during the s process",
    ", neutrons are captured by seed nuclei in the fe region , slowly building up heavier elements .",
    "as the rate of neutron captures is slow compared to the decay rate of unstable reaction products element production follows the valley of stability .",
    "the neutron density in the burning environment is one of the parameters that determines the final abundance and the end point of the reaction path . at the same time",
    ", isotopes with high abundance or high neutron capture cross sections can capture a large amount of free neutrons , thereby acting as a neutron poison in the burning environment .",
    "recent results from calculations of massive , fast rotating stars at low metallicity showed a large increase in the s process isotope production over the yields from non - rotating stars @xcite . due to the lower abundance of heavier neutron poisons like @xmath9 mg in low - metallicity conditions",
    ", @xmath10o becomes the dominant neutron poison via the reaction @xmath10o(n,@xmath11o .",
    "the captured neutrons can then be released again by the reaction @xmath0o@xmath12ne depending on the strength of the competing reaction channel @xmath0o@xmath1ne .",
    "the competition of the two reaction channels determines the influence of the poisoning effect of @xmath10o and , thus , the mass range of the produced elements .",
    "in addition , it has a strong effect on the expected yields @xcite .    the two stellar burning phases in which the s process takes place in massive stars are core helium and shell carbon burning at temperatures of t = 0.3 gk and 1 gk , respectively .",
    "for the reaction @xmath0o@xmath13 , @xmath14-energies of around 0.6 mev and 1.3 mev are therefore important .",
    "the reaction @xmath0o@xmath15ne has previously been measured in the energy range between e@xmath16 0.6 mev and 12.5 mev @xcite , but so far no experimental data exist on the @xmath0o@xmath1ne ( q = 7347.9 kev ) reaction .",
    "reaction rates given in the compilation by caughlan and fowler @xcite and by descouvemont derived from a theoretical calculation @xcite differ by up to four orders of magnitude in the relevant energy range .",
    "this leads to substantially different elemental overproductions of the s elements in low - metallicity rotating stars @xcite .",
    "because of this enormous uncertainty in the reaction rate , experimental data are of critical importance as input for more accurate s - process simulations .",
    "the @xmath14-beam was provided by the 4mv kn accelerator at the university of notre dame nuclear science laboratory . energy calibration and resolution ( 1.1 kev )",
    "were determined using the well - known e@xmath17 kev and e@xmath18 kev resonances in @xmath19al @xcite .",
    "the beam energy was reproducible within @xmath20 kev between different hysteresis cycles of the analyzing magnet during the course of the experiment .",
    "the beam current on target was kept in the range of 10 @xmath21a to 30 @xmath21a in order to limit target degradation . to reduce carbon deposition a liquid nitrogen cooled copper tube ( cold finger )",
    "was mounted in front of the target .",
    "a bias of -400 v was applied to the cold finger for suppression of secondary electrons .",
    "the beam was rastered with magnetic steerers to produce a beam spot of size 1.4 cm @xmath22 1.6 cm on the target .",
    "the target was mounted at @xmath23 with respect to the beam direction and was directly water cooled with deionized water .",
    "the target chamber was electrically isolated for charge collection .",
    "targets were prepared by anodization of 0.3 mm thick tantalum backings using h@xmath24o enriched to 90.1% in @xmath0o ( the @xmath25o content of the water was specified to be 0.4% ) .",
    "this process is known to produce homogeneous films of ta@xmath24o@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the film thickness can be controlled in a reproducible way through regulation of the maximal anodization voltage .",
    "the target thickness was chosen to be about 12 kev for an @xmath14-beam of 1000 kev .",
    "a ge detector with an efficiency of 55% with respect to nai at e@xmath27 kev was set up at an angle of @xmath23 with respect to the beam axis . to reduce the radiation damage from the strong @xmath0o@xmath12ne channel , a polyethylene disk",
    "8.3 cm in diameter and 2.0 cm thick was attached to the front cap of the detector to scatter reaction neutrons away from the ge crystal . to optimize efficiency the detector",
    "was then positioned in close geometry , resulting in a distance of 2.9 cm between target and detector .",
    "the target chamber and the detector itself were surrounded by at least 4.5 cm of lead to suppress natural background radiation .",
    "the lead shielding reduced a natural background line from @xmath28pb at e@xmath29 kev by a factor of 20 , enabling a clearer signal from the dominant transition in @xmath30ne ( e@xmath31 kev ) .",

    "measurements with a @xmath44ba source were performed with the detector at the close distance ( 2 cm ) and with the detector retracted to a larger distance ( 12.4 cm ) to investigate summing effects on the efficiency determination .",
    "the influence of summing on the ba measurements can be determined as follows : the transitions which can be affected by summing involve photons with energies e@xmath45 kev and e@xmath46 kev .",
    "there was enough absorbing material between source and detector ( 0.25 mm tantalum backing , 1 mm brass target holder and the 2 cm thick polyethylene disk ) to attenuate low - energy photons by approximately 98% , resulting in summing corrections of less than 0.5% .",
    "a comparison between ba measurements in close and in far geometry showed no difference in the relative intensities of the @xmath5-ray peaks , as would be expected without summing effects .",
    "the geant4 simulation was also used to investigate the difference between point and area sources on the detector efficiency .",

    "the effect was found to be less than 1% .",
    "in addition to these absolute measurements , relative efficiency data were augmented using the 1317 kev resonance in @xmath34al(p,@xmath35si and with a @xmath48co source .",

    "the e@xmath31 kev transition from the first excited state to the ground state in the @xmath30ne compound nucleus was observed .",

    "considerations of the balance of the feeding and the decay of intermediate states show that about 30% of primary transitions are unobserved .",
