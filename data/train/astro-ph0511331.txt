    "the insight that clustered star formation may be the dominant mode for star formation has grown over the last years .",
    "the form of the true distribution of stellar masses within these clusters , of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , has been a subject of debate for a long time .",
    "the evolution of the stars , unresolved binaries , and the dynamical evolution of the clusters complicates the observational efforts to extract the imf .",
    "unfortunately the most promising objects , very young stellar clusters ( age @xmath3 3 myr ) , are often still embedded in their natal cloud - again aggravating observations .",
    "nevertheless the distribution of stars in young clusters seems to be fairly well described by a multi power - law function with a slope or index ( @xmath4 ) of 2.35 ( the so - called salpeter value ) for stars with a mass larger than @xmath5 @xcite . the initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of stars in the mass interval @xmath8 .",
    "several observations find the salpeter value ( @xmath9 ) for a large variety of conditions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to describe the _ stellar imf _ with an invariant , multi - power law form @xcite , @xmath10    we refer to this form as the standard or canonical stellar imf because this form fits the luminosity function of galactic - field and cluster stars below 1 @xmath11 and also represents young populations above 1 @xmath11 @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite",
    "though , significant uncertainties remain in the determination of the imf to the point that the case can also be made that a single form of the imf may not exist . in view of this , the ansatz made here and elsewhere is to propose the hypothesis of an invariant standard or canonical imf ( eq .",
    "[ kroupa - imf ] ) and to test if the variation of the observed imf can be understood to be the result of astrophysical effects ( obscuration , stellar evolution , stellar multiplicity ) , dynamical effects ( mass segregation , stellar evaporation and ejections ) , stochastic effects ( finite @xmath12-sampling from the imf ) and the construction of composite populations ( addition of many different clusters ) .",
    "similarly , the embedded cluster mass function ( ecmf ) has been found to be well - described by at least one power - law , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of embedded clusters in the mass interval @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 is the cluster mass in stars .",
    "the observational evidence points to a possibly universal form of the ecmf : @xcite find a slope @xmath17 in the solar neighbourhood for clusters with masses between 50 and 1000 @xmath11 , while @xcite find @xmath18 for @xmath19 in the smc and lmc , and @xcite find @xmath20 for @xmath21 in the antennae galaxies .",
    "@xcite discovered that @xmath22 best reproduces the observed correlation between the brightest young cluster and the galaxy - wide star - formation - rate for a large sample of late - type galaxies .",
    "as already mentioned by @xcite and discussed in more detail by @xcite , the composite or integrated galaxial stellar imf ( igimf ) is obtained by summing up the stellar imfs contributed by all the star clusters that formed over the age of a galaxy , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ecmf and @xmath25 is the stellar imf in a particular cluster within which the maximal mass of a star is @xmath26 .",

    "a critical function entering this description is thus @xmath30 . assuming the stellar imf to be a continuous distribution function , this mass of the most massive star in an embedded cluster with the total mass @xmath15 in stars is given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 since there exists exactly one most massive star in each cluster , and neglecting statistical variations . here",

    "@xcite infer that a fundamental upper stellar mass limit , @xmath37 , appears to exist above which stars do not occur , unless @xmath38 , in which case no conclusions can be drawn based on the expected number of massive stars . as reviewed by @xcite , the existence of such a stellar upper mass limit has been further substantiated by @xcite and @xcite for a range of star clusters and ob associations .",

    "the implications of these findings are rather significant for the supernova rate @xcite and for the chemical evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "but these results remain not without a challenge .",
    "@xcite argues that there is no evidence of a relation @xmath41 .",
    "this relation implies that many small , low - mass , star - forming events will not have the same combined imf as one major sf event of the same mass .",
    "thus , according to @xcite , @xmath42 clusters each with a mass of @xmath43 would provide a combined imf that differs from that of one cluster with a mass of @xmath44 by being underrepresented in stars with a mass above about @xmath45 .",
    "the contrary , often voiced view is that stellar masses sample the imf purely statistically such that @xmath42 clusters containing 50 stars ( on average 20 @xmath11 ) will give the same combined imf as one cluster containing @xmath46 stars @xcite .    with this contribution",
    "we demonstrate conclusively that the purely statistical notion is false , and that the stellar imf is sampled to a maximum stellar mass that correlates with the cluster mass . therewith we affirm the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite , and we also attain useful insights into the process of star - cluster formation .    in section  [ sec : maxstmass ] our monte - carlo procedure",
