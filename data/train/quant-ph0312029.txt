    "a quantum key distribution or generation scheme for two legitimate users(alice and bob ) is one of the most interesting subjects in quantum information science , which was pioneered by c.bennett and g.brassard in 1984[1 ] . in addition , several variations for the key generation protocol have been proposed[2 ] .",
    "we emphasize that such results are great achievement and open a new science .",
    "many researchers believe that the key distribution by single photon is on the verge of commercial application .",
    "however we should take into account the fact that the societies of electronics and communication , and of cryptography are basically not interested in the practical use of quantum cryptography based on single photon schemes .",
    "although there is no means of solving such a serious argument , we would like to make the following comment .",
    "the key distribution or generation is a very important , but it is very narrow sense that one defines quantum cryptography by only bb-84 and similar principle .",
    "yuen , kumar , and their group have pointed out that the quantum cryptography should involve other aspects , and called quantum information scientist s attention to quantum cryptography based on another principle .",
    "it is clear that the single photon based bb-84 have serious performance limitations[3 ] , such as possible communication distance and key rate , if the customer wants to use them at modern digital communication network so called super digital highway .",
    "the research like gisin s work[4 ] to cope with such limitations and coherent state based bb-84 should be encouraged , and also research like northwestern university s group to investigate another scheme for achieving the same function should be welcome .",
    "so we would like to support both types of research .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make a comment on the recent paper of a criticism[5 ] to the yuen protocol . in cryptography ,",
    "trials of attack to proposed protocol are essential .",
    "so consideration of attack on y-00 is welcome .",
    "but one should follow the basic principle of the proposed protocol , before to attack it . in this sense",
    ", the nishioka et al attacks[5 ] basically is not grounded on an appropriate theory . as a result",
    ", there is misunderstanding on the yuen protocol .",
    "we will clarify their mistakes in this paper .",
    "to reader who ask for more fruitful results , we recommend reference [ 6 ] .",
    "in 2000 , the basis of the present y-00 was proposed , which is a new kind of quantum cryptography based on a different principle[6 , 7 ] . in 2002 ,",
    "several concrete implementations have been realized[8 , 9 ] . in these papers",
    "it is called @xmath1 scheme .",
    "let us mention first what is basic concept in their idea .",
    "there are many fundamental theorems in quantum information theory .",
    "the most important theorem for information processing of classical information by quantum states is the following : +   + * theorem 1 * : + _ signals with nonorthogonal states can not be distinguished without error and optimum lower bounds for error rate exist . _",
    "+   + this means that if we assign nonorthogonal states for bit values 1 and 0 , then one can not distinguish 1 and 0 without error .",
    "when the error probability is 1/2 based on quantum noise , there is no way to distinguish them , from quantum detection theory[10 ] . on the other hand , in the quantum case",
    ", one has to take a quantum attack into account .",
    "so one needs the well known quantum no - cloning theorem .",
    "+   + * theorem 2 * : + _ nonorthogonal states can not be cloned without error . _ + a fundamental requirement of secure communication is , first , to establish that the channel between alice and eve is very noisy , but the channel of alice and bob is kept as a normal communication channel by physical structure . to realize it",
    ", yuen employed a combination of a shared short key for the legitimate users and a kind of stream cipher with specific modulation scheme , following the above two theorems .",
    "we note that a main idea in his protocol is the explicit use of a shared short key and physical nature of scheme for cryptographic objective of secure communication and key generation . and also",
    ", one can say that the origin of security comes from receiver performance with versus without key .",
    "according to his paper , the application of y-00 is , first , a direct encryption stream cipher in conventional cryptography , and then to extend to key generation , but not one - time pad which is very inefficient .",
    "here we emphasize that one should employ different security criteria for direct encryption and key generation . for direct encryption with unavoidable channel noise ,",
    "the criteria are given as follows .",
    "+   + * criteria of security * :    * ciphertext - only attack on data and on key : to get plaintext or key , eve knows only the ciphertext from her measurement .",
    "* known / chosen plaintext attack : to get key , eve inserts her known or chosen plaintext data into modulation system ( for example , inserts all 0 sequence as text ) . then eve tries to determine key from input - output . using the key",
    ", eve can determine the data from the ciphertext .    for key generation ,",
    "unconditional security is preferable .    here",
    "let us introduce a structure of y-00 .",
    "the data bit is modulated by @xmath2-ary keying driven by pseudo random number generator .",
    "the @xmath2-ary keying has @xmath2 different basis based on 2@xmath2 coherent states .",
    "so the data bit is mapped into one of 2@xmath2 coherent states randomly . in general ,",
    "the quantum information system is described by a density operator .",
    "the density operator of the output of the coding / modulation system of y-00 as seen by the attack for ciphertext - only individual attack is @xmath3 where @xmath4 the probability @xmath5 depends on the statistics of the data , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 depend on the pseudo random number with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 being even and odd number , for example .",
    "eve has to extract the data from the quantum system with such a density operator .",
    "according to one of the most fundamental theorem(theorem 1 ) in quantum information theory , the accuracy of eve s measurement is limited . for ciphertext only attack , the best way of eve is of course given by the quantum optimum detection for two mixed states : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "that is , the accuracy of measurement of eve is as follows : @xmath12 as shown in references [ 8,9 ] , the error probability of eve as determined by the quantum limit is @xmath13 from the appropriate choice of the number @xmath2 and signal energy .",
    "it means that eve s data is completely inaccurate .",
    "in addition , _ a overlap selection keying_:*osk * was proposed in references [ 11,12 ] , based on the discussion with yuen .",
    "each set of basis state is used for @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , depending on sub running key .",
    "@xmath16 the density operators of 1 and 0 for eve are @xmath17 . so eve can not completely estimate information bits .",
    "this is an advantage of the osk . for known / chosen plaintext attack",
    ", eve knows the data .",
    "so the best way for eve is to detect 2@xmath2 pure coherent states which convey directly running key sequence . in this case , the accuracy of the data is also given by the quantum detection for 2@xmath2 pure coherent states[10,11,12 ] and the data involve unavoidable error given by @xmath18 for appropriate @xmath2 and signal energy , we have @xmath19 . as a result ,",
    "eve s data involves unavoidable error even in any attack schemes , and she can not get any meaningful information .    thus , y-00 is a new type of quantum cryptography based on quantum detection theory .",
    "that is , the security is guaranteed by quantum noise , but the system can be implemented by conventional devices . _ as quantum advantage , y-00 provides secrecy against quantum computer and quantum attacks_. we can summarize the property of y-00 as follows :    * direct encryption * + in the cipher - text only attack , y-00 may exceed the classical shannon limit .",
    "that is , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is information , @xmath22 is ciphertext as `` measured value '' for eve , and @xmath23 is initial seed key . even with @xmath24 , intuitively , the search complexity is between @xmath25and @xmath26 in y-00 , @xmath27 . for known plaintext attack , it will be expected that @xmath28 which corresponds to * information theoretic security*.    as a result , y-00 may provides information - theoretically secure scheme with very efficient performance for direct encryption .    * key generation",
    "* + the condition for secure key generation is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is bob s observation with knowledge of the seed key .",
    "recently it has been claimed that the key generation scheme using y-00 with several randomizations can be * unconditionally secure*[6 ] .    in order to realize the above performance ,",
    "several new randomizations will be introduced in reference [ 6 ] .",
    "we would like to show additional property of y-00 here .",
    "the structure of yuen protocol is formed by physical processes with specific modulator performance and so on .",
    "this means that the protocol is different with conventional cryptography formulated by mathematical concept , even the scheme is constructed by devices based on classical physics .",
    "it is called `` physical cryptography '' . since the protocol is constructed by combination of physical processes",
    ", one can devise a new randomization that is possible with physics to increase the security . as a result",
    ", y-00 may have better performance than conventional cryptography even the system is classical one . that is , to our surprise , this is a new type of stream cipher in the classical limit even in conventional cryptography .",
    "then the security of y-00 is enhanced by classical noise and also quantum nature of the system .",
    "these facts are essential in order to understand y-00 .",
    "recently nishioka et al[5]have given an attack scheme on y-00 as key generation scheme based on a relation of @xmath2-ary coding .",
    "but the original paper[8,9 ] of y-00 is of direct encryption .",
    "thus , although it involves many misunderstanding , in this section we try to use their scheme by the correct way in order to check whether it has a sense as an attack on y-00",
    ". then we will point out that the proposed attack scheme is meaningless even if the system is a completely noiseless classical system , and also basis(eq(9 ) ) of their claim has no essential role for y-00 .",
    "their logic is that one can neglect the noise effect by choosing appropriate indirect observable for the data bit , and it reduces to less noisy or classical noiseless model.then by combination of one - time pad for classical communication process , the security of the total system is equivalent to conventional stream cipher .",
    "it seems that their claim is that _",
    "y-00 corresponds to a classical cryptosystem , because @xmath31 up to @xmath32 which means that there is no possibility of key generation , i.e , obtaining a new key from @xmath21 statistically independent of @xmath23 , even when the data is information - theoretically secure_.    although their logic is not grounded on an appropriate theory , here we can verify their misunderstand .",
    "let us show their scheme .",
    "in order to clarify the essential point , we employ one mode classical @xmath2-ary phase shift keying signals .",
    "that is , we do not need quantum signals(coherent state and so on ) . here",
    "we use their notations . the attack scheme to classical y-00",
    "can be summarized as follows : the phase sift keying scheme used in y-00 of reference [ 8 ] is taken to be @xmath33 on the phase space , where @xmath34 is one of two regions separated by appropriate basis on the phase space .",
    "if the appropriate axis is horizontal axis , @xmath35 is upper plain , @xmath36 is down plain .",
    "@xmath37 is true random data bit .",
    "@xmath38 is 0 for even number and 1 for odd number in the running key of @xmath2-ary assignment .",
    "eq(9 ) indeed holds as the coding scheme in the original scheme . for example , @xmath39 let us define the sequences of numbers @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 as follows : @xmath43    first we analyze direct encryption based on their scheme .",
    "let @xmath23 , and @xmath44 be an initial key with length @xmath45 , and length @xmath46 of pseudo random number , respectively .",
    "the essential point of their attack is to measure indirect observable @xmath47 .",
    "however , since the observable does not contain the information of the data bit , they are asked to use the brute force attack for key to find a correct sequence of the data . here",
    "we can define that @xmath48 is a set of data random number sequence with the length of @xmath46 .",
    "alice sends a sequence @xmath49 in @xmath48 , and it is coded based on eq(9 ) with a @xmath50 , @xmath51 . the proposed attack requires the measurement of @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath34 of @xmath47 depends on the axis selected on phase space at the first step . here",
    ", let the horizontal axis be the selected axis .",
    "so @xmath52 is up or down .",
    "@xmath53 in the attack scheme in their paper correspond to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath50 corresponds to pseudo random number sequence which has a number of possibilities of @xmath25 and the length @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath49 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 be true sequences used and defined on the phase space for alice and bob .",
    "let @xmath58 be the measurement result .",
    "she tries to assign all kind of @xmath50 to her measured sequence @xmath58 .",
    "so she gets a set @xmath59 based on @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath58 is error free , then it is guaranteed that one of @xmath59 is the true random bits sequence . at this stage",
    ", we can say @xmath60 .",
    "so it is information - theoretically secure . here , if there is one bit error in @xmath58 by some reasons , then eve has @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is error sequence .",
    "the position of the error is unknown and uniformly distributed .",
    "when eve applies @xmath50 , @xmath51 to @xmath61 , then it is not guaranteed that the true @xmath49 exists in @xmath59 . since eve does not know the true random bits sequence , she has to try @xmath63 greater than the initial one in the sense of exponential .",
    "if there are many error , then it becomes @xmath64 .",
    "so one may obtain eq(6 ) .",
    "since y-00 is a physical cryptography , we should clarify the physical nature .",
    "let us discuss a property of physical system of @xmath2-ary psk coding scheme as a physical cryptography .",
    "in general , phase spaces of alice - bob and alice - eve are not same . the phase space is formed by the relative phase based on local phases of bob and eve .",
    "for example , quadrature amplitudes are @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the eq(9 ) is defined for the phase space of alice - bob .",
    "they assumed that eve has the same phase space with that of alice - bob .",
    "in general eve does not know the correct phase space . because , the channel for alice and bob has synchronization , but the channel between alice and eve does not have the same synchronization .",
    "this fact is one of characters of physical cryptography .",
    "so eve never understands what is the axis decided by herself , and she never knows what kinds of @xmath67 should be used . as a result , @xmath59 involves many errors , even when the measurement itself of @xmath34 is noiseless . since obtained data are random number , she has no way to know which bits are incorrect . if the period of the pseudo random number is @xmath25 as in the case of a maximum length linear feedback shift register , then the number of possibilities is @xmath64 which is greater than @xmath25 .    also the above physical situation provides information - theoretic security for known plaintext attack based on their attack",
    "of course , if one uses dsr(deliberate signal randomization ) discussed in the next subsection , then more effectively the security is proved .",
    "for the key generation , the original paper did not claim . but",
    "nishioka et al made a new model as follows : eve does not assign @xmath50 , @xmath51 at the first stage , and they forge a new model so called one - time pad scheme used y-00 which was not totally mentioned in the original paper . in their model , they use the relations as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is ciphertext , @xmath70 is plaintext .",
    "the random number @xmath71 as the key disappears .",
    "eve can get @xmath69 and @xmath34 , but she does not know @xmath38 . at this second stage",
    ", eve tries to assign to the eq(9 ) all the different running keys in which the number of possibilities is @xmath25 . as a result",
    ", they claim that the security of y-00 is equivalent to that of classical stream cipher @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the output of the pseudo random number generator in stream cipher . however",
    ", this scheme does not work by the same reason as that for the first stage .",
    "for a general concept of quantum key generation , we will discuss in the section 4 .",
    "in general , one uses several randomizaions in conventional cryptography .",
    "we have randomizaion for the protection of y-00 for the above attack , even the system is noiseless .",
    "the dsr(deliberate signal randomization ) is one of the most effective method .",
    "although it is easy to show that the initial key advantage hides the basic axis of phase space(refer communication theory and [ 13 ] ) , here we dare to take a perfect synchronization of alice , bob , and eve at the initial stage of the protocol .",
    "then the system is completely noiseless classical one . since they insist that the system is regarded as classical when they measure indirect observable , they can use eq(9 ) .",
    "however , for such an attack scheme , we can use @xmath74 where @xmath75 is forced randomization which destroy the phase synchronization .",
    "this is one of dsr explained in the reference [ 6 ] .",
    "such a randomizations induces error for the measurement of @xmath58 and destroy the relation like eq(9 ) .",
    "so eve s access information from the measurement : @xmath58 is completely zero .",
    "that is , eve s trial becomes from @xmath76 to @xmath77 which means search trial for each bit in the sequence of length @xmath25 .    if eve has only attack such as eq(9 ) , then this classical y-00 for ciphertext only attack is already secure in the sense of eq(6 ) and it makes secure scheme(eq(8 ) ) for known plaintext attack even in the noiseless classical framework .",
    "so no quantum computer can break this scheme . as a result",
    "one can see that the attack used eq(9 ) has no gain even in the noiseless classical y-00 .",
    "again , this means that if eve has only such an attack , then we do not need a quantum scheme to achieve `` our purpose '' .      in the original experiment by kumar s group",
    ", they did not use the randomization for simplicity .",
    "even so , it will be secure for the above mentioned attack . in the framework of their claim ,",
    "let us show that the error of the measurement for @xmath34 is unavoidable , even if they have complete synchronization for phase space .",
    "the density operators of signal sets for up and down measurement are @xmath78 we calculated the quantum limit , which is the most rigorous lower bound of error probability , for this signal when the coherent state is mesoscopic and several hundreds of @xmath2 . as a result , the error is several percents : @xmath79 .",
    "this means that the number of error bits is @xmath80 which is enough for protect against the proposed attack with brute force attack .",
    "in addition , in the system of northwestern university , @xmath2 is over 2000 .",
    "so if one does not know the running key , the measurement of @xmath47 would involve errors for a bundle of states close to selected axis by eve .",
    "since the basis state of alice is chosen randomly and uniformly on the circle of phase space , the error bits of the measurement sequence @xmath58 will be distributed uniformly .",
    "the security based on search is strongly enhanced even in their model .",
    "thus the attack based on indirect measurement can not overcome the security for direct measurement based on quantum detection theory[10 ] .",
    "however , before we discuss quantum effect , rather their attack is broken by classical randomization et al ..",
    "let us remind that if eve wants to make a situation @xmath81 eve has to get complete information for the sequence by measurements , not for @xmath34 .",
    "nishioka et al do not mention the concrete measurement process they use .",
    "this is very strange and their second mistake . if they want to use compound relative of the measurement for the data and eq(9 ) , then they should show how to measure it . for any cases ,",
    "the accuracy of eve s measurement is bounded by quantum detection theory . in the previous section",
    ", we focused on only the attack scheme given by nishioka et al .",
    "there is more general description of the security of y-00 independent of any concrete attacks , based on quantum detection theory . in the following , we introduce the general one .",
    "if eve wants to know some information on the data bits , she has to measure the signals by any instrument . in y-00 of the original model ,",
    "the problem of the measurement ability reduces to the comparison with optimum binary quantum measurement and optimum phase measurement . since eve",
    "does not know @xmath23 , she needs to make the phase measurement in order to identify @xmath21 for all possible basis selection from the running key . according to the quantum detection theory ,",
    "when eve and bob have the ultimate ability(ultimate receiver devices , and so on ) , their error probabilities may be shown that[6 ] @xmath82 where @xmath83 is signal energy .",
    "thus the error probability of bob is smaller than that of eve .",
    "this fact gives an advantage distillation , so it leads to information - theoretic security and key generation even one does not need to use any randomizations .",
    "that is , eq(8 ) holds .    on the other hand ,",
    "the randomizations provide more efficient scheme , as an example , @xmath84 where @xmath85 or reasonable value with dsr for @xmath86 .",
    "the above explanations , in principle , beat off a comment such that y-00 corresponds to classical cryptography .",
    "we clarified that the criticism of yuen protocol by t.nishioka , t.hasegawa , h.ishizuka , k.imafuku , and h.imai is wrong , and the attack does not say anything for y-00 . however , the security of y-00 is a different problem .",
    "but one can see reference [ 6 ] and subsequent papers for general theory .",
    "the author s group is concerned with how to realize y-00 with ultimate security by intensity modulation / direct detection optical communication system as discussed in [ 11,12 ] .",
