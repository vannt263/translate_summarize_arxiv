    "heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) has arguably been the fastest growing sector of elementary particle theory in the four years since its introduction  @xcite .",
    "this can be ascribed to two features : on one hand the spin and flavor symmetries are phenomenologically successful  @xcite and , on the other hand , corrections to the symmetry limit  @xmath0 are well defined and therefore calculable . given this state of affairs",
    ", it seems appropriate to investigate the theoretical formalism of hqeft in all orders of the combined  @xmath1 , @xmath2 expansion .",
    "it is only a slight exaggeration that quantum field theory ( qft ) has no physical content and is just the most powerful tool known for the calculation of  @xmath3-matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the fields and the off - shell values of their green s functions are not observable and therefore all qfts which lead to identical  @xmath3-matrices are physically equivalent .",
    "we are therefore free to choose the calculationally most convenient set of fields  @xcite , similar to the choice of appropriate coordinates in classical physics .",
    "this observation has borne the extremely powerful concept of effective field theory  ( eft )  @xcite which underlies almost all phenomenologically successful applications of qft .",
    "it is however far from obvious how the general theorems  @xcite guaranteeing the independence of the  @xmath3-matrix from the choice of interpolating fields translate to the intricate formalism of renormalized perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the so - called equivalence theorem , which formalizes this independence , has been proved rigorously  @xcite , using the renormalized quantum action principles  @xcite .",
    "we shall extend this proof to hqeft below .    in order to avoid any misconceptions",
    ", we should stress that the ( colored ) heavy quark fields  @xmath4 , @xmath5 of hqeft are _ not _ interpolating fields for  @xmath3-matrix elements in non - perturbative qcd .",
    "this rle is played by the meson and baryon fields .",
    "however , it seems instructive to define the @xmath3-matrix for free quarks as an intermediate step in order to show how the equivalence theorem works in a perturbative calculation .",
    "this note is organized as follows : to fix our notation and to introduce the technical subtleties of higher order calculations , we briefly describe hqeft in section  [ sec : hqeft ] .",
    "the quantum action principles are introduced in section  [ sec : qap ] .",
    "we sketch the proof of the equivalence theorems for green s functions and  @xmath3-matrix elements in sections  [ sec : et4gf ] and  [ sec : et4sm ] , respectively . as an application",
    ", we discuss the reparametrization invariance of hqeft in section  [ sec : reparam ] and clarify the rle of the classical equations of motion in section  [ sec : eom ] . finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] and describe why hqeft is more subtle than the quantum mechanical foldy - wouthuysen transformation .",
    "within the framework of perturbation theory , the heavy mass expansion is constructed by performing the following steps on the green s functions , i.e. , feynman diagrams of qcd : heavy quark loops are integrated out and replaced by their expansion around vanishing momenta entering the loop .",
    "the momenta of the remaining heavy quark propagators ( those connected to external heavy quark lines ) are replaced by the residual momenta  @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , with  @xmath9 the pole mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the antiparticle pole is eliminated by expanding the denominators around  @xmath10 : @xmath11    although this procedure is legitimate for tree level amplitudes and for the regularized loop diagrams , the different high energy behaviour of the propagators @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 in general destroys the equality of the full and effective theory amplitudes after renormalization .",
    "one has to correct for this by introducing matching contributions into the effective theory .",
    "this amounts to calculating the differences of the full and effective theory amplitudes for any amputated one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) diagram of the full theory and absorb them into a set of local operator insertions in the effective theory .",
    "the matching works here order by order in the loop expansion because the subtraction of the expansion about zero residual momentum @xmath14 improves the infrared  ( ir ) behavior of the integrands , exactly in such a way as to render the corrections ir convergent @xcite .",
    "note that it is essential for @xmath15 to be timelike for this to happen .    a tree level , the above procedure may be carried out in the functional integral of qcd by integrating over the lower components of the heavy quark field with respect to @xmath15 and thus constructing an effective field theory ( hqeft ) .",
    "the result @xcite @xmath16 containing the transverse derivative @xmath17 is expressed in terms of the upper component field @xmath18\\ ] ] and the sources of upper and lower components @xmath19 the latter are not needed for deriving @xmath3-matrix elements , but one might find it convenient to retain them in order to easily obtain the effective theory analogues of operator insertions .",
    "matching contributions enter in the same way as the tree - level quark - gluon vertex , so they can by included into ( [ l - tree ] ) by introducing a generalized covariant derivative @xcite @xmath20 with projections @xmath21 the effective lagrangian which generalizes ( [ l - tree ] ) is @xmath22 where  @xmath23 summarizes operators consisting only of light fields which are introduced by integrating out heavy quark loops in the full theory .",
    "this effective lagrangian is valid to arbitrary ( but finite ) order in the @xmath24 and loop expansions .",
    "one can easily reformulate hqeft with an arbitrary residual mass @xmath25 of the order @xmath26",

    "( e.g.  bphz  @xcite ) there are ( calculable ) normal product corrections  @xcite .",
    "since dimensional regularization is defined with the help of the schwinger parameter representation , which is also convenient for practical calculations , we define the parameter representation for diagrams containing heavy particles :    any internal light line @xmath38 is assigned a parameter @xmath39 and an auxiliary vector @xmath40 .",

    "the generalization to the multiparticle sector is straightforward if the velocities of the heavy particles do not coincide .",
    "here we shall _ not _ present a proof of theorem i of  @xcite , i.e.  the consistency of dimensional renormalization for hqeft in the parametric representation .",
    "we do not expect a failure of a translation of the proof in  @xcite , and we hope to come back to the purely technical details of such a proof in a later publication .    in order to establish the first qap ( [ eq : qap1 ] ) in hqeft , we have to specify the separation of the lagrangian @xmath52 into the free ( @xmath53 ) and interaction ( @xmath54 ) parts .",

    "we insist that the field variations be linear in the heavy quark field .    in diagrammatic language",

    "reparametrizations are as well possible in the full theory , if the additional terms introduced in the qcd lagrangian are treated perturbatively . since the effective theory may be constructed also from the reparametrized lagrangian by calculating the appropriate matching corrections , we have the following situation : the equivalence theorem in the full _ and _ effective theories , respectively , guarantees that the matching contributions do not depend on in which theory reparametrizations are carried out , if we use dimensional renormalization in both cases . in ordinary field theory one usually considers only field redefinitions that are relativistically invariant @xmath135 such redefinitions may be mirrored in the effective theory ; we observe that they preserve the luke - manohar reparametrization invariance of the effective lagrangian .",

    ", the equivalence theorem serves as a guideline how the classical equations of motion manifest themselves once radiative corrections and renormalization are taken into account .    from our discussion",
    "it should have become clear that  unless one is willing to handle normal product corrections  it is necessary to use a ms - like renormalization scheme , and to make sure that the free lagrangian ( i.e. , the propagator ) is not affected . in particular",
    ", this applies to attempts to derive the heavy quark lagrangian employing the foldy - wouthuysen transformation familiar from single - particle quantum mechanics @xcite . by its very nature",
    "this transformation modifies the quark propagator in the full theory and thus violates the hypothesis of the equivalence theorem .",
    "since the authors of  @xcite do not discuss how to calculate the necessary normal product corrections , the argument given in @xcite is not a complete derivation of hqeft . on the other hand ,",
    "the lagrangian provided in  @xcite can be reduced to the tree - level lagrangian  ( [ l - tree ] ) by a series of field redefinitions which are compatible with the equivalence theorem of the _ effective _ theory - matrix elements in the full theory  ( [ lsz - ft ] , [ lsz - b ] ) as well as in he effective theory  ( [ lsz - eft ] , [ lsz - b - eff ] ) . ] .",
    "thus beyond tree - level the foldy - wouthuysen approach can _ only _ be justified if it is amended by some prescription to calculate matching corrections , which will then yield the same results as the conventional approach  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the form of the hqeft lagrangian is by no means unique , but as long as a ms - like renormalization scheme is used , different versions can be mapped onto each other by perturbative field redefinitions . however , in any renormalization scheme where the qaps hold in the weak sense only ( i.e. , normal product corrections arise ) , one has to perform a new matching calculation if one wants to carry out reparametrizations . in particular , in a general scheme the classical equations of motion can not be naively applied , and reparametrization invariance is lost beyond leading order in the @xmath136 and @xmath24 expansions .    10",
