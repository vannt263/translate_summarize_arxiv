    "the total masses and sizes of all galaxies are poorly determined quantities   because we do not have suitable dynamical tracers at sufficiently large radii .",
    "the accurate measurement of the mass profile provides important clues to the nature of the dark matter .",
    "the milky way is the prime target for an accurate measurement .",
    "wilkinson & evans ( 1999 , hereafter we99 ) calculate the total mass of the milky way to be @xmath3 , using the full set of 27 known satellite galaxies and globular clusters ( hereafter satellites ) at galactocentric radii @xmath4 20 kpc ( six possess measured proper motions ) .",
    "the large errors are primarily a consequence of the small number of satellites",
    ". the sample must be nearly complete , so a new population of distant halo objects must be found in order to increase the number of dynamical tracers .",
    "this motivates a new survey for remote halo tracers at large galactocentric distances .",
    "we have solved the problem of how to find large numbers of bhb stars in the remote halo , and have begun a vlt programme to measure the kinematics of the population .",
    "the procedure involves three steps .",
    "first , we use u*g*r * photometry from the sdss database to detect a - type stars at high - galactic latitude .",
    "these stars are either bhb stars ( @xmath6 = 0.7 , luminous standard candles ) or blue stragglers which are @xmath7 2 mag . less luminous .",
    "second , we reduce the number of blue stragglers and increase the probability of good classification by limiting the colour ranges to 1.4 @xmath8 1.1 and -0.04 @xmath9 -0.2 . finally , using spectroscopy , described in clewley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we are able to efficiently separate the two populations . we consistently find that about half of our target a - type stars are bhb stars .",
    "figure 1 ( middle ) shows the increase of distant halo tracers at galactocentric distances of 20 @xmath10 130 kpc from 23 ( left ) to 90 .",
    "preliminary results from the vlt are extremely encouraging",
    ". we have successfully isolated 16 bhb stars in the galactocentric distance range of 70 to 130 kpc from a target sample of 31 candidates . with this small programme",
    "we have nearly doubled the number of tracers known at @xmath11kpc . combined with the 23 satellites and 51 bhb stars at distances 20 to 60 kpc ( from previous work at the aat and wht )",
    "we find the mass of the milky way is @xmath12 .",
