    "it is largely accepted that quantum mutual information is a measure of the total correlation contained in a bipartite quantum state @xcite , but an outstanding question is how to distinguish between the quantum and the classical aspects of the total correlation . in view of the distinct nature of the correlations ( quantum and classical ) , it is reasonable to assume that they add in a simple way so that quantum mutual information is the sum of the quantum and the classical correlations @xcite .    to quantify the quantumness of the correlation contained in a bipartite quantum state olliver and",
    "zurek @xcite proposed a measure for quantum correlation known as quantum discord and based on a distinction between qit and classical information theory ( cit ) .",
    "a related quantity concerning classical correlation was proposed by henderson and vedral @xcite . a recent result that almost all quantum states have a nonvanishing quantum discord @xcite shows up the relevance of studying such correlation .    at the core of the previous quantifiers of correlations",
    "is the one - partition ( one - side ) measurement on a bipartite system .",
    "thus , in a general case , those quantifiers may be asymmetric with respect to the choice of subsystem to be measured .",
    "a symmetrical quantifier of classical correlation based on measurement over both partitions of a bipartite system was proposed in ref .",
    "it was assumed that the classical correlation is quantified by the maximum classical mutual information obtained by local measurements over the two partitions of the system .",
    "an important point about these measures of correlations is related to their computation .",
    "these measures are based on extremization procedures over all possible measurements that can be performed on the subsystems and thus constitute a difficult problem even numerically .",
    "actually , analytical solutions for the quantum discord were obtained recently for a certain class of highly symmetrical states @xcite .",
    "hence , an alternative , operational ( without any extremization procedure ) quantifier is rather desirable .",
    "one approach , also based on the disturbance that a measurement causes in the system , was used in ref .",

    "it was found that , while a certain quantity related to the work that can be extracted from the environment using a bipartite state is nonzero for all entangled states , it also need not vanish for separable ones , being therefore a measure of quantum correlation .",
    "besides the characterization and quantification of classical and quantum correlations , another important problem is the behavior of these correlations under the action of decoherence .",
    "this phenomenon , mainly caused by the injection of noise into the system and arising from its inevitable interaction with the surrounding environment , is responsible for the loss of quantum coherence initially present in the system .",
    "recently it was noted @xcite that , for a certain class of states under markovian dynamics , the quantum discord only vanishes at asymptotic time , contrary to what happens to entanglement , which can disappear at finite times @xcite .",
    "these results show that the quantumness of correlation is more resistant to the action of the environment than the entanglement itself .",
    "although quantum discord under decoherence does not exhibit sudden death , its dynamics may be very peculiar , exhibiting sudden changes in behavior @xcite .",
    "studying how decoherence affects the correlations in a two - qubit composite system , maziero and coworkers @xcite recently proposed an operational measure to quantify both classical and quantum correlations .",
    "this result rests on the surprising fact that , for a suitable choice of the noise channel , the classical correlation is not affected by the decoherence process , while the quantum correlation is completely destroyed . thus , the classical correlation may be given by the quantum mutual information at asymptotic time @xcite .    in this article",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of system - reservoir correlations under decoherence .",
    "we consider a noninteracting two - qubit system under the influence of two independent environments .",
    "the most common noise channels ( amplitude damping , phase damping , bit flip , bit - phase flip , and phase flip ) are studied . by analytical and numerical analysis",
    "we find that , contrary to what is usually stated in the literature , decoherence may occur without entanglement between the system and the environment .",
    "we also show that , in some cases , the bipartite quantum correlation initially present in the system is completely evaporated and not transferred to the environments , as can occur for entanglement under amplitude damping as reported in ref .",
