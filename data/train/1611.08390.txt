    "since the discovery of graphene in 2004 ,  @xcite its application to nanoelectronic devices has been regarded as one of the most significant tasks in the field of nanotechnology sciences . however , the absence of a band gap in graphene restricts its utilization as a channel material in field - effect transistors .",
    "so far , many efforts have been devoted to open a band gap in graphene .",
    "@xcite specifically , the chemical modification approach with adatoms  @xcite has been intensively employed for the gap opening of graphene .",
    "for instance , fluorinated graphene ( hereafter termed f - graphene ) has been attracted much attention as a promising material for nanoelectronic device applications because of its tunable band gap with respect to the amount of fluorination and the fluorination patterns .",
    "@xcite in order to design the structure of f - graphene in atomic scale , it is necessary to understand the diffusion and adsorption of the f atom on graphene .",
    "it was found that the f atom prefers to adsorb on the on - top site of graphene with a single f@xmath0c bond .",
    "@xcite recently , sadeghi @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite reported a first - principles density - functional theory ( dft ) study of the f diffusion both on monolayer ( ml ) graphene and between the layers of bilayer ( bl ) graphene , showing a drastic difference between the two cases : i.e. , the mobility of the f atom within bl graphene increases by about an order of magnitude compared to that on ml graphene .",
    "although sadeghi @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite predicted a facilitated diffusion process of the f atom within bl graphene by hopping from one layer to the other layer , the microscopic underlying mechanism of the drastic difference of f diffusion between ml and bl graphenes is still lacking .",
    "as another chemical modification of graphene , oxidized graphene ( hereafter termed o - graphene ) has been widely adopted because of its low cost and manufacturing feasibility for mass production of graphene or graphene nano - platelets .",
    "@xcite in particular , o - graphene which can be generated from graphite oxide contains various o - containing functional groups , thereby offering a broad applicability to electronic devices .",
    "it is noted that the o atom adsorbs on the bridge site of graphene with the c@xmath0o@xmath0c bond ,  @xcite which is different from the on - top adsorption site of hydrogen , halogen , and f atoms .",
    "@xcite this different binding of o with graphene may cause a distinctive diffusion behavior compared to the above - mentioned f diffusion . indeed , earlier dft calculations  @xcite reported that the energy barrier for the o diffusion on ml graphene ranges between 0.73 and 0.81 ev , which is relatively larger than that ( ranging between 0.13 and 0.29 ev ) for the f diffusion on ml graphene .",
    "@xcite however , a comparative study of the o diffusions on ml graphene and within bl graphene is yet to be explored .        in this paper , we perform a first - principles theoretical study of the diffusion behaviors of the o and f adatoms both on ml graphene and between the layers of bl graphene by using a van der waals ( vdw ) energy - corrected dft calculation .  @xcite our calculated potential energy surfaces ( pess ) for such ml and bl o(f)-graphene systems show that ( i ) the diffusion barrier @xmath3 for o ( f ) on ml graphene is 0.81 ( 0.30 ) ev , and ( ii ) @xmath3 for o ( f ) within bl graphene increases ( decreases ) to 0.85 ( 0.18 ) ev .",
    "such contrasting variations of the o and f diffusions between ml and bl graphenes can be associated with their different bonding natures : i.e. , the o adatom has a strongly covalent c@xmath0o@xmath0c bonding on the bridge site of the c@xmath0c bond , while the f atom has a weakly ionic f@xmath0c bonding on top of a c atom .",
    "consequently , the o atom diffuses on one graphene layer with a slight interference of the other layer , while the f atom easily diffuses by hopping between two graphene layers with accepting more electron charges from the two layers .",
    "our findings shed more light on understanding the contrasting diffusion behaviors of the o and f atoms on ml graphene and within bl graphene .",
    "our first - principles dft calculations were performed using an accurate all - electron , full - potential scheme with numeric atom - centered orbital basis functions , as implemented in the fritz - haber - institute @xmath4 @xmath5 molecular simulations ( fhi - aims ) package .",
    "@xcite all the calculations were carried out with `` tight '' computational settings and accurate tier-2 basis sets . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functional of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite",
    "was employed for the exchange - correlation energy . to include the effects of vdw interactions",
    ", we used the pbe+vdw scheme developed by tkatchenko and scheffler ,  @xcite which has been demonstrated to be accurate in layered crystals as well as various adsorbates on surfaces .",
    "@xcite the o - graphene or f - graphene system was simulated by containing one o or f atom within a @xmath6@xmath7@xmath6 unit cell , thereby minimizing the spurious interactions between o or f adatoms in the periodic unit cells .",
    "the * k*-space integration was done with the 12@xmath712 uniform meshes in the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "all atoms were allowed to fully relax until all the residual force components on each atom were less than 0.01 ev /  . using the pbe ( pbe+vdw ) calculation ,",
    "the lattice constant of ml graphene and the interlayer distance of bl graphene were obtained as 2.47 ( 2.46 ) and 4.06 ( 3.24 )  , respectively .",
    ".calculated pbe binding energies ( @xmath8 ) of the o - graphene and f - graphene systems , together with the pbe+vdw results in parentheses^_a_^ [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]      + ^_a_^ for the definitions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , see figure 1 .    due to the interlayer vdw interactions in bl graphene",
    ", the geometries and binding energies of the bl o - graphene and bl f - graphene systems are expected to be different between the pbe and pbe+vdw results . to examine these differecnes",
    ", we perform the pbe+vdw calculation for various adsorption sites .",
    "figure 1a - d show the most stable structures of ml o - graphene , ml f - graphene , bl o - graphene , and bl f - graphene , respectively , obtained using the pbe+vdw calculation .",
    "the calculated binding energies of these o - graphene and f - graphene systems are also listed in table 1 .",
    "we find that the most stable b site for ml or bl o - graphene and t ( th ) site for ml ( bl ) f - garphene are invariant between the pbe and pbe+vdw calculations .",
    "however , the inclusion of vdw interactions in ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene slightly increases @xmath8 by 0.06 and 0.07 ev , respectively . on the other hand , such vdw effects in bl o - graphene and bl f - graphene decrease @xmath8 as large as 0.49 and 0.84 ev , respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this huge vdw - induced reduction of binding energy in bl o - graphene and bl f - graphene is caused by the fact that the inclusion of vdw interactions produces the large lattice deformation of bl graphene .",
    "as shown in table 2 , for ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene , the pbe and pbe+vdw calculations hardly change the bond lengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , the pbe+vdw geometry of bl o(f)-graphene shows a dramatic decrease in the interlayer distance @xmath10 by 0.74 ( 1.20 )  compared to the corresponding values obtained using pbe ( see table 2 ) .",
    "consequently , the pbe+vdw calculations for bl o - graphene and bl f - graphene give rise to a significant structural deformation of the upper graphene layer around o and f adatoms [ see figure 1c , d ] , thereby leading to a decrease in their binding energies compared to those computed from pbe . in these respects , we can say that vdw interactions play an important role in determining the geometries and binding energies of bl o - graphene and bl f - graphene .",
    "next , we investigate the diffusions of o and f atoms on ml graphene using the pbe+vdw scheme . to obtain the minimum - energy diffusion pathway , we calculate the pess for ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene by optimizing the structure at the uniformly separated adsorption sites within the graphene unit cell .",
    "figure 2a , b ) show the calculated pess for ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene , respectively .",
    "we find that , for ml o - graphene , the o adatom has a diffusion path from the b site to the neighboring b site through the t@xmath13 ( close to t ) site with @xmath3 = 0.81 ev , in good agreement with a previous dft result  @xcite where the transition state is slightly deviated from the t site with @xmath3 = 0.73 ev . here , the present angles of the c@xmath0c@xmath0o bonds at the t@xmath13 site are 101.5@xmath14 , 102.5@xmath14 , and 106.3@xmath14 ( see figure s1 of the supporting information ) , close to those ( 99.9@xmath14 , 101.0@xmath14 , and 108.1@xmath14 ) of a previous dft calculation .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , for ml f - graphene , the f adatom diffuses from the t site to the neighboring t site through the b site with @xmath3 = 0.30 ev , in good agreement with that ( 0.29 ev ) of previous dft calculations .",
    "@xcite thus , @xmath3 for the o diffusion of ml o - graphene is @xmath152.5 times larger than that for the f diffusion of ml f - graphene , indicating that the f atom can diffuse much faster than the o atom .        to understand the contrasting diffusion behaviors of the o and f atoms between ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene",
    ", we examine the bonding natures of the o and f adatoms on ml graphene .",
    "figure 3a , b display the charge density difference calculated from ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene , respectively , which is defined as @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the charge density of o - graphene or f - graphene and @xmath18+@xmath19 is the superposition of the charge densities of the separated systems , i.e. , isolated o or f atom and clean graphene . in figure 3a , @xmath20 of ml o - graphene represents a covalent bonding character for the c@xmath0o@xmath0c bond with @xmath11 = 1.46  . along the diffusion path b@xmath21t@xmath13@xmath21b",
    ", one o@xmath0c bond is broken while the other o@xmath0c bond is shortened to be @xmath11 = 1.41  at the transition site . meanwhile , as shown in figure 3b , @xmath20 of ml f - graphene represents an ionic bonding character for the f@xmath0c bond with @xmath12 = 1.54  . note that f has a relatively larger electronegativity of 3.98 compared to that ( 2.55 ) of c.  @xcite",
    "this ionic f@xmath0c bond character for an isolated f adatom on graphene is consistent with a recent combined dft and x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy study .",
    "@xcite interestingly , the f atom at the transition state ( equivalently at the b site ) along the diffusion path t@xmath21b@xmath21 t is far away from two neighboring c atoms with @xmath12 = 2.29  .",
    "this longer separation between the f and c atoms at the transition state is drastically different from a decrease of @xmath11 at the transition state of ml o - graphene , reflecting the different bonding natures between ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene .",
    "as shown in the right panels of figure 3a , b , @xmath20 for the transition states of ml o - graphene and ml f - graphene clearly show the covalent and ionic bonding characters , respectively .    we continue to investigate the diffusion of the o and f atoms between the layers of bl graphene using the pbe+vdw scheme .",
    "figure 2c , d display the calculated pess for bl o - graphene and bl f - graphene , respectively .",
    "we find that the o atom in bl o - graphene is covalently bound to one graphene layer during the diffusion process .",
    "compared with the result for ml o - graphene , the o diffusion in bl o - graphene is somewhat influenced by the presence of the other layer . for bl o - graphene , there are the two different diffusion paths i and ii with @xmath3 = 0.85 and 0.86 ev , respectively , which is slightly larger than ( 0.81 ev ) in ml o - graphene . here , the path i",
    "( ii ) has the transition state passing the tt ( th ) site [ see figure 2c ] .",
    "note that the hopping of the o atom from one layer to the other layer has a high energy barrier of @xmath221.3 ev .",
    "by contrast , the pes for bl f - graphene shows that the f atom easily diffuses by hopping from one layer to the other layer : see figure 2d .",
    "we find that the diffusion path along th@xmath21b@xmath21tt@xmath21b@xmath21ht involves double barriers with @xmath3 = 0.18 ev [ see figure 2f ] .",
    "this value in bl f - graphene is much reduced compared to that ( 0.30 ev ) in ml f - graphene , indicating that the diffusion of f is facilitated within bl graphene .",
    "these contrasting diffusion behaviors of o and f between bl o - graphene and bl f - graphene can be also traced to their different bonding natures , as discussed below .     of ( a )",
    "ml o - graphene , ( b ) ml f - graphene , ( c ) bl o - graphene , and ( d ) bl f - graphene .",
    "the left ( right ) panels represent the results at the equilibrium ( transition ) state . in the contour plots ,",
    "the first solid ( dashed ) lines are drawn at 5.0@xmath710@xmath23 @xmath24/@xmath25 ( @xmath05.0@xmath710@xmath23 @xmath24/@xmath25 ) and the contour spacing is 3.3@xmath710@xmath23 @xmath24/@xmath25 ( @xmath03.3@xmath710@xmath23 @xmath24/@xmath25 ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines indicate accumulated and depleted electrons , respectively .",
    "the numbers represent the bond lengths ( in  ) . ]",
    "as shown in figure 3a , c , the values of @xmath11 at the equilibrium and transition states of bl o - graphene are similar to those in ml o - graphene , implying that o adsorption on one layer is little affected by the other layer . such small changes of the geometries of ml o - graphene and bl o - graphene is consistent with their similarity of @xmath20 : see figure 3a , c . these results in turn give the slight change in @xmath3 between ml o - graphene and bl o - graphene . on the other hand , @xmath12 at the transition state of bl f - graphene becomes 2.16 or 2.17  , much shorter than that ( 2.29  ) in ml f - graphene : see the right panels of figure 3b , d .",
    "this decrease of @xmath12 in bl f - graphene can be associated with more ionic character due to its enhanced charge transfer : i.e. , the f adatom in bl f - graphene accepts more electrons simultaneously from the two layers compared to ml f - graphene , as shown in figure 3b , d .",
    "such more charge accumulation around the f atom is likely to increase the binding energy due to an ionic bonding to its neighboring c atoms , leading to a decrease of @xmath3 in bl f - graphene .",
    "it is finally worth noting that the adsorption of alkali and transition metal elements on graphene occurs at the h site , forming strong chemical bonds with surrounding c atoms .",
    "@xcite such strong bindings on graphene can not be expected to an easy diffusion .",
    "indeed , some transition metal elements favoring adsorption on the h site showed relatively larger diffusion barriers compared to other elements favoring adsorption on the b or t site  @xcite .",
    "it is thus likely that the initial adsorption structure of adatoms on graphene plays a crucial role in determining their diffusion behaviors .",
    "we have presented a first - principles theoretical study of the diffusion behaviors of the o and f adatoms both on ml graphene and between the layers of bl graphene .",
    "our calculated potential energy surfaces for the o - graphene and f - graphene systems showed that the diffusion barrier for the o atom slightly increases from 0.81 ev on graphene to 0.85 ev within bilayer graphene , while that for the f atom significantly decreases from 0.30 ev on graphene to 0.18 ev within bilayer graphene .",
    "it is revealed that such contrasting variations of the o and f diffusions between ml and bl graphenes are attributed to their different bonding natures : i.e. , the o adatom that has a strongly covalent c@xmath0o@xmath0c bonding on the bridge site of the c@xmath0c bond diffuses on one graphene layer with a slight interference of the other layer , while the f adatom that has a weakly ionic f@xmath0c bonding on top of a c atom easily diffuses by hopping between two graphene layers with accepting more electron charges from the two layers .",
    "our findings shed more light on understanding the contrasting diffusion behaviors of the o and f atoms on ml graphene and within bl graphene , which will provide a useful information for the chemical modification of graphene sheets .",
