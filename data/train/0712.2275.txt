    "recent developments of radioactive isotope accelerators enable the investigation of fusion reactions that form heavy elements in the cosmos .",
    "these involve reactions of nuclei far from stability .",
    "the most exotic of these are often very weakly bound .",
    "breakup of weakly bound nuclei is an important process in their reactions with other nuclei .",
    "a major consequence of breakup is that not all the resulting breakup fragments might be captured by the target , termed incomplete fusion ( icf ) ; capture of the entire projectile by the target is called complete fusion ( cf ) .",
    "such icf processes can dramatically change the nature of the reaction products , as has been investigated in detail for the stable weakly - bound nuclei @xmath0be and @xmath1li @xcite .",
    "there , at energies above the fusion barrier , cf yields were found to be only @xmath2 of those expected , the remaining @xmath3 being in icf products .",
    "events where the projectile breaks up and none of the fragments are captured provide an important diagnostic of the reaction dynamics .",
    "this we call no - capture breakup ( ncbu ) , which is expected to be predominant at energies below the fusion barrier .",
    "the modelling of all these reaction processes within the same theoretical framework is an outstanding problem .",
    "the continuum - discretised - coupled - channels ( cdcc ) quantum mechanical model can make reliable predictions of the ncbu process , but can not distinguish between icf and cf processes unambiguously @xcite .",
    "an alternative for solving this problem is the development of classical dynamical approaches based on the concept of classical trajectories , which are being successfully applied to describe atomic many - body collisions , including ionization @xcite , a process in some ways analogous to breakup .    in this paper",
    ", we present a program of the classical trajectory model with stochastic breakup , recently published by the author et al . in ref . @xcite .",
    "since the code could be very useful for many researchers involved in near - barrier experiments of fusion and breakup with weakly - bound/ radioactive nuclei , it will be beneficial make the program accessible to everyone . in section 2 ,",
    "a description of the model is given to make the paper self - contained , whilst in section 3 the program and the input file are explained .",
    "the code is illustrated in section 4 with the reaction of a pseudo-@xmath4be projectile @xmath5 ( assuming a weakly - bound state of two @xmath6-particles ) with a @xmath7pb target .",
    "for this test case , the good agreement of the classical model calculations for the ncbu process with those of the cdcc quantum mechanical model shows the reliability of the classical approach ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the weakly bound ( two - body ) projectile @xmath5 , with incident energy @xmath8 and orbital angular momentum @xmath9 , is incident on the target @xmath10 , initially at rest in the laboratory frame .",
    "prior to breakup the projectile follows a classical orbit , which is characterised by a @xmath5-@xmath10 distance of closest approach @xmath11 .",
    "these orbits of the bound projectile are calculated by numerical solution of the newtonian equations of motion in the presence of the coulomb and nuclear potentials between @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "these generate a fusion barrier for head - on ( @xmath12 ) collisions having a height @xmath13 at an internuclear distance @xmath14 .",
    "the coulomb and nuclear two - body interactions that cause breakup are empirically encoded in a density of ( local breakup ) probability @xmath15 , which is a function only of the projectile - target separation @xmath16 .",
    "it is defined such that @xmath17 is the probability of breakup in the interval @xmath16 to @xmath18 .",
    "a key feature that must be emphasised is that for a given projectile - target combination , both experimental data @xcite and cdcc calculations indicate that the integral of this breakup probability along a given classical orbit is an exponential function of its distance of closest approach , @xmath11",
    ". explicitly ( see appendix a ) , @xmath19    it follows uniquely from this equation that the local breakup function has the same exponential form , @xmath20      the code then proceeds with a monte carlo approach to sample the initial conditions of breakup . for each @xmath9 ( chosen to be an integer number of @xmath21 ) a sample of @xmath22 incident projectiles",
    "the position of breakup on this orbit is determined by sampling a breakup radius @xmath23 in the interval @xmath24 $ ] with the weighting @xmath15 .",
    "although dependent on the constants @xmath25 and @xmath6 , the exponential weighting of @xmath15 will clearly place most @xmath23 in the vicinity of @xmath26 .",
    "if the chosen @xmath9 is less than the critical partial wave for projectile fusion , @xmath27 , then the associated trajectory would normally lead to cf , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "for these @xmath9 we set @xmath29 , when sampling @xmath23 , and all breakup events are confined to the incoming branch of the projectile trajectory . for @xmath30 breakup can take place on both the entrance and the exit branches of the classical orbit , which are sampled equally .",
    "having chosen the position with the projectile center of mass at breakup , it is instantaneously broken up into fragments f1 and f2 .    following breakup",
    ", the two fragments f1 and f2 interact with @xmath10 , and with each other , through real central two - body potentials having coulomb barriers @xmath31 at separations @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the instantaneous dynamical variables of the excited projectile at breakup , namely its total internal energy @xmath34 , its angular momentum @xmath35 and the separation of the fragments @xmath36 are all monte carlo sampled . the initial separations @xmath37 between the fragments are gaussian distributed in their classically allowed region .",
    "this mimics the radial probability distribution of the projectile ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "wave function . for high @xmath38 ,",
    "when there is no barrier between f1 and f2 , @xmath37 is taken as their external turning point . in the test calculation described below , the orientation of @xmath36 is chosen randomly over the @xmath39 solid angle , and the orientation of @xmath35 is chosen randomly from all directions orthogonal to @xmath36 .",
    "other distributions could be taken in cases where the two breakup fragments are not identical .",
    "@xmath38 is sampled uniformly in the interval [ 0,@xmath40 . for @xmath34 two sampling functions",
    "were tested ranging from the energy of the top of the barrier , @xmath41 , to a chosen maximum @xmath42 . using uniform weighting or an exponentially decreasing weighting yielded very similar outcomes .",
    "the convergence of the observables was faster for the latter case , which was therefore used .",
    "both @xmath43 and @xmath42 were increased until convergence of the observables occured , as in the cdcc calculations .",
    "having fixed the positions and dynamical variables of the excited projectile fragments at the moment of breakup , the instantaneous velocities of the particles f1 , f2 and @xmath10 are determined by conservation of energy , linear momentum and angular momentum in the overall center of mass frame of the projectile and target system ( see appendix b for details ) .",
    "these breakup initial conditions were transformed to the laboratory frame where the equations of motion are solved .",
    "the calculated trajectories of f1 , f2 and @xmath10 determine the number of icf , cf and ncbu events , fragment f@xmath44 being assumed to be captured if the classical trajectories take it within the fragment - target barrier radius @xmath45 .      from the @xmath22 breakup events sampled for each projectile angular momentum @xmath9 , the numbers of events @xmath46 in which @xmath47 0 ( ncbu ) , 1 ( icf ) , or 2 ( cf ) fragments are captured determine the relative yields @xmath48 of these three reaction processes after breakup , with @xmath49 .",

    "the cross sections are calculated using @xmath54 where @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 is the projectile mass .",
    "the other observables , such as the angle , kinetic energy and relative energy distributions of the fragments from ncbu events , are calculated by tracking their trajectories to a large distance from the target , which was 200 fm in the calculations given below .",
    "the code has a main program and eight modules .",
