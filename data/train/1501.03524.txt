    "in 1989 , roberts presented an interesting exact solution in general relativity with a massless scalar field  @xcite .",
    "this is a one - parameter family of dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions with spherical symmetry admitting a homothetic killing vector .",
    "an error of the expression has been corrected by several authors  @xcite and a missing class of solutions in the original parametrization was also given  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that , in the region where the derivative of the scalar field is timelike , this roberts solution is equivalent to the solution obtained by gutman and bespalko for a stiff fluid in 1967  @xcite .    the roberts solution has been intensively investigated in the context of gravitational collapse .",
    "the most fascinating feature of this solution is that the spacetime can be attached to the minkowski spacetime on a null hypersurface in a regular manner , namely , without a massive thin shell .",
    "then the resulting spacetime represents gravitational collapse from a regular initial datum . for this reason",
    ", the roberts solution has been studied as a toy model to understand critical phenomena in gravitational collapse  @xcite or wormhole formation  @xcite .    in this background , it is natural to seek the ( anti-)de  sitter ( ( a)ds ) generalization of the roberts solution , but it has been missing for a long time",
    ". such a solution may be useful to understand the nature or final fate of the nonlinear turbulent instability of the ads spacetime which was numerically found  @xcite .",
    "another possible application is the ads / cft duality  @xcite in the dynamical context .",
    "the field theory at the boundary for a dynamical asymptotically ads black hole should be in a non - equilibrium state and such a dynamical black hole has been constructed perturbatively as a holographic dual to the bjorken flow  @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is an exact solution in the presence of a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "it represents an asymptotically locally ads dynamical black hole with a homogeneous scalar field  @xcite .",
    "however , it does not admit a limit to the roberts solution .",
    "quite recently , roberts himself successfully obtained the ( a)ds generalization of his solution  @xcite .",
    "this spacetime is conformally related to the roberts spacetime and , interestingly , the configuration of the scalar field is totally the same as that in the solution without a cosmological constant .",
    "although this solution must have a variety of potentially interesting applications , only a few properties have been studied in  @xcite . especially , in order to know how useful it is , global structure of the spacetime must be clarified .    in this paper , we will present all the possible global structures of the roberts-(a)ds solution and its topological generalization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we summarize basic properties of the solution .",
