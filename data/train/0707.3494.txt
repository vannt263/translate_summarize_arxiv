    "the generic suppression of high-@xmath0 single inclusive hadron spectra  @xcite and triggered particle correlations  @xcite in collisions at rhic support this picture .",
    "these measurements can be largely accounted for in models of radiative parton energy loss  @xcite , which assume that additional medium - induced parton splitting leads to a softening of the parton shower , and thus to an energy degradation of the leading hadrons .",
    "if the leading hadronic fragment in a jet carries less energy , then - due to energy - momentum conservation - either the subleading fragments carry more , or their multiplicity increases accordingly .",
    "the resulting changes expected for the longitudinal  @xcite and transverse  @xcite jet energy and jet multiplicity distributions have been discussed in the context of models , which account successfully for the suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra . in this paper , we study a third class of jet characteristics , which may show significant medium effects : measurements of the hadrochemical composition of jet fragments .",
    "there are several reasons of why one expects parton energy loss to affect jet hadrochemistry .",
    "in particular , in all models of radiative parton energy loss @xcite , the interaction of a parent parton with the qcd medium transfers color between partonic projectile and target .",
    "this changes the color flow in the parton shower and is thus likely to affect hadronization . to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have sketched in fig .",

    "the color singlet prehadronic subsystems at the end of the perturbative evolution of the shower may be identified with the connected fermion lines in this diagram .",
    "[ fig1]b illustrates the conceivable effects of a single gluon exchange between the projectile gluon and a target quark in the medium .",
    "the multiplicity in the shower increases and the momentum distribution may soften and widen accordingly . also , in general , the color singlet prehadronic subsystems at the end of the perturbative evolution will have a different distribution in invariant mass .",
    "this makes it likely that their subsequent fragmentation into hadrons results in a hadrochemical distribution different from that of a gluon fragmenting in the vacuum .",
    "this model - dependent example illustrates that existing models of parton energy loss , though formulated in an entirely partonic language , contain one possible ingredient for a medium - induced modification of the hadrochemical composition of jets , namely : color exchange between projectile and target .",
    "in addition , flavor or baryon number could be exchanged between medium and projectile .",
    "for instance , subleading partons in the jet may be subject to hadronization via recombination with partons from the medium  @xcite , a mechanism which is conjectured to underlie baryon enhancement of identified single inclusive spectra at intermediate @xmath0 . if parton energy loss involves non - negligible recoil effects ( a.k.a .",
    "collisional energy loss  @xcite ) , then one may also speculate that the hard parton kicks components of the medium into the jet cone . depending on the quantum numbers carried by the components kicked , this will affect jet hadrochemistry . in short , medium - induced modifications of jet hadrochemistry",
    "are a direct ( for the case of color transfer ) or conceivable ( for the case of recombination , flavor and baryon number transfer ) consequences of the current models of jet quenching .",
    "they provide complementary information about the microscopic mechanism underlying parton energy loss .",
    "thus , jet hadrochemistry may be a valuable tool for establishing the properties of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions .",

    "this task is more complex for the case of a medium - modified jet , since it depends now additionally on information about the exchange of momentum , color , flavor and baryon number between the partonic projectile and the medium . in the present work",
    ", we shall largely bypass these complications .",
    "we merely observe that even if the exchange of quantum numbers between projectile and target is disregarded , a change of hadrochemical composition can be expected for the generic case that the distribution of partons in invariant mass is modified .",
    "it is a model of this type @xcite , which we introduce in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "since this model does not implement any of the effects mentioned above , it may be expected to underestimate the medium - modifications of jet hadrochemistry .",

    ", we discuss the hadrochemical composition of the high - multiplicity soft background , in which medium - modified jets are immersed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we emphasize that the hadrochemical composition of this background differs significantly from that of a proton - proton collision , and it also differs form the vacuum fragmentation of a jet . this difference in composition will help to characterize jet hadrochemistry in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",

    "rhic data indicate that a realistic prescription should lead to a softening of the jet distribution , consistent with a suppression of the leading hadron spectra by a factor @xmath51 in central au+au collisions .",

    "the use of @xmath62 as a fragmentation function for leading hadron production is thus unreliable .",

    "they decrease slightly with increasing jet energy , but remain clearly visible even for @xmath82 gev jets .",
    "the significant medium modification of jet hadrochemistry is remarkable , since the present model does not encode for medium effects at or after hadronization . also , in contrast to the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the model does not involve color transfer between projectile and target , nor does it involve the transfer of other quantum numbers .",
    "it only encodes an enhancement of the probability of parton splitting , which affects the distribution of the invariant mass of partons at the end of the parton shower .",
    "it is one of the main results of this paper , that enhanced parton splitting alone without explicit medium - induced modification of the hadronization mechanism can lead to significant changes in the jet hadrochemical composition . in this sense ,",
    "characteristic deviations in jet hadrochemistry are a generic characteristics of any parton energy loss mechanism , as long as medium - modified splitting is indispensable for parton energy loss .",
    "we have studied whether medium effects generally enhance the yield of heavier hadrons , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , or whether the opposite may be possible . in the context of mlla+lphd , we observe that the yield of heavier hadrons peaks at smaller values of @xmath49 and that increasing the splitting parameter @xmath58 enhances the soft part of this yield .",
    "however , the @xmath49-region which is soft for a heavy hadron is still hard for a light hadron such as a pion .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , this is the case for @xmath83 , since the pion yield decreases with increasing @xmath58 for @xmath84 , while the proton yield increases for @xmath85 .",
    "this opposite @xmath58-dependence at intermediate @xmath49 excludes the possibility that the ratios @xmath86 and @xmath65 decrease over the entire transverse momentum range with increasing medium - effects .",
    "this gives support to the idea that the enhancement of heavier hadrons , observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , is rather generic for jet quenching models .",
    "the success of mlla+lphd in reproducing hadrochemical distributions ( see e.g. fig .  [ fig2]a ) , as well as the model of medium modifications described in section  [ sec2b ] , are based on a _ mass effect _ : identified hadronic yields are determined by relating the qcd evolution scale to the mass of the hadron species .",
    "in contrast , rhic data indicate that the hadrochemical abundance of the underlying event in heavy ion collisions follows a _ valence quark counting rule _ in a wide intermediate transverse momentum range : the identified hadronic yields are characterized by a baryon - to - meson enhancement , irrespective of the hadron mass  @xcite .",
    "so , the hadrochemical composition of unmodified jets , and of the underlying event in heavy ion collisions appear to differ qualitatively .",
    "if parton energy loss constitutes the onset of a partonic equilibration mechanism , does this imply that the hadrochemical distribution of medium - modified jets approaches that of the medium , rather than remaining qualitatively different ?",
    "access to these and other far reaching questions may be gained by establishing whether the qualitative difference between jet hadrochemistry and bulk hadrochemistry persists at the lhc . here ,",
    "we shall not attempt to address these questions by building jet quenching models which implement specific features of hadrochemical equilibration .",
    "rather , we explore in a jet quenching model without hadrochemical equilibration ( namely that of section  [ sec2b ] ) , what happens if the particle identified yield of a jet is superimposed to a realistic heavy ion background .",
    "this may serve as a baseline on top of which signals of hadrochemical equilibration can be established .",
    "we first introduce in section  [ sec3a ] a recombination model for the underlying event in heavy ion collisions .",
    "then we superimpose in section  [ sec3b ] jet multiplicity distributions to this underlying event .      to model the underlying event we use the framework proposed in @xcite and further explored in  @xcite , in which hadrons are produced via two competing mechanisms , recombination and fragmentation .",
    "recombination models assume that hadrons can form by coalescence of constituents quarks , which are taken as effective degrees of freedom during hadronization .",
    "the recombination mechanism competes with the standard fragmentation of quarks into hadrons .",
    "recombination models typically discard gluonic degrees of freedom and use the same quark spectrum for the calculation of recombination and fragmentation contributions to single inclusive spectra . despite these simplifications , a fair description of relative hadrochemical yields",
    "is obtained  @xcite . here , we limit ourselves to central collisions and we specify the model input following ref .",
    "the main input for recombination models is knowledge about the partonic transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "this is typically modeled by a two - component distribution , showing an exponential `` thermal '' slope at low transverse momentum and displaying a characteristic power - law at high transverse momentum .",
    "we characterize the exponential component of the quark and anti - quark spectrum by the distribution @xmath87 this distribution is assumed to be emitted from spatio - temporal positions @xmath88 , which lie in a thermally equilibrated system at temperature @xmath89 along a space - like freeze - out hypersurface @xmath90 . here ,",

    "we denote by @xmath99 the momentum of partons , and by @xmath0 the momentum of hadrons .    the hard , power - law contribution to the quark spectrum",

    "parton energy loss is modeled by quenching this partonic spectrum via shifting its momentum distribution by @xmath104 , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "we now explain how these partonic spectra are turned into hadronic yields . for an exponential spectrum based on ( [ 3.1 ] ) , recombination always wins over fragmentation , since there are exponentially many recombination partners at soft @xmath105 . for a power - law tail ( [ 3.2 ] ) , however , fragmentation wins over recombination , since there are sufficiently many high-@xmath105 components which can fragment into softer ones .",

    "jet quenching amounts to a reshuffling of hadronic yield from high to low transverse momentum .",
    "the transverse momentum scale @xmath141 above which the yield in a jet spectrum is depleted is characterized in the measurement of @xmath142 by @xmath143 . from the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , one sees that @xmath141 grows significantly with @xmath69 .",
    "this indicates that the subleading jet fragments , additionally produced due to medium effects , are distributed in an increasingly wide transverse momentum regime which extends significantly beyond the low-@xmath0 region dominated by background yield , and up to @xmath141 .",
    "also , the total amount of additional multiplicity , produced due to parton energy loss , increases with @xmath69 , and so @xmath142 increases with @xmath69 in a wide intermediate transverse momentum regime in which hadrochemical identification is possible .",
    "the order of the particle species dependence of @xmath142 , seen in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , is a direct consequence of the medium - induced enhancement of the ratios @xmath144 and @xmath145 , seen in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "namely , if for instance at fixed transverse momentum , @xmath146 , then @xmath147 , and this order is reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .    , defined in ( [ 3.6 ] ) within a cone of opening angle @xmath137 as a function of transverse momentum for different jet energies and different hadron species . ]    -0.05 in",
    "the analysis of the hadrochemical composition of jets in heavy ion collisions is a _ terra incognita _ , for which data are not available yet .",
    "it is in experimental reach of the lhc . in this paper , we have argued that jet quenching generically implies modifications of the jet hadrochemical composition ( see discussion in sections  [ sec1 ] and [ sec2b ] ) . a simple model of a parton shower with enhanced medium - induced branching but unmodified hadronization ( see section  [ sec2b ] ) then allowed us to illustrate that a significantly modified jet hadrochemistry can be expected even if at the time of hadronization , medium effects are not present any more .",
    "this is important , since formation time arguments indicate that for sufficiently large @xmath69 , hadronization occurs outside the medium produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "remarkably , at sufficiently high @xmath0 , we observed that medium modifications increase the hadrochemical ratios @xmath86 and @xmath65 , thus further increasing the difference between the distributions inside the jet and those of the underlying event .",
    "we gave arguments of why this is likely to be a generic feature , which should persist for a wide class of jet quenching models .",
    "on the other hand , any jet quenching mechanism , which for instance kicks components of the background into the jet cone , may be expected to have the opposite effect , namely to narrow the difference between the hadrochemical composition of the jet and the background .",
    "it is in this sense , that we view the model study presented in sections  [ sec2b ] and [ sec3 ] as a baseline , on top of which effects indicative of specific microscopic mechanisms of parton energy loss may be established .",
    "we have profited from discussions with nicolas borghini , yuri dokshitzer , krzysztof golec - biernat , andreas morsch , karel safarik , jrgen schukraft , and yves schutz .",
    "we thank steffen bass , rainer fries and carlos salgado for sharing with us the results of simulations , documented in refs .",
    "we acknowledge support from the marie curie esrt fellowship of the european community s sixth framework programme under contract number ( mest - ct-2005 - 020238 ) , which made this project at cern possible .",
    "one of us ( s.s . ) also acknowledges a grant of the polish ministry of science , n202 048 31/2647 ( 2006 - 08 ) .",
