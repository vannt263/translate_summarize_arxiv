    "having defined families of one - way candidate functions , we are interested in which case functions @xmath40 are permutations , and when they are not . in this section",

    "we hope that this paper and the findings presented here will be sufficiently provocative for some readers to investigate them further and possibly give some solid mathematical explanations .",
    "there are a lot of classifications of quasigroups of a specific order .",
    "two main classifications are obtained by using the algebraic properties of the quasigroups : ( 1 ) classes of isotopic quasigroups , which are known only for quasigroups of orders up to 10 @xcite and ( 2 ) classes of isomorphic quasigroups @xcite .",
    "the importance of quasigroup classification is noted in many papers that deal with these algebraic structures ( for example see @xcite , @xcite ) .    from the point of view of this paper , classification of quasigroups can be done according to the nature of the one - way functions obtained by each quasigroup .",
    "since the number of quasigroups increases exponentially by the order of the quasigroup , we have made our experiments mainly for order 4 and some of our conjectures we have tested also on quasigroups of order 5 .",
    "the total number of quasigroups of order 4 is 576 .",
    "our experiments have shown that the set of all 576 quasigroups of order 4 can be divided into two classes .",
    "one class @xmath41 contains 192 quasigroups and the other class @xmath42 contains 384 quasigroups .",
    "if we order all quasigroups lexicographically from 1 to 576 , then the class @xmath41 contains the following quasigroups : @xmath43\\ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 37 , 40 , 43 , 46 , 49 , 51 , 54 , 57 , 60 , 63 , 70 , 71 , 77 , 80 , 82 , 83 , 92 , 93 , 100 , 101 , 110 , 111 , 113 , 116 , 121 , 126 , 127 , 132 , 133 , 138 , 139 , 144 , 145 , 146 , 147 , 148 , 157 , 160 , 163 , 166 , 169 , 170 , 171 , 172 , 174 , 176 , 178 , 179 , 182 , 185 , 189 , 192 , 196 , 197 , 203 , 206 , 212 , 213 , 218 , 222 , 223 , 228 , 229 , 232 , 234 , 235 , 242 , 243 , 246 , 252 , 253 , 259 , 262 , 263 , 269 , 272 , 274 , 275 , 284 , 285 , 292 , 293 , 302 , 303 , 305 , 308 , 314 , 315 , 318 , 324 , 325 , 331 , 334 , 335 , 342 , 343 , 345 , 348 , 349 , 354 , 355 , 359 , 364 , 365 , 371 , 374 , 380 , 381 , 385 , 388 , 392 , 395 , 398 , 399 , 401 , 403 , 405 , 406 , 407 , 408 , 411 , 414 , 417 , 420 , 429 , 430 , 431 , 432 , 433 , 438 , 439 , 444 , 445 , 450 , 451 , 456 , 461 , 464 , 466 , 467 , 476 , 477 , 484 , 485 , 494 , 495 , 497 , 500 , 506 , 507 , 514 , 517 , 520 , 523 , 526 , 528 , 531 , 534 , 537 , 540 , 549 , 550 , 551 , 552 , 553 , 556 , 559 , 563 , 566 , 568 , 570 , 572 , 573 , 574 , 575 , 576}. ( by the way , the quasigroup defined in table [ examplequasigroups4 ] by which we have performed examples in this paper has the lexicographic number 355 . )    from numerous experiments that we have performed , we can post the following conjectures :    for any quasigroup @xmath44 and for every natural number @xmath45 there exists at least one string @xmath46 such that the function @xmath40 is a permutation in the set @xmath47 .    for any quasigroup @xmath48 and for every natural number @xmath45",
    "there is no string @xmath46 such that the function @xmath40 is a permutation in the set @xmath47 .",
    "[ nfconj ]    the classes @xmath41 and @xmath42 have another interesting `` graphical '' property .",
    "namely , if we take the periodic string @xmath49 , and treat every letter as a pixel with the corresponding color , then by consecutive application of @xmath10transformations with any constant leader @xmath24 the set of 576 quasigroups can be divided into two classes : a class of quasigroups that give self - similar i.e. fractal images , and the class of quasigroups that give non self - similar images . as an example on figure",
    "[ q4647]a we show the image obtained by the quasigroup number 46 , and on figure [ q4647]b the image obtained by the quasigroup number 47 .",
    "cc     &     + a. & b. +    in @xcite one can find the same classification but instead of terms `` fractal '' and `` non - fractal '' classes of quasigroups they are named by an other property of them - a class of linear and a class of exponential quasigroups . in the same paper it is mentioned that when the order of quasigroup increases , the number of fractal ( linear ) quasigroups decreases exponentially compared to the number of non - fractal quasigroups .",
    "an additional classification that is close to the fractal  non - fractal classification can be found in @xcite and an excellent survey for many types of classifications of quasigroups is done in @xcite .",
    "it is really amazing how our experimental findings about the fractal  non - fractal classification of quasigroups comply with the classification of quasigroups that give one - way permutations and one - way functions .",
    "an open problem is to investigate the relation between these two classifications . here even without precise definition of what `` fractal '' quasigroup would mean , we just give the following conjecture :    the classes of fractal quasigroups and quasigroups for which there is a permutation @xmath40 coincide .",
    "in this section we would like to set the following convention : for a random oracle in the sense of rudich and impagliazzo works on one - way functions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we will take any quasigroup @xmath5 of order @xmath2 together with the family @xmath50 of one - way functions that can be defined by that quasigroup .",
    "rudich in his phd thesis @xcite , based on a combinatorial conjecture ( which was proved in 2000 by kahn , saks and smith in @xcite ) concluded that there exist oracles for which there exist one - way functions , but there are no one - way permutations .",
    "that is in perfect compliance with our case of quasigroup one - way functions .",
    "if the oracle ( quasigroup ) is non - fractal , our conjecture [ nfconj ] says that there are no strings @xmath51 such that the function @xmath40 is a permutation .",
    "impaliazzo and rudich in @xcite showed that `` there exist an oracle relative to which a strongly one - way permutation exists , but secure secret - key agreement is impossible . ''",
    "that is again in compliance with quasigroup one - way functions .",
    "namely , since quasigroup one - way functions rely on combinatorial characteristics of the quasigroups , in general there are no evident `` shortcuts '' and properties that will define a trapdoor function , that will enable secure secret - key agreement .",
    "quasigroup one - way functions are strong one - way functions i.e. there is only a small set of values on which they can be inverted in polynomial time .",
    "thus , security amplification of a weak one - way function by an iterative process , that was established as a very useful technique in the work of yao in 1982 @xcite is not necessary for quasigroup one - way functions .",
    "this means that the speed of computation of quasigroup one - way functions can be very high . additionally ,",
    "since the computations are done consecutively , they can be parallelized in a pipeline , and then the computation of the function can be done in time @xmath52 .",
    "some initial applications of quasigroup one - way functions and their properties to be easily parallelized are already done in definition of the stream cipher edon80 @xcite . in that stream cipher",
    "the ivsetup procedure is in fact a sort of quasigroup one - way function .    from theorem 2",
    "it follows that quasigroup one - way functions can achieve the level of security of @xmath3 attempts to invert the function with the length of the input being @xmath4 bits .",
    "that is most efficient construction as far as we know compared to other candidate one - way functions that require from @xmath53 to @xmath54 input bits to reach the security level of @xmath3 .",
    "the last property of quasigroup one - way functions that we want to mention in this paper , and that is similar to the properties that have been already found in other one - way functions is the property of a one - way function to be regular i.e. that have equal number of inversions on every point of their codomain .",
    "namely , in @xcite and @xcite techniques for obtaining 11 one - way functions are proposed if the one - way function is regular . in our numerous experiments , every time when we have used fractal quasigroup , the obtained one - way functions were either permutations or regular ones .",
    "the example that we show on figure [ examplegeneral]b .",
    "is an example of a regular function , where every point of its codomain has exactly two inversions .",
    "it would be a challenging task to apply the same techniques to quasigroup one - way functions .",
    "in this paper we have given a formal definition and construction of a new family of one - way functions and one - way permutations .",
    "they are based on quasigroup string transformations , and have numerous interesting properties . by some of those properties ( such as speed of computation , security level of inversion ) they outperform all currently known candidate one - way functions .",
    "many of our results concerning these functions are still experimental , and thus we have set up several conjectures about them .",
    "we hope that the intriguing experimental results mentioned in this paper about the new family of one - way functions will be interesting enough to attract attention of other researchers .",
