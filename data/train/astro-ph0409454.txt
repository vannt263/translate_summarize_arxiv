    "accretion of a background gas by a point - like particle is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics , occurring on size scales ranging from black holes in galactic nuclei to individual stars or compact objects accreting the winds of their companions .",
    "bondi , hoyle , and lyttleton @xcite treated this situation by considering the ideal problem of a massive point particle within a uniform gas moving at a constant speed with respect to the particle . for a polytropic gas , the problem is largely characterized by a single dimensionless parameter , the mach number @xmath0 , which is defined as the ratio of the gas - particle velocity to the sound speed of the uniform gas .",
    "( the ratio of specific heats @xmath1 also affects the accretion , but its effects are only order unity . )",
    "the bondi - hoyle formula gives the approximate accretion rate as a function of @xmath0 , which , in a version updated by @xcite and @xcite , is @xmath2^{1/2}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 is a number of order unity that depends on @xmath0 and on the equation of state . for @xmath4 ( bondi accretion ) in an isothermal medium , @xmath5 .",
    "the bondi - hoyle formula finds wide application in astrophysics .",
    "our first motivation for exploring this topic is star formation .",
    "the competitive accretion picture of star formation posits that protostars form with initially low masses , typically @xmath6 , and grow in mass by accreting unbound gas from the molecular clump in which they form @xcite .",
    "the competition for gas is invoked to explain the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this is a process of bondi - hoyle accretion , albeit in a turbulent medium , and one ought to be able to use a bondi - hoyle - like formula to estimate the rate at which the proposed `` seed '' protostars would accrete .",
    "a second significant area of application is in black holes , particularly the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of galaxies .",
    "numerous authors have used the bondi formula to estimate the rate at which smbhs accrete , and found that it substantially overestimates the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that rotation may explain the difference between accretion rates estimated from observations and those predicted by the bondi rate .",
    "a third area of application is in accretion rates onto compact objects .",
    "@xcite suggest that a combination of rotation and magnetic fields leads to lower accretion rates onto isolated neutron stars than one would estimate using the bondi formula .",
    "they argue that this lowered accretion rate accounts for the unexpectedly small number of isolated neutron stars that have been detected .",
    "previous authors have considered the problem of hydrodynamic accretion with non - zero vorticity , both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "@xcite analytically treated accretion of gas with non - zero angular momentum onto a black hole .",
    "they found that for very low angular momentum the flow pattern is similar to bondi accretion ; the flow is quasi - spherical , it becomes sonic at a radius much larger than the schwarzschild radius , and the accretion rate is comparable to the bondi rate . for high angular momentum , the gas forms a disk and the sonic radius in the equatorial plane becomes only a factor of a few times the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the accretion rate is substantially below the bondi rate .",
    "@xcite performed two dimensional axisymmetric simulations of the accretion of slowly rotating gas onto a black hole .",
    "they find three regimes of accretion . for sufficiently low total angular momentum ,",
    "the flow is bondi - like , similar to the pattern @xcite predicted . for intermediate total angular momentum , the highest angular momentum gas that can not accrete forms a dense torus about the black hole .",
    "the torus blocks off accretion except through a thin funnel along the poles , reducing the accretion rate to a value roughly independent of the total angular momentum . finally , for even higher total angular momentum , a centrifugal barrier , coupled with the dense torus , further reduces the accretion rate .    our goal in this paper is to unify this work by describing the accretion process using a one - parameter family similar to the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton treatment , and to give an analogous formula for the accretion rate as a function of this parameter .",
    "we do this using a combination of three - dimensional simulations and analytic treatment .",
    "in these two important respects , our work is more complete than previous work . in  [ analytic ] we give an analytic analysis of the problem , and present our approximate formula . in  [ method ]",
    "we describe the computational methodology we use in our simulations , and in  [ simulations ] we compare the results of our simulations to the analytic theory we put forth .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a point particle accreting in a medium with non - zero vorticity .",
    "the simplest case of this , which we treat here , is a medium with constant density and vorticity far from the particle , and where the gas has no net velocity of relative to the particle .",
    "thus , we consider a particle at the origin of our coordinate system , surrounded by a gas whose velocity far from the particle is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the standard bondi radius , @xmath9 is the mass of the particle , @xmath10 is the sound speed of the gas at infinity , and @xmath11 is the @xmath11 coordinate .",
    "the factor @xmath12 is a dimensionless number which we call the vorticity parameter , since the vorticity of the velocity field is @xmath13 , independent of position .",
    "the significance of @xmath12 is clear : @xmath14 corresponds to the case where gas with an impact parameter @xmath15 is traveling at the sound speed at infinity .",
    "the keplerian velocity at a distance of @xmath16 from the central object is @xmath17 thus , for @xmath14 , gas whose impact parameter is @xmath16 is traveling at the keplerian velocity for that impact parameter . since @xmath18 , while for our initial velocity field @xmath19 , gas with smaller impact parameters is sub - keplerian , while gas with larger impact parameters is super - keplerian . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the transition from sub- to super - keplerian @xmath21 occurs at impact parameters larger than @xmath16 ; for @xmath22 , the transition occurs at impact parameters smaller than @xmath16 . because the bondi radius is the distance at which gas comes within the gravitational sphere of influence of the central particle , provided its kinetic energy at infinity is small",
    ", we should expect a transition in behavior at @xmath23 .",
    "we note that previous authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have usually parameterized their flows in terms of specific angular momentum rather than vorticity , as we do here .",
    "the choice of parameterization is somewhat a matter of taste .",
    "specific angular momentum has the advantage that it yields a circularization radius for the flow that depends only on the specific angular momentum , simplifying the analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of vorticity enables us to invoke the kelvin circulation theorem in our analysis , which we find helpful .",
    "in addition , since specific angular momentum is a function of accretor position , and gas farther than @xmath16 from an accretor is unaware of its presence , arranging a flow with constant specific angular momentum requires an unlikely coincidence .",
    "it is more natural to characterize a flow by its velocity gradient , hence its vorticity , which is independent of accretor position .",
    "regardless of the choice of parameter , however , it is possible to make an approximate translation of the formulae we derive based on @xmath12 to ones in terms of the specific angular momentum . for the initial conditions we are considering",
    ", the specific angular momentum of a gas parcel with impact parameter @xmath11 is @xmath24 in the artificial case of a flow with constant specific angular momentum rather than constant vorticity , the equivalent value of @xmath12 should be determined roughly by the value of the vorticity at the bondi radius .",
    "thus , as an approximate conversion we suggest @xmath25 .    before moving on to analyze the behavior of accretion as a function of @xmath12 , we consider briefly the question of the gas equation of state . we choose to restrict ourselves to considering an isothermal gas , and we denote the constant sound speed as @xmath26 .",
    "this is physically appropriate for the star formation context : radiative energy transport in the dense molecular gas from which stars form is capable of eliminating any temperature variations on times small compared to the mechanical time scales in the gas @xcite . in the context of smbhs and compact objects ,",
    "the thermodynamics is more complicated , as the gas can range from isothermal to adiabatic depending on the efficiency of radiative energy transport .",
    "however , based on prior simulation work with bondi accretion @xcite , and accretion with shear @xcite , we do not believe that changes in the equation of state will change either the flow pattern or the accretion rate by more than a factor of order unity .",
    "@xcite performed the first detailed analysis of the cases of small and very small @xmath12 ( which we define below ) , that we shall review and extend .",
    "we can distinguish two regimes that occur for @xmath27 , depending on the physical dimensions of the accreting object . in the absence of viscosity or other mechanisms of angular momentum transport",
    ", a parcel of gas has constant specific angular momentum @xmath28 as it falls towards the accretor .",
    "the orbit of the gas parcel changes from predominantly radial to predominantly tangential at a characteristic circularization radius , where the parcel s velocity is roughly the kepler velocity .",
    "the specific angular momentum of a parcel of gas in keplerian rotation at a distance @xmath29 from the central object is @xmath30 and the circularization radius is therefore determined by the condition @xmath31 . equating ( [ linf ] ) and ( [ lkep ] )",
    ", a gas parcel at initial impact parameter @xmath11 has a circularization radius @xmath32 if the circularization radius for a given parcel of gas is small compared to the radius of the accretor , @xmath33 , then that gas will reach the surface of the accretor traveling in a predominantly radial orbit .",
    "its angular momentum , and its vorticity , will therefore be deposited in the central object and will not otherwise affect the flow pattern , leading to an accretion rate approximately equal to the bondi rate .    in the case of small vorticity , where the velocity of the gas at infinity is small compared to the keplerian velocity , gas begins to feel the influence of the accretor at a characteristic radius of @xmath16 .",
    "we can therefore distinguish our two regimes based on the relative sizes of @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath35 , then we are in the case analogous to that of a small circularization radius in a flow with constant specific angular momentum : the gas that reaches the accretor will be on primarily radial orbits , and the accretion rate should be the bondi rate .",
    "the condition for this to occur is @xmath36 we term the case @xmath37 `` very small @xmath12 . '' to get a sense of values of @xmath38 in typical cases , consider some of the applications we discussed in the introduction . in a star forming region , a typical accretor mass is @xmath39 and a typical sound speed is @xmath40 km s@xmath41 , giving a bondi radius of @xmath42 pc .",
    "a typical protostellar radius is @xmath43 cm , so @xmath44 . for the smbh at the center of the milky way , @xmath45 for the standard distance estimate @xcite .",
    "the temperature is not constant and depends on the details of radiative processes , but a reasonable estimate for gas far from the black hole is @xmath46 k @xcite , giving @xmath47 cm s@xmath41 and @xmath42 pc .",
    "the accretor radius is the schwarzschild radius @xmath48 cm , so again @xmath49 .",
    "note that this condition @xmath50 for bondi - like accretion is roughly equivalent to the conditions of @xcite and @xcite on the specific angular momentum when the accreting object is a non - rotating black hole . in that case , the accretor radius is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath51 , so @xmath52 , and the specific angular momentum of gas with impact parameter @xmath15 is @xmath53 in their analytical treatment , @xcite estimate that the critical specific angular momentum for bondi - like accretion @xmath54 ; however , the exact critical value will depend on the details of how the accretion flow joins onto the central object .",
    "if the vorticity is larger than @xmath38 , but still small compared to unity , then gas circularizes before it reaches the accretor .",
    "the accretor is effectively a point particle , and can not absorb angular momentum or vorticity from the flow . in this case",
    ", @xcite have found in their simulations that gas with too much angular momentum to accrete builds up into a torus around the accretor .",
    "this thick torus inhibits accretion by blocking off a large part of the solid angle through which streamlines could otherwise reach the accretor .",
    "we can explain the growth of the torus by making a useful analogy to magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the flow at infinity contains a constant vorticity . in regions of the flow that are",
    "non - viscous , the kelvin circulation theorem requires that the vorticity contained in an area element of the fluid is constant .",
    "this is analogous to flux - freezing in a magnetic medium .",
    "the accretor s gravity drags lines of vorticity in toward the accreting particle . near the particle , where viscosity may become significant ( for example due to magneto - rotational instability in the accretion disk )",
    ", gas can slip through the vortex lines and reach the accreting object .",
    "however , as long as the region of significant viscosity is confined near the accretor , the vortex lines can not escape . as accretion drags gas inward , vortex lines build up near the accretor , just as magnetic flux would build up in a magnetic flow .    the effect of this vorticity build - up is to increase the rotational velocity in the gas .",
    "consider a circular curve @xmath55 of radius @xmath56 in the @xmath57 plane , centered at the origin .",
    "the circulation around curve @xmath55 is the line integral of the velocity , @xmath58 and by stokes theorem @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the vector vorticity at any point in the flow and @xmath61 is the area inside curve @xmath55 . as a reference state , consider a velocity field with @xmath62 everywhere .",
    "the accretion process increases vorticity within the curve relative to this reference state , so it must also increase @xmath63 and hence the mean rotational velocity @xmath64 around @xmath55 . because the vorticity parameter @xmath65 , we know that initially @xmath66 as long as @xmath67",
    ". however , this analysis shows that @xmath64 increases with time , so eventually the rotational velocity will become comparable to the keplerian velocity and a rotationally supported disk must form .",
    "the keplerian velocity is supersonic for all radii smaller than @xmath16 , and the inflow onto the disk is not purely radial , so the disk will likely develop internal shocks and a time - dependent structure .",
    "the process of vorticity increase near the accretor can not continue indefinitely .",
    "eventually , inward transport of vorticity by accreting matter must be balanced by an outward flow of vorticity in gas leaving the vicinity of the accretor and escaping to infinity .",
    "the radius at which gas becomes unbound from the accretor and can start escaping is @xmath16 , and we therefore expect that the disk will extend out to @xmath68 in radius .",
    "the scale height of a thin keplerian disk is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the angular velocity .",
    "since the disk radius is @xmath68 , we expect @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the scale height is comparable to the radius and we have , rather than a disk , a thick torus",
    ". the torus may be somewhat thicker for an equation of state with ratio of specific heats @xmath1 greater than unity , because in that case the sound speed will increase inside the bondi radius due to compressional heating .",
    "however , the compression should be is only order unity at @xmath72 , so the effect of compression on the torus scale height should also be order unity .",
    "the circulation trapped within the torus should be @xmath73 in our reference state with @xmath62 everywhere , the circulation is @xmath74 which is clearly much smaller than the equilibrium value of @xmath63 for @xmath27 .",
    "the time required for the circulation to build up to @xmath63 is determined by the rate at which mass falling onto the accreting object carries vorticity inwards .",
    "the gas within the bondi radius reaches the central object , or the growing disk , on the bondi time scale , @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the flow replaces the gas within the bondi radius on this time scale .",
    "each set of `` replacement '' gas carries the same vorticity as the gas it is replacing , and therefore increases the circulation by @xmath76 . as a result ,",
    "the time required for the accumulating vorticity to reach its equilibrium value is approximately @xmath77 this estimate only applies for @xmath78 , when accumulation of circulation is the key factor in setting the final accretion rate .    we can roughly estimate the amount by which the accretion rate will be reduced by the presence of the torus once the flow reaches equilibrium .",
    "the torus reduces accretion by blocking off solid angle through which material could otherwise accrete .",
    "if the torus extends out to @xmath16 , and its height is roughly @xmath16 as well , it blocks all angles in the range @xmath79 .",
    "if the reduction in accretion rate is proportional to the fraction of solid angle blocked , then the accretion rate for this case should be reduced to @xmath80 of the bondi rate , @xmath81 , given by equation ( [ bhformula ] ) for @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to note that the equilibrium state we describe here does not depend on the value of @xmath12 , as long as @xmath82 .",
    "the equilibrium radius of the torus depends only on the maximum vorticity that can accumulate near the accretor before the velocity becomes comparable to the kepler velocity and halts infall in the disk .",
    "thus , the equilibrium radius of the torus is @xmath83 independent of @xmath12 , and the scale height and accretion rate are also @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "different values of @xmath12 only mean that vorticity builds up more or less slowly , and thus that there is a longer or shorter initial transient .      the final case to consider is @xmath86 . in this regime ,",
    "the velocity of the gas at the bondi radius is comparable to or larger than the keplerian velocity . to derive an approximate accretion rate",
    ", we adopt an ansatz from bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "regardless of its velocity , gas at infinity initially has a positive total energy .",
    "its potential energy is zero and it has non - zero internal energy . in order to become bound and accrete onto the point mass",
    ", the gas must lose its energy by shocking .",
    "if gas does shock , it is likely to accrete .",
    "since the flow at infinity is laminar , shocks will only occur for those streamlines that are bent significantly by the gravity of the accreting particle . to determine",
    "if a straight streamline is susceptible to bending , we can compare the velocity of gas on that streamline ( adding both bulk and thermal velocity ) to the maximum value of the escape velocity along that streamline . if the peak escape velocity is larger , then the streamline will bend and is likely to terminate in a shock .",
    "suppose the gas at infinity is traveling in the @xmath87 direction , and consider a streamline that begins at @xmath88 coordinates @xmath89 .",
    "the streamline will bend significantly and pass through a shock if @xmath90 in the bondi - hoyle case , @xmath91 independent of @xmath11 and @xmath92 .",
    "thus , ( [ vesccondition ] ) reduces to @xmath93 where we have used the standard definition for the bondi - hoyle radius .",
    "if we make the assumption that all parcels of gas traveling on streamlines that bend significantly go through shocks , and all gas that shocks loses enough energy to become bound and eventually reach the accretor , then the rate at which mass accretes onto the particle is equal to the rate at which gas from infinity begins traveling on streamlines that meet condition ( [ vesccondition ] ) .",
    "we can therefore define an area @xmath61 in the plane at infinity that satisfies ( [ vesccondition ] ) and approximate the accretion rate by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the density of the gas at infinity and we have again added the bulk and thermal velocities of the gas in quadrature . for the bondi - hoyle case , @xmath61 is simply a circle of radius of radius @xmath96 and @xmath21 is a constant , so the integral is trivial . evaluating it",
    "gives @xmath97 which is just the bondi - hoyle formula ( equation [ bhformula ] ) up to factors of order unity .",
    "because this ansatz allows us to reproduce the bondi - hoyle formula , we will apply it to predict the case of accretion with vorticity . in this case , @xmath98 , so ( [ vesccondition ] ) becomes @xmath99 with the convenient change of variable @xmath100 and @xmath101 , this becomes @xmath102 we can solve ( [ aomega1 ] ) for @xmath103 to find the function @xmath104 that defines the boundary : @xmath105 we refer to region of the @xmath106 plane bounded by @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath109 on the boundary of @xmath108 occurs for @xmath110 , and is @xmath111 figure [ aplot ] shows the boundary of @xmath108 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the approximate accretion rate is @xmath112 where we have defined the numerical factor @xmath113 the integral is straightforward to evaluate numerically , and we plot the result in figure [ fplot ] .",
    "we can also obtain an approximation for @xmath114 in the limit @xmath115 .",
    "we show in appendix [ integralapprox ] that in the limit @xmath116 , we can approximate @xmath114 by @xmath117 we also show this approximation in figure [ fplot ] .",
    "we must make one further modification to our estimated accretion rate . in the limit @xmath118 , @xmath119 and ( [ mdotapprox1 ] )",
    "reduces to approximately @xmath81 .",
    "thus , this approximation smoothly interpolates between the cases @xmath27 and @xmath86 .",
    "however , we have already seen that even in the case @xmath27 the accretion rate can be substantially below the bondi rate , since the accumulation of circulation leads to the formation of a thick torus that blocks streamlines from reaching the accretor .",
    "the same phenomenon should happen with @xmath120 .",
    "circulation will still accumulate near the accretor .",
    "the shape of the torus should be the same as in the @xmath27 case , because that is set just by the physics of disks .",
    "we therefore reduce our estimated accretion rate ( [ mdotapprox1 ] ) by a constant factor so that it matches our estimate of @xmath121 for the case @xmath122 .",
    "the required factor is @xmath123 ; it is not exactly 0.3 because ( [ mdotapprox1 ] ) for @xmath27 differs from the bondi rate by a small factor .    with this modification in place , ( [ mdotapprox1 ] )",
    "should give a good approximation of the accretion rate for all @xmath124 .",
    "our final estimate for the accretion rate by a flow with vorticity @xmath12 at infinity is @xmath125 in  [ conclusions ] we give a more accurate approximation that is calibrated by our simulations .",

    ", we describe the simulation methodology , and in the next we compare the simulation results to our theory .      the calculations in this paper",

    "the code solves these equations using a conservative high - order godunov scheme with an optimized approximate riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is second - order accurate in both space and time for smooth flows , and it provides robust treatment of shocks and discontinuities .",
    "although the code is capable of solving the poisson equation for the gravitational field @xmath132 of the gas based on the density distribution , in this work we neglect the gas self - gravity and include only the gravitational force of the central object .",
    "the potential is therefore @xmath133 where @xmath9 is the mass of the central object and @xmath29 is the distance from it .",
    "we do not adopt the @xcite potential frequently used for simulations involving black holes because we are do not wish to limit ourselves to the case of black holes , and because even in the black hole case we are interested in the regime where the schwarzschild radius is extremely small on scales of the grid , so that general relativistic effects are not important .",
    "our code operates within the amr framework @xcite , and is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we discretize the problem domain onto a base , coarse level , denoted level 0 .",
    "we dynamically create finer levels , numbered @xmath134 , recursively nested within one another . to take a time step , one advances level @xmath135 through a single time step @xmath136 , and then advances each subsequent level for the same amount of time .",
    "each level has its own time step , and in general @xmath137 , so after advancing level 0 we must advance level 1 through several steps of size @xmath138 , until it has advanced a total time @xmath139 as well . in all the simulations we present in this paper , we chose cell spacings such that @xmath140 , and thus we take two time steps on level 1 for each time step on level 0 .",

    ", we represent the central , accreting object with a sink particle @xcite . one noteworthy feature of our sink particle , which we shall discuss further in  [ sinkmethod ] , is that the sink particle does not accrete any angular momentum from the gas in the computational grid .",
    "this is in contrast the sink methodologies used by previous authors ( e.g. @xcite ) , where the sink could accrete angular momentum as well as mass .",
    "our approach is appropriate for @xmath142 , which is the case on which we focus .      for each run , we place a sink particle at the origin of an initially uniform gas .",
    "the gas has an initial velocity field @xmath143 where we use different values of @xmath12 in different runs .",

    ", we also used a range of @xmath144 to @xmath145 for smaller values of @xmath12 . for larger values of @xmath12 , though , the large velocities that occur at large values of @xmath11 produce very small time steps that make the computation prohibitively expensive .",

    "we set up our adaptive grids such that , at any radius @xmath29 , the local grid resolution is @xmath149 .",
    "as table [ simtable ] indicates , we vary @xmath12 from @xmath150 to @xmath151 , thereby thoroughly exploring the small @xmath12 and large @xmath12 regimes .",
    "however , none of our work explores the very small @xmath12 regime .",
    "this is for two reasons , one physical and one technical . in order to explore the very small @xmath12 case , one must use either an unphysically small value of @xmath12 or an unphysically large accretor radius , leading to an unrealistically large @xmath38 . as we have shown in ",
    "[ verysmall ] , for typical astrophysical situations in which accretion with vorticity is important , @xmath152 .",
    "this is a truly tiny amount of vorticity , corresponding to a shear of one thousandth of the sound speed at one bondi radius . in the case of a protostar in a molecular clump",
    ", this corresponds to a velocity gradient of no more than @xmath153 cm s@xmath41 over a distance of @xmath154 pc ; for the galactic center , it corresponds to a gradient of @xmath155",

    "it is difficult to see how to produce such an irrotational flow field , and thus the very small @xmath12 case is not relevant for the applications with which we are concerned .",
    "the technical reason we do not treat the very small @xmath12 case is that our sink particle method is constructed to exactly conserve total angular momentum during the accretion process .",
    "( for details , see @xcite . )",
    "transfer of vorticity from the flow to the accretor is the distinguishing characteristic of flow with @xmath156 .",
    "however , since our sink particle does not change the angular momentum of the flow field , it actually increases vorticity by removing mass while leaving angular momentum .",
    "our code does dissipate vorticity via numerical viscosity , as we discuss in more detail in  [ convergence ] on convergence testing .",
    "however , this effect is small except in the inner few zones . on balance , we consider this approach more realistic than the standard technique of allowing any angular momentum that enters a chosen accretion region to accrete . in reality",
    ", a small accretor should absorb negligible angular momentum from the flow on scales much larger than the accretor radius . in real accretion disks ,",
    "viscosity acts to transfer mass inwards and angular momentum outwards .",
    "this is exactly the approximation we adopt in our sink particle method : mass travels inwards , angular momentum does not .",
    "while ideally one would follow the flow down to the true physical surface of the accretor , this is computationally infeasible in more than one dimension even with amr .",
    "our sink particle method provides a more realistic approximation of the behavior of an accretion disk than would allowing angular momentum to accrete .",
    "in each of the simulations , the flow went through a transient and then settled down into a quasi - equilibrium state . the time required to reach equilibrium increased with decreasing @xmath12 , ranging from @xmath157 for @xmath158 to @xmath159 for @xmath86 , where @xmath75 is the bondi time . in the equilibrium configuration , all the runs except @xmath160 built up dense material around the accretor .",
    "the material was not in a symmetric disk , but rather in a pinwheel shape .",
    "the velocity patterns associated with these pinwheels generally involved matter flowing in from the @xmath92 direction through an accretion funnel and either circulating or outflowing in the @xmath57 plane .",
    "this overall morphology agrees well with the results of @xcite .",
    "figures [ omloslice ] , [ ommedslice ] , and [ omhislice ] illustrate the morphology for @xmath158 , 1 , and @xmath151 .",
    "a comparison of runs at different @xmath12 values shows several clear trends .",
    "first , the accumulated pinwheel of matter is much smaller at large @xmath12 than at small @xmath12 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the accumulated matter extends out to @xmath161 , while for @xmath116 it is well inside the bondi radius and is less massive .",
    "the size of the pinwheel changes only slightly with @xmath12 for @xmath78 , but shrinks dramatically for @xmath86 . our theoretical description of the torus we expect for small @xmath12 appears to be roughly correct : a torus of material accumulates that extends out to @xmath68 and has a height comparable to its radius",
    ". the tori are chaotic and time - variable . for larger @xmath12 ,",
    "the pinwheels are more regular and less chaotic , and are accompanied by leading and trailing shocks .",
    "the shocks are moderately strong , with mach numbers @xmath162 .    for @xmath78",
    ", we do not find that the torus has constant specific angular momentum , as @xcite did . in our torii ,",
    "the specific angular momentum of the gas varies by orders of magnitude .",
    "it is unclear if this difference in results is due to different initial conditions , or due to the fact that our simulations are three - dimensional where theirs were two - dimensional .",
    "however , we agree with @xcite that the size and shape of the torus is largely independent of @xmath12 ( or the initial specific angular momentum @xmath163 ) , and that its equilibrium structure arises due to the accumulation of material with too much vorticity ( or @xmath163 ) to accrete . as figures",
    "[ omloslice ] and [ ommedslice ] show , accretion occurs only through a narrow funnel , and the ( invariant ) shape of the torus therefore determines the accretion rate .",
    "for each run we computed the average dimensionless circulation @xmath63 as a function of time .",
    "we define the dimensionless circulation within a circle of radius @xmath16 in the @xmath57 plane as @xmath164 where the line integral is evaluated on the circle @xmath165 .",
    "the circulation is a measure of the amount of vorticity within one bondi radius of the accretor . with this definition of dimensionless circulation , in the initial configuration of the velocity field",
    "the circulation is equal to the vorticity parameter , @xmath166 .",
    "our prediction for the equilibrium circulation for @xmath78 is @xmath167 , or @xmath168 .",
    "we plot the circulation versus time along with the accretion rate versus time for each of our runs in figure [ accpanel ] .",
    "the behavior of the circulation with time depends on the value of @xmath12 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the circulation starts at @xmath12 and gradually increases until it reaches @xmath169 .",
    "then it fluctuates around this mean . for @xmath170 ,",
    "@xmath171 decreases from its initial value until it again reaches the range @xmath169 . as @xmath12 increases , however , @xmath171 decreases less and less in the time it takes the accretion rate to reach equilibrium .",
    "the accretion rate and the circulation appear to be anti - correlated for @xmath78 in the period before equilibration : the initial buildup of circulation takes about the same amount of time as the initial decrease in the accretion rate .",
    "this supports our hypothesis that vortex lines are acting like magnetic flux lines and inhibiting accretion .    for each run",
    "we estimate by eye the time at which the flow pattern and accretion rate reach equilibrium , and we compute the mean circulation after this time .",
    "we report the equilibration times and the mean circulations in table [ simtable ] ; we plot the equilibrium value of @xmath171 in figure [ gammaplot ] , and the equilibration time in figure [ teqplot ] .",
    "as the figures show , the equilibrium value of the circulation is at most very weakly dependent on the initial vorticity for @xmath78 , varying by less than a factor of 2 while the initial vorticity varies by a factor of 100 .",
    "the flow pattern re - arranges itself to select @xmath172 by accumulating a dense torus of material rotating at nearly keplerian speeds around the accretor .",
    "the equilibrium value is smaller than our prediction of @xmath168 , indicating that the rotational velocity is sub - keplerian .",
    "this result is consistent with the morphology of the gas flow .",
    "the gas has a non - zero radial velocity and thus can be marginally bound even with tangential velocities that are sub - keplerian . our analytic model , because it fails to predict the chaotic nature of the flow pattern , overestimates the equilibrium value of @xmath171 by a factor of @xmath173 .",
    "it does , however , correctly predict that there is an equilibrium @xmath171 for @xmath78 . at @xmath86",
    ", the pinwheel of unaccreted matter is confined closer to the accretor , and is unable to affect the circulation on length scales @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the circulation for larger @xmath12 stays constant .",
    "the equilibration time is also roughly consistent with our prediction of @xmath174 for @xmath78 .",
    "part of the scatter of the line comes from the unavoidable subjectivity in our estimate of the equilibration time in such a chaotic flow",
    ". however , our model is clearly only approximate .",
    "while we correctly capture the trend of increasing equilibration time with decreasing @xmath12 , our inability to model the turbulent flow means that our prediction of the equilibration time , like our prediction of @xmath171 , is accurate to at best a factor of a few .    in the plots of @xmath171 and @xmath175 versus @xmath12 ( and as we show below , in the plot of @xmath176 versus @xmath12 as well ) , there seems to be a change in behavior between the @xmath177 and @xmath178 runs . rather than smoothly interpolating bewteen @xmath27 and @xmath116 ,",
    "the trend with @xmath12 appears to jump from one track to another .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that this is simply the result of chance and our sparse sampling @xmath12 values .",
    "near @xmath14 , the equilibrium values of quantities like @xmath171 and @xmath175 may be fluctuating chaotically with @xmath12 , and the sharp jump we see from @xmath177 to @xmath179 may just be a fluctuation .",
    "however , it is also possible that there is a distinct regime of intermediate @xmath12 , as well as the small and large @xmath12 , and that several properties of the equilibrium flow change suddenly when one enters this new regime .",
    "we ran each of our simulations until the accretion rate converged to a steady state , and then we measured both the mean accretion rate and the fluctuations about the mean .",
    "table [ simtable ] summarizes our results and figure [ accpanel ] shows the accretion rate versus time for each run .",
    "we filter out short time scale noise associated with the finite resolution of our simulation by only computing the standard deviation in accretion rate averaged over 16 time steps .",
    "nonetheless , discreteness error does lead to a non - zero standard deviation even in the case @xmath160 , which is pure bondi accretion and should have zero standard deviation .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath180 gives a lower limit on our ability to measure fluctuations in the accretion rate .",
    "since the standard deviations we measure for other runs are significantly larger than this , they likely represent real physical time variability , not just simulation noise .",
    "we plot the mean accretion rate as a function of @xmath12 in figure [ accplot ] .",
    "we also show our theoretical prediction ( solid line ) , which fits the data reasonably well . to obtain a somewhat better fit",
    ", we keep the function @xmath114 the same and do a least squares fit to obtain a pre - factor to replace 0.34 in equation ( [ mdotapprox ] ) .",
    "we find a best - fit value of 0.40 .",
    "this value produces a good fit , as shown in the dashed line in figure [ accplot ] .",
    "the formula fits each of the simulation values to better than 40% .",
    "this is comparable to the accuracy of the bondi - hoyle formula at intermediate mach numbers @xcite .      to test the convergence of our simulations",
    ", we repeated one of our runs at higher resolution . @xcite",
    "have hypothesized that the accretion rate in bondi accretion with vorticity is proportional to @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is between @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "@xcite saw a small dependence of the accretion rate on @xmath181 for some of their simulations with smaller dynamic ranges , but the variation seemed to disappear in their simulations with larger dynamic ranges . in our sink particle method ,",
    "the central object can not accrete angular momentum , so in the absence of numerical viscosity , we would be in the limit @xmath186 .",
    "however , as we have noted above , numerical viscosity does set an effective minimum size for our accretor . in the inner few cells of the simulation grid , where the circles in which the gas is attempting to move are poorly resolved",
    ", our code does not perfectly conserve angular momentum or vorticity .",
    "it is difficult to determine an equivalent accretor size set by this phenomenon , but we have found that even at our lowest resolution of @xmath187 , our simulations produce disks and accumulation of circulation rather than bondi - like flow for @xmath12 as small as @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the effective value of @xmath181 set by our method must be @xmath189 .",
    "( recall that typical values of @xmath181 in astrophysical systems are closer to @xmath190 . )",
    "regardless of the true effective accretor radius imposed by numerical viscosity , by changing the grid size , and thus the rate of angular momentum dissipation , we are testing whether the accretion rate truly depends on @xmath181 when @xmath186 .    to test for convergence ,",
    "we re - ran our simulation with @xmath170 at a resolution of @xmath191 , four times the fiducial resolution .",
    "all other aspects of the simulation were identical .",
    "we plot the accretion rate versus time for the two differently resolved versions of the run in figure [ convfig ] . as the results show , the exact shape of the accretion rate versus time graph is not the same at the different resolutions .",
    "this is to be expected in an unstable and chaotic flow .",
    "however , the overall accretion rates appear to be approximately the same .",
    "we find a mean accretion rate after equilibration of @xmath192 for the run with @xmath187 , and a mean of @xmath193 for the run with @xmath191 .",
    "the standard deviations in the accretion rates are @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively , while the difference in means is only @xmath196 .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is no dependence of the accretion rate on @xmath181 in the limit @xmath197 .",
    "the results also suggest that our simulations are converged .",
    "in contrast , consider the hypothesis of @xcite that the accretion rate scales as @xmath182 for @xmath183 in the range 0.5 to 1 . by increasing the resolution by a factor of 4 ,",
    "we should have decreased @xmath181 by a factor of 4 , and thus the @xcite proposal predicts we should have measured an accretion rate in the range @xmath198 to @xmath199 for the higher resolution simulation .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with our results .",
    "we emphasize , however , that we have only tested the hydrodynamic case .",
    "@xcite made their hypothesis for both hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic flows , and we have not tested the latter case .",
    "we provide a general theoretical framework for considering problems of accretion in a medium with vorticity . using simple analytic estimates ,",
    "we have been able to derive a formula for the rate of mass accretion onto a point particle of radius @xmath33 as a function of the vorticity present in the ambient medium .",
    "we define the dimensionless vorticity parameter @xmath12 as @xmath200 where @xmath16 is the accretor s bondi radius and @xmath26 is the sound speed .",
    "we find that the accretion rate is @xmath201 for @xmath202 , where @xmath114 is the function defined by ( [ fomega ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath114 has the limiting behavior @xmath203 for @xmath27 , and @xmath204 for @xmath116 .",
    "simulations show that our formulation provides a good fit to the overall shape of the curve of accretion rate versus vorticity . by calibrating our first - principle calculation using the results of our simulations ,",
    "we provide a formula that agrees with the mean accretion rate we measure in our simulations to better than 40% , all over 3.5 orders of magnitude variation in vorticity .",
    "our result is a natural extension of the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton formula to rotating flows .",
    "we are also able to roughly predict several other properties of the flow , including the overall morphology , the equilibrium vorticity , and the equilibration time .",
    "our predictions for these quantities are considerably less accurate than for the accretion rate , but our formulae are correct to within factors of a few .",
    "we see ambiguous evidence for the existence of an intermediate @xmath12 regime , which is characterized by a rapid change in equilibrium flow properties starting between @xmath205 and @xmath170 .",
    "our analytic model does not predict such the existence of such a transition , and it is possible that what we have seen is a result of numerical noise .",
    "regardless , it does seem clear that the analytic model runs into trouble when @xmath206 . since we derived it for the regimes @xmath27 and @xmath116 , and simply interpolated between those , this is not surprising .",
    "the simulations we use to check our formulation have very general and simple initial conditions .",
    "we have avoided complications arising from boundary conditions by moving the boundaries very far away from the accreting object , and our sink particle method allows us to avoid the need for an unrealistically large accretor radius .",
    "our theoretical discussion shows that the accretion rate is controlled by a combination of vorticity build - up near the accretor and , for @xmath86 , the rate at which gas with low enough energy to accrete approaches the accreting particle . as a result",
    ", our results should be extremely robust .",
    "our results allow direct application to observed systems .",
    "one may determine the vorticity in a astrophysical system by observing a velocity gradient across it , which is often feasible using radio line observations .",
    "consider an example in the context of star formation : @xcite observed dense molecular cores in nearby star - forming regions .",
    "they found velocity gradients of @xmath207 km s@xmath41 pc@xmath41 , in regions with typical temperatures of @xmath153 k ( sound speed @xmath208 km s@xmath41 for a mean molecular mass of @xmath209 ) .",
    "this means that a one solar mass protostar ( @xmath210 pc ) inside such a dense core has a vorticity parameter @xmath211 ( specific angular momentum @xmath212 gr cm s@xmath41 , and should have its accretion rate reduced by a factor of @xmath213 relative to the bondi rate .",
