    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to arise from the sudden release of a vast amount of energy ( @xmath10erg for long grbs and probably somewhat less energy for short grbs ) , into a very small region ( of size @xmath11 km ) , over a short time ( @xmath12s for long grbs and @xmath13s for short grbs ) .",
    "the prompt @xmath14-ray emission is attributed to internal shocks within the outflow @xcite that are caused by variability in its lorentz factor , @xmath15 .",
    "the highly non - thermal gamma - ray spectrum requires @xmath16 to avoid the _ compactness problem _ ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "when the relativistic ejecta sweep up a sufficient amount of external medium , they are decelerated by a ( typically mildly relativistic ) reverse shock ; at the same time a highly relativistic forward shock is driven into the ambient medium .",
    "this forward shock produces the long - lasting afterglow emission , while the short lived reverse shock produces a prompt optical emission ( _ optical flash _ ) ; the latter peaks on a time scale of tens of seconds @xcite and dominates the optical emission up to about ten minutes .",
    "grbs naturally divide into two classes according to their duration and the hardness of their prompt gamma - ray emission : short / hard bursts ( @xmath17s ) and long / soft bursts ( @xmath18s ) @xcite . until very recently ,",
    "afterglow emission was detected only for long grbs , leading to significant progress in their understanding .",
    "to date over 50 spectroscopic redshifts have been determined ( typically @xmath19 ) and an association of some long grbs with a contemporaneous type ic supernova @xcite has been established , which implies a massive star as the long grb progenitor and thus , supports the collapsar model @xcite . until the launch of _ swift _",
    "@xcite , the progenitors of short grbs remained largely a mystery .",
    "the leading short grb model featuring the merger of a compact binary , usually ns - ns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or ns - bh ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , was given strong support recently with the detection of afterglow emission from three short grbs : 050509b , 050709 , and 050724 @xcite .    before _ swift _ ,",
    "x - ray afterglow emission was detected , in most cases , only several hours after the burst , by which time the flux typically showed a smooth single power law decay @xmath20 .",

    "however , the _ early _ afterglow evolution  the first few hours , which can probe important questions such as the density profile of the external medium and the early radiative energy losses from the external shock  remained largely unexplored .",

    "we report for the first time cumulative early x - ray afterglow properties of the first 27 _ long _ grbs well - observed by the _ swift_/xrt . in  [ data ] we describe our data analysis method .",
    "our observational results are presented in  [ obs ] . in  [ theory ]",
    "we discuss the theoretical interpretation and implications of our findings , and our conclusions are summarized in  [ conc ] .",
    "we have analyzed xrt data of the first 27 _ swift _  grb afterglows covering the time interval between december 2004 - june 2005 .",
    "data for each burst were obtained from the _ swift _  quick look site and processed consistently with version 2.0 of the _ swift _  software ( release date 2005 - 04 - 05 ) . in all cases we used xselect to extract source and background counts from the cleaned event lists ( @xmath24kev ) , using grades 0 - 12 for photon counting ( pc ) mode data , 0 - 2 for windowed timing ( wt ) and 0 - 5 for photo - diode ( pd ) .",
    "we used the european southern observatory ( eso ) munich imaging data analysis system ( midas , version 04sep ) , to create the x - ray afterglow light curves for each event .",
    "the data were binned dynamically to have a certain number of photons per bin .",
    "for very bright bursts and at early times after a burst trigger , the binning was set to 500 photons per bin , while at very late times , or for very faint bursts , the binning was set to 10 counts per bin . on average ,",
    "light curves were created with 50 counts per bin .",
    "all light curves were background subtracted .",
    "the exposure times per bin were calculated on the basis of the good time interval ( gti ) file .",
    "these light curves were then compared to ones derived independently with the ftool * flx2xsp*. each time bin in the latter was selected for high signal to noise ratio , after background subtraction ; we required at least 20 counts per bin in order to facilitate @xmath25 fitting .",
    "the data sets derived using these two independent methods were found to agree very well .",
    "finally , in both methods , we took into account the mode switching during the _",
    "swift_/xrt observation , which can distort the real count rate during an event .",
    "several of the grbs included in this paper were observed while _",
    "swift_was still in its calibration phase , before the automatic mode - switching for the xrt was fully enabled .",
    "some of the data obtained in pc mode suffered , therefore , from pile - up , which had to be corrected before the light - curves and spectra were fully analyzed . to account for source pileup ( significant above 0.5 counts / s in photon counting mode )",
    ", annular regions were used to extract the source spectra and light - curves . to determine the level of pile - up ,",
    "the inner radius of the annulus was gradually increased until the spectral shape no longer changed ( pile - up leads to the hardening of photon indices ) .",
    "background spectra and light - curves were then produced from large ` source - free ' regions , offset from the grb , and the background counts were scaled to the same size region as used for the source .",
    "the ftool * xrtmkarf * was used to generate ancillary response function ( arf ) files .",
    "where an annular region had been required , * xrtmkarf * was run twice , with and without the point spread function ( psf ) correction . fitting the spectra with both arfs leads to different normalizations , the ratio of which gives the pile - up correction factor .",
    "the most recent ( version 7 ) response matrices ( rmfs ) were used in the spectral analysis .",
    "the light - curves were extracted for each individual orbit of data , correcting for pile - up when annuli were used . at later times , or when no pile - up was apparent , circles of radius 20 - 30 pixels ( 1 pixel = 2.36@xmath26 ) were used .",
    "the xspec ( version 11.3.2 ) readable light - curves produced by * flx2xsp * were modeled in xspec with a combination of single and broken power - laws to determine the decay slopes and break times .",
    "the time of the burst onset was taken from the msbal.fits tdrss file , which normally corresponds to the time when the bat instrument recognized the burst through an image trigger , except for the case of grb  @xmath27 , where the event started while _ swift _  was slewing to a different target ( although triggers are disabled during slews , the bat triggered on a later peak in the light - curve of grb  @xmath27 ) . to determine an energy conversion factor ( ecf ) from count - rate to fluxes ,",
    "a simple absorbed ( galactic @xmath28 , determined from * ? ? ?",
    "* together with any required excess ) power - law was fitted to the xrt spectra ( @xmath29 kev ) .",
    "the ecfs were then determined for unabsorbed fluxes .",
    "if no significant spectral changes were observed , only one ecf was applied per light curve .",
    "until july 2005 , only 10 _ swift _  grbs had measured redshifts .",

    "[ f_x(t ) ] we see that a general trend starts to emerge that may become the standard to describe each grb x - ray afterglow light curve . starting at the earliest xrt observations ( approximately @xmath30s after the prompt gamma - rays ) , the x - ray flux @xmath31 follows a canonical behavior comprising three power law segments where @xmath32 ( see also fig . [ diagram ] ) : an initial steep decay slope ( @xmath33 ) , which ( at @xmath34 ) changes into a very flat decay ( @xmath7 ) , that in turn ( at @xmath8 ) transitions to a slightly steeper slope ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the temporal and spectral parameters for all 27 events , as well as the break times ( @xmath34 and @xmath8 ) , the bat trigger times , and the onset of the xrt data after trigger .",
    "the spectrum remained constant throughout the breaks ( within our available statistics ) in all cases except two ( grbs 050315 and 050319 ) where the spectrum hardened ( i.e. @xmath36 decreased ) across the first break ( at @xmath6 ) .",
    "[ alpha123 ] shows the distribution of all temporal indices ( @xmath33 , @xmath7 and @xmath35 ) together with the spectral index ( @xmath37 ) for the grbs in table 1 .",
    "table 1 shows that in about half ( @xmath38 ) of the cases we were able to slew to the initial bat location with xrt only several thousands of seconds after the grb trigger ; in the majority of these cases we detect one or even no temporal break in the x - ray afterglow light curve . in the latter cases ( without a break ) we have defined as @xmath35 the slope that prevails beyond @xmath39s in a light curve .",
    "it should be noted here that the values of @xmath35 are consistent with those seen in previous missions since they typically started observations hours after the burst .",
    "whenever we found early ( @xmath40s ) breaks in the light curves of grbs with established redshifts , we converted them to the grb cosmological rest frame ( below , but not in table 1 ) .",
    "we have three such cases , grbs 050126 , 050315 , and 050319 , with rest frame breaks at 185 , 136 , and 87 seconds , respectively .",
    "this sample , together with grbs 050219a ( @xmath41s ) and 050422 ( @xmath42s ) , strongly point to an early x - ray afterglow light curve break , @xmath43s in the cosmological rest frame ( or @xmath4s in the observer frame ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath34 and @xmath44 ( without correcting for cosmological time dilation , since the redshift is not known for most of the grbs in our sample ) is shown in figure [ tbreaks ] .    we proceed to calculate the observed x - ray flux ( @xmath45kev ) at @xmath46hr and @xmath47hr after the grb trigger",

    "these values are listed in table 2 together with the k - corrected values of @xmath52 for each grb .",
    "the latter has been recalculated within two energy bands , the narrower of which ( @xmath64kev ) overlaps in all grbs .",
    "the wider band , ( @xmath65kev ) , is an upper limit and assumes no spectral changes from a single power law fit in the grb prompt emission .",

    "the distribution of swift events is compatible with that of earlier events measured with hete - ii and bepposax ; the combined sample is consistent with an apparent positive , roughly linear , correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath52 .",

    "we assume that @xmath67 for most grbs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for support of this idea ) .",
    "if , also , energy injection occurs in most grbs , then the observation that the ratio of @xmath68 to @xmath69 in our sample is similar to that in pre - swift grbs implies that @xmath67 for our sample as well .",
    "this suggests a high efficiency for the prompt gamma - ray emission , which is roughly constant ( albeit with large scatter ) .",
    "figure [ l_x - e_iso ] also contains a color coding for the redshift of the different events ; we note here an apparent positive correlation between @xmath52 ( or @xmath66 ) and the redshift , @xmath70 .",
    "this is likely due to observational selection effects , since , at least on average , intrinsically dimmer ( brighter ) events can be detected , their x - ray luminosity measured , and their redshift determined , out to a smaller ( larger ) redshift .",
    "the most natural explanation for the early rapid flux decay with @xmath1 is emission from _ naked grbs _",
    "@xcite , i.e. prompt grb emission ( that is usually attributed to internal shocks ) from large angles ( @xmath71 ) relative to our line of sight that reaches us at late times ( @xmath72 ) , resulting in a steep flux decay with @xmath73 .",
    "this relation is more or less satisfied in most ( though not all ) cases for which @xmath33 could be determined ( see figure [ alpha1beta1 ] ) .",
    "note also that @xcite have studied the bat and xrt spectral parameters for grbs 050315 and 050319 , and conclude that the same spectrum is consistent with both the bat burst data and the early xrt afterglow data .",
    "a somewhat steeper power law decay ( @xmath74 ) can be obtained within a few @xmath75 , where @xmath75 is the duration of the prompt emission , for the following reason .",
    "the temporal decay index of @xmath73 applies separately to each spike in the prompt light curve , as it corresponds to a collision between two sub - shells in the internal shocks models , where the emission from that collision decays as @xmath76 . here",
    "the reference time , @xmath77 , of the power - law decay corresponds to the onset of that particular spike ( i.e. the time at which the outer of the two sub - shells was ejected from the source ) .",
    "since all power law fits to the light curve take the grb trigger ( which corresponds to the onset of the first spike ) as the reference time , this would cause a seemingly steeper power law decay index for later spikes .",
    "the decay of the last spike , for which @xmath78 , will approach a power - law decay in @xmath56 for @xmath79 .",
    "this would lead to a decrease in @xmath33 with time until it approaches @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "thus , if @xmath82 , the asymptotic values of @xmath73 might not be reached . on the other hand , a shallower temporal decay index , @xmath83 , is hard to achieve in this scenario , and might require a different physical origin . in practice , however , our mostly sparse coverage of the xrt light curves at @xmath84 might lead to an underestimation of @xmath33 , since the value that is derived from the fit to the data may not represent its asymptotic value at @xmath85 .    assuming that the _ naked grb _",
    "interpretation is correct , we expect @xmath86 , or its extrapolation back in time , to smoothly join with the prompt grb emission as the emission immediately after the burst would be dominated by the tail of the last spike . at later times , @xmath87",
    ", the light curve would have contributions from the tails of all spikes with a relative weight similar to that of the spikes themselves .",
    "the bursts for which we have direct temporal overlap between the bat and xrt are consistent with a smooth connection in flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have considered 40 swift bursts with prompt xrt observations and conclude that the bat and xrt join smoothly , although in a few cases ( such as grb050219a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the smooth connection is confused by the presence of an early x - ray flare in the light curve .",
    "an interesting alternative model for the initial fast decay , that might apply at least in some cases , is reverse shock emission from large angles relative to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "this emission might be either synchrotron or synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) .",
    "the latter could suppress the flux in the optical relative to that in the x - rays @xcite , thus supporting the strict upper limits on the early optical flux that exist for some of the grbs in our sample .",
    "this interpretation would require , however , a large compton y - parameter , and in turn a very low magnetization of the grb outflow .",
    "the synchrotron component of the reverse shock emission could dominate in the x - ray range .",
    "this is theoretically possible despite the fact that the @xmath31 spectrum peaks around the optical or ir , since the @xmath88 spectrum peaks closer to the x - ray range and is fairly flat above its peak , so that a good fraction of the total emitted energy can fall within the x - ray range .",
    "finally , several other models can also be considered to explain this part of the x - ray light curve @xcite .",
    "for example , emission from the hot cocoon in the context of the collapsar model @xcite might produce a sufficiently steep flux decay , but would naturally produce a quasi - thermal spectrum which does not agree with the observed power - law spectrum .",
    "photospheric emission as the ejecta becomes optically thin @xcite is also possible as it may be able to produce significant deviations from a thermal spectrum although it is unclear how this emission would last longer than the prompt gamma - ray emission itself . @xcite",
    "have also suggested that the _ patchy shell _ model @xcite , where there are angular inhomogeneities in the outflow , might produce a sufficiently fast decay if our line of sight is within a _ hot spot _ in the jet , of angular size @xmath89 , causing a mini - jet break as the flow is decelerated by the external medium . however , this would produce @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the power law index of the electron energy distribution ) , which is significantly lower than the typical observed values of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , this would require an extreme angular inhomogeneity in the outflow .",
    "the _ patchy shell _ model , however , would naturally produce a series of bumps and wiggles in the light curve on top of a more moderate underlying power law flux decay @xcite ( rather than the observed smooth and very steep decay which later turns into a smooth and very shallow decay ) . from all the above ,",
    "we conclude that while different mechanisms might still be responsible for the steep early flux decays in the x - ray afterglows of some grbs , emission for _ naked grbs _ is the most promising mechanism , and is likely at work in most cases .      between @xmath92",
    "there is a very shallow decay of the flux , with @xmath93 .",
    "we interpret the first break , at @xmath34 , as the time when the slowly decaying emission from the forward shock becomes dominant over the rapidly decaying flux from the prompt emission at large angles from our line of sight .",
    "this break can generally be chromatic , if the spectrum of the prompt emission at large angles ( which corresponds to a larger frequency range in the local frame compared to the observed frequency during the prompt emission ) has a different spectral slope in the x - rays than the afterglow emission from the forward shock . under this interpretation",
    ", we do not expect a break in the optical ( or uv , or ir ) light curve at exactly the same time as in the x - rays ( except for the rare cases where by coincidence the spectra of these two distinct physical regions are similar over such a large range in frequencies ) .",
    "this prediction could serve as a diagnostic test for our interpretation .",
    "out of six grbs for which @xmath34 was well determined , two events ( 050315 and 050319 ) show clear evidence for a change of the spectral slope in the x - ray range , @xmath37 , across the break ( with @xmath94 of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively ) . , which supports the interpretation of _ naked grb _ emission . ] in the other four cases , while there is no evidence for a change in @xmath37 across the break , such a change can only be constrained to @xmath97 .",
    "thus we consider the observed behavior of @xmath37 across @xmath34 to be broadly consistent with our interpretation , in which @xmath98 is not expected to always be very large , and can in many cases be rather modest .",
    "the fact that the sharply decaying flux from the prompt emission initially ( at @xmath84 ) dominates over the emission from the external shock , suggests that either ( i ) the prompt emission dissipates and radiates most of the initial energy in the outflow , leaving a much smaller energy in the external shock , or ( ii ) the energy that is dissipated in the prompt emission ( i.e. the kinetic energy that is converted to internal energy ) is comparable to that in the forward shock , but the fraction of that energy which is radiated in the observed band is much larger for the prompt emission .",
    "the latter is relevant for the internal shocks model , in which at most about half ( and typically much less ) of the initial kinetic energy is expected to be converted to internal energy in the internal shocks , while most of the remaining energy ( which is expected to be close to the original energy ) is converted to internal energy in the external shock . the emission from the forward shock peaks at the deceleration time (",
    "when the ejecta slow down significantly and most of their energy is transfered to the forward shock ) , @xmath99 , which is comparable to the duration of the grb , @xmath75 , for a mildly relativistic reverse shock , so that a comparable radiative efficiency would lead to a comparable bolometric luminosity ( assuming a similar fraction of the internal energy goes to electrons and is radiated away ) .",
    "thus , the larger flux from the internal shocks suggests that a higher fraction of the internal energy is converted into radiation in the observed band . the high efficiency that is required from the prompt gamma - ray emission is further discussed in  [ alpha2 ] .      in most cases",
    "@xmath7 is too small ( @xmath100 ) to be reasonably accounted for with an adiabatic evolution of the forward shock with a constant energy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  [ tb2_alpha3 ] ) , while radiative losses would only cause a steeper flux decay .",
    "figure  [ alpha2_beta2 ] demonstrates this by showing the observed values of @xmath101 for events for which @xmath8 could be determined , along with the values expected from a spherical external shock with a constant energy .",
    "for those cases where neither adiabatic evolution or radiative losses can explain the slopes we must instead assume gradual energy injection during this part of the x - ray light curve ) . only two of the grbs reported here ( grb 050318 and 050505 ) , for which the break at @xmath8 is monitored , would be consistent with such alternative interpretations , and we have chosen the simpler characterization . ] , which can take place in two main forms : ( i ) toward the end of the burst the lorentz factor @xmath15 of the outflow that is being ejected decreases with time , forming a smooth distribution of ejected mass as a function of its lorentz factor , @xmath102 , and its corresponding energy , @xmath103 . in this picture @xmath15 increases with radius @xmath104 and material with lorentz factor @xmath15 catches up with the forward shock when the lorentz factor of the forward shock , @xmath105 , drops slightly below @xmath15 @xcite , resulting in a smooth and gradual energy injection into the afterglow shock .",
    "( ii ) an alternative scenario for the energy injection is that the central source remains active for a long time @xcite . here",
    "the ejected outflow has a lorentz factor , @xmath106 , that is much larger than that of the forward shock when it catches - up with it , @xmath107 .",
    "this leads to a more highly relativistic reverse shock ( with a lorentz factor @xmath108 ) compared to scenario ( i ) where the reverse shock is only mildly relativistic , thus resulting in a significantly different emission from the reverse shock ( which becomes similar to that from the forward shock for @xmath109 , assuming a similar composition and similar micro - physical parameters in both shocks ) .",
    "scenario ( ii ) requires the central engine to remain active for a very long time , up to @xmath8 , which is in many cases several hours ( see table 1 and figure [ tbreaks ] ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the x - ray flares in the early afterglow light curve of some grbs also suggest that the central source remains active for hours after the grb ( see  [ flares ] ) .",
    "the main difference is that scenario ( ii ) requires both smooth and continuous ( rather than episodic ) energy injection by the source at late times , and that it also requires most of the energy to be injected at late times , hours after the grb .",
    "below , we assume for simplicity that the emission in the x - ray range is dominated by the forward shock , rather than by the reverse shock , which is typically expected to be the case .    in scenario ( i ) , the power law flux decay of the x - ray afterglow suggests power law dependences of @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in order to affect the forward shock dynamics ,",
    "slow down its deceleration , and cause a shallower flux decay , the total energy in the afterglow shock should gradually increase with time .",
    ", compared to the requirement @xmath112 for the adiabatic case .",
    "for simplicity we neglect radiative losses in the following analysis . ]",
    "this implies that the total injected energy , @xmath113 , must first exceed the initial energy , @xmath114 , in the afterglow shock before it significantly affects its dynamics .",

    "is assumed below , but the results are also valid for a uniform jet ( viewed from within its aperture ) as long as the lorentz factor exceeds the inverse of the jet half - opening angle , and when the energy is replaced by the isotropic equivalent energy . for",

    "for example , in the collapsar model the late time accretion rate due to fallback is expected to scale with time as @xmath155 @xcite , which for a roughly constant efficiency , @xmath156 , implies @xmath157 and @xmath158 . for the magnetar model @xcite , @xmath159 is initially constant while after the newly born neutron star spins down significantly , @xmath160 , i.e. @xmath161 . thus , neither of these models can naturally explain the flatter flux decays at @xmath162 due to late time energy injection from the source ( see table 3 ) .",

    "we do , however , know that @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , which provide the following constraints on @xmath163 , @xmath171    the energy in the afterglow at late times ( later than several hours and therefore at @xmath172 ) is typically estimated to be comparable to or smaller than that in the prompt gamma - ray emission @xcite , even when correcting for radiative losses from the afterglow shock at early times , implying a high efficiency for the prompt emission , which is @xmath173 in most cases .",
    "this is in particular a serious problem for the internal shocks model , where it is hard to reach such high efficiencies in converting the bulk kinetic energy of the outflow to the observed gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the energy injection interpretation implies that most of the energy in the afterglow shock at late times was either ( i ) originally in material with an initial lorentz factor @xmath174 which could therefore have not contributed to the prompt gamma - ray emission ( due to the compactness problem ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or ( ii ) injected at late times , after the prompt gamma - ray emission was over .",
    "this requires the prompt gamma - ray emission to be significantly more efficient than previous estimates , where @xmath175 increases by a factor of @xmath9 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that the energy of the afterglow shock increases by a factor of @xmath163 when also taking into account radiative losses , while most previous estimates of @xmath175 included the radiative losses assuming that they decrease the energy of the afterglow shock by a factor of @xmath176 or more ( * ? ? ?",

    "another possible explanation that might be at work in at least some cases is a viewing angle slightly outside the region in the grb jet with a prominent afterglow emission @xcite .",
    "a more radical explanation might be found in the context of the cannonball model @xcite .      when energy injection ends , at @xmath172 , an adiabatic evolution of the forward shock at a constant energy follows , producing a somewhat steeper decay slope , @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the relations between the temporal and spectral indices for the power law segments of the spectrum that might be relevant in the x - rays are @xmath186    in this picture @xmath8 corresponds , for the two scenarios described in  [ alpha2 ] , respectively , to ( i ) the time when the energy injection to the forward shock ends , i.e. when the lorenz factor of the forward shock drops to slightly below the minimal lorentz factor , @xmath187 , of the ejecta which carry significant energy , or ( ii ) the time when the central source becomes inactive . under both of the energy injection scenarios , the second break ( at @xmath8 ) should be achromatic , as long as the emission before the break was dominated by the forward shock rather than by the reverse shock .",
    "if the emission before the break is dominated by the reverse shock , then there should be a brief period of fast decay of the flux ( from the reverse shock ) , as the supply of newly shocked outflow ends , and the existing shocked outflow cools adiabatically ( and radiatively ) .",

    "most flares have a very steep rise and decay ( with very large temporal rise / decay indices when fitted to a power law ) .",
    "when the flare is bright enough to follow its spectral evolution , its hardness ratio evolves during the flare , and its spectral index is somewhat different from the one associated with the underlying power law decay of the x - ray light curve before and after the flare @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fluxes before and after the flare lie approximately on the same power law decay , suggesting that the flare originates from a different physical component than that responsible for the underlying power law decay .",
    "it is very difficult ( nearly impossible under realistic conditions ) to produce very sharp temporal variations of the flux ( @xmath210 ) with large amplitudes ( @xmath211 ) in the external shock , be it from refreshed shocks on time scales @xmath212 as small as @xmath213 with @xcite , corresponding to the ratio of the radial and angular times .",

    "these three power law segments of the early x - ray light curve meet at two break times , @xmath217s , and @xmath218s .",
    "all the light curves in our sample are consistent with this basic picture of a canonical light curve , although in many cases we do not see all three power law segments , due to limited temporal coverage .",
    "the large variety of behaviors exhibited by afterglows at different times in their evolution , while clearly compatible with relativistic fireball models , poses new challenges of interpretation .",
    "we find that the most promising explanation for the initial fast flux decay ( @xmath33 ) is that it is the tail of the prompt gamma - ray emission which is emitted from large angles ( @xmath71 ) relative to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "this model produces a sharp flux decay with @xmath73 , in rough agreement with observations ( fig .",
    "[ alpha1beta1 ] ) , while @xmath74 might also be expected for @xmath219 ( see  [ alpha1 ] ) .",
    "the shallow intermediate flux decay ( @xmath7 ) is most likely caused by continuous energy injection into the forward shock .",
    "this energy injection is probably due to a decrease in the lorentz factor , @xmath15 , of the outflow toward the end of the prompt grb , resulting in a monotonic increase of @xmath15 with radius .",

    "we have deduced the values of @xmath127 from the observed x - ray light curves ( see table 3 ) and typically obtain @xmath220 .",
    "energy injection could also be caused by a long lasting activity of the central source , which keeps ejecting significant amounts of energy in a highly relativistic outflow up to several hours after the grb .",

    "furthermore , the change in the temporal index , @xmath129 , across the second break in the light curve at @xmath44 is bounded in the first scenario ( see eq .",
    "[ alpha_max ] ) but not in the second scenario . in all the grbs in our sample for which it could be tested ( perhaps with one exception , grb 050505 ) , the value of @xmath129 falls within the allowed range for the first scenario .",
    "the third power law segment of the light curve ( @xmath35 ) is most likely the well known afterglow emission from a spherical adiabatic external shock @xcite .",
    "the observed values of the temporal index ( @xmath35 ) and the spectral index ( @xmath132 ) are consistent with this interpretation ( see fig .",

    "[ diagram ] , as can be seen in the _ lower panel _ of fig .",

    "these flares are most likely caused by internal shocks within the outflow that is ejected from the central source at late times ( very close to the time when these flares are seen ) .",
    "this implies that the central source quite often remains active for hours after the grb .",
    "we find evidence for a change in the spectral slope across the first break in the light curve ( @xmath34 ) in two out of six cases for which we could determine @xmath34 .",
    "this is consistent with our interpretation in which the first break occurs when the slowly decaying emission from the forward shock becomes dominant over the steeply decaying tail emission of the prompt grb from large angles with respect to our line of sight .",
    "since these two components arise from physically distinct regions , their spectrum would generally be different .",
    "we also find no evidence for a change in the spectral slope across the second break in the light curve ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this also agrees with our interpretation that this break is caused by the end of the energy injection into the forward shock , as long as the emission before the break ( at @xmath92 ) is dominated by the forward shock ( rather than by the reverse shock ) , which is typically expected to be the case in the x - ray band .",
    "finally , the interpretation of the shallow intermediate flux decay as caused by energy injection , implies that the energy in the afterglow shock at late times ( more than several hours ) is larger than that at the deceleration time by a factor of @xmath9 ( see eq .",
