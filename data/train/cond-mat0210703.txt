    "early models of the plasma membrane , notably the fluid mosaic model @xcite postulated that transmembrane proteins were freely diffusing in a sea of lipids . during this last decade",
    ", it has become apparent that cell surface membranes are far from being homogeneous mixture of their lipid and protein components .",
    "they are compartimented into domains whose composition , physical properties and function are different .",
    "numerous studies on transmembrane proteins by means of single particle tracking ( spt ) or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) has shown the existence of micrometer and submicrometer size domains on both model membrane and living cells @xcite .",
    "_ _ recently formulated the `` matrix '' or `` skeleton fence '' model for hindered protein movements in which transmembrane proteins are coralled by a fence of cytoskeleton just beneath the membrane @xcite .",
    "frap experiments have been used for determination of long - range molecular diffusion of proteins and lipids on both model system and cells for more than 30 years @xcite .",
    "briefly , fluorescently labelled molecules localized within a predefined area are irreversibly photo - destructed by a short and intense laser pulse .",
    "the recovery of the fluorescence in this area is then measured against time . since no reversible photoreaction occurs , recovery of the fluorescence in the photobleached area is due to diffusion .",
    "frap data are generally interpreted by assuming classical brownian diffusion .",
    "two parameters can then be obtained : d , the lateral diffusion coefficient and m , the mobile fraction of the diffusing molecule .",
    "when the radius of the photobleached area is small compared to the diffusion area , m must be equal to 1 for freely diffusing species .",
    "in fact , most of the data reported so far in biological membranes for transmembrane proteins shows a value of @xmath0 .",
    "this lack in total fluorescence recovery can be interpreted as a restriction to free - diffusion behaviour .",
    "parameters obtained have then to be re - evaluated to recognize the effect of time - dependent interactions in a field of random energy barriers .",
    "membrane bound proteins should also be submitted to several interactions with their surrounding that should account for an anomalous subdiffusion behaviour .",
    "sources of restriction to free diffusion may include lipid domains trapping , binding to immobile proteins and/or obstruction by cytoskeletal elements .",
    "therefore , in this letter , diffusion of an intracellular membrane - bound protein domain ( pleckstrin homology domain ) has been analysed inside living cells by frap experiments .",
    "previous structural studies have shown that these proteins are linked to the polar head of specific lipids by means of electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the protein used in this study ( ph domain of exchange factor for arf6 ) appears to have a functional requirement to be associated to the plasma membrane within cells @xcite .",
    "after an analytical determination of the fluorescence recovery function based on an anomalous subdiffusion model , experimental recoveries obtained in living cells were analysed using random diffusion with or without an immobile fraction and compared to the analyse using time - dependent anomalous subdiffusion .",
    "a way to describe sub - diffusion is to start from a two dimensional random diffusion process .",
    "a particle walks from trap to trap and spend a certain ( random ) time in each trap .",
    "it is characterized by the following operation  : @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the two dimensional position and the age of the particle , where @xmath4 is a two dimensional random ( gaussian ) variable with variance @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the ( random ) time the particle spend in the trap .    in our model , the particle is supposed to diffuse very rapidly between two traps . this travel time",
    "is therefore neglected .",
    "the time @xmath6 the particle stays in a trap is supposed to have very strong fluctuations , this give rise to anomalous diffusion pattern .    as an example",
    "a generic distribution is used which leads , after a while , to a standard levy law in time  : @xmath7 this distribution have been used in the same type of context by naggle @xcite .",
    "the levy exponent @xmath8 is the characteristic exponent of subdiffusive behaviour . for long times we have : @xmath9    when @xmath10 a spatio - temporal fourier ( laplace ) analysis leads to the following asymptotic ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 0 ) green function  : @xmath14 where @xmath11 and @xmath15 are respectively the conjugate variables of position @xmath16 and time @xmath3 , where @xmath17 .",
    "notice that the solution of the inverse laplace transform is a function of the variable @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that the green function is a function of the variable @xmath19 . when @xmath20 is high enough one can perform an approximate inverse transformation via a saddle point method  : @xmath21 notice that the exponent @xmath22 interpolate nicely between the gaussian case ( @xmath23 ) and the exponential case .",
    "the general solution of this type of anomalous diffusion process is then  : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the probability density to find the particle at the point @xmath16 at instant @xmath3 and @xmath26 is the initial state .    as the green function is a bell - shaped fast decreasing function , one",
    "approximate it by a gaussian shape with the exact dispersion , @xmath27 , which can be calculated from eq.[l.f . ] .",
    "this permits to construct an analytical expression of the fluorescence recovery using standard properties of gaussian functions .    starting from axelrod @xcite initial density as it is immediately after a gaussian laser beam profile extinction indeed : @xmath28 ( @xmath29=photobleaching constant ,",
    "depending on experimental conditions @xcite ) and using the standard properties of the gaussian shape in the convolution operation , one can obtain the time evolved result as a serie .",
    "once integrated upon a disk of radius @xmath30 , and , after normalization to the surface of the disk , one obtain the frap signal  :    @xmath31    this function will be used to fit experimental data .",
    "+ systematic corrections of this procedure are determined using numerical monte - carlo simulations of the fluorescence recoveries , using known @xmath8 and @xmath32    a more precise study of the green function will be published later .",
    "experiments were conducted on baby hamster kidney cells ( bhk ) grown on a coverslip in cell culture medium for 2 days .",
    "cells were transfected 24 hours before the frap experiment with a pc1egfpphefa6 plasmid .",
    "this plasmid contains the sequence for both ph - efa6 domain and egfp as a fluorescent label , linked to the n - terminus of the ph - efa6 domain in order to avoid any perturbation to the membrane linkage .",
    "frap measurements were made with a commercially available confocal microscope .",
    "prebleached images were firstly acquired to ensure for the lack of photo - destruction during the observation .",
    "a brief laser pulse was then delivered to the cell ( 500ms ) .",
    "images were thereafter recorded at given intervals ( 440ms ) .",
    "the intensity ratio between the extinction laser beam and the monitoring laser beam was fixed to @xmath33 .",
    "each fluorescence recovery was recorded for 80 s at 25 c , containing 150 experimental values .",
    "focus of the laser by a 63x objective produced a gaussian intensity distibution of the beam in the object plane .",

    "in order to validate our model , monte - carlo simulation of the fluorescence recovery have been made using different values of @xmath8 and different value of @xmath34 ( see fig . [ f.1 ] ) with k=4 in every case since this value of k was the one found in frap experiments .",
    "these simulations have then been fitted using a @xmath35 order limited development of the fluorescence recovery equation established for anomalous diffusion ( eq . [ recovery ] ) .",
    "input @xmath8 of respectively 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 led to fitted value of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "absolute error measured on @xmath8 is found between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , decreasing with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "values found for @xmath34 are further from those input in our simulations ( ranging from 0.25 to 10 ) .",
    "for this reason , results were calibrated using appropriate factors for the three values of @xmath8 .",
    "a comparison of input and found values of @xmath34 as well as some correction factors are given in table [ t.1 ] .",
    "experimental fluorescence recoveries of the protein obtained in living cells ( n=17 ) were fitted by three different models ( fig.[f.2 ] ) : + - classical diffusion without restriction ( derived from eq.12 of axelrod @xcite ) .",
    "+ - classical diffusion introducing an immobile fraction m. for this model eq.12 from axelrod @xcite has been derived , leading to the following expression of @xmath41 :    @xmath42     + - time dependent anomalous diffusion ( for which the analytical fluorescence recovery has been established in the modeling section ( eq.[recovery ] ) ) .",

    "_ _ _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ t.2 ] shows that fitting the experimental curves with the classical model of axelrod led to very bad results , whereas using a limited development to the @xmath35 order of eq.([recovery ] ) and eq.([axelmob ] ) led to slightly different quality of the fit .",
    "once corrected by the previously determined factor , the calculated value of d for anomalous sub - diffusion using the expression @xmath44 gives : @xmath45 .",
    "it has to be noted that value of d found using the two models are ( intrinsically ) different",
    ". however they can be compared according the relation : @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if one estimate d(t ) at time of half recovery of fluorescence ( @xmath47 ) , as it is usually done for the estimation of d using classical diffusion model @xcite a value of @xmath48 can be found which is more than ten time higher than the value found using classical diffusion with an immobile fraction , @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper , anomalous subdiffusion in fluorescence recoveries experiments have been reexamined from the beginning . an analytical formulation of the recovery curve as a function of time",
    "have been calculated using a gaussian extinction profile .",
    "this equation has been tested by fitting monte - carlo simulated fluorescence recoveries . as already observed by feder _",
    "_ _ @xcite , @xmath8 was underestimated in the fit .",
    "this could be explain by asymptotic effects occuring because of the time - scale of the experiment @xcite .",
    "more surprinsingly , @xmath32 was also itself underestimated .",
    "this has not been underlined by feder _",
    "_ _ @xcite , but seems to be crucial for correct estimation of @xmath34 .",
    "combination of these two parameters led us to established correction factors , depending both on @xmath8 and @xmath32 to achieved measurement of @xmath34 .",
    "the experimental recoveries obtained on ph - efa6 showed that brownian diffusion without immobile fraction did not fit the data . this strongly suggest that this membrane bound protein is also submitted to restricted motion at the surface of the membrane .",
    "therefore , it was interesting to analyze the recoveries using the two limit models of restricted motion . whereas this work show that it is not possible to firmly distinguish between free - diffusion with an immobile fraction and anomalous diffusion of the entire set of proteins only by statistical considerations on the quality of the fit , estimation of @xmath34 at half time recovery obtained using anomalous diffusion ( @xmath50 ) led to a value close to that obtained for lipids in fluid - phase model membranes ( lipid bilayers without proteins ) .",
    "this value would mean that diffusion of this protein from trap to trap is mainly due to its lipid links .",
    "this hypothesis is acceptable regarding biochemical data obtained on interaction of this protein domain with lipid membrane .",
    "while analysis of spt measurements using anomalous diffusion is now becoming usual it is still difficult to elucidate its relevance in frap experiments .",
    "indeed , as a limit of the technique , frap inherently averages over a large number of particles .",
    "this could explain why anomalous diffusion model ( in which complete but restricted diffusion is allowed ) and classical brownian motion with an immobile fraction ( in which free diffusion occurs for one subpopulation and no diffusion for the other subpopulation ) lead to the same statistical quality for fitting experimental data .",
    "therefore there is still a challenge in trying to agreement spt data with frap data on biological molecules _ in situ _ _ _ .",
    "authors would like to acknowledge m. franco for kindly giving us the plasmid used for ph - efa6 expression in cell lines and m. partisani for cell culture and transfection .",
