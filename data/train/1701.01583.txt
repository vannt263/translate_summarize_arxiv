    "the milky way nuclear star cluster is the ideal object to study the dynamics of a stellar system around a supermassive black hole . at a distance of 8kpc it is close enough to resolve the individual stars , and measure discrete velocities in three dimensions . modelling the stellar kinematics can constrain the mass distribution of the star cluster , and reveal the presence of a central dark massive object . in the special case of our own galaxy , it it possible to observe keplerian orbits of stars around a dark , point - mass - like object in the galactic centre .",
    "these observations constrain this dark object to be a supermassive black hole with a mass of ( 4.1 @xmath14 0.6)@xmath4@xmath5@xcite , ( 4.3 @xmath14 0.39)@xmath4@xmath5@xcite , or ( 4.02 @xmath14 0.20)@xmath4@xmath5@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , similar high - resolution observations are not yet possible in other galaxies .",
    "already in the 1970s the requirement of a central supermassive black hole in the galactic centre was discussed to explain observational data .",
    "several studies used stellar radial velocities to constrain the mass distribution in the galactic centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also stellar proper motions were used to study the galactic centre mass distribution @xcite .",
    "several studies combined radial velocity and proper motion data @xcite . the mass distribution was derived using the spherical @xcite equations or the projected mass estimators of @xcite for spherical systems .",
    "these studies found that a central dark mass of 2@xmath155@xmath1010@xmath16@xmath5is required to explain the observations .    together with the increase of observational data ,",
    "also the modelling became more advanced .",
    "@xcite included the rotation of the nuclear star cluster in the modelling , although the rotation velocity of their data was too high @xcite . @xcite and @xcite studied the milky way nuclear star cluster using axisymmetric jeans models .",
    "@xcite showed the advantages of axisymmetric models over spherical jeans models , which can not explain the observed asymmetry of the velocity dispersion of proper motions parallel and perpendicular to the galactic plane . the nuclear star cluster appears to be flattened in its light distribution @xcite as well as in the kinematics @xcite .",
    "most studies showed that the nuclear star cluster kinematics is in agreement with isotropy @xcite , although the uncertainties are quite large ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all these models assumed a constant mass - to - light ratio for the light distribution of the cluster .    in this study",
    "we relax the assumption of axisymmetry and use triaxial orbit - based @xcite models .",
    "orbit - based models make no assumptions on the velocity anisotropy of the stellar motions , as jeans models do .",
    "further , the higher moments of the kinematics can also be included @xcite , which is important to break the degeneracy of mass and anisotropy in dynamical models .",
    "orbit - based models are commonly used to analyse line - of - sight velocity data of other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are an excellent tool to detect and measure the masses of supermassive black holes and dark matter halos . for extragalactic systems , the data are usually obtained from integrated light observations .",
    "each data point contains the accumulated kinematics of many stars , weighted by their respective brightness .",
    "however , modelling the dynamics of integrated light data may be prone to systematic uncertainties , and bias the results of the central black hole mass .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to test dynamical models on systems for which we know the central black hole mass from other independent measurements . the milky way nuclear star cluster is a good object for this kind of test",
    ". also megamaser disc galaxies are useful to validate stellar dynamical black hole measurements .",
    "black hole mass measurements from megamasers are very precise with uncertainties of only about 10 per cent . however , there is currently only one megamaser disc galaxy with a stellar dynamical black hole mass measurement @xcite , ngc 4258 .",
    "different dynamical studies found either a 15 per cent lower or a 25 per cent higher black hole mass than the maser measurement @xcite .",
    "we use the triaxial orbit - based code by @xcite to model the light distribution and line - of - sight kinematics of the milky way nuclear star cluster .",
    "we use the spectroscopic data cube constructed by @xcite for the kinematic data , and derive a surface brightness distribution using _ spitzer _ 4.5@xmath17 and naco @xmath18band images .",
    "we assume a galactocentric distance of 8kpc @xcite and a position angle 3140 east of north ( j2000.0 coordinates , @xcite ) with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we describe the kinematic and photometric data in section [ sec : datasw ] .",
    "the dynamical models are introduced in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "section [ sec : discsw ] discusses the results , and section [ sec : sumsw ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) provides constraints on the dynamical structure of stellar systems . to extract this information",
    ", we used the near - infrared @xmath19band spectroscopic data cube of @xcite , which has a pixel scale of 2.22arcsec pixel@xmath20 .",
    "we used the data cube that was cleaned of foreground stars and bright stars .",
    "the cleaned data cube contains the light of the old red giant star population .",
    "we fitted the losvd as in @xcite , i.e. on the stellar co absorption lines ( 2.2902@xmath152.365@xmath17 ) with the idl routine ppxf @xcite and the high resolution spectra of @xcite as template stars .",
    "we applied the same spatial binning as @xcite , resulting in 175 spatial bins .",
    "@xcite fitted only the velocity @xmath21 and velocity dispersion @xmath22 .",
    "however , we fitted in addition also higher moments of the losvd , in particular the gauss - hermite parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ". we added noise to each of the 175 integrated light spectra in 100 monte carlo simulation runs and obtained a distribution for each moment of the losvd .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the monte carlo distribution are taken as measurement and 1@xmath22 uncertainty of the kinematics .    since the milky way nuclear star cluster is at a distance of only 8kpc , the spectroscopic observations are spatially semi - resolved .",
    "bright stars can be resolved individually , and contribute a large fraction of the flux .",
    "for that reason we used the cleaned data cube of @xcite , where bright stars were excluded .",
    "however , the kinematic maps still show stochastic shot noise . as a consequence ,",
    "the difference of the kinematics in adjacent bins can be higher than their uncertainties , which causes problems when we model the kinematics .",
    "the stochastic noise can be mistaken for signal , and this means the best fit will be achieved by modelling the shot noise . to prevent this",
    ", we increased our kinematic uncertainties @xmath25 such that the difference of the measurement in two adjacent bins ( @xmath26 ) is less than the sum of their uncertainties ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we did this for the velocity @xmath21 , velocity dispersion @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , and find that it is required for about 68 per cent of the kinematic data uncertainties .",
    "additionally , we point - symmetrised the kinematics using the procedure of @xcite .",
    "the median uncertainties or @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are 24.6kms@xmath20 , 18.4kms@xmath20 , 0.15 , and 0.17 .",
    "our resulting kinematic maps are consistent with the maps of @xcite .",
    "we find rotation in the velocity map of approximately 50kms@xmath20and an increase in the velocity dispersion from about 65kms@xmath20towards @xmath28=135kms@xmath20at the centre .",

    "[ fig : swkindata ] , the uncertainties are shown on the bottom row .      the light distribution of the nuclear star cluster traces the stellar density .",
    "we require the two - dimensional light distribution of the red giant stars , which are our kinematic tracers .",
    "the extinction is high at optical wavelengths in the galactic centre , therefore we used near- and mid - infrared images .    for the central 40.4arcsec@xmath1040.4arcsec ( 1.6pc@xmath101.6pc )",
    "we used the high - resolution naco @xmath29-band mosaic of @xcite , which has a spatial scale of 0.027arcsecpixel@xmath20 .",
    "we preferred the @xmath29 band over the @xmath30 band in order to avoid light from gas emission lines in the @xmath30 band ( br@xmath31 and hei , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our kinematic tracers are cool late - type stars , but there are also more than 100 hot , young stars located in the centre of the cluster , within a projected radius @xmath12=0.5pc ( @xmath3212.8arcsec , @xcite ) .",
    "we masked out the young stars from the image with a 15 pixel radius .",

    "the image was smoothed to a scale of 5arcsec pixel@xmath20 , and extends over @xmath32270pc@xmath10200pc .",
    "we excluded a central circle with @xmath12=0.6pc ( @xmath3215.4arcsec ) to avoid contribution from ionised gas emission and young stars .",

    "we used the mge_fit_sectors package @xcite to derive the surface brightness distribution .",
    "the multi - gaussian - expansion model @xcite has the advantage that it can be deprojected analytically .",
    "we measured the photometry of the two images along the major axis and the minor axis .",
    "we assumed that the cluster s major axis is aligned along the galactic plane , as found by @xcite , and constant .",
    "the centre is the position of sgr  a * , which is the radio source associated with the galactic centre supermassive black hole .",
    "we fitted a scale factor to match the photometry of the two images in the region where they overlap ( 16@xmath1527.8arcsec ) .",
    "then we measured the photometry on each image along 12 angular sectors , and converted the naco photometry to the _ spitzer _ flux . assuming four - fold symmetry , the measurements of four quadrants are averaged on elliptical annuli with constant ellipticity .",

    "a possible reason is the small overlap region of the _ spitzer _ and naco images , and that the _ spitzer _",
    "flux could be too high at the centre .",
    "maybe the pah emission correction of the _ spitzer _ image was too low .",
    "the mid - infrared dust emission is significant out to almost one arcmin .",

    "all three changes influence only the central part of the surface brightness distribution , as ionised gas emission and light from young stars are only important in the central parsec .",
    "the surface brightness profile is deprojected to obtain the three - dimensional spatial stellar light distribution . in general , the deprojection of a surface brightness profile is non - unique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "orbit - based models or schwarzschild models are a useful tool to model the dynamics of stellar systems by orbit superposition .",
    "the first step of schwarzschild s method is to integrate the equations of motion for a representative library of stellar orbits in a gravitational potential @xmath39",
    ". then the observables for each orbit are computed , considering projection , psf convolution and pixel binning .",
    "the next step is to find orbital weights to combine the orbits such that they reproduce the observed data .",
    "schwarzschild models are a powerful tool to recover the intrinsic kinematical structure and the underlying gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader for further details to @xcite for implementation and @xcite for verification of the triaxial schwarzschild code .",
    "we calculated orbits in the combined gravitational potential of a supermassive black hole @xmath40 and the star cluster @xmath41 , inferred from the imaging data .",
    "as we run triaxial models , there are three intrinsic shape parameters , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , for the cluster .",

    "they are defined as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the length of the longest axis @xmath45 projected on the sky .",
    "thus , @xmath44 represents the compression of @xmath45 due to projection on the sky .",
    "each set of axial ratios refers to a set of viewing angles ( @xmath52 , see also @xcite ) .",

    "besides the considered stellar population and the supermassive black hole , there are other components within the nuclear star cluster , which we neglected .",
    "we measured a dynamical mass - to - light ratio , which combines the stellar mass - to - light ratio with other components .",
    "these components are the young stars , ionised gas , neutral gas , and dark matter .",
    "the young stars are at a distance of about 0.5pc from the supermassive black hole .",
    "the lower limit of the total mass of young stars is 12000@xmath5 .",
    "however , the total enclosed extended mass in the same region is @xmath3210@xmath16@xmath5 @xcite , and the mass of the supermassive black hole is 4@xmath1010@xmath16@xmath5 .",
    "the mass of the young stars is therefore probably negligible .",
    "the hot ionised gas has a mass of only a few 100@xmath5 @xcite , and can not influence the stellar dynamics significantly .",
    "the neutral gas in the circum - nuclear disc may contribute more mass , estimates range from 10@xmath56@xmath5 to 10@xmath16@xmath5 @xcite , though this is probably the upper limit @xcite .",

    "the total enclosed mass is @xmath3210@xmath11@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we decided to neglect the mass distribution of the circum - nuclear disc in our dynamical models , since it is very uncertain , and makes up only 0.1 to 10 per cent of the enclosed mass .",
    "the contribution of dark matter to the nuclear star cluster mass is also neglected .",

    "we assumed that the orbits are regular and that three integrals of motion , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , are conserved .",

    "it is difficult to predict how our results would change in a rotating model",
    ". the inferred orbital structure will be affected ( depending on the tumbling speed of the nuclear star cluster ) , but our results on the mass distribution are likely to be fairly robust , as the assumption of a constant mass - to - light ratio is probably more important .",
    "we constructed for the first time triaxial orbit - based schwarzschild models of the milky way nuclear star cluster .",

    "there are several possible ways to extend the dynamical models in the future .",
    "one way is to include a component for the neutral gas disc inside the nuclear star cluster .",
