    "a solvable continuous - time stochastic process can be defined as a process for which the transition probability density function is obtainable in analytically closed - form .",
    "this kind of solvability permits us to precisely simulate paths of the process from its exact sample distribution .",
    "another important benefit is that some standard methods such as spectral expansions can be applied to obtain closed - form analytical formulas for the transition densities of regular as well as killed solvable diffusions . as a result of that",
    ", one can derive other fundamental quantities such as first - hitting time distributions as is done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the set of diffusion processes that are , on the one hand , tractable and applicable for mathematical modelling and , on the other hand , exactly solvable is not so vast .",
    "this set includes mostly linear diffusion processes or diffusions with power nonlinearity ( see @xcite and @xcite for a comprehensive review of such diffusions ) .",
    "there are two main tools that allow us to construct new solvable diffusion processes .",
    "the first is related to a measure change on a chosen underlying diffusion and the second involves a change of variable or smooth monotonic mapping ( the it formula ) . in recent years , a new approach that combines special measure changes with nonlinear variable transformations was introduced for uncovering various new families of exactly solvable _ driftless _ diffusion models  @xcite .",
    "the method has been coined as `` diffusion canonical transformation '' , partly in light of the fact that a diffusion process is reduced , or mapped , onto another underlying ( simpler ) diffusion process . in subsection  [ subsect1.1 ]",
    "we state the standard green s function methodology and provide the basic background formalism and general assumptions that define the underlying diffusions .",
    "subsection  [ subsect1.2 ] presents the diffusion canonical transformation method .",
    "detailed discussions of other canonical aspects of the transformation methodology can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discover that a relatively simple change in the nonlinear variable transformation allows us to construct a whole new class of diffusions @xmath0 with linear drift and nonlinear diffusion coefficient functions defined by the time - homogeneous stochastic differential equation ( sde ) of the form @xmath1 . as a result of our study ,",
    "we upgrade three main families of time - homogeneous diffusions named as _",
    "bessel , confluent hypergeometric , and ornstein - uhlenbeck _ families .",
    "these processes , which we also refer to as @xmath2-diffusions , arise via the diffusion canonical transformation method by respectively choosing the standard squared bessel process , cir process , and ornstein - uhlenbeck process as underlying diffusions ( see section  [ sect3 ] ) .",
    "it is important that these three families include and recover all the corresponding families of _ driftless _ diffusions obtained previously in @xcite as special subfamilies .",
    "moreover , the new affine models inherit some of the important salient properties of their driftless counterparts .",
    "one immediate application of such diffusions is asset pricing in finance ( when @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a constant interest rate ) . in @xcite , we show that these three families generate local volatility profiles with varied pronounced smiles and skews . moreover , we prove that there exists a risk - neutral measure so that the driftless asset price process is a martingale .",
    "option pricing under these models is straightforward and is well studied in @xcite .",
    "clearly , pricing of european options is reduced to the evaluation of a definite integral .",
    "since the first - hitting time distributions for killed solvable diffusions is available in the form of a spectral expansion , no - arbitrage prices of barrier and lookback options are available in closed form as well . as well ,",
    "discretely - monitored path - dependent options can be evaluated by using a path integral approach . in doing ,",
    "so we use one important observation that the distribution of a bridge asset price process is reduced to the distribution of the corresponding underlying bridge diffusion ( e.g. the bessel , cir , or ornstein - uhlenbeck bridge processes ) .",
    "moreover , subfamilies of diffusions belonging to the bessel and confluent hypergeometric families admit absorption at a boundary point , so they can naturally be used in derivatives pricing under credit risk .",
    "last , but not least , the newly developed @xmath2-diffusions are also applicable to interest rate modelling .",
    "although the diffusions with affine drift @xmath5 considered here are not mean - reverting , they still can be useful as short - term interest rate models thanks to the nonlinear local volatility function .",
    "alternatively , by using a suitable change of variable , we are able to obtain models with nonlinear mean - reversion that permit closed - form solutions for valuing zero - coupon bonds",
    ".    one of the main contributions of this paper ( in comparison with @xcite and references therein ) is the analysis and classification of allowable mapping functions that lead to _ new diffusions with affine drift_. subsection  [ subsect1.3 ] presents some results for proving the smooth monotonicity property of mappings that lead to @xmath2-diffusions with affine drift where @xmath6 .",
    "another main result , presented in subsection  [ subsect1.4 ] , is the complete boundary classification of such newly constructed regular diffusions .",
    "finally , we analyse whether or not such diffusions @xmath0 `` preserve '' the drift rate , i.e. whether @xmath7=\\mathsf{e}[a + bf_t\\mid f_t]$ ] , @xmath8 holds . this property can be viewed as a generalization of the martingale property for _ driftless _ processes , where @xmath9=f_t$ ] , @xmath10 and , therefore , @xmath11=0 $ ] holds .",
    "therefore , for the special case with @xmath3 we prove that the discounted asset price process @xmath12 is a martingale . with the aim to provide a rigorous framework for the above characterizations of the families of @xmath2-diffusions , in section  [ sect2 ] we present a theorem that state easy - to - implement limit ( asymptotic ) conditions for verifying the conservation of the expectation rate of the @xmath2-diffusions .",
    "in section  [ sect4 ] we apply the theory of section  [ sect1 ] and section  [ sect2 ] to the above - named three chosen underlying solvable diffusions defined in section  [ sect3 ] . in doing so , we give a construction , probabilistic classification and analysis of the resulting new three families of @xmath2-diffusion models . in section  [ subsect4.2 ]",
