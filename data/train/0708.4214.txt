    "* * c**ooperative communication has been a promising means of achieving spatial diversity without the need of multiple antennas at the individual nodes in a wireless network .",
    "the idea is based on the relay channel model , where a set of distributed antennas belonging to multiple users in the network co - operate to encode the signal transmitted from the source and forward it to the destination so that the required diversity order is achieved , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "spatial diversity obtained from such a co - operation is referred to as co - operative diversity . in @xcite ,",
    "the idea of space - time coding devised for point to point co - located multiple antenna systems is applied for a wireless relay network and is referred to as distributed space - time coding .",
    "the technique involves a two phase protocol where , in the first phase , the source broadcasts the information to the relays and in the second phase , the relays linearly process the signals received from the source and forward them to the destination such that the signal at the destination appears as a space - time block code .",
    "+ since the work of @xcite-@xcite , lot of efforts have been made to generalise the various aspects of space - time coding proposed for multiple antenna systems to the co - operative setup .",
    "one such important aspect is the design of low - complexity maximum likelihood ( ml ) decodable distributed space - time block codes ( dstbcs ) - in particular , the design of single - symbol ml decodable ( ssd ) dstbcs . for a background on ssd stbcs for mimo systems ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite - @xcite . through out the report , we consider dstbcs that are ml decodable .",
    "two group decodable dstbcs were introduced in @xcite through doubling construction using a commuting set of matrices from field extensions . in @xcite ,",
    "orthogonal designs ( ods ) and quasi - orthogonal designs @xcite originally proposed for multiple antenna systems have been applied to the co - operative framework . since the co - variance matrix of additive noise at the destination is a function of ( i ) the realisation of the channels from the relays to the destination and ( ii ) the relay matrices , complex orthogonal designs ( except for 2 relays - alamouti code ) loose their ssd property in the co - operative setup . in @xcite , dstbcs based on co - ordinate",
    "interleaved orthogonal designs @xcite have been introduced which have reduced decoding complexity . in this set - up",
    ", the source performs co - ordinate interleaving of information symbols before transmitting to the relays . in @xcite ,",
    "low decoding complexity dstbcs were proposed using clifford - algebras , wherein the relay nodes are assumed to have the knowledge of the phase component of the source to relay channel .",
    "a class of four - group decodable dstbcs was also proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ recently , in @xcite , distributed orthogonal space - time codes ( dostbcs ) achieving single - symbol decodability have been introduced for co - operative networks .",
    "the authors considered a special class of dostbcs which make the covariance matrix of the additive noise vector at the destination , a diagonal one and such a class of codes was referred to as row monomial dostbcs .",
    "upper - bounds on the maximum symbol - rate ( in complex symbols per channel use ) of row monomial dostbcs have been derived and a systematic construction of such codes has been proposed.the constructed codes were shown to meet the upperbound for even number of relays . in @xcite ,",
    "the same authors have derived an upperbound on the symbol - rate of dostbcs when the additive noise at the destination is correlated .",
    "it is shown that the improvement in the rate is not significant when compared to the case when the noise at the destination is uncorrelated @xcite .",
    "+ in @xcite and @xcite , ssd dstbcs have been studied when the relay nodes are assumed to know the corresponding channel phase information .",
    "an upper bound on the symbol rate for such a set up is shown to be @xmath2 which is independent of the number of relays .",
    "+ in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite the source node transmits the information symbols to all the relays with out any processing . on the similar lines of @xcite and using the framework proposed in @xcite , in this report , we propose ssd dstbcs aided by linear precoding of the information vector at the source . in our set - up",
    ", we assume that the relay nodes do not have the knowledge of the channel from the source to itself .",
    "in particular , it is shown that , co - ordinate interleaving of information symbols at the source along with the appropriate choice of relay matrices , ssd dstbcs with maximal rates higher than that of dostbcs can be constructed .",
    "the contributions of this report can be summarized as follows :    * a new class of dstbcs called precoded dstbcs ( pdstbcs ) ( definition [ def_pdstbc ] ) is introduced where the source performs co - ordinate interleaving of information symbols appropriately before transmitting it to all the relays . within this class , we identify codes that are ssd and refer to them as precoded distributed single symbol decodable stbcs ( pdssdcs ) ( definition [ d_pdssd ] ) .",
    "the well known dostbcs studied in @xcite are shown to be a special case of pdssdcs . * a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the relay matrices for the existence of pdssdcs is proved ( lemma [ necc_suf_cond ] ) . * within the set of pdssdcs , a class of semi - orthogonal pdssdcs ( s - pdssdc ) ( definition [ d_so_updssd ] ) is defined .",
    "the known dostbcs are shown to belong to the class of s - pdssdcs .",
    "on the similar lines of @xcite , a special class of s - pdssdcs having a diagonal covariance matrix at the destination is studied and are referred to as row monomial s - pdssdcs .",
    "an upper bound on the maximal symbol - rate of row monomial s - pdssdcs is derived .",
    "it is shown that , the symbol rate of row monomial s - pdssdc is upper - bounded by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , when the number of relays , @xmath1 is of the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , where @xmath7 is any natural number .",
    "the bounds obtained are approximately twice larger than that of dostbcs . * a systematic construction of row - monomial s - pdssdcs",
    "is presented when @xmath0 .",
    "codes achieving the upper - bound on the symbol rate are constructed when @xmath1 is 0 modulo 4 or 3 modulo 4 . for the rest of the values of @xmath1 , the constructed s - pdssdcs",
    "are shown to have rates higher than that of the dostbcs .",
    "* precoding of information symbols at the source has resulted in the construction of high rate s - pdssdcs . in this setup",
    ", the relays do not perform co - ordinate interleaving of the received symbols .",
    "it is shown that , when the source transmits information symbols to all the relays with out any precoding , and if the relays are allowed to perform linear processing of their received vector , s - pdssdcs other than dostbcs can not be constructed thereby , necessitating the source to perform coordinate interleaving of information symbols in order to construct high rate s - pdssdcs .",
    "the remaining part of the report is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , along with the signal model , pdstbcs are introduced and a special class of it called pdssdcs is defined .",
    "a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the relay matrices for the existence of pdssdcs is also derived . in section [ sec3 ] , s - pdssdcs",
    "are defined and a special class of it called row - monomial s - pdssdcs are studied .",
    "an upper bound on the maximal rate of row - monomial s - pdssdcs is derived . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "construction of row - monomial s - pdssdcs is presented along with some examples . in section [ sec5 ] , we show that the source has to necessarily perform precoding of information symbols in order to construct high rate s - pdssdcs . the problem of designing two - dimensional signal sets for the full diversity of rs - pdssdcs is discussed in section [ sec6 ] along with some simulation results .",
