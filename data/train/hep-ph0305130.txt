    "one of the fundamental ideas of modern cosmology is that there was an epoch early in the history of the universe when potential , or vacuum , energy dominated other forms of energy densities such as matter or radiation . during such a vacuum - dominated era",
    "the scale factor grew exponentially ( or nearly exponentially ) in some small time . during this phase , dubbed inflation @xcite , a small , smooth spatial region of size of order the hubble radius grew so large that it easily could encompass the comoving volume of the entire presently observable universe .",
    "if the universe underwent such a period of rapid expansion , one can understand why the observed universe is homogeneous and isotropic to such high accuracy .",
    "one of the predictions of the simplest models of inflation is a spatially flat universe , _",

    "metric perturbations at the surface of last scattering are observable as temperature anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "the first and most impressive confirmation of the inflationary paradigm came when the cmb anisotropies were detected by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite in 1992 @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) .    despite the simplicity of the inflationary paradigm ,",
    "the number of inflation models that have been proposed in the literature is enormous @xcite .",
    "this is true even if we limit ourselves to models with only one scalar field ( the _ inflaton _ ) . with the previous data on cmb anisotropies from balloon and terrestrial experiments it has been possible for the first time to place interesting constraints on the space of possible inflation models @xcite",
    "however , the quality of the data were not good enough to rule out entire classes of models .",
    "a boost along these lines has been very recently provided by the data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) mission , which has marked the beginning of the precision era of the cmb measurements in space @xcite .",

    "[ fig_like ] , there is no correlation between the tensor component and the running of the scalar index .",

    "note in particular the wide range of inflationary energy scales compatible with the observational constraint .",
    "this is to be expected , since there was no detection of tensor modes in the wmap data , which would be seen here as a detection of a nonzero tensor / scalar ratio @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the _ shape _ of the inflationary potential is also not well constrained by wmap .",
    "figure [ fig_like_zoo ] shows the models sampled by the monte carlo categorized by their `` zoology '' , _",

    "figures [ fig_v_zoo ] , [ fig_v_zoo_type ] , and [ fig_v_zoo_type_rescaled ] show the reconstructed potentials divided by type .",
    "perhaps the only conclusion to be drawn here is that the wmap data places no significant constraint on the shape of the inflationary potential ; many `` reasonable '' potentials are consistent with the data .",
    "however , significant portions of the observable parameter space are ruled out by wmap , and future observations can be expected to significantly tighten these constraints @xcite .    for the particular example of @xmath161 , using eq .",
    "[ eqphi4obs ] we find that this choice of potential ruled out to @xmath3 only for @xmath234 for the wmap data set .",
    "this constraint is even weaker than that claimed by barger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , most likely because we allow for a running of the spectral index in our constraint .",
    "when augmenting the wmap data set with the data from seven other cmb experiments , the most noticeable improvement in the constraints is a better upper limit to the tensor / scalar ratio @xmath6 , which results in a slightly improved upper limit on the height of the potential .",
    "also , the width of the reconstructed potentials in planck units is somewhat less than in the case of the wmap - only constraint , showing that the additional data more strongly limit the form of the inflationary potential .",
    "the combined data rules out a potential with @xmath161 for @xmath235 to @xmath3 , effectively killing such models as observationally viable candidates for the inflaton potential .",
    "in this paper , we presented an analysis of the wmap data set with an emphasis on parameters relevant for distinguishing among the various possible models for inflation .",
    "in contrast to previous analyses , we confined ourselves to cmb data only and performed a likelihood analysis over a grid of models including the full error covariance data from the wmap satellite alone , and in conjunction with measurements from boomerang-98 , maxima-1 , dasi , cbi , acbar , vsae , and archeops .",
    "we found that the wmap data alone are consistent with a scale - invariant power spectrum , @xmath53 , with no running of the spectral index , @xmath236 .",
    "however , a great number of models indicates a compatibility of the data with a blue spectral index and a substantial negative running .",
    "this is consistent with the result published by the wmap team including data from large - scale structure measurements and the lyman-@xmath8 forest .",
    "the wmap result is also consistent with previous cmb experiments .",
    "the inclusion of previous datasets in the analysis has the effect of reducing the error bars and give a better determination of the inflationary parameters .",
    "still , no clear evidence for the running is present in the combined analysis .",
    "this result differs from the result obtained in peiris _",
    "et al . _  in the case of combined ( wmap+cbi+acbar ) analysis , where a mild ( about @xmath237 ) evidence for running was reported .",
    "the different and more conservative method of analysis adopted here , and the larger cmb dataset used in our paper can explain this difference .",
    "in addition , we applied the monte carlo reconstruction technique to generate an ensemble of inflationary potentials consistent with observation .",
    "of the three basic classes of inflation model , small - field , large - field , and hybrid , none are conclusively ruled out , although hybrid models are favored by the best fit region .",
    "the reconstruction process indicates that a wide variety of smooth potentials for the inflaton are consistent with the data , indicating that the wmap result is too crude to significantly constrain either the height or the shape of the inflaton potential .",
    "in particular , the lack of evidence for tensor fluctuations makes it impossible to constrain the energy scale at which inflation takes place .",
    "nonetheless , wmap rules out a large portion of the available parameter space for inflation , itself a significant improvement over previous measurements . for the particular case of a potential of the form @xmath238 , wmap rules out",
    "all such potentials for @xmath234 at the @xmath3 level , which means that @xmath239 potentials are not conclusively ruled out by wmap alone .",
    "the combined data set , however , rules out @xmath239 models for @xmath235 , which kills such potentials as viable candidates for inflation .",

    "<S> we extract parameters relevant for distinguishing among single - field inflation models from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data set , and from a combination of the wmap data and seven other cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we use only cmb data and perform a likelihood analysis over a grid of models including the full error covariance matrix . we find that a model with a scale - invariant scalar power spectrum ( @xmath0 ) , no tensor contribution , and no running of the spectral index , is within the 1-@xmath1 contours of both data sets . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply the monte carlo reconstruction technique to both data sets to generate an ensemble of inflationary potentials consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> none of the three basic classes of inflation models ( small - field , large - field , and hybrid ) are completely ruled out , although hybrid models are favored by the best - fit region . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction process indicates that a wide variety of smooth potentials for the inflaton are consistent with the data , implying that the first - year wmap result is still too crude to constrain significantly either the height or the shape of the inflaton potential . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the lack of evidence for tensor fluctuations makes it impossible to constrain the energy scale of inflation . nonetheless , the data rule out a large portion of the available parameter space for inflation . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we find that potentials of the form @xmath2 are ruled out to @xmath3 by the combined data set , but not by the wmap data taken alone . </S>"
