    "the standard model is unsatisfactory from an aesthetic viewpoint .",
    "even though the model has very good agreement with experimental results , the matter content appears to be too complicated to be the most fundamental structure of the universe .",
    "this unsatisfactory point can be stated in a more scientific way . despite the complicated matter content in the model , after summing over their contributions , the quantum anomaly cancels miraculously .",
    "this miraculous cancellation has to be explained . considering that the periodic table of the chemical elements finally led to the discovery of the subatomic structure and that the representation - theoretical diagrams of hadrons led to the discovery of quarks",
    ", it is natural to expect a more fundamental structure beyond the standard model .",
    "a fundamental structure was proposed as the grand unified theory ( gut ) @xcite .",
    "for example , if we regard the standard model gauge group @xmath7 as @xmath8 and continue the unification in the exceptional algebras of the @xmath9-series , we find that the matter content of each generation is unified into a few multiplets or a single multiplet in @xmath10 or @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in the @xmath0 unification @xcite , the seemingly redundant fields in the fundamental representation @xmath12 are useful for explaining the hierarchical structure of the quark - lepton masses and mixings in the standard model in a simple way @xcite models . ] . reviewing all of these beautiful unifications",
    ", it seems reasonable to anticipate the emergence of an @xmath9-series structure independent of the details of models .",
    "it is also natural to require four - dimensional @xmath13 supersymmetry ( susy ) to enforce the gauge - coupling unification and adjoint higgs fields to enable symmetry breaking in this context .",
    "string theory is another candidate fundamental structure which also unifies gravity . among the known frameworks for phenomenological studies of string theory @xcite ,",
    "heterotic string theory @xcite matches particularly well with the @xmath9-series and has a well - defined lagrangian description .",
    "therefore , aside from any further specific phenomenological requirements , it is interesting to ask whether we can find unified models with    * an @xmath0 unification group , * higgs fields in the adjoint representation , * three generations , * four - dimensional @xmath13 susy ,    from heterotic string theory .    in the construction of phenomenological models in heterotic string theory ,",

    "the orbifold action @xmath16 is basically defined for the target space , @xmath17 , with a clear geometric picture . in terms of its world - sheet theory , the action is common for the left - movers @xmath18 and right - movers @xmath19 of the string coordinates . in the case of heterotic string where fermions are only right - moving",
    ", the orbifold action @xmath16 is extended to act on the left - moving @xmath14 or @xmath15 lattice to compensate the asymmetry .",
    "it has been found , however , that in these compactifications it is difficult to find unified models with the above requirements .",
    "considering that the orbifold action can be generalized so as to also act on the extra left - moving lattice , it is natural to generalize the orbifold action further so that it acts on the left - moving and right - moving lattices separately .",
    "this type of construction is called an asymmetric orbifold @xcite .",
    "namely , in asymmetric orbifolds , the action can be defined independently on the left - movers and right - movers , @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in general , the starting point is not necessarily restricted to the @xmath22 or @xmath15 heterotic theory but may include heterotic theory compactified on a general lorentzian even self - dual lattice @xcite , which combines the geometric six dimensions and the extra left - moving 16 dimensions together from the beginning . since , in this paper , we describe even self - dual lattices using lie lattices , asymmetric orbifold actions are defined as orbifold identifications of discrete symmetries of these lie lattices .",
    "compared with symmetric orbifolds , asymmetric orbifolds offer many more possibilities for model construction since there are many possible even self - dual lattices and asymmetric orbifold actions , although the consistency condition is more complicated .",
    "a thorough study on heterotic asymmetric orbifolds in @xcite showed that such construction of @xmath0 guts is actually possible .",
    "the authors of @xcite claimed that , under the additional requirement of a hidden non - abelian gauge group for susy breaking @xcite , only one model with the above physical requirements exists . since",
    ", however , it is known that there are other possibilities for breaking the susy such as that in @xcite , in which our world is realized in a metastable vacuum @xcite , the requirement of the hidden non - abelian gauge group may be relaxed to construct new models . in addition , unfortunately there are no mechanisms to prevent the doublet - triplet splitting problem and the susy flavor / cp problem in their unique model in @xcite .",
    "considering possible solutions to the problems utilizing additional gauge symmetries such as the anomalous @xmath23 gauge symmetry @xcite and @xmath24 family symmetry @xcite , it is worth checking whether or not such additional symmetries can be realized in these new models .",
    "we revisited this direction in @xcite , where we systematically translated the above four physical requirements into a setup in string theory . as a result",
    ", we found three models with one of them having the same massless spectrum as that in @xcite and two of them being new .",
    "surprisingly , we found that one of the new models contained a further hidden non - abelian gauge group and was dropped from the classification in @xcite .",
    "in addition to these explicitly constructed models , we stress that the techniques used in @xcite are now well established and we can construct many types of models at will .",
    "unfortunately , our new models share the same phenomenologically unsatisfactory issues as the model in @xcite . despite this",
    ", we believe that our discovery of new @xmath0 models in a systematic way is important because it raises hopes that more phenomenologically attractive models will be found .    in the current paper , we present details of the model construction in @xcite using partition functions in a self - contained way .",
    "the techniques used include the lattice engineering technique @xcite , modular invariance with arbitrary shift actions and the diagonal embedding method @xcite with a shift action .",
    "as explained in @xcite , various physical requirements can be translated into the string setup using the above techniques .",
    "note that , although we have applied these techniques to @xmath0 gut model construction in this study , the same techniques can be used for constructing models with other unified gauge symmetries such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 and the standard model group @xmath7 .",

    "note that this technique is merely a mathematical tool for finding new even self - dual lattices and is unconnected with whether or not we can construct a heterotic string theory from it .    at this stage",
