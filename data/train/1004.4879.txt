    "elastic capsules constitute an important class within soft matter research both from a fundamental and application point of view @xcite .",
    "in contrast to strongly deformable fluid vesicles @xcite , the membrane of capsules exhibits finite shear elasticity .",
    "this structural feature is achieved either by chemically or physically crosslinking the molecules forming the membrane @xcite or by attaching a polymeric network to a fluid membrane as in red blood cells ( rbcs ) @xcite . from the perspective of this paper",
    "these biological capsules can be subsumed under this heading of a micro - capsule as well .",
    "promising applications of these objects arise _ interalia _ from the pharmaceutical perspective of optimized drug encapsulation delivery and release @xcite .    in a microfluidic context ,",
    "one of the most relevant issues is the behaviour of these soft objects in externally applied flow .",
    "this problem is challenging from a theoretical perspective since the shape of the capsule is not given _ a priori _ but determined dynamically from a balance of interfacial forces with fluid stresses .",
    "hence , their deformation will depend on their material properties and the type of external flow .    before reviewing the state of the art concerning theory and experiment in the next two sections , we set the stage by introducing a few key notions for micro - capsule dynamics .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : phasedef ] , we consider the dynamics of a single closed elastic membrane that surrounds an inner fluid with viscosity @xmath0 and is embedded in an ambient flow with viscosity @xmath1 , thereby defining an important quantity , the viscosity contrast @xmath2 . in the absence of the capsule",
    "we assume a prescribed external flow , in most cases set to be an infinite linear shear flow .",
    "for all experimental setups the reynolds number is small , i.e.  dissipation is dominating and inertial effects are negligible .",
    "consequently , the flow is governed by the linear stokes equations and determined instantaneously by the boundary conditions , where in all cases a no - slip boundary condition is assumed at the membrane .    for describing the capsule state adequately ,",
    "we define a set of suitable parameters .",
    "capsules and rbcs consist of a thin membrane with a typical thickness in the nanometer range which encloses a fluid on a larger length scale ( typically of the order 1 - 100 @xmath3 m ) with fixed volume @xmath4 defining a length scale @xmath5 as the radius of a sphere with the same volume @xmath6 for capsules with area elasticity , the area @xmath7 of the membrane , as well as the excess area @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 can change , where @xmath10 corresponds to a sphere . in contrast , the membrane of rbcs and polymerized vesicles has a vanishingly small area compressibility , i.e.  @xmath7 and @xmath11 are constants . for these area - incompressible objects ,",
    "shape changes are only possible for initially non - spherical shapes @xmath12 .    in most cases considered in this paper ,",
    "the capsule is roughly ellipsoidal , see figure  [ fig : phasedef ] for a definition of the geometry .",
    "the three main dynamical parameters are ( i ) the inclination angle @xmath13 between the direction of the shear flow and the long semi - axis , ( ii ) the phase angle @xmath14 measuring the angle between the direction of the shear flow and that of the position of a tracer particle which initially was on the endpoint of the long semi - axis and ( iii ) the taylor deformation parameter @xmath15 expressed by the lengths of the two semi - axes in the shear plane . for",
    "initially spherical capsules the deformation parameter @xmath16 grows with increasing shear rate , while @xmath16 reaches a plateau value for capsules with incompressible membrane area at large shear rate .    , @xmath17 , @xmath18 in linear shear flow @xmath19 .",
    "the shear plane defines the @xmath20 plane with shear flow pointing into the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the coordinate axes @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 point along the principal directions of the capsule where the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes , with @xmath25 , are chosen to lie in the shear plane and are rotated through the inclination angle @xmath13 with respect to the @xmath21 and @xmath26 axes . the phase angle @xmath14 measures the angle between the direction of the shear flow and the direction of a tracer particle which initially was on the endpoint of the long semi - axis @xmath27 .",
    "the phase angle @xmath28 measures the tank - treading motion of the membrane by the angle between the position of the tracer particle with respect to its undeformed position .",
    "the membrane encloses a fluid of viscosity @xmath0 and volume @xmath4",
    ". the fluid outside the capsule has viscosity @xmath1.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]     while the membrane performs a tank - treading motion with monotonously decreasing phase angle @xmath29 . in the tumbling motion",
    "the inclination angle @xmath13 steadily decreases leading to a flipping motion of the capsule and an oscillating phase angle @xmath29.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   while the membrane performs a tank - treading motion with monotonously decreasing phase angle @xmath29 . in the tumbling motion",
    "the inclination angle @xmath13 steadily decreases leading to a flipping motion of the capsule and an oscillating phase angle @xmath29.,title=\"fig : \" ]    two main modes of motion of capsules in shear flow can be identified as illustrated in figure  [ fig : phenomenology ] : ( i ) the capsule shape reaches a stationary state in the laboratory frame .",
    "the membrane elements rotate along the fixed shape like the chains of a tank .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath13 is then constant , while the phase angle @xmath29 grows monotonously .",
    "such a motion is called tank - treading in its pure form .",
    "a variant of this motion with slightly oscillating inclination angle is called swinging and will become important later in this paper .",
    "( ii ) the capsule shape rotates in the laboratory frame as a rigid body would do . in this case",
    "the inclination angle @xmath13 grows monotonously , while the phase angle @xmath29 stays approximately constant .",
    "this motion is called tumbling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give an overview over the theoretical methods in section  [ sec : theor - appr ] .",
    "we then summarize the experimental developments in section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "the formation of short - wavelength wrinkles on the surface of polymerized capsules is discussed in section  [ sec : wrinkling ] .",
    "we then focus on the dynamics of non - spherical capsules in section [ sec : reducedmodel ] , where we find the predictions of a simple analytical theory at odds with numerical evidence . to solve this discrepancy in the main original contribution of this paper , we systematically expand the equations of motion in the limit of small capsule deformations in section  [ sec : syst - quasi - spher ] .",
    "we find that in certain dynamic regimes shape changes , which are not covered by the simple theory , play an important role in the capsule dynamics .",
    "we finish by discussing a few perspectives in section  [ sec : perspectives ] .",
    "details of the analytical methods and longer derivations are deferred to appendices  a  c .",
    "from a theoretical point of view , the full equations of motion are intractable analytically .",
    "however , much insight into the physics can be obtained by either studying certain asymptotic limits , where the dynamics can be simplified , or by restricting the number of degrees of freedom to as few as possible .",
    "an example of the first strategy is the quasi - spherical expansion of the equations of motion for initially spherical capsules as shown in the following section  [ sec : init - spher - caps ] .",
    "the keller - skalak model @xcite ( described in detail in section [ sec : keller - skalak ] ) follows the second strategy , by artificially fixing the shape of the capsule and only allowing tank - treading and tumbling degrees of freedom . in its original form",
    "this model is only applicable for fluid vesicles although it was intended to describe rbcs .",
    "it is missing an important energetic contribution to the dynamics , the so - called shape memory @xcite .",
    "the origin of this term is discussed in section  [ sec : shape - memory - effect ] .",
    "an extension of the keller - skalak model including the shape memory effect @xcite is described in detail in section  [ sec : skotheim - secomb ] . beyond these two approaches ,",
    "numerical methods are inevitable . in section [ sec : numerics ] , we give an overview of the different numerical approaches that have been developed and successfully used to determine the dynamics of vesicles , capsules and rbcs .",
    "often the shape of the capsule deviates only little from a sphere .",
    "similarly , in weak flow , initially spherical capsules only deviate slightly from their equilibrium shape .",
    "the highly non - linear equations of motion can then be expanded in terms of the small deformation vector field .",
    "one can then take further advantage of the high symmetry of a sphere by changing to a spherical harmonic representation .",
    "a comprehensive treatment is illustrated in @xcite , where the displacement field is expanded in vector spherical harmonics , which are defined for completeness in [ sec : vect - spher - harm ] since we use them in our approach as well .",
    "in early work , barths - biesel @xcite considered the steady state of an initially spherical elastic capsule using a small deformation expansion .",
    "the membrane is assumed to be homogeneous , isotropic , area - incompressible , and shows no resistance against bending .",
    "to linear order in the deformation only tank - treading motions are possible in the long time limit . only at higher order",
    "a transition to tumbling can occur , when the shear forces have deformed the capsule sufficiently . in the steady state ,",
    "the capsule is orientated with inclination angle @xmath30 while the membrane performs a tank - treading motion . with increasing shear rate , the deformation first increases linearly with quadratic corrections . in @xcite ,",
    "the relaxational dynamics of a capsule with arbitrary elastic response was obtained still excluding bending energy .",
    "there , results have also been obtained in limit cases , like droplets ( showing only surface tension ) or red blood cells ( having a local area incompressibility ) .",
    "more recent theoretical efforts are reviewed by d.  barths - biesel and c.  pozrikidis in chapter 1 and 2 , respectively , of @xcite .",
    "bending energy was first included for capsules by rochal @xcite .      for a capsule with a spherical equilibrium shape",
    "all membrane points are equivalent from a mechanical point of view .",
    "this is no longer true for an initially non - spherical capsule such as an rbc , since the long and short axes are distinguished points on the membrane . for a discussion of the consequences for the energetics of a tank - treading motion",
    "let us assume that the capsule membrane is unstressed in the equilibrium state .",
    "as with tank - treading motion , we now rotate the membrane by the phase angle @xmath31 . since the local geometry of the capsule of each membrane element is different from that of the starting position",
    ", the capsule membrane will be sheared , requiring a positive elastic energy .",
    "consequently , a force aims to restore the unstressed equilibrium state . only after a rotation by @xmath32",
    "the initial and final position of each membrane point are equivalent to each other due to the mirror symmetry of the ellipsoidal capsule .",
    "the membrane is then again unstressed .",
    "any membrane element therefore energetically prefers its initial position ( or one of the equivalent positions by symmetry of the reference shape ) .",
    "this property is called shape memory effect @xcite , and plays an important role also in the dynamics of red blood cells @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of the shape memory effect is that capsules perform tumbling motions for low shear rates . here ,",
    "the hydrodynamic forces are not sufficient to overcome the elastic barrier which is present for a hypothetical tank - treading motion . only for higher shear rates the elastic barrier",
    "can be overcome and tank - treading motion becomes possible . since the force balance of a capsule is also slightly changed by the shape memory effect , one now observes stable oscillations of the inclination angle @xmath13 around a finite value instead of a stationary tank - treading state .",
    "this type of motion has therefore been called swinging motion @xcite .",
    "this term should not be confused with the swinging mode of fluid vesicles , which is also called vacillating - breathing or trembling @xcite .      for quantitative results beyond asymptotic limits",
    "one has to resort to numerical methods for capsules in shear flow .",
    "boundary integral methods ( bim ) have been used as first approaches in handling capsules in flow @xcite . as a mixture of global spectral methods @xcite and boundary integral methods , the spectral collocation @xcite and the spectral boundary methods @xcite have been developed which use higher order basis functions on a triangulated surface .",
    "the immersed boundary method @xcite can be implemented in any hydrodynamic solver . here , the force density of the boundary is mapped onto a cartesian mesh .",
    "it has been combined with solvers of the navier - stokes equation @xcite and with lattice boltzmann methods @xcite .",
    "the front tracking technique @xcite can handle two - phase flows and was used with a finite volume method to treat two - dimensional capsules @xcite .",
    "the oscillations of the shape and orientation of non - spherical capsules have first been observed by ramanujan @xcite who used a boundary spectral method . for high and low deformations this method",
    "was plagued by numerical instabilities due to the degradation of the grid .",
    "further improvement of the boundary element method allows the stable simulation of swinging and tumbling of highly flattened capsulses only by numerically smoothing the surface @xcite .",
    "more recent approaches , such as the spectral boundary algorithms @xcite use higher order basis functions on the triangulated surface to avoid numerical instabilities .",
    "pure spectral methods @xcite employ global basis functions to parameterize the capsule membrane .",
    "the fluid dynamics part is also simulated using lattice boltzmann methods @xcite .",
    "recently , front - tracking methods have been employed to study the motion of two - dimensional @xcite or three - dimensional capsules @xcite .",
    "existing solvers for the dynamics of vesicles , which treat the flow at a continuum level , either employ the boundary integral method on a discrete triangulation scheme @xcite or a phase field or advected field model @xcite . an alternative route is provided by stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) or multi - particle collison dynamics ( mpcd ) , where the flow is modeled using effective fluid particles interacting with a dynamically triangulated membrane @xcite .",
    "early experiments @xcite confirmed the quasi - spherical predictions for the deformation parameter @xmath16 ( for not too high shear rates ) as well as the decreasing behaviour of the inclination angle @xmath13 for increasing shear rate .",
    "although the inclination angle @xmath13 deviated from the theoretical prediction @xmath33 even in the limit of vanishing shear rates @xmath34 @xcite , experiments together with the quasi - spherical results were used to infer values for the elastic parameters of the membrane .",
    "in contrast to the theoretical predictions for spherical shapes , capsules in such experiments @xcite showed oscillations of both the deformation @xmath16 and the inclination angle @xmath13 .",
    "these oscillations caused by the fact that real capsules deviate from a perfectly spherical shape are a direct consequence of the shape memory effect discussed above in section  [ sec : shape - memory - effect ] .    in order to observe tumbling motion for experimentally accessible shear rates , capsules which show a large deviation form the spherical shape have to be used .",
    "red blood cells are an ideal and convenient choice . in early experiments , red blood cells",
    "have only be examined either in a tumbling state in the blood plasm or in a swinging state for high shear rates showing a stationary inclination angle @xcite .",
    "the motion for low shear rates and close to the swinging transition was experimentally examined by abkarian @xcite . within the swinging regime",
    "the frequency of the oscillation of the inclination angle is exactly twice the frequency corresponding to the tank - treading motion .",
    "while a membrane point is advected a full rotation along the membrane , the inclination angle is performing two full swinging motions .",
    "this relation highlights the direct connection between the oscillations of the shape and the motion of the membrane . for a decreasing shear rate within the swinging regime , the frequency of the oscillation decreases , while the oscillation amplitute of inclination angle increases .",
    "the numerical analysis of the full equations of motion using spectral methods @xcite discussed in section  [ sec : numerics ] yields qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "interestingly , a hysteresis effect at the transition between tumbling and swinging occurs when alternatingly increasing and decreasing the shear rate @xcite . here , a single tumbling motion seems to mix with multiple swinging motions .",
    "rather than deforming to a slightly ellipsoidal shape , certain polymeric capsules show a wrinkling instability while tank - treading in a linear shear flow @xcite , see figure  [ fig : wrinkling ] .",
    "the wrinkles are caused by a compression - force acting onto the membrane .",
    "although the membrane moves along the stationary shape while tank - treading , both position and direction of the wrinkels remain constant as they are caused by the compression part of the elongational part of the flow .",
    "thin membranes are unstable with respect to compressive forces . in a flat geometry , compression leads to euler buckling on the largest possible length scale . to produce small length scale wrinkles on a flat membrane",
    "one needs a combination of tensile stress along the wrinkles and a non - local geometric constraint @xcite .    ) in shear flow as indicated by the arrows ( adapted from @xcite ) . ]     ( left ) and @xmath35 ( right ) , respectively .",
    "the elastic moduli of the membrane are @xmath36 , @xmath37 . in the black coloured region",
    "the membrane is still stable with respect to wrinkle formations .",
    "brighter colons indicate a larger growth rate of the wrinkles .",
    "initially , wrinkling occurs only in a small region around the circumference corresponding to the plane of maximal compressive stress . at higher shear rates",
    ", this region grows , as does the growth rate of each wrinkling mode .",
    "the direction of the wrinkles along the lines of maximal tension are indicated schematically ( adapted from @xcite ) . ]    in the small deformation regime this wrinkling instability was analytically explained in @xcite using a separation of length scales , since the capsule radius is much larger than the typical wavelength of the wrinkles . even though the overall dynamics of a capsule in viscous flow is inherently non - hamiltonian",
    ", energy considerations dominate the physics at the small length scale of the wrinkles .",
    "the energy required to form wrinkles of amplitude @xmath38 and local wave number @xmath39 is @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the area incompressibility and @xmath42 the compression produced by the hydrodynamic force .",
    "this term drives the instability .",
    "large wave numbers @xmath39 are penalized energetically by the bending energy @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast to a flat membrane , buckling on any length scale on a curved membrane costs elastic energy @xmath44 , since the area of the membrane is increased ( decreased ) when a membrane element is moved outwards ( inwards ) .",
    "the resulting tensile ( compressive ) stress suppresses buckling on too large scales . only when the compressive force is large enough formation of wrinkles",
    "can reduce the elastic energy in the system .",
    "this happens at intermediate wave numbers , which can be calculated by minimizing above energy .    for polymerized capsules , the analytical expression for the critical shear rate above which the wrinkling starts reads @xmath45 and",
    "the critical wavelength of the wrinkles becomes @xmath46{\\frac{4 \\mu}{r^{2}\\kappa } \\frac{k}{k +          \\mu}}.\\ ] ] at @xmath47 , the wrinkles start to form along a circumference which forms an angle of @xmath33 with respect to the shear direction . at higher shear rates @xmath48 ,",
    "wrinkling extends over larger regions on the capsule , as shown in figure  [ fig : region ] .",
    "the analytical expression for the critical shear rate would allow for an experimental determination of the bending rigidity of the membrane which is difficult to obtain otherwise .",
    "so far , experimental work seems not to have taken up this suggestion .",
    "we now turn to capsules which are initially non - spherical .      in the theory of keller and skalak @xcite , a red blood cell ( rbc )",
    "is treated within a simplified model . since as an essential ingredient the shape memory effect of rbcs is missing within this simplified description , the model does not capture essential parts of the physics . yet , for vesicles the keller - skalak model delivers quite a good description . since it is also the basis for the further modelling of capsules , we briefly recall its main features .",
    "the three - dimensional rbc or vesicle is assumed to have a fixed ellipsoidal shape @xmath49 see figure  [ fig : phasedef ] .",
    "the ( cartesian ) components of the undisturbed shear flow are @xmath50 . in order to mimic a tank - treading motion of the membrane , the velocity field at the membrane",
    "is assumed to have components @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a parameter having the dimensions of a frequency .",
    "the energy supplied by the external flow has to be balanced with the energy dissipated inside the rbc .",
    "likewise the torques acting on the rbc have to balance .",
    "the equation of motion of the rbc derived from this torque balance reads @xcite @xmath53 the dissipated energy must come from the work performed by the external flow , which leads to the equation @xmath54 where the geometric quantities @xmath55 depend only upon the ratios of the axis lengths @xmath56 and are defined by @xmath57 both balance laws can be simplified to @xmath58 with @xmath59    the phase diagram for the dynamics of rbcs or vesicles is rather simple in the keller - skalak model .",
    "the transition between tumbling and tank - treading is independent of the shear rate . for given half axes",
    "@xmath56 , there is a critical viscosity contrast @xmath60 given by @xmath61 , below which the rbc or vesicle performs a tank - treading motion . for larger viscosity contrast , it undergoes a tumbling motion .",
    "the transition from tumbling to tank - treading is thus independent of the shear rate @xmath62 within the keller - skalak model .    for low viscosity contrast @xmath63 , i.e.  @xmath64 ,",
    "one obtains a steady tank - treading angle @xmath65 and a steady tank - treading frequency @xmath66 for high viscosity contrast @xmath67 , i.e.  @xmath68 , one obtains a steady tumbling motion with mean tumbling rate @xmath69      the keller - skalak model in its original form can only correctly describe the motion of vesicles , as it does not take into account the shape memory effect .",
    "abkarian @xcite and skotheim @xcite extended the keller - skalak model to remedy this deficiency .",
    "the membrane with its elastic property serves as an energy storage and induces an additional torque onto the capsule .",
    "the elastic energy @xmath70 required for a hypothetical tank - treading motion must be positive and periodic in the phase angle @xmath29 with period @xmath71 , as argued in section  [ sec : shape - memory - effect ] . in @xcite ,",
    "the energy was modeled as a simple harmonic function @xmath72 a keller - skalak derivation balancing energy and torque leads to two equations of motion for the two degrees of freedom , the inclination angle and the phase angle .",
    "@xmath73 with constants @xmath74    in dimensionless quantities of shear rate @xmath75 , viscosity ratio @xmath76 and eccentricity @xmath77 @xmath78 the equations of motion can be cast in simple form @xcite @xmath79 here , where @xmath80 is a dimensionless time defined differentially as @xmath81    solving the equations of motion within the reduced model for arbitrary parameters has been performed numerically @xcite .",
    "kessler @xcite have obtained analytical solutions in the quasi - spherical limit and , using of the method of asymptotic expansion @xcite , both the stable trajectories and the slope of the transition between tumbling and swinging .    for small shear rates",
    "@xmath62 the capsule always tumbles as the hydrodynamic forces are too weak to overcome the elastic barrier . for increasing shear rate the transition to the intermittent motion takes place .",
    "by further increasing the shear rate , the transition to swinging occurs for small and moderate viscosity contrast @xmath82 .    the phase diagram ( see figure  [ fig : reducedphasediagram ] ) of this reduced model shows the regimes of the three possible motions .",
    "either the capsule tumbles , swings or performs an intermittent motion with mixed tumbling and swinging periods .",
    "the normalized mean tumbling rate @xmath83 serves as an order parameter to distinguish between the possible motions @xcite .",
    "pure tumbling motion is characterized by @xmath84 , pure swinging by @xmath85 , while for intermittent motion the mean tumbling rate @xmath86 takes values between 0 and 1 .",

    "dark grey colour corresponds to a vanishing mean tumbling rate @xmath85 , while light grey corresponds to pure tumbling @xmath84.,title=\"fig : \" ]      to check the validity of the reduced model , its predictions have to be compared with the full non - linear dynamical motion obtained by numerical methods .",
    "the first systematic numerical phase diagram for a large range of shear rate and viscosity contrast was constructed using the spectral method described in section  [ sec : numerics ] @xcite . using this method , tumbling motions for capsules slightly deviating from the spherical shape",
    "were observed numerically for the first time .    the phase diagram obtained from the spectral method as shown in figure  [ fig : phasediagramkessler ] shows qualitative agreement with the predictions of the reduced model .",
    "the reduced model correctly predicts a swinging and tumbling motion and a transition for increasing shear rate .",

    "the inverse shear rate @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the shear modulus of the capsule . for low shear rates the capsule tumbles while for higher shear rates the capsule performs swinging motions for a not too high viscosity contrast . in between these two regimes",
    ", there is either a transient regime or intermittent regime deduced by the spectral method or the reduced model , respectively . adapted from @xcite . ]    yet , in the intermittent regime of the reduced model , only transient motion was found in the full model as can be seen in figure  [ fig : transient ] .     and",
    "the phase angle @xmath29 where the arrow denotes the direction of time .",
    "initially , the capsule tumbles with oscillating @xmath29 and steadily decreasing @xmath13 , but finally ends up in a swinging motion , where @xmath13 begins to oscillate around a stable value . adapted from @xcite . ]    here , the capsule initially tumbles with an steadily decreasing inclination angle @xmath13 , while the phase angle @xmath29 is oscillating .",
    "after a few tumbling motions , the capsule starts to perform stable swinging motions , where the inclination angle @xmath13 oscillates around a stable mean value , while the phase angle @xmath29 is steadily decreasing .",
    "independent studies using two different solvers confirmed this finding : a transient motion relaxing from a tumbling motion into a stable swinging motion was always observed in the intermittent regime @xcite .",
    "we therefore prefer to call the disputed regime transient rather than intermittent @xcite .",
    "close to the transition to tumbling , the oscillation of the inclination angle @xmath13 is very strong , surprisingly leading to temporarily negative values of the inclination angle , as first noted by kessler @xcite . here",
    ", the shape changes are very pronounced .",
    "this effect was somewhat unfortunately named breathing by bagchi @xcite .",
    "it should not be confused with the vacillating - breathing motion for vesicles @xcite because it does not show pronounced deformations perpendicular to the shear plane . moreover , the mean inclination angle is not close to zero but finite .",
    "since in all studies shape changes are highly pronounced in the transient regime ( see @xcite in particular ) , this reduced model has to be expanded to allow for shape changes to unambiguously clarify the status of the disputed intermittency .",
    "from the numerical findings it is clear that allowing shape changes is one important ingredient needed to solve the open intermittency question .",
    "noguchi @xcite incorporated shape changes within the reduced model heuristically , following extensions of the keller - skalak model for vesicles @xcite . besides inclination and phase angle ,",
    "a shape parameter is used as a third degree of freedom . the elastic energy due to shape changes",
    "is numerically calculated by stretching a biconcave membrane ( with a skalak energy law ) .",
    "the equation of motion of the shape parameter is deduced by a deformation from the sphere , while the equations of motions for the two angles are obtained by a keller - skalak derivation @xcite .",
    "the overall phase diagram of the extended model was qualitatively no different from that of the reduced model .",
    "in particular , the intermittent motions survived . a temporarily negative inclination angle @xmath13 is also found in the expanded model .",
    "the effect of the bending energy was studied using the same heuristic approach @xcite .",
    "we would like to replace this ad - hoc treatment of shape changes by a systematic expansion of the full equations of motion . specifically , we expand the equations of motion of the capsule for nearly spherical shapes .",
    "while the deformation of the capsule shape from a sphere stays small , the displacement of a membrane element during a tank - treading motion is usually large and can not be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the derivation of the elastic energy and the equations of motion is straightforward , but would distract from the main physics .",
    "details are therefore presented in appendix  b and appendix  c. from the elastic energy , we derive the elastic forces , which must be balanced by hydrodynamic forces .",
    "the hydrodynamic forces have contributions from the externally imposed flow and from the induced velocity field , which must be solved dynamically .",
    "no - slip boundary conditions at the membrane and at the external walls uniquely determine the dynamics .    rather than specializing to linear shear flow , we consider general linear external flow @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is a measure of the strength of the elongational flow component and @xmath93 is the vorticity .",

    "we can thus separate the flow fields induced by an elongational and rotational part and flow induced by the membrane forces and torques @xmath263 for the rotational velocity field @xmath264 we take the corresponding component of the external flow throughout @xmath265 since the hydrodynamic stress of a purely rotating fluid vanishes , this flow does not induce forces at the membrane . as the elastic energy of the membrane depends on @xmath226 ,",
    "a torque is exerted on the surrounding fluid .",
    "this torque is , however , of the order @xmath266 and is neglected in the following .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition at the capsule membrane therefore requires @xmath267 for @xmath268 we chose a flow which matches the elongational part of the external flow at infinity and vanishes at the sphere .",
    "while such a flow field produces surface forces on the capsule membrane , these forces only depend on the outer viscosity @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting force at @xmath269 is @xmath270    the remaining flow field is induced by the surface forces of the capsule membrane and of the hydrodynamic stress jump of the extensional flow .",
    "the induced flow field itself vanishes away from the capsule . in other words ,",
    "the induced flow field is the same as in an ambient fluid .",
    "the global flow field can be found explicitly ( see @xcite ) , but is of no interest here .",
    "we only need to know the value of the flow field at the capsule .",
    "the linear relationship between the surface forces and the induced velocity is given by the ( inverse ) oseen tensor @xmath271 the viscosity contrast only appears in the expression of the oseen tensor , which reads explicitly @xcite @xmath272 again , local area incompressibility enforces a coupling between radial and tangential flow .",
    "finally , the membrane is advected with the resulting flow owing to the no - slip boundary condition .",
    "the membrane dynamics is thus governed by the equation @xmath273 here , the material time derivative of the deformation amplitude reads @xmath274 in the following we only take the rotational part of the flow when calculating the advection , since the other contributions are smaller by a factor @xmath233 . in other words , we use @xmath275 this is justified because the rotational velocity is an order of magnitude larger than the velocity components leading to a membrane deformation .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : feq ] , [ eq : nosliprot ] , [ eq : fs ] , [ eq : vind ] , [ eq : eom ] , [ eq : advection ] ) specify the dynamics of the capsule in the quasi - spherical limit completely .",
    "we see that in linear external flow only the @xmath260 modes can be excited .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to only taking @xmath260 deformation modes . since the radial and tangential modes are coupled by the local area constraint",
    ", we can eliminate the latter modes . by redefining the time scale @xmath80 and introducing dimensionless strengths of the rotational @xmath111 and elongational @xmath110 flow analogously to @xcite ( see ( [ eq : paramsevans ] ) )",
    "the equations of motions simplify to ( omitting the now redundant @xmath276 and @xmath260 indices ) @xmath277    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations are formally very similar to the equations of motions for vesicles in ( 48 ) of @xcite .",
    "let us first search for solutions which show the same mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath20-plane as the external flow .",
    "thus , only the modes with @xmath278 are non - zero ( also for @xmath279 ) .",
    "since the modes are normalized to @xmath280 , we can employ the parametrisation @xmath281 here , @xmath282 $ ] is the inclination angle of the capsule with respect to the @xmath21-axis , @xmath99 $ ] . to compare with the equations of motion ( [ eq : skotheimeoma ] , [ eq : skotheimeomb ] ) in the reduced skotheim model , ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : reducedmodel ] ) it is advantageous to switch to the phase angle @xmath31 in the capsule frame rather than the phase angle @xmath221 in the laboratory frame .",
    "both angles are related by the inclination angle , @xmath283 .",
    "we thus arrive at the equations of motion ( [ eq : qseoma][eq : qseomc ] ) .",
