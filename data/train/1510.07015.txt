    "study of compact objects like star takes much attention to the astrophysicists for the last few decades .",
    "it plays the crucial role like a bridge among astrophysics , nuclear physics and particle physics .",
    "one of the possible existing compact objects in our universe is neutron star ( or strange star ) .",
    "neutron stars are the most acceptable and known compact objects for the study of dense matter physics . in general , neutron stars",
    "are composed almost entirely of neutrons , while strange stars are made from strange quark matter(sqm ) .",
    "if we consider strange quark matter is stable then strange stars may be formed during supernova explosions . as a consequence of this neutron stars can be converted to strange stars by a number of different mechanisms such as : a ) pressure - induced transformation to uds - quark matter via ud - quark matter , b ) sparking by high - energy neutrinos , c ) triggering due to the intrusion of a quark nugget .",
    "all of these possibilities were described by c. alcock , e. farhi , and a. olinto@xcite .",
    "scientific community beleive that a much more rapid cooling of sqm in strange stars takes place than neutron stars due to neutrino emitting weak interactions involving the quarks@xcite .",
    "therefore , a strange star was known as much colder than a neutron star of similar age .",
    "the most massive compact stars are entirely made of quarks , i.e. they are quark stars@xcite .",
    "famous scientist edward witten@xcite concluded that  if quark matter is stable , it is probably necessary to assume that ordinary neutron stars are really quark stars `` .",
    "recently observed neutron star or strange star have been detected in the milky way and only very few of them have been discovered in globular clusters .",
    "some of the possible existing compact stars(neutron star ) are psr j1614 - 2230 , psr j1903 + 327 , cen x-3 , smc x-1 , vela x-1 , her x-1@xcite .",
    "many researcher studied@xcite compact stars in various directions .",
    "scientists used different techniques such as computational , observational or theoretical analysis to study astrophysical objects . since the uncertainty in the behavior of matter inside the compact stars (  normal matter for neutron stars '' or ",
    "strange quark matter for strange stars \" ) , their physical structure and some physical property can be obtained by applicable analytic solutions of einstein s gravitational field equations .",
    "the relativistic stellar model have been studied by karl schwarzschild in 1916@xcite , occasionally the first solution of einstein s field equation for the interior of a compact object which are in hydrostatic equilibrium . in this regard",
    ", an important investigation was done by tolman @xcite in 1939 . in his paper , he proposed eight evident analytical solutions of the field equations .",
    "clifford e. rhoades , jr .",
    "and remo ruffini@xcite showed that maximum possible mass of a neutron star can not be larger than 3.2@xmath1 .",
    "buchdahl@xcite also contributed an important study of the fluid spheres by obtaining the famous bound to the mass(m ) - radius(r ) ratio for stable general relativistic spheres , which is @xmath2 .",
    "+ inspite of considerable progress in current years , still there are some important features to be addressed about neutron stars .",
    "observations of masses and radii confirms the theoretical model for white dwarf stars .",
    "however , due to the uncertainities in the equation of state of neutron stars , observations of masses and radii are used to test theories of neutron stars .",
    "+ motivated by the above facts we are introducing a theoretical model of neutron stars which indicates the possible equation of state , determine the masses and radii of various neutron stars .",
    "the solution presented in this article satisfies all the energy conditions , tov - equation , and buchdahl mass - radius relation@xcite which is required for the stability of the stars .",
    "it also satisfies other stability condition like speed of sound ( @xmath3 ) inside the star and adiabetic index ( @xmath4 ) in radial adiabatic perturbations . in this article",
    "we are able to give an equation of state(eos ) relating pressure and matter density of the star which is also a support for stiff equation of state for neutron star .",
    "interestingly , the star masses calculated from our model is well matched with the observed stars masses , which confirm the validity of our model for real case .",
    "+ in sec ii , we have discuss the interior spacetime and behavior of the star . in sec .",
    "iii , we have studied some special features of the star namely , tov equation , energy conditions , stability , mass - radius relation , compactness and surface redshift in different sub - sections . in sec .",
    "iv , the article concluded with a short discussion with numerical data and concluding remarks .",
    "before we start it is worthy to mention that , we use geometric units @xmath5 throughout the article .",
    "in our stellar model , we consider a static and spherically symmetric matter distribution whose interior space time as : @xmath6 according to h. heintzmann@xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a ( dimensionless ) , c(dimensionless ) and @xmath9(length@xmath10 ) are constants .",
    "+ the matter within the star is to be considered as perfect fluid ( locally ) and consequently the energy momentum tensor for the fluid distribution can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the four velocity,@xmath13 is the matter density and @xmath14 is the fluid pressure .    )",

    "we observe that , pressure and density are maximum at the centre and decreases monotonically towards the boundary(fig . 1 and fig .",
    "therefore , they are well behaved in the interior of the stellar structure .",
    "the modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation describes the equilibrium condition for the compact star subject to the gravitational(@xmath21 ) and hydrostatic(@xmath22 ) forces , @xmath23 where , @xmath24 therefore , the static equilibrium configurations do exist in the presence of gravitational and hydrostatic forces ( fig 3 ) .",
    "we verify whether all the energy conditions , like , null energy condition(nec ) , weak energy condition(wec ) , strong energy condition(sec ) and dominant energy condition(dec ) are satisfied at the centre ( @xmath25 ) of the star or not . for this purpose the following equations to be satisfied : +    [ table:1 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     ) - density ( @xmath13 ) relation . ]    ) - density ( @xmath13 ) relation . ]",

    "the measured mass for the above pulsar in @xcite is @xmath26 up to the highest precession reported yet .",
    "+ with the help of arecibo and green bank radio timing observations and considering the relativistic shapiro delay , freire et al@xcite obtained new constraints on the mass of the pulsar and its companion and determine the accurate mass for psr j1903 + 327 as @xmath27 through a detailed analysis .",

    "+   + we have obtained quite interesting results from this model , which are as follows : +    1 .",
    "the solutions are regular at the origin .",
    "2 .   density and pressure variation at the interior of the neutron stars are well behaved(positive definite at the origin)[fig.1 and fig.2 ] .",
    "3 .   pressure reduced to zero at the boundary but density shows some finite value which is physically acceptable .",
    "4 .   in our model both",
    "the pressure and energy density are monotonically decreasing to the boundary .",
    "it also satisfies tov equation and energy conditions . 6 .",
    "our isotropic neutron star model satisfy herrera s stability condition @xcite .",
    "7 .   from the mass - radius relation",
    "( 9 , 10 ) , all desired interior features of a neutron stars can be evaluated .",
    "our model satisfies buchdahl mass - radius relation(@xmath33)@xcite .",
    "9 .   according to our model the surface redshift of the neutron stars is found within standard value i.e. @xmath34 which is satisfactory@xcite . 10 .",
    "this model is stable with respect to infinitesimal radial perturbations .",
    "11 . from fig .",
    "6 it is clear that our derived mass function is very much acceptable as the observed masses of various neutron stars are lying on the graph .",
    "we also give two possible equations of state(eos ) of matter at the interior of the star , one is polynomial(fig .",
    "9 ) and another is exponential(fig . 10 ) . but we see that best fitted equation of state(eos ) is exponential .",
    "we also estimated from our model that the equation of state of a neutron star would be like @xmath35 where @xmath36 are constant . 14 .",
    "according to our model , equation of state ( fig 11 ) for a neutron star should not be soft equation of state rather it would be a stiff equation of state which is also evidently proved in a result of f. @xmath37zel @xcite .",
    "therefore our model is justified for the neutron star psr j1614 - 2230 , psr j1903 + 327 , cen x-3 , smc x-1 , vela x-1 and her x-1 .",
    "hence we can conclude with the hope that it may be helpful to analyse the other neutron stars also .",
