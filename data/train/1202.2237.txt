    "the transverse ising model ( tim ) is described by a two - state ising hamiltonian with a term representing a field transverse to the spins ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the transverse field , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are pauli spin-@xmath5 operators and the first sum is over the nearest neighbors spins on the lattice .",
    "the model has been firstly applied to describe the phase transitions and the properties of hydrogen bonded ferroelectrics @xcite and magnetic ordered materials @xcite .",
    "this model in one dimension has no phase transition at finite temperatures ; however , at zero temperature it is ordered up to the critical value of the transverse field .",
    "the model has been solved exactly in one dimension @xcite . in high dimensions",
    "there are approximations for low - temperatures or high - temperatures regions @xcite .",
    "all other calculations are based on mean field type approximations .",
    "an effective field theory has been presented which improve over mean field results @xcite . since then",
    "many results have been obtained based on the effective field theory .",
    "more recently the model has been used to study the phase diagrams of nanowires systems @xcite and magnetization of nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to present rigorous upper bounds for the critical couplings .",
    "we will apply the results for the d=2 square lattice and the d=3 cubic lattice .",
    "in this section , we describe the methodology used by s barreto et al @xcite to derive an identity for the two - spin correlation function of the transverse ising model .",
    "the procedure used in this deduction was presented in reference @xcite to obtain an exact relation for the order parameter @xmath6@xmath3@xmath7 which generalizes callen s identity @xcite . the longitudinal two - spin correlation function @xmath6@xmath8@xmath7 can be calculated from @xmath9 where h is given by ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can be separated into two parts , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 includes all parts associated with site i and @xmath12 represents the rest of the hamiltonian .",
    "a direct calculation leads to    @xmath13 \\delta \\big>\\label{eq3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 represents the partial trace with respect to site i and @xmath15 .",
    "equation ( [ eq3 ] ) is an exact relation .",
    "however , it is difficult to be used",
    ". therefore , we will make an approximation based on the following decoupling ,    @xmath16\\delta\\big > \\approx \\big < s_l^z\\big[\\frac{tr_{(i)}s_i^z e^{-\\beta h_i}}{tr_{(i)}e^{-\\beta h_i}}-s_i^z\\big]\\big > < \\delta>\\label{eq4}\\ ] ]    inserting ( [ eq4 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) and using the fact that @xmath17 , we obtain , @xmath18 by expanding @xmath19 we see that the approximation is correct to the order of @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with the application of the correlation inequalities that will be used later to obtain the upper bounds for the critical couplings . in the next steps we will keep only the = sign of ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "let us write @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "diagonalizing and taking the partial trace over i , we get for the longitudinal spin correlation function , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25    introducing the exponential operator @xmath26 , @xmath27 , we obtain , @xmath28 where f(x ) is given by @xmath29 note that @xmath30 .",

    "considering the four neighbours of @xmath38 in ( [ eq9 ] ) , expanding the product , applying the exponential operators appearing in the powers of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in f(x ) , we obtain , @xmath41 where @xmath42 > 0 \\nonumber\\\\ & & b_2 = \\frac{1}{8}[f(4 j ) - 2f(2 j ) ] < 0 \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are neighbours of @xmath38 and @xmath46 is given by ( [ eq8 ] ) .",

    "upper bounds for the critical temperature @xmath51 for ising and multi - component spin systems have been obtained by showing ( for @xmath52@xmath7@xmath51 ) the exponential decay of the two - point function @xcite .",
    "the procedure to obtain these upper bounds for the critical couplings of the tranverse ising model is the following : we start from a two - point correlation function equations ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) and we make use of griffiths inequalities ( griffiths i , ii ) @xcite and newman and lebowitz inequalities @xcite .",
    "a proof of griffiths inequalities has been given for the xy model with no external field @xcite .",
    "extensions of griffiths - kelly - sherman inequalities to quantal systems , under external fields , both longitudinal and transverse , have been proved @xcite .",
    "the physical reason why the griffiths and similar inequalities are valid for the quantal xy - type hamiltonian is that the off - diagonal interaction , namely , @xmath53 , produce the decrease of the ferromagnetic correlation among the @xmath54-spins , but it is not sufficient big to create a cooperative effect to induce an antiferromagnetic correlation . in other words , one can say that @xmath55 is a dynamical random force acting on z - z correlations @xcite .",
