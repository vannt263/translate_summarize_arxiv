    "logarithmic limit sets of complex algebraic sets have been extensively studied .",
    "they first appeared in bergman s paper @xcite , and then they were further studied by bieri and groves in @xcite .",
    "recently their relations with the theory of non - archimedean fields and tropical geometry were discovered ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "they are now usually called tropical varieties , but they appeared also under the names of bergman fans , bergman sets , bieri - groves sets or non - archimedean amoebas .",
    "the logarithmic limit set of a complex algebraic set is a polyhedral complex of the same dimension as the algebraic set , it is described by tropical equations and it is the image , under the component - wise valuation map , of an algebraic set over an algebraically closed non - archimedean field . the tools used to prove these facts are mainly algebraic and combinatorial .    in this paper",
    "we extend these results to the logarithmic limit sets of real algebraic and semi - algebraic sets .",
    "the techniques we use to prove these results in the real case are very different from the ones used in the complex case .",
    "our main tool is the cell decomposition theorem , as we prefer to look directly at the geometric set , instead of using its equations . in the real case ,",
    "even if we restrict our attention to an algebraic set , it seems that the algebraic and combinatorial properties of the defining equations do nt give enough information to study the logarithmic limit set .    in the following we often need to act on @xmath0 with maps of the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an @xmath3 matrix .",
    "when the entries of @xmath4 are not rational , the image of a semi - algebraic set is , in general not semi - algebraic .",
    "actually , the only thing we can say about images of semi - algebraic sets via these maps is that they are definable in the structure of the real field expanded with arbitrary power functions .",
    "this structure , usually denoted by @xmath5 , is o - minimal and polynomially bounded , and these are the main properties we need in the proofs . moreover , if @xmath6 is a set definable in @xmath5 , then the image @xmath7 is again definable , as the functions @xmath8 are definable .",
    "this property is equivalent to say that @xmath5 has field of exponents @xmath9 .    in this sense",
    "the category of semi - algebraic sets is too small for our methods .",
    "it seems that the natural context for the study of logarithmic limit sets is to fix a general expansion of the structure of the real field that is o - minimal and polynomially bounded with field of exponents @xmath9 . for sets definable in such a structure , the properties that were known for the complex algebraic sets also hold .",
    "we can prove that these logarithmic limit sets are polyhedral complexes with dimension less than or equal to the dimension of the definable set , and they are the image , under the component - wise valuation map , of an extension of the definable set to a real closed non - archimedean field .",
    "an analysis of the defining equations and inequalities is carried out , showing that the logarithmic limit set of a closed semi - algebraic set can be described applying the maslov dequantization to a suitable formula defining the semi - algebraic set . then we show how the relation between tropical varieties and images of varieties defined over non - archimedean fields , well known for algebraically closed fields , can be extended to the case of real closed fields .",
    "we give the notion of non - archimedean amoebas of semi - algebraic sets and sets definable in other o - minimal structures and we study their relations with logarithmic limit sets of definable sets in @xmath10 , and with patchworking families of definable sets .",
    "note that this notion generalizes the notion of non - archimedean amoebas of semi - linear sets that have been used in @xcite to study tropical polytopes .",
    "our motivation for this work comes from the study of teichmller spaces and , more generally , of spaces of geometric structures on manifolds . in the papers @xcite and @xcite we present a construction of compactification using the logarithmic limit sets .",
    "the properties of logarithmic limit sets we prove here will be used in @xcite to describe the compactification .",
    "for example , the fact that logarithmic limit sets of real semi - algebraic sets are polyhedral complexes will provide an independent construction of the piecewise linear structure on the thurston boundary of teichmller spaces .",
    "moreover the relations with tropical geometry and the theory of non - archimedean fields will be used in @xcite for constructing a geometric interpretation of the boundary points .    a brief description of the following sections . in section [ sez : preliminaries ]",
    "we define a notion of logarithmic limit sets for general subsets of @xmath0 , and we report some preliminary notions of model theory and o - minimal geometry that we will use in the following , most notably the notion of regular polynomially bounded structures .    in section [ sez : poly ] we prove that logarithmic limit sets of definable sets in a regular polynomially bounded structure are polyhedral complexes with dimension less than or equal to the dimension of the definable set , and we provide a local description of these sets .",
    "the main tool we use in this section is the cell decomposition theorem .",
    "in section [ sez : non - arch ] we consider a special class of non - archimedean fields : the hardy fields of regular polynomially bounded structures .",
    "these are non - archimedean real closed fields of rank one extending @xmath9 , with a canonical real valued valuation and residue field @xmath9 .",
    "the elements of these fields are germs of definable functions , hence they have better geometric properties than the fields of formal series usually employed in tropical geometry . the image , under the component - wise valuation map , of definable sets in the hardy fields are related with the logarithmic limit sets of real definable sets , and with the limit of real patchworking families .    in section [ sez : comp ]",
    "we compare the construction of this paper with other known constructions .",
    "we show that the logarithmic limit sets of complex algebraic sets are only a particular case of the logarithmic limit sets of real semi - algebraic sets , and the same happens for the limit of complex patchworking families .",
    "hence our methods provide an alternative proof ( with a topological flavor ) for some known results about complex sets .",
    "we also compare the logarithmic limit sets of real algebraic sets with the construction of positive tropical varieties ( see @xcite ) .",
    "even if in many examples these two notions coincide , we show some examples where they differ .    in section [ sez : trop ]",
    "we show how the construction of maslov dequantization provide a relation between logarithmic limit sets of semi - algebraic sets and tropical geometry .",
