    "the limiting interior field might be estimated from the scalar virial theorem @xcite . for a typical neutron star mass 1.5@xmath5 and radius 15 km",
    ", the interior field could be as high as @xmath6 g.    such strong magnetic fields quantise the motion of charged particles perpendicular to the field @xcite .",
    "the effects of the phase space modification due to the landau quantisation were studied on the composition and equation of state ( eos ) in neutron stars extensively .",

    "baym , bethe and pethick considered the reduction of the nuclear surface energy due to the free neutron gas in their calculation @xcite . the study of nuclei in the neutron star crust was carried out using the energy density of a many body system by negele and vautherin @xcite . with increasing density in the inner crust",
    ", unusual nuclear shapes might appear there @xcite .",
    "the properties of nuclei in the inner crust were also investigated using a relativistic field theoretical model @xcite .",
    "there are two important aspects of the problem when nuclei are immersed in a neutron gas . on the one hand we have to deal with the coexistence of two phases of nuclear matter - denser phase inside a nucleus and low density phase outside it , in a thermodynamical consistent manner . on the other hand ,",
    "the determination of the surface energy of the interface between two phases with good accuracy is needed .",
    "it was shown that this problem could be solved using the subtraction procedure of bonche , levit and vautherin @xcite .",
    "the properties of a nucleus are isolated from nucleus plus neutron gas in a temperature dependent hartree - fock theory using the subtraction procedure .",
    "this same method was extended to isolated nuclei embedded in a neutron gas @xcite as well as nuclei in the inner crust at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this shows that it would be worth studying the properties of nuclei in the inner crust in the presence of strongly quantizing magnetic field relevant to magnetars using the subtraction procedure .",
    "recently the stability of nuclei embedded in an electron gas was investigated within a relativistic mean field model in zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it was observed in their calculation that nuclei became more stable against @xmath10 decay and spontaneous fission with increasing electron number density .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the electron number density is enhanced in the presence of strong magnetic fields due to landau quantisation compared with the zero field case .",
    "the question is whether the nuclear system in the inner crust of magnetars would be more stable than those of the field free case .",

    "though neutrons are not directly affected by the magnetic field , the neutron chemical potential is modified through the @xmath9-equilibrium due to landau quantisation of electrons .",

    "the dotted line denotes the zero field case . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath66 growing with the density reaches a maximum and then decreases . such a trend was observed in the calculation of negele and vautherin in the absence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we note that our predictions for @xmath96 g do not change from the field free results because a large number of landau levels is populated in that magnetic field . for magnetic field",
    "@xmath97 g , the total number of nucleons decreases in the density regime 0.005 - 0.02 @xmath2 compared with the corresponding results of the field free case .",
    "this can be understood from the behaviour of the cell size around that density regime in fig .",
    "2 . for @xmath93",
    "g , the zeroth landau level is populated by electrons for densities @xmath98 @xmath2 .",
    "this modifies the @xmath9-equilibrium and the charge neutrality conditions which , in turn , impact the size of the cell and the total number of nucleons in a cell .",
    "this effect is pronounced in the case of @xmath93 g. in this case , @xmath66 is significantly reduced compared with the zero field case for densities @xmath98 @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain neutron ( @xmath61 ) , proton ( @xmath62 ) and total nucleon numbers ( @xmath99 ) in the nucleus at each average baryon density following the subtraction procedure .",
    "total nucleon and proton numbers are shown in fig .",
    "7 for the above mentioned magnetic fields .",
    "when the magnetic field is @xmath80 g or more , it is noted that our results in certain cases start oscillating from the field free results . this may be attributed to the fact that the population of landau levels jumps from a few levels to zero in the above mentioned fields as baryon density decreases from higher to lower values .",
    "in contrast to fig . 6 ,",
    "we find total nucleon and proton numbers inside the nucleus at each density point beyond 0.002 upto 0.04 @xmath2 are significantly enhanced in case of @xmath100 g compared with the field free case as well as other magnetic fields considered here .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that more neutrons are inside the nucleus in the presence of strong magnetic fields @xmath101 g than in the gas phase in that density regime .",
    "this is opposite to the situation in the zero magnetic field .",
    "this can be easily understood from the density profiles with and without magnetic fields in fig . 4 and fig . 5 .",
    "we plot the free energy per nucleon of the system with average baryon density in fig .",
    "our results for @xmath96 g do not change much form the field free results .",
    "however , for @xmath97 g , the free energy per nucleon is reduced at lower densities ( @xmath102 0.004 @xmath2 ) as compared with the field free case .",
    "we find more pronounced reduction in the free energy per nucleon in the field @xmath93 g almost over the whole density regime considered here .",
    "we have investigated properties of nuclei in the inner crust and their stability in the presence of strong magnetic fields @xmath103 or more .",
    "nuclei are immersed in a neutron gas and uniform background of electrons .",
    "we have adopted the skm@xmath24 interaction for the nuclear energy density functional and studied this problem in the thomas - fermi model .",
    "electrons are affected through landau quantisation in strong magnetic fields because much less landau levels can be occupied in these cases . consequently , electron number density and energy density are modified in strongly quantising magnetic field and the @xmath9-equilibrium condition is altered compared with the field free case .",
    "the enhancement of electron number density in magnetic fields @xmath101 g due to the population of the zeroth landau level leads to enhancement in proton fraction through the charge neutrality condition .",
    "we minimise the free energy of the system within a wigner - seitz cell to obtain the nucleus at each average baryon density . in this connection we used the subtraction procedure to obtain the density profiles of a nucleus from the nucleus plus gas and only gas solutions at each average baryon density point .",
    "we note that less number of neutrons drip out of a nucleus in the presence of strong fields than the situation without magnetic field .",
    "this results in larger mass and proton numbers in a nucleus in the presence of magnetic field @xmath104 g compared with the corresponding nucleus in the field free case . further the free energy per nucleon of the system is reduced in magnetic fields @xmath101 g.    magnetars might eject crustal matter due to tremendous magnetic stress on the crust @xcite .",
    "the ejected matter of the inner crust might expand to much lower densities .",
    "the decompressed crustal matter has long been considered as an important site for @xmath92-process nuclei @xcite .",
    "it would be worth studying the @xmath92-process in the decompressed crustal matter of magnetars using the results of our calculation as an input .",
