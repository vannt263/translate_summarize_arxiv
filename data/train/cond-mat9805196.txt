    "phase - separating binary fluids form complex patterns of domains after a quench into the two - phase region of the phase diagram .",
    "the domain morphology is determined by a number of factors such as the volume fractions of the two phases , their viscosities , and any external forces applied to the system @xcite .",
    "of particular interest here is the effect of an external shear flow applied to the fluid .",
    "the shear flow competes with the phase - separation process , influencing the morphology and stability of the domains . besides being a fascinating problem in nonequilibrium physics",
    ", this question is of practical significance because the final properties of industrial materials involving binary fluids often depend on the domain morphology .    at late times after a quench into an unstable state , a phase - separating binary fluid consists of domains of the two phases which coarsen with time .",
    "the presence of a shear flow dramatically alters the kinetics of the phase separation .",
    "the effects of the deformation by the shear flow depend on the relations between the various time scales in the system .",
    "the characteristic time scale for the shear flow is just the inverse shear rate , @xmath0 . when this time is shorter than the characteristic relaxation time of thermal concentration fluctuations @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the system is in a `` strong - shear '' regime in which the critical fluctations are modified by the flow .",
    "conversely , in the `` weak - shear '' regime @xmath3 the critical fluctuations are not affected by the flow .",
    "a third time scale , which will be crucial here , is associated with the domains .",
    "clearly when the growth rate of the domains , or the growth rate of any instabilities associated with the domains , is smaller than the time associated with the flow , the shear flow will affect the morphology and stability of the domains .    of interest in this paper is the competition between the shear flow and the coarsening process .",
    "the shear flow tends to deform and elongate or fragment domains , whereas the thermodynamics favors coarsening to larger , isotropic domains .",
    "this competition leads to the formation of a nonequilibrium , dynamic steady state in which the coarsening is stopped by the shear flow @xcite . when the viscosities of the two phases are similar and one phase forms a droplet phase , the steady state consists of somewhat deformed droplets of the order of the taylor breakup size @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the surface tension , @xmath6 the viscosity and @xmath7 the shear rate @xcite . on the other hand , when the two phases are both percolated the morphology is an anisotropic bicontinuous structure with apparently stable domains highly elongated along the flow direction .",
    "the anisotropy in these bincontinuous patterns is much larger than the aspect ratio of 2 or 3 seen for isolated droplets @xcite .",
    "microscope observations have shown that the domains can be elongated into long cylinders @xcite . in weak shear , @xmath8 ,",
    "these stringlike domains still undergo frequent breakup , reconnection , and branching , whereas in the strong - shear regime the system forms a `` string phase '' consisting of macroscopically long cylindrical domains aligned with the flow direction .",
    "these are surprising observations , since a long fluid cylinder at rest is unstable against breaking up into spherical droplets via the rayleigh capillary instability @xcite .",
    "in the situation under consideration here , the string is a domain of one phase immersed in the other , which we would also expect to be thermodynamically unstable since the cylinder could lower its surface energy by spheroidizing .",
    "thus the shear flow stabilizes both the thermodynamic instability towards phase separation and the hydrodynamic instability of these highly elongated domains .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the stabilization of cylindrical domains by an imposed shear flow .",
    "it is a sequel to my previous work on the stabilization by shear flow of a two - dimensional , lamellar domain in phase - separating binary fluids @xcite . in that paper",
    "it was shown that a lamellar domain at rest with diffuse interfaces is unstable towards a `` varicose '' instability .",
    "this instability is essentially a coarsening effect and depends on the finite width of the interfaces ; in the limit of mathematically sharp interfaces a lamellar domain is stable .",
    "an external shear flow stabilizes the lamellar domain by advecting the top and bottom interfaces with respect to each other so that they no longer can maintain the exact phase relation which produces the unstable varicose mode .",
    "the instability of a quiescent cylindrical domain of one phase immersed in the other is somewhat different , owing to the different dimensionality .",
    "there are two separate forces driving instability , one hydrodynamic and one thermodynamic .",
    "rayleigh @xcite and later tomotika @xcite analyzed the instability of an infinitely long viscous fluid cylinder immersed in an immiscible fluid to axisymmetric varicose perturbations as shown in fig .",
    "[ varicose ] .",
    "when the wavelength of the varicosity is equal to or longer than the circumference of the cylinder the perturbation is unstable and grows .",
    "this is because the higher curvature in the necks leads to a higher laplace pressure there than in the bulges , which tends to drive fluid from the necks toward the bulges .",
    "eventually the cylinder will break up into spherical droplets , with less total surface energy than the original cylinder .",
    "however , even in the absence of fluid motion ( e.g.  consider a cylindrical domain in a solid binary alloy ) a cylindrical domain in the two - phase state is still unstable .",
    "this is due to the gibbs - thomson effect , in which the chemical potential depends on the curvature @xcite .",
    "the higher curvature at the necks will drive a diffusive flux towards the bulges , also leading to instability .",
    "both of these mechanisms are present even in the limit that the interfaces are mathematically sharp .    in this paper",
    "i perform a linear stability analysis to investigate the effect of an external shear flow on the stability of a single infinitely long cylindrical domain , perfectly aligned with the flow .",
    "i consider late times after a quench into the two - phase region , when the fluid consists of domains of the two phases close to their equilibrium concentrations , separated by well - defined interfaces .",
    "the formulation of the problem allows in principle for diffuse interfaces with a finite width @xmath9 ( when the viscosities of the two phases are equal ) , but in practise results are much easier to obtain in the limit of mathematically sharp interfaces and the corrections due to finite widths will not affect the results qualitatively . the shear rate @xmath7 is assumed to be small enough that the system is in the weak - shear regime , @xmath3 , so that the shear flow will not influence the structure of the interfaces themselves . in this case the usual hydrodynamic equations for a phase - separating fluid are valid . as mentioned above",
    ", the string phase itself seems to form only in the strong - shear regime @xcite .",
    "however , here i will be concerned not with the formation of the string phase but with its stability .",
    "the goal is to understand the mechanism by which the shear stabilizes these remarkably elongated domains .",
    "the results may also illuminate the stability of the highly anisotropic , bicontinuous morphologies observed in weak shear .",
    "i will neglect the ends of the string and also the possiblity that it could be inclined at a small angle to the flow direction .",
    "this approximation seems reasonable given the extraordinarily high aspect ratio observed for the strings and the fact that long slender drops in shear have a long central portion which is cylindrical and aligned with the flow @xcite .",
    "as well as shedding light on the stability of elongated domains in phase - separating fluids , this work encompasses the problem of the effect of shear flow on the purely hydrodynamic viscous rayleigh instability in immiscible fluids ( neglecting the thermodynamic effects ) . to my knowledge this problem has not been solved before in the particular limit examined here .",
    "russo and steen @xcite and lowry and steen @xcite found that axial flows can suppress capillary instabilities on cylindrical interfaces .",
    "most other studies in the fluid dynamics literature concerning the effects of externally imposed flows on long fluid cylinders have been in the context of drop breakup .",
    "several authors have considered the linear stability of an infinitely long fluid cylinder in an elongational flow @xcite .",
    "the flow field limits the growth of any disturbance to a finite value so that there is no true instability , and the cylinder is stabilized .",
    "however , some disturbances have time to grow transiently to a finite amplitude comparable to the decreasing radius of the elongating cylinder , causing breakup ( even though the disturbances do not grow exponentially ) .",
    "khakhar and ottino @xcite extended the analysis to general linear flows including shear flow , but only in the case of small asymmetry , when the shear part of the flow is small compared to the stretching . in this paper",
    "i will explore the opposite limit in which the stretching is negligible but the asymmetry is large .",
    "finally , hinch and acrivos studied a finite , long slender drop in shear flow @xcite .",
    "they find steady - state solutions for the shape of the drop at all shear rates , but these equilibrium solutions are unstable above a critical shear rate .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the ends of the drop are not completely aligned with the flow , so that at sufficiently high shear rates the drop can not balance the stretching of the ends and it extends transiently , becoming progressively thinner .",
    "this does not happen for an infinitely long cylinder , as considered in this paper .    in sec .",
    "[ eqtns ] i will describe the model equations of motion used to describe the fluid . in sec .",
    "[ stab ] the equations of motion are linearized for small perturbations about a cylindrical domain .",
    "approximate solutions can be found by writing the stability eigenvalue equation as a matrix equation in a truncated set of `` basis '' states , corresponding to different perturbation modes of the cylinder .",
    "the matrix elements are calculated in sec .",
    "[ noshear ] .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "[ shearres ] that the shear flow has the effect of mixing nonaxisymmetric disturbances with the axisymmetric varicose mode , leading to stabilization in some circumstances .",

    "a simple binary mixture can be described by one scalar order parameter @xmath10 , the difference in concentration between the two components .",

    "the equation for the velocity ( [ n - s ] ) is generalized to include the coupling of the order parameter to the velocity field @xcite .",

    "essentially , the shear flow distorts the varicose mode by convecting one side of the cylindrical interface with respect to the other , eliminating the special axisymmetric , pinching character of the varicose mode that drove the instability .",
    "both the hydrodynamic rayleigh instability and the thermodynamic , diffusive instability are suppressed by the shear flow , although there are residual instabilities at small wave numbers in the limit that the diffusive terms dominate and also for viscosity ratios @xmath31 outside the range @xmath294 .",
    "other authors have considered the effect of flows on the rayleigh instability , but this is the first study focused on the effect of the nonaxisymmetric nature of shear flow on the rayleigh instability .    comparing with the experimental results of hashimoto _",
    "et al_. , i found the mechanism presented here for stabilization of the cylindrical domains is consistent with the stable `` string '' phase seen experimentally , and that the lengths of the strings may be set by the residual instabilty at long wavelengths .",
    "however , it should be noted that the stability of a cylindrical domain in shear flow does not act as a criterion for the observed relationship between the shear rate and the radius of the domains seen in the string phase .",
    "the domains in the string phase are formed through a dynamic process ; the observed radius is not a parameter of the system ( as in this calculation ) but rather is determined through the self - organization process as the shear flow competes with coarsening in the phase - separating system .",
    "i have merely demonstrated a mechanism by which these macroscopically long , cylindrical domains may be stabilized by the shear flow .",
    "although a few experiments have looked at the breakup of the string - like domains after complete cessation of the shear flow @xcite , it would be interesting to do a careful experimental study of the shear rate at which the strings first begin to be unstable to see if the rayleigh and/or thermodynamic varicose instabilities explored here are the main breakup mechanisms in these systems .",
    "if so then the strings should be unstable below the critical shear rate @xmath282 found in this paper .",
    "the results presented here may also shed light on why the shear flow can halt the phase separation and result in a dynamic steady state , even in the weak - shear regime , @xmath83 . in a concentrated phase - separating fluid when the two phases are both percolated so that the domains form a connected bicontinuous pattern , the coarsening is dominated by curvature effects .",
    "qualitatively we can think of a piece of the interconnected structure as a cylinder of fluid immersed in the other phase .",
    "this cylinder is susceptible to the varicose instabilities considered here , and particularly to the rayleigh instability , which leads to breakup of the cylindrical region into spheres .",
    "siggia @xcite used this picture to explain the coarsening rates seen in concentrated binary fluids .",
    "since the shear flow suppresses these instabilities , one might expect that it could stabilize an anisotropic , bicontinuous morphology against further coarsening . for a given shear rate , when the domains are relatively small they will be unstable and will coarsen , but once the typical length scale has grown to the critical radius for stabilization by the shear flow , @xmath346 , the parts of the bicontinuous structure that are cylindrical and aligned with the flow will no longer be unstable .",
    "this then provides a mechanism for the creation of the nonequilibrium dynamic steady state seen in concentrated phase - separating fluids in shear flow .",
