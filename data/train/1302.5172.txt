    "clusters of galaxies are important sources of various cosmological and astrophysical information especially on the formation history of the large scale structure and the estimates of cosmological parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "among others , mass of clusters is one of the most fundamental quantities in virtually all studies .",
    "the most conventional method is based on x - ray observations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) combined with the assumption that the icm is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) with the total gravity of the cluster ( we call the mass estimated by this method `` the hse mass '' ) .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that the hse assumption strictly holds , especially for unrelaxed clusters given their on - going dynamical evolution .",
    "therefore it is important to examine the validity of the hse assumption , which has been mostly assumed just for simplicity .",
    "the quantitative analysis of its validity and limitation is directly related to the applicability to the future scientific opportunities , including upcoming x - ray missions such as extended rntgen survey with imaging telescope array ( erosita ) and astro - h , and observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect performed by atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and south pole telescope ( spt ) .",
    "the validity of the hse assumption for observed clusters may be examined in a straightforward fashion by comparison of the hse mass with the cluster mass estimated by other methods . in this",
    "respect , gravitational lensing is particularly suited because it directly probes the total gravitational mass without any assumption on the dynamical state of dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , the lensing observations require a high angular resolution of the background galaxy images and are feasible only for a limited number of clusters located at @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the estimated lensing mass correspond to the cylindrical mass along the line of sight , and may include an extra contribution not associated with the cluster itself .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent ones ) show that the hse mass is smaller by approximately 20 percent on average than the lensing mass , suggesting either hse or lensing , or even both , should be systematically biased .",
    "another method to examine the validity of the hse assumption that we pursue in this paper is to use numerical simulations , which enable us to make a detailed and critical comparison of the simulated data against the model prediction .",
    "therefore we can locate the origin of systematic bias , if any , of the hse assumption .",
    "this is useful because we may be able to apply the correction to the observational data eventually .",
    "of course there are a number of previous studies of hse using simulated clusters , but their results do not seem to be converged .",
    "for instance , let us focus on a couple of recent papers @xcite that studied systematic errors in the hse mass using the _ same _ set of 16 clusters simulated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the gas particle data on the basis of the euler equations , and evaluated the _ effective _ mass terms corresponding to several different terms in the equations .",
    "@xcite performed basically the same analysis , but used the jeans equations instead of the euler equations despite the fact that they considered the gas particles in the simulated clusters .",
    "both reached the similar conclusion that the hse mass underestimates the true mass of clusters systematically by @xmath2 1020 % .",
    "nevertheless their physical interpretations of the origin of the bias are very different ; @xcite claimed that the coherent rotation of gas plays a significant role as an additional support against the gravity , while @xcite concluded that the random gas motion is responsible for the departure from hse , and the gas rotation makes a relatively negligible contribution .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to clarify the theoretical method to examine hse of the simulated clusters , and then to revisit its validity using a high - resolution hydrodynamical simulation by @xcite . in particular , we compare the two different analysis formulations adopted by @xcite and @xcite , and argue that the euler equations , rather than the jeans equations modified by a gas pressure gradient term @xcite , should be used in analyzing the gas dynamics .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 formulates our method to evaluate the validity of the hse assumption .",
    "we pay a particular emphasis on the comparison between the euler and jeans equations in analyzing the gas dynamics .",
    "the derivation of those sets of equations starting from the boltzmann equations is summarized in appendix a. section 3 briefly describes the simulated cluster , and then presents our analysis results of the validity of hse .",
    "finally our conclusion is summarized in section 4 . the analysis based on the jeans equations using dark matter particles",
    "is shown in appendix b.",
    "our analysis method to discuss the validity of hse using gas in a simulated cluster is based on the euler equations : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the density , velocity and pressure of gas . while the jeans equations do not describe the gas dynamics in their original form , @xcite and @xcite added the gas pressure gradient term to the jeans equations , and adopted the resulting equations in analyzing simulated clusters .",
    "we argue in the next subsection that this is not justified , and present the result based on the jeans equations but using collisionless dark matter particles in appendix b , for reference .",
    "we define the total mass @xmath8 of a cluster inside a volume @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total density of the cluster . for the simulated cluster considered throughout this paper ,",
    "@xmath11 consists of densities of gas , dark matter and stars , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "the total mass can be rewritten in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath6 using poisson s equation and gauss s theorem : @xmath13 , \\label{grave}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the surface surrounding the volume @xmath9 and we have used equation ( [ euler ] ) in the second equality .",
    "now the total mass is evaluated by the gas quantities alone , without any knowledge on dark matter and stars .",
    "this is why the present method is applicable , in principle , to the x - ray data of galaxy clusters .",
    "if we adopt a spherical surface as @xmath14 , the total mass can be decomposed into the following four _ effective _ mass terms : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 , \\label{mstre}\\ ] ] and @xmath19 we emphasize here that the above set of equations does not assume spherical symmetry of the system ; we just take a spherical surface as the integral surface and write down equation ( [ grave ] ) in spherical coordinates .",
    "the first term , @xmath20 , originates from the thermal pressure gradient of gas .",
    "if the gas motion is negligible , @xmath20 should be equal to the total mass @xmath8 , and thus regarded as a cluster mass estimated under the hse assumption .",
    "in other words , the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath20 is a quantitative measure of the departure from the hse assumption .",
    "the inertial term @xmath21 in the euler equations reduces to @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if there exists a coherent rotational motion around the center of the cluster , @xmath22 can be interpreted as the centrifugal force term .",
    "without such a motion , however , the local tangential velocity of different directions at different locations on the sphere could make @xmath22 significantly large .",
    "during the course of the cluster evolution , gas generally falls toward the center of the cluster with larger streaming speed with increasing radius from the center . in this case",
    ", @xmath23 becomes _ negative _ and can not be neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "it becomes positive and/or negligible , especially in the innermost region where the gas velocity is more randomized than that in the outer regions .",
    "finally the acceleration term , @xmath24 , corresponds to the @xmath25 term in the euler equations , and becomes positive / negative when gas is decelerating / accelerating .",
    "all the mass terms are invariant with respect to the choice of the axis of the spherical coordinates , but are not necessarily positive .",
    "note also that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , corresponding to the inertial term , are not invariant with respect to the galilean transformation . thus we evaluate those in the center - of - mass frame of the entire simulated cluster .",
    "the set of basic equations that we adopt in this paper is essentially identical to that of @xcite , except the fact that they interpreted the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath26 as `` turbulent gas motion '' while we call it the acceleration term @xmath24 as directly implied from equation ( [ euler ] ) , and evaluate it from the residual , @xmath27 .",
    "we are not sure why they ascribed the term to the turbulent motion .",
    "it is true that part of the gas acceleration would be due to the turbulent gas motion , but not entirely .",
    "furthermore the numerical simulation does not include any physical processes directly related to the turbulent motion .",
    "even if the turbulent motion might be important for real clusters , it should come from some physics below the subgrid scales that can not be properly resolved in the numerical simulation .",
    "effects of gas random motion above the resolved scales should be included in @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we note , however , that the different interpretation of @xmath24 does not affect at all the conclusion of @xcite that gas rotation is the most important term to describe the origin of departure from hse in their simulated clusters .",
    "as we will show below , this is not consistent with our result .    in previous literature ,",
    "the jeans equations are sometimes used in analyzing the gas motion in simulated clusters . for that purpose ,",
    "a thermal pressure gradient term is added by hand to the basic equations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming the steady state , i.e. , @xmath28 , the jeans equations in @xmath29-direction ( [ jeansr ] ) is now replaced by the following equation : @xmath30v_r + \\frac{1}{{\\rho_{\\mathrm{gas}}}}\\left[\\frac{1}{r}{\\frac{\\partial ( { \\rho_{\\mathrm{gas}}}{\\sigma_{r\\theta}}^2)}{\\partial\\theta } } + \\frac{1}{r\\sin\\theta}{\\frac{\\partial ( { \\rho_{\\mathrm{gas}}}{\\sigma_{r\\varphi}}^2)}{\\partial\\varphi}}\\right ] + \\frac{{\\sigma_{r\\theta}}^2\\cot\\theta}{r}\\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ -\\frac{{v_\\theta}^2+{v_\\varphi}^2}{r}=-\\frac{1}{{\\rho_{\\mathrm{gas}}}}{\\frac{\\partial ( { \\rho_{\\mathrm{gas}}}{\\sigma_{rr}}^2)}{\\partial r } } -\\frac{2{\\sigma_{rr}}^2-{\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}^2-{\\sigma_{\\varphi\\varphi}}^2}{r}-\\frac{1}{{\\rho_{\\mathrm{gas}}}}{\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}}-{\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r } } , \\end{split } \\label{laujeans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the @xmath32-component of the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "for example , @xcite converted each term of equation ( [ laujeans ] ) to the corresponding mass term ; see their equations ( 6 ) to ( 11 ) .",
    "then they interpreted that the first two terms on the right hand side of the above equation originate from `` random gas motion '' .",
    "we suspect that the implicit assumption underlying equation ( [ laujeans ] ) is that the icm consists of two distinct gas components ; the thermal gas and the unthermalized one such as the cold gas accreting along with galaxies into clusters . while it may be reasonable to take into account both components separately when dealing with _",
    "real galaxy clusters _ , it remains to be justified if the extra pressure gradient term can be added by hand to the conventional jeans equations assuming that the two components share the same density @xmath5 ( in appendix a we show that diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor in the jeans equations correspond to thermal pressure in the euler equations ) .",
    "it should also be recalled that the current numerical simulations are performed entirely on the basis of the euler equations . therefore , for the sake of consistency",
    ", it is appropriate to use the euler equations , instead of equation ( [ laujeans ] ) , in evaluating the mass terms of the _ simulated galaxy clusters_. the proper treatment of the unthermalized gas in numerical simulations is certainly an important issue , but is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we apply the analysis method in the previous section and quantitatively examine the validity of the hse assumption . for that purpose , we use a simulated cluster of @xcite .",
    "it is simulated with an eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code , enzo @xcite .",
    "although our current analysis exploits three - dimensional profiles of the cluster which can not be observed in reality , we are interested here in the validity of hse itself .",
    "the application to the x - ray observation will be discussed separately elsewhere .",
    "we briefly describe the main features of the current simulation , and refer readers to @xcite for more detail .",
    "the simulation was run first with a low resolution mode in a periodic box of 120 @xmath33 mpc on a side .",
    "then a region centered on a cluster with a mass of @xmath34 was resimulated with a higher resolution in an adaptively refined manner .",
    "the size of the refined region is @xmath35 .",
    "the mean interparticle separation and the dark matter particle mass in the refined region are 117 @xmath33 kpc comoving and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "star particles are created according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "their typical mass is @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation includes a metagalactic uv background @xcite , shielding of uv radiation by neutral hydrogen @xcite and metallicity - dependent radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "while supernova feedback is modeled following @xcite , agn feedback is not included in this simulation .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in this simulation are @xmath38 ( 0.046 , 0.28 , 0.72 , 0.70 , 0.96 , 0.82 ) , following the wmap7-normalized @xmath39cdm model @xcite",
    ".    then a cluster is identified and the cubic box of a side of @xmath40 mpc surrounding the entire cluster is extracted from the simulation data . the dark matter and stars",
    "are represented by particles , and the temperature and density of gas are given on the 520@xmath41 grids ( the grid length is @xmath42 ) .",
    "the radius @xmath43 of the cluster is @xmath44 kpc ( @xmath43 is defined so that the mean density inside @xmath43 is 500 times the critical density of the universe ) .",
    "the center - of - mass velocity of the cluster within @xmath43 is set to vanish .",
    "the total mass @xmath45 within @xmath43 is @xmath46 .",
    "the average icm temperature at @xmath43 is @xmath2 2 kev , and the circular speed there is @xmath47 km s@xmath48 .",
    "projected surface densities of gas , dark matter and stars on @xmath49-@xmath50 plane are plotted in the left panels of figure [ los ] .",
    "the right panels of figure [ los ] show the three - dimensional view of the three components .",
    "the left ( right ) plots are color - coded according to the surface ( space ) densities normalized by the fraction of each component averaged over the box , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 gas , dark matter and stars ) .",
    "note that the fraction @xmath51 is different from the density parameter @xmath53 because the box is selected preferentially around the cluster .    as is clear from figure [ los ] ,",
    "the gas distribution is smoother but very well traces the underlying dark matter distribution . in contract ,",
    "stars are more significantly concentrated in high density regions , and exhibit numerous small clumps , most of which are not identified / resolved in the gas distribution .",
    "figure [ dens ] plots the radial density and mass profiles of the cluster .",
    "the stellar fraction in the inner region ( @xmath54kpc ) is significantly higher than the typical observed value .",
    "this is a well - known common problem among current high - resolution cosmological simulations , and implies that some important baryon physics including high - energy phenomena and star formation is still missing in the simulation .",
    "we perform the analysis of cluster gas , _ assuming _ that this excessive star densities in the inner region does not affect our conclusions at outer radius .",
    "figure [ vel ] represents velocity fields in @xmath49-@xmath55 , @xmath55-@xmath50 and @xmath50-@xmath49 planes passing through the center of the cluster .",
    "the red / blue arrows have negative / positive radial velocity , showing that the gas in the outer regions ( @xmath56 mpc ) falls toward the center while its direction is randomized in the inner region .",
    "we evaluate the _ effective _ mass terms defined in section 2 for the simulated cluster , which is plotted in figure [ gmass ] ; the left panel shows the mass profiles , while the right panel indicates their fractional contribution to the total mass within the radius .    the total mass @xmath57 is computed by directly summing up all the dark matter and star particles and gas of grids within the sphere of @xmath29 .",
    "the other terms , @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , require the pressure and velocity fields evaluated at @xmath29 .",
    "for that purpose , we use the density , velocity and temperature of gas defined at 520@xmath41 original grid points , and first bin the cluster into 50 logarithmically equal radial intervals between 901900 @xmath33 kpc , 10 @xmath58 10 linearly equal angular intervals .",
    "integrands of equations ( [ mthe ] ) , ( [ mrote ] ) and ( [ mstre ] ) are calculated in each bin .",
    "derivatives of the physical variables such as @xmath59 are calculated as follows ; first @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are computed from the difference of the adjacent the original cartesian grid points .",
    "then @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 in our spherical coordinates are calculated applying the chain rule .    in this way , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are computed by integrating the corresponding integrands evaluated above .",
    "finally we estimate @xmath24 simply from the residual of @xmath27 , since we have the cluster data at @xmath69 alone . this estimate for @xmath24 may be different from the original defintion , i.e. , equation ( [ macce ] ) .",
    "indeed when we attempted to compute @xmath24 directly from the box mentioned in section 3 , it turned out to be too small to obtain a correct gravitational potential for the entire cluster .",
    "thus we go back to a larger simulation box of a side of 22.5 @xmath33 mpc and the grid length of 29.34 @xmath33 kpc that encloses our cluster .",
    "then we compute the gravitational potential using fft to obtain the gas acceleration at each grid point .",
    "this enables us to directly calculate @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ macc ] is a comparison of @xmath24 s calculated by two methods .",
    "the directly calculated @xmath24 ( magenta line ) is in good agreement with @xmath70 ( black line ) , although there is a large difference between the two within @xmath71 kpc . also , we make sure that the sum @xmath72 reproduces @xmath8 within @xmath2 2 % except for the innermost region ( @xmath54 kpc ) , where it deviates from @xmath8 by up to @xmath2 9 % . thus the estimation of @xmath24 by @xmath70 is sufficiently good given the quoted errors of our conclusion below .",
    "although it seems better to use @xmath24 directly calculated from equation ( [ macce ] ) , the grid size of the larger box is so coarse that we can not take advantage of the high resolution of the simulations in this study .",
    "therefore , we decided to use the smaller box explained in section 3 and @xmath24 is calculated by @xmath70 in the following analysis .",
    "the left panel of figure [ gmass ] implies that @xmath20 agrees with @xmath8 reasonably well .",
    "each of the other three terms contributes less than 10 % of the total mass ( the dotted curves correspond to the case in which each term becomes negative and its absolute value is plotted instead ) .    in order to consider the validity of hse more quantitatively",
    ", we plot the fractional contribution of each mass term in the right panel of figure [ gmass ] .",
    "the rotation term , @xmath22 , is always positive ( by definition ) and contributes approximately 10 % almost independently of radius .",
    "in contrast , the streaming velocity term , @xmath23 , is mostly negative , and varies a lot at different radial bins . as a result , the difference of the total mass @xmath8 and the hse mass @xmath20 is mostly explained by the acceleration term @xmath24 alone ; compare the black and magenta curves in the right panel of figure [ gmass ] . at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the deviation from hse in terms of the mass difference",
    "@xmath75 is about 10 % .",
    "nevertheless the value significantly varies at different radii and it is safe to conclude that @xmath75 ranges approximately 10 - 20 % at @xmath76 .",
    "also there is no systematic trend of the validity of the hse assumption as a function of radius . even though the reliability of the simulation is suspicious for @xmath77kpc due to the excessive stellar concentration ( section 3.1 ) , @xmath75 fluctuates between @xmath78 % and @xmath79 % for @xmath80",
    "thus there is no guarantee that hse becomes a better approximation toward the inner central region .    physically speaking",
    ", @xmath81 corresponds to the term intergrating the lagrangian derivative of the gas velocity over the sphere .",
    "therefore the fact that it is small compared with @xmath20 and @xmath8 is simply translated into the condition of hse that the gas acceleration from a lagrangian point of view is negligible compared with the pressure gradient and the total gravity .",
    "since we analyze a single simulated cluster , it is not clear to what extent our interpretation that @xmath24 determines the departure from hse holds in general .",
    "thus we use a different set of sph simulation clusters @xcite kindly provided by klaus dolag . for these clusters ,",
    "we assume spherical symmetry and do not divide the spherical surface at a given radius just for simplicity .",
    "klaus dolag also provides us with @xmath24 directly computed from the acceleration data .",
    "we find that in most cases @xmath82 is larger than @xmath22 and @xmath83 especially where @xmath20 deviates from @xmath8 . we also confirm that @xmath72 reproduces @xmath8 within @xmath84 % for most regions ( see appendix c ) .",
    "the above results basically support our conclusion for the cluster from the amr simulations , but we do not have a statistical discussion including clusters from the sph simulations because of the differences in resolutions and simulation methods . instead , we divide the amr cluster into two regions ; upper and lower hemispheres with respect to the @xmath49-@xmath55 plane . then we duplicate each hemisphere into one cluster .",
    "we call the synthetic cluster constructed from the @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) hemisphere `` z+ '' ( `` z- '' ) .",
    "although these clusters are of course not independent of the original cluster and we can not make a statistical argument on their properties , we can briefly look at the effects of substructures or inhomogeneity of temperature and velocity field .",
    "we repeat the same analysis on these two synthetic clusters , and the results are plotted in figure [ zpm ] .",
    "the amplitudes of the different terms vary significantly between the two clusters , and the degree of the validity of hse is also very different .",
    "nevertheless the generic trend is clear ; the relation of @xmath87 holds almost independently of @xmath29 .",
    "it is not clear , however , why the two hemispheres have so different values of @xmath88 ; hse holds very well for `` z+ '' , while it is not the case for `` z- '' .",
    "the visual inspection of figure [ los ] does not reveal any significant difference between the two .",
    "it may be because some local concentrations of dark matter enhance the acceleration / deceleration of gas , and influence the overall non - sphericity of the gas density .",
    "thus the analysis taking account of the ellipticity may provide a deeper insight on the validity of hse , but is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we have examined the validity of hse that has been conventionally assumed in estimating the mass of galaxy clusters from x - ray observations .",
    "we use a simulated cluster and evaluate several mass terms directly corresponding to the euler equations that govern the gas dynamics .",
    "we find that the mass estimated under the hse assumption , @xmath20 in the present study , deviates from the true mass @xmath8 on average by @xmath89 % fractionally for @xmath76 .",
    "there is no clear tendency that the hse becomes a better approximation toward the inner region .",
    "more importantly , we find that @xmath90 is nearly identical to @xmath24 , in other words , the validity of hse is controlled by the amount of gas acceleration .",
    "this trend is confirmed by the separate analysis of the different hemispheres of the same simulated cluster .",
    "our current analysis is limited to a single simulated cluster , but the overall conclusion that the hse mass agrees with the total mass within ( 10 - 20)% is consistent with previous results by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the interpretation of the origin of the departure from hse is very different .",
    "@xcite concluded that the gas rotation term @xmath22 makes a significant contribution and that @xmath91 well reproduces the total mass , especially for relaxed clusters .",
    "it is not the case , however , for our simulated cluster at least .",
    "similarly @xcite found the similar degree of the departure from hse , but they ascribed the discrepancy to the random gas motion .",
    "their analysis , however , is based on the modification of the jeans equations , which does not appear to be justified for the analysis of the gas dynamics , and thus their conclusion should be interpreted with caution .",
    "a relatively small systematic error of the hse mass inferred from current numerical simulations may be partly ascribed to the assumptions inherent in the euler equations , i.e. , local thermal equilibrium and negligible viscosity ( appendix a ) .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the error in the mass estimated from the random motion of collisionless particles tends to be much greater at large radii ( appendix b ) because the relaxation time scale for collisionless particles are appreciably longer than that for collisional gas .",
    "we should also note that the hse mass can be influenced by other physical precesses that are not included in the numerical simulations , such as pressure support from micro - turbulence , the magnetic field , and accelerated particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the neglected components mentioned above are closely linked with one another ( e.g. , viscosity can play a role in generating turbulence and the magnetic field can affect both thermalization and acceleration of gas particles ) and will be investigated in the near future by x - ray missions such as nustar and astro - h as well as by radio telescopes including evla and lofar .",
    "the present analysis is fairly idealized in a sense that the evaluation of all the mass terms has been done from the full three dimensional data of simulated clusters . in reality",
    "observational data of x - ray clusters are basically projected along the line of sight .",
    "therefore additional uncertainties and systematic errors may become important as well .",
    "also it is necessary to carry out the current analysis for a number of clusters in order to obtain the statistically robust conclusion .",
    "these issues will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for useful comments , in particular on the role of the unthermalized gas component as discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "we also thank klaus dolag for kindly providing us with sph simulation data and calculating the gas acceleration , and fujihiro hamba for a useful comment on the interpretation of the inertial term in the euler equations .",
