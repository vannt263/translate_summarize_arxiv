    "in contrast to solid state systems , laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams allow for more precise and accurate observation of the internal dynamics of the landau levels because they are generated in the rather controlled environment of a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) .    among other techniques , electron vortex beams with helical wavefront carrying a large orbital angular momentum ( as lg beams )",

    "when lg beams propagate along the direction of a uniform magnetic field , they behave as stable solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "lg beams correspond in fact to the fock - darwin states that in turn are stationary solutions of the shrdinger equation of a 2d charged particle in a magnetic field .",
    "thereby most of their features remain constant and , as for their optical counterparts , the beam profile is maintained as electrons propagate . among these quantities , the oam is preserved .",
