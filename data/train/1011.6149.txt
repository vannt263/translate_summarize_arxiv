    "superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon .",
    "one of the experimental evidences of this is quantum oscillations in superconducting structures . in 1962 ,",
    "little and parks @xcite observed resistance oscillations for a thin - walled superconducting cylinder in a magnetic field .",
    "the period of oscillations corresponded to the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "more recently , when advances in technology allowed fairly small planar superconducting structures to be manufactured , similar oscillations were observed for superconducting rings . according to the generally accepted views @xcite ,",
    "periodic resistance changes are caused by periodic changes in the allowed value of the velocity of superconducting pairs @xmath0 , @xmath1 corresponding to the lowest energy , that is , to the smallest @xmath2 value .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the mass of the superconducting pair , @xmath4 is an integer that determines the quantized value of pair momentum circulation along ring circles or cylinder section of length @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the total magnetic flux inside circle @xmath5 , and @xmath7 is the flux quantum .",
    "the amplitude of resistance oscillations @xmath8 is proportional to the square of the ratio between the correlation length @xmath9 of the superconductor and the radius @xmath10 of the ring @xcite .",
    "for this reason , little - parks oscillations are largely observed for aluminum @xcite characterized by the largest correlation length .    in @xcite , the effect of alternating current rectification",
    "was observed for asymmetric aluminum rings at tem - peratures close to the superconducting transition tem - perature , @xmath11 the sign and magnitude of rectified voltage @xmath12 periodically changed in a magnetic field with a period corresponding to the flux quantum @xmath13 inside the ring .",
    "obviously , this effect , like little - parks resistance @xmath8 oscillations , was caused by the quantization of velocity ( 1 ) of superconducting pairs in the ring .",
    "the periodic dependences of rectified voltage @xmath12 always intersected zero at magnetic flux values multiple to the flux quantum , @xmath14 and half the flux quantum , @xmath15 this corresponded to the expected dependence of the mean thermodynamic value of the velocity of superconducting pairs in the ring , @xmath16 .",
    "because the energy difference between the allowed velocity ( 1 ) values in a real superconducting ring is much larger than the energy of thermal fluctuations @xcite , the mean quantum number value @xmath17 is close to the integer value @xmath18 corresponding to the allowed state with minimum energy , that is , the minimum @xmath2 value . an exception is magnetic fluxes close to @xmath15 , at which two states with opposite velocity directions have equal energies , @xmath19 for this reason , @xmath16 is zero at both @xmath14 and @xmath15 although the state with zero velocity is , according to ( 1 ) , forbidden at @xmath15     example of microstructures used in measurements .",
    "two asymmetric rings with current and voltage contacts are shown .",
    "the widths of the half circles of the upper ring are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and those of the lower ring , @xmath22 and @xmath20 . ]",
    "the observation of rectified voltage @xmath12 quantum oscillations @xcite presupposes that the current - voltage characteristics of an asymmetric ring should be asymmetric at @xmath23 and @xmath24 and that this asymmetry should change periodically in a magnetic field .",
    "our measurements showed that this asymmetry was caused by critical current anisotropy , that is , the difference of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 values measured in opposite directions at which the transition to the resistive state is observed .",
    "periodic changes in the sign and magnitude of critical current anisotropy @xmath27 explain periodic changes in rectified voltage .",
    "we found that the periodic magnetic field dependences of the critical current measured in opposite directions are close in shape but shifted by @xmath28 with respect to each other , @xmath29 the critical current anisotropy equal @xmath30 according to ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is largely caused by the shift @xmath28 .    in this work we present the results obtained in studies of the dependence of the shift @xmath28 on ring anisotropy .",
    "for this purpose , we measured quantum oscillations of the critical currents @xmath31 and @xmath32 in rings with different asymmetries , that is , with different ratios between half circle widths , and in symmetrical rings with equal half circle widths .",
    "these rings were also used to measure resistance @xmath8 and rectified voltage @xmath12 oscillations .",
    "we used film aluminum nanostructures with the superconducting transition temperature @xmath33 , resistance per square of approximately @xmath34 at 4.2 k , and the resistance ratio @xmath35 .",
    "measurements were taken over the temperature range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",

    "the microstructures were prepared on silicon sub - strates using a jeol-840a electron microscope , which was transformed into a laboratory electron lithograph with the use of the nanomaker package .",
    "measurements were taken by the four - probe method ( fig .",
    "1 ) in a glass helium cryostat using @xmath53 as a coolant .",
    "the temperature could be decreased to @xmath54 by pumping helium off .",
    "the temperature was measured by a calibrated thermal resistance ( @xmath55 ) with a @xmath56 measuring current . magnetic field * b * perpendicular to the plane of the sample was created by a copper solenoid situated outside the cryostat .",
    "the dependences of values on the current @xmath57 through the solenoid were recorded . the magnetic field created by a current in the solenoid",

    "the period @xmath60 of all periodic dependences @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 corresponded to the area @xmath64 of the ring used for measurements ; here , @xmath65 is a value close to the inside ring radius . to decrease the magnetic field of the earth",
    ", the cryostat region with the sample was screened by a permalloy cylinder .",
    "the residual magnetic field was @xmath66 , that is , approximately one tenth of the @xmath67 period .",
    "the magnetic field dependences of the critical currents @xmath68 and @xmath69 were determined by measuring periodically repeating current - voltage characteristics ( a period of 10 hz ) in a slowly varying magnetic field @xmath70 ( a period of approximately 0.01 hz ) as follows .",
    "first , the condition that the structure was in the superconducting state was checked .",
    "next , after the threshold voltage was exceeded ( this voltage , set above induced voltages and noises of the measuring system , determined the minimum measurable critical current ) , magnetic field and critical current ( with a delay of about @xmath71 ) were switched on .",
    "this procedure allowed us to measure sequentially critical currents in the positive @xmath25 and negative @xmath26 directions with respect to the external measuring current @xmath72 .",
    "measurements of one @xmath68 or @xmath69 dependence ( 1000 values ) took about 100 s. little - parks oscillations @xmath73 were recorded at a constant @xmath74 current .",
    "the field dependences of rectified voltage @xmath62 were measured using sinusoidal current @xmath75 with the amplitude @xmath76 up to @xmath77 and frequency @xmath78 . because of incomplete screening , the minima of the @xmath79 solenoid field dependences of resistance and zero rectified voltage @xmath80 were shifted by @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath82 dependences had minima at @xmath83 and maxima at @xmath84 and the @xmath85 dependences intersected zero at these values of the total magnetic field @xmath86 . because the simultaneous reversal of the total external field * b * and measuring current @xmath72 was equivalent to rotation through @xmath87 , the equality @xmath88 had to be satisfied",
    ". we had @xmath89 for all the dependences measured .",
    "this proves that @xmath86 was the total external field also in critical current measurements .",

    "we therefore used the approximation @xmath103 the dependences measured are represented as functions of the magnetic flux inside rings , @xmath104 created by external fields @xmath86 .",
    "the exact @xmath105 value was selected using the condition that the periods of oscillations of the @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 values should equal the flux quantum @xmath102 .",

    "the shifted dependence @xmath113 is also shown ( light squares ) . ]",
    "clearly , the magnitudes and magnetic field depen - dences of the critical currents measured in opposite directions for an absolutely symmetrical ring should coincide @xmath114 , because rotation through @xmath87 about the magnetic field direction should not then cause any changes .",
    "our measurements showed that such dependences measured for rings with half circles of equal widths @xmath115 , @xmath49 were close to each other ( fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath116 the closest coincidence was , however , observed when one of the dependences was shifted by @xmath117 of the flux quantum .",
    "the absence of the exact equality @xmath114 is likely evidence that the rings used were not absolutely symmetrical .",
    "measurements for rings with controlled asymmetry showed that even comparatively small asymmetry , @xmath47 ( half circles of widths @xmath46 and @xmath40 ) resulted in a maximum relative shift @xmath118 of the dependences of the critical currents measured in the opposite directions ( fig .",
    "3 ) , @xmath119 this shift remained unchanged as the @xmath120 ratio of ring section areas increased from 1.25 to 2.00 ( fig .",
    "dependence of the shift @xmath28 at which the closest coincidence of critical current oscillations @xmath121 measured in the opposite directions is observed on ring anisotropy . at equal half circle widths ( @xmath115 ) , the shift is @xmath122 but narrowing of even a short ( @xmath123 ) portion of one of half circles with semicircumference length @xmath124 from 0.4 to 0.3 @xmath125 increases the shift to @xmath126 . at a @xmath47 ratio between half circle widths ( @xmath46 and @xmath40 ) , the shift reaches @xmath127 . it remains unchanged as the @xmath128 ratio increases above 1.25 . ]",
    "the shift @xmath28 was also independent of the measuring current .",
    "over the temperature range studied , the critical current changed by a factor of 10 ( from 3 to 30 @xmath129 ) and the closest coincidence of the @xmath121 dependences was always observed at @xmath130 . for absolutely symmetrical rings , @xmath114 , and",
    "the result obtained therefore means that the appearance of ring asymmetry shifts the dependences of the critical current ( to opposite sides for measurements in the opposite directions ) by @xmath131 , or a quarter of the flux quantum at @xmath132 .",
    "this shift of the dependences is responsible for the critical current anisotropy ( 4 ) and the effect of alternating current rectification ( fig .",
    "5 ) observed in asymmetric rings @xcite .",
    "the existence of the shift , however , contradicts both the dependence of the velocity of superconducting pairs corresponding to quantization condition ( 1 ) and the results of measurements of resistance oscillations for asymmetric rings .",
    "clearly , the rectification effect can not be observed in an absolutely symmetrical ring , where @xmath114 .",
    "all the existing concepts of quantum effects in superconductors lead us to suggest that the rectification effect observed for asymmetric rings @xcite is caused by a change ( resulting from ring asymmetry ) in the functions that describe the magnetic field dependence of the critical current .",
    "our measurements , however , show that the equality of the critical currents measured in the opposite directions changes for their inequality because of changes in the arguments of the functions rather than the functions themselves , @xmath133 this is a very strange result , because the periodic @xmath31 and @xmath32 dependences are actually functions of @xmath134 .",
    "quantum oscillations in magnetic field of critical currents @xmath25 , @xmath26 , critical current anisotropy @xmath135 , and rectified voltage @xmath136 measured for an asymmetric ring ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) at @xmath137 . ]    the shift of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 dependences might have a trivial explanation similar to that valid for the extrema of the dependences of the critical current in asymmetric superconducting quantum interferometers @xcite if the flux @xmath100 created by the measuring current in asymmetric rings , see ( 6 ) , was fairly large and the shift value @xmath28 depended on the asymmetry value @xmath138 and current @xmath72 .",
    "but the small @xmath100 value and the independence of the shift value from ring asymmetry ( fig .",
    "4 ) and critical current ( fig .",
    "3 ) show this explanation to be inapplicable and are evidence that the total flux in the ring ( 5 ) insignificantly differs from the @xmath95 flux created by the external magnetic field .",
    "this means that the change in the arguments of the @xmath139 and @xmath140 functions observed as the ring becomes asymmetric can only be related to a change in the quantum number @xmath4 .",
    "quantum oscillations in magnetic field of resistance @xmath141 at @xmath142 and critical currents @xmath25 , @xmath26 , measured in the opposite directions at @xmath143 for symmetrical ( 1 ) , @xmath90 , and asymmetric ( 2 ) , @xmath44 and @xmath40 , rings . ]",
    "the reason for the periodic character of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 dependences for both symmetrical and asymmetric rings can be no other than periodic changes in the velocity of superconducting pairs , whose allowed values are determined by quantization condition ( 1 ) .",
    "maxima of the dependences @xmath114 recorded for symmetrical rings correspond to @xmath14 and minima , to @xmath15 that is , to zero and maximum velocity modulus values at the lowest level allowed by condition ( 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 dependences remain periodic in asymmetric rings , but the positions of their extrema shift by @xmath144 .",
    "seemingly , this should mean @xmath144 shifts in the positions of the extrema of the modulus of the velocity of superconducting pairs as the ring becomes asymmetric .",
    "this suggestion , however , contradicts the results of little - parks resistance oscillation measurements performed by us for the same asymmetric rings .",
    "it is generally recognized @xcite that resistance oscillations are a consequence of oscillations of the square of the velocity of superconducting pairs , @xmath145 accordingly and in agreement with quantization condition ( 1 ) , @xmath146 dependence minima and maxima are observed at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "our measurements showed ( fig .",
    "6 ) that ring asymmetry caused no shift of the @xmath8 function extrema .",
    "to summarize , our experiments revealed a contradiction between the results of resistance oscillation @xmath8 measurements and the behavior of critical currents @xmath31 and @xmath32 in asymmetric superconducting rings .",
    "ring asymmetry does not cause shifts of @xmath8 extrema for resistance oscillations , whereas , for critical current oscillations , the extrema of the dependences @xmath31 and @xmath32 shift by @xmath144 .",
    "this result was obtained for all the rings studied with asymmetry @xmath147 .",
    "this contradiction remains an open question , because resistance and critical current oscillations can not be caused by anything other than quantization ( 1 ) of the velocity of superconducting pairs .",
    "we are led to conclude that shifts of magnetic field dependences of the critical current observed in this work as superconducting ring asymmetry appears is a very strange and inexplicable phenomenon .",
    "note that this result is absolutely reliable experimentally and can not be an artifact . although we were unable to prepare an absolutely symmetrical ring",
    ", the difference between the shifts equal to @xmath117 in rings with @xmath49 and @xmath118 in rings with @xmath147 is evidence that the observed change in the arguments of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 functions can not be an artifact .",
    "we also obtained a shift of an intermediate value , @xmath148 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . to create asymmetry smaller than @xmath149 , we prepared a ring with equal half circle widths of @xmath150 along the major portion of their lengths @xmath151 and a narrowing to along a short segment of length @xmath152 in one half circle .",
    "such small but controlled asymmetry gave a shift of @xmath148 , which was substantially larger than the shift @xmath153 for rings with uncontrolled asymmetry .",
    "the shift @xmath117 observed for rings prepared as symmetrical is evidence of high accuracy of measurements of the difference between @xmath134 arguments in symmetrical and asymmetric rings .",
    "such a high accuracy is a result of both the method used to measure the @xmath31 and @xmath32 dependences and periodic character of these functions .",
    "measurements of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ... values at successive time moments exclude the possibility of the influence of magnetic field measurement errors on the accuracy of @xmath154 values .",
    "we observed up to 30 periods of oscillations , which allowed us to determine @xmath154 with high accuracy .",
    "all this is evidence that dependence shifts as rings become asymmetric are an unambiguous experimental fact .",
    "it only remains for us to hope that this strange fact will be explained sometime .",
