    "several exact solutions of einstein s equations have been published which describe an impulsive spherical gravitational wave in a minkowski background generated , either by a snapping cosmic string ( identified by a deficit angle ) , or by an expanding string inside the sphere .",
    "the first such solution was presented independently by both gleiser and pullin  @xcite and bik and schmidt  @xcite .",
    "the first of these @xcite was obtained by pasting two appropriate forms of minkowski space either side of the spherical wavefront , while the second @xcite was obtained as a limiting case of a solution with boost - rotation symmetry . in this case ,",
    "two null particles recede from a common point generating an impulsive spherical gravitational wave and there are either cosmic strings attaching each particle to infinity , or there is an expanding cosmic string along the axis of symmetry separating the two particles .",
    "however , as pointed out by bik  @xcite , this solution does not strictly describe a snapping cosmic string , but two semi - infinite cosmic strings initially approaching at the speed of light and then separating again at the instant at which they collide .",
    "in fact a general method for constructing expanding impulsive spherical gravitational waves had previously been presented by penrose @xcite .",
    "this involves cutting minkowski space - time along a null cone and then re - attaching the two pieces with a suitable `` warp '' .",
    "the explicit general solution written in a continuous coordinate system was given by nutku and penrose  @xcite and hogan @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the above solutions describing `` snapping cosmic strings '' are included within this family .",
    "these solutions have been extended @xcite to include a cosmological constant . with this",
    "they describe expanding spherical gravitational waves in de  sitter and anti - de  sitter backgrounds .",
    "further , the general class of solutions of this type has been shown @xcite to be equivalent to impulsive limits of the robinson ",
    "trautman type  n class of solutions .",
    "finally , it may be mentioned that hortasu and his colleagues @xcite@xcite have considered aspects of particle creation in these backgrounds .",
    "it may be noted that hogan  @xcite has also considered imploding - exploding gravitational waves . in this",
    "he has simply attached an impulsive wave on a past null cone to one on a future null cone without considering the necessary sources of the wave . outside the cone",
    ", a snapping string must evolve continuously .",
    "however , this construction does permit a string inside an expanding cone to be different from one inside the prior imploding cone , although the singular event at which the two cones join would then require some physical justification .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to describe the penrose method and its interpretation in detail and in full generality , using alternative spatial sections and including an arbitrary cosmological constant .",
    "this will enable us to construct an exact solution which describes the gravitational wave that would be generated by the collision ( and consequent breaking ) of a pair of moving cosmic strings in a minkowski background .",
    "such a situation was outlined in @xcite .",
    "the explicit solution is given in section  vi .",
    "as mentioned above , penrose @xcite has described a `` cut and paste '' method for constructing an expanding spherical gravitational wave in a minkowski background . in this method , appropriate junction conditions across the null cone guarantee that the vacuum field equations are satisfied .",
    "however , there is an impulsive component in the weyl tensor representing an impulsive gravitational wave located on this null cone .",
    "the above procedure will now be performed explicitly . however , for later convenience , we will derive a more general form of the solution for an impulsive spherical wave in a minkowski background than that outlined in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will also include a cosmological constant @xmath0 , so that the resulting solutions will also describe expanding spherical impulsive waves in de  sitter and anti - de  sitter backgrounds . in this approach ,",

    "notice that the transformation ( [ transe3 ] ) and ( [ transe4 ] ) reduces to ( [ inv ] ) when @xmath20 .    in the coordinates of both line elements ( [ u<0 ] ) and ( [ u>0 ] ) , the null hypersurface  @xmath21  represents a null cone ( an expanding sphere ) in the background .",
    "moreover , the reduced 2-metrics on this cone are identical . following penrose s `` cut and paste '' method @xcite",
    ", we may take the line element ( [ u<0 ] ) for @xmath22 and attach this to ( [ u>0 ] ) for @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting line element can then be written in the combined form @xmath24 ^ 2 } ,   \\label{ln0en0}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this combined metric , which was presented for a minkowski background in @xcite-@xcite , with a cosmological constant in @xcite , and in the most general form in @xcite , is explicitly continuous everywhere , including across the null hypersurface @xmath21 .",
    "however , the discontinuity in the derivatives of the metric yields impulsive components in the curvature tensor proportional to the dirac @xmath26-function .",
    "it may be observed that the penrose junction conditions can be obtained by comparing the transformations ( [ inv ] ) at @xmath27 with ( [ transe3][transe4 ] ) at @xmath28 .",
    "this gives the identification @xmath29 where the space - time has been divided into two halves @xmath30 inside the null cone , and @xmath31 outside .",

    "it also confirms that the space - time is vacuum everywhere except on the wave surface at @xmath35 and at possible singularities of the function @xmath36 .",
    "it may be observed that the metric ( [ u<0 ] ) contains a coordinate singularity at @xmath35 .",
    "however , this becomes a physical singularity on the wave surface @xmath21 in the above construction .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath37 , @xmath35 is a singular null _ line _ on the surface @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , as seen from ( [ inv ] ) , this is a common line ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) to all the null cones @xmath8  const .",
    "thus , for @xmath37 , there is a singular line on the wave surface where @xmath35 , in addition to possible singular points of @xmath40 . for a physical interpretation of these solutions ,",
    "it would be better to remove the singularity @xmath35 from the wavefront . this can be achieved by considering solutions with @xmath41 . for these cases , as observed by hogan  @xcite , the family of null cones @xmath8  const .",
    "have vertices on a timelike line ( @xmath42 ) if @xmath43 and on a spacelike line ( @xmath44 ) if @xmath45 .",
    "for either of these cases , the singularity at @xmath35 appears only at the vertex of the null cone @xmath46 , which may be considered as the `` origin '' of the spherical wave .",
    "significantly , the construction of the spherical impulsive wave as described above admits an interesting geometrical interpretation .",
    "specifically , the ratio @xmath47 is the well known relation for a stereographic ( one - to - one ) correspondence between a sphere and an argand plane by a projection from the north pole onto a plane through the equator ( see chapter  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this permits us to represent the wave surface @xmath21 ( taken at a typical or rescaled time @xmath48 ) either as a riemann sphere , or as its associated complex plane .",
    "conversely , any point @xmath49 on the complex plane , taken as @xmath50 , identifies a unique point @xmath51 on the sphere with coordinates @xmath52 in terms of standard spherical coordinates , @xmath53 .    we may also recall some important properties of the stereographic projection .",
    "any circle on the riemann sphere maps to a circle in the complex argand plane , and vice versa . as a special case , any circle passing through the north pole of the riemann sphere maps to a straight line in the complex plane . a great circle which passes through the north pole maps to a straight line through the origin of the plane .",
    "we also note that the stereographic projection is conformal , i.e. angle preserving .    returning to the impulsive spherical wave",
    ", we observe from ( [ inv ] ) and ( [ transe3][transe4 ] ) that on @xmath21 @xmath54 this permits us to represent the penrose junction condition ( [ junct ] ) across the wave surface as a mapping on the complex argand plane @xmath55 .",
    "this is equivalent to mapping points @xmath56 on the `` inside '' of the wave surface to the identified points @xmath57 on the `` outside '' , see fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "normally , we will assume that the `` inside '' represented by @xmath14 covers the complete sphere , but the function @xmath58 will not generally cover the entire sphere on the `` outside '' .",
    "the restrictions on the range of the function @xmath58 together with its specific character will correspond to particular physical situations as will be described below .",
    "for the sake of completeness , the results of these two sections have been given with an arbitrary cosmological constant included .",
    "however , for the remainder of this paper , we will only consider the case when @xmath59 .",
    "the utility of the above geometrical approach may be demonstrated by the simplest and physically interesting case of an impulsive spherical wave generated by a `` snapping cosmic string '' . without loss of generality",
    ", the string may be taken to be located along the @xmath60-axis perpendicular to the above complex plane .",
    "it may be noted that the initial gleiser ",
    "pullin  @xcite solution describing this situation was presented in a slightly different form to that given above . essentially , it employed two different constant non - zero values of @xmath40 in the regions inside and outside the spherical wave .",
    "this is effectively equivalent to taking @xmath61 for @xmath22 and @xmath62 for @xmath23 , where @xmath26 is a real positive constant .    here",
    "we will describe the same solution .",
    "however we will use the above notation as also presented by nutku and penrose  @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath59 , the line element ( [ ln0en0 ] ) becomes    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath7 are given by ( [ pandep ] ) .    according to the above construction ( [ xi ] ) , in the interior region @xmath22 , the complete spherical surface is covered by @xmath65 .",
    "it is then appropriate to represent the outer region @xmath23 by @xmath66 where @xmath67 putting @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 covers the plane minus a wedge , e.g. @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "this represents minkowski space with a deficit angle @xmath72 and may be considered to describe a cosmic string in the region outside the spherical wave as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] .",
    "( alternatively , if @xmath73 and the exterior region may be taken to be complete and the range of @xmath74 reduced so that the deficit angle representing the string appears inside the sphere . ) outside the spherical wavefront , the string may be taken to be located along the axis @xmath75 .",
    "then , by putting @xmath76 , it may be observed from ( [ transe3 ] ) that , for the particular function @xmath70 , @xmath77 .",
    "thus , _ the deficit angle is constant _ along the length of the string , corresponding to a constant tension .    for the case",
    "when @xmath78 , the metric function @xmath79 in ( [ l=0en0 ] ) is given by @xmath80 this indicates a singular point at @xmath81 , which is located at the south pole of the spherical wavefront .",
    "however , there is an additional singularity at @xmath35 which , for @xmath37 , is located at the north pole at any time @xmath82 . as suggested at the end of section ii , a much better physical interpretation can be given to the @xmath41 solutions of the form ( [ l=0en0 ] ) . for @xmath83 ,",
    "the physical singularity at @xmath35 appears only in the vertex of the conical impulsive surface @xmath21 at @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , according to ( [ psi4 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) @xmath85 therefore , there is a divergence not only at the south pole where @xmath81 given by @xmath86 , but also at the north pole where @xmath87 given by @xmath88 .",
    "both these divergences are equivalent and indicate particles of _ equal _ `` mass '' at the two ends of the string .",
    "at this point , let us consider a space - time given by the line element ( [ l=0en0 ] ) for some particular function @xmath40 and observe that it can best be interpreted by first calculating the associated function @xmath58 .",
    "this can be achieved by integrating the three first order equations following ( [ u>0 ] ) . however , the resulting function is not unique as it contains three complex constants of integration .",
    "in fact , this arbitrariness corresponds to the freedom associated with the lorentz transformations @xmath89 where @xmath90 are arbitrary complex constants satisfying the complex condition @xmath91 .",
    "it is well known that this is the most general _ global _ holomorphic ( i.e. analytic and conformal ) transformation of the riemann sphere to itself ( see chapter  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "it may also be noted that the schwarzian derivative ( [ schwarz ] ) , i.e. @xmath92 , is invariant under this transformation .",
    "in particular , a rotation about an arbitrary direction can be given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 are the euler angles .",
    "we will adopt the following construction : first we perform a rotation through @xmath95 about the @xmath60-axis , then we rotate through @xmath96 about the original @xmath97-direction , and finally we perform a rotation through @xmath74 about the original @xmath60-axis .",
    "this moves the north pole to a point on the sphere given by the spherical coordinates @xmath98 .    of the remaining lorentz transformations , a boost in the @xmath60-direction with velocity @xmath99",
    "is given simply by @xmath100 where @xmath101 , which corresponds to a uniform expansion in the complex plane .",
    "it leaves invariant both the poles of the riemann sphere . also , the null rotation @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is complex , is a uniform translation in the complex plane .",
    "it leaves invariant only the north pole of the riemann sphere .",
    "these are well described with useful pictures in chapter  1 of @xcite .",
    "by combining operations of the type given in ( [ h1 ] ) , which introduces a deficit angle , with suitable lorentz transformations , we can generate much more general solutions with predetermined physical properties .",
    "in particular , we can use this technique to construct an explicit solution describing the situation outlined by nutku and penrose  @xcite in which _ two cosmic strings collide and split _ generating an impulsive spherical gravitational wave .",
    "it is assumed that two strings are initially moving with constant velocity and approach each other .",
    "of course , provided they are not parallel , it is always possible to make a lorentz transformation to a frame of reference in which the two cosmic strings are orthogonal .",
    "there is therefore no loss of generality in considering only orthogonal strings .",
    "it is also assumed that both strings snap at their point of intersection and that the snapped ends propagate along the length of the string at the speed of light .",
    "this will generate an impulsive spherical gravitational wave .",
    "we start with the simplest situation in which two orthogonal strings approach each other with a negligible velocity .",
    "the solution for such a situation can be constructed as follows .",
    "starting with ( [ h1 ] ) , we first apply a rotation ( [ rotation ] ) with @xmath104 .",
    "this leads to @xmath105 , which represents a cosmic string located along the @xmath97-axis .",
    "then we introduce another string in the same way as in ( [ h1 ] ) by taking the @xmath106-th power .",
    "this removes a wedge which represents a second string that is located along the @xmath60-axis and has deficit angle @xmath107 .",
    "the final mapping is given by @xmath108 this solution describes two snapped orthogonal cosmic strings which were at `` relative rest '' initially .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath109 has the form @xmath110 the solution is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] . on the left",
    "there is the complex function @xmath111 in the complex argand plane , on the right the corresponding riemann sphere obtained using the stereographic identification .",
    "as can be seen , there are two perpendicular wedge cuts on the sphere indicating that the flat space outside the spherical impulsive gravitational wave contains two orthogonal pairs of cosmic strings .",
    "this solution thus represents two cosmic strings which snapped at the initial time @xmath84 and at their point of intersection .",
    "we can now similarly construct a more general solution describing a situation in which the two cosmic strings were in finite relative motion before the collision . in this case , the four snapped half - strings are also in relative translational motion .",
    "the more involved construction of such a solution is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.4 ] and [ fig.5 ] .",
    "we start with the initial cut  @xmath112  given by ( [ h1 ] ) introducing the first string with deficit angle @xmath72 along the @xmath60-axis as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] . a subsequent rotation ( [ rotation ] ) with @xmath113 ,",
    "@xmath114 places the initial poles @xmath81 and @xmath87 on the @xmath97-axis with the cut passing through the south pole .",
    "the corresponding function  @xmath115  is illustrated in the complex argand plane in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ]  ( a ) and on the riemann sphere in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ]  ( a ) .",
    "next we make a boost ( [ boost ] ) with @xmath116 in the @xmath60-direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ]  ( b ) and fig .  [ fig.5 ]  ( b ) . then another rotation ( [ rotation ] ) with @xmath117 , @xmath118 about the @xmath97-axis leads to @xmath119 and puts the poles and the cut along the @xmath50 plane , symmetric about the @xmath120-axis , see fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ]  ( c ) and fig .  [ fig.5 ]  ( c ) . at this point",
    "we make a second cut from the north to south poles through the negative @xmath120-axis by taking @xmath121 .",
    "this introduces the second string with deficit angle @xmath107 along the @xmath60-axis as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ]  ( d ) and fig .  [ fig.5 ]  ( d ) .",
    "( note that the function @xmath121 for @xmath122 exactly reduces to the previous form ( [ h2 ] ) with the poles located at @xmath123 and @xmath124 . )",
