    "although the processes involved in single star formation have a wide variety of observational and theoretical constraints , the complex physics involved in the formation of binary and especially multiple star systems is much less understood .",
    "prompt fragmentation of a collapsing prestellar core is favored as setting the initial conditions for multiple star systems , though how this depends upon the initial conditions of the cloud core ( e.g. metallicity , mass , etc . )",
    "is not well understood .",
    "once initial fragments form , subsequent fragmentation ( possibly within a disk ) , accretion from the remnant cloud core , n - body dynamics , and possibly orbital migration have been proposed to play competing roles in setting the final properties of multiple star systems . while the task of identifying the relative importance of these dynamical phenomenon remains daunting , useful constraints",
    "can nevertheless be established by first determining fundamental multiple star properties , such as the overall multiplicity fraction , the distribution of mass ratios , the distribution of separations , and the mass dependence of companion properties . as an example ,",
    "one of the most well - established observational trends is that the fraction of stars in binary systems decreases toward lower stellar masses ; studies of nearby stellar samples reveal that 26@xmath5 of m - dwarfs have companions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) , compared to 46@xmath5 for sun - like stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) .",
    "a likely implication of this is that lower mass cloud cores fragment less often , despite any subsequent dynamical evolution .",
    "formation events that lead to triple , quadruple , and even higher order stellar systems also appear to occur less often at low stellar masses .",
    "emerging statistics are that 2.1@xmath5 of m - dwarfs occur in triple systems , while 0.03@xmath5 occur in quadruple or higher order systems , compared to 5.6@xmath5 of g - dwarfs occurring in triple systems and 2.2@xmath5 occurring in quadruple or higher order systems @xcite . while it is tempting to interpret this as a corresponding decrease in the frequency of multiple fragmentation events with lower cloud core mass , accurate assessments of high - order multiplicity are much more subject to observational biases and incompleteness , especially at low stellar masses . as an example of the incompleteness that exists , @xcite find a surprisingly high fraction of triple and quadruple systems among a targeted sample of 36 extremely wide m - dwarf pairs , formerly known only as wide m - dwarf binary stars ; the results mimic the discovery that brown dwarfs are more often found to be a close binary systems when first identified as a wide companion to a star @xcite .",
    "the most direct way to establish a more complete assessment of the multiplicity fraction over a broad range of masses is to target volume - limited samples of nearby stars .",
    "not only are these the closest , brightest stars with the most precisely determined kinematics , but if trigonometric distances are known , malmquist biases can be avoided .",
    "nevertheless , observational biases remain even for the closest stars . of the 348 stars known within 10 pc , 21 are g - dwarfs and 239",
    "are m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "but while 2 of these 21 g - dwarfs are the primary stars in quadruple star systems ( no higher order g - dwarf systems are known ) , only 1 of the 239 m - dwarfs is the primary of a quintuple star system ; no m - dwarf quadruple star systems are known within 10 pc ( see table  [ table : known ] ) .    the deficiency of known higher order pairs in part stems from a lack of high - dispersion spectroscopy that would reveal short period companions .",
    "early m - dwarfs are faint in the optical and chromospherically active making spectroscopic companion searches observationally difficult .",
    "it becomes even more challenging to search for short period companions around mid to late m - dwarfs with spectroscopy , as these stars are even fainter and tend to have higher projected rotational velocities compared with earlier m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these biases have inhibited good assessments of high order multiples .",
    "for example , of the 90 m - dwarfs included in the spectroscopic companion search by @xcite , only 4 stars have spectral types of m4 or later .",
    "the harps rv sample of 102 southern m - dwarfs only included stars with v@xmath614 mag @xcite . with the ratio of early m - dwarfs ( m0-m4 ) to mid and late m - dwarfs ( m4.5-m9 ) being 23/28 for stars within 5 parsecs",
    "@xcite , about half of all m - dwarfs are left out of high dispersion spectroscopic surveys .    to address the question of m - dwarf multiplicity",
    "more completely , we initiated a volume - limited , astrometric and infrared spectroscopic search for companions with orbital periods between 3 days and 8 years around mid m - dwarfs within 10 parsecs , which includes gj 867b as a target @xcite .",
    "a first result of this work is that gj 867b is revealed to be a short - period spectroscopic binary .",
    "we discuss the known characteristics of the gj 867 system in  2 .",
    "we list the astrometric results in  3 and the photometric results in  4 , and newly assigned spectral types in  5 .",
    "we discuss the spectroscopic results of gj 867b and the new companion , gj 867d , in  6 . in  7 , we summarize the results and discuss the case for physical association of this hierarchical system .",
    "gj 867a ( _ _ v@xmath7__=9.09 mag ; ) is the primary component of a widely separated visual binary .",
    "it was classified spectroscopically by @xcite as an m type star ; we more accurately classify this star as m2.0v ( see section 5 ) .",
    "this star is a member of young disk @xcite .",
    "its visual companion , gj 867b ( _ _ v@xmath7__=11.45 mag ; ) , is separated by 24@xmath35 at a position angle of 350.45@xmath8 , based on 2mass position measurements .",
    "the spectral type of gj 867b is m3.5v ( see section 5 ) .",

    "the two stars are presumed to be physically associated from their large ( @xmath90@xmath345/yr ) and very similar proper motions . nevertheless , the stars have slightly but steadily changed their relative position since first recorded in 1877 with a separation of 21@xmath34 and a position angle ( pa ) of 359@xmath8 , which presumably represents the orbital motion of the system @xcite .",
    "gj 867a was discovered by @xcite to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 4.083 days .",
    "the two components ( a and c ) have an estimated mass ratio ( m@xmath10/m@xmath11 ) of 0.80 based on their relative velocity amplitudes .",
    "gj 867b was identified with high resolution optical spectroscopy as a candidate spectroscopic binary ( sb ) by @xcite , and later was listed as either having a high rotational velocity or being a sb by @xcite . however , until now its status as a short - period binary remained unconfirmed .",
    "direct images of gj 867bd were obtained at the 0.9-m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) from july 2003 until september 2012 , yielding a total of 16 astrometric epochs over 9.17 years .",
    "images were obtained using the 2048 x 2048 tektronix ccd camera on the central quarter of the ccd chip .",
    "the ccd chip has a plate scale of 0.@xmath12401 pixel@xmath1 , which gives a field of view of 6@xmath138 @xmath14 6@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "astrometric measurements of gj 867bd were made in the @xmath16@xmath17 filter , which provided a field of five suitable reference stars .",
    "no astrometric measurements were taken of gj 867ac , as this star saturates before sufficient signal - to - noise ratios are obtained for the reference stars .",
    "each night that gj 867bd was observed we obtained 5 to 10 images , for a total of 96 images on 16 different nights .",
    "exposure times for an individual image varied from 25 to 100 seconds , with an average time of 54 seconds .",
    "we aimed to observe all images within 30 minutes of the star crossing the meridian to minimize the effects of differential color refraction ( dcr ; * ? ? ? * ) . in each image",
    "the fwhm of gj 867bd is less than 2@xmath34 ; this size is typically set by the seeing .",
    "the ellipticity of the target star and all reference stars are less than 20@xmath5 .",
    "these criteria are adopted to eliminate elongated reference stars ( e.g. binaries ) , and to avoid data with tracking / guiding errors .    during the time of observations , two different _ v@xmath18 _ filters were used .",
    "the first _ v@xmath18 _",
    "filter possessed a small crack and was replaced in february 2005 with a nearly identical _",
    "v@xmath18 _ filter , which we confidently adopted knowing that it possessed the same transmission spectrum as the original .",
    "after a few years of obtaining data , we noticed a few milli - arcsecond ( mas ) offset in the astrometric residuals of some stars that were known to be single from other techniques @xcite ; we determined that the offset first appeared when we replaced the _",
    "the effect of using the replacement _",

    "we use all points in this analysis to maximize the parallactic ellipse coverage .      here",
    "we briefly summarize the reduction technique ; further details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we obtain photometric parallaxes using the ccd distance relations of @xcite from which distances are calculated for all of our reference stars .",
    "we require reference stars to be further than 100 parsecs from the sun , and initially assume the sums of all reference stars proper and parallactic motions to be zero mas / yr . we measure the centroid of our target star against the presumed fixed grid of five reference stars using the sextractor centroiding algorithm described in .",
    "relative to this reference grid , we obtain the proper motion , parallax and any residual astrometric motion of the target star using the gaussfit program from @xcite .",
    "we use the photometric parallaxes of the reference stars from our vri photometry and correct for the parallactic motions of our reference stars to determine the absolute parallax of gj 867bd .",
    "we measure a relative parallax for gj 867bd of 109.45 @xmath0 1.74 mas .",
    "the correction for parallactic motion is 0.93 @xmath0 0.20 , yielding a final absolute parallax of 110.38 @xmath0 1.75 mas .",

    "similar to our parallax errors , the systematic error for the proper motion amplitude dominates the error budget .",
    "@xcite measure the @xmath20 of gj 867bd to be 431.2 @xmath0 10.2 mas / yr and the proper motion position angle to be 98.1 degrees , which is within 0.6@xmath19 of our measurement of the @xmath20 of gj 867bd ; they do not provide an uncertainty on their measured position angle .",
    "gj 867ac has a @xmath20 of 455.8 @xmath0 2.7 mas / yr and a position angle of 99.9 degrees @xcite .",

    "table  [ table : motion ] summarizes previous parallax and proper motion measurements .",
    "the precise position measurements of gj 867bd spanning almost 10 years allow us to set mass limits on long period astrometric companions .",
    "this first requires an accurate assessment of the position uncertainties which we estimate empirically .",
    "this is done by characterizing the statistical uncertainty associated with each epoch s position measurement . to do this",
    ", we calculate the mean position error per night , which is the average standard deviation of position offsets , once parallactic and proper motions are removed .",
    "the mean position errors for all nights in ra and dec are 2.31 and 4.00 mas , respectively .",
    "the average residual deviation from the position predicted by the proper motion and parallax fit is calculated as the standard deviation of the nightly offsets , and in ra and dec are 1.37 and 3.83 mas , respectively .",
    "as we are measuring the predicted position with better precision than the average error , this may be an indicator that we are slighty over - estimating the mean position errors .    in order to set limits on the presence of companions orbiting gj 867bd with orbital periods between 2 to 10 years , we perform 100,000 monte carlo simulations with a range of orbital properties .",
    "orbital periods are restricted to 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 years , which are representative of our observational sampling and baseline .",
    "we estimate the mass of the primary to be 0.29 @xmath0 0.06 m@xmath21 based on the mass luminosity relation of @xcite .",
    "although we adopt this mass for all of our calculations , we note that this mass is based on the brightness of both gj 867b and gj 867d , as we are unable to deconvolve the binary and determine magnitudes and colors estimates for each component .",
    "the companion star gj 867d appears to contribute little light to the system ( see section 6.3 ) , and thus is unlikely to severly bias this estimate .",
    "this mass determinaton is slightly higher than the mass deterimed by the spectral type of gj 867b and the spectral type mass relations in @xcite of @xmath90.25 m@xmath21 , but consistent within the errors .",
    "we use the weighted distance measurement of the gj 867 system reported in section 3.3 .",
    "we allow the inclination to vary between 0 and 90 degrees and the eccentricity to vary between 0 and 0.9 .",
    "we allow the longitude of periastron , @xmath22 , and the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath23 , to vary from 0 to 180 degrees .",
    "this simulation suggests that 90@xmath5 of the time , we would have been able to detect , with 99.7@xmath5 ( or 3@xmath19 ) confidence , a companion with a mass of at least 18 m@xmath2 in a 2 year period , 11.5 m@xmath2 in a 4 year period , 9 m@xmath2 in a 6 year period , 7.5 m@xmath2 in a 8 year period and 7 m@xmath2 in a 10 year period .",

    "exposure times averaging @xmath9500 seconds each were set to obtain predicted signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) of @xmath9100 per exposure , and resulted in pair combined snrs ranging from 70 to 230 .",
    "along with observations of gj 867b , spectra of either the a7v star altair or the a1v star sirius were obtained to gain an initial estimate of the wavelength solution and the instrumental profile of cshell , since these spectra contain only telluric features .",
    "finally , 20 flats and darks with integration times of 10 or 20 seconds were taken each night .",
    "a brief overview highlighting the aspects of our spectral extraction and radial velocity ( rv ) fitting routine will be given here .",
    "for a full explanation of the data reduction technique , the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .    to prepare the 2d images for spectral extraction ,",
    "we first correct for flat fielding using dark - subtracted , median - combined flat field images .",
    "then , we remove sky emission , detector bias and dark current from the spectral images by subtracting each individual image from its pair image taken at a different nod position that immediately preceded or followed the image .",

    "then , we perform an optimal extraction of the spectra as implemented for nod subtracted pairs @xcite . unlike a standard extraction that simply sums over all the pixels to determine the 1d spectral profile , an optimal extraction sums pixels weighted by a variance image of the spectrum s spatial profile to determine the spectral profile .",
    "it is assumed that the spectral profile varies smoothly in the direction parallel to the dispersion . using a weighted image to determine the spectral profile gives the advantage that it minimizes the noisy contribution of the profile wings and eliminates the majority of the features on the spectral profile caused by cosmic rays or hot pixels .",

    "we optimize the circular fitted curves to give the lowest observed - minus - calculated ( o - c ) rv value using the amoeba minimization routine ( section 3.4 ) ; the results are shown in figure  [ fig : oc ] . the average ( o - c ) value for 1.795 days is 0.58 km s@xmath1 and is almost 5 times smaller than the ( o - c ) values for the periods of 2.841 days ( 2.88 km s@xmath1 ) and 1.541 days ( 3.00 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath31@xmath32 value for 1.795 days is 27 and 38 times smaller than the @xmath31@xmath32 values at 1.54 days and 2.841 days , respectively . from these comparisons ,",
    "we conclude that 1.795 days is the orbital period of the bd system .      to determine the orbital properties and the associated uncertainties of the orbit , we use the non - linear least squares fitting idl routine , mpfitfun.pro @xcite to model our data as a sinusoidal curve .",
    "the amplitude of the fitted curve is 21.4 @xmath0 0.5 km s@xmath1 , the velocity of the system is @xmath266.1 @xmath0 0.3 km s@xmath1 , and the epoch of conjunction is jd 2456160.5611 @xmath0 0.0268 .",
    "the peak with the most likely period is in a cluster of aliased peaks .",
    "to test whether the neighboring peaks represent reasonable orbital solutions , we again fit circular orbits to the top three aliasing peaks in closest proximity to the favorable period .",
    "the ( o - c ) values for these peaks range from 3.16 km s@xmath1 to 5.56 km s@xmath1 making these values significantly larger than the ( o - c ) values from the top three likely periods given by the periodogram fit .",
    "we conclude that neither of these periods represent good fits to our data and determine the uncertainty in the period from the fwhm of the central peak only , which yields a final best fit period and uncertainty of 1.795 @xmath0 0.017 days .",
    "the average difference between the ( o - c ) value for our best fit circular orbit of 0.58 km s@xmath1 is significantly higher than our average estimated error for this star based on the theoretical photon noise error and the instrumental error .",
    "this could be caused by a few possibilities .",
    "gj 867b could have a slightly elliptical orbit , and therefore the deviation we see from the observed compared to calculated value is real .",
    "alternatively , our estimated errors could be low , as we did not account for any intrinsic stellar error .",
    "gj 867b is a flare star with a nominally higher rotational velocity , which could be an indicator of a higher amount of intrinsic stellar jitter compared to other older field dwarfs .",
    "we caution that if the rv errors are too low , then the calculated errors on the orbital properties will be underestimated as well .      without a direct detection of gj 867d",
    ", we can only provide a lower mass limit based on the observed reflex motion of gj 867b using kepler s third law .",
    "we assume the orbit is circular and that the mass of the primary star is 0.29 @xmath0 0.06 m@xmath21 ( section 3.4 ) . under these assumptions",
    "the minimum mass of gj 867d is 61 @xmath0 7 m@xmath2 ( 0.059 @xmath0 0.007 m@xmath21 ) ; the uncertainty in the minimum mass is determined primarily by the uncertainty in the primary star s mass .",
    "gj 867d could be a brown dwarf .",
    "the spectral properties of gj 867ac and gj 867bd are summarized in table  [ table : mass ] .",
    "the brightness of gj 867bd supports the conclusion that gj 867d is very low mass .",
    "we compare the absolute magnitude in v to the ( v - k ) color of stars within 5 parsecs @xcite to gj 867 system ( see figure  [ fig : color ] ) .",
    "gj 867bd lies within the broad band making up the main sequence .",
    "therefore , there is no evidence that the companion contributes much light , consistent with its undetected spectral features .",
    "we report infrared spectroscopic observations obtained with the cshell spectrograph that reveal gj 867b to be a single - lined sb with an orbital period of 1.795 @xmath0 0.017 days ; the components are labeled b and d. assuming that gj 867b has a mass of 0.29 m@xmath38 , then gj 867d has a minimum mass ( @xmath39sin@xmath30 ) of 61 @xmath0 7 m@xmath2 ; it could be a brown dwarf .",
    "astrometric measurments spanning nearly 10 years are used to determine the trigonometric parallax and proper motion of gj 867bd .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of gj 867bd is consistent to within 1.1@xmath19 of the measured parallax of gj 867ac by _ hipparcos _ , confirming that the components of this @xmath40 pair are at similar distances .",
    "the measured proper motion amplitude of gj 867bd is 421.8 @xmath0 0.6 mas / yr , which is similar to but slightly smaller than the proper motion amplitude of gj 867ac ( 455.8 @xmath0 2.7 mas / yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; both stars are moving in the same direction to within 2 degrees . the difference ( -34.0 mas / yr )",
    "can easily be explained by orbital motion . adopting the minimum masses in table 5 and assuming the projected separation ( 216 au ) is the semi - major axis of the ac and bd pair",
    ", these components would be moving relative to one another at 1.8 km / s , corresponding to 43.2 mas / yr ( at 8.82 pc ) if in a face - on circular orbit . if in a somewhat inclinded orbit ( and if the components are more massive than the minimum masses used here ) , orbital motion could also explain the difference in the systemic velocities of gj 867bd , at @xmath41 km / s ( table 5 ) , and gj 867ac , at @xmath42 km / s @xcite ; we consider this apparent discrepancy less relevant , however , since the systemic velocity for gj 867ac is based on much coarser precision individual measurements ( 1.4 km / s ) and no formal uncertainty on the systemic velocity is provided .",
    "altogether , the similar proximity , distance , and space motion of these two high proper motion spectroscopic binaries establish them as very likely physically associated . as such",
    ", the 4 star system gj 867 becomes one of only four quadruple systems within 10 pc , and the closest quadruple system to the sun with an m dwarf primary .",
    "the discovery of this nearby quadruple system suggests that many more hierarchical low mass systems may exist nearby , but have not been found because of observational biases . as highlighted in the introduction ,",
    "the discovery and characterization of systems like this potentially offer a powerful tool for constraining the uncertain physics involved in binary and multiple star formation .",
    "we note that nearby systems like gj 867 are especially valuable , since these stars are close enough to have the spectroscopic orbits that can be spatially resolved interferometrically , allowing accurate masses of these systems to be determined .",
