    "the duality between quark and hadron descriptions of physical observables reveals a fascinating connection between the physics of quark confinement at low momentum scales and asymptotic freedom at large momenta . the striking manifestation of this duality in inclusive electron  nucleon scattering , first observed @xcite even before the advent of qcd , has motivated considerable effort in recent years to explore this phenomenon empirically , as well as to understand its origins theoretically ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from a practical perspective , the quantitative demonstration of the similarity between the structure functions measured in the nucleon resonance region and those in the deep inelastic continuum , at higher energies , opens up the intriguing possibility of using resonance region data to provide constraints on leading twist parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "attempts to utilize this connection have begun to be explored in recent global pdf fits @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where data on the unpolarized proton and deuteron @xmath3 structure functions at final state hadronic masses @xmath4 as low as @xmath5  gev have been used to extend determinations of pdfs to larger values of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the four - momentum squared and energy transferred to the proton , and @xmath9 is the proton mass .",
    "the availability of high - luminosity electron beams at jefferson lab has enabled high - precision measurements of various structure functions to be made over the past decade .",
    "these data have now firmly established the existence of duality in the proton @xmath3 and @xmath10 structure functions @xcite , and have provided tantalizing glimpses of its spin and flavor dependence in polarized @xcite and semi - inclusive scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "recently a new method @xcite was used to extract also the neutron @xmath3 structure function from inclusive proton and deuterium data in the nucleon resonance region @xcite , leading to the first quantitative determination of duality in the neutron s unpolarized structure functions .",
    "this observation suggested that duality is indeed a general feature of the resonance - scaling transition , and not due to accidental cancellations of quark charges @xcite .    because of",
    "the considerably larger data base of spin - averaged cross sections than polarization asymmetries , duality in the spin - dependent @xmath11 and @xmath12 structure functions has not yet been established to the same precision as for the unpolarized @xmath13 structure functions .",
    "an additional complication arises from the fact that for spin - dependent quantities one deals with differences of cross sections , which are not restricted to be positive .",
    "for example , in the @xmath2 resonance region the @xmath11 structure function of the proton , especially at low @xmath7 , is large and negative , while for the same @xmath14 and higher @xmath7 ( hence higher @xmath15 ) the structure function measured in the deep inelastic region is positive . such strong violation of duality would limit the use of resonance region data to constrain spin - dependent pdfs .",
    "furthermore , the neutron @xmath11 structure function changes sign as a function of @xmath14 , so can not be used to study ratios of resonance to deep inelastic structure functions or the relative size of duality violations .    on the other hand , duality violation may be less severe , even at low @xmath4 , in individual virtual photoabsorption helicity cross sections , defined by projecting the total spin of the @xmath16proton center of mass system along the photon direction .",
    "the helicity-1/2 projection , @xmath17 , represents the cross section for equal initial and excited hadronic state helicities , while the helicity-3/2 projection , @xmath18 , involves a change of the hadron helicities by two units .",
    "the sums and differences of the helicity cross sections , which are positive definite , correspond to the unpolarized and spin polarized structure functions , respectively .    at high @xmath7 and @xmath19 the helicity cross sections are proportional to the positive and negative helicity pdfs , @xmath20 , which describe the distribution of quarks with spin parallel or antiparallel to that of the nucleon . as with the cross sections ,",
    "the helicity pdfs are defined to be positive , and in a way represent more fundamental objects than the spin - averaged and spin - dependent pdfs .",
    "in fact , from perturbative qcd arguments one can make definite predictions for the behavior of the helicity pdfs in the limit @xmath21 , with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these predictions can be tested by studying the asymptotic @xmath14 dependence of helicity cross sections , which is difficult , however , because of the rapidly decreasing rates as @xmath21 . indeed ,",
    "since large @xmath14 generally corresponds to low @xmath4 , determining the large-@xmath14 behavior of inclusive cross sections at any finite @xmath7 will necessarily involve the resonance region .    in this paper",
    "we perform the first detailed study of quark - hadron duality in @xmath23 helicity cross sections , by combining previously measured sets of data on inclusive spin - averaged cross sections and double polarization asymmetries from jefferson lab and elsewhere .",
    "these data are used to quantify the degree of duality violation in each of the three prominent nucleon resonance regions , as well as over the entire range @xmath24  gev .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : defns ] we begin by defining the relevant cross sections and distributions used in this analysis . section  [ sec : data ] outlines the data analysis , describing the construction of the helicity cross sections form separate measurements of spin - averaged and spin - dependent structure functions .",
    "results of the analysis are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , for the @xmath14 dependence of helicity structure functions in several fixed-@xmath7 bins ranging from @xmath25 to 5  gev@xmath26 , as well as for integrals over the various resonance regions .",
    "comparison of the resonance data with parametrizations of data at higher energies then allow the first determination of the extent to which duality holds in helicity cross sections over this range .",
    "we also compare our findings with quark models that predict specific patterns of duality violation in structure functions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we draw some conclusions from this analysis and outline its broader implications for our understanding of quark - hadron duality as well as its practical exploitation .",
    "the differential cross section for the inclusive scattering of a longitudinally polarized electron with helicity @xmath27 from a proton with polarization @xmath28 along the virtual photon direction can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scattered electron energy , @xmath31 is the flux of virtual photons and @xmath32 is the transverse photon polarization @xcite .",
    "the photoabsorption cross sections for transversely polarized virtual photons are related to the helicity cross sections @xmath17 and @xmath18 by @xmath33 while the cross section for longitudinally polarized photons is given by the longitudinal structure function .",
    "the cross section @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) corresponds to the spins of the virtual photon and proton antialigned ( aligned ) in the center of mass system , so that the helicity of the excited nucleon state after absorbing a photon is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . whereas the @xmath17 cross section conserves the nucleon helicity , the @xmath18 changes the nucleon helicity by two units .    for convenience",
    "we define dimensionless helicity structure functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 in terms of the cross sections by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is associated with the choice of the virtual photon flux in the hand convention @xcite .",
    "the helicity structure functions can then be written in terms of the usual unpolarized @xmath41 and polarized @xmath42 structure functions as    [ eq : h ] @xmath43    each of which is a function of two variables , typically taken to be @xmath14 and @xmath7 . in the limit where both @xmath7 and @xmath19 are large , with @xmath14 finite ,",

    "the helicity structure functions become    @xmath48    so that in this limit @xmath36 is determined by the @xmath49 pdfs while @xmath37 is determined by the @xmath50 pdfs ( the antiquark distributions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are suppressed by additional powers of @xmath53 compared with the quark pdfs ) . in the @xmath21",

    "the experimental @xmath36 and @xmath37 helicity structure functions used in this analysis were obtained by combining measurements of @xmath58 ratios from jefferson lab experiment eg1b ( e91 - 023 ) in clas @xcite with the unpolarized @xmath41 structure function from the empirical christy - bosted ( cb ) global fit @xcite .",

    "the fit is constrained by high precision longitudinal and transverse separated cross section measurements from jefferson lab hall  c @xcite , unseparated hall  c measurements up to @xmath7 of 7.5  gev@xmath26 @xcite , and photoproduction data at @xmath61 .",
    "this fit was chosen because it covers a wide kinematic range and uses both transverse and longitudinal cross sections , which is particularly important for the @xmath41 estimation .",
    "due to the scarcity of @xmath12 measurements , especially in the resonance region , we use the phenomenological parametrization of ref .",

    "note that since @xmath36 and @xmath37 are different combinations of the same structure functions ( differing only in relative sign , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) ) , the resulting absolute uncertainties are the same for the two cross sections . however , since @xmath63 the relative uncertainties will be different , with that on @xmath37 much greater than on @xmath36 .",

    "[ fig : rel ] .",
    "the helicity-3/2 structure function is dominated in the resonance region by the @xmath2 , with suppressed contributions in all other channels .",

    "the prediction of vanishing @xmath37 for the nucleon elastic contribution reflects the dominance of magnetic coupling assumed in the model @xcite , which is expected to be a better approximation at high @xmath7 .",

    "various scenarios for su(6 ) symmetry breaking , consistent with quark - hadron duality , were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to specific predictions for structure function ratios in the @xmath21 limit .",
    "the general trends of the duality violations persist even in the more realistic symmetry breaking scenarios , so that the deviations from unity in fig .",
    "[ fig : rel ] can be understood , at least qualitatively , in terms of a microscopic quark - level description .",
    "note also that the quark model predictions relate to the resonant components of the data _ only _ ; the presence of the nonresonant background washes out these predictions somewhat , especially at larger @xmath7 , and its remarkable that the general trends of the duality violations in the various resonance regions nevertheless remain .",
    "in this work we have performed the first detailed analysis of quark - hadron duality in individual @xmath23 helicity cross sections , utilizing recent data on inclusive unpolarized and polarized structure functions from jefferson lab . unlike spin - dependent structure functions which can change sign as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath7 , the helicity cross sections are by definition constrained to be positive definite .",
    "this reduces the dramatic violations of duality seen for example in the proton @xmath11 structure function in the @xmath2 resonance region , where the negative resonance contribution at low @xmath7 makes way for a positive structure function in deep inelastic kinematics at large @xmath7 .",
    "the data on the polarized and unpolarized structure functions are used to quantify the degree of duality violation in the helicity structure functions in each of the three prominent nucleon resonance regions , as well as over the entire range @xmath24  gev .",
    "we find that duality is realized more clearly for helicity-1/2 structure function @xmath36 than for the helicity-3/2 function @xmath37 , with the duality violating corrections in the latter positive in the first resonance region and negative in the second resonance region .",

    "the duality violating corrections are @xmath0 ( and negative ) for @xmath36 and @xmath1 ( and positive ) for @xmath37 at @xmath80  gev@xmath26 , which is rather smaller than the corresponding duality violation found in the spin - dependent @xmath11 structure function .",

    "this lends support to recent efforts to broaden the kinematic coverage in global fits of unpolarized pdfs @xcite by lowering the @xmath7 and @xmath19 cuts , and to extending these efforts to the polarized sector .",
    "moreover , it raises the interesting possibility of performing global fits of helicity pdfs @xmath49 and @xmath50 directly , rather than reconstructing these from separate unpolarized and polarized pdf analyses ; such an enterprise would demand a consistent analysis of combined cross section and polarization asymmetry data along the lines presented in this work .",
