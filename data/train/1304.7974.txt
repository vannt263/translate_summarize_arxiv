    "there is considerable interest in the spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons and of charmonium both theoretically and experimentally .    on the theory side",
    "first principles calculations are usually lattice qcd computations ( for recent work cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) . in the last couple of years",
    "a lot of progress has been made , allowing the determination of hadron masses like the aforementioned mesons with rather high precision .",
    "for example 2 + 1 or even 2 + 1 + 1 flavors of dynamical quark are often used as well as small lattice spacings and improved discretizations , to keep discretization errors ( in particular those , associated with the heavy charm quarks ) under control .",
    "some groups have even started to determine the resonance parameters of certain mesons from the spectrum of two - particle scattering states in finite spatial volumes ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .    experimentally a large number of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and charmonium states has been measured and additional and/or more precise results are expected in the near future both from existing facilities and facilities currently under construction , like the panda experiment at fair .",
    "even though these experimental results have been extremely helpful , to improve our understanding of qcd , they also brought up new and yet unanswered questions .",
    "for example the positive parity mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 are unexpectedly light , which is at the moment not satisfactorily understood and also quite often not reproduced by lattice qcd computations or model calculations .",
    "moreover , performing a precise computation of certain meson masses is often the first step for many lattice projects not primarily concerned with spectroscopy . as an example one could mention the semileptonic decay of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons into positive parity @xmath0 mesons @xcite , whose masses and operator contents are an essential ingredient for any corresponding lattice computation .",
    "this is a status report about an ongoing lattice qcd project concerned with the computation of the spectrum of mesons with at least one charm valence quark .",
    "we present preliminary results for @xmath0 mesons , for @xmath1 mesons and for charmonium states with total angular momentum @xmath6 and parity @xmath7 .",
    "parts of this work have already been published @xcite .",
    "we use gauge link configurations with 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical quark flavors generated by the european twisted mass collaboration ( etmc ) @xcite . until now we have considered two ensembles ( around 600 gauge link configurations per ensemble ) with ( unphysically heavy ) values for the light @xmath8 quark mass corresponding to @xmath9 ( lattice sizes @xmath10 ) .",
    "our results are obtained at a single lattice spacing @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , a continuum extrapolation has not yet been performed .",
    "meson masses are determined by computing and studying temporal correlation matrices of suitably chosen meson creation operators @xmath12 . at the moment we exclusively consider quark antiquark operators .",
    "the quark and the antiquark are combined in spin space via @xmath13 matrices and in color and position space via gauge links ( discretized covariant derivatives ) such that the corresponding trial states @xmath14 ( @xmath15 denotes the vacuum ) are gauge invariant and have defined total angular momentum and parity . moreover ,",
    "ape and gaussian smearing is used , to optimize the overlap of the trial states @xmath14 to the low lying mesonic states of interest .",
    "more details regarding the construction of meson creation operators in twisted mass lattice qcd can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "we plan to discuss these operators , their structure and their quantum numbers in detail in an upcoming publication . for the computation of the corresponding correlation matrices @xmath16",
    "we resort to the one - end trick ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "meson masses are then determined from plateaux values of corresponding effective masses , which we obtain by solving generalized eigenvalue problems ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "disconnected diagrams appearing in charmonium correlators are currently neglected .",
    "for both the valence strange and charm quarks we use degenerate twisted mass doublets , i.e.  a different discretization as for the corresponding sea quarks .",
    "we do this , to avoid mixing of strange and charm quarks , which inevitably takes place in a unitary setup , and which is particularly problematic for hadrons containing charm quarks @xcite .",
    "the degenerate valence doublets allow two realizations for strange as well as for charm quarks , either with a twisted mass term @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "for a quark antiquark meson creation operator the sign combinations @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the quark @xmath21 and the antiquark @xmath22 are related by symmetry , i.e.  the corresponding correlators are identical .",
    "these correlators differ , however , from their counterparts with sign combinations @xmath23 and @xmath24 , due to different discretization errors . in section  [ sec001 ]",
    "we will show for each computed meson mass both the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 result .",
    "the differences are @xmath27 due to automatic @xmath28 improvement inherent to the twisted mass formulation .",
    "these mass differences give a first impression regarding the magnitude of discretization errors at our currently used lattice spacing .",
    "using @xmath25 correlators we have tuned the bare valence strange and charm quark masses @xmath29 and @xmath30 to reproduce the physical values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , quantities , which strongly depend on @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but which are essentially independent of the light @xmath8 quark mass .",
    "in fig .  [ fig001 ] we present our results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson spectrum . for every state",
    "we show five data points : + _ red circles and crosses _ : + lattice results at @xmath33 , twisted mass sign combinations + @xmath25 and @xmath34 , respectively . + _ blue stars and boxes _ : + lattice results at @xmath35 , twisted mass sign combinations + @xmath25 and @xmath34 , respectively . + _ gray triangles _ :",
    "+ experimental result from the pdg @xcite .",
    "+ the differences between sign combinations @xmath25 and + @xmath34 , which are @xmath36 , indicate the magnitude of discretization errors at our currently used lattice spacing @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson spectrum.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] + the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson spectrum.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    while for the negative parity states lattice and experimental results agree rather well , there is a clear discrepancy in particular for the positive parity @xmath1 states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "similar findings have been reported in other lattice studies , e.g.  @xcite , and in phenomenological model calculations , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy might be an indication that these states are not predominantly @xmath37 states , but e.g.  rather four quark states of molecular or tetraquark type .",
    "we plan to investigate this possibility within our setup in the near future .",
    "the necessary techniques have already been developed and recently been applied to light scalar mesons @xcite .",
    "another challenging , but important task is the separation of the two @xmath38 states , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . in the limit of a static charm quark one of these states",
    "has light cloud angular momentum @xmath41 , while the other has @xmath42 . to assign corresponding approximative @xmath43 quantum numbers , when using charm quarks of finite mass , is e.g.  important , when studying the decay of a @xmath4 or @xmath5 meson to one of the positive parity @xmath44 mesons ( which include the mentioned @xmath45 and @xmath46 states ) in a fully dynamical setup ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite for a recent lattice computation in the static limit ) .",
    "the correct identification of @xmath41 and @xmath42 states can be achieved by studying the eigenvectors obtained during the analysis of correlation matrices ; the largest eigenvector components point out the dominating operators , which , after a clebsch - gordan decomposition into light and heavy angular momentum contributions , can be classified according to @xmath41 or @xmath42 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig002 ] we present our results for the charmonium spectrum . because of the two rather heavy valence quarks , we expect considerably larger discretization errors as for the corresponding @xmath0 or @xmath1 meson states .",
    "the differences between lattice and experimental results are most prominent for the negative parity charmonium states ( around @xmath47 ) .",
    "we plan to explore in one of our next steps , whether discretization errors account for these differences by performing similar computations on ensembles with finer lattice spacings and by studying the continuum limit .    the charmonium spectrum.,width=321 ]",
