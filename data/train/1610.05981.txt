    "at the end of the last century , structures grown or synthesized on a nanoscale have revealed new insights and potential applications which have profoundly altered our vision of the technology .",

    "closer to the commercial level , the creation and performance analysis of stacked photovoltaic - thermoelectric modules have been reported  @xcite . incidentally",

    "temperatures of out - of - equilibrium populations of electrons and holes could be traced back from the negf - based approach used in this paper . in their general forms ,",
    "these expressions allow us to formulate the spectral entropy current flowing in the three reservoirs of the nanodevice , namely the two electronic reservoirs , and the photon bath .",
    "moreover , we recast the net entropy flow in the difference between the efficiency of the reversible photovoltaic - thermoelectric hybrid , and the effective device efficiency .",
    "considering quantum dot based hybrid systems , we showed from analytics that entropy production is always positive when a single photon energy is taken for the spontaneous emission process .",
    "but , we found from numerics that the rate of entropy production can be negative when more traditional models are followed , in particular when the emission contribution is integrated over all the photon energies of the broadened spectrum .",
    "this work brings to light this striking paradox and opens avenues to explore entropy production at the nanoscale in interacting systems , which reiterates current fundamental questions underlying the second law of thermodynamics in quantum systems .",

    "<S> we derive the expressions of photon energy and particle currents inside an open nanosystem interacting with light using non - equilibrium green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> the model allows different temperatures for the electron reservoirs , which basically defines a photovoltaic - thermoelectric hybrid . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to these expressions , we formulate the steady - state entropy production rate to assess the efficiency of reversible photovoltaic - thermoelectric nanodevices . </S>",
    "<S> next , quantum dot based nanojunctions are closely examined . </S>",
    "<S> we show that entropy production is always positive when one considers spontaneous emission of photons with a specific energy , while in general the emission spectrum is broadened , notably for strong coupling to reservoirs . in this latter case , when the emission is integrated over all the energies of the spectrum , we find that entropy production can reach negative values . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides matter to question the second law of thermodynamics for interacting nanosystems beyond the assumption of weak coupling . </S>"
