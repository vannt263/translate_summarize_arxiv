    "ngc 6383 ( @xmath1 = 17@xmath2314 , @xmath3 = @xmath43232 ) is a relatively small ( 10 arcmin radius , hagen 1970 ) very young open cluster , centered around the bright spectroscopic binary hd 159176 ( o7 v + o7 v , @xmath5 = 3.366767 days ; stickland et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the weak h@xmath0 emission nebula stromlo 67 ( gum 1955 ) , also known as s11 ( sharpless 1953 ) or rcw 132 ( rodgers et al .",

    "together with ngc 6530 and ngc 6531 , ngc 6383 belongs to the sgr ob1 association .",
    "a photoelectric study by eggen ( 1961 ) showed that the stars in ngc 6383 later than a0 lie above the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) and might therefore still be contracting .",
    "a photographic study of stars in a larger area around the cluster by th ( 1965 ) confirmed eggen s results , but failed to find weak h@xmath0 emission line stars of the type found in other very young open clusters , such as ngc 2264 , ngc 6530 and ngc 6611 .",
    "fitzgerald et al . ( 1978 ) studied stars in the central core ( 1.25 arcmin radius ) of ngc 6383 using photoelectric photometry and derived an average colour excess @xmath6 = @xmath7 , a cluster distance @xmath8 of @xmath9 kpc and a cluster age of @xmath10 million years .",
    "luiken - miller ( 1982 ) derived a similar numbers for the @xmath6 : @xmath11 .",
    "however , her cluster distance of @xmath12 kpc deviates considerably from the value by fitzgerald et al .",
    "furthermore , luiken - miller found a considerable spread in the ages of the stars in ngc 6383 , with an average age of 2.2 million years .",

    "two additional stars ( numbers 18 , 20 and possibly 24 ) show a modest amount of infrared excess .",
    "this probably indicates the presence of circumstellar dust , heated up by the central star , in these systems . since star number 4 is the only one of our programme stars which also shows h@xmath0 in emission ( see fig .  1 )",

    "3 we notice that all stars in ngc 6383 fall below both stellar birthlines , and therefore confirm the palla & stahler models .",
    "furthermore , the stars we classified spectroscopically with luminosity classes iii or iv in table  3 all seem to be located to the right of the main - sequence , and therefore are probably true pre - main sequence stars",
    ". however , no strong correlation between position in the hr diagram and the presence of a near - infrared excess seems to be present within our sample .",
    "the spectral and extinction properties of 14 pre - main sequence star candidates in the central part of the very young open cluster ngc 6383 were investigated . from fitting of kurucz ( 1991 ) models to their spectral energy distributions , it was concluded that none of these stars shows any evidence for anomalous circumstellar extinction .",
    "however , six out of out 14 programme stars do show an infrared excess , indicative of the presence of circumstellar dust , heated up by the central star .",
    "no correlation between the infrared excess and the position in the cluster s hr diagram could be found .",
    "one programme star ( number 4 ) , has a large infrared excess , reminiscent of the one displayed by many herbig ae / be stars .",
    "furthermore , it shows h@xmath0 in emission and shows some indications for the presence of circumstellar gas in its spectrum .",
    "therefore it was concluded that this star can be considered as a new herbig ae star candidate .",
    "a literature search was done for photometric data for this star , but the available data do not show any indications for photometric variability , such as displayed by many herbig ae stars .",
