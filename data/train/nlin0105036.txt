    "a major goal in the study of temporal chaos in spatially extended systems @xcite ( spatiotemporal chaos or stc ) is to find a statistical description of the behavior of a particular dynamical system in the limit of large length and long time scales .",
    "this is analogous to a hydrodynamic description of a system of microscopic particles satisfying classical mechanics .",
    "some progress has been made in this regard in recent years , including constructing a long wavelength , long time theory of the kuramoto - sivashinsky ( ks ) equation @xcite . in this reference",
    ", the authors obtained an effective stochastic equation which belongs to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) university class in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "this was obtained by incorporating the chaotic dynamics of the small ks system in a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the basic premise of their approach is that the spatiotemporal chaos of a large system can be understood in terms of the chaos observed in mutually coupled , small systems .",
    "two other recent studies @xcite of the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation used a wavelet decomposition to characterize its spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "the first investigation led to results similar to those of reference @xcite , suggesting a statistical description of a group of identical short length subsystems , slowly driven via interactions with the larger scales .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite it was shown that an effective equation could be obtained and consistently approximated by a forced burgers equation , for scales far from the cutoff between small and large wavelengths .",
    "this work was extended in @xcite where the authors found that projecting onto a spline wavelet basis enabled a good separation of length scales , with each having its own characteristic dynamics . at large scales they found essentially slow gaussian dynamics , which can be understood in terms of local events .",
    "the results are also consistent with the picture of weakly interacting small subsystems and so - called `` extensive chaos '' ( in which the lyapunov dimension is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the linear system size and @xmath2 the dimension of space ) .",
    "the authors also discussed various correlation lengths and demonstrated the existence of a spatial interaction length , which provides a limit on how much one may limit spatial interactions without changing the dynamics significantly ( and hence limits how small a system one can use ) .",
    "motivated by the success of the wavelet decomposition of the ks model , we have undertaken such a decomposition for another one dimensional model , the so - called nikolaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "this model was originally proposed to describe the propagation of longitudinal seismic waves .",
    "it was subsequently shown to exhibit a direct transition from a spatially uniform , stationary state to a spatiotemporally chaotic state as a control parameter was varied @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal chaotic behavior of this system ( which has been named as soft mode turbulence or smt ) is different from that of the ks equation as a result of the existence of an additional continuous symmetry in the model ( beyond the conventional symmetries of space and time translation invariance ) .",
    "this model is particularly interesting in that there are two control parameters , @xmath3 and the system size @xmath1 , such that one can study the transition to chaos as a function of @xmath3 in terms of power law behavior , scaling , etc . in this sense",
    "it is a richer model than the ks equation and many results have been obtained for it , including a calculation of the lyapunov exponents , lyapunov dimension and kolmogorov - sinai entropy for several values of @xmath3 in the limit of large @xmath1 such that extensive chaos holds @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the distribution function for the order parameter is gaussian for large wavelengths and large times . in this paper",
    "we carry out a wavelet decomposition similar to that in reference @xcite , using a daubechies basis .",
    "we find that the most energetic modes have a gaussian distribution for this choice of basis .",
    "we also calculate the lyapunov spectrum and find that one can remove a certain set of the modes without altering this spectrum , suggesting that in this sense one can obtain a more minimal description of spatiotemporal chaos for this model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we define the model and the wavelet decomposition scheme . in section",
    "iii we present the main results of our analysis .",
    "this includes a calculation of the energy distribution ( power spectrum ) and the probability density functions for the wavelet coefficients .",
    "it also includes a calculation of the effects on the lyapunov spectrum resulting from removing various modes from the dynamics . in section",
    "iv we present briefly the conclusions of this work .",
    "the nikolaevskii model is defined by the partial differential equation @xmath4v + v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}= 0 \\label{niko}\\ ] ] with @xmath5 and periodic boundary conditions , where @xmath3 and @xmath1 are two control parameters for the model . in the present paper",
    "we study the model for @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; these values are large enough to see well developed stc@xcite .",
    "+ the general form of a discrete wavelet decomposition for a field @xmath8 can be written as @xmath9 where the set @xmath10 form an orthogonal basis in the sense that @xmath11 the indices @xmath12 are integers which we specify below .",
    "the function @xmath13 is called the wavelet function ( or `` mother '' function ) and the wavelet coefficients can be obtained as @xmath14 one obtains equations of motion for the wavelet coefficients by substituting eq.([decom ] ) into eq.([niko ] ) .",
    "those equations of motion can then be numerically solved in order to obtain the time evolution of the wavelet coefficients and , hence , information about the chaotic behavior of the model .",
    "alternatively , one can solve directly eq.([niko ] ) and use eq.([coef ] ) to obtain the wavelet coefficients .",
    "this latter approach is the one we follow in this paper : at the required times we decompose the resulting solution for @xmath8 in terms of the daub4 orthogonal basis set .",
    "the daub4 is the simplest of a wavelet family named daub@xmath15 constructed by daubechies @xcite where @xmath15 ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "based on this wavelet family a very effective algorithm has been developed @xcite .",
    "thus by this method we obtain the time dependence of the wavelet coefficients @xmath18 .",
    "the nikolaevskii equation ( [ niko ] ) is integrated numerically using a version of the pseudo - spectral method combined with a fourth - order predictor - corrector integrator .",
    "( the details of this method will be given elsewhere ) .",
    "we use a mesh size @xmath19 and a time step @xmath20 in the numerical scheme .",
    "the length @xmath1 of the system is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total number of points of the system .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is an integer which represents the largest level of the wavelet ) in order to apply daub4 in an efficient pyramidal scheme . in our case",
    "we usually choose @xmath25 so @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the total integration time in our simulation goes from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ( in the dimensionless units of equation ( [ niko ] ) ) , depending on which quantity we calculate .",
    "usually , once we have reached the chaotic state , we perform time averages of the quantities of interest .",
    "the wavelet decomposition using daub4 is carried out in a pyramidal scheme such that at level @xmath30 there is a total of @xmath31 coefficients : @xmath18 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , except for the coarsest level @xmath34 where there are @xmath35 coefficients , namely @xmath36 and @xmath37 , instead of just one . to be more precise in the notation",
    ", we define the wavelet contribution at level @xmath30 as @xmath38 such that the field is a sum of all its wavelet contributions , @xmath39 .",
    "notice that as the wavelet level becomes coarser , i.e reducing @xmath30 by one , the number of wavelet coefficients contributing to @xmath40 is therefore reduced by a factor of two and that the total number of wavelet coefficients @xmath18 equals the number of points in the system , @xmath23 .",
    "in the language of signal processing , the total energy of a signal field is a conserved quantity . for our case",
    ", the energy for the chaotic field @xmath8 can be defined as @xmath41 and it can be written as the sum of the energies at each wavelet level , @xmath42 with @xmath43 . fig .",
    "( 1a ) shows the energy distribution per wavelet level for the nikolaevskii model , averaged over time .",
    "one sees that the energy of the field is mainly concentrated at wavelet level @xmath44 . as a comparison",
    ", we also show the structure factor @xmath45 , which can be thought of as the energy distribution in fourier space , in fig .",
    "it is easy to show for this model @xcite that the unstable modes ( within linear stability analysis ) in fourier space are located between @xmath46 , with the most unstable mode at @xmath47 , consistent with the results shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in our case",
    "with @xmath6 it is @xmath48 and @xmath49 , so with @xmath27 , the most energetic mode should be at @xmath50 and the smallest and largest unstable modes are at @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively",
    ". therefore there should be about @xmath17 complex or @xmath53 real unstable or marginal modes concentrated in the neighborhood of the @xmath54th real mode .",
    "notice that wavelet levels @xmath55 contain a total of @xmath56 modes ( corresponding to @xmath56 wavelet coefficients ) .",
    "it is easy to understand , therefore , that the energy peak is located at wavelet level @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one compares figures ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) , we can also see that for small q there is no similarity between the two energy distributions , implying that for small @xmath57 the overlap between different wavelet levels is relatively strong .",
    "figure 2 shows the temporal behavior of some wavelet coeffients @xmath18 . at each level",
    "@xmath30 we show the intermediate wavelet coefficient with @xmath58 .",
    "notice that , from the very early times , there is a chaotic behavior in the temporal evolution . in fig .",
    "3 we show the probability density    functions ( pdfs ) for the wavelet coefficients from level @xmath59 to @xmath60 , averaged over time .",
    "namely , for fixed j we sum over all k for the @xmath61 coefficients to obtain a mean value ; we repeat this over all times sampled and plot these mean values to obtain the pdf .",
    "the pdfs for @xmath34 and @xmath62 are not shown here , since they are just dirac - delta functions with spikes at zero .",
    "the delta function - like behavior at the largest wavelet level @xmath62 simply means that there is a strong dissipation at large wavenumbers in the fourier spectrum ( cf wittenberg and holmes @xcite ) .",
    "3 we can already see a similar behavior developing at the level @xmath60 . ) the spike at @xmath34 , however , only implies that the coarsest part is not suitable for describing the field and its two components compete with each other everywhere to yield a zero average value for the amplitude .",
    "we have tried to fit these pdfs to a gaussian distribution . in fig .",
    "3 we see that for @xmath63 the pdfs are essentially gaussian .",
    "( we do not think the small deviations from gaussian are statistically significant . )",
    "the wavelet decomposition of the stc in this model allows us to examine the chaotic behavior of the system at different spatial scales . in general , as can be seen somewhat in fig .",
    "1a ) , the large @xmath30 levels correspond to large wavenumbers or small spatial scales and the small @xmath30 levels correspond to small wavenumbers or large spatial scales . in this section",
    "we try to confirm this in more detail by showing the structure factors which result from removing various wavelet levels .    in fig.(4a - f )",
    "we show the structure factor for some of these `` reduced level '' systems , with the full structure factor for the nikolaevskii model shown for comparison",
    "( 4a ) shows the result of removing wavelet level @xmath62 , for which the new structure factor is almost identical with the exact one .",
    "this shows that removing the smallest spatial scale in the wavelets ( or , equivalently , the shortest wavelengths ) leaves the system invariant .",
    "( 4b ) shows the result of removing levels @xmath60 and @xmath62 . in this case",
    ", there is a small difference between the two structure factors for large wavenumbers , indicating that the large @xmath30 levels of the wavelets only contribute to the short - wavelength dynamics ( i.e. the fast dissipation ) of the model .",
    "( 4c ) shows the result of removing levels @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this case",
    "there is a significant difference between the two structure factors near the peak .",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath66 is the second most energetic level in the model .",
    "( 4d ) shows the results of removing levels @xmath67 and @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting structure factors shows that these levels are responsible for the small peak in the structure factor near wavenumber @xmath68 .",
    "( 4e ) shows the role of the most energetic levels in the model , i.e. @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we see that these levels are responsible for the dominant part of the structure factor .",
    "furthermore , we also see that without level @xmath71 , the small peak near @xmath68 becomes even smaller in comparison with fig.(4d ) .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "( 4f ) shows the result of removing all levels with @xmath72 .",
    "as one would expect , one only has the peak near small @xmath57 . if one considers all of the above results , one obtains a clear picture of the scale localization involved in the wavelet decomposition .",
    "we end this section with a discussion of the relationship between wavelet decomposition and the renormalization group transformation .",
    "it is clear that removing the large-@xmath30 wavelet levels is a procedure that essentially removes the short - wavelength part of the structure factor in fourier space . in this sense",
    "it is like a renormalization group transformation in which one integrates out the short wavelength degrees of freedom to obtain a renormalized description of a system .",
    "the particular daub4 algorithm we use here is a kind of decimation transformation in that at every step removing a wavelet of the largest remaining level means that one has only half as many spatial points as before the removal to describe the ( chaotic ) field .",
    "the other set of values of the field is `` filtered out '' , with the value of the field at a given new ( remaining ) space point being a kind of average of the field at four of the neighboring points of the original set .",
    "other types of wavelet decompositions correspond to different kinds of transformations .",
    "we conclude by examining the effect of removing wavelet levels on the lyapunov spectrum of the system .",
    "this provides us with the most detailed understanding of the contribution of various levels to the chaotic dynamics of the system . fig .",
    "( 5a ) shows the lyapunov spectrum obtained after removing the @xmath62 level , while fig .",
    "( 5b ) shows the lyapunov spectrum obtained after removing @xmath60 and @xmath62 .",
    "the lyapunov spectrum for the nikolaevskii model is also shown for comparison . in table 1",
    "we show the lyapunov dimension @xmath73 and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xmath74 for these different cases .",
    "it seems that to a very good approximation the chaotic behavior of the system does not depend on the @xmath62 level .",
    "thus a simplified statistical description of the nikolaevskii equation can be obtained by excluding the @xmath62 level , without altering the chaotic dynamics for the system .",
    "however , it is also clear from inspection of table 1 that removing any additional levels significantly alters the behavior .",
    "thus all these levels play an important role in the spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics of the system .",
    "we have shown that the dynamics of the one dimensional nikolaevskii equation in the spatiotemporally chaotic regime may be understood in terms of localized dynamics in both space and scale ( wavenumber ) .",
    "specifically , a projection onto a particular daubechies basis ( daub4 ) yields a good separation of scales , as shown by an examination of the contribution of different wavelet levels to the power spectrum . at most scales , including the most energetic ones , we find essentially gaussian dynamics .",
    "perhaps most importantly , we also found that removal of certain wavelet modes can be made without altering the chaotic dynamics of the system as described by the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "many different length scales have been proposed for the description of spatiotemporal chaos @xcite .",
    "these include the usual correlation length @xmath75 for the ( two point ) order parameter and the dimension correlation length @xmath76 , obtained from the lyapunov dimension d(l ) as @xmath77 .",
    "here @xmath2 denotes the space dimensionality and @xmath1 the linear dimension of the system .",
    "we have studied both of these lengths as a function of the control parameter @xmath3 for this model .",
    "the results of these calculations , as well as for other quantities characterizing the spatiotemporal chaos will be presented elsewhere @xcite . since it is difficult to calculate the lyapunov dimension for high - dimensional systems , zoldi and greenside",
    "have proposed using a karhunen - loeve dimension @xmath78 , defined by the number of eigenmodes in a proper orthogonal decomposition necessary to capture a given fraction @xmath79 of the total energy . from this dimension",
    "one can define a karhunen - loeve correlation length @xmath80 .",
    "however , for a translationally invariant system , such as the nikolaevskii equation with periodic boundary conditions , the karhunen - loeve eigenmodes are fourier modes .",
    "thus the karhunen - loeve dimension length for any @xmath79 can be computed directly from the power spectrum @xmath45 and thus contains no more dynamical information than @xmath75 . as wittenberg and",
    "holmes have pointed out @xcite all these lengths ( with the possible exception of the dimension correlation length @xmath76 ) are measures only of spatial disorder and thus yield no information about the temporally chaotic dynamics responsible for the disorder . as a consequence , wittenberg and holmes introduced another length scale , a so - called dynamical interaction length .",
    "this is a length scale @xmath81 such that if one deletes interactions for length scales greater than @xmath81 in the wavelet galerkin projection of the model equation of interest , one alters the chaotic dynamics of the model ( i.e. changes the lyapunov spectrum ) .",
    "although this is in principle a very interesting length scale to study , it involves a numerical calculation which for our model is computationally expensive and beyond our current resources . as a consequence",
    ", we leave this important issue for future investigation .",
    "finally , as mentioned in the introduction , wittenberg and holmes @xcite performed a wavelet decomposition of the kuramoto - sivashinsky model , using an orthogonal spline basis .",
    "they found that the probability distribution functions for the most energetic modes were non - gaussian .",
    "this differs from our results for the nikolaevskii model , in which the distribution functions for the most energetic modes are gaussian ( to a very good approximation and excluding the peak near zero ) . to see whether this difference is significant or simply results from a different choice of basis functions in the two studies",
    ", we have calculated the pdfs for the ks model using the daub4 basis .",
    "we found that with this choice of basis the pdfs for the most energetic modes are in fact gaussian .",
    "we find non - gaussian behavior only at the small-@xmath30 levels .",
    "thus it would seem that any non - gaussian behavior of the wavelet coefficients depends on the basis chosen for the wavelet decomposition .",
