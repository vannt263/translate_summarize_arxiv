    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) radiate the bulk of their large luminosities ( @xmath1 ) as infrared dust emission .",
    "large infrared luminosities mean that : ( 1 ) luminous energy sources are present , but are hidden behind dust ; ( 2 ) energetic radiation from the hidden energy sources is absorbed by the surrounding dust ; and ( 3 ) the heated dust grains re - emit this energy as infrared thermal radiation . to understand the nature of lirgs , it is essential to unveil the hidden energy sources ; namely , to distinguish whether starbursts (= nuclear fusion inside stars ) are dominant , or active galactic nuclei ( agns ; active mass accretion onto a central compact supermassive black hole [ smbh ] with @xmath210@xmath3m@xmath4 ) are also energetically important .",
    "unlike agns surrounded by toroidally shaped dust , which are classified optically as seyferts @xcite , concentrated molecular gas and dust in lirg nuclei @xcite can easily _",
    "(= obscure in virtually all directions ) the putative compact agns , making agn signatures very difficult to detect optically . however , it is crucial to understand the energetic role of such optically elusive _ buried _ agns in lirg nuclei .",
    "a starburst ( nuclear fusion ) and buried agn ( mass accretion onto a smbh ) have very different energy generation mechanisms .",
    "specifically , while uv emission is predominant in a starburst , an agn emits strong x - ray emission in addition to uv . additionally , in a normal starburst , the stellar energy sources and dust are spatially well mixed , so energy sources are spatially extended .",
    "since the energy generation efficiency of the nuclear fusion reaction is only @xmath50.5% of mc@xmath6 ( m is the mass of material used in the nuclear fusion reaction ) , the emission surface brightness of a starburst is modest and has both observational @xcite and theoretical @xcite upper limits ( @xmath510@xmath7l@xmath4 kpc@xmath8 ) . on the other hand , in an agn , the mass accreting smbh is spatially very compact , and thus more centrally concentrated than the surrounding gas and dust . the high energy generation efficiency of an agn ( 642% of mc@xmath6 ; m is the mass of accreting material ; thorne 1974 ) can generate large luminosities from a very compact region , producing a very high emission surface brightness @xcite .",
    "these differences between an agn and a starburst could create differences in the properties of the surrounding molecular gas and dust that may be distinguishable based on observations at wavelengths of low dust extinction .",
    "molecular gas emission lines in the millimeter wavelength range can be used effectively to investigate the hidden energy sources of lirg nuclei .",
    "first , dust extinction is very small .",
    "second , theoretical calculations predict that x - ray- and uv - emitting energy sources show different behaviors of molecular line emission due to different chemical reactions @xcite . finally , mid - infrared 1020 @xmath9 m emission is strong in an agn because of hot dust thermal emission heated by the high surface brightness energy source of an agn",
    ". the strong mid - infrared emission could selectively enhance particular molecular line emission through an infrared radiative pumping mechanism @xcite . in this paper , we focus on hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) lines , because an agn could enhance hcn(10 ) emission through an increased hcn abundance @xcite and/or infrared radiative pumping @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite found observationally that hcn(10 ) emission is stronger , relative to hco@xmath0(10 ) , in agn - dominated nuclei than in starburst galaxies , demonstrating the potential of this hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) based method for the purpose of distinguishing between an agn and a starburst .",
    "this method may be effective even for a compton thick ( n@xmath10 @xmath2 10@xmath11 cm@xmath8 ) buried agn , the detection of which is very difficult with direct x - ray observations .",
    "hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) observations of a large number of lirgs have been made , using single - dish radio telescopes @xcite .",
    "however , the beam sizes of these observations are so large ( @xmath225 arcsec ) that severe contamination from spatially - extended star - forming emission is unavoidable , possibly hampering the detection of the agn signatures of lirg nuclei , where putative agns are expected to be present .",
    "furthermore , lirgs often show multiple - nucleus morphologies with small separations ( @xmath1310 arcsec ) , for which spatially - resolved study is not possible with single - dish radio telescopes .",
    "finally , the hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) data were collected at different times under different weather conditions , possibly increasing uncertainty regarding their relative strengths due to the ambiguity of inter - calibration of data .    to overcome these issues , we performed millimeter _ interferometric , spatially - resolved , simultaneous _ hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) observations of lirgs , using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) @xcite . in our study ,",
    "only nuclear hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) emission was extracted to investigate their ratios in brightness temperature ( @xmath14 flux @xmath15 @xmath16 ) .",
    "the sample contained mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; l@xmath17 @xmath2 10@xmath18l@xmath4 ; sanders et al .",
    "1988a ) showing luminous buried agn signatures at other wavelengths , and we found that their hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios were generally higher than starburst galaxies with l@xmath17 @xmath13 10@xmath18l@xmath4 .",
    "this result supports the presence of luminous buried agns in these observed ulirgs .",
    "however , scenarios that try to explain large hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperatures ratios , without invoking luminous agns , have been present .",
    "examples include the high turbulence @xcite or high density @xcite of molecular gas .",
    "in fact , ulirgs have very dense , highly disturbed molecular gas compared to normal lirgs with l@xmath17 @xmath13 10@xmath18l@xmath4 ( i.e. , non - ulirgs ) @xcite .",
    "observations of normal lirgs ( non - ulirgs ) , with or without buried agn signatures , would help elucidate whether the high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios in observed ulirgs are indeed caused by luminous buried agns , or are simply due to different molecular gas properties in ulirgs .    in this paper , we present the results of interferometric , simultaneous hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) observations of such normal lirgs ( non - ulirgs ) , to investigate the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios in the nuclear regions .",
    "this is the final paper of our series of interferometric hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) surveys of lirgs using nma @xcite .",
    "ancillary ground - based infrared @xmath19- ( 1.92.5 @xmath9 m ) and @xmath20- ( 2.84.1 @xmath9 m ) band spectra are also utilized to better understand the hidden energy sources of these millimeter - observed lirg nuclei . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt h@xmath21 @xmath22 75 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 = 0.3 , and @xmath25 = 0.7 , to be consistent with our previously published papers .",
    "we observed the four lirgs , ngc 2623 , mrk 266 , arp 193 , and ngc 1377 , primarily because they were non - ulirgs with or without buried agn signatures and so were appropriate sources to address the above - mentioned issue ( @xmath261 ) , and because we estimated that we could detect hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) emission with nma in a reasonable amount of telescope time .",
    "table 1 summarizes the infrared emission properties of these lirgs .",
    "an angular scale of 1@xmath27 corresponds to a physical size of 0.120.53 kpc at the redshifts of these lirgs ( @xmath28 = 0.0060.028 ) .",

    "however , high spatial resolution ground - based infrared 10-@xmath9 m imaging observations reveal that the bulk of the 10-@xmath9 m emission in ngc 2623 comes from compact nuclear cores with @xmath13400 pc , the surface brightness of which can be as high as @xmath510@xmath7l@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this value is close to the maximum found in starburst phenomena @xcite .",
    "the 210 kev x - ray emission from ngc 2623 is characterized by a hard spectrum , suggesting that the scattered component of x - ray emission from a compton thick ( n@xmath10 @xmath2 10@xmath11 cm@xmath8 ) agn dominates the observed 210 kev x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic agn luminosity is highly dependent on the unknown value of the scattering efficiency , and can be high if the efficiency is low .",

    "mrk 266 ( ngc 5256 ; z = 0.028 ) is a lirg ( l@xmath17 = 10@xmath29l@xmath4 ) , consisting of two main merging nuclei separated by @xmath510 arcsec , a south - western ( sw ) and north - eastern ( ne ) nucleus @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy by various groups suggested that the sw nucleus shows clear seyfert 2 signatures but the ne one does not @xcite .",

    "are mainly used in our discussions for the following reasons .",
    "first , since hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) have similarly high dipole moments ( @xmath9 @xmath2 3 debye ; botschwina et al . 1993 ; millar et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is very likely that similar high - density molecular gas is probed with both lines .",
    "next , as both the hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) lines are observed simultaneously with the same nma array configuration , their beam patterns are virtually identical .",
    "finally , both hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) fluxes are measured at the same time with the same receiver and same correlator unit , under the same weather conditions , so that possible _ absolute _ flux calibration uncertainties of interferometric data do not propagate to the ratio , which is dominated by statistical noise and fitting errors ( see fig .",
    "7 ) .    in fig .",
    "11 , we note the following points : first , ngc 1377 exhibits a high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio , as seen in agn - dominated galaxy nuclei .",
    "second , the mrk 266 ne nucleus shows a significantly higher ratio than the sw nucleus .",
    "finally , the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios of mrk 266 sw and arp 193 are low , as observed in starburst galaxies , and that of ngc 2623 is higher than mrk 266 sw and arp 193 .      in this subsection",
    ", we look for buried agn signatures in the infrared spectra of individual lirg nuclei and then investigate their hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios . in doing so",
    ", we have to account for the fact that starburst activity surrounds the central compact buried agn , so starburst emission is less obscured by gas and dust than the buried agn emission . the contribution from the buried agn to the observed infrared flux",
    "can be small , even if the buried agn is intrinsically luminous and is energetically important , due to dust extinction .",
    "thus , we need to examine the infrared spectra carefully .      although optical spectroscopy by various groups has failed to find agn signatures in the mrk 266 ne nucleus @xcite , buried agn signatures are discernible in our infrared spectra . first , mrk 266 ne shows a high h@xmath44(10 ) s(1 ) to br@xmath43 flux ratio , @xmath2 1 ( table 7 ) .",
    "observationally , starburst galaxies show h@xmath44(10 ) s(1 ) to br@xmath43 flux ratios of @xmath131 @xcite , while high h@xmath44(10 ) s(1 ) to br@xmath43 flux ratios ( @xmath21 ) are found in optical agns (= seyfert galaxies ) @xcite , as well as buried agn candidates @xcite .",
    "next , the rest - frame equivalent width of the 3.3-@xmath9 m pah emission of mrk 266 ne ( ew@xmath53 @xmath5 30 nm ; table 8) is significantly smaller than that observed in starburst galaxies ( @xmath5100 nm ; moorwood 1986 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) , suggesting that a pah - free agn - heated hot dust continuum contributes significantly to the observed 34 @xmath9 m flux of mrk 266 ne .",
    "the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio of mrk 266 ne is also higher than that of the mrk 266 sw nucleus .",
    "a putative buried agn , suggested from x - ray data @xcite , may enhance the hcn(10 ) emission in mrk 266 ne .",
    "the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio of ngc 1377 is high , as found in agns .",
    "the infrared @xmath20-band spectrum is also dominated by pah - free continuum emission @xcite , as usually seen in agns .",
    "the strong 9.7 @xmath9 m silicate dust absorption feature detected in the _ spitzer _ irs infrared 535 @xmath9 m spectrum @xcite is also incompatible with a normal starburst , where stellar energy sources and dust are spatially well mixed .",
    "it requires a buried agn - type centrally concentrated energy source geometry @xcite .",
    "these overall observational results are naturally explained by the presence of a luminous buried agn in ngc 1377 .",
    "a pah - free continuum and strong 9.7-@xmath9 m silicate dust absorption could be explained by an exceptionally centrally concentrated extreme starburst whose emitting volume is predominantly occupied with hii - regions , with virtually no molecular gas and photo - dissociation regions ( fig .",
    "1e of imanishi et al .",
    "unlike ulirgs with l@xmath17 @xmath2 10@xmath18l@xmath4 , the absolute infrared luminosity of ngc 1377 is only @xmath510@xmath32l@xmath4 , which could be accounted for by a small number of super star cluster whose emitting size is very small ( @xmath54100 pc ) and emission surface brightness is high @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite preferred such a compact starburst ( super star cluster ) scenario , but ruled out the possibility of an energetically important buried agn , based on the following arguments : ( 1 ) estimated smbh mass is too small to account for the luminosity of ngc 1377 with agn activity , and ( 2 ) high excitation forbidden emission lines , usually seen in seyfert galaxies , are not detected .    regarding the first point ,",
    "the smbh mass was estimated to be @xmath132 @xmath15 10@xmath55m@xmath4 , from the observed radio 20-cm ( 1.5-ghz ) continuum flux and the small line width of the infrared h@xmath44(10 ) s(1 ) emission line ( fwhm @xmath13 25 km s@xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "the measured line width of millimeter co(10 ) lines in our nma spectrum ( figure 6 ) is @xmath5100 km s@xmath23 in fwhm .",
    "after correction for the velocity resolution of nma data ( @xmath542 km s@xmath23 ; @xmath263.1 ) , we obtain the intrinsic co(10 ) line width of @xmath590 km s@xmath23 in fwhm , which is similar to the sest 15-m telescope measurement @xcite . assuming the co(10 ) line width and smbh mass relation given by @xcite , the measured co(10 ) line width provides a similar smbh mass of @xmath52 @xmath15 10@xmath55m@xmath4 .",
    "the eddington luminosity of this smbh mass is @xmath57 @xmath15 10@xmath56l@xmath4 .",
    "this is only slightly below the observed infrared luminosity ( @xmath51 @xmath15 10@xmath57l@xmath4 ) . in a buried agn",
    ", the infrared luminosity should be comparable to the bolometric luminosity , because almost all of the energetic radiation from the central agn is absorbed by the surrounding dust and re - emitted as infrared thermal dust emission .",
    "thus , even if current constraints on the supermassive black hole mass are accurate , it is still possible that the bulk of the observed luminosity in ngc 1377 comes from buried agn activity .",
    "however , uncertainties in the estimated smbh mass in ngc 1377 could exist .",
    "first , the observed 20-cm flux from a buried agn can be severely attenuated by free - free absorption , possibly leading to an underestimate of the smbh mass .",
    "second , the line width of h@xmath44(10 ) s(1 ) emission is not well calibrated for an smbh mass estimate . finally , in the small line width range of millimeter co(10 )",
    "( @xmath13100 km s@xmath23 ) , the smbh mass estimated from co(10 ) line width yields systematically smaller results than other measurements @xcite .",
    "hence , the actual smbh mass in ngc 1377 could be higher than above estimates .",
    "regarding the second point , the non - detection of high excitation emission lines is a natural consequence of a buried agn because the central agn is obscured by dust and gas along virtually all directions at the inner part ( @xmath131 pc ) , producing virtually no narrow line regions (= the main emitting sources of high excitation lines ) .",
    "therefore , none of the currently available observational results preclude the presence of a luminous buried agn in ngc 1377 .",
    "strong h@xmath44 emission is observed in ngc 1377 @xcite . in general ,",
    "h@xmath44 emission is stronger in agns than starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "although a major galaxy merger could produce strong h@xmath44 emission @xcite , ngc 1377 shows no sign of a major merger @xcite .",
    "energy source obscuration for ngc 1377 is extremely high @xcite , and the observed low radio to infrared luminosity ratio @xcite could be explained by severe flux attenuation of the radio 20-cm ( 1.5 ghz ) emission by free - free absorption .",
    "the ew@xmath53 and co@xmath46 values , and the h@xmath44(10 ) s(1 ) to br@xmath43 flux ratio of ngc 2623 are all within starburst range .",
    "the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios are slightly higher than arp 193 and mrk 266 sw , which may be due to an hcn(10 ) emission enhancement by an x - ray detected buried agn ( see @xmath262 ) .",
    "the large ew@xmath53 and co@xmath46 values , the small h@xmath44(10 ) s(1 ) to br@xmath43 flux ratios , and the small hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios of mrk 266 sw and arp 193 are all explained by starburst activity only , with no significant agn contribution required .",
    "one natural explanation for the high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios found in agns is an hcn abundance enhancement .",
    "if molecular gas consists of small dense gas clumps with low volume filling factor , as widely supported from observations @xcite , an enhanced hcn abundance can result in higher hcn(10 ) flux regardless of whether the hcn(10 ) emission is optically thin or thick @xcite .",
    "several chemical calculations of hcn abundance in molecular gas around uv- and x - ray emitting energy sources have been published @xcite .",
    "although an hcn abundance enhancement around an x - ray emitting energy source ( i.e. , agn ) is predicted in some parameter ranges that are realistic for molecular gas around buried agns in lirgs ( high - f@xmath58 range of table 3 in meijerink et al .",
    "2006 ) , an hcn abundance _",
    "decrease _ is suggested in other reasonable parameter ranges @xcite .",
    "the chemical calculation results are highly dependent on parameters , and it is currently unclear whether an hcn abundance is indeed enhanced in molecular gas in the close vicinity of buried agns in lirg nuclei .    the second possible explanation for the strong hcn(10 ) emission in agns is an infrared radiative pumping scenario @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that molecular gas is excited by collision .",
    "however , the hcn molecule has a line at infrared 14 @xmath9 m that can be excited by absorbing photons at @xmath59 14 @xmath9 m .",
    "hcn(10 ) emission in the millimeter wavelength range could be enhanced through a cascade process . since the emission surface brightness of an agn is high , much of the surrounding dust is heated to several 100 k , producing strong mid - infrared 1020 @xmath9 m emission ( @xmath261 ) .",
    "hence , this infrared radiative pumping scenario for hcn could work effectively in agns .",
    "hco@xmath0 also has a line at infrared 12 @xmath9 m , so that the infrared radiative pumping mechanism could work in a similar way .",
    "observationally , the 14 @xmath9 m hcn absorption features are detected in highly obscured lirgs @xcite , but the 12 @xmath9 m hco@xmath0 absorption features are not @xcite .",
    "it may be that this infrared radiative pumping scenario is working more effectively for hcn than hco@xmath0 , possibly enhancing the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios in agns .    to test this infrared radiative pumping scenario , in figure 12 we compare the observed hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio with the infrared emission surface brightness estimated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use the infrared emission surface brightness , rather than infrared luminosity @xcite , because the bulk of the observed normal lirgs with @xmath1310@xmath18l@xmath4 ( i.e. , non - ulirgs ) are chosen because they display luminous buried agn signatures .",
    "although @xcite found an increasing trend of hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios with increasing galaxy infrared luminosities , our heterogeneous sample selection of normal lirgs ( non - ulirgs ) could be biased to agn candidates (= strong hcn emitters ) and artificially eliminate this trend .",
    "the infrared radiative pumping scenario can , in principle , enhance the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio , even for a low absolute infrared luminosity galaxy ( e.g. ngc 1377 ) , if infrared emission surface brightness is high .    in fig .",
    "12 , we may see a weak correlation but the scatter is large and the total sample size is small .",
    "based on our current dataset , we can not determine whether the infrared radiative pumping scenario is indeed at work in buried agns at lirg s nuclei .",
    "further detailed theoretical calculations that realistically incorporate the actual energy level populations of hcn and hco@xmath0 , as well as the clumpy structure of molecular gas around an agn @xcite , are needed to properly interpret the origin of strong hcn(10 ) emission in agns .",
    "combination with higher transition lines in the submillimeter wavelength range @xcite will also help better understand the physical properties of molecular gas in lirg s nuclei .",
    "we presented the results of millimeter interferometric simultaneous hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) observations of four lirgs using nma . when combined with previously observed lirgs , ours is the largest lirg interferometric hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) survey .",
    "from our interferometric data , we extracted the hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) fluxes at the nuclei , where putative agns are expected to be present .",
    "we derived the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios of the observed lirg nuclei and compared them with the ratios found in agns and starburst galaxies .",
    "the main result of this paper is the confirmation of the previously discovered trend that lirgs with luminous buried agn signatures at other wavelengths tend to show higher hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios than those without .",
    "this reinforces the utility of the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio as a powerful observational tool for discovering elusive agns deeply buried in dust and molecular gas .",
