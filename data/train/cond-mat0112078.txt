    "advances in quantum computing software research,@xcite such as the invention of factorization algorithm and quantum error correction codes , have prompted active and extensive search for an appropriate physical system for implementation of quantum computation.@xcite for example , there has been considerable recent interest in the study of donor impurities in silicon , particularly the si:@xmath0p system , because of the potential of the monovalent @xmath0p impurities to act as fundamental units of a solid state quantum computer ( qc ) .",
    "the first si - based qc architecture , proposed by kane,@xcite has drawn immense interest from the experimental community . in kane",
    "s proposal the nuclear spins of phosphorus ( @xmath0p ) donors are the quantum bits ( qubits ) , while the donor electrons act as shuttles between neighboring nuclear spins .",
    "isotopically purified @xmath1si host provides a quiet environment with very long coherence times for both donor electronic and nuclear spins@xcite since it has been known for a long time@xcite that the electron spin coherence time in si is extremely long .",
    "two - qubit operations , which are required for a universal quantum computer , involve precise control over electron - electron exchange@xcite and electron - nucleus hyperfine interactions .",
    "a closely related alternative design was proposed later,@xcite involving @xmath0p donors in si / ge heterostructures , with the spins of the donor electrons ( rather than the nuclear spins ) serving as qubits .",
    "the basic ingredients underlying the si qc proposals are schematically presented and described in fig .",
    "[ fig : computers ] .",
    "there are also other recent qc proposals based on si or si / ge host materials.@xcite although these are interesting and promising proposals , particularly due to the extensive infrastructural base available in the existing si microelectronics technology , there are formidable experimental challenges to be overcome in device fabrication , coherent control , system integration , and single spin measurement , among other important issues , before a si - based qc architecture could become an experimental reality even on a laboratory scale .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress in the fabrication of donor arrays in silicon single crystal , using both a `` top - down '' approach with ion - implantation , and a `` bottom - up '' approach with mbe growth and stm technique.@xcite theoretically , we have recently shown@xcite that electron exchange in bulk silicon has fast atomic scale spatial oscillations due to the valley interference arising from the very special six - fold degeneracy of the bulk si conduction band .",
    "these oscillations place heavy burdens on the device fabrication and coherent control because of the extremely high precision requirement for placing each donor inside the si unit cell and/or for controlling the external gate voltages .",
    "several authors@xcite have pointed out that si - based quantum computing architectures involving epitaxial si / si@xmath2ge@xmath3 heterostructures possess some practical advantages over the original scheme based on relaxed bulk si.@xcite one of the motivations is the need for a barrier material separating the si host containing @xmath0p donors from the conducting gates ( see fig  [ fig : computers ] ) .",
    "the si / barrier - material interface must be free of structural defects .",
    "although high quality si / oxide barriers can be fabricated , si / si@xmath2ge@xmath3 and si / si@xmath2c@xmath3 are strong candidates for qc architectures because of the good interface quality associated with their epitaxial nature .",
    "these alloys have advantages over the oxide barriers ( e.g. sio@xmath4 ) in terms of chemical compatibility among the group iv elements , which share the diamond lattice structure , while still providing sufficiently high barriers for the donor electrons to prevent leak into / from the gates . in spite of sharing the same lattice structure , c , si and ge present very large lattice mismatches ( lattice parameters 3.57  , 5.43  , and 5.66  , respectively ) , leading to the presence of strained layers in heterostructures containing commensurately grown materials .",
    "the highly strained nature of these epitaxial systems ( arising from their large lattice mismatch ) in fact is crucial in producing high quality defect free interface since dislocations are avoided due to the strain build - up .    given our earlier finding of band - degeneracy - induced strong oscillations in the donor exchange energy ( as a function of individual donor positioning within the si unit cell ) of bulk si , it is natural to ask how donor exchange behaves in strained si heterostructure or quantum well systems , where one must now incorporate strain effects in the exchange calculation . in this paper",
    "we carry out such a calculation of strain effects on exchange energy , and emphasize an additional feature of @xmath0p - doped strained si quantum wells ( qws ) favoring such architectures over architectures based on relaxed bulk si for qc implementation .",
    "recall that two - qubit operations of a si qc rely on the exchange coupling between the wave functions of neighboring donor atoms .",
    "the six - fold degeneracy in the conduction band edge of si leads to oscillations in the exchange coupling,@xcite which pose formidable experimental problems in controlling both the fabrication ( in terms of donor positioning within the crystal ) and the actual operation ( in terms of surface gate bias ) of the qc .",
    "we demonstrate below that these problems are partially solved for impurity pairs in strained si grown over si / ge alloys due to altered lattice and band structure . unfortunately , however , we find that some parts of the exchange oscillation problem persist even in these strained systems as we discuss in this paper .    in the following ,",
    "we first discuss how to describe theoretically the effects of strain in silicon .",
    "we then discuss the calculation of the donor exchange energy via an effective heitler - london approximation .",
    "finally we present our results and discuss their implications and validity .",
    "the details of our heitler - london calculation are given in the appendix .",
    "epitaxial growth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) allow the fabrication of lattice - mismatched heterostructures free of misfit defect generation when the layers are sufficiently thin ( and the lattice mismatch is not extremely large).@xcite the mismatch is completely accommodated by uniform lattice strain and the interatomic distances parallel to the interfacial plane , i.e. the `` effective '' lattice constants in the plane , remain equal to the equilibrium value of the substrate material .",
    "the lattice constants perpendicular to the interface adjust appropriately in order to minimize the total elastic energy in the strained layer .",
    "this so - called commensurate growth lowers the energy of the interfacial atoms at the expense of increasing the elastic ( strain ) energy stored in the chemical bonds in the coherently strained layers.@xcite we refer to these layers as uniaxially strained . depending on whether the interatomic distances parallel to the interface are larger or smaller than the relaxed equilibrium value",
    ", the strain is called tensile or compressive . the structural variations involved in this process",
    "modify the electronic properties of the layered materials and consequently the substitutional impurities in the strained layers .",

    "uniaxially strained si has lower symmetry than relaxed si , and thus a different reciprocal lattice ( body centered tetragonal instead of body centered cubic ) and brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "herring and vogt@xcite have shown that the small tetragonal distortions cause changes in the conduction band minima of si that can be quantitatively described by shifts in the energies of the local minima of the six valleys , while the reciprocal - space positions and shapes of the constant - energy surfaces remain unchanged to first order in strain .",

    "ii , we believe that our approach is well - suited for the modestly strained systems considered here . for highly strained systems ( such as si grown on si@xmath2c@xmath57 with high concentration of carbon ) , the separation of @xmath49 into @xmath50 and @xmath168 may not be justifiable , and all matrix elements should be consistently assessed to determine how they depend on strain .    in our envelope function approach , we have adopted the variational form and parameters obtained from the one - valley kohn - luttinger treatment .",
    "calculations incorporating the valley - orbit interactions and strain in the original hamiltonian , and treating the effective bohr radii @xmath71 and @xmath70 and the valley compositions as independent variational parameters ( imposing symmetry and normalization constrains ) , would have led to a better quantitative description of the ground state binding energy and possibly the wave function .",
    "such calculations for donors in si have been performed to determine the binding energies using only spherically symmetric trial wave functions,@xcite which is not adequate for the present study .",
    "our interest in this paper is not in obtaining extremely accurate donor binding energies , but in calculating reasonably good wavefunctions so as to obtain reliable donor exchange energies .",
    "atomistic _ ab initio _ studies based on density - functional schemes can overcome the limitations of the envelope - function / effective - mass theory and have been employed in the literature to study effects of strain@xcite and alloy disorder.@xcite the difficulty in describing a single shallow impurity originates from the underlying supercell approach with periodic boundary conditions , which leads to spurious effects due to interactions between the impurity and its periodic replicas .",
    "extrapolation schemes towards an infinite supercell have been proposed for the single impurity binding energy,@xcite although periodic boundary conditions cause additional difficulties for a reliable description of the asymptotic behavior of the wave functions .",
    "the hl approximation adopted in this paper is the simplest approach to calculate exchange coupling in a variety of situations , such as atomic lattices,@xcite random donor arrays,@xcite and double quantum dots.@xcite improvement can be made through various ways .",
    "for instance , it is quite common to use the valence bond theory ( also called the molecular orbital theory ) or the configuration interaction ( often combined with a self - consistent mean field calculation ) approach to obtain more accurate spectra ( and thus exchange interaction when specifically pursued ) for molecules or quantum dots.@xcite for donor arrays in si ( relaxed or strained ) , such calculations will be complicated by the si band structure .",
    "however , as we have shown in the current study , as long as the effective bohr radius is much larger than the lattice spacing , one can separate the fast oscillating ( due to the bloch functions ) parts of integrals for the matrix elements from the slowly varying envelope function parts , thus simplifying the calculation .",
    "indeed , there should be no significant theoretical difficulty for a more complete molecular orbital calculation for donors in si . in the current study ,",
    "our focus is on the qualitative behavior of the exchange coupling between two donors , therefore we have not attempted to improve upon the hl approximation .",
    "this can be easily done following earlier calculations in gaas quantum dots@xcite if the experimental development warrants such improvements of the theory .",
    "in addition , the proposed si qc would operate under a uniform magnetic field of 1 to 2 tesla applied along the @xmath36 axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : computers ] ) .",
    "previous studies@xcite indicate that uniform magnetic fields of up to 2 tesla have no qualitative effect in the exchange coupling of electrons in double quantum dot bound states . for a pair of donors , a reduction in @xmath139 due to the shrinking of the envelopes perpendicular to the magnetic field direction and magnetic phase interference",
    "should be expected , but this should not lead to any qualitatively different effect .    as we have mentioned before , in our calculation",
    "we have approximated the bloch functions by the corresponding plane wave functions , which is in essence a free electron approximation for the conduction band of si.@xcite the approximation here amounts to keeping only the @xmath169 term ( and let @xmath170 ) in the reciprocal lattice expansion of the periodic part of the bloch functions .",
    "the plane wave approximation actually obtains the exact results for lattice points on the same fcc lattice , where @xmath171 so that the sums over reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath172 are normalized to 1 .",
    "however , for an arbitrary @xmath158 , our calculation should mostly give an _ upper bound _ to an exact hl calculation .",
    "if the @xmath173 coefficients have a broad distribution , the sums would tend to be much smaller since they involve the fourth power of @xmath173 as is shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exchl ] ) .",
    "thus the continuous lines in our figures ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exch - x ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : hl - a ] ) should be taken more as guides to the eye than as the actual values of exchange , which can be much smaller .",
    "as mentioned before , we carry out our exact heitler - london exchange coupling calculations only for discrete values of inter - donor separation ( triangles , squares , etc . in the figures ) whereas the continuous curves represent the free electron hl approximation .",
    "further calculations are underway to go beyond the free electron approximation to address this issue , and those results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our results for si uniaxially strained along the @xmath36 axis indicate that , for @xmath174 , inaccuracies in the positioning of substitutional @xmath0p donor pairs within the @xmath8-@xmath43 plane produce only small effects in the electron exchange coupling .",
    "naturally , the next question is whether it is possible to avoid the oscillatory behavior due to lattice - parameter - scale inaccuracies in the @xmath157 component of the relative position between a pair of donors . as noted in sec .",
    "iii , these oscillations in @xmath133 are due to the specific form of the ground state wave function ( [ eq : wavef ] ) , which dictates that the contribution from the two valley minima are equally important .",
    "this result is in turn a consequence of the degeneracy of the @xmath175 and @xmath176 valleys in bulk si , whose energies are lowered equally with respect to the four perpendicular valleys by uniaxial tensile strain .",
    "the same effect occurs in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in ( 001 ) si / sio@xmath4 inversion layers@xcite and si / si@xmath2ge@xmath57 quantum wells@xcite where , due to the confining potential at the interface , the lowest electronic subbands originate from the bulk si @xmath175 and @xmath176 valleys alone .",
    "it has been shown theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite that this valley degeneracy may be lifted in heterostructure - type configurations , leading to experimental _ valley splittings _ of the order of 0.1 mev .",
    "such splittings refer to the unperturbed doubly - degenerate ground states , and the resulting singlet ground state is not one of the @xmath175 and @xmath176 valleys , but an equally weighted admixture of these states.@xcite in the present case , @xmath50 alone leads to a nondegenerate ground state , which is 12 mev below the first excited state . under the @xmath168 perturbation ,",
    "the ground state remains nondegenerate , with an energy separation to the first excited state reduced , but still larger than 3 mev .",
    "further perturbations , e.g. @xmath116 that produces the valley splitting observed in the 2deg , have negligible quantitative impact in any of the results obtained here .",
    "moreover , perturbations of the form @xmath116 always lead to an equally weighted admixture of the @xmath175 and @xmath176 valleys , thus donor electron valley composition always has contributions from these two valleys with the same weight , i.e. @xmath177 in ( [ eq : wavef ] ) .",
    "we note that for ge , where four conduction band minima occur at the inequivalent @xmath178 points in the bz , @xmath179 tensile strain leads to a nondegenerate band minimum .",
    "since the lattice parameter of ge is larger than that of si and c , this possibility within group - iv semiconductors remains restricted to ge - rich strained alloys grown over relaxed ge,@xcite with the additional complication of bringing alloy disorder effects into the non - degenerate ground state layer where the donors are placed .",
    "we do not consider ge in this paper since there is no particular experimental effort directed toward the design of a ge - based qc .",
    "static electric fields generated by the top gates can be used to slightly modify the donor electron wavefunction in its shape and weight distribution , so that such fields can be used to overcome lattice - parameter - scale inaccuracies in the @xmath157 component of the relative position of a pair of substitutional impurities .",
    "a crude estimate of the uniform static electric field effects in the donor bound states may be inferred from results for the hydrogen atom.@xcite to the first order in the field , the h ground state wave function in the presence of a uniform electric field @xmath180 along @xmath181 is given by @xmath182\\ , ,   \\label{eq : field}\\ ] ] where @xmath183   is the bohr radius , and @xmath184 is the electron charge .",
    "the expectation value of the electron position is thus shifted by the field from @xmath185 to @xmath186 , which corresponds to an average displacement of @xmath187   for @xmath188 kv / cm .",
    "this negligible shift is greatly enhanced for donor bound states in si . assuming a spherically averaged envelope with an effective bohr radius @xmath189 , we get @xmath190 , where @xmath191 it the si dielectric constant",
    ". an average position shift of one monolayer ( 1ml = a@xmath12/2 = 2.7    in si ) thus corresponds to @xmath192 kv / cm . in the current context , it is plausible to expect that a uniform electric field of tens of kv / cm may compensate for atomic misplacements of a few monolayers along the field direction .",
    "it is interesting to note that , according to eq.([eq : field ] ) , the applied field would have no first - order effect on the electron - nucleus hyperfine coupling , which is proportional to the electronic density at the nuclear site , @xmath193 . since the a - gates are primarily meant to reduce this coupling by pulling the electron wavefunction away from the donor towards the barrier , fields much stronger than those quoted above are required to perform such operations .",
    "in the strong field limit , donor ionization starts to take place .",
    "the field dependence of the dissociation rate for atomic h is@xcite @xmath194 which means that dissociation becomes appreciable for field values in the order of @xmath195 kv / cm . under the spherically averaged envelope assumptions above , we estimate that donor ionization in si would require fields of the order of @xmath196 { \\cal e}_{\\rm h } \\cong 5.3 \\times 10^{-5 } { \\cal e}_{\\rm h } \\sim 300 $ ] kv / cm , which is one order of magnitude larger than the fields required to compensate for atomic displacements of a few ml .",
    "we have shown in this paper that strained si grown commensurately over relaxed si@xmath2ge@xmath57 ( 001 ) alloys presents clear theoretical advantages over relaxed si as a host material for @xmath0p donor impurities in si - based qc architectures . since the same is not true for strained si grown on si@xmath2c@xmath57 substrates , here we focus on growth of strained si over relaxed si@xmath2ge@xmath57 alloys .",
    "one important limiting factor in the fabrication of strained si layers is the so - called _ critical thickness _",
    ", @xmath197 , the thickness above which the strained layer relaxes by forming topological defects , typically misfit dislocations which originate at the interface and propagate into the bulk.@xcite theoretical estimates through an energy minimization criterion@xcite show a sharp decay of @xmath197 with the alloy ge content , from over 1000    for @xmath198 to 100    for @xmath199 .",
    "recent advances in epitaxial growth of si / ge heterostructures have led to the fabrication of samples of 100    thick si layers over relaxed si@xmath2ge@xmath57 alloys with @xmath8 up to 0.3,@xcite with interfaces of extremely good quality and free of dislocations .",
    "also , 150    thick layers over @xmath16 alloys were recently produced.@xcite in both cases , the layer thickness is below ( but very close to ) the theoretical upper bound for @xmath197 .",
    "substrate layers with relatively high ge - content ( @xmath200 ) serve two useful purposes in the context of qc architecture : ( i ) the strained si layer leads to improved behavior of exchange coupling between donor impurity states ; ( ii ) the relaxed alloy layer serves as a barrier separating the si host containing @xmath0p donors from the conducting gates.@xcite such values of alloy composition @xmath8 , leading to valley strain @xmath201 , also impose some limitations in the implementation of the si - based qc .",
    "the magnitude of strain means an upper bound of around 200    for the thickness of the strained si layer , a reduction in the hyperfine coupling , and a reduction in the energy splitting between the ground and the first excited state by a factor of 3 with respect to the relaxed si architectures .",
    "alloys with lower ge content ( @xmath202 ) with valley strain parameter @xmath203 provide comparable electronic performance ( actually somewhat improved performance in terms of the strength of the hyperfine coupling ) and greatly enhanced values of @xmath197 , over 1000  .",
    "this would obviously facilitate most aspects of the design and fabrication of the si layers .",
    "on the other hand , the low - ge - content alloys do not provide a sufficiently high potential barrier , thus one would have to use the more conventional sio@xmath4 barriers between the strained si and the top gates .",
    "our results refer to structures of strained si commensurately grown over relaxed random alloys .",
    "the inevitable substrate alloy disorder can pose some potential difficulties .",
    "indeed , some randomness in the lattice spacing and thus in strain is bound to occur at the alloy / si interface .",
    "however , this effect quickly decays inside the si layer . since we consider donors located as far as 100    ( @xmath204 twenty lattice spacings in si ) away from the interface , any alloy disorder effect should be negligible , leading to a uniformly strained si host for all practical purposes . on the other hand , if a device is based on an heterostructure predominantly formed by si@xmath2ge@xmath57/si@xmath205ge@xmath206 strained layers ( alloy on alloy ) , as considered in ref .  , and the donors are located inside an alloy layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : computers](b ) ) , random strain and local chemical disorder would presumably play a much more important role in determining the donor electronic properties , including exchange and hyperfine couplings .",
    "the electronic properties of a single impurity is sensitive to local composition fluctuations , which will certainly influence the performance and reproducibility in the fabrication of such devices .",
    "another suggested alloy,@xcite si@xmath2c@xmath57 , presents a much larger lattice mismatch within the alloy layer , leading to a much stronger randomness in local strain , which implies a higher probability of defects and smaller critical thickness if one attempts to grow strained si on top of such a substrate .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve hydrogenic behavior for substitutional donors positioned exactly in the same ( 001 ) lattice plane parallel to the interface with the alloy substrate .",
    "for the recently proposed@xcite `` bottom - up '' approach for si qc fabrication , in which mbe growth is followed by positioning individual p impurity on the surface with the help of an stm tip , our result implies that small displacements of the p atoms due to surface diffusion or hops among the si atoms forming dimers at the si(001)@xmath207 surface should be acceptable for the reliability of qc operations mediated by exchange coupling .",
    "the final stage of the `` bottom - up '' approach involves si overgrowth , encapsulating the deposited p donors .",
    "this is a crucial step for either relaxed or strained si , since any atomic - scale @xmath36-component added to the relative position @xmath128 leads to oscillatory behavior and possibly strong reduction of @xmath139 . in mbe growth ,",
    "surface binding and elastic energy differences among the various species lead to segregation effects , driving p atoms from previously grown layers into newly deposited ones .",
    "segregation may be reduced by lowering the growth temperature and by increasing the growth rate,@xcite but it may not be eliminated entirely . in a different , `` top - down '' , approach , the p array in si is formed by ion - implantation techniques , which implies a low degree of control over @xmath157 on a lattice - parameter length scale .",
    "residual variations in the relative positions of the donors must be corrected by individually calibrating the a and j gates . in other words , one must rely on probing and `` correcting '' each donor bound state through the surface gates . in general , our work establishes that si qc design could tolerate some imprecision in the positioning of the dopant atoms in a 2d layer parallel to the interface , but any lack of precise control in the @xmath36 direction could be fatal .",
    "we point out an additional advantage of strained over relaxed si according to our numerical results . following all overgrowth stages , one",
    "a gate must be placed on top of each buried impurity and one j gate in - between neighboring impurity pairs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : computers](a ) ) .",
    "we have shown that the exchange coupling is enhanced for donor pairs parallel to the interface in negatively strained si configurations .",
    "this allows for larger inter - donor distances as compared to relaxed si , which is particularly convenient in terms of fabricating and accurately positioning the external gates .    finally , we point out the obvious fact that , although we have emphasized the relevance of our theory to si qc architectures throughout this paper , our work is of general validity completely transcending qc considerations and context . in particular",
    ", we have developed a theory for calculating the donor exchange energy in strained si systems incorporating the quantum interference effect arising from the multiple valley structure of si conduction band .",
    "our results should apply to any problem involving si donor exchange coupling considerations .",
