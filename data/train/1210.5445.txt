    "topological insulators ( tis ) are time - reversal - invariant systems with gapped bulk and protected massless dirac modes at the surface.@xcite very soon after the discovery of tis , theorists generalized this concept to topological superconductors , which are characterized by a superconducting ( sc ) gap in the bulk and protected gapless majorana surface modes.@xcite semiconductors like the bismuth chalcogenides with strong spin - orbit coupling and a fermi surface centered at the time - reversal - invariant momentum , are of particular interest because of their single helical dirac cone at the surface.@xcite copper - doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is an unconventional superconductor  @xcite with non - trivial surface states and a band structure similar to that of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 but with shifted chemical potential , reduced fermi velocity , and enlarged surface dispersion.@xcite    by now , the surface states in cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 have been probed by photoemission@xcite and point contact spectroscopy.@xcite while the experiments @xcite find evidence for midgap states and hence topological superconductivity , no such states were found in refs . .",
    "as a result , the question about the pairing symmetry of cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 can not be clearly answered from point contact spectroscopy at the moment , and results obtained by complementary experimental techniques are desirable . nuclear magnetic resonance",
    "( nmr ) and quadrupole resonance , as well as the electron and muon spin resonance ( @xmath3sr ) are another class of powerful techniques to investigate the electronic properties locally .",
    "the knight shift for example is determined by the static spin susceptibility @xmath4 , which is directly connected to the spin structure of the sc pairing . in conventional @xmath5-wave superconductors with spin - singlet pairing",
    ", the knight shift is significantly reduced and vanishes for @xmath6 because spins pair up and longitudinal spin excitations cost the pair - breaking energy @xmath7 . however , in superconductors with strong spin - orbit coupling the spin susceptibility is suppressed as compared to the normal state but does not vanish for @xmath6 due to coupling between up and down spins.@xcite in this paper , we study characteristic features in the spin response of odd - parity pairing in doped tis and predict clear signatures for the above resonance techniques .",
    "fu and berg@xcite showed that strong spin - orbit - coupled bands indeed favor an odd - parity interorbital unequal - spin pairing.@xcite to gain insight into its topological non - trivial nature , we map this pairing hamiltonian onto the conduction band , which yields an effective time - reversal invariant @xmath8 pairing in three dimensions . because of this topology , there is a pair of majorana zero - energy modes ( mzm ) located at each surface and protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "additionally there are unconventional surface andreev bound states ( sabss ) originating from the band inversion as shown in ref . for a linear @xmath9 model .",
    "in addition to the linear momenta , we here consider quadratic momentum terms , which determine the energy range of coexistence between dirac modes and unconventional sabss , and which may give rise to another species of zero - energy sabs .",
    "the main motivation for introducing the quadratic terms is the possibility to investigate the competition between the different surface states and the bulk .",
    "the coexistence of the mzms and the sabss originating from the band inversion@xcite gives rise to two characteristic length scales .",
    "the dirac modes decay on the nm scale @xmath10@xcite whereas the decay length @xmath11 for the mzms is hundreds of nm.@xcite hence , the local spin susceptibility shows different characteristic behavior in the bulk , at the surface , and within @xmath11 into the bulk .    the origin for the spin response of the sabs is the helical spin structure of the quasiparticle dispersion . in superconductors with unequal - spin - pairing symmetry ,",
    "the creation operator for a bogoliubov quasiparticle contains a particle component with , say , momentum @xmath12 and spin @xmath13 , and a hole component with momentum @xmath14 and spin @xmath15 .",
    "since a hole with spin @xmath15 is the absence of a particle with spin @xmath15 , this removal of a spin @xmath15 coherently adds up with the addition of a spin @xmath13 particle , and gives rise to a spinful quasiparticle . since , the direction of the quasiparticle spin depends on the direction of momentum @xmath12 , the states at @xmath16 are special , because the direction of their momentum , and as a consequence the direction of their spin , is undetermined . because of time - reversal symmetry , on each surface two modes reside at zero energy and span a two - dimensional vector space .",
    "one special basis of this vector space is determined by quasiparticle operators , which satisfy the majorana criterion , @xmath17 .",
    "these basis vectors are invariant under time - reversal symmetry@xcite and thus the majorana operators itself are `` spinless '' .",
    "similarly , we choose another basis for the quasiparticle operators as superpositions of the majorana operators , @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast to the majorana basis discussed above , these operators are fermion operators with @xmath19 and thus non - hermitian .",
    "furthermore , these operators transform into each other under time - reversal symmetry and in particular they are fully spin polarized with spin @xmath20 in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "we conclude that without loss of generality the zero - energy sabs can be understood as a spinful quasiparticle . from this perspective , it becomes clear , that the mzms contribute to the magnetic properties of the topological superconductor .",
    "in particular , from the spin polarization one can easily see that for a zeeman field in @xmath21 direction , the spinful basis is an eigenbasis of the zeeman coupling and the mzms acquire a finite energy proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , in a spin - polarized @xmath22-wave topological superconductor , the combination of a spin @xmath13 particle component and a spin @xmath13 hole component indeed has zero net spin and would not contribute to the spin response.@xcite    conventional bulk nmr can distinguish between competing pairing symmetries by the characteristic temperature dependence of the knight shift and the spin - lattice relaxation rate .",
    "we propose that nmr in thin films of thickness @xmath23 nm or depth controlled probes@xcite allow to clearly determine the pairing symmetry and investigate the mzms .",
    "our work is motivated by cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , however , our results are more generally relevant for other inversion symmetric materials such as the ternary chalcogenides@xcite and the pbte class.@xcite furthermore , our findings for doped tis are complementary to the superfluid @xmath24he-@xmath25 phase@xcite where spin relaxation reflects the gapless majorana nature .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "if the pairing is induced by long - range interactions , such as the electron - phonon interaction , other unequal - spin pairing channels are also possible.@xcite additionally , we consider ( i ) even - parity , intraorbital pairing @xmath55 ( ii ) odd - parity , intraorbital pairing @xmath56 and ( iii ) even - parity , interorbital pairing @xmath57      in this section , we investigate the doped ti with odd - parity interorbital pairing eq .  .",
    "to study the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the pairing symmetry , we project eq .   onto the basis @xmath58 spanned by the conduction band of the bulk ti eq .  .",
    "for @xmath59 , this yields the effective pairing hamiltonian @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the effective pairing hamiltonian is exact in first order in @xmath63 and yields a gapped bulk excitation spectrum with quasiparticle gap @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding bogoliubov - de gennes equations are in the same universality class as the ones for two copies of spinless superconductors with opposite chirality , which is known to be a time - reversal - invariant topological superconductor with mzms if the chemical potential lies within the conduction band.@xcite from this analogy , we expect to find a kramers pair of mzms for @xmath65 and additionally a pair of zero - energy sabss whenever @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , the bulk single - particle excitation spectrum is always fully gapped with weakly momentum dependent gap @xmath67 .    the hamiltonian eq .   confined in @xmath21 direction has a two - dimensional helical massless dirac cone at the surface.@xcite however , we also know that the effective pairing hamiltonian eq .   yields a pair of helical mzms at the time - reversal - invariant momentum @xmath65.@xcite hence , we obtain two species of surface states originating from the band inversion and the @xmath8 pairing , respectively .",
    "we find these states by replacing @xmath68 and solving the corresponding schrdinger equation with boundary condition @xmath69 , which describes the vanishing of the wave function for orbital 2 at the surface .",
    "this boundary condition is justified by the layered atomic structure of the ti where orbital 2 is underneath the orbital 1 surface layer .    for the normal conducting hamiltonian eq .",

    "[ fig : decay](a ) .",

    "in contrast to the dirac modes , the zero - momentum mzms exist for all values of the chemical potential and enter the bulk for @xmath83 only .",
    "for both species of surface states , the quadratic terms @xmath84 and @xmath85 significantly determine the behavior of the decay lengths .",
    "for @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath88 whereas the decay lengths for @xmath89 strongly depend on the fermi velocity and thus on @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the mzms are immune against band bending effects due to near - surface electrostatic potential variations@xcite since the characteristic length for band bending effects is nm and thus much smaller than the decay length @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the mzms are robust against moderate non - magnetic impurity scattering since pair - breaking effects are suppressed by an approximate chiral symmetry in the spin - orbital locked band structure.@xcite    depending on the doped charge density , the sc state could occur with the chemical potential either in the region where the dirac modes are separated from the bulk conduction band@xcite or where only the bulk states remain . since the numerator of the effective pairing hamiltonian eq .",
    "vanishes for the dirac modes with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , they are not gapped by @xmath92 and yield a ring structure of zero - energy sabss .",
    "higher order terms which couple valence and conduction band , do not change the character of the surface modes qualitatively .",
    "the authors of ref .   showed that a branch of sabss connects the mzm and the dirac modes due to the mirror helicity of the hamiltonian , which here shows up as the sign of the mass @xmath93 in eq . .",
    "this mass is negative near the bottom of the conduction band and changes sign for @xmath94 .",

    "the mass term is negative , and hence , both the mzm and the branch of zero - energy sabs originating from the dirac mode exist . on the other hand , for large chemical potentials , @xmath98 ,",

    "[ fig : kt3](a ) where the strong feature is determined by the bulk and the second line by the dirac modes .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsc_3](c ) we find similarly to the knight shift a qualitatively different behavior for the nmr rate in the bulk and at the surface .",
    "the gapped bulk gives rise to an activation law for @xmath201 and a hebel - slichter coherence peak for @xmath202 .",
    "in contrast , we find a finite @xmath6-value for @xmath168 at the surface which is characteristic for metallic states . the temperature dependence is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kt3](b ) where the rate from the dirac modes is much larger than the rate from the bulk because of the large gapless ldos .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsc_3](d ) we show the imaginary part of the dynamical transverse spin susceptibility as function of excitation energy .",
    "the excitation spectrum shows a very different behavior at the surface and in the bulk . for @xmath203",
    ", there is a continuum of excitations in the bulk which is sharply bounded at @xmath204 .",
    "in addition , we find low - energy spin excitations at the surface and bulk - edge excitations for @xmath205 within a length @xmath10 into the sample .",
    "finally , we discuss experimental measurement schemes of the spin susceptibility . in refs .   it has been shown that @xmath206se and @xmath207bi nmr are suitable methods to investigate the bulk of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 where the dipole hyperfine coupling dominates due to the @xmath22-orbital character of the fermi surface .",
    "similarly , @xmath208te nmr has been successfully applied to study the metallic surface states of bismuth telluride nanoparticles.@xcite we conclude that for low temperatures , nmr can also study the sc phase to determine the pairing symmetry . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : k_t](a ) and ( b ) , we find significant differences in the bulk spin response for the competing pairing symmetries.@xcite    for the knight shift , fig .",
    "[ fig : k_t](a ) , we find three different behaviors below @xmath187 .",
    "all pairing terms yield a finite value for the zero - temperature spin susceptibility because of the strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , for @xmath127 , @xmath114 , and @xmath120 we find a decrease of the knight shift below @xmath187 with a similar functional behavior for @xmath114 and @xmath127 , which differ by @xmath209 for @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath120 we observe a qualitatively similar temperature dependence but the functional form is very different as for @xmath127 and @xmath114 because of the strongly momentum dependent quasiparticle gap . in stark contrast to these reduced knight shifts ,",
    "we find no change of the knight shift for @xmath116 below @xmath187 .",
    "this also shows that a constant knight shift for @xmath210 is not a clear signature for triplet pairing symmetry and can also appear for singlet pairing symmetries .",
    "in the nmr rate , fig .",
    "[ fig : k_t](b ) , the differences between the pairing symmetries are not as strong as for the knight shift . for @xmath127 and @xmath114 , we find conventional @xmath5-wave type behavior with an activation law for @xmath177 and a sharp hebel - slichter coherence peak for @xmath211",
    ". however , we can again clearly distinguish @xmath116 and @xmath120 from @xmath127 and @xmath114 by their functional dependence .",
    "as shown above , we find a power - law @xmath188 behavior for @xmath116 due to the point nodes and for @xmath120 , the curve is compressed towards @xmath6 due to the momentum - dependent gap and shows no sharp coherence peak .",
    "hence , bulk nmr can clearly distinguish @xmath116 and @xmath120 from @xmath127 , while @xmath127 and @xmath114 are qualitatively similar . here , the main difference is that the response for @xmath114 is isotropic , whereas the @xmath127 case yields an anisotropic knight shift.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kt4 ] , a more direct way to distinguish @xmath127 and @xmath114 are the sabss for @xmath127 , which can be observed in powder samples and thin films as additional signals .",
    "the integrated intensity of the surface signal is reduced by a factor of @xmath212 compared to the bulk signal where @xmath213 is the thickness of the flakes .",
    "however , the surface signal shows a characteristic temperature behavior with decreasing spin susceptibility for @xmath167 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsc_4](c ) , the sabss yield a spatially dependent relaxation rate up to @xmath214 nm into the sample , which is a characteristic signature for the topologically non - trivial nature of the sc state . to investigate this local magnetism ,",
    "depth - resolved techniques such as @xmath3sr@xcite and @xmath215-nmr@xcite are suitable .",
    "in particular , they could differentiate the regimes with one , two , or three zero - energy sabss , which occur depending on the relative strength of the linear and quadratic terms in the hamiltonian as discussed above .",
    "for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , it has been shown that the implanted muons most probably stop in the van der waals gap between quintuple layers.@xcite despite our concentration on nmr and @xmath3sr , our results are more general and can also be applied to electron spin resonance and surface sensitive spin - flip raman scattering.@xcite    doped tis usually have sc shielding fractions of 50% while the rest is normal conducting.@xcite here , bulk nmr could detect the mechanisms , which determine this fraction . depending on @xmath3 in the normal part of the sample",
    ", there might be additional signals , which can be clearly distinguished from the sc ones by the very different temperature behavior .",
    "this key information about the distribution of dopants is an important step towards the understanding of unconventional superconductivity in tis . in this paper",
    ", we did not take vortices into account , which can be distinguished from the sabs by their temperature behavior and the different length scales .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a nmr experiment to determine the pairing symmetry of doped three - dimensional tis and to observe the mzms in the odd - parity interorbital unequal - spin pairing channel .",
    "quadratic momentum terms significantly determine the character of the different species of unconventional sabss .",
    "we have shown that the surface states of these systems have two characteristic length scales originating from the band inversion and the odd - parity pairing , and typically differ by two orders of magnitude .",
    "they contribute to a local spin susceptibility , which can be clearly distinguished from the bulk by their characteristic temperature behavior and the large local density of states .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize the usefulness of depth - controlled local probes , which directly show the existence of unconventional sabss .",
