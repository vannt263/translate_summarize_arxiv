    "gravitationally induced weak lensing effects have emerged as one of the most important probes in cosmological studies ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; albrecht et al . 2006 ; amendola et al . 2012 ; abate et al .",

    ", weak lensing peak statistics can provide important and complementary information especially considering that the structure formation is a nonlinear process ( e.g. , white et al .",

    "current observations have proved the feasibility of detecting massive clusters from weak lensing peak identifications ( e.g. , wittman et al .",
    "2006 ; gavazzi & soucail 2007 ; shan et al .",
    "future weak lensing surveys will be able to provide a large number of peaks with high signal - to - noise ratio and therefore their statistics should expectedly be able to contribute significantly to precision cosmological studies . on the other hand , it is known that many effects can affect profoundly the weak lensing peak statistics .",
    "the complex mass distribution of clusters of galaxies and the projection effects of large - scale structures along line of sights prevent us from linking weak lensing peaks to single clusters in a simple way ( e.g. , tang & fan 2005 ; yang et al . 2011 ; yang et al . 2012 ; hamana et al .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies generate large noise that not only produces false peaks through their chance alignments ( e.g. , van waerbeke 2000 ; fan 2007 ) but also affects the true peak signals from massive clusters significantly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f10 ) . furthermore , various observational effects can also have large impacts on weak lensing peak statistics if they are not taken into account properly .",
    "the full realization of the power of weak lensing analyses in future cosmological studies relies on our thorough understandings about different systematics .",
    "weak lensing observations target at far away background galaxies , and bad data occurrences are unavoidable and they should be masked out carefully ( e.g. , heymans et al . 2012 ; erben et al .",
    "these masks can occupy @xmath8 to @xmath9 of the total survey area and result irregular survey boundaries and artificial voids in the background galaxy distribution , which in turn can affect the weak lensing analyses considerably . the mask effects on the shear power spectrum estimation and on the weak lensing minkowski functionals",
    "have been investigated recently ( hikage et al .",
    "2011 ; shirasaki et al .",
    "2013 ) . considering weak lensing peak statistics ,",
    "it involves in one way or another the reconstruction of the mass distribution from the shape measurements of background galaxies .",
    "the so called shear peak statistics is based on the aperture mass map which is the smoothed convergence field with a compensated filter ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1998 ; marian et al 2012 ) .",
    "it is theoretically shown that the aperture mass at a spatial location @xmath10 can be obtained by applying a suitable filter to the tangential shear field with respect to @xmath10 ( e.g. , schneider 1996 ) .",
    "the filter to the tangential shear field can be derived from the compensated filter to the convergence field .",
    "alternatively , we can apply a filter to the full shear field ( not the tangential component ) to obtain the smoothed shear field and then from it to reconstruct the smoothed convergence field ( e.g. , van waerbeke et al .",
    "it should be noted that in this later approach , the filtering process is also applied directly to the shear field but not to the noisy convergence field reconstructed from the unsmoothed shear field .",
    "thus the devoidness of galaxies in masked regions affects inevitably the reconstructed mass map and consequently the weak lensing peak statistics . in this paper , with numerical simulations",
    ", we perform detailed studies of the mask effect on weak lensing peak statistics and the derived cosmological parameter constraints . specifically , we run sets of dark - matter - only n - body simulations and generate shear and convergence maps by ray - tracing . background galaxies with intrinsic ellipticities",
    "are randomly populated and ` observed ' ellipticities including the shear signals from simulations are then constructed for each galaxies .",
    "the masks are generated according to the mask size distribution from shan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and are given spatial positions randomly in our statistical analyses .",
    "we then remove galaxies inside the masks . to obtain the weak lensing mass distribution",
    ", we adopt the above mentioned second approach to reconstruct the smoothed convergence field from the smoothed shear field obtained from the remaining galaxies .",
    "the peak statistics is analyzed and compared with the case without masks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we introduce the lensing basics related to our studies , including the convergence reconstruction method . in  3 , we describe the simulations and the ray - tracing method .",
    "the generation of the ` observed galaxy ellipticities ' and the reconstruction of the convergence field from them without and with masks are presented . in  4 , the theoretical model of f10 used in our peak statistical analyses is given , and its applicability is studied by comparing with the results from simulations . ",
    "5 contains the main results of our analyses of the mask effects on weak lensing peak statistics .",
    "summary and discussions are given in  6 .",
    "observationally , the weak lensing effect is mostly extracted from the shape distortion measurements of background galaxies , which is directly related to the weak lensing shear components . on the other hand , for weak lensing peak statistics ,",
    "it targets at high peaks in the large - scale mass distribution , and therefore is more directly linked to the lensing convergence which is the weighted projection of the density distribution along the line of sight .",
    "the convergence and the shear are not independent quantities and all determined by the lensing potential .",
    "thus we can derive the mass distribution from the observed shape measurements as described in the following .",
    "considering small source galaxies , their linear - order image distortion from the gravitational lensing effect of a single lens can be described by the jacobian matrix given by ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lensing convergence and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two shear components with @xmath15 the lensing potential @xmath16 is determined by the surface mass density of the lens through @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the critical surface mass density given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens , to the source , and between the lens and the source .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath22 . for weak lensing effects from large - scale structures beyond a single lens , under the born approximation",
    "the above formulations still hold except the lensing convergence is given by , in the case of a fixed source position ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) , @xmath23}{a(w ' ) } , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the comoving radial distance , @xmath25 is the comoving angular diameter distance , @xmath26 is the scale factor of the universe , and @xmath27 is the density perturbation along the line of sight .",
    "the image distortion is then described by @xmath12 and @xmath28 with the quantity @xmath29^{-1}$ ] giving rise to the flux magnification ( @xmath30 ) , and the eigen values of @xmath31 related to the axial length .",
    "specifically , the lensing effect makes a circular source appear as an ellipse with the axial ratio of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is named as the reduced shear component .",
    "thus for ideally circular sources , we can obtain @xmath34 by accurately measuring the shape of the sources , and further reconstruct the convergence @xmath12 from the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath35 , which in the fourier space can be written as ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is given by @xmath38    however , galaxies have intrinsic ellipticities .",
    "the complex ellipticity of the lensing distorted image @xmath39 with @xmath40 is then related to the intrinsic ones @xmath41 by the following relation ( e.g. , seitz & schneider 1997 ) @xmath42 where ` * ' represents the complex conjugation .",
    "it has been shown that the average of @xmath43 gives rise to the unbiased estimate of @xmath34 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ( seitz & schneider 1997 ) . in the case of @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ", we have @xmath49 .    eq.([rk ] ) and ( [ dl ] ) show that theoretically we can obtain the mass distribution which is related to the convergence field from the observed @xmath50 .",
    "the aperture mass peak statistics is based on the quantity @xmath51 , where the function @xmath52 is a compensated filter satisfying @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . from the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath56 ,",
    "it is shown that @xmath57 can be obtained directly from the tangential component of the shear with @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the tangential shear component at @xmath60 with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "the filter function @xmath62 can be derived from @xmath52 with @xmath63 ( e.g. , schneider 1996 ) .",
    "therefore if the approximation @xmath64 is valid , one can directly obtain @xmath57 from the tangential component of the observed ellipticities @xmath65 . for peak analyses , we are interested in high peaks which are related to massive halos . in those regions",
    ", @xmath49 is not a good approximation and thus @xmath57 obtained from @xmath65 with the filter function @xmath62 is not exactly equivalent to @xmath57 defined through the convergence @xmath12 with the filter function @xmath52 .",
    "thus there can have some complications if one wants to theoretically link @xmath57 from observations to the properties of @xmath12 due to the nonlinear relation between @xmath66 and @xmath56 .",
    "another approach to derive the mass distribution from the observed ellipticities @xmath67 is to first obtain the smoothed field of the full @xmath50 , and then go through the nonlinear reconstruction process to get the smoothed convergence field @xmath12 ( e.g. , van waebeke 2013 ) .",
    "this is the approach we adopt in this paper .",
    "it is noted that the smoothing / filtering here is still applied directly to the observed ellipticities . from eq.([eobs ] ) , we can construct the distortion @xmath68 by ( e.g. , schneider & seitz 1995 ) @xmath69 as the observed quantity , which is independent of @xmath45 or @xmath70 .",
    "one can then solve for @xmath71 by @xmath72 , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] where the sign is determined by @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "we proceed the reconstruction of the lensing convergence iteratively from the following relation @xmath74 \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 .",
    "specifically , we start by assuming @xmath76 and @xmath77 everywhere , and thus ( e.g. , bartelmann 1995 ) @xmath78 at @xmath79-th step , we obtain @xmath80 from @xmath81 via eq.(12 ) and further calculate @xmath82 from @xmath80 to determine the sign of @xmath83 everywhere . at @xmath84 step ,",
    "we insert @xmath80 into eq . ( 11 ) to estimate @xmath85 by considering the signs of @xmath86 calculated in step @xmath87 .    in the case of @xmath47 and @xmath88",
    ", we have @xmath89 , and thus the convergence reconstruction is a single - step linear process .",
    "to study the mask effects on weak lensing peak statistics and the corresponding cosmological parameter constraints derived from the peak analyses , we carry out sets of dark - matter - only n - body simulations in the flat @xmath90cdm framework .",
    "the fiducial model is taken to be @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 are the present dimensionless total matter density , energy density from the cosmological constant , baryonic matter density and the hubble constant in units of @xmath101 , respectively . the parameter @xmath102 is the power index for the initial density perturbations and @xmath103 is the root - mean - square of the linear density perturbations extrapolated to present with the top - hat smoothing scale of @xmath104 . in order to test the applicability of our theoretical model for weak lensing peak statistics ( f10 ) , we also run four sets of simulations with different @xmath105 and @xmath103 near the fiducial ones .",
    "the detailed cosmological parameters for the simulations are listed in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the conventional ray tracing algorithm is adopted to calculate the deflection of light rays and the corresponding shear and convergence maps .",
    ".cosmology parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                                 we also explore ways to improve our theoretical modeling to take into account the mask effects properly . from fig .",
    "[ fig : largeinfluence ] , we see that the significantly affected peaks are closely associated with masked regions , especially those of large masks .",
    "therefore for theoretical modeling , we need to treat these masked regions separately from the rest part of the survey area . for our peak abundance analyses ,",
    "the presence of masks mainly affects the number of galaxies that are usable in obtaining the smoothed ellipticity field @xmath50 around the masked regions .",
    "this in turn leads to non - uniform noises in the convergence field reconstructed from @xmath50 with higher noises near masks than that for the area away from them .",
    "these higher noises affect the peak counts in regions around masks in two ways .",
    "one is that the systematic peak height shift for true peaks is larger in these regions ( f10 ) .",
    "the other is the enhancement of the number of noise peaks given their peak heights measured in signal - to - noise ratio with @xmath106 still taken to be @xmath107 , the value in the mask - free case .",
    "the latter can be understood by noting that for different two - dimensional gaussian random fields , their peak number density distributions are the same if the peak heights in each field are measured in the signal - to - noise ratio defined with the noise level @xmath106 of the field itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". thus if we use a fixed @xmath106 to define the signal - to - noise ratio for peaks in different gaussian random fields , the peak number distribution would be different for different gaussian random field . here due to the presence of masks , the true noise levels around the masks are higher .",
    "when counting peaks , however , we use the fixed value @xmath108 ( corresponding to @xmath109 ) uniformly to define their signal - to - noise ratios . therefore the number density of peaks with high @xmath110 ( @xmath108 ) is higher than that of the mask - free case .    for further quantitative analyses of the non - uniform noise",
    ", we calculate the contribution of source galaxies to each grid point in constructing the smoothed field of @xmath50 by    @xmath111    where the summation is over all galaxies with @xmath112 for galaxies outside masks and @xmath113 for galaxies inside masks .",
    "the kernel @xmath114 is taken to be the gaussian smoothing function with @xmath115 consistently .",
    "the effective number density of source galaxies at each grid point is then estimated by @xmath116 , where @xmath109 here .",
    "we find that @xmath117 can be significantly smaller than @xmath118 in large mask regions .",
    "considering the fact that the noise can not be suitably modeled as a gaussian random field in regions with @xmath119 , we exclude the circular masked regions with the mask radius larger than @xmath7 from our peak counting analyses .",
    "we name these regions as part i regions which on average occupy about @xmath120 over the total @xmath121 survey area in our studies . for the remaining @xmath122 area",
    ", we develop a two - noise - level model to include the non - uniform noise in our theoretical considerations .",
    "specifically , for each of the @xmath123 reconstructed convergence maps , we first exclude part i regions .",
    "we then divide the remaining area of each map further into two parts , with part ii being the left over spiked mask regions around the excluded circular regions of part i , and part iii for the rest of the area .",
    "we then calculate the effective number density of source galaxies for part ii and part iii separately by averaging @xmath124 over the grid points inside the corresponding regions and over all the @xmath123 maps . for part",
    "ii , we obtain @xmath125 , considerably smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "for part iii , @xmath126 which is close to @xmath127 as expected .            with @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we calculate the expected number density of peaks with the model of f10 separately for part ii and part iii regions .",
    "we then rescale the signal - to - noise ratios of the peaks in the two regions by a uniform noise level @xmath108 , the value used in counting peaks from simulated maps , to obtain the rescaled number density of peaks @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the average areas of the two regions @xmath132 and @xmath133 over a map are computed from the @xmath123 reconstructed maps with masks by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the area of part ii in map @xmath136 , and similarly for @xmath133 .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the total number of peaks in each s / n bin ( with @xmath108 ) over a map is then calculated by @xmath137 .",
    "these theoretical predictions are then compared with the corresponding mean ` observed ' numbers of peaks obtained by averaging over the @xmath123 counted numbers of peaks directly from the reconstructed convergence maps with masks after the exclusion of part i regions .",
    "we note that in this treatment , the effective usable area over a map @xmath138 , in comparison with @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the pure rejection analyses with the rejection areas of @xmath141 times and @xmath142 times of the mask size around each mask , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rejection ] . )",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] with the left panel for the peak counts and the right panel for the fitting results from our two - noise - level model .",
    "the blue , and red histograms in the left panel correspond to the results from the reconstructed convergence maps with masks excluding part i regions , and the theoretical prediction from the two - noise - level model , respectively , where the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath143 in the horizontal axis is defined with @xmath108 .",
    "it is seen that the theoretical predictions agree well with the simulation results .",
    "the right panel presents the corresponding constraint for @xmath5 .",
    "comparing to the result shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : maskfitting ] , we see that our treatment here works well and improves the fitting dramatically with a much reduced bias .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the mask effects on weak lensing convergence peak statistics and the consequent cosmological parameter constraints from weak lensing peak counts .",
    "we run large sets of ray - tracing simulations to generate base convergence and shear maps assuming the source redshift @xmath144 . by randomly populating source galaxies with intrinsic ellipticities ,",
    "we perform convergence reconstruction from @xmath50 , the smoothed field of the ` observed ' ellipticities of source galaxies , for cases without and with masks , respectively .",
    "the mask size distribution from @xcite is adopted .",
    "we then investigate in detail the mask effects on weak - lensing peak counts by comparing the results from the two cases .",
    "their influences on cosmological parameter constraints derived from peak abundances are further studied using the peak model of f10 including the noise effects .",
    "the validity of this model in terms of the cosmological dependence of peak abundances are tested with simulations .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the occurrence of masked regions reduces the number of usable source galaxies and therefore increases the noise in the regions around masks .",
    "this in turn leads to systematic increases of the number of high peaks and consequently a significant bias in cosmological parameters constrained from weak lensing peak counts .",
    "the larger the masked area fraction is , the larger the effects are .",
    "\\(2 ) we find that the strongly affected region around a mask is about @xmath145 times of the mask size .",
    "excluding such regions in peak counting can eliminate largely the mask effects and therefore reduce the bias in cosmological parameter constraints significantly ( 3 ) we develop a two - noise - level model that treats the mask affected regions separately . this model can account for the mask effects on weak lensing peak counts very well except for very large masked regions with radius larger than @xmath7 where the noise can not be suitably modeled as a gaussian random field .",
    "these very large masks need to be excluded in peak analyses .",
    "then the constraints on cosmological parameters based on the two - noise - level model improve dramatically comparing to the large bias from the model with a uniform noise .    in our analyses ,",
    "we apply the kaiser - squires method for the nonlinear convergence reconstruction with a gaussian filter . for the maximum - likelihood reconstruction method @xcite",
    ", we expect that the mask effects on the reconstructed convergence field and the peak counts are qualitatively similar to the results shown in this paper although quantitative studies are still needed",
    ". for other methods , such as the multi - scale entropy restoration filtering , namely mrlens @xcite , the mask effects can be different and detailed analyses should be carried out when a specific reconstruction method is used .",
    "it is also noted that while qualitatively similar mask effects on peak abundances are expected , different filter functions used in the convergence reconstruction and different peak binning methods used in the analyses can lead to quantitatively different results .",
    "the model of f10 and the improved two - noise - level model for the mask effects contain only the noise effects without including the projection effects of large - scale structures and the complex mass distribution of dark matter halos . while the noise from intrinsic ellipticities is the dominant source of errors in weak - lensing peak analyses and our results",
    "show that the model(s ) can indeed give rise to very good descriptions of the peak counts , future large surveys aiming at high precision cosmological studies need more accurate modeling of the peak counts theoretically",
    ". we will explore further improvements of the model carefully in our future studies .",
