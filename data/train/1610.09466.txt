    "the effective method for investigation of phase transitions in statistical mechanics is to study the distribution of zeros of the grand partition function which is considered as a function of a complex magnetic field . in 1952 ,",
    "lee and yang , in their famous papers ( see @xcite ) , proved _ the circle theorem _ which states that the zeros of the grand partition function of ising ferromagnet lie on the unit circle in the complex magnetic plane ( _ lee  yang zeros _ ) .",
    "they proposed a mechanism for the occurrence of phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit and showed that the distribution of the zeros of a model determines its critical behavior . in 1964 ,",
    "fisher , in his paper @xcite , initiated the study of partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane ( _ fisher zeros _ ) .",
    "these methods are then extended to other type of interactions and found a wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "the density of lee  yang zeros of the grand partition function of the ising model can be determined experimentally from the field dependence of the isothermal magnetization data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the fractal structure of fisher zeros in @xmath1state potts model ( which is a multi - state generalization of the ising model ) on the diamond lattice was obtained by derrida , de seze and itzykson @xcite .",
    "they showed that the fisher zeros in hierarchical lattice models are just the julia set corresponding to the renormalization group transformation .",
    "bosco and goulard rosa @xcite ( see also @xcite ) calculated the fractal dimension of the julia set associated with the lee ",
    "yang zeros of the ferromagnetic ising model on the cayley tree . by means of the dynamical system approach , monroe , in series of papers @xcite , studied the julia set , the period doubling cascades , and the chaos behavior of the potts - bethe mapping associated with the @xmath1state potts model on the bethe lattice ( the cayley tree ) .",
    "the @xmath0adic counterpart of the theory of gibbs measures on cayley trees has been also initiated in the papers @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath0adic gibbs measures as well as the phase transition for some @xmath0adic lattice models were established in @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , all translation - invariant @xmath0adic gibbs measures of the @xmath0adic potts model on the cayley tree of order two and three were described by studying allocation of roots of quadratic and cubic equations over some domains of the @xmath0adic fields . however , in the @xmath0adic case , due to lack of the convex structure of the set of @xmath0adic ( quasi ) gibbs measures , it was quite difficult to constitute a phase transition with some features of the set of @xmath0adic ( quasi ) gibbs measures .",
    "the rigorous mathematical foundation of the theory of gibbs measures on cayley trees was presented in the book @xcite ( for survey see @xcite ) .    unlike the real case @xcite , the set of @xmath0adic gibbs measures of @xmath0adic lattice models on the cayley tree has a complex structure in a sense that it is strongly tied up with a diophantine problem over the @xmath0adic numbers fields .",
    "the rise of the order of the cayley tree makes difficult to study the corresponding diophantine problem over the @xmath0adic numbers fields . in general , because of different topological structures , the same diophantine problem may have different solutions from the field of @xmath0adic numbers to the field of real numbers .",
    "the most frequently asked question is whether a root of a polynomial equation belongs to domains @xmath4 or not . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the little attention was given to this problem in the literature .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we first recall some basic concepts and notions in @xmath0adic statistical mechanics . in section 3 , we show that the description of all translation invariant @xmath0adic gibbs measures can lead to the investigation of fixed points of the potts - bethe mapping in some domains of @xmath7 . finally ,",
