    "in recent years topological defects @xcite in asymptotic de sitter ( ds)/ anti- de sitter ( ads ) space - time have gained renewed interest .",
    "this is mainly due to the proposed ds / cft @xcite , resp .",
    "ads / cft @xcite correspondences .",
    "these correspondences suggest a holographic duality between gravity in a @xmath0-dimensional ds , resp .",
    "ads space and a conformal field theory ( cft ) `` living '' on the boundary of the ds , resp .",
    "ads spacetime and thus being @xmath1-dimensional .",
    "however , ds space - time is also interesting from a cosmological point of view since it seems to be confirmed by observational data @xcite that we live in a universe with positive cosmological constant .",
    "gravitating global monopoles in asymptotically flat space - time were first discussed in @xcite .",
    "these topological defects were found to have a negative mass and a deficit angle depending on the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar goldstone field and the gravitational coupling . for sufficiently high enough values of the vev",
    "the solutions have an horizon @xcite .",
    "these solutions were named ( after their string counterparts @xcite ) `` supermassive monopoles '' .    in @xcite , it was found that the introduction of a cosmological constant can render the mass of the monopole positive .",
    "this was demonstrated by a figure showing the mass function as function of the radial coordinate for different choices of the cosmological constant . in our recent work ,",
    "we are mainly interested in composite monopole defects @xcite in ds/ ads space - time @xcite .",
    "this is why we cross - checked the results of @xcite and found discrepancies between our results and those in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we give the model in section ii and discuss the asymptotic behaviour , which should be compared to that in @xcite , in section iii .",
    "we give our numerical results in section iv and conclude in section v.",
    "we consider the following action  : @xmath2 which describes a goldstone triplet @xmath3 , @xmath4 , interacting with gravity in an asymptotically de sitter ( ds ) ( for the cosmological constant @xmath5 ) , resp .",
    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) ( @xmath6 ) space - time . @xmath7 is newton s constant , @xmath8 is the self - coupling constant of the goldstone field and @xmath9 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the goldstone field .",
    "for the metric , the spherically symmetric ansatz in schwarzschild - like coordinates reads  : @xmath10 while for the goldstone field , we choose the hedgehog ansatz @xcite  : @xmath11 we introduce the following dimensionless variable and coupling constants  : @xmath12    varying ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric fields gives the einstein equations which can be combined to give two first order differential equations for @xmath13 and @xmath14 :   @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath14 are related as follows :   @xmath18 note that for @xmath19 , the existence of solutions without horizon is restricted by @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "variation with respect to the matter fields yields the euler - lagrange equations for the goldstone field  : @xmath21 the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "note that the equations have the same structure as for the asymptotically flat space - time @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant just appears in the relation defining @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in order to solve the system of equations uniquely",
    ", we have to introduce @xmath25 boundary conditions , which we choose to be  : @xmath26    the dimensionless mass of the solution is determined by the asymptotic value @xmath27 of the function @xmath23 and is given by @xmath28 .",
    "expanding the functions around the origin gives  : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters to be determined numerically .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour ( @xmath32 ) is given by  : @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 it is worthwhile to contrast the coefficient of the @xmath36 correction for the mass function @xmath23 appearing in the above equation ( [ muinfty ] ) with its counterpart in @xcite , eq.(18 ) . while in the latter",
    "the coefficient is independent on both the cosmological constant and the self - coupling of the goldstone field , we find here a non - trivial dependence on these parameters ( which is indeed confirmed by our numerical analysis ) .",
    "we also remark that the expansion presented in @xcite is in contradiction with the figure presented in that paper .",
    "the figure of @xcite seems incompatible with the fact that the first asymptotic correction to the mass is supposed to be independent of the cosmological constant .",
    "we remark that without loosing generality , we can choose @xmath37 .",
    "this limit was studied previously in great detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was found that for @xmath19 global monopoles have a negative mass @xcite .",
    "thus , the global monopole has a repulsive effect on a test particle in its neighbourhood .",
    "further , it was shown @xcite that global monopoles without horizon only exist for @xmath20 , while for @xmath38 no static solutions exist at all . the configurations for @xmath39",
    "were called `` supermassive '' monopoles .",
    "we have redone the calculations and found perfect agreement with the results in @xcite .",
    "especially , we remark in view of fig .  1 that for @xmath19 , the mass of the solution is close to @xmath40 .",
    "since the mass of the global monopole in flat space is just @xmath41 @xcite ( of course in rescaled units in comparison to here ) , the value of @xmath42 is in good agreement with these results .",
    "we found in addition that the mass function at large @xmath22 is always negative and becomes more and more negative for increasing @xmath43 @xcite .      by solving the three equations numerically we constructed solutions for negative values of @xmath44 .",
    "first , we checked whether the asymptotic behaviour found in ( [ ainfty ] ) is correct .",
    "we indeed confirmed numerically that the coefficients have the given dependence on the coupling constants    following the investigation in @xcite , we have then studied the dependence of the mass @xmath28 on the cosmological constant @xmath44 for a fixed value of @xmath43 . as is demonstrated in fig .  1 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we find that the mass increases , but stays negative for * all * values of the cosmological constant .",
    "in fact , as is evident from fig .  1 , the mass decreases further with the increase of @xmath43 for a fixed @xmath44 . in the limit @xmath47",
    ", the mass tends to zero .",
    "we contrast the behaviour of the mass - function @xmath23 for different values of @xmath44 with that in fig.1 of @xcite .",
    "since the authors choose the vev of the goldstone field to be @xmath48 , while we choose it to be @xmath49 , the values of the negative valued cosmological constant in their plot corresponds to choosing @xmath50 , @xmath51 here .",
    "moreover , their choice of @xmath7 leads to @xmath52 . in fig .  2 ,",
    "we show the profile of the mass function @xmath23 for this choice of parameters .",
    "clearly , the mass function is negative for all @xmath22 .",
    "of course , we have to add that we have integrated the equations only up to some maximal value of @xmath53 .",
    "however , as can been seen for the asymptotic expansion ( [ muinfty ] ) , the derivative of @xmath23 at large @xmath22 is always negative and thus the function continues to decrease . because of that , local minima or even zeros of the function @xmath23 in the asymptotic region are excluded .",
    "fixing @xmath44 and varying @xmath43 , we observe a phenomenon not previously discussed in the literature .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  3 for @xmath54 .",
    "increasing @xmath43 , we observe that a horizon starts to form and at @xmath55 , the solution has a degenerate horizon at @xmath56 .",
    "thus ads monopoles without horizon only exist for @xmath57 .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath58 depends on @xmath44 and that it is increasing with the decrease of @xmath44 .",
    "e.g. we find that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that the solution outside the horizon can * not * be completely described by a ads solution of the form : @xmath61 where @xmath28 is the mass of the solution .",
    "the reason is that @xmath62 is not a solution of ( [ feq ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath63 is close to @xmath49 for @xmath64 and thus ( [ ads ] ) can be thought of as an approximation . the solution ( [ ads ] ) has a degenerate horizon at @xmath65 with corresponding mass @xmath66 . for the values of the parameters given in fig .  3 ( especially @xmath67 ) , we find that @xmath68 and @xmath69 . from our numerical analysis ,",
    "we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    finally , to study the appearance of horizons in this model in more detail , we have fixed @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , and studied the dependence of the value of the zero of @xmath24 , @xmath74 with @xmath75 in dependence on @xmath44 .",
    "we have chosen these two values of @xmath43 because only for @xmath76 do horizons appear in the asymptotically flat case @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . clearly , for @xmath78 and @xmath79 no horizons appear which confirms the results of @xcite , while for @xmath80 and @xmath79 we find horizons .",
    "in fact , for a specific range of @xmath81 two horizons exist . for @xmath80",
    ", we find that this is for @xmath82 . at @xmath83",
    "the two horizons join and form a degenerate horizon of type shown in fig .  3 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath84 which is in good agreement with the previously presented results . in the limit @xmath85",
    ", the outer horizon tends to infinity , while the inner horizon tends to the one of the `` supermassive '' monopoles observed previously @xcite .      in @xcite",
    "the question was addressed whether the mass of the global monopole can become positive for specific choices of the cosmological constant .",
    "it was found that for positive cosmological constants this is possible . as a check for a future publication @xcite on composite monopole defects in ds / ads space - time ,",
    "we have tried to obtain the results given in @xcite and found contradictions .",
    "choosing @xmath44 positive a cosmological horizon appears at @xmath86 in ds space .",
    "we find that @xmath87 is a decreasing function of the cosmological constant . for increasing @xmath44",
    ", the value of @xmath88 tends to zero as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "we find further that @xmath89 for all @xmath90 .",
    "since the mass curve does only alter its shape very little when choosing different @xmath43 , we conclude that in contrast to what is claimed in @xcite , the appearance of a cosmological constant ( of either sign ) can * not * alter the sign of the mass of the global monopole .",
    "rather , we find that the mass gets more negative for increasing @xmath90 which can be related to the fact that the core of the monopole increases due to increased cosmological expansion .    in fig .  2",
    ", we present the mass function for @xmath52 and @xmath91 .",
    "this should be compared to the fig.1 in @xcite .",
    "first , we remark that we are surprised that the authors of @xcite have managed to find solutions which correspond to our @xmath92 .",
    "we find that increasing @xmath44 from zero to positive values , we can construct solutions only for @xmath93 .",
    "the reason is that with increasing cosmological constant the horizon which appears for the ds solutions decreases to lie closer and closer to the core of the monopole .",
    "clearly , the mass function @xmath23 is a constantly decreasing function of the coordinate @xmath22 and does nt have local extrema like in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic values of @xmath23 are always negative .",
    "topological defects @xcite are believed to be relevant for structure formation in the universe .",
    "global defects , i.e. defects which do nt involve gauge fields are of special interest in this context since they have a long - range scalar field .",
    "this leads to the infiniteness of energy in flat space , but however renders a strong gravitational effect when the topological defects are studied in curved space .",
    "moreover , in the case of the global monopole , the coupling to gravity can remove the singularity present in flat space .",
    "the space - time then has a deficit angle and is not locally flat .",
    "moreover , the mass of the monopole is negative , which was interpreted as a repulsive effect of the monopole .",
    "while for positive cosmological constant ( ds space ) a horizon , the so - called `` cosmological horizon '' always appears independent on the gravitational coupling @xmath43 , the existence of horizons in ads space depends strongly on the values of the cosmological and gravitational constants . for vanishing cosmological constant @xmath19 ,",
    "it was found previously that horizons exist only for @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath81 a monotonically decreasing curve in the @xmath44-@xmath43-plane appears which represents the solutions with one , degenerate horizon . above this curve , solutions with two horizons",
    "exist , while below the solutions have no horizons at all .",
    "the authors of @xcite have studied global monopoles in a ds / ads space - time and found that the inclusion of the cosmological constant can render the mass of the monopole positive .",
    "reconsidering these solutions with a highly accurate numerical routine ( see @xcite for a short description ) and studying the asymptotic behaviour we come to a different conclusion  : global monopoles do * not * acquire a positive mass in ads or ds space - time .",
