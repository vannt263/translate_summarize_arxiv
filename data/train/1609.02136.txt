    "hence , particularly the higher order cumulants characterize the peculiarities of the clones .",
    "the third and fourth cumulant are associated with the skewness and the tailedness ( kurtosis ) of the distributions .",
    "let us first discuss the cumulants along the _ x_-quadrature .",
    "the curve of the mean value @xmath98 is slightly convex , i.e the mean field amplitude of the clones approaches the coherent amplitude of the input signal from below .",
    "the variance is slightly above the heisenberg minimum uncertainty , which in our convention is set @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , we observe a negative skewness @xmath100 , i.e. the distribution is leaning to the right .",
    "this can intuitively be understood by considering that the cloner needs to _ decide _ between the bcs .",
    "imperfections in the cloning procedure of @xmath87 results in an erroneous preparation in favor of the state @xmath37 hence shifting the barycenter of the distribution towards the left while the peak remains around @xmath87 .    along the _ p_-quadrature only even - valued cumulants contribute to the distribution .",
    "the complete information about the signal state is encoded along the _ x_-quadrature such that one could naively expect that a cloner that only interacts with the input state by partial measurements , coherent displacements and squeezing would essentially disturb the marginal distribution along this quadrature while preserving the gaussian statistics along the _ p_-quadrature .",

    "a schematic overview on the different approaches is depicted in fig.[cloningschemes ] .",
    "the simplest approach to generate two copies of an unknown coherent state is to split the signal on a symmetric beam splitter , see fig.[cloningschemes]a ) .",
    "the coherent amplitude reduces as @xmath106 , but the phase and the ( quantum ) noise characteristics are perfectly preserved . while obviously inadequate for bright signals , this approach is astoundingly effective in the domain of weak signals @xmath107 .",
    "the difference in the states amplitude prior to and after the beam splitter is @xmath108 , i.e. proportional to @xmath109 . for small amplitudes ,",
    "the absolute difference in the amplitudes is small and hence the cloning fidelity is high . the maximal fidelity for the pure beam splitting approach is shown as the dark blue curve in fig.[cloningfidelity ] .",
    "another intuitive approach to generate copies of an unknown input state is to amplify the signal to twice its initial intensity followed by symmetric beam splitting .",
    "conventional optical amplifiers are optimized for an unbiased processing of arbitrary signals , which requires operation in a linear and phase - insensitive way .",
    "the conservation of the canonical commutator bracket imposes an inevitable noise penalty to the output of such amplifiers @xcite . in the high gain regime",
    "this results in a minimal reduction of the signal - to - noise ratio by a factor of two . for bcs ,",
    "a remedy is offered by parametric processes , in particular by the squeezing operation that is described by the squeezing operator @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the complex squeezing parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath105 controls the degree of squeezing and the phase @xmath112 defines the squeezed field quadrature in phase space .",
    "a sketch of the cloner based on squeezing and subsequent beam splitting is shown in fig.[cloningschemes]b ) .",
    "the squeezing operation is a phase - sensitive amplification ( psa ) and effects a hyperbolic transformation of the quadrature variables such that the mean amplitude and the quadrature variances of the bcs transform as @xmath113 the amplified quadrature can be aligned perfectly with the coherent states modulation quadrature ( cp .",
    "fig.[fullbcs - phasespace]d ) ) such that clones with the exact input amplitude could straightforwardly be generated .",
    "the resulting fidelity , however , is limited by the squeezing induced redistribution of the heisenberg uncertainties .",
    "optimization of the output fidelity thus requires to balance the trade - off between the amplification of the amplitude and the associated deviations in the quadrature variances . as a consequence ,",
    "the optimally amplified amplitude is slightly smaller than that of the input state .",
    "the maximal fidelity for this approach is shown as the orange curve in fig.[cloningfidelity ] . for signal",
    "mean photon numbers up to @xmath114 the fidelity provided by the psa based cloner asymptotically coincides with the quantum optimal fidelity .      within the framework of classical physics an arbitrary number of perfect copies of an unknown state",
    "can be generated by precise measurement and subsequent preparation . in the realm of quantum mechanics ,",
    "this approach is baffled by the complementarity of different observables and the potential non - orthogonality of the states in question . for bcs",
    "the maximal fidelity of the measure&prepare approach is first and foremost determined by the minimal error probability in discriminating the states , i.e. the helstrom bound , see eq.([eq : helstrombound ] ) .",

    "prior to the partial measurement , the second input port of the beam splitter was implicitly assumed to be in the vacuum state .",
    "however , the error probability in the discrimination of bcs can be reduced by squeezing the vacuum input in the _ x_-quadrature .",

    "second , the hyperbolic phase space transformation invoked by the psa reshapes the heisenberg uncertainty to withdraw the remaining squeezing from the squeezed vacuum input . note , however , that it is not possible to regenerate a pure coherent state , as the transmitted part of the signal is already in a mixed state due to the beam splitting of the squeezed vacuum . by optimizing over the transmissivity of the beam splitter , the squeezing parameters , and the coherent displacement we find the fidelities presented as the light blue curve in fig.[cloningfidelity ] .",

    "the resulting fidelity can be further increased by taking squeezed states into account . in this case , squeezed vacuum ( where the squeezing is in the quadrature orthogonal to the signal states coherent excitation ) maximizes the fidelity up to a critical mean photon number of about @xmath143 . at this power ,",
