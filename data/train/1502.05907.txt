    "while the naturalness problem has been a dominant paradigm for model building beyond the standard model of particle physics , the triviality problem of the higgs sector conceptually appears much more severe as it inhibits a constructive ultraviolet ( uv)-complete definition of the standard model as an interacting quantum field theory .",
    "the triviality of the standard model higgs sector is expected to arise from the fundamental scalar degrees of freedom . for pure scalar theories , strong evidence for triviality @xcite",
    " the fact that the continuum limit can only be taken for the noninteracting theory  has been accumulated by lattice simulations in @xmath0 @xcite and analytic methods @xcite ( see @xcite for a rigorous proof in @xmath1 ) . for nonabelian higgs models , monte - carlo methods @xcite have found no indication for continuous phase transitions facilitating a nontrivial continuum limit . in practice ,",
    "triviality arguments have been used to put upper bounds on the higgs mass @xcite long before its discovery .    since atlas and cms have found a comparatively light scalar boson @xcite , the standard model appears to be in a `` near - critical '' regime @xcite indicating that the higgs self - interaction is small near the planck scale .",
    "this would be natural if all standard - model interactions including the scalar self - interaction were asymptotically free ( af ) @xcite .",
    "this is , however , not the case from the standard viewpoint of perturbative @xmath2 functions .",
    "the construction of af yang - mills - higgs(-yukawa ) systems is in principle straightforward on the basis of a perturbative analysis @xcite .",
    "in particular , the problematic quartic scalar interaction @xmath3 , can be marginal - relevant ( uv stable ) or -irrelevant ( uv unstable ) , depending on the model and the choice of trajectories .",
    "uv - complete trajectories which emanate from the gauian fixed point ( fp ) can also be built by fixing the unstable marginal - irrelevant direction . in rg - improved perturbation theory ,",
    "this scenario requires additional fermions as well as eigenvalue conditions @xcite to be satisfied @xcite .",
    "this implies a _ reduction of couplings _",
    "@xcite , here effectively removing one parameter , as @xmath3 is then purely induced , implying a prediction of the higgs - to-@xmath4-boson mass ratio . to our knowledge none of such theories",
    "comes sufficiently close to the standard model .",
    "alternatively , uv completion in higgs models can be achieved via asymptotic safety , which also requires dynamical fermions @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we consider the construction of af yang - mills - higgs systems from a new viewpoint .",
    "our central idea is that , in order for suitable af nonabelian higgs models to exist , the scalar potential needs to approach absolute flatness concurrently with the vanishing gauge coupling @xmath5 .",
    "this permits large amplitude fluctuations of the scalar field controlled by the latter parameter .",
    "we thus suggest to consider gauge - rescaled scalar field variables @xmath6 , with some power @xmath7 , as the relevant measure for amplitudes . while @xmath7 at this point merely seems to be an unphysical rescaling parameter",
    ", we show that it parametrizes rg - scale - dependent boundary conditions for the effective potential .",
    "these in turn are equivalent to @xmath5-dependent renormalization and boundary conditions for the correlation functions of the theory . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath7 parametrizes a set of physically distinct rg flows , each one possessing a gauian fp and allowing for af trajectories .",
    "first signatures of such a trajectory have been found in a gauged yukawa model in @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we explore the general pattern to construct uv - complete trajectories for af nonabelian higgs models , including the physically relevant su(2 ) model , for the first time .",
    "let us start by recalling the standard perturbative analysis of a nonabelian higgs model , as presented , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop @xmath2-functions derived under the standard assumption of working in the _ deep euclidean region _ , where the rg scale @xmath8 is much larger than any other mass scale , read @xmath9 the integrated flow in this simple truncation yields @xmath10\\right\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is an integration constant . for the su(2 )",
    "model , @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is negative and the flow in eq .   has a branch cut , the position of which depends on @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "this is the so - called landau pole , indicating the unbounded increase of @xmath3 towards the uv and thus the failure of perturbation theory .",
    "this is considered as reflecting the triviality problem of the theory which is assumed to persist also beyond perturbation theory .",
    "if @xmath15 were positive , @xmath3 would simply be proportional to @xmath16 itself for sufficiently small @xmath16 with a @xmath13-independent proportionality constant . in the limit @xmath17",
    ", two special trajectories would appear , corresponding to solutions of the fp equation for the ratio @xmath18  @xcite @xmath19 and they would describe the possible uv asymptotics of all af trajectories .",
    "conversely , if at least one of these roots is positive , then there are af trajectories in the positive @xmath20 plane .",
    "nonabelian higgs models with this property have been classified , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the standard su(2 ) model is not of this type .    in order to explore possible loop holes of this conventional perturbative argument",
    ", let us study more general potentials of the form @xmath21 this includes a possible vacuum expectation value @xmath22 and higher - order operators such as @xmath23 which can be used to effectively resum higher loop contributions .",
    "a nonperturbative way to study the flow of general potentials will be used below . here , we simply study the contribution of @xmath23 to the flow of @xmath3 . expressed in terms of @xmath24 ,",

    "if realized , this implies that @xmath3 and @xmath23 ( and possibly all higher @xmath30 ) are asymptotically free together with the gauge coupling @xmath16 .",
    "perturbatively , it might seem difficult to stabilize @xmath23 in this way .",
    "however , there is an effect which is missed by the conventional perturbative analysis : to see this , let us study the flow of the minimum @xmath22 of the potential ( ignoring wave function renormalizations for the moment ) , @xmath31 for any positive @xmath24 , the ratio @xmath32 is attracted to a positive uv fixed point .",
    "this implies that @xmath29 can be attracted towards a uv fixed point potential in the regime of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , such that the minimum increases proportional to the rg scale , @xmath33 .",
    "this conclusion has a dramatic consequence : the standard assumption that the uv behavior of the theory can be exhaustively analyzed in the deep euclidean region with @xmath34 any other scale can be violated . in order to explore the implications",

    "we analyze the rg flow not only restricted to the set of perturbatively renormalizable operators , but include a full scalar potential . even if the higher operators turn out to be irrelevant and strongly suppressed along af trajectories , it is crucial for the uv construction of these trajectories to go beyond the single - coupling analysis .",
    "we study the flow of a scale - dependent effective action @xmath44 where @xmath45 . here , all wave function renormalizations @xmath46 , the coupling @xmath47 , and the potential @xmath29 depend on a rg scale @xmath8 .",
    "the rg @xmath2 function(al)s for these quantities have been computed in @xcite , using the wetterich equation  @xcite .",
    "this formulation of the functional rg is useful as it makes no assumptions about the magnitude of the running masses and couplings , and incorporates dynamically generated thresholds .",
