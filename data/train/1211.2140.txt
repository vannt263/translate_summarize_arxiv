    "if one combines today s standard model of particle physics ( sm ) and that of cosmology , one finds inevitably that particles and their antiparticles annihilate at a very early moment in the evolution of the universe , leaving just radiation behind .",
    "the absence of a sizable matter - antimatter asymmetry at this epoch would imply that the universe as we know it could never form .",
    "the question about the origin of the observed asymmetry therefore represents a major challenge for modern physics .    in the sm baryon and lepton number",
    "are ( accidental ) global symmetries .",
    "if baryon number was also conserved in the early universe a dynamical emergence of the asymmetry would have been impossible . in grand - unified extensions ( guts ) of the sm baryon number ( and also lepton number )",
    "is explicitly broken . according to past reasoning",
    ", this could provide a solution to the apparent discrepancy . in the class of `",
    "gut - baryogenesis ' scenarios the matter - antimatter imbalance is generated by asymmetric decays of new super - heavy bosons .",
    "anomalous electroweak processes @xcite ( sphalerons ) which violate baryon and lepton number but conserve their difference essentially eliminated the prospects for gut - baryogenesis @xcite . at the same time , it inspired the now widely appreciated scenarios of ` electroweak baryogenesis ' @xcite and ` baryogenesis via leptogenesis ' @xcite . according to the latter scenario , the asymmetry is initially generated in the leptonic sector by the decay of heavy majorana neutrinos at an energy scale far above the electroweak scale .",
    "subsequently it is converted into the observed baryon asymmetry by sphalerons .",
    "the mass scale of the heavy majorana neutrinos required for leptogenesis  @xcite fits together very well with the mass - differences inferred from observations of solar- , atmospheric- and reactor - neutrino oscillations .",
    "we focus here on the conventional , but most popular , high - energy ( type - i ) seesaw extension : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the heavy majorana fields , @xmath2 are the lepton doublets , @xmath3 is the conjugate of the higgs doublet , and @xmath4 are the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "the majorana mass term violates lepton number and the yukawa couplings can violate _",
    "therefore the model fulfills essential requirements for baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "they can also be realized for more complicated sm extensions and a wide range of values for couplings and neutrino masses @xcite . in general the right - handed neutrinos",
    "do not necessarily get into thermal equilibrium and _ cp_-violating oscillations between them can contribute to the asymmetry .",
    "this effect of leptogenesis through neutrino oscillations @xcite is crucial for neutrino - minimal extensions of the sm ( @xmath5msm ) @xcite and poses interesting questions for non - equilibrium quantum field theory @xcite . in the considered scenario of thermal leptogenesis the heavy majorana neutrinos experience only a moderate deviation from thermal equilibrium at the time when the bulk of the asymmetry is produced .",
    "also , for a hierarchical mass spectrum , effects related to oscillations are negligible .",
    "the amount of the generated asymmetry is determined by the out of equilibrium evolution of the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "therefore , statistical equations for the abundance of the neutrinos and the generated asymmetry are needed .",
    "the conventional approach here follows the lines developed for gut - baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "cp_-violating amplitudes for the decay and scattering processes involving the heavy majorana neutrinos are computed in terms of feynman graphs at lowest loop order .",
    "they are used to build generalized boltzmann collision terms for these processes .",
    "each of them contributes to the evolution of the distributions of majorana neutrinos and leptons or , upon momentum integration , their entire abundances .",
    "however this approach is plagued by the so - called double - counting problem which manifests itself in the generation of a non - vanishing asymmetry even in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this technical issue is expression of the fact that the ` naive ' generalization of the collision terms is quantitatively inexact , and inconsistent in the presence of _ cp_-violation . after a real intermediate state ( or ris )",
    "subtraction procedure and a number of approximations , it can be made consistent with fundamental requirements .",
    "nevertheless this pragmatic solution remains unsatisfactory .",
    "the requirement of unitarity guarantees a consistent approximation for the amplitudes , realized by the ris subtraction , if the statistical system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , the deviation from equilibrium is a fundamental requirement for leptogenesis and it is not obvious how the equations have to be generalized for a system out of equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the _ cp_-violation arises from one - loop contributions due to the exchange of virtual quanta . as such they seem to be beyond a boltzmann approximation .",
    "but the relevant imaginary part is due to intermediate states in which at least some of the particles are on - shell .",
    "these can also be absorbed or emitted by the medium and it is not obvious how such contributions enter the amplitudes .",
    "it is , however , clear that the influence of medium effects on the one - loop contributions enters directly the _ cp_-violating parameter and therefore the source for the lepton asymmetry .",
    "their size can be of the same order as that of the vacuum contributions .",
    "those questions can be addressed within a first - principle approach based on non - equilibrium quantum field theory ( neqft ) .",
    "several aspects of leptogenesis have already been investigated within this approach @xcite .",
    "the influence of medium effects on the generation of the asymmetry has been studied e.g.  in @xcite , and an analysis with special emphasis on off - shell effects was performed in  @xcite .",
    "the role of flavor effects as well as the range of applicability of the conventional approach to the analysis of flavored leptogenesis has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the resonant enhancement of the lepton asymmetry has been addressed within a first - principle approach in @xcite .",
    "in addition , steps towards a consistent inclusion of gauge interactions have been taken  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the 2pi - formalism of neqft to derive boltzmann - like quantum kinetic equations for the lepton asymmetry .",
    "in particular , we show how two - body scattering processes that violate lepton number by two units and contribute to the washout of the asymmetry emerge within the 2pi - formalism .",
    "this approach treats quantum field theory and the out of equilibrium evolution on an equal footing and allows to overcome the conceptional difficulties inherent in the conventional approach .",
    "it allows us to obtain quantum - generalized boltzmann equations which include medium effects and which are free of the double - counting problem . in other words",
    ", the structure of the obtained quantum kinetic equations automatically ensures that the asymmetry vanishes in thermal equilibrium and no need for ris subtraction arises .",

    "note that @xmath11 vanishes in equilibrium due to detailed balance .",
    "this ensures that the asymmetry vanishes in thermal equilibrium as mentioned before .",
    "the effective amplitudes contain medium effects ignored in the corresponding canonical expressions .",
    "we find that , in the amplitudes of the scattering processes medium effects are sub - dominant and can be neglected .",
    "the total decay amplitude of the majorana neutrino is barely affected as well .",
    "however , at high temperatures the available phase space shrinks when taking gauge interactions in the form of effective thermal masses of higgs and leptons into account .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the decay and scattering rates . since the _ cp_-violation appears as loop effect it is more sensitive to influences of the surrounding medium . even though there is a partial cancellation of the fermionic and bosonic contributions , the _",
    "cp_-violating parameter is enhanced by medium effects .",
    "however , the thermal masses reduce the enhancement and turn it into suppression at high temperatures .",

    "here we work in a regime where the mass splittings @xmath25 are large enough to render effects related to the enhancement of the self - energy contribution irrelevant ( non - resonant leptogenesis ) .",

    "<S> these can easily be compared to conventional results and overcome conceptional problems inherent in the canonical approach . beyond _ </S>",
    "<S> cp_-violating decays we include also those scattering processes which are tightly related to the decays in a consistent approximation of fourth order in the yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated explicitly how the s - matrix elements for the scattering processes in the conventional approach are related to two- and three - loop contributions to the effective action . </S>",
    "<S> we derive effective decay and scattering amplitudes taking medium corrections and thermal masses into account . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate _ </S>",
    "<S> cp_-violating higgs decay within the same formalism . from the kinetic equations we derive rate equations for the lepton asymmetry improved in that they include quantum - statistical effects and medium corrections to the quasiparticle properties . </S>"
