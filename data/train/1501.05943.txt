    "public - key encryption ( pke ) is one of the important branches of cryptography , and has been widely applied into various fields .",
    "classical public - key encryption is based on one - way function with the hardness of solving the computational difficult problem . since the investigation to quantum turing machine",
    "was started and shor s algorithm as well as grover s algorithm were put forward , quantum public - key encryption ( qpke ) emerged as times require .    according to whether the encrypted messages and keys are in quantum states or",

    "the first type is that messages and keys are both classical .",

    "the premise of the bit - oriented qpke is that the quantum key distribution is secure , therefore we concentrate in the study of qpke .",
    "however , how to ensure the quantum key is distributed securely is an important problem which worth the effort to research on .",

    "we wonder whether qpke is also based on one - way function , and what s the one - way property of qpke under the assurance of quantum mechanics .",
    "cca1 , cca2 and semantically secure are all concerned about the security of classical pke .",
    "the quantum counterparts of these also needs to be further developed .",
