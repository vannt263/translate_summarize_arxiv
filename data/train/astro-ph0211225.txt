    "we observe disk galaxies projected at random angles on the sky and must , therefore , determine the inclination geometry for each galaxy in order to deproject line - of - sight velocity data , or discover the intrinsic shape of the disk , etc .",
    "the in - plane orbital speed is needed for mass estimation , and is also one of the parameters required for the tully - fisher relation ( hereafter tfr , tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "furthermore , correction for internal extinction is also inclination - dependent ( e.g. , giovanelli _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) , affecting the total luminosity of the galaxy , the other parameter of the tfr .",
    "thus errors in both the inclination and position angle , propagate directly into dynamical mass estimates , luminosity estimates , and contribute to the scatter in systematic relations .    the most common procedure to determine orientation geometry is to fit ellipses to a photometric image of the galaxy , and to infer the projection geometry by assuming the disk to be intrinsically thin and axisymmetric .",
    "the ellipticity of the projected image , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the semi - minor and semi - major axis lengths , is related to the inclination angle through @xmath4 , for an assumed intrinsically axisymmetric , infinitesimally thin , disk . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the inclination angle of the disk plane to the plane of the sky ( @xmath6 for a face - on galaxy ) , and we use the symbol @xmath7 for position angle of the line of intersection of these two planes . a slightly more complicated relation exists for galaxies that are assumed to be thin oblate spheroids @xcite .    if 2-d velocity fields are available , they can also be used to determine inclinations and position angles .",
    "the previously mentioned assumptions of intrinsic axisymmetry and thinness are again typical .",
    "a drawback to this method is that it is poorly suited to determine inclinations where the rotation curve rises slowly @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", 2-d velocity fields can clearly delineate position angles .",
    "@xcite summarize several other procedures that have been adopted to estimate @xmath8 from photometry in the presence of the complicating non - axisymmetric features ",
    "spirals , bars , lop - sidedness , etc .  ",
    "manifested by virtually all disk galaxies .",
    "the iraf utility _ ellipse _ implements the method outlined by @xcite and fits ellipses to a number of isophotes independently , although the task can be instructed to hold any parameter , such as the photometric center , fixed for all .",
    "the formal statistical uncertainties due to noise in the data ( hereafter abbreviated to statistical uncertainties ) in the fitted parameters are not easily obtained @xcite , but are generally quite small .",
    "the user of this utility then has to make a judgement as to which isophote , or group of isophotes , offers the best estimate of the projection geometry .",
    "a common prejudice is that the outer disk is more likely to be intrinsically round , leading to a preference for the outermost , or the average of several outer ellipses .",
    "another strategy is to identify the true shape with a radial range over which the fitted parameters do not vary much .",
    "such a procedure clearly does not utilize all the information in the image .",
    "more sophisticated methods include : minimizing the @xmath9 component of the fourier transform of an image @xcite , bulge - disk decomposition @xcite , maximizing the @xmath10 component of deprojected images @xcite , and fitting a parametric model for the disk @xcite .",
    "we propose another global method which , like those just cited , assumes that the galaxy disk is infinitesimally thin and intrinsically axisymmetric .",
    "our method returns @xmath8 and @xmath7 values from a chi - squared minimization using a large part of the image .",
    "the details are summarized in the appendix .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the methods described above is usually small , but it is clear that the possible systematic error could be large if the disk is intrinsically non - circular or if nonaxisymmetric features are present . in this paper , we attempt to quantify the possible systematic error from a detailed re - analysis of the photometric and 2-d kinematic maps of a sample of 74 spiral galaxies already reported by @xcite ( hereafter pw ) .    after briefly introducing the data sets used in the study in  [ data ] , we give a general discussion (  [ uncert ] ) of the statistical and systematic errors that can arise when estimating projection angles . in  [ result ] , we present the results of photometric and kinematic fitting procedures applied to the pw galaxies .",
    "unlike these authors , however , we study possible systematic errors in estimating the projection parameters by comparing our fits to the kinematic and photometric data .",
    "we have used the disk fitting methods described in the appendix to estimate the projection angles , @xmath5 and @xmath7 , from the @xmath11-band photometry and 2-d velocity fields for the 74 galaxies in the pw sample .",
    "pw kindly provided the reduced photometric images with the foreground stars removed .",
    "pw also determined 2-d velocity fields for the same galaxies from h@xmath12 spectroscopy taken with the rutgers fabry - perot imaging spectrophotometer .",
    "they obtained several ( 8 to 15 ) images spaced by 1  ( @xmath13 km / s at h@xmath12 ) of each galaxy from which they derived data cubes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these cubes were then reduced to 2d spatial maps by fitting the line profiles at each pixel with a voigt function . again , pw kindly supplied us with the resulting velocity fields , h@xmath12 intensities , continuum intensities , and their respective uncertainties .",
    "inclined galaxies were preferred in this sample , which is therefore notably deficient in nearly face - on systems .",
    "this selection bias makes our study complementary to those by @xcite and @xcite who focused on face - on systems .",
    "noise in the data ( photometric or kinematic ) creates statistical parameter uncertainties , @xmath15 , which can be measured in a variety of ways . for example , the curvature of the reduced chi - squared , @xmath16 , surface at the minimum , @xmath17 , or better , the distance from the minimum at which @xmath18 , allows estimates of the statistical uncertainies in the parameters , and any covariances .",
    "confidence limits can be determined from the contours at @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of degrees of freedom , i.e. , the number of pixels minus the number of free parameters in the fit , and @xmath21 is an integer . clearly , the magnitudes of the statistical uncertainties in the estimated parameters are small when many pixels are used , and statistical uncertainties in the projection angles frequently turn out to be @xmath22 .",
    "sources of systematic uncertainties , @xmath23 , in photometric ellipse fitting include : ( 1 ) seeing , ( 2 ) dust obscuration , ( 3 ) finite disk thickness , ( 4 ) non - axisymmetric features in the disk , and ( 5 ) intrinsic ellipticity of the disk .",
    "velocity field fitting is also subject to similar systematics .",
    "points 4 and 5 are relevant to both methods .",
    "additionally , if a nearly edge - on galaxy with finite thickness has rotational velocities that decrease with height away from the midplane , fitting a thin disk model leads to an apparent inclination that is somewhat less edge - on than in reality .",
    "seeing tends to bias elliptical isophotes towards becoming round .",
    "while it is most severe in the central regions , the effect can be of the same order as an intrinsic ellipticity for moderate distances from the center @xcite . using the typical seeing value quoted in pw of @xmath24 and figure 1 of @xcite",
    ", we find that at a radius 12 times the seeing length a measured @xmath8 value is @xmath25 of its actual value .",
    "this can lead to errors in @xmath5 of a few degrees , depending on the value of @xmath5 .",
    "however , since most of the pixels utilized to make the fits lie beyond 12 times the seeing length ( and are less affected by seeing ) , the effect is probably less important than others we discuss below .    since inclined galaxies suffer more extinction than do face - on galaxies , dust is a source of systematic error .",
    "its effect can be reduced by utilizing photometry in near ir bands where dust extinction is less severe , as we do in this study .    using simulation and analytical work",
    ", we have found that photometrically determined @xmath5 values are significantly affected by finite thickness only for the most edge - on galaxies ( inclination @xmath26 ) .",
    "photometric fits of model inclined oblate spheroids agree well with the formula given in @xcite relating inclination , apparent axis ratio , and spheroidal axis ratio .",
    "since the majority of the pw galaxies have @xmath27 , we ignore this complication hereafter .",
    "nonaxisymmetric structures in disks , such as bars , spirals , and warps , are a major source of systematic error .",
    "@xcite investigated the impact of spiral structure on the photometric estimation of position angles , particularly the case of highly inclined galaxies , finding that spiral structure can introduce uncertainties in @xmath7 values of @xmath28 .",
    "we refer to the impact of all such nonaxisymmetric structure on the photometric projection angles as the spiral effect .",
    "several studies , most notably @xcite , have found hints that the disks of spirals are not perfectly axisymmetric , which may arise because the gravitational potential well within which the disk material orbits is intrinsically non - axisymmetric .",
    "we distinguish this global intrinsic oval distortion of the disk from more obvious features in the disk , such as spiral arms and bars .",
    "one reason for drawing this distinction is that the spiral effect can be investigated using photometric data only , while the effects of intrinsic ellipticity should be most clear when photometric data are compared to kinematic data @xcite .",
    "depending on how the major axis of an elliptic disk is projected , an intrinsic ellipticity can lead to either larger or smaller inferred ellipticity values , leading to over- or under - estimates of the inclination , and to corresponding errors in the position angle .",
    "pw determined the projection angles for each galaxy separately from the photometric and kinematic data .",
    "in general , they found somewhat different values from the two methods , which was inconvenient for their objective .",
    "they wished to compare the observed rotation curve with that predicted from a photometric disk mass model , which requires a common projection geometry for both .",
    "they argued that the inclination and position of the geometric center could be determined most reliably from the photometry , while the position angle of the major axis was best determined from the kinematics .",
    "they then re - fitted both data sets with the preferred parameter from the other set held fixed .",
    "our inclinations derived from photometry are in good agreement with the values reported in pw .",
    "while reassuring , the agreement is scarcely surprising as we are using similar methods to fit the same photometric data .",
    "discrepancies arise , in part , because we have fitted for both @xmath5 and @xmath7 while in pw @xmath7 was held fixed at the value determined from the kinematics , but the good agreement ( the average difference between our @xmath29 values and those of pw is @xmath30 shows that this constraint has a small effect .",
    "the largest difference is @xmath31 and occurs for eso 510g11 , a galaxy with very strong spirals that extend into the outer parts of the disk .",
    "one of our principal objectives here is to understand the discrepancy between the photometric and kinematic values of the projection angles for each galaxy .",
    "the magnitudes of these differences are illustrated in figures [ comp]a and [ comp]b .",
    "the statistical uncertainties are much smaller than the symbols in both figures .",
    "the inclinations show considerable spread around perfect agreement ( figure [ comp]a ) .",
    "the average photometric / kinematic inclination difference is @xmath0 with a standard deviation of similar magnitude . a comparison of position angles ( figure [ comp]b ) shows a similar spread , with one extreme outlier which we discuss briefly below .",
    "the average difference between position angle estimates is @xmath32 ( excluding the extreme outlier ) .",
    "note , however , that this galaxy sample is deficient in nearly face - on galaxies and that @xcite found larger differences in a sample of 10 low inclination ( @xmath33 ) galaxies .",
    "figures [ diffvsi]a and [ diffvsi]b show the relations between the inclination and position angle differences and the photometric inclination of the galaxy . while there is significant spread in figure [ diffvsi]b , there appears to be a trend for more highly inclined galaxies to have smaller position angle differences .",
    "such a trend is expected , since any nonaxisymmetric structures present in highly - inclined galaxies should have only a small effect on @xmath34 .",
    "this trend also agrees with the aforementioned larger differences found for low inclination galaxies @xcite .",
    "the largest position angle difference in figure [ diffvsi]b corresponds to a galaxy which has a low inclination and strong spirals which extend to the outer reaches of the disk .",
    "it is a prime example of the kind of systematic error that can be attributed to the spiral effect .",
    "additionally , this kind of misalignment could cause serious problems if single - slit spectroscopic data were to be utilized to determine rotation curves .",
    "misalignment between the slit and the true major axis results in an underestimate of rotational speed and hence dynamical mass .",
    "in all the work reported elsewhere in this paper , we have required the rotation center of our fitted model to coincide with the peak of continuum brightness in the image ( see appendix ) . in this subsection",
    ", we report the consequences of relaxing this requirement and determine the kinematic center from the velocity field alone .",
    "the offset between the kinematic and photometric centers , and the resulting differences in estimates for @xmath5 and @xmath7 are illustrated in figure [ hists ] .",
    "figure [ hists]a shows that the kinematic center is @xmath35 from the photometric center in the majority ( 67 of 74 ) of galaxies .",
    "the galaxy for which this distance is largest , eso 322g42 , has a slowly rising rotation curve , which creates nearly parallel isovelocity contours ; the location of the center and the overall systemic velocity are poorly constrained by such data , but the inner slope of the rotation curve is independent of the center location .",
    "six other galaxies are in the tail ( @xmath36 ) : one ( eso 445g19 ) has a strongly asymmetric inner velocity field , while the others are either nearly edge - on and have roughly parallel isovels and slowly rising rotation curves , or lack h@xmath12 emission near the center ; the location of the rotation center is not tightly constrained in the absence of kinematic information near the center .",
    "as evidenced by the histograms in figures [ hists]b and c , the projection angles that result from fitting with the kinematic center free to move agree with those from the fixed - center fits for the majority of the galaxies .",
    "in fact , none of the @xmath7 values changes by more than @xmath37 .",
    "the changes in inclination show a larger range , but 70 of 74 galaxies have @xmath38 . the galaxy with the largest @xmath39 shows evidence of being tidally distorted , having a long filament of anomalous velocities extending from its edge . the two galaxies with the next largest @xmath39 values both have strong spirals resulting in velocity fields with strong distortions .",
    "the remaining galaxy in the tail of the @xmath39 histogram is a highly inclined galaxy that is also in the tail of the @xmath40 histogram .    we find that unless the kinematic center is poorly constrained by a slowly rising rotation curve , it lies within @xmath41 of the position of the photometric center for most galaxies",
    "so , if rotation curves of our galaxy sample were determined from single - slit spectra taken through the point of maximum continuum , they would not be significantly biased towards rising slowly .",
    "allowing a small shift in the kinematic center generally makes little difference to the estimated projection angles , except in a few special cases .      in an attempt to estimate the magnitude of the uncertainties due to the spiral effect",
    ", we have proceeded as follows .",
    "( note that these values must be viewed as lower limits to the true systematics , which are unknown . )",
    "we use a first estimate of the photometric projection parameters from our @xmath16 minimization procedure to deproject a galaxy image .",
    "we then rotate it through an angle @xmath42 , so that the nonaxisymmetric structure lies in a new orientation , and then reproject it to the original best - fit @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "we then apply our photometric fitting apparatus to this new image to find new best - fit @xmath5 and @xmath7 values .",
    "we interpret the spread in both @xmath5 and @xmath7 as @xmath42 varies through a half - rotation as the measures of systematic uncertainties @xmath43 and @xmath44 due to the presence of nonaxisymmetric features in the image .",
    "a few representative plots of @xmath5 and @xmath7 versus @xmath42 are presented in the next section .",
    "the results of this investigation are shown in figure [ sysfig ] .",
    "galaxies that have @xmath45 have been excluded from this analysis because deprojection must be considered suspect for such large inclination angles .",
    "the general trend of decreasing @xmath43 and @xmath44 with increasing @xmath5 concurs with our earlier assertion that nonaxisymmetric structure should compromise the model fits more modestly for highly inclined galaxies .",
    "the galaxy with the highest values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( eso 323g39 ) appears to have a significant bar .",
    "the numbers in figure [ sysfig ] denote different galaxy @xmath46-types , where low numbers indicate early - type spirals and high numbers indicate late - type spirals and irregulars .",
    "the different @xmath46-types do not nicely segregate in either frame of figure [ sysfig ] .",
    "however , there is a statistical trend for later type galaxies to have larger @xmath43 and @xmath44 values .",
    "early type spirals ( @xmath46-types 0 - 3 ) have average @xmath43 values of @xmath47 and average @xmath44 values of @xmath32 .",
    "spirals with @xmath46-types between 4 and 6 have average @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ". late type spirals ( @xmath46-types @xmath50 ) have average @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the differences between the means of the early and intermediate spirals are not statistically significant .",
    "however , the differences between the early and late types means are significant at the 95% level . for all galaxies with @xmath53 , the average @xmath48 and @xmath54 , with a large spread for both values .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath55 and @xmath44 suggest that the uncertainties in @xmath5 and @xmath7 values derived from photometry are dominated by systematic uncertainty due to nonaxisymmetric structure .",
    "we find differences between the projection angles determined by fitting photometric and kinematic data .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and others suggest that such disagreements are evidence of intrinsically elliptical disks , but such a conclusion requires that the projection angles can be determined with sufficient precision for their differences to have meaning .    our investigation of the spiral effect points to significant systematic errors in the photometric determination of projection angles which are of the same magnitude as the errors suggested by @xcite to explain the scatter in the tfr .",
    "this leads us to wonder whether differences between photometric and kinematic projection angles are evidence of anything more than our ignorance of the true angles .",
    "fortunately , we can use our 2d velocity fields to search for evidence of intrinsic ellipticity .",
    "@xcite formulate elliptical orbits in disks in the epicyclic approximation with a small @xmath9 forcing term added to the central attaction .",
    "this distortion is entirely contained within the plane of the disk .",
    "for the special case of a flat rotation curve , the distortions in the radial and tangential directions are equal and can be described by ,    @xmath56    and @xmath57.\\ ] ]    here @xmath58 is the circular speed , @xmath59 is the intrinsic ellipticity of the disk , @xmath60 is the angle in the disk measured from the projected major axis , and @xmath61 is the angle between the projected major axis and the elliptical disk minor axis .",
    "when such a disk is inclined , the line - of - sight velocity field appears as that of an axisymmetric disk with small correction terms added , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the line - of - sight velocity for an axisymmetric disk with the same projection angles .",
    "equation [ evlos ] demonstrates that a mildly elliptical disk creates an @xmath64 distortion in the residual velocity field , at a position angle which depends on @xmath61 .",
    "( there is also an @xmath65 term in the more general case of a non - flat rotation curve , see franx , van gorkom , & de zeeuw 1994 for details . )    in order to quantify the strength of such distortions , we introduce two quantities , @xmath66 and @xmath67 which we derive from the velocity residuals in the following way .",
    "we divide the residual field inside the outermost fitting ellipse into 15 elliptical annuli , and divide each annulus into quadrants .",
    "we label the first quadrant ( i ) to be that bounded by the receding side of the projected major axis and the minor axis counter - clockwise from it , and the remaining quadrants ( ii , iii , iv ) are in the usual order . for each quadrant in each annulus , we calculate the average of the residuals @xmath68 , normalized by the average of the magnitude of the residuals in the entire field .",
    "we then define @xmath66 and @xmath67 values for each annulus as follows ,    @xmath69    and @xmath70    basically , @xmath66 measures the strength of an @xmath64 distortion across the major axis , while @xmath67 measures the same thing across the minor axis .",
    "plotting @xmath71 values versus the semi - major axis of the annulus provides an asymmetry profile .    using equation [ evlos ] ,",
    "we have constructed a model residual velocity field for a disk with nested similar concentric elliptical orbits .",
    "the resulting asymmetry profile rises rapidly in the central region of the residual field , but then flattens and remains constant for the remaining radial range .",
    "none of the galaxies we have studied show this kind of asymmetry profile .",
    "galaxies which have bars and/or strong spirals show peaks in their asymmetry profiles ( for example , figures [ 439g20]c vi and [ 439g20]d vi ) , but the distortion is localized and not seen throughout the entire disk .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a higher - than - average level of asymmetry in a velocity field is not always associated with a significant difference between photometric and kinematic projection angles .",
    "here we present several individual galaxies that illustrate the difficulty of measuring accurate projection angles . for each galaxy ,",
    "we show an @xmath11-band image , a 2d velocity field , a residual photometric image , a residual velocity field , a plot illustrating the spiral effect , and an asymmetry profile .",
    "the photometric images are presented in grayscales with units of magnitudes per arcsecond squared .",
    "the white circles in the photometric images mark the locations of stars that have been removed . in the photometric residual images , the central white circles mask the pixels that are associated with a bulge and/or bar and",
    "are therefore not included in the fits .",
    "the velocity fields are given in units of kilometers per second .",
    "the velocity and residual velocity fields display the pixels with measurement uncertainties less than 25 km / s .",
    "the suppressed pixels do not strongly influence the fitted parameters .",
    "the spiral effect plot is composed of one frame showing the response of the fitted @xmath5 value to the rotation of the image and another showing how @xmath7 changes with the rotation . in the asymmetry profiles",
    ", asterisks mark the @xmath72 values for the residual velocity fields .",
    "since photometric data is often more extensive than kinematic data , some of the images in the following figures may appear unequal .",
    "as described in the appendix , the data used by our fitting routine is different for photometric and kinematic fits .",
    "however , we utilize the maximum amount of information in both cases . to test the impact of the differing radial extents of the data , we fit the photometric data over the same radial range as the kinematic data",
    ". there were no significant changes in the average differences between photometric and kinematic inclinations or position angles .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , the results given are derived using the maximum amount of information for the data set .",
    "the photometric images of eso 439g20 ( figure [ 439g20]a i ) and eso 322g45 ( figure [ 322g45]b i ) appear to be free of strong bars and spiral structure .",
    "their respective velocity fields also appear to be those of simple inclined axisymmetric disks ( figures [ 439g20]a ii and [ 322g45]b ii ) .",
    "the naive assumption is that these two `` nice '' galaxies should show little asymmetry and should have good agreement between their photometric and kinematic projection angles .    for eso 439g20 , the photometric and kinematic @xmath5 difference is @xmath73 and the @xmath7 difference is @xmath74 .",
    "the lack of strong nonaxisymmetric structure is evident from the photometric residual ( figure [ 439g20]a iii ) and the plot illustrating the spiral effect ( figure [ 439g20]a v ) .",
    "the asymmetry profile ( figure [ 439g20]a vi ) shows little influence of bars or spirals .",
    "the last @xmath72 value is due to the small blue and red spots on either side of the minor axis on the right side of figure [ 439g20]a iv .",
    "eso 322g45 has an @xmath5 difference of @xmath75 and a @xmath7 difference of @xmath76 .",
    "figures [ 322g45]b iii and [ 322g45]b v are evidence that there is little asymmetry in the photometric image .",
    "again , the asymmetry profile ( figure [ 322g45]b vi ) is fairly featureless .",
    "the last two @xmath72 values may be the effect of a weak spiral arm that appears in the photometric residual image @xmath77 arcsec from the center .",
    "it is surprising that such a featureless galaxy has large @xmath5 and @xmath7 differences , but they can not be symptoms of intrinsic ellipticity in the disk , for the following reasons : an elliptical disk viewed in projection should generally give rise to the type of asymmetry profile discussed in  [ intell ] , which is not seen in fig .",
    "the special case of projection about one of the disk s principal axes could mask this signature , but then we should not expect a significant @xmath78 , which we also find .",
    "thus , we are confident that the differences in this case are not due to an intrinsically elliptic disk .    these two galaxies serve to illustrate the point that just because a galaxy s image or velocity field appears smooth or simple does not imply accurate estimation of projection angles .",
    "in contrast to the previous examples , we present two galaxies whose photometric images ( figures [ 267g29]c i and [ 569g17]d i ) show strong bars and spiral structure .",
    "their velocity fields ( figures [ 267g29]c ii and [ 569g17]d ii ) contain distorted isovelocity contours , evidence of strong nonaxisymmetric structure . in these cases , it is not unreasonable to believe that estimation of projection angles will be problematic .",
    "eso 267g29 has a photometric / kinematic @xmath5 difference of @xmath79 and a @xmath7 difference of @xmath80 .",
    "the strong open spiral can be clearly seen in figure [ 267g29]c iii and the effect of the central bar is obvious from the @xmath64 residual pattern in central region of figure [ 267g29]c iv . the asymmetry profile ( figure [ 267g29]c vi ) clearly shows the effect of the central bar with the rise in @xmath72 at large radius due most likely to the strong spiral also present .",
    "to again contrast , the differences between photometric and kinematic @xmath5 and @xmath7 values for eso 569g17 are @xmath81 .",
    "a dusty multi - armed spiral pattern can be seen in figure [ 569g17]d iii .",
    "as before , the effect of the central bar is evident in the residual velocities ( figure [ 569g17]d iv ) . like eso 267g29 , the asymmetry profile in figure [ 569g17]d vi shows the impact of a central bar and some effect from spiral arms .",
    "it is not surprising that if the central region of the velocity field of eso 267g29 is ignored , as it is in the photometry , the differences between photometric and kinematic @xmath5 and @xmath7 drop to @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast , ignoring the central region of the velocity field of eso 569g17 increases the discrepancy between photometric and kinematic projection angles by @xmath83 .",
    "so , even though photometric images and kinematic maps are complicated , the projection angles derived from them can be consistent .",
    "these two examples also suggest that the details of the spiral structure present can significantly alter the photometric / kinematic discrepancy .      as our final example , we present a `` typical '' spiral galaxy .",
    "the photometric / kinematic @xmath5 difference is @xmath84 and the @xmath7 difference is @xmath85 .",
    "the photometry and residuals ( figures [ 215g39]e i and [ 215g39]e ii ) show moderate spiral structure and the velocity field ( figure [ 215g39]e ii ) is fairly simple .",
    "the velocity residual field ( figure [ 215g39]e iv ) shows some evidence of elliptical orbits in the central region .",
    "again , the asymmetry profile ( figure [ 215g39]e vi ) contains evidence of either a weak central bar or spirals near the center .",
    "interestingly , the magnitudes of these photometric / kinematic differences are the same as the predicted differences due to the spiral effect for this galaxy .",
    "we have developed and tested a global fitting method with a novel minimization technique to obtain disk galaxy inclinations and position angles from either photometric or kinematic data . since we fit a thin axisymmetric disk model to all the data at once , we determine globally optimal values for the geometric parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "this contrasts with the iraf _ ellipse _ utility which returns independent @xmath8 and @xmath7 values for each of many ellipses , and can not be constrained to find the best common values .",
    "we map the @xmath16 surface to find the best - fit inclination and position angle and to determine the statistical uncertainty for each fit . due to the large number of data points ( typically @xmath86 ) ,",
    "the statistical uncertainty is very small .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath7 values determined using our method differ only slightly from those previously estimated for the same 74 spiral galaxies by @xcite .",
    "while we have held the rotation center fixed at the location of brightest continuum , changes in derived quantities are generally small when we allow the kinematic center to move from this point .",
    "a major result of this study is that systematics dominate photometrically determined inclination and position angle uncertainties .",
    "we estimate that systematic uncertainties due to nonaxisymmetric structure such as spirals and/or bars are , on average , @xmath32 for inclination estimates and @xmath0 for position angle estimates for galaxies in this sample .",
    "again , we point out that the complete systematic error is unknown , and these estimates must be taken as lower limits .",
    "it is reassuring that the position angle uncertainties tend to be smaller for more edge - on galaxies and that later type spirals generally have larger systematic inclination and position angle uncertainties .",
    "it seems that the only way to reduce these systematic errors would be to model the nonaxisymmetric structure in each galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the average difference in inclination and position angle derived from the photometric and kinematic data turn out to be roughly the same size as our estimates for uncertainties due to nonaxisymmetric structure .",
    "since these differences are also similar to those expected from intrinsically elliptical disks , they reinforce the concern raised by @xcite and @xcite that spiral structure can be confused with intrinsic disk ellipticity . as discussed in ",
    "[ gbu ] , the ( non)existence of spirals and/or bars does not necessarily imply ( small ) large differences between photometric and kinematic projection angles .",
    "we also find no clear evidence for the velocity field distortions expected for intrinsically elliptic disks .    to conclude , we have found a difference between galaxy projection angles determined from photometric and kinematic data for 74 galaxies .",
    "we have also found that nonaxisymmetric structures , such as spirals and bars , impact the galaxies photometric projection angles to about the same extent as the differences between photometric and kinematic projection angles .",
    "further , we see no direct evidence for intrinisically elliptical disks in any of our galaxies residual velocity fields . in light of these points , it seems unnecessary to explain photometric / kinematic projection angle differences with intrinsic disk ellipticities .",
    "we are indebted to povilas palunas for providing us with the reduced data and to our colleagues tad pryor , ted williams , and arthur kosowsky for much thoughtful advice .",
    "thanks also to matt bershady and the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions to improve the paper .",
    "this work was supported by nasa sara grant nag 5 - 10110 .",
    "the principle of our method is to use as much information as possible from a photometric or kinematic image to estimate the two angles of projection .",
    "if a galaxy were a razor - thin , axisymmetric disk and the orbits were circular , then the surface brightness or in - plane orbital speed would be constant on a nested set of concentric , co - axial , similar ellipses .",
    "we utilize the entire velocity field , from the center of the galaxy to beyond its edge , but our photometric fits are to only those parts of the image not strongly contaminated by bulge and/or bar components .",
    "our input data are a set of data values @xmath87 , and their associated uncertainties , @xmath88 , for each of the @xmath89 pixels in the image . for photometric data , on the one hand , the @xmath87 are pixel intensity values ,",
    "for which the principal source of noise is photon counting .",
    "we estimate the sky brightness from part of the image away from the galaxy and subtract its value before beginning the fit . for kinematic data , on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath87 are line - of - sight velocity values and the associated uncertainties result from the fitting of the fabry - perot data cube .",
    "we choose the center to have the coordinates @xmath90 of the pixel that has the largest intensity for a photometric image , or the largest continuum intensity for the velocity map .",
    "we generally hold these coordinates fixed for the entire fitting procedure , although our method can allow the center to move if desired .",
    "we fit a non - parametric profile that is characterized by a tabulated set of values @xmath91 , for a number @xmath92 of semi - major axes .",
    "each @xmath93 has the same value around an ellipse , and all ellipses have a common center and ellipticity , @xmath8 , and major - axis position angle , @xmath7 , embodying our assumption that the disk is thin and axisymmetric . for photometric data ,",
    "the @xmath91 are isophote intensities , while they are circular velocities for a kinematic map .",
    "note such a tabular form makes no assmuption about the radial profile of either the light or the orbital speed .",
    "we derive a model prediction at a general location in the image by finding the semi - major axis of the ellipse that passes through the point in question , and then interpolate for the predicted pixel value from the @xmath91 .",
    "for any values of the projection parameters ( @xmath94 ) , we form @xmath95 ^2,\\ ] ] where the @xmath96 are the weight factors that describe the interpolation scheme , and @xmath20 is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit .",
    "since @xmath16 is linear in the @xmath93s , the @xmath93s that minimize @xmath16 can be determined by setting the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) with respect to each @xmath97 equal to zero and solving the resulting set simultaneous equations , @xmath98 the resulting @xmath93 values are used to determine @xmath16 .",
    "our implementation uses linear interpolation to determine the @xmath96 factors , but more complicated schemes would be straightforward to implement . any pixels that lie outside the final fitting ellipse have their model values linearly extrapolated from the values of the last two ellipses and their weights smoothly decreased depending on their distance from the last ellipse .",
    "such pixels have little impact on the best - fit parameters .",
    "we use slightly different methods to determine which pixels will be used in the fitting procedure for the photometric and kinematic data . in both cases ,",
    "we create a pixel list only once which is used throughout the fitting procedure . with photometric data ,",
    "we exclude pixels contaminated by foreground stars or cosmic rays .",
    "we also exclude those pixels inside a circular aperture containing a central bulge or bar , and set the smallest semi - major axis of the @xmath92 ellipses equal to the radius of this inner aperture .",
    "the outer limit of the pixel list is defined by an outer elliptical aperture with semi - major axis 10% larger than that of the outermost fitting ellipse , using an initial estimate of the ellipticity .",
    "the pixel list for the kinematic data contains all pixels that have continuum intensity values @xmath99 the central continuum intensity .",
    "we add , in quadrature , a fixed velocity dispersion of @xmath100 km  s@xmath101 to the estimated velocity uncertainty in the line fit .",
    "some anomalous velocities remain in the velocity map , possibly caused by intervening gas not associated with the galaxy of interest or from voigt profile fits near the velocity limits of the fabry - perot data cube ; we eliminate such values by applying a simple cut to exclude pixels with velocities more than 500 km / s away from the data value at the fixed center .",
    "we vary the two projection angles , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , recomputing the @xmath91 at each iteration to determine their values that minimize @xmath16 .",
    "we use a downhill simplex method , specifically the _ amoeba _ routine described in @xcite , which requires only @xmath16 function evaluations ( no derivatives ) and initial estimates for @xmath8 and @xmath7 . following the recommendation of @xcite",
    ", the @xmath8 and @xmath7 estimates returned are re - used as initial guesses for up to 5 subsequent calls to _ amoeba _ to converge to the @xmath16 minimum .",
    "we have verified the minimum location by inspecting the @xmath16 surface surrounding the best - fit values .",
    "projections of the contour where @xmath102 onto the @xmath8 and @xmath7 axes provide 1-@xmath103 statistical uncertainty measurements .",
    "figure [ iplot ] shows the results of photometric fitting for one galaxy in our sample ( eso 215g39 ) .",
    "the model isointensity values are shown as filled circles superimposed on data values .",
    "the solid lines encompass 68% of the data values .",
    "the statistical uncertainties of the parameters ( dot values ) are smaller than the symbols .",
    "the rotation curve with 1-@xmath103 parameter uncertainties resulting from the kinematic fit for the same galaxy is shown in figure [ vplot ] ."
