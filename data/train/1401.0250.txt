    "the backgrounds appear in two kind of processes .",
    "the first , called irreducible background comes from photoproduction with very similar final state as the signal .",
    "the second has the same final state but occurs through different processes induced by partonic interactions and is called reducible background . the key difference between photoprduction and partonic interactions at the @xmath4 lies in the absence of colour exchange on the photon side .",
    "this causes an important zone of rapidity to be completely devoid of hadronic activity called a large rapidity gap(@xmath224 ) and which is natural way to distinguish photoproduction and partonic backgrounds . in the framework of epa ,",
    "emitted quasi - real photons from the protons have a low virtuality and scattered with small angles from the beam pipe .",
    "therefore when a proton emits a quasi - real photon it should also be scattered with a small angle .",
    "hence , intact scattered protons exit the central detector without being detected .",
    "this causes a decrease in the energy deposit in the corresponding forward region compared to the case in which the proton remnants are detected by the calorimeters .",
    "consequently , for any reaction like @xmath225 , one of the forward regions of the central detector has a significant lack of energy .",
    "the region with a lack of energy ( or equivalently lack of particles ) defines a forward @xmath224 .",
    "backgrounds from usual @xmath20 deep inelastic processes can be rejected by applying a selection cut on this quantity .",
    "in addition , another tagging method based on the same physics properties of photoproduction events is to place an exclusivity condition on reconstructed particle tracks on the gap side which can obviously reduce patronic backgrounds@xcite .",
    "even if both conditions are used and partronic background is reduced to a level that not allows proper signal extraction , elastic photon emission can be tagged using very forward detector ( @xmath226)@xcite placed hundreds of meters away from the interaction point . for instance , the case for which @xmath226 stations would be put at 220 m and 420 m from the interaction point and is mandatory in order to retain partonic backgrounds low@xcite .",
    "indeed , when an intact proton is scattered with a large pseudorapidity it escapes detection from the central detectors .",
    "but since its energy is lower than the beam energy , its trajectory decouples from the beam path into the very forward region .",
    "forward detectors can detect particles with a large pseudorapidity .",
    "the detection of final state intact protons by the forward detectors provides a characteristic signature .",
    "backgrounds from usual @xmath227 processes can also be rejected by use of this characteristic signature provided by the forward detectors .",
    "therefore in our paper , the only considered backgrounds come from protoproduction . from this point we can see that the backgrounds would come from @xmath19 plus @xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) photoproduction .",
    "different from normal @xmath20 collision , in @xmath25 collisions where photoproduction of top quark pairs has similar cross sections like , for example , @xmath230 productions , only @xmath2311.4 pb@xcite , while for @xmath229 , roughly @xmath231 16fb after considering the fake b - tagging efficiency , leading such related background processes easier going than in case of the @xmath20 collision .",
    "here we assume that the @xmath17 fully decay to @xmath232 if @xmath233 while @xmath234 @xcite should be considered if @xmath235 . for the @xmath236 gauge bosons @xmath53 decay leptonically , @xmath237 ,",
    "the signal is @xmath238 ^ 2 \\times [ 3\\times br(w\\rightarrow \\ell \\nu)]^2 $ ] and the corresponding background as @xmath239 ^ 2 \\times [ 3\\times br(w\\rightarrow \\ell \\nu)]^2 $ ] with @xmath240 and @xmath241 is the fake b - tagging efficiency of the jets . for c - jets and light jets , a fake b - tagging efficiency of 10@xmath242 and 1@xmath242",
    "respectively is assumed .",
    "here we take @xmath243 and @xmath244 . for the luminosity",
    "@xmath245 we take @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , respectively . in table.[tab3 ] , we present the parameters sensitivity on the signal background ratio @xmath249 . here",
    "we choose @xmath170 .",
    "the background cross section after consider all the b - tagging efficiency and the rejection factors for the @xmath250 and light jets is 1.68 @xmath251 .",
    "the @xmath252 and @xmath253 bounds of the parameters are presented with three values of the luminosity . for @xmath254 ,",
    "the new physics signal will be detected obviously while for @xmath255 it will be challenge to be detected .",
    "our results show that , for low @xmath8 , the @xmath7 discovery range is larger than the case of high @xmath8 . as the top - pion mass becomes larger , the @xmath7 discovery range is suppressed .",
    "when @xmath256 , heavy final state strongly suppress the phase space .",
    "the signal becomes much small and makes it more challenge to be detected . in this case , higher luminosity is needed to make the detection possible and push the discovery boundary larger .",
    "two ways can be used in order to constraint the parameters or the excluding boundary more strictly : one is , as we see , to enhance the luminosity which can expand the related parameter space , see in table.[tab3 ] , while the other one is to take more kinematical cuts to improve the ratio @xmath249 . in our case for example , if a @xmath257 cut taken to be larger than 200 @xmath71 can strongly suppress the @xmath258 backgrounds and thus lead better @xmath249 in parts of the @xmath0 parameter space .",
    ".[tab3 ] the @xmath0 parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 sensitivities on the signal background ratio @xmath249 . @xmath252 for the discovery boundary and @xmath253 for the excluding boundary .",
    "the detector acceptance here is chosen to be @xmath170 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , we present the precise photoproduced charged top - pion @xmath17 production associated with a top through @xmath259 at the 14 @xmath3 @xmath4 at nlo qcd loop level .",
    "we find the cross sections are sensitive to @xmath0 parameters , and the smaller the @xmath7 is or the lighter the top - pion @xmath205 is , the larger the cross sections will be .",
    "the typical @xmath6 correction value is @xmath9 which does not depend much on the @xmath0 parameter @xmath7 as well as the detector acceptances @xmath196 .",
