    "the exploration of cp violation , which was discovered in 1964 through the observation of @xmath20 decays @xcite , is one of the hot topics in particle physics . in this decade , studies of @xmath0-meson decays will provide various stringent tests of the kobayashi  maskawa mechanism of cp violation @xcite , allowing us to accommodate this phenomenon in the standard model of electroweak interactions . at present , the experimental stage is governed by the asymmetric @xmath21 @xmath0 factories operating at the @xmath22 resonance , with their detectors babar ( slac ) and belle ( kek ) .",
    "interesting @xmath0-physics results are also soon expected from run ii of the tevatron @xcite .",

    "if we take into account next - to - leading order terms in the wolfenstein expansion of the ckm matrix @xcite , following the prescription given in @xcite , we obtain the following coordinates for the apex of the unitarity triangle : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the goal is to overconstrain the unitarity triangle as much as possible . in this respect ,",
    "a first important milestone has already been achieved by the babar and belle collaborations , who have announced the observation of cp violation in the @xmath0-meson system in the summer of 2001 @xcite .",
    "this discovery was made possible by @xmath25 and similar channels .",
    "as is well known , these modes allow us to determine @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the cp - violating weak @xmath28@xmath29 mixing phase , which is given by @xmath30 in the standard model . using the present world average @xmath31 @xcite ,",
    "we obtain the following twofold solution for @xmath27 itself : @xmath32 where the former would be in perfect agreement with the `` indirect '' range implied by the ckm fits , @xmath33 @xcite , while the latter would correspond to new physics .",
    "the two solutions can be distinguished through a measurement of the sign of @xmath34 .",
    "several strategies to accomplish this important task were proposed @xcite .",
    "for example , in the @xmath35 system , @xmath36 can be extracted with the help of the time - dependent angular distribution of the @xmath37   k^\\ast[\\to\\pi^0k_{\\rm s}]$ ] decay products if the sign of a hadronic parameter @xmath38 , involving a strong phase @xmath39 , is fixed through factorization @xcite .",
    "this analysis is already in progress at the @xmath0 factories @xcite .",
    "a remarkable link between the two solutions for @xmath27 and ranges for @xmath15 is also suggested by recent data on the cp - violating @xmath40 observables @xcite .",
    "interesting tools for the exploration of cp violation are provided by @xmath3 , @xmath4  and @xmath6 , @xmath7  modes , which originate from @xmath41 and @xmath42 transitions , respectively , and receive only contributions from tree - diagram - like topologies @xcite@xcite .",
    "the neutral @xmath9 mesons may be observed through decays into cp eigenstates @xmath12 , or through decays into cp non - eigenstates @xmath13 . in a recent paper @xcite , we pointed out that @xmath43 and @xmath44   decays , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the cp - even and cp - odd eigenstates of the neutral @xmath9-meson system , respectively , offer very efficient , theoretically clean determinations of the angle @xmath15 of the unitarity triangle . in this strategy , only `` untagged '' and mixing - induced cp - violating observables are employed , which satisfy a very simple relation , allowing us to determine @xmath47 . using a plausible dynamical assumption ,",
    "@xmath15 can be fixed in an essentially unambiguous manner .",
    "the corresponding formalism can also be applied to @xmath48  and @xmath49 decays .",
    "although these modes appear less attractive for the extraction of @xmath15 , they provide interesting determinations of @xmath50 . in comparison with the conventional @xmath51 and @xmath52 methods , these extractions",
    "do not suffer from any penguin uncertainties , and are theoretically cleaner by one order of magnitude .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give a more detailed discussion of the @xmath53 case by having a closer look at @xmath10 processes , and focus on the cp non - eigenstate @xmath11 case . here",
    "we have to deal with interference effects between cabibbo - favoured and doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath9-meson decays , which lead to certain complications @xcite .",
    "we point out that @xmath15 can nevertheless be determined in a powerful and essentially unambiguous way from the time - dependent @xmath54k_{\\rm s(l)}$ ] , @xmath55\\eta^ { ( ' ) } , d[\\to f_{\\rm ne}]\\phi , ... $ ]  rates with the help of simple `` untagged '' measurements of the corresponding @xmath43 , @xmath44 processes .",

    "this strategy can be implemented with the help of transparent formulae in an _ analytical _ manner .",
    "decays of the kind @xmath56 , @xmath57  also exhibit interesting features , but they appear not to be as attractive for the extraction of @xmath15 as their @xmath58 counterparts , since they have a different ckm structure .    for the testing of the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa mechanism of cp violation @xcite , it is essential to measure @xmath15 in a variety of ways .",
    "in particular , it will be very interesting to compare the theoretically clean values for @xmath15 obtained with the help of the new strategies proposed here with the results that will be provided by other approaches . in this context , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath40 modes are important examples , allowing the extraction of @xmath15 through @xmath61 flavour - symmetry arguments ( for overviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "several theoretically clean strategies were also proposed , employing various different pure tree - diagram - like @xmath0 decays ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite@xcite ) . in general , these approaches are either conceptually simple but experimentally very challenging , or do not allow transparent extractions of @xmath15 through simple analytical expressions , thereby also complicating things considerably and yielding multiple discrete ambiguities .",
    "alternative approaches to extract weak phases from neutral @xmath58 modes can be found in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : evol - ampl ] , we introduce a convenient notation and discuss the time evolution and amplitude structure of neutral @xmath0-meson decays caused by @xmath41 and @xmath62 transitions . in section  [ sec : cp ]",
    ", we then turn to the case where the neutral @xmath9 mesons are observed through decays into cp eigenstates @xmath12 , whereas we shall focus on the interesting opposite case , where the @xmath9 mesons are observed through decays into cp non - eigenstates @xmath13 , in section  [ sec : cpne ] .",

    "if we require that @xmath68 be a cp - self - conjugate state , i.e.  satisfies @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 may both decay into the same state @xmath72 , thereby leading to interference effects between @xmath70@xmath71 mixing and decay processes .",
    "let us illustrate this abstract but quite efficient notation by giving a few examples :    * @xmath73 : @xmath3 @xmath74 ; @xmath4  @xmath75 . * @xmath76 : @xmath6 @xmath75 ; @xmath7  @xmath74 .",
    "all these decays are governed by the colour - suppressed tree - diagram - like topologies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bqdf ] . in the case of @xmath77 ,",
    "also exchange topologies may contribute .",
    "however , these contributions do not modify the phase structure of the corresponding decay amplitudes discussed in subsection  [ subsec : ampl ] , since they enter with the same ckm factors as the colour - suppressed tree topologies .",
    "the @xmath78 mode has already been observed by the belle , cleo and babar collaborations , with branching ratios at the @xmath79 level @xcite .",
    "interestingly , also the observation of the @xmath80 channel was very recently announced by the belle collaboration @xcite , measuring the branching ratio @xmath81 .",
    "if both a @xmath70 and a @xmath71 meson may decay into the same final state @xmath82 , as is the case for the modes specified above , we obtain the following time - dependent rate asymmetry @xcite : @xmath83,\\label{ee6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the time - dependent decay rates for initially , i.e.  at time @xmath86 , present @xmath70 and @xmath71 states , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the mass and decay width differences of the @xmath89 mass eigenstates , respectively .",

    ", we could distinguish between the two solutions @xmath229 and @xmath230 , which are suggested by a recent analysis of cp violation in @xmath40 .",
    "similar comments apply to the @xmath231 analysis performed in @xcite . *",
    "although the @xmath76 modes @xmath232 and @xmath233  provide interesting determinations of @xmath234 and @xmath26 , respectively , as pointed out in @xcite , decays of this kind are not very attractive for the determination of @xmath15 . in the case of @xmath210 f_d$ ] , we have furthermore to deal with the @xmath159 effects .",
    "it is nevertheless important to make efforts to measure the corresponding observables .",
    "in particular , they may even be dominated by the @xmath220 terms , and would then allow us to extract @xmath159 and @xmath161 in a very simple manner .",
    "these quantities could then be used as an input for the extraction of @xmath15 from the @xmath210 f_s$ ] channels .    following these lines",
    ", @xmath128 decays provide very interesting tools to explore cp violation .",
    "moreover , we may obtain valuable insights into the hadron dynamics of the corresponding @xmath0- and @xmath9-meson decays .",
    "consequently , we strongly encourage detailed experimental studies .",
    "since we are dealing with colour - suppressed @xmath0 decays , exhibiting branching ratios at the @xmath235 level in the @xmath73 case , these strategies appear to be particularly interesting for the next generation of dedicated @xmath0 experiments , lhcb and btev , as well as those at super-@xmath0 factories .",
    "however , first important steps may already be achieved at the present @xmath0-decay facilities , i.e.  at babar , belle and run ii of the tevatron .",
