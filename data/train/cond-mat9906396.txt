    "in recent years considerable amount of interest has been focused on the problem of the acoustic wave and heat absorption by a 2deg in gaas / algaas - heterostructures in the quantum hall regime ( qhr ) @xcite .",
    "this is connected with the search for a new way to study the fundamental properties of a 2deg in a strong magnetic field ( which is considered to be perpendicular to the layer , i.e. , @xmath4 ) employing nonequilibrium phonons @xcite or surface acoustic waves @xcite as an experimental tool .",
    "the basic idea is associated with the fact that the energies of phonons generated by heated metal films @xcite or the energy of coherent phonons in semiconductor superlattices @xcite may be of the order of the characteristic gaps in the 2deg spectrum . at the same time , it is well - known that in the qhr a change of the landau level ( ll ) filling factor @xmath5 may drastically renormalize the 2deg excitation spectrum",
    ". therefore parameters such as the phonon life - time ( plt ) @xmath6 , the attenuation , and the velocity of sound waves exhibit strong oscillations as functions of the applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these spectrum alterations prevent development of an universal approach to the theoretical problem of sound and heat absorption by 2deg .",
    "most of the relevant treatments@xcite use the one - particle approximation , i.e. the coulomb electron ",
    "electron ( @xmath7-@xmath7 ) interaction is neglected or considered as a secondary phenomenon renormalizing the phonon displacement field ( screening in ref . ) or one - electron state density ( coulomb gap in ref . ) . in these studies",
    "the ll width is determined by the amplitude @xmath8 of the smooth random potential ( srp ) , and the phonon absorption occurs through the transition of an electron from one semiclassical trajectory to another in the srp field near the percolation threshold@xcite ( when @xmath5 is close to a half - integer ) or by the electron variable - range hopping for strongly localized electrons@xcite ( @xmath5 is close to an integer ) .",
    "the one - particle approximation is evidently justified in a qualitative sense as long as the number of charged quasiparticles is rather large , which does not hold in the integer ( or  almost \" integer ) qhr . in this latter case",
    "one should take into account a strong @xmath7-@xmath7 interaction with the typical energy equal to the coulomb energy @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the dielectric constant , @xmath11 is the magnetic length ) , which exceeds 100k for @xmath12 t . since we have @xmath13 and because of the absence of charged quasiparticles in the ground state , it is exactly @xmath14 that determines the real ll width in the integer qhr .",
    "charge excitations are separated from the ground state , not only by the gap , which is equal to the zeeman energy for odd @xmath5 or the cyclotron energy @xmath15 for even @xmath5 , but also by an additional energy of order @xmath14 .",
    "this applies also to the so - called skyrmion charge excitations@xcite , which seem to have been observed@xcite at @xmath16 .",
    "however , if @xmath5 deviates from unity then even the ground state has to be realized as a complex spin and charge texture in the form of a skyrme crystal with a characteristic period proportional to @xmath17 ( see refs . ) , so that ignoring the skyrmions is only permissible for @xmath5 close enough to unity .",
    "experiments@xcite indicate that this can indeed be done if @xmath18 .",
    "therefore in integer qhr the phonon absorption by chargeless excitations has to be more efficient .",
    "the spectrum calculation for low energy excitations from the filled ll is fortunately an exactly solvable problem to first order in @xmath19 , which is considered to be small ( see refs . ) .",
    "we will study the odd @xmath5 only , since at even @xmath5 the cyclotron gap for excitations substantially exceeds the possible acoustic phonon energy .",
    "for @xmath20 when the @xmath21-th ll in the ground state has a fully occupied lower spin sublevel and an empty upper one the lowest states in the spectrum are spin excitons , which are in fact spin wave excitations . we will call these simply spin waves ( sws ) . for them",
    "the gap is @xmath22k / t , because @xmath23 for gaas . at temperatures",
    "@xmath24 an appreciable amount of  thermal \" sws forms a rarefied 2d bose gas , since sw density is still far less than the density of electrons in the @xmath21-th ll ( i.e. , than @xmath25 ) . as a result , the electron ",
    "phonon ( @xmath7-@xmath26 ) interaction can be represented as the sw ",
    "phonon interaction .",
    "such a representation for the @xmath7-@xmath26 interaction hamiltonian has already been found earlier@xcite ( see also sec . 2 of the present paper ) , and",
    "as discussed it includes , in addition to spin - independent terms , the small terms arising from the electron so coupling .",
    "precisely the latter ones determine the phonon absorption at @xmath27 .",
    "we consider two channels of inelastic phonon scattering .",
    "the first one ( sec .",
    "3 of the present paper ) does not change the 2deg spin state .",
    "the rate of phonon absorption is proportional to the conserved number of equilibrium sws and vanishes when @xmath0 goes to zero .",
    "therefore , as the 2deg temperature due to phonon absorption increases the sws chemical potential has to decrease in this case . after averaging with a certain phonon distribution over the momenta we find the mean effective inverse plt @xmath28 , and hence the rate of the 2deg heating as well as the corresponding contribution to the inverse thermal conductivity .",
    "the transition to the limit @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the phonon wave vector ) allows one to find the ",
    "2d \" contribution to the bulk and surface acoustic wave attenuation . in this last case the piezoelectric electron",
    " lattice interaction plays the main role .    the second phonon absorption channel ( sec .",
    "4 ) arises from the so coupling .",
    "it describes the sw generation from the 2deg ground state .",
    "absorption of a single phonon reduces by 1 both the spin component @xmath31 and the total electron - spin number @xmath32 . as a consequence ,",
    "the absorption rate is proportional to the rate of spin momentum decrease .",
    "this channel of scattering which is pinched off for energies less than the zeeman energy gap , is only accessible for a selected group of  resonant \" phonons with a certain kinematic relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath34 wave vector components .",
    "of course , the long - range wave limit is meaningless in this case .",
    "while the phonons of the resonant group occupy a comparatively small phase volume in @xmath35-space , their contribution to the effective inverse plt is rather significant and , being independent of temperature , can exceed the corresponding contribution from the first absorption channel even at @xmath36k .    in section 5",
    "we consider both absorption channels in the problem of dynamic quasi - equilibrium in a 2deg under the condition of ballistic phonon pumping .",
    "we find the dependence of the final temperature as well as the spin momentum of the 2deg on the initial temperature of the 2deg and the density of the nonequilibrium phonons .",
    "we note in passing that the 2deg adds a small correction to the bulk phonon scattering , connected mainly with the lattice defects and sample boundaries .",
    "one can also get only a small ( although peculiar ) 2deg correction to the thermal conductance@xcite .",
    "the 2deg contribution to the phonon absorption always contains the factor @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the sample thickness in the @xmath39 direction ) in the expression for the value of @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the distribution of the nonequilibrium phonons in @xmath35-space and the amplitude of the sound wave in the 2d channel , which are determined by the acoustic - phonon scattering , to be known .",
    "in closing this section we should like to mention the srp role specifically in the case of the studied problem .",
    "the ground state in the clean limit with strictly odd @xmath5 , being built of one - electron states of the fully occupied lower spin sublevel ( see refs . ) , is actually the same as for the 2deg without coulomb interaction .",
    "accordingly , the ground state in the presence of srp is of the same nature .",
    "note that the srp would give rise to free charged quasiparticles , were it not that the loss in energy due to interaction ( which is on the order of @xmath41 ) , was vastly in excess of the gain @xmath8 in energy due to fluctuations in the random potential@xcite .",
    "we have no free quasiparticles at temperatures @xmath42 , and such a 2deg is a spin dielectric .",
    "furthermore the neutral spin exciton with 2d momentum @xmath43 has a dipole momentum @xmath44 ( see refs . ) and in srp the exciton may gain an energy on order @xmath45 in the dipole approximation , where @xmath46 is srp correlation length .",
    "the associated loss is the  kinetic \" energy @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the excitonic mass@xcite ) .",
    "therefore for @xmath49 one has to take into account the srp effect on the sw energy .",
    "our approach to the phonon absorption by the equilibrium sws ignores the presence of srp in the system , so it is only correct for temperatures @xmath50mk ( this estimate has been done for @xmath51 t , @xmath52mev , and @xmath53 nm ) .",
    "in this section we introduce the so - called ` excitonic representation ' of the hamiltonian , and its eigenstates , describing the 2deg under consideration .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be annihilation operators for an electron in the landau gauge state @xmath56 at the lower and upper spin sublevels , respectively . here",
    "@xmath57 is the size of the 2d system , and @xmath58 is the @xmath21-th harmonic oscillator function . in the `` one - exciton''approximation , the absorption of one phonon which is not accompanied by a change in the spin state of the 2deg amounts to a transition between the one - spin - wave states of the 2deg .",
    "the one - spin - wave state with 2d momentum @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60 here the creation operator for sw , @xmath61 operates on the 2deg ground state @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the number of magnetic flux quanta , or equivalently , the number of electrons in the @xmath21-th ll . the equations @xmath64 may be regarded as the definition for @xmath62 .",
    "the main aspect of the excitonic representation is that the state ( 2.1 ) is an eigenstate of the full electron hamiltonian @xmath65 involving the @xmath7-@xmath7 interaction : @xmath66    ( @xmath67 is the 2deg ground state energy and @xmath68 is the sw energy ) . of course , this is valid to first order in @xmath69 and in the 2d limit ( we assume that @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the bohr radius in the material and @xmath72 is the effective 2deg thickness ) . in the limit @xmath73 appropriate to our problem one may use the quadratic approximation for the excitonic energy , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 ^ 2                     \\eqno ( 2.6)\\ ] ] ( @xmath77 is the @xmath21-th order laguerre polynomial ) , which is defined in terms of the fourier components @xmath78 of the coulomb potential in the heterostructure averaged over the 2deg thickness@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath79 holds , besides our results depend on the ll number @xmath21 only because the excitonic mass ( 2.6 ) depends on @xmath21 .",
    "the excitonic representation for the interacting hamiltonian involves the displacement operators : @xmath80 the identities in ( 2.3 ) can be rewritten in the excitonic representation as @xmath81    the operator in eq .",
