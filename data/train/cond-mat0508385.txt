    "<S> [ sig_n ] one can see that in the considered model with correlated hopping of electrons the conductivity provided by carriers in upper subband is lower than the conductivity , provided by carriers from upper subband . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was discussed in work  @xcite , it is a manifestation of the electron - hole asymmetry , inherent to real transition metal compounds . </S>",

    "<S> if electron concentration increase , the decrease of magnetization leads to the increase of conductivity , @xmath1 approaches its value in paramagnetic state . at the same time , </S>",
    "<S> due to the changes in the correlation band narrowing and the shift of subband center , the position of conductivity maximum changes from @xmath70 in saturated ferromagnetic state ( fig  [ sig_nh ] , 2 ) to @xmath71 in ferromagnetic state ( fig  [ sig_nh ] , 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the change of conductivity with increase of the applied field can be very sharp at low temperature , ( fig  [ sig_h ] , solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of temperature leads to the decrease of @xmath1 and its changes become more smooth . </S>",
    "<S> plateau of @xmath72 dependence signifies , that at low temperatures the fully polarized state is reached in very low field . </S>",

    "<S> [ sig_tet ] ) .    in the framework of the considered model one </S>",
    "<S> can naturally introduce the notions of `` wide '' ( lower ) and `` narrow '' ( upper ) energy bands and , correspondingly , `` light '' and `` heavy '' current carriers with the effective masses @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the energy spectrum of current carriers in lower ( @xmath75 ) band , @xmath76 is the energy spectrum of current carriers in upper ( @xmath77 ) subband .    </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained that effective mass of heavy carriers can increase substantially with the increase of electron concentration . because of the correlated hopping the heavy carriers can be realized in lower ( @xmath75 ) subband as well . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to note that the notion `` effective mass of current carrier '' has conditional sense , different from the standard one , used in band theory . </S>",

    "<S> then @xmath82 and @xmath83 are effective masses of respective transitions ; for the cases when subbands are almost empty or almost full , @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be interpreted as effective masses of electronic and hole states .    </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath51 , then for @xmath89 we have translational motion of doublons ( `` extra electrons '' ) with masses @xmath90 , and for @xmath91 we have the effective mass of holes @xmath92 . from these results one can see that the effective mass of carrier in upper band can differ substantially from the effective masses in the case when the conductivity is due to @xmath75-transitions . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that passing from the regime of conductivity provided by the carriers in lower band to the regime when it is provided by @xmath77-transitions , the effective mass increase stepwise at the point @xmath69 ( the behavior of the effective mass dependence on the electron concentration is shown in fig .  [ m_eff ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass dependence on the magnetization and external magnetic field is shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ m_m ] and [ m_h ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> rise of magnetization leads to the rise of difference in effective masses of spin - up and spin - down current carriers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ m_m ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the dependencies @xmath93 changes with the rise of @xmath94 , too . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the decrease of overall transport in ferromagnetic state , though effective masses of carrier with majority becomes lower . </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in fig .  [ m_m ] qualitatively agree with the corresponding plot of work  @xcite , where gutzwiller approximation has been used to calculate effective masses of current carriers . </S>",

    "<S> the single - electron green function and quasiparticle energy spectrum of the model have been calculated using a variant of generalized hartree - fock approximation . </S>",

    "<S> we have found that in the ground state the saturated ferromagnetic state is stable while at non - zero temperature magnetization has the concentration dependence which agrees with work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior of magnetization leads to @xmath97 dependence with maxima at quarter and three - quarter fillings in distinction from paramagnetic ones , obtained in work  @xcite . at non - zero temperatures the sharp changes of @xmath97 dependence are possible . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to complicated character of temperature dependence of band narrowing factor . </S>",
