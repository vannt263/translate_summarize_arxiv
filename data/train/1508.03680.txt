    "the main issue is that the number of fundamental surfaces of a given genus , and even the number of vertex fundamental surfaces , can be exponential in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a second difficulty in applying normal surfaces is that an incompressible surface may not be fundamental , so that one must also count all haken sums of normal surfaces that can result in a given genus @xcite .",
