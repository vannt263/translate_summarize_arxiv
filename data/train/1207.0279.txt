    "knot theory now comes to the avant - scene of theoretical physics .",
    "this was anticipated long ago @xcite , because it actually studies the wilson loop averages in a simplified ( topological ) version of yang - mills theory , and is supposed to play the same crucially important role for generic yang - mills studies as topological strings play for the full string theory . in the underlying @xmath2 chern - simons theory",
    "@xcite many non - trivial effects are already present , including sophisticated perturbation theory , non - perturbative effects and various dualities : just because of the topological nature they can be sometime simplified and even eliminated by the gauge choices .",
    "what is new today : a tremendous amount of `` experimental '' data is available at @xcite about the wilson loop averages ( called homfly polynomials @xcite within the chern - simons context ) . also effective theoretical methods",
    "are developed to calculate these quantities based on studies of last years in adjacent fields : group theory , matrix models , conformal theories and agt relations .",
    "these advances led to a discovery of vast net of interrelations between different homfly polynomials including : various difference equations @xcite , the amm / eo topological recursion @xcite and even some traces of integrability @xcite , which now need to be systematized , understood and converted into more standard forms common for other branches of science .",
    "all this gives a new vim to the study of old , but partly abandoned subjects like racah coefficients for quantum groups and character expansions .",
    "today , generic simple formulas are known for the homfly polynomials for all the 2,3,4-strand knots and links in the fundamental representation @xcite ; to write them down it turned sufficient to know the representation theory of @xmath3 , where the racah coefficients are well known @xcite and were widely used in other physical applications . in this letter",
    "we report the extension of these results to the @xmath4- , @xmath5- and @xmath6-strand cases , where @xmath0 representation theory ( and its simple evident generalization ) is needed .",
    "per se _ of these racah coefficients will be described in a separate paper @xcite ; what is important , this calculation confirms the universal ansatz suggested in @xcite , which now seems relatively safe to use for @xmath7 strands as well , this will be done elsewhere . note that * the single @xmath5-strand formula ( [ 6str ] ) * , explicitly written in the present paper , * is sufficient to describe _ all _ the content of the rolfsen tables @xcite * concerning the homfly polynomials in the fundamental representation .",
    "moreover , it is sufficient to describe the homfly polynomials of almost all knots in @xcite , since all the tables are restricted to no more than 12 crossings , and all such knots , except just 17 , admit the 6-strand braid representation at most .",
    "the remaining 17 knots ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ; @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; @xmath23 . ] require the @xmath6-strand calculation which was also done with an evident generalization of the racah coefficients to the @xmath24 young diagram [ 4,1,1,1 ] in ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) .    according to @xcite ,",
