    "in a quite recent paper , berim and ruckenstein @xcite have reported symmetry breaking of the density profile of fluid argon ( ar ) confined in a planar slit with identical walls of carbon dioxide ( co@xmath0 ) .",
    "these authors claimed that a completely symmetric integral equation provides an asymmetric profile which has a lower free energy than that of the lowest symmetric solution leading to a symmetry breaking phenomenon .",
    "it was assumed that the ar atoms interact via a standard lennard - jones ( lj ) potential characterized by the strength @xmath1 and the atomic diameter @xmath2 .",
    "the presented results were obtained from calculations carried out with the smoothed density approximation ( sda ) version @xcite of the nonlocal density functional theory ( dft ) in the case of a closed planar slit with an effective width of @xmath3 .",
    "the symmetry breaking was found for temperatures between the experimental triple point for ar , @xmath4 k , and a critical value @xmath5 k. at each temperature , it was determined a range of average densities @xmath6 where the symmetry breaking occurs , outside this range a symmetric profile has the lowest free energy .    as a matter of fact , the adsorption of fluid ar on a solid substrate of co@xmath0 was intensively studied for several decades ( see , e.g. , refs .   and ) . in 1977",
    "ebner and saam @xcite analyzed phase transitions by assuming that atoms of the fluid interact with the solid wall via a 9 - 3 van der walls potential ( from here on denoted as es potential ) obtained from the assumption that ar atoms interact with co@xmath0 molecules via a lj interaction with parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "after this pioneering work , a large amount of work has been devoted to study this system with different numerical and analytical techniques .",
    "the attention was focused to analyze features like : the oscillatory behavior of the density profile which leads to a layered structure in the neighborhood of the flat substrate ; the thin- to thick - film transitions ; wetting properties and prewetting jumps .",
    "berim and ruckenstein @xcite have also adopted the es potential , however , a hard - wall repulsion was introduced in their calculations . in practice , such a hard wall diminishes the strength of the solid - fluid interaction .",
    "the investigation of symmetry breaking in physical systems is a very exciting issue .",
    "this is due to the fact that such a feature may have fundamental theoretical implications . in many fields of physics the discovery of symmetry breaking lead to significant advances in the theory .",
    "therefore it is important to place the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the current knowledge about adsorption into planar slits .",
    "asymmetric solutions for fluids confined in slits have been previously reported in the literature .",
    "about 20 years ago a dutch collaboration has carried out calculations on the delft molecular dynamics processor ( dmdp ) , which was specially designed for molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of simple fluids @xcite .",
    "the results were published in a series of papers by sikkenk et al .",
    "@xcite and nijmeijer et al . @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed for a canonical ensemble with two types of particles , 2904 of one type for building a solid substrate and several thousand of the other type for composing the fluid adsorbate .",
    "the temperature of the system was kept at @xmath9 which is in between the fluid s triple - point temperature @xmath10 and the critical temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the width of the slit was taken as @xmath12 , supposing that this distance be enough large to avoid any capillary effect .",
    "such a system can support solid - liquid ( sl ) , solid - vapor(sv ) , and liquid - vapor ( lv ) interfaces .",
    "these authors have studied wetting at lv coexistence by varying over a wide range the relative strength of the solid - fluid and fluid - fluid interactions defined by the ratio @xmath13 of the lj parameters .",
    "the length scale of this interaction was taken as @xmath14 . for increasing @xmath15 from @xmath16 towards @xmath17 three cases",
    "were observed :    \\(i ) at low @xmath15 , _ symmetric _ profiles consisting of two sv interfaces and two lv interfaces are obtained , this situation corresponds to a complete wall drying as can be seen in fig .  1 of @xcite ;    \\(ii ) at intermediate @xmath15 ,",
    "_ asymmetric _ profiles consisting of a sl , a lv , and a sv interface are obtained , here the wall attraction is sufficiently strong to produce a partial wetting , i.e. , to support a rather thick film on one wall while a sv interface is present near the other wall , this feature is shown in fig .  2 of @xcite ;    \\(iii ) for the largest @xmath15 , _",
    "symmetric _ profiles consisting of two sl interfaces and two lv interfaces are obtained , now the strength is enough to wet both walls as can be seen in fig.3 of @xcite .",
    "the structure of the profiles mentioned above depends on the balance of the involved surface tensions @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 which are related by the young s law ( see , e.g. , eq.(2.1 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the contact angle .",
    "the latter quantity is defined as the angle between the wall and the interface between the liquid and the vapor ( see fig . 1 in ref .",
    "the transition from ( i ) to ( ii ) takes place at the drying point @xmath23 , whereas the transition from ( ii ) to ( iii ) takes place at the wetting point @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth of notice that velasco and tarazona @xcite have carried out calculations in the framework of the sda obtaining density profiles with the same structure to that reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "the reader may look at ref .",
    "@xcite for a further comparison between md and dft results .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to acquire a more accurate picture of the symmetry breaking reported in ref . .",
    "in so doing , we explore size effects by comparing the results obtained for slits of widths @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "next , we investigate the existence of stable asymmetric solutions for the density profiles when the position of the hard - wall repulsion introduced in ref .   is changed . when the location of this hard wall is moved , the strength of the adsorption potential is varied allowing a connection to the studies described in refs .  .",

    "the variation of @xmath101 is performed in such a way that the effective width of the slit is always kept at @xmath170 , hence , only the potential is slightly changed mainly near the walls . at this point the temperature was still kept at @xmath146 k. it was found that for increasing values of @xmath101 the range of average density @xmath130 where there are symmetry breaking decreases .",
    "this effect might be observed in successive plots of @xmath182 , however , we prefer to report directly the evolution of the parameter @xmath168 .",

    "figure [ fig : asymm_1932 ] shows the asymmetry parameter @xmath168 as a function of the factor @xmath101 for the average density @xmath181 .",
    "these data indicate that the asymmetric solution already disappears for a critical value @xmath184 .",
    "the evolution of the density profiles from asymmetric to symmetric species is displayed if fig.[fig : rho_asymm_1932 ] . in this drawing",
    "one may observe the diffusion of fluid argon from the neighborhood of the left wall towards the right one .",
    "this process continues until a symmetric density profile is formed for @xmath185 .",
    "the described evolution of @xmath186 is determined by the behavior of the surface tensions .",
    "if one uses the young s law given in eq.([young ] ) the total surface excess energy of asymmetric profiles may be written as @xmath187 with @xmath188 . by increasing enough the attraction the equality @xmath189",
    "is reached yielding @xmath190 , then the system undergoes to a transition to a symmetric profile with @xmath191 in this case both walls of the slit are wet .",
    "let us now look if something special is going on for the adsorption potential at @xmath192 . as a matter of fact , it becomes important to explore where the hard - wall repulsion introduced in ref .",
    "is located for such a critical value .",
    "the position of the left hard - wall repulsion with respect to the real wall according to fig.[fig : potential ] is given by @xmath193 for a slit of effective width @xmath170 the minimum of the total adsorption potential given by eq .",
    "( [ snilson ] ) is to a very good approximation determined by the minimum of the es potential exerted by the left wall .",
    "it is located at @xmath194 the ratio of these quantities becomes @xmath195 since this ratio is larger than unity , it indicates that for @xmath196 the minimum of the es potential is reached inside the slit .",
    "we also analyzed the occurrence of asymmetric solutions for @xmath197 at temperatures @xmath198 k. it was also found that the symmetry breaking disappears at some critical value of @xmath101 .",
    "such a behavior may be expected if one takes into account that for temperatures larger than @xmath146 k even for @xmath144 the range @xmath6 is smaller ( see fig .",
    "5 of ref .  ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that a reliable _ ab - initio _ potential utilized by mistura _",
    "@xcite for investigating the adsorption of ar on co@xmath0 exhibits an even stronger attraction than the es potential",
    ". this feature can be observed in fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "hence , one would not expect any symmetry breaking in the case of such a realistic adsorption potential .",
    "we reexamined the symmetry breaking found very recently by berim and ruckenstein @xcite in a study of the adsorption of argon in a closed slit with identical walls of carbon dioxide .",
    "it is important to stress that these authors have introduced hard - wall repulsions at distances @xmath199 from the real walls of the slit as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ( see also fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , reducing in such a way the strength of the adopted es potential .",
    "stable asymmetric solutions were obtained in the case of a slit with effective width @xmath200 for temperatures in the range @xmath201  k.    the present study was mainly devoted to establish how robust are the asymmetric solutions against changes of the adsorption potential . however , in addition , the behavior of the asymmetry parameter was also evaluated for slits of different widths .",
    "the calculations have been carried out using the same nonlocal formalism as that adopted in ref .  ,",
    "namely , the sda density functional theory proposed by tarazona @xcite .    since in a pioneering series of works a dutch collaboration",
    "have previously found the symmetry breaking by studying adsorption in a slit of width @xmath169 , see refs .  , we performed a comparison of the asymmetry parameter @xmath168 evaluated for slits of @xmath202 and @xmath171 at @xmath146 k. the difference between the results is rather small .",
    "further calculations showed that the effect due to confinement begins to be important for slits with @xmath203 .    focusing the analysis on the slit of @xmath170 , in a rather complete plot of @xmath204",
    "we show clearly the regime where the symmetry breaking occurs and , in addition , we also display the lagrange multiplier @xmath28 for a cc like solution .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the spacial shape of the obtained solutions correspond to the three sorts of profiles discussed in refs .",
    "the strength of the attraction determines which one of that profiles is the stable solution .    by shifting the hard - wall repulsions introduced by berim and ruckenstein @xcite towards the real walls the strength of the attraction",
    "is increased producing changes in the balance of surface tensions .",
    "it was found that at @xmath146  k already for the critical distance @xmath205 the asymmetric solutions disappear . at this temperature ,",
    "close to the triple point , the asymmetry parameter @xmath168 reached its largest values in the study of ref .  .",
    "for higher temperatures the symmetry breaking disappears even more rapidly .",
    "finally we can state that from the present study it is possible to conclude that the symmetry breaking reported in ref .",
    "can be understood in terms of findings described in refs .",
    "@xcite . by locating hard - wall repulsions the authors of ref .",
    "diminish the attraction of the es adsorption potential exerted on the fluid causing the entrance of the system in a @xmath159-@xmath160-@xmath161 regime ( asymmetric profiles ) corresponding to fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite . by moving the hard - wall repulsions towards the real walls the attraction increases monotonically causing eventually the entrance of the system in the @xmath162-@xmath163-@xmath161 regime with symmetric solution of the type displayed in fig .  3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a reliable _ ab - initio _ potential for the interaction of fluid ar with a structureless smooth wall of co@xmath0 like that adopted by mistura _",
    "@xcite is even stronger than the es one .",
    "therefore , it is possible to infer that no symmetry breaking would be expeted for real ar / co@xmath0 systems .",
