    "thanks to impressive progress on the experimental side , many small- and medium - scale quantum devices are now ready for applications ranging from quantum metrology @xcite to quantum simulation @xcite . with quantum information processing as one of the driving but long - term goals ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "one of the pressing questions is , what can one do with these devices _ now _ ?",
    "this problem clearly falls into the remit of _ quantum systems and control engineering _ , an area naturally receiving increased interest @xcite both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "control theory offers a well - known characterization of the operations that a quantum device is capable of on _ lie - algebraic _ grounds  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we simplify the question to the _ hamiltonian membership problem _ of ( finite - dimensional ) quantum simulation .",
    "it amounts to deciding , for a set of _ given control interactions _ @xmath0 , whether a set of _ effective target interactions _ @xmath1 can be simulated  without having to establish controllability via nested ( and hence tedious ) commutator calculations for the so - called lie closure .",
    "our results reduce the hamiltonian membership problem to the straightforward solution of homogeneous linear equations .    in the setting of the controlled schrdinger equation  @xcite ( taken as a bilinear control system @xcite ) @xmath2\\ , u(t),\\ ] ]",
    "we ask whether the given set @xmath3 of interactions ( which may include a drift term ) generates an effective interaction @xmath4 or more generally any interaction from a set @xmath5 assuming all @xmath6 are represented by hermitian matrices henceforth .",
    "if so , then for _ every _ evolution time @xmath7 of a _ simulated interaction @xmath8 _ , there is a solution @xmath9 of the _ simulating system _ for @xmath10 and controls @xmath11 such that @xmath0 generates a unitary @xmath12 in the simulation time @xmath13 starting from the identity at @xmath14 @xcite , .",
    "can be infinite in order to also cover peculiar cases such as an irrational winding of a torus .",
    "note that the hamiltonian evolution is _ not _ necessarily simulated continuously during a time interval , but we only assume that the correct total evolution @xmath15 is attained after a suitably chosen duration @xmath13 which may depend on the arbitrary but _ fixed _ evolution time @xmath16 . ] in this sense , hamiltonian simulation of a particular hamiltonian @xmath17 can be considered as an infinitesimal version of creating a particular unitary gate",
    ". it also generalizes the universality ( or full controllability ) question of whether _ all _ hamiltonians can be simulated ( or equivalently whether _ all _ unitary gates can be obtained ) @xcite . in the context of gates",
    ", a familiar elementary example is that all unitary gates in an @xmath18-qubit system can be obtained @xcite by combining local gates with cnot gates .",
    "however , the approach of the pioneering age of decomposing every target gate into a sequence of cnot and local gates is , in practice , all too often imprecise or slow .",
    "so implementing gates or simulating hamiltonians with high fidelity rather asks for optimal control techniques , as explained in a recent roadmap  @xcite . as a precondition , here we step back to the hamiltonian level and give criteria for simulability and controllability .",
    "we solve the decision problems of simulability ( and controllability ) by just analyzing the symmetries of the hamiltonians of given setups .",
    "we show that this decision requires considering both _ linear and quadratic symmetries _ , where linear symmetries of a hamiltonian @xmath19 commute with @xmath19 , while _",
    "quadratic symmetries _ of @xmath19 are those commuting with the tensor square @xmath20 .",
    "the term quadratic symmetry is motivated , since the tensor square generates @xmath21 just as @xmath22 generates the unitary  @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , our goal is to get a symmetry - based understanding of how a set @xmath0 of available interactions can simulate a set @xmath1 of desired effective quantum interactions in the sense that the lie closures coincide , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "we circumvent brute - force calculation of the lie closure not only because high - order commutators can entail a significant growth in the appearing matrix entries and may lead to instabilities in numerical computations , but first and foremost because it provides no deeper insight into the problem .",
    "our symmetry analysis leads to a much more systematic understanding of hamiltonian simulation and quantum system dynamics in general .",
    "it provides a powerful argument to decide under which conditions a desired hamiltonian can , in fact , be simulated , or in turn , which explicit simulations or computations are impossible in a given experimental setup .",
    "let us summarize our line of thought : as short - hand , let the _ linear symmetries _ of @xmath0 ( analogously for any set of matrices ) be expressed via the _ commutant _ @xmath25 which consists of all matrices @xmath26 that commute ( i.e. , @xmath27=0 $ ] ) with each element @xmath28 of @xmath0 .",
    "denotes the set of complex @xmath29 matrices and @xmath30 signifies the @xmath29 identity matrix . ] obviously , for @xmath1 to be simulable by @xmath0 , it is necessary that @xmath1 may not break but rather has to inherit the symmetries of @xmath0 , so @xmath31 = \\dim[({\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{p}}}{\\cup } { \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{q}}})']$ ] .",
    "however , a complete symmetry characterization is nontrivial .",
    "it rather requires the following two steps : the first is to introduce _ quadratic _",
    "symmetries  @xcite as those linear symmetries of the system artificially doubled by the _ tensor square _ @xmath32 .",
    "it defines the _ quadratic symmetries _ by its commutant @xmath33 . secondly ,",
    "let @xmath34 denote the center   of matrices contains all @xmath35 that commute ( i.e. , @xmath36=0 $ ] ) with every @xmath37 . ] of the commutant @xmath38 and consider the central projections of @xmath0 and @xmath39 onto @xmath34 . with these stipulations , we summarize our main result :    the given interactions @xmath0 simulate the desired interactions @xmath1 in the sense @xmath40 if and only if @xmath0 and @xmath1 share the same _ quadratic _ symmetries ( i.e. , @xmath41 = \\dim[{{({\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{p}}}{\\cup } { \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{q}}})}^{(2)}}]$ ] ) [ condition  ( a ) ] and the central projections of @xmath0 and @xmath42 onto @xmath34 are of the same rank [ condition  ( b ) ] .",
    "let us emphasize that our approach goes beyond the ubiquitous use of linear symmetries in physics , since linear symmetries provide only an incomplete picture of hamiltonian simulation .",
    "the application of higher symmetries is the key here .",
    "it is interesting to note that essentially only the quadratic symmetries ( and no higher ones ) in condition ( a ) are necessary to characterize the dynamics of a quantum system .",
    "one obtains a complete description together with the auxiliary condition ( b ) .",
    "some remarks also summarizing known approaches are in order .",
    "the quadratic symmetries are stronger than the linear ones ; actually they include them and thus condition ( a ) implies that the linear symmetries also agree .",
    "example  [ ex_one ] below illustrates why matching the linear symmetries does not suffice to ensure simulability . as shown in a companion paper  @xcite , one can decide if a subalgebra @xmath43 of a compact semisimple lie algebra @xmath44 actually fulfills @xmath45 ( e.g. , @xmath24 ) just by analyzing quadratic symmetries .",
    "but example  [ ex_two ] elucidates why condition  ( a ) alone does not , in the general compact case , imply simulability . only after fixing the central projections by condition ( b ) the quadratic symmetries decide simulability .    on a much more general scale ,",
    "condition ( b ) closes the gap to completely characterizing equality in @xmath43 now for _ all compact lie algebras _ ( generated by skew - hermitian interactions ) beyond the semisimple ones of @xcite . simplifying within the lie - algebraic frame , our symmetry approach to decide simulability and the membership @xmath46",
    "can thus be seen as a major step beyond the well - established lie - algebra rank condition @xcite and beyond the limited first use of quadratic symmetries to establish full controllability in  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we elaborate our method and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for hamiltonian simulation to arrive at result  [ res_one ] below .",
    "we also describe important properties of linear and quadratic symmetries and discuss two illustrating examples .",
    "example  [ ex_one ] highlights the importance of quadratic symmetries for deciding hamiltonian simulation and their relevance for entanglement invariants .",
    "the necessity for the auxiliary condition ( b ) is made evident in example  [ ex_two ] .",
    "the linear symmetries of @xmath47 are identified @xcite with the commutant @xmath48 given as @xmath49=0 \\,\\text { for all } \\ , m\\in\\mathcal{m}\\}.\\ ] ] the commutant includes all complex multiples of the identity @xmath30 and it forms a vector space of dimension @xmath50 .",
    "a smaller set of matrices typically shows _ more _ symmetries , i.e. , for @xmath51 one has @xmath52 and @xmath53 iff @xmath54 . by jacobi s identity ( i.e. , @xmath55=[[m_2,s],m_1]+[[s , m_1],m_2]$ ] ) , any symmetry @xmath56 that commutes with both @xmath57 and @xmath58 also commutes with their commutator @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "so , @xmath59 and the lie algebra @xmath60 it generates have the same commutant : @xmath61 if @xmath62 .    in our context",
    ", this implies that @xmath4 can not be simulated by @xmath0 unless @xmath63 , i.e. , coinciding symmetries are a necessary but not sufficient condition .",
