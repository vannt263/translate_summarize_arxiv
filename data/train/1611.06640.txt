    "is the so - called all - subset hyperplane arrangement , consisting of all hyperplanes @xmath1 for @xmath2 a proper subset of @xmath3 .",
    "the all - subset hyperplane arrangement is actually known in various areas , but perhaps due to its complexity and the lack of a systematic approach , it has not directly received a concentrated treatment in mathematics .",
    "the all - subset hyperplane arrangement dates back at least to the 1960 s in works of h. araki and d. ruelle on wightman functions and generalized retarded green functions in quantum field theory .",
    "see for example @xcite for an overview .",
    "we study the action of the symmetric group on certain finite - dimensional vector spaces constructed from families of convex polyhedral regions in euclidean space , called * plates*. the vector spaces are the linear spans of the characteristic functions of families of plates .",
    "our main result is a proof of a formula for the characters of the symmetric group that we obtain in this way .",
    "it generalizes a well - known formula in combinatorics , called the worpitzky identity , that from our point of view is obtained combinatorially by evaluating characters on the identity permutation .",
    "it corresponds geometrically to the decomposition of a scaled simplex into unit hypersimplices .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we shall begin by describing the worpitzky identity and relevant surrounding ideas in combinatorics .",
    "then we shall summarize results from @xcite on the essential properties of plates , along with several examples and illustrations . following that we formulate our main result , the character formula , along with some further results .      in @xcite , a. postnikov introduced and studied generalized permutohedra . by @xcite ,",
    "as plates are characteristic functions of cones around faces of permutohedra , it follows from an inclusion / exclusion argument that any generalized permutohedron can be realized from a linear combination of plates with coefficients @xmath4 .",
    "replacing generalized permutohedra with vector spaces of characteristic functions of cones amounts to a categorification .",
    "we study the combinatorics and representation theory of this categorification .",
    "let us point out some subjects in mathematics which are equivalent or related to the theory of plates , along with suggested references .    1 .",
    "matroids and polymatroids . 1 .   plates in hypersimplices @xmath5 are closely related to matroids , as in @xcite . in @xcite ocneanu develops elaborate combinatorial techniques which show how to localize generalized permutohedra to hypersimplices .",
    "it is shown that these localizations are matroid polytopes , and any matroid polytope is a linear combination of such localizations .",
    "2 .   plates in simplices @xmath6 are closely related to polymatroids , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the module of nondegenerate plates about a point is isomorphic to the free lie module . 1 .   in classical representation theory , according to the standard construction one works in the regular representation to obtain the irreducible representations of the symmetric group , by projecting with the young idempotents onto the irreducible submodules .",
    "it is well - known that the regular representation of @xmath7 is the restriction of an @xmath8-module called the * free lie module * , see @xcite .",
    "it is spanned by the @xmath9 alternating binary trees , or bracketings , where each leaf is labeled with an integer @xmath10 , and has basis the @xmath11 `` combed '' antisymmetric trees @xmath12 .",
    "the fundamental observation in @xcite is that the module of plates about a point is isomorphic to the free lie module in brackets of @xmath13 ( distinct ) generators , modulo certain relations coming from plates with fewer lumps . here",
    "@xmath8 acts on the space of complex - linear combinations of plates by permuting variables .",
    "+ here the @xmath8-module of nondegenerate plates has basis the @xmath11 permutations of @xmath14 of the standard plate @xmath15 which has support the cone generated by the simple @xmath16 roots @xmath17 extending out from the point @xmath18 .",
    "note that the @xmath8-action crucially fixes the position of the plate , @xmath18 , which would not be the case for a plate with position @xmath19 , where not all @xmath20 are the same .",
    "3 .   descent statistics for permutations and toric geometry . 1 .   the @xmath8 hypersimplex plate modules @xmath21 are isomorphic to the modules in @xcite which describe the @xmath8-action on the cohomology of a toric variety associated to a coxeter arrangement @xcite . in particular",
    ", the character values for plates in hypersimplices can be obtained as coefficients of the quasi - eulerian symmetric functions which appear in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for the related toric geometry and @xcite for more recent developments .",
    "word - quasi - symmetric functions and calle s mould calculus . 1 .   in @xcite rational functions in @xmath13 formal indeterminants @xmath22",
    "are given to provide a functional model for the so - called word - quasisymmetric functions , wqsym .",
    "these functions , which are given as examples of calle s so - called moulds , are closely related to plates .",
    "details will appear elsewhere .",
    "the eulerian numbers @xmath23 , or @xmath24 in the usual notation , were defined by euler in 1755 .",
    "they count permutations of @xmath3 with @xmath25 ascents and @xmath26 descents .",
    "our notation differs slightly from the standard one in order to emphasize a correspondence with plates in hypersimplices .",
    "the following table starts at the top with @xmath27 and continues in the second row with @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 for example , the third row counts the permutations @xmath30 in 1883 worpitzky discovered an identity which expresses a power as a sum of eulerian numbers with binomial coefficients .",
    "for example , @xmath31 see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the eulerian numbers and many related topics .",
    "we generalize this combinatorial identity to an identity of characters of the symmetric group @xmath8 .",
    "these are characters of plate modules for the simplex and hypersimplices in @xmath13 coordinates .",
    "a detailed paper is in preparation .",
    "from this section on , by a * plate * we shall mean the * characteristic function * of the polyhedral cone defined by a flag of inequalities of the form    @xmath32    where the last line is an equality . here",
    "@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a subset of @xmath35 with @xmath36 real variables and @xmath37 is an ordered set partition and @xmath38 is an ordered partition . in most of what follows",
    "we will assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the sets @xmath41 are called * lumps * @xmath41 and the corresponding integers @xmath20 are called * positions*. we will use the notation @xmath42 to indicate the characteristic function of the region determined by the above equations .        in more detail ,",
    "a plate is the characteristic function of the cone about a face of the permutohedron , the polytope formed by the convex hull of permutations of @xmath43 . in figure",
    "[ fig : standardplates ] the standard nondegenerate plates , i.e. all lumps have size 1 , are given for @xmath44 and @xmath45 as unbounded polyhedral cones generated by simple roots of type @xmath46 respectively @xmath47 .",
    "for example , in the @xmath48 coordinate case on the right , the plate is identified with the region @xmath49 opening toward the vertex @xmath50 .    the permutohedron itself was studied and generalized previously in @xcite . for nondegenerate plates , as in for example figure [ fig : standardplates ] , from the inequalities above",
    "one can verify that the plate is the convex span of a system of simple roots of type @xmath16 .",
    "the nondegenerate plate @xmath51 was essentially studied before in @xcite , where a finite part of it is constructed as the convex hull of the positive roots @xmath52 of type @xmath16 , for @xmath53 .      in @xcite ,",
    "ocneanu establishes fundamental properties of plates .",
    "we shall need a subset of these results , which we reproduce without proof in theorems [ cyclicsum ] , [ standardbasis ] and [ platerelations ] .",
    "let @xmath54 be plates .",
    "we shall say that @xmath55 is a lumping of @xmath56 if for each lump @xmath57 of @xmath55 , @xmath58 is a union of consecutive lumps of @xmath56 and if @xmath59 is the sum of their respective positions .",
    "for example , @xmath60 is a lumping of @xmath61 .",
    "the lumping of @xmath62 and @xmath63 into @xmath64 corresponds to a projection of the ambient simplex along the edge with equation @xmath65 , onto a lower dimensional space parametrized by the variables @xmath66 . under this projection ,",
    "the two simplex vertices labeled with @xmath67 and @xmath45 , which are the endpoints of the projection edge , are identified .    as plates in @xmath13 variables",
    "are characteristic functions of flags of at most @xmath68 inequalities , intersected with a hyperplane @xmath69 , we see now that lumping can be understood geometrically directly in terms of the defining equations .",
    "the lumpings of a plate @xmath56 are obtained from @xmath56 by removing one or more bounding hyperplanes , i.e. we delete a subset of the @xmath70 inequalities which define @xmath56 .    according to theorem [ cyclicsum ] , a plate @xmath56 with @xmath71 lumps determines a decomposition of its ambient space into a sum of the @xmath71 cyclic rotations of @xmath56 which intersect only on their faces .",
    "[ cyclicsum ] let @xmath72 and @xmath73 be given .",
    "let @xmath74 be an ordered set partition of @xmath3 .",
    "then we have the cyclic sum relation @xmath75 @xmath76    in practice , all computations involving plates are made possible by the formula given in theorem [ platerelations ] below .",
    "in particular , theorem [ standardbasis ] provides a basis , and using theorem [ platerelations ] one can build matrices for the action of permutations . to prove our character formula , however , we introduce a basis which is permutation invariant up to a root of unity . using this basis , we parametrize explicitly the diagonal of the matrix of any given permutation , from which it is immediate to obtain its trace .",
    "this basis , the * q - basis * , inspires an interesting algebraic structure which we introduce in definition [ permutohedronalgebra ] .",
    "we come now to some of the main results of @xcite , stated in what follows without proof .",
    "[ standardbasis ] the set of all plates which have @xmath77 in the first lump is linearly independent .",
    "in particular , it is a basis .    in",
    "what follows , we call the basis of theorem [ standardbasis ] the * standard basis*.    in @xcite , ocneanu proves the fundamental theorem [ platerelations ] , giving the module of relations for plates , using homological arguments involving rooted trees .",
    "the proof involves properties of hypergeometric functions of euler beta type for special parameter configurations .",
    "[ platerelations ] let @xmath78 labeled so that @xmath79 .",
    "this expands in the standard basis as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of lumps of @xmath55 and where the sum is over all lumped shuffles @xmath82 of @xmath83 and @xmath84 so that the lumps @xmath85 , i.e. those after @xmath86 , are not lumped together .",
    "we give the lumped shuffle expansions of two plates in the standard basis .",
    "@xmath87    @xmath88 @xmath89    in figure [ fig : platerelations ] two more plate relations are given .",
    "for positive integers @xmath90 with @xmath91 , let @xmath92 and for each @xmath40 let @xmath93 here @xmath5 is the well - known hypersimplex , equivalently realized as the convex hull of permutations of the vector @xmath94 with @xmath95 1 s and @xmath96 0 s .",
    "we denote by @xmath97 and @xmath98 the complex - linear spans of plates which have support in @xmath6 and respectively @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : positionaspolynomial ] illustrates the @xmath44 case for @xmath99 . here , in @xmath44 variables",
    ", there are two kinds of hypersimplices , namely the `` down triangle '' @xmath100 and the `` up triangle '' @xmath101 .",
    "ocneanu shows constructively in @xcite that , in general , @xmath98 is a submodule of @xmath102    the hypersimplex plate @xmath103 is the convex hull of @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the convex hull of @xmath106 .",
    "the plates @xmath107 and @xmath108 are thus identified with @xmath100 and respectively @xmath101 .    in figure [ fig : positionaspolynomial ] , the hypersimplex plates @xmath107 and @xmath108 are translated by the vectors @xmath109 and respectively @xmath110 .",
    "the position data can be conveniently stored using the monomials , or symmetric tensors , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the standard basis for @xmath114 .",
    "[ equivariantworpitzky ] there is an isomorphism of @xmath8 modules @xmath115 where by convention @xmath116 if @xmath117 .",
    "this follows from a straightforward geometric argument together with a result of ocneanu @xcite that @xmath118 the characters of the identity permutation ( hence the dimensions of @xmath119 @xmath120 , and @xmath121 ) satisfy the classical worpitzky identity @xmath122    we have thus * categorified * the classical worpitzky identity .",
    "we replace a positive counting formula with an identity of characters of symmetric group representations , realized concretely as complex linear spaces spanned by characteristic functions of regions called plates .",
    "our vector spaces , however , are tightly constrained .",
    "they capture the `` linear '' properties of quantum field theory , see for example @xcite .",

    "a * basis q - plate * is a q - plate with the sum normalized to have coefficient @xmath128 when @xmath77 is in the first lump , in which case we have the basis q - plate .",

    "there was a conjecture due to ocneanu about the characters of the @xmath8-representation of plates as functions on the simplex @xmath6 .",

    "<S> the vector spaces in the categorification are tightly constrained by certain continuity relations which appeared in physics in the mid 20th century . </S>",
    "<S> we describe here the action of the symmetric group on the vector spaces in this categorification . </S>",
    "<S> generalized permutohedra are replaced by vector spaces of characteristic functions of polyhedral cones about faces of permutohedra , called _ plates _ , due to a. ocneanu . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric group acts on plates by coordinate permutation .    in combinatorics , </S>",
    "<S> the eulerian numbers count the number of permutations with given numbers of ascent and descents . </S>",
    "<S> the classical worpitzky identity expands a power @xmath0 as a sum of eulerian numbers , with binomial coefficients . in our thesis , for the main result </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the classical worpitzky identity to an isomorphism of symmetric group modules , corresponding geometrically to the tiling of a scaled simplex by unit hypersimplices . in the categorification </S>",
    "<S> , the volume of a hypersimplex is replaced by the complex - linear dimension of a vector space associated to it . </S>",
    "<S> the main technical aspect of the proof of the character formula for the simplex involves a partition of unity of a commutative algebra of translations on a discrete torus , and a certain modular diophantine equation .    </S>",
    "<S> a detailed paper is in preparation . </S>"
