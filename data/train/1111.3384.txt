    "<S> in fact , as shown long ago by goddard et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who quantized the ng string in the light - cone gauge , the quantum theory breaks lorentz invariance unless @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> analogous calculations for superstrings lead instead to @xmath1 as the critical dimension . </S>",
    "<S> a ghost - free quantization below the critical dimension is possible but only after the introduction of an additional liouville field on the worldsheet @xcite or other `` longitudinal '' variables @xcite that are absent in the critical dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is an exceptional subcritical dimension for which a unitary gauge quantization preserves lorentz invariance without the need to introduce any additional variables : @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the usual difficulties with the closure of the lorentz algebra are trivially absent for @xmath2 @xcite and a detailed study of closed oriented `` 3d '' strings @xcite shows not only that are there no lorentz anomalies but also that there are no supersymmetry anomalies of the 3d green - schwarz ( gs ) superstrings . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the classical gs superstring action , which exists for @xmath3 @xcite , is an extension of the ng action to describe a string moving in an @xmath4 or @xmath5 superspace . </S>",
    "<S> quantization in the critical dimension ( @xmath1 ) leads to a supersymmetric spectrum of states , with massless ground states , and the same is true for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall review the main results to date of light - cone gauge quantization of 3d strings , focusing on closed strings but with some comments on open strings .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with a brief review of the hamiltonian formulation of the ng string . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical variables are maps from the string worldsheet , parametrized by @xmath6 to a minkowski phase space , with @xmath7-vector coordinates @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> it reappears quantum - mechanically in polyakov s covariant path - integral quantization @xcite but is not needed for a light - cone gauge quantization in the critical dimension @xcite and the same is true for @xmath2 , at least for free strings .    </S>",
    "<S> the lagrange multipliers @xmath17 appearing in the action ( [ hamactbos ] ) are analogous to the lapse and shift variables of the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity . as in that case </S>",
    "<S> , the constraint functions generate gauge invariances that are equivalent to reparametrization invariance , in this case of the string worldsheet . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to its gauge invariances , the action ( [ hamactbos ] ) is poincar invariant for periodic ( closed string ) or free - end ( open string ) boundary conditions . in 3d </S>",
    "<S> the poincar noether charges are @xmath18 the two casimirs of the 3d poincar group are @xmath19 and these may be used to classify the unitary irreducible representations @xcite , in particular @xmath20 is the mass . the quantity @xmath21 is sometimes called the `` spin '' but we prefer to reserve this term for the absolute value @xmath22 and call @xmath21 the `` relativistic helicity '' , which we usually abbreviate to `` helicity '' . </S>",
    "<S> so defined , spin is unchanged by parity , whereas the helicity changes sign . as both the ng string and </S>",
    "<S> its gs superstring extensions preserve parity , we should expect all massive states of non - zero spin to appear in parity doublets of opposite sign helicity , and it can be shown that this is indeed the case @xcite .    in our discussion of 3d gs superstrings we shall focus on the @xmath5 case for which the superspace coordinates are @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are a pair ( @xmath25 ) of two - component anti - commuting majorana spinors . </S>",
    "<S> the action is obtained in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> the first is to replace the differentials @xmath26 by the super - translation invariant 1-forms @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the 3d @xmath29 dirac matrices and summation over the index @xmath30 is implicit . </S>",
    "<S> the next step is the addition of a wz term constructed from a closed super - poincar invariant 3-form @xmath31 . for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> there is a 1-parameter family of such 3-forms , which we may parametrize in terms of a unit @xmath32-vector @xmath33 : @xmath34 the gs superstring is obtained by choosing @xmath35 , and a coefficient for the resulting wz term that leads to an additional fermionic gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> after gauge - fixing , this leads to a cancellation of zero - point energies and hence massless ground states .    in the quantum theory </S>",
    "<S> each oscillation mode of a string corresponds to some polarization state of a particle of definite mass - squared . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillator ground - state energy of the ng string is negative in the critical dimension , corresponding to a tachyon . </S>",
    "<S> it is undetermined in 3d and this complicates a discussion of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we focus here on the gs superstrings for which the ground states are those of a massless superparticle . </S>",
    "<S> for the critical dimension this leads to states corresponding to the polarization modes of a @xmath1 linearized supergravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath2 it again leads to an irreducible massless supermultiplet . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath5 it consists of two bosons and two fermions , which could be identified as the states of a massless vector supermultiplet ; this option would introduce a vector that could couple to objects carrying the central charge allowed by the @xmath5 supersymmetry algebra . </S>",
    "<S> we say `` option '' because spin is not defined for massless particles in 3d , despite the fact that there is still a distinction between bosons and fermions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all excited states of the 3d gs superstrings are massive , so let us now look at the structure of massive 3d supermultiplets . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the @xmath5 case , for which there are two hermitian spinor charges @xmath36 , @xmath25 ; the superfix @xmath37 indicates the spinor component . within a given representation </S>",
    "<S> , we may define the new non - hermitian supercharges @xmath38 \\ , , \\qquad { \\cal p}_-\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left({\\cal p}_1 - { \\cal p}_0\\right).\\ ] ] the coefficients are particular to the conventions used in @xcite , and in these conventions the anticommutation relations of the @xmath39 supercharges become equivalent to the anticommutation relations @xmath40 where we have allowed for a central charge @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the charges @xmath42 lower the helicity @xmath21 by @xmath43 , and that their hermitian conjugates @xmath44 raise it by @xmath43 . associated with any state annihilated by the @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> we then get a supermultiplet by successive actions of the operators @xmath44 on this state .    </S>",
    "<S> as we explain at the conclusion of this contribution , the possibility of a central charge is relevant to non - perturbative states in the spectrum , assuming that there is an interacting string theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , no state in the spectrum of a free @xmath5 superstring carries a central charge , so we now set @xmath45 . in this case , the construction summarised above leads to four - state supermultiplets with helicities @xmath46 for some average helicity @xmath47 , which is the superhelicity ( the value , divided by @xmath20 , of the casimir of the super - poincar group that generalizes @xmath48 ) . because parity flips the sign of superhelicity , the unique parity - preserving _ </S>",
    "<S> irreducible _ supermultiplet ( with @xmath45 ) has @xmath49 , and hence felicities @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this is just the scalar supermultiplet of 4d @xmath4 supersymmetry reduced to 3d .    </S>",
    "<S> one can show that all massive states of the string have at least a 4-fold degeneracy , in addition to the 4-fold degeneracy implied by supersymmetry , so the number of states at each mass level is a multiple of 16 . at the first level </S>",
    "<S> there are precisely 16 states which appear in 4 copies of the scalar supermultiplet just described . at the next level </S>",
    "<S> there are 8 copies of this supermultiplet plus 4 copies of the spin-2 supermultiplet with @xmath51 and 4 copies of the parity - conjugate spin-2 multiplet with @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> up to this point , there is nothing really unexpected . at the third level </S>",
    "<S> we get another 8 copies of the scalar supermultiplet with @xmath49 but the remaining 28 + 28 supermultiplets , which appear in parity doublets of opposite sign superhelicity , all have _ irrational _ </S>",
    "<S> superspin @xmath53 , and hence all states in these supermultiplets have irrational spin . </S>",
    "<S> although the details differ , irrational spins also appear in the spectrum for @xmath4 and for the 3d ng string .    </S>",
    "<S> irrational spins are possible because of a special feature of 3d : the universal cover of the lorentz group is not its double cover , the spin group @xmath54 ; if it were then @xmath21 would be quantized such that @xmath55 , as in 4d . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the universal cover is an _ </S>",
    "<S> infinite _ cover with representations for _ any _ value of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in any theory with irrational spins the `` lorentz '' group must be the universal cover of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this has significant implications for quantum statistics via the 3d spin - statistics theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) which relates the statistical phase @xmath57 to the helicity @xmath21 via the formula @xmath58 so a particle of spin @xmath21 such that @xmath59 is neither a boson nor a fermion but an _ </S>",
    "<S> anyon_. actually , it would be preferable to interpret `` anyon '' to mean @xmath60 because those cases for which @xmath61 for integer @xmath62 are also very special ; these are `` semions '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the presence of anyons in the spectrum of 3d strings may explain why @xmath2 does not appear to be exceptional when covariant quantization methods are used , e.g. the polyakov path - integral approach . </S>",
    "<S> these methods may tacitly assume that the `` lorentz '' group is @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting here that covariant quantization is already problematic for a 3d _ particle _ if it is an anyon , so it is not surprising that standard approaches to the covariant quantization of strings appear to exclude @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> one difficulty can be seen from the fact that manifestly lorentz covariant anyonic wave equations are necessarily infinite - dimensional @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a few comments on open 3d strings . in this case </S>",
    "<S> each endpoint may be free or fixed , or it may be fixed to lie on some curve . </S>",
    "<S> a unitary gauge quantization of the ng string with fixed ends was carried out by arvis @xcite , who concluded that rotational invariance is broken unless @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath2 is again exceptional because the relevant rotation group is then trivial , or abelian if the endpoints coincide . in the case of open gs superstrings , </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions must break some of the supersymmetry but there are cases in which half is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> let us focus on the @xmath5 superstring . for free endpoints , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 supersymmetry is broken to @xmath4 , as in the critical dimension . </S>",
    "<S> if the endpoints are fixed to lie on some curves , which may be interpreted as d - strings , then these curves must be parallel straight lines to preserve half the supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is expected in view of the ambiguity noted earlier in the superstring action ; we may associate the choice @xmath63 in ( [ wz ] ) with the d - string , by analogy to critical - dimension iib superstrings ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the remaining case in which half </S>",
    "<S> the supersymmetry is preserved occurs when both ends are fixed . </S>",
    "<S> if they are fixed at the same point then rotational invariance in the plane is preserved , and this becomes the so(2 ) symmetry of a standard supersymmetric quantum mechanics with two supersymmetry charges . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know if 3d strings can interact , but if they can it would be natural to interpret the endpoints as d0-branes , which would be described by a centrally - charged @xmath5 superparticle with a mass @xmath20 saturating the bogomolnyi bound @xmath64 that follows from the algebra ( [ sqm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantization of this superparticle action leads to a @xmath5 supermultiplet in which all states have spin @xmath65 @xcite ; in other words , the would - be d0-branes are semions </S>",
    "<S> . if the effective action for a pair of such d0-branes is , in the non - relativistic limit , a supersymmetric @xmath66 matrix mechanics with two supersymmetries , as is suggested by critical superstring theory , then the spin-@xmath65 nature of the d0-branes should also be apparent from their statistical phase . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this is precisely the conclusion of pedder , sonner and tong , who considered this model and computed the statistical phase as a berry phase @xcite .    </S>",
