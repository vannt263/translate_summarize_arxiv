    "the evolution of the spin state of co in lacoo@xmath0 with temperature has drawn a great deal of attention during last 50 years.@xcite the ground state of this compound is believed to be nonmagnetic ( spin s = 0 ) insulator .",
    "it shows two magnetic transitions at about 100 k ( a sharp transition ) and at around 500 k ( broad).@xcite the second transition is also accompanied by an insulator to metal transition .",
    "all these magnetic transitions have been attributed to the temperature induced spin state transition of co@xmath5 ions .",
    "initially it was believed that the transition at 100  k occurs due to the change in the spin state of co@xmath5 ion from low spin ( ls ) state ( @xmath6  =  0 ) to a mixed ls and high spin ( hs ) states ( @xmath7  =  2).@xcite in order to achieve a microscopic understanding of these transitions , photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) and @xmath8-ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) have been employed extensively , since these techniques help to probe the electronic structure directly.@xcite the experimental results were simulated using configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations for the cluster of coo@xmath9 octahedron .",
    "all these investigations inferred the presence of varying mixtures of ls and hs states above 100 k.    subsequently , a detailed study@xcite based on lda+@xmath1 ( lda = local density approximation and @xmath1 = electron - electron coulomb repulsion strength ) calculations , attributed the 100  k transitions to ls to orbital ordered intermediate spin ( is ) state ( @xmath10  =  1 ) and the one at 500  k to orbital disordered is state as the energy of the latter state was found to be higher than the former and lower than hs state .",
    "since then , numerous experimental and theoretical works have been carried out , which attributed the first transition to ls to is state.@xcite this has also been demonstrated by pes and xas studies,@xcite where co 2@xmath3 core level , valence band and o @xmath11-edge xas spectra of lacoo@xmath0 revealed 70% ls and 30% is states in the temperature range 100  k to 300  k. no contribution of hs state was observed up to 300  k.    recently , based on gga+@xmath1 ( gga = generalized gradient approximation ) calculations , kn@xmath12zek _ et al_. showed that the mixed ls - hs state ( 1:1 ) is the first excited state and thus attributed the first magnetic transition from ls to ls - hs state.@xcite this is in sharp contrast to the belief of is contributions in the intermediate temperature range . in addition , experimental results based on xas and magnetic circular dichroism@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering@xcite also interpreted in terms of mixed ls - hs state in the temperature range up to 700  k considering cluster approximations .",
    "it is , thus , evident that the spin state of co at different temperatures is still controversial .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the spin state of co in lacoo@xmath0 at room temperature using state - of - the - art photoemission spectroscopy and _ ab initio _ band structure calculations .",
    "we observe that spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) plays an important role in determining the electronic structure in this system .",
    "the comparison of the high resolution spectra and the calculated results suggest that the electronic structure of lacoo@xmath0 at room temperature has large is contributions .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations also provide a good representation of the experimental la 5@xmath3 and o 2@xmath4 core level spectra .",
    "single crystal of lacoo@xmath0 was grown and characterized as described elsewhere.@xcite the photoemission spectra of the valence band and shallow core levels were recorded at room temperature ( rt ) using a spectrometer equipped with monochromatic al @xmath13 ( 1486.6 ev ) and he i ( 21.2 ev ) sources , and a gammadata scienta analyzer , ses2002 .",
    "the base pressure during the measurements was about 4@xmath1410@xmath15 torr .",
    "the energy resolution for the @xmath8-ray photoemission was set to 0.3 ev for the valence band and 0.6 ev for the core level spectra .",
    "the resolution for the he i spectrum was fixed to 4 mev .",
    "the sample was cleaned _ in situ _ by scraping the sample surface using a diamond file .",
    "the cleanliness of the sample was ascertained by tracking the sharpness of o 1@xmath4 peak and absence of c 1@xmath4 peak .",
    "the fermi level was aligned by recording the valence band spectrum of an ag foil mounted on the same sample holder .    the lda+@xmath1 and gga+@xmath1 ( @xmath1 represents the electron correlation strength among co 3@xmath2 electrons ) , spin - polarized density of states ( dos ) calculations were carried out using lmtart 6.61 ( ref . 24 ) . for calculating charge density , full - potential linearized muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method working in plane wave representation",
    "was employed . in the calculation , we have used the muffin - tin radii of 3.515 , 2.005 , and 1.64 a.u . for la , co and o , respectively .",
    "the charge density and effective potential were expanded in spherical harmonics up to @xmath16 = 6 inside the sphere and in a fourier series in the interstitial region .",
    "the initial basis set included 6@xmath4 , 5@xmath3 , 5@xmath2 , and 4@xmath17 valence , and 5@xmath4 semicore orbitals of la ; 4@xmath4 , 4@xmath3 , and 3@xmath2 valence , and 3@xmath3 semicore orbitals of co , and 2@xmath4 and 2@xmath3 orbitals of o. the exchange correlation functional of the density functional theory was taken after h.s .",

    "self - consistency was achieved by demanding the convergence of the total energy to be smaller than 10@xmath21 ryd / cell .",

    "we have calculated various contributions in the dos of lacoo@xmath0 using both lda and lda+@xmath1 methods . in order to minimize uncertainty in the calculated results ,",
    "we have fixed the value of @xmath1 to the experimentally estimated values of 3.5  ev.@xcite    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we show the calculated lda results for both the up and down spin states .",
    "there are several features observed in different energy positions .",
    "the features between -1.5 ev to -3 ev energies are dominated by the o 2@xmath3 states with negligible contribution from other electronic states .",
    "these features are identified as o 2@xmath3 non - bonding states .",
    "the features at lower energies have dominant contributions from o 2@xmath3 electronic states with small but finite intensities from the co 3@xmath2 states having @xmath22 and @xmath23 symmetries .",
    "thus , the features between -3 to -4.5 ev can be attributed to bonding states with @xmath22 symmetry and those below -4.5 ev are the bonding states with @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "the antibonding features appear above -1.5 ev and have predominantly co 3@xmath2 character .",
    "co 3@xmath2 bands with @xmath22 symmetry appear between -1.5 to 0.5 ev and the @xmath23 bands between -1 to 3 ev .",
    "it is evident that the density of states at the fermi level is large suggesting a metallic phase in the ground state in contrast to the insulating phase observed in various experiments .",
    "the effect of electron correlation in the density of states is manifested in the lda+@xmath1 results as shown in fig .",
    "although electron correlation among o 2@xmath3 electrons is not considered in the calculations , the energy distribution of the o 2@xmath3 partial density of states ( pdos ) appears to be somewhat different from the lda results .",
    "the o 2@xmath3 contribution in the antibonding region appears to enhance in the lda+@xmath1 results compared to the lda results suggesting a spectral weight transfer from the bands having bonding character .",
    "the non - bonding o 2@xmath3 contributions also shift toward the fermi level .",
    "the changes in the co 3@xmath2 bands are most significant as expected .",
    "the bonding and antibonding @xmath23 bands shift towards higher energies .",
    "the bonding @xmath22 band appears almost at the same energies along with a significant increase in the spectral weight .",
    "subsequently , the antibonding @xmath22 band having primarily co 3@xmath2 character becomes narrower along with a reduction in spectral weight .",
    "it is , thus , clear that consideration of @xmath1 in the calculations leads to a decrease in co 3@xmath2 character and an increase in o 2@xmath3 character of the bands in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "although the overlap between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 band is minimized for these parameters , no hard gap is observed characterizing the systems to be metallic .",
    "and o 2@xmath3 partial density of states calculated using ( a ) lda+@xmath1 ( @xmath1 = 3.5 ev ) , ( b ) lda+@xmath1 ( @xmath1 = 4 ev ) and ( c ) gga+u ( @xmath1 = 3.5 ev ) methods.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in order to investigate the value of @xmath1 that creates a gap at the fermi level , we compare the co 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath3 pdos for @xmath1 = 3.5 ev and 4 ev in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , respectively .",
    "it is evident that , an increase in @xmath1 to 4 ev generates a band gap of about 0.2 ev . the shape and energy distribution of the dos is almost the same in both the cases .",
    "the gga is known to provide a better description of the exchange - correlation functional as it also considers first order correction to the spatial distribution of the electronic charge density used in the lda calculations . in gga ,",
    "total energy of the system improves@xcite and it is expected that the energy position of different bands would also improve .",
    "the calculated pdos of co 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath3 corresponding to gga+@xmath1 calculations are shown in fig .",
    "in contrast to the metallic phase observed in lda results , a value of @xmath1 = 3.5 ev creates a band gap of about 0.22 ev at the fermi level in the results corresponding to gga calculations , which is very close to that observed experimentally.@xcite however , the shape and positions of co 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath3 bands is very similar in the lda+@xmath1 and gga+@xmath1 results .",
    "thus , we used gga+@xmath1 method in the rest part of our study to discuss the experimental results .     and o 2@xmath3 partial density of states corresponding to low spin ( ls ) , intermediate spin ( is ) and high spin ( hs ) configurations using gga+@xmath1 method.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we now turn to the question of the influence of various spin states in the electronic structure of lacoo@xmath0 .",
    "the pdos obtained for different spin state configurations are shown in fig .  3 for the same values of @xmath1 (= 3.5 ev ) .",
    "it is evident that although the ls configuration leads to insulating ground state , the electronic structure corresponding to is and hs configuration converges to metallic phase .",
    "this is a well know fact for this system and one needs to consider additional parameters such as orbital ordering to achieve insulating phase.@xcite however , the energy distribution of the dos over the large binding energy scale remains very similar .",
    "there are three distinctly separable features a , b and c in the dos in fig .",
    "3 . in the case of is configuration , the @xmath22 band becomes partially filled .",
    "this effect enhances further in the case of hs configuration .",
    "the total intensity of the feature a gradually decreases with the change in spin state configuration from ls @xmath24 is @xmath24 hs . in addition , the co 3@xmath2 character of the feature a becomes highest in the is configuration ( 80.3% ) while it is about 63.8% in the ls state and 64.8% in the hs state .",
    "the feature b representing the non - bonding o 2@xmath3 states appears at slightly higher binding energies in the is and hs states compared to that in the ls state .",
    "the change in the feature c is again substantial .",
    "the o 2@xmath3 and co 3@xmath2 contributions are almost similar in ls and is cases . in the case of hs states ,",
    "the feature c has dominant o 2@xmath3 character and a new feature d having dominant co 3@xmath2 character appears beyond 6 ev binding energies .     and o 2@xmath3 partial density of states corresponding to low spin ( ls ) , intermediate spin ( is ) and high spin ( hs ) configurations calculated including spin - orbit interactions .",
    "all these calculations are performed using gga+@xmath1 method.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    all the above calculations are done without considering the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in any of the electronic states .",
    "recently , there is a growing realization that soc plays crucial role in determining the electronic structure in various transition metal oxides .",
    "the importance of soc has been demonstrated in the systems possessing rare - earth 4@xmath17 electrons.@xcite in ca@xmath25ruo@xmath26 , it was shown that soc plays an important role in the changeover of the spin and orbital anisotropy as a function of temperature.@xcite very recent theoretical studies of ca@xmath0corho@xmath9 compound have shown that the insulating ground state can be achieved by considering soc in the calculations.@xcite in order to investigate the effect in the present case , we have calculated the pdos in all the cases including soc .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that soc has no significant influence in the case of ls configuration .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that all the energy bands are completely filled .",
    "the effect is most pronounced in fig .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to compare the calculated results with the experimental spectra , we show the background subtracted experimental valence band spectra at rt in fig .",
    "the spectra show three distinct features at about 1.0 , 2.9 and 5.3 ev binding energies denoted by a , b and c , respectively . the relative intensity of various features are significantly different in the spectra using al @xmath13 and he i sources .",
    "while the feature a is most intense in the al @xmath13 spectrum , it becomes weakest in intensity in the he i spectrum .",
    "subsequently , the intensities of the features b and c become dominant in the he i spectrum .",
    "it is well known that the photoemission cross section is very sensitive to the excitation energies.@xcite while the cross section of o 2@xmath3 states is larger than that of co 3@xmath2 states in the he i spectrum , the relative cross section becomes opposite in the al @xmath13 energies making the cross section for co 3@xmath2 states significantly larger than that of o 2@xmath3 states .",
    "thus , the changes in intensity of various features due to the change in excitation energy suggests that the feature a is predominantly contributed by co 3@xmath2 states and the features b and c have large o 2@xmath3 character .",
    "no significant feature is observed between 6 to 8 ev binding energies .",
    "this clearly suggests that the experimental results are very similar to the results obtained for is configuration shown in fig .",

    "the peak position of the feature b is somewhat higher ( 0.5 ev ) in the experimental spectra compared to the calculated results .",
    "such small shift in the completely filled non - bonding o 2@xmath3 bands has often been observed in the lda results due to the underestimation of the electron correlation among the o 2@xmath3 electrons.@xcite the energy positions of the features a and c in the experimental spectra , and the large co 3@xmath2 character of the feature a and o 2@xmath3 character of feature c is revealed remarkably in the calculated results .",
    "even the small shoulder in the binding energy range 5.5 - 7.5 ev with relatively larger o 2@xmath3 character is reproduced in the calculated results .",
    "these results clearly suggest that the electronic structure of lacoo@xmath0 at room temperature corresponds primarily to the intermediate spin state configuration of co and the contribution from hs state configuration may not be so significant .",
    "these results appear to be different from those in the recent studies based on cluster approximations.@xcite such difference may not be surprising as in the cluster calculations , the co 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath3 bands are approximated to atomic energy levels .     and o 2@xmath4 core level spectra ( symbols ) collected at room temperature .",

    ". such study will be quite interesting as core - hole potential is known to influence the final states of the core level photoemission .",

    "three distinct features visible in the spectrum .",
    "the features at 16 and 18 ev binding energies correspond to spin - orbit split la 5@xmath3 states as marked in the figure .",
    "the feature around 21 ev binding energy represent the signature of photoemission from o 2@xmath4 levels .",
    "we also show the la 5@xmath3 and o 2@xmath4 pdos corresponding to ls , is and hs configurations in different panels of fig .",
    "all the three features are present in the calculated results corresponding to ls , is and hs states .",
    "the shape of the bands in each region remains almost the same in each spin state .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of the la 5@xmath3 contributions in the pdos is about 2 ev as also observed in the experimental spectra .",
    "however , the peak position of the bands corresponding to ls state appears at binding energies lower by about 1 ev in comparison to energies corresponding to is and hs states , which are closer to the experimental spectra .    in order to simulate the experimental spectrum ,",
    "we have shifted the calculated o 2@xmath4 and la 5@xmath3 pdos obtained from is configuration by 3.1 ev and 1.2 ev , respectively and then multiplied by photoemission cross sections of the corresponding states.@xcite to account for the lifetime broadening and resolution broadening , o 2@xmath4 and la 5@xmath3 pdos are convoluted with a suitable lorentzian and a gaussian , respectively .",
    "the simulated spectrum is shown by solid line overlapped on the experimental spectrum in fig .",
    "the reproduction of the experimental spectrum is remarkable .",
    "this suggests that one can indeed employ band structure calculations to determine the core level spectrum .",
    "it is to note here that these calculations can not create features appearing due to different screening effects expected in the final state of photoemission .",
    "almost perfect reproduction of the experimental spectrum in the present case indicates that final state effects may not be significant in the case of la 5@xmath3 photoemission .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic structure of lacoo@xmath0 at room temperature using various forms of _ ab initio _ calculations and high resolution photoemission spectroscopy on high quality single crystal .",
    "we observe that gga+@xmath1 calculations provide a good description of the ground state .",
    "spin - orbit coupling appears to play a significant role in the case of is and hs states of co , which is most pronounced in the case of is state of co. the calculated co 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath3 partial density of states corresponding to intermediate spin state of co provide the best description of the experimental valence band spectra at room temperature .",
    "this suggests that the spin state of co at room temperature presumably has dominant intermediate spin configuration and that the contribution from high spin state is not so significant at this temperature .",
    "the applicability of the _ ab initio _ band structure calculations in understanding the shallow core level spectrum is also studied .",
