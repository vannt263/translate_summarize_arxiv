    "in this era of nanotechnology , it is becoming increasingly feasible to construct molecular wires and circuits , with specific constituents , and in desired configurations @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important and interesting to study electron transport through fundamental structures .",
    "one of the most common organic molecules is benzene , which is important due to its structural simplicity and its appearance in larger compounds .",
    "consequently , in this article , we will be extending previous work , studying electron transmission through an atomic wire containing a single benzene molecule .",
    "sulston and davison @xcite used the renormalization technique @xcite to rework the benzene molecule as a dimer with rescaled parameters , connected to leads in each of the three possible configurations , namely para , meta and ortho .",
    "( more generally , they also used the method to consider 2 or 3 benzenes connected in series or parallel , although here we discuss circuits of only a single benzene molecule . )",
    "they then used the lippmann - schwinger equation to calculate the transmission - energy probability function @xmath0 for each case .",
    "the 3 circuit types yielded very distinctive graphs , with the transmittivities largely determined by the number and positions of resonances and anti - resonances , with a general conclusion being that para - benzene is the strongest transmitter , and meta - benzene the weakest .    in this paper , we extend the work of sulston and davison , by considering a modified benzene molecule , wherein one of the carbon atoms is replaced by another atom ( or , alternatively , a carbon atom is displaced from its normal position ) .",
    "the methodology is that of @xcite , where the modification to the molecule is modelled by changing the site energy for the perturbed atomic site , and its bond energies with the two adjacent carbon sites .",
    "the perturbed atom can have different locations relative to the sites attached to the leads , so that there are a fairly large number of possible configurations , resulting in a diversity of behaviours for the @xmath0 curves .",
    "the methodology utilized the lippmann - schwinger theory @xcite applied to electron transport through an atomic wire containing an asymmetric dimer impurity , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the wire itself consists of an infinite chain of atoms , with site energy @xmath1 on each atom , and bond energy @xmath2 between neighbouring atoms .",
    "embedded within it is an asymmetric dimer impurity occupying two adjacent sites , with the properties that the site energies are changed to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the bond energy between these sites is modified to @xmath5 .",
    "the electron - transmission properties of this structure have been well - studied @xcite , and the transmission - energy probability function @xmath0 has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 and the reduced dimensionless energy is @xmath9 this model provides a very efficient framework for studying transmission through a wide variety of systems @xcite , provided that the system can be reduced to a dimer via the renormalization method ( as discussed in the next section ) , with rescaled parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the transmission function is then calculated by way of ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the model under consideration here is shown in figure [ fig2 ] , consisting of a modified benzene ring attached to atomic wire leads .",
    "the ring consists of 6 atoms , with site energies @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) , with adjacent atoms @xmath15 and @xmath16 connected by a bond of energy @xmath17 . in ordinary benzene , the atoms are all identical , so that @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for the systems being considered here ,",
    "the benzene is modified so that one of the atoms ( say , @xmath20 ) is distinct from the others , which is modelled by taking @xmath21 and @xmath22 . referring again to figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the three possible connection schemes for the leads are : ( i ) para , in which the leads are attached at opposite ends of the benzene , i.e. positions 1 and 4 , ( ii ) meta , where they are attached at positions 1 and 5 , and ( iii ) ortho , using adjacent positions , namely 1 and 6 . with this in mind",
    ", there would seem to be 18 possible combinations to consider , specifically , modification of each of atoms 1 through 6 for each of the 3 types of leads .",
    "however , due to symmetry considerations , there are actually fewer unique cases . for example , in the para case , modifying atom 1 is equivalent to modifiying atom 4 , while modifications to atoms 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 are equivalent .",
    "thus , in the para case , we only need to consider modifications to atoms 1 and 2 , which we denote as para-1 and para-2 , respectively . by similar reasoning ,",
    "the remaining unique combinations are meta-1 , meta-2 , meta-3 , meta-6 , ortho-1 , ortho-2 and ortho-3 , making a total of 9 cases to consider .",
    "each of the 9 modified benzene molecules can be reduced to a dimer , by means of the renormalization method @xcite , which eliminates , one - by - one , the 4 atoms of the ring not attached to leads , leaving the remaining two atoms , with rescaled parameters , attached to the rest of the wire .",
    "the derivation of the method is given in @xcite , for example , but the key result is that elimination of atom @xmath15 leaves its nearest - neighbour atoms @xmath23 , with rescaled parameters given by @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 the renormalization process is shown schematically in figure [ fig3 ] , using para-1 benzene as an example .",
    "the renormalization equations ( [ eq5])-([eq7 ] ) are applied at each step , and the final rescaled parameters for the dimer can then be calculated recursively . for the sake of brevity , we give below only the final rescaled parameters for each of the 9 cases , noting again that for each case , the dimer consists of the rescaled sites originally attached to the leads . for convenience ,",
    "the results are expressed using reduced energies @xmath27 from ( [ eq4 ] ) and @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55",
    "it is now possible to evaluate @xmath0 in ( [ eq1 ] ) , for each of the 9 systems . for each case",
    ", one uses the corresponding trio of rescaled parameters , given above , as the choice of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , in ( [ eq3 ] ) . for parameter values , we chose @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which leads to non - zero transmission probabilities for the energy range @xmath58 .",
    "we vary @xmath59 and @xmath60 , to see the variety of behaviour that can arise in each case .",
    "looking first at para-1 benzene , curves for the case where @xmath61 are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .     versus energy @xmath62 for para-1 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) ,",
    "( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    figure [ fig4](a ) reproduces the previously published situation @xcite where @xmath68 , corresponding to an unmodified ( or `` pure '' ) para - benzene . in this case , the @xmath0 curve is symmetric about the band centre , with resonances at @xmath69 , but no anti - resonances . upon setting @xmath70 ( figure [ fig4](b , c ) ) ,",
    "the resonance peaks are shifted to lower energies , in accord with the lowering of @xmath59 , with the lower peak decreasing in height to non - resonance status . the absence of anti - resonances persists .",
    "continuing with para-1 , the curves for @xmath71 are shown in figure [ fig5 ] .     versus energy @xmath62 for para-1 benzene , with @xmath72 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    the curves are similar to their counterparts in figure [ fig4 ] , but with further rearrangement of the locations and heights of the peaks , and specifically a tendency towards lower energies .",
    "this trend continues with further modification of @xmath60 to a value of @xmath73 ( figure [ fig6 ] ) , and in particular , in graphs ( a ) and ( b ) , the lower peak has been down - shifted far enough so as to assimilate it into the lower band edge .     versus energy @xmath62 for para-1 benzene , with @xmath74 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    interestingly , in ( a ) , resonance is restored in the upper peak . in both figures",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , there are again no anti - resonances .",
    "it might be considered that the value @xmath74 is somewhat extreme , and that the value of @xmath67 in figure [ fig5 ] is more realistic , in which case we conclude that the effect of modifying @xmath60 is fairly modest , in comparison to that of @xmath59 . also , it is important to note , here , and in fact in all the results , that the @xmath0 curve is always symmetric whenever @xmath68 ( the green solid curve ( a ) in each figure ) .",
    "turning next to para-2 benzene , the curves for @xmath61 are given in figure [ fig7 ] .     versus energy @xmath62 for para-2 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    first ,",
    "note that the curve in figure [ fig7](a ) is again that for pure benzene , which was given above as figure [ fig4](a ) .",
    "now , when @xmath70 ( figure [ fig7](b , c ) ) , the most striking feature is the creation of a pair of anti - resonances .",
    "their energies are , approximately , symmetrically placed for smaller @xmath59 ( figure [ fig7](b ) ) , but move to lower energies as @xmath59 shifts to lower energies ( figure [ fig7](c ) ) .",
    "the positions of the resonance peaks of ( a ) are relatively unaffected , although their heights are somewhat diminished .",
    "when @xmath60 is varied to @xmath67 ( figure [ fig8 ] ) , the new anti - resonances persist , and in particular , in the curve ( a ) where @xmath75 , indicating that any perturbation to the pure benzene on site 2 ( or an equivalent site ) is enough to create anti - resonances .     versus energy @xmath62 for para-2 benzene , with @xmath72 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]",
    "this is an interesting contrast to the para-1 situation , where it remains free of anti - resonances , regardless of the values of the perturbation parameters .",
    "otherwise , the curves of figure [ fig8 ] look very similar to those of figure [ fig7](b , c ) , once again showing the relatively moderate effect of modifying @xmath60 .",
    "next , we consider meta-1 benzene , for which the curves with @xmath61 are given in figure [ fig9 ] .     versus energy @xmath62 for meta-1 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    the graph in figure [ fig9](a ) , where @xmath68 also , is that for pure meta - benzene , from @xcite .",
    "in this case , there are 3 anti - resonances , at @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which along with the band edges , define four bands of transmission .",
    "the two outer bands contain resonances corresponding to strong transmission , while the inner bands have much smaller peaks and thus weaker transmission .",
    "on taking @xmath70 in figure [ fig9](b , c ) , it is observed that the anti - resonances are , in fact , pinned , at the above energies , resulting in comparative stability in the @xmath0 curves .",
    "nonetheless , the curves do exhibit some interesting features , such as the fact that the resonances of ( a ) are lowered in height as @xmath59 decreases from @xmath78 , and the lower resonance shows a splitting into 2 sub - peaks .",
    "similar observations are made when @xmath60 is varied ( graphs not shown ) , namely the anti - resonances are still fixed in energy , the resonances are reduced in height , and the inner non - resonant peaks show some small increase in height .    moving on , we look at meta-2 benzene , for which the curves with @xmath61 are displayed in figure [ fig10 ] .     versus energy @xmath62 for meta-2 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    the graph for pure benzene is presented again in figure [ fig10](a ) , with its 3 anti - resonances , at @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "as @xmath59 is varied , it is seen that the anti - resonances at @xmath79 remain fixed , while that at @xmath76 shifts in energy , and indeed it is the case that its energy is @xmath80 .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation for meta-1 , where all three anti - resonances remain fixed .",
    "meanwhile , the two resonance peaks decrease in height , the lower one more substantially than the upper one , while the two small inner peaks show some change in height , the upper one increasing quite noticeably , and the lower one decreasing almost to the point of disappearance , as the anti - resonance at @xmath80 shifts towards coalescence with the one at @xmath81 .",
    "these features of meta-2 are reinforced when @xmath60 is varied from its standard value ( figure [ fig11 ] ) .     versus energy @xmath62 for meta-2 benzene , with @xmath72 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    in particular , the positions of the anti - resonances are unchanged from their values in figure [ fig10 ] , while there is further rearrangement in the peaks , especially the upper of the 2 inner peaks .",
    "now , we turn to meta-3 benzene ( figure [ fig12 ] ) , with again the pure benzene case given as a reference point ( figure [ fig12](a ) ) .     versus energy @xmath62 for meta-3 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    varying @xmath59 , while keeping @xmath61 , shows that now it is the anti - resonance at @xmath76 that is pinned , while the pair at @xmath79 shift to lower energies ( as @xmath59 does so ) .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the situations seen above for meta-1 and meta-2 .",
    "simultaneously , there is rearrangement in the peaks , most noticeably a diminishment of the lowest ( originally - resonant ) peak and a partial splitting of the uppermost one .",
    "furthermore ( graphs not shown ) , the two anti - resonances at @xmath79 do in fact shift with variation of @xmath60 ( in contrast to meta-1 and meta-2 ) , moving closer to each other and to the pinned anti - resonance at @xmath76 . the consequent effect , then , is to further diminish the inner pair of peaks while amplifying the outer pair .",
    "lastly in the meta - family , we come to meta-6 benzene , with pure benzene shown again , for reference , in figure [ fig13](a ) .     versus energy @xmath62 for meta-6 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    as @xmath59 is varied ,",
    "something interesting and unique to this system occurs ( figure [ fig13](b , c ) ) .",
    "the lowest anti - resonance , at @xmath81 , merely shifts , rather mundanely , to somewhat lower energies .",
    "however , the other two anti - resonances , at @xmath76 and @xmath82 shift closer to one another ( figure [ fig13](b ) ) , and eventually ( for @xmath83 ) coalesce and then disappear ( figure [ fig13](c ) ) , leaving the lowest anti - resonance as the sole survivor .",
    "this remarkable occurrence has substantial impact on the @xmath0 curve , specifically by now allowing significant transmission in the mid - band energy regime .",
    "when @xmath60 is varied ( graphs not shown ) , this effect can even be strengthened , although the structure of the @xmath0 curve is dominated by the number and positions of the anti - resonances .",
    "we now turn our attention to the ortho - benzene group , beginning with ortho-1 .",
    "the starting point is , once again , the pure benzene case , which is shown in figure [ fig14](a ) @xcite .     versus energy @xmath62 for ortho-1 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) ,",
    "( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    it can be seen that there are 4 anti - resonances , at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , thus dividing the band into 5 regions of transmission ( none resonant ) , with the middle one clearly being dominant . on varying @xmath59 , while keeping @xmath60 constant ( figure [ fig14](b , c ) ) , it is observed that all 4 anti - resonances remain pinned , and there is some moderate rearrangement within the regions of transmission , with some increasing in height and others decreasing . upon allowing @xmath60 to vary as well ( graphs not shown ) ,",
    "the anti - resonances remain in their original positions , with the result that all graphs look very much the same .",
    "these features are qualitatively similar to those seen in the para-1 and meta-1 situations , namely graphs dominated by anti - resonances that are fixed in number and position .    next",
    ", we look at ortho-2 benzene ( figure [ fig15 ] ) , with figure [ fig15](a ) showing the pure case .     versus energy @xmath62 for ortho-2 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    variation of @xmath59 , as seen in figure [ fig15](b , c ) , indicates that the outer pair of anti - resonances , at @xmath85 , are fixed in energy , while the inner pair , at @xmath84 are not .",
    "this situation allows for considerable rearrangement of the @xmath0 curve and its sub - regions , as is clear from the graphs . indeed , in figure [ fig15](c )",
    ", it can be seen that the anti - resonance , originally at @xmath81 , is shifted downwards in energy , far enough so that it coalesces with the one at @xmath86 .",
    "variation of @xmath60 ( graphs not shown ) still leaves the outer anti - resonances pinned at @xmath85 , while allowing the inner pair to move even further , so that transmission profiles significantly different from the pure case can be achieved .",
    "lastly , we arrive at ortho-3 benzene , with ( as usual ) the pure case shown in figure [ fig16](a ) .     versus energy @xmath62 for ortho-3 benzene , with @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( a ) @xmath65 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) @xmath66 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) @xmath67 ( blue short - dashed).,width=453 ]    on varying @xmath59 ( with @xmath61 )",
    ", we can see that , in contrast to ortho-1 and ortho-2 , it is now the inner pair of anti - resonances ( at @xmath84 ) that are pinned , while the outer pair ( initially at @xmath85 ) move to lower energies as @xmath59 does . as a result , the dominant central peak is relatively unaffected by changes in @xmath59 , while the outer regions show huge variations , even to the extent that two of these regions all but disappear in figure [ fig16](c ) .",
    "this behaviour persists when @xmath60 is allowed to vary ( graphs not shown ) , because , although the anti - resonances at @xmath84 still remain fixed , again the movement of the other pair allows considerable rearrangement of the transmission curve , and indeed significant enhancement of transmission near the band edges .",
    "in this paper , we have used the renormalization method to study the electron transmission properties of a benzene molecule , in which one of its carbon atoms has been perturbed or replaced .",
    "the different combinations of lead attachments and location of the modified atom produce a total of 9 variations on the basic system .",
    "consequently , a rich variety of behaviours are observed in the @xmath0 curves , as the perturbation parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are varied . as would be expected , the basic shape of the @xmath0 curve is primarily determined by the number and locations of anti - resonances and maxima ( resonant or not ) .",
    "of the two parameters , the site energy @xmath59 is seen to be the more important , with the effect of moderate changes in @xmath60 usually being fairly modest .",
    "a general observation is that the @xmath0 curve is symmetric whenever @xmath87 , regardless of whether @xmath60 equals @xmath2 or not .",
    "the clearest cases are those for which @xmath88 , namely when the modified atom is attached directly to one of the leads . in these situations ( para-1 , meta-1 , ortho-1 ) , the number of anti - resonances is unchanged by variation of the parameters , and those that do exist are pinned in energy . as a result ,",
    "changes in the @xmath0 curve with @xmath59 and/or @xmath60 are rather limited , so these systems are fairly close to the corresponding ones involving pure benzene . more diverse , and thus more interesting , behaviour arises when @xmath89 , wherein some or all of the anti - resonances shift in energy as the parameters are varied , and moreover , there are cases where new anti - resonances are created ( para-2 ) or existing ones disappear ( meta-6 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the anti - resonances that are pinned remain so for all parameter values , while those that are not pinned can shift in energy with either @xmath59 or @xmath60 or both .",
    "thus , the @xmath89 systems show more promise from the perspective of circuit design , in that they allow for much greater flexibility in fine - tuning the desired transmission properties , and in some cases ( such as meta-2 ) , significantly enhance the transmittivity .",
