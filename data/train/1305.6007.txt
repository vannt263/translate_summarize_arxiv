    "recently there have been several studies in the field of ultra cold quantum gases with large magnetic dipoles@xcite @xcite ; for example dy atoms were cooled and trapped @xcite , and bose - einstein condensation has been observed in a @xmath0cr system @xcite@xcite . also studies on molecules with electric dipole such as @xmath1k@xmath2cr have been made ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction between dipoles is especially interesting for two reasons : it has long range and it is anisotropic . in ultra cold quantum gases in fact",
    "there are usually only s - wave contact interactions , which are short ranged and isotropic , and adding dipolar interaction bring novel features to such systems .",
    "the anisotropy of dipolar interactions has two main consequences : the appearance of instability in 3d systems and the formation of several peculiar structures .",
    "large dipolar systems are unstable in three dimensions , due to the head to tail attraction @xcite ; in order to avoid this problem pseudo-2d systems , obtained with anisotropic optical traps , are studied : in a reduced dimensionality the system becomes stable , provided the interaction is sufficiently repulsive @xcite . the anisotropy has also been shown to be the cause of remarkable structures in ultra cold gases .",
    "an example is the biconcave condensate described in @xcite , or the stripes that appear when the dipoles are tilted @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study a two dimensional system of bose atoms with dipole moment in a harmonic trap .",
    "the dipole moments are all parallel , and their direction is assumed to be fixed by an external magnetic or electric field .",
    "our aim in particular is to study the influence of inclination of the dipoles with respect to the @xmath3 plane on the physical properties of the system .",
    "we note in fact that while 2d or pseudo-2d systems have also been studied before ( see for example @xcite ) most of this studies were made either for bulk systems or for trapped systems with vertical dipoles .",
    "this physical system was previously studied via exact diagonalization in @xcite ; of course exact diagonalization only allows the study of very small systems : only a 3 particles systems could be studied .",
    "we instead use a quantum monte carlo technique , that allows us to consider larger systems ; in particular we will study a system made by 3 , 19 and 100 atoms .",
    "we focus on the structural properties of the dipolar system , studying the single particle density and the radial pair correlation function , to see how the tilt angle affects them .",
    "we compare the structures emerging in the quantum system with the ones of the classical analogue , estimated with classical monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also evaluate the superfluid fraction and the total energy of our sample .",
    "this document is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the physical system in analysis . in section iii",
    "we describe the simulation technique we used . in section",
    "iv we show the results of our simulations and finally we present our conclusions in section v.",
    "we consider a system of @xmath4 atoms in the @xmath3 plane in a optical trap ; these atoms interact because of thei dipole moment .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system is @xmath5 @xmath6 here represents an optical trap like the ones used in experiments on ultra cold quantum gases .",
    "such a trap in general can be modelled using a harmonic potential of the form @xmath7 the interaction between the atoms in the trap is due to their dipole moments .",
    "the dipole moments are vectors in the @xmath8 plane ; they are all parallel , and their direction is given by a strong external magnetic or electric field . following the notation in @xcite",
    "we define the tilt angle @xmath9 as the angle between the moments and the @xmath10 axis ; for reference @xmath11 means that the dipoles are aligned to the @xmath12 axis , while tilting the dipoles means decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "the interaction between two parallel dipoles can be written as @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the dipole strength and @xmath15 is the angle between the dipole moment and the vector @xmath16 .",
    "if our atoms have an electric dipole @xmath17 we have @xmath18 , while if they have a magnetic dipole @xmath17 we have @xmath19 .",
    "it has been shown that a system composed by dipoles is unstable in three dimensions @xcite , so experiments are usually made in a pseudo 2d environment , obtained using a strongly anisotropic trap .",
    "this means that in the equation ( [ trap ] ) we have @xmath20 ; defining the oscillator length @xmath21 this means that @xmath22 . in the computations we can make a choice",
    ": we can consider a pseudo 2d system , using an effective potential , obtained integrating the actual potential along the @xmath12 direction as in @xcite or we can consider a strictly 2d system , i.e. taking the limit @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we saw after performing some preliminary computations that if we set a @xmath25 small enough the results for the two systems are essentially the same ; in order to speed up the computations we decided to focus on the strictly 2d system , for which we can use the potential [ pot ] . in 2d the potential [ pot ]",
    "is repulsive and isotropic as long as @xmath26 ; tilting the dipoles has the effect of causing anisotropy , and along with anisotropy head to tail attraction appears . due to this attraction , decreasing @xmath9 too much will cause the system to collapse . the 2d system however has been shown to be stable for @xmath27 @xcite . in order to avoid to deal with the instability we performed our computations in the region @xmath28 .",
    "quantum monte carlo techniques are widely used in the study of condensed matter systems , and in particular they have several applications in the field of ultra cold quantum gases @xcite .",
    "an especially useful technique for such systems is the worm algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm , which is a variant of the path integral monte carlo scheme , allows the exact evaluation of thermal averages of physical observables for a system of bose particles in the grand canonical ensemble at finite temperature",
    ".    in path integral monte carlo simulations @xcite the quantum classical isomorphism is used , so that it is possible to study a quantum system by simulating a classical system of special polymers .",
    "the worm algorithm allows to easily take into account the interparticle permutations that have to be introduced when studying a system of indistinguishable quantum particles .",
    "further details on these techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "we note that path integral monte carlo suffers from the sign problem when dealing with fermions : for this reason we focus only on bosons .    in all our simulations we set @xmath29 , so that we have @xmath30 .",
    "having made this choice we measure all the lengths in units @xmath31 and all the energies and temperatures in units @xmath32 .",
    "we set the imaginary time increment @xmath33 . for the propagator we used the primitive approximation .",
    "all our simulations were made at the temperature @xmath34 .",
    "we made this choice because we were interested in studying the ground state behaviour of our system ; previous works @xcite shown that the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state should be at least @xmath35 in our energy units , so using @xmath34 should allow us to avoid meaningful contributions of the excited states to our thermal averages .",
    "using a finite temperature technique to study ground state properties may seem odd , but it should be noted that our technique unlike zero temperature qmc schemes does not use trial wave functions that may introduce a bias in the computations . in accord",
    "to @xcite we set @xmath36 in all the simulations .",
    "we considered systems of increasing size , starting from @xmath37 particles and then going to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "using the worm algorithm we are working in the grand canonical ensemble , and so the particle number fluctuates ; its average value is set by the chemical potential @xmath40 of the simulation . in our simulations",
    "the fluctuations of this quantity are practically negligible , so in practice we can think we are working with a fixed particle number .",
    "the physical quantities we evaluate are the single particle density @xmath41 , the radial correlation function @xmath42 , the energy per particle @xmath43 and the superfluid fraction @xmath44 .",
    "we perform several computations , varying the tilt angle @xmath9 from @xmath45 ( near to the stability threshold ) to @xmath46 ( vertical dipoles ) .    the density profile @xmath41 is obtained simply by evaluating the histogram of the position of the particles during the simulation .",
    "similarly the radial correlation function @xmath42 is estimated by taking the histogram of the distances of the particle pairs . since we are considering a finite system we are not using periodic boundary conditions , and so we ca nt use the winding number estimator to compute the superfluid fraction ; instead , we use the area estimator @xcite .    along with the quantum monte carlo simulations we also performed a classical study of the trapped dipoles system .",
    "this classical study consisted firstly in determining the classical ground state of our system . in order to do that we used the simulated annealing technique @xcite .",
    "then we made classical monte carlo simulations at finite temperature ; we made these computations to compare @xmath41 in the quantum and classical cases , so that we can compare the effect of thermal and quantum fluctuations on the properties of the trapped dipoles system .",
    "firstly let us consider the structural properties of our system , i.e. the density and the radial correlation function .",
    "we start with a system of three dipoles . for vertical dipoles , @xmath26 ,",
    "the interaction is isotropic and repulsive . in the ground state",
    "the dipoles form an equilateral triangle around the centre of the trap .",
    "we can see that by observing a snapshot of a simulation in figure ( [ triang ] ) .",
    "example of configuration of a three particle simulation with @xmath26 , @xmath36 , @xmath34 .",
    "each point is the position of a particle in a given timeslice .",
    "a triangular structure can be seen .",
    "the lengths are in units of @xmath31 . ]",
    "this triangle during the simulation is free to rotate around the centre of the trap , so that on average the density displays a hole in the centre and a maximum at a fixed radius .",
    "if we instead consider tilted dipoles this behaviour changes .",
    "a system with small @xmath9 , @xmath47 , displays a linear structure : the atoms form a line which is parallel to the @xmath10 axis . by increasing the tilt angle",
    "@xmath9 the linear structure is progressively lost , and the isotropic behaviour is fully restored for @xmath48 .",
    "we show in figure ( [ ro_3 ] ) the density profiles for increasing tilt angles from @xmath49 to @xmath26 .",

    "<S> we present a quantum monte carlo study of the ground state properties of a two dimensional system of bose particle with dipole moment in a harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the dipoles is assumed to be fixed by an external field . </S>",
    "<S> we study how the system behaves when the direction of the dipole moments is changed . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is made using path integral monte carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble , using the worm algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we study systems of increasing size , focusing on the spatial distribution of the atoms inside the trap and on the superfluid fraction of the sample . we find that vertical dipoles form a crystal , characterized by a shell structure , while tilting the dipoles has the effect of inducing a striped structure . </S>",
    "<S> we find that similar behaviour can be found in the analogue classical system . </S>",
    "<S> vertical dipoles display nonclassical inertia while a strong tilting decreases superfluidity . </S>"
