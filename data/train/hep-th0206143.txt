    "the casimir effect @xcite is a very fundamental feature common to all quantum field theories , which arises in particular , as is well known , when there is a departure from the topology of the ordinary flat spacetime towards non - trivial topologies .",
    "it has been studied intensively in the last years due to its importance in elementary particle physics , cosmology and condensed matter physics see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on the theoretical and experimental aspects of this effect , and also refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "whenever we deal with a confined charged quantum field , it is a natural question to ask for the influence of external fields on their zero - point oscillations and to investigate its consequences on the casimir effect .",
    "the influence of external fields on zero - point oscillations of unconfined charged bosonic and fermionic fields and the construction of the corresponding effective field theories ( at the one - loop level ) is an honorable subject and it is linked to the pioneering works of the thirties by heisenberg , kockel and euler , heisenberg and euler , and weisskopf @xcite and of the fifties by schwinger @xcite .",
    "more recently , the influence of a uniform magnetic field was extensively treated by dittrich and reuter in the monograph @xcite , and zeta function techniques were employed to construct effective lagrangians for scalars and dirac fields for @xmath4 and higher dimensions in constant background fields ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "ambjorn and wolfram considered the influence of an electrical field on the vacuum fluctuations of a charged scalar field @xcite .",
    "outside the context of pure qed , the influence on the vacuum energy density of a real scalar field due to an arbitrary background of an also real scalar field interpreted as a substitute for hard boundary conditions was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the gravitational case ,",
    "elizalde and romeo investigated the issue of a neutral scalar field in the presence of a static external gravitational field @xcite . a general and valuable discussion of these aspects of quantum field theory can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite too .",
    "the influence of external fields on zero - point oscillations of quantum fields confined by hard boundary conditions , however , has been investigated in some particular cases only .",
    "for example , the influence of a uniform magnetic field on the casimir effect was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the cases of a massive fermion field and of a charged scalar field both submitted to anti - periodic boundary conditions , and in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of a massive charged scalar field submitted to dirichlet boundary conditions . in the cases considered by those authors",
    "it was formally shown that the fermionic casimir effect is enhanced by the applied magnetic field while the bosonic one is inhibited . in refs .",
    "@xcite , schwinger s proper - time method @xcite was employed and explicit analytical results obtained for particular regimes of a conveniently defined dimensionless parameter @xmath5 and magnitude of the external field . in the weak magnetic field regime , some aspects of the material properties of confined charged fields were investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we wish to resume the investigation of the influence of an external magnetic field on the zero - point oscillations of charged confined quantum fields and consider the case of a massive fermion field under a uniform magnetic field and constrained by boundary conditions of the mit type , which states that the fermionic current through an hypothetical confining surface must be zero @xcite .",
    "this is not an academic question since , for instance , in the bag model of hadrons @xcite , we can expect the zero - point oscillations of the quark fields to be influenced by the strong electric and magnetic fields that permeate the interior of the hadronic bag ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we wish also to reconsider the case of a massive charged scalar field under a uniform magnetic field by investigating regimes not considered in ref . @xcite . in order to evaluate the relevant casimir energies",
    "it is convenient , especially in the case of the massive fermion field with mit boundary conditions , to follow the spirit of the representation of spectral sums as contour integrals @xcite , which allows for the incorporation of the boundary conditions in a smooth way . here",
    "we will employ a relatively simple variant of this general procedure .",
    "this variant is described in @xcite and it will be here applied without further explanation to the cases at hand ( the interested reader should consult that paper for details ) .",
    "the outline of the present work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we apply our calculational tools to the charged scalar field case . in section 3",
    ", we consider the case of the charged fermion field .",
    "for both cases , detailed numerical analysis and some special analytical limits are provided , together with an explanation of the results obtained and specific comparisons with other results .",
    "section 4 is devoted to final remarks . throughout the paper",
    "we employ natural units ( @xmath6",
    "let us first briefly consider a charged scalar field under dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field on two parallel planes separated by the distance @xmath7 whose side @xmath8 satisfies the condition @xmath9 .",

    "the unregularised casimir energy is given by @xcite@xmath10 , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are functions constructed from the boundary conditions as described in ref .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath13 takes into account the internal degrees of freedom of the quantum field .",
    "for dirichlet boundary conditions we begin by writing @xmath14 since @xmath15 is a root of @xmath16@xmath17 we divide this function by @xmath18 , thus removing @xmath15 from the set of roots without introducing a new singularity : this is equivalent to removing the zero mode .",

    "then after expanding the log we obtain , simply , @xmath29 where we have defined @xmath30 .",
    "the integral can be evaluated with the help of the mellin transform@xmath31 and after , simple manipulations , we obtain the well known result@xmath32 for @xmath33 we get the result valid for photons .",

    "the auxiliary integral then reads @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the whittaker function @xcite .",
    "the whittaker @xmath56 function is related to the modified bessel function of the third kind through @xcite@xmath57 taking the derivative of eq .",

    "such that @xmath64 , the decaying exponential behavior of the bessel functions of the third kind allows us to keep only the term corresponding to @xmath65 in the first parcel of the vacuum energy and , thus , in this limit we have@xmath66 in agreement with @xcite .",

    "the graphs of figs .",
    "1a , 1b , 2 , and 3 exhibit some representative examples .    in the first two graphs ( fig .",

    "( [ scalarbenergy0 ] ) as a function of the scaled magnetic field @xmath68 , for @xmath69 and a convenient range of @xmath70 that clearly shows the behavior of the energy ( fig .",
    "notice that initially the external field decreases the value of the vacuum energy up to a certain value of @xmath70 for which the vacuum energy attains a minimum ( which is most clearly depicted in fig . 1a ) .",
    "after reaching this point , the energy grows as remarked in ref .",
    "this situation is the opposite of what happens with a fermionic field , in which case the energy decreases linearly with @xmath70 , for large values of @xmath70 ( as will be clearly seen in the next section ) .",
    "2 shows the behavior of the energy in terms of the mass @xmath5 for a fixed value of the magnetic field @xmath70 ( chosen here as @xmath71 , but the shape of the curve is very similar for a wide range of values of @xmath70 ) .",
    "it starts at a non - zero value , for zero magnetic field .",
    "also this is quite different from the behavior in the case of a fermionic field .    finally , in fig .",

    "1 , for any other value of @xmath5 the precise shape of fig . 3 is valuable , as a way of representing the energy in terms of the unique quantity @xmath74 ( the magnetic field in units of mass squared ) .",
    "families of curves corresponding to different values of one of the variables , and also two - dimensional graphs are easy to obtain , in a reasonable amount of time , from our formulas in this section .",
    "as in the case of the charged bosons , the uniform magnetic field is here perpendicular to the ( hypothetical ) parallel mit constraining surfaces .",
    "the distance between them is @xmath7 and @xmath34 is again supposed to point towards the positive @xmath35 direction .",

    "( [ eoprime ] ) means that the term corresponding to @xmath82 must be multiplied by the factor @xmath83 .",

    "then@xmath85 the integral defined by eq .",
    "( [ thehardone ] ) is non - trivial . here",

    "( [ thehardone ] ) , however , is feasible to conveniently complete the analysis .",
    "we will show the results later .",
    "if we set @xmath87 we have to solve a much simpler integral for @xmath88 . in fact,@xmath89",
    "this integral can be evaluated with the help of ( _ cf _ formula 3.365.2 of @xcite)@xmath90 for @xmath91 this integral reads @xmath92 as can be easily seen by recalling that , for @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "there are three types of contributions to the vacuum energy : corresponding to @xmath82 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "they read@xmath97 where the integrals in the partial sums are given by @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 it follows then that the first sum can be exactly evaluated by using the eta function , @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , we have@xmath102 therefore , the casimir energy in this limit reads@xmath103 from this result we can easily extract the limit @xmath104 . due to the decaying exponential behavior of the modified bessel function , the leading contribution is given by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ ferenergymz ] ) .",
    "hence@xmath105 this result has the same sign and one fourth of the magnitude of the corresponding problem with anti - periodic boundary conditions in this same limit @xcite .",
    "this difference can be readily understood if we recall that the anti - periodicity length corresponds to @xmath106 , and that the number of allowed modes is twice the number of modes of the mit case for massless fermions .",
    "therefore , the result given by eq .",
    "( [ vacebmz ] ) , in that particular limit , is compatible with the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in this limit",
    "only the term corresponding to @xmath82 , @xmath108 , contributes .",
    "therefore , we have to calculate @xmath109 the trick to evaluate this integral we have learned it above .",
    "one should write the auxiliary integral@xmath110 and evaluate it with the help of formula given by eq .",
    "( [ grad01 ] ) .",
    "the result is@xmath111 for large values of the argument , the whittaker function behaves as @xmath112 hence for @xmath113 we can write@xmath114 and since @xmath115 _ { \\lambda = 1},\\ ] ] we finally have @xmath116 .e^{-2\\mu k}\\ ] ] the vacuum energy in this regime is given bay @xmath117 e^{-2\\mu k},\\ ] ] a result that is new and incorporates the first mass corrections .",
    "the most relevant one is the @xmath65 term , which yields @xmath118 that is sufficiently small .",
    "this is not the same result as the one obtained for anti - periodic boundary conditions though the damping exponential appears in both cases .",
    "the factors multiplying the exponential are different , it must be remembered though that for @xmath119 the mit and the ap spectra are not comparable . when @xmath120 the mit and the ap spectra for each component of the fermion field differ by a factor of 4 .      for arbitrary values of the mass and the magnetic field or ,",
    "correspondingly , of their dimensionless counterparts , @xmath5 and @xmath67 , the integral defined by ( [ thehardone ] ) is very hard to evaluate analytically .",
    "in fact , even if we would give it in terms of hypergeometric functions this would not improve our knowledge of the dependence of the energy on the mass and the magnetic field .",
    "fortunately , a numerical analysis based on eq .",
    "( [ eoprime ] ) is possible and leads to very precise , easily understandable results .    to this end , first we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eoprime ] ) under the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 ^{-k}\\left [ \\left ( y^{2}+2\\left ( p+1\\right ) t+1\\right ) ^{1/2}-1\\right ] ^{k } & \\nonumber \\\\ \\times e^{-2k\\mu \\left ( y^{2}+2\\left ( p+1\\right ) t+1\\right ) ^{1/2 } } & \\label{numanalf } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the result of the numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ numanalf ] ) for a sample of values of @xmath5 and @xmath70 is shown in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "4 shows the dependence of the energy on the magnetic field @xmath70 for different ranges of this quantity , to better show the inflexion region ( fig .",
    "4a , low values of @xmath5 ) , the intermediate region ( fig .",
    "4b ) and the asymptotic behavior for large values of @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "the intermediate region is most interesting , showing a smooth transition from the case of small magnetic field ( with a good zero field limit ) to the linear asymptotic behavior corresponding to a large field . and this situation is common for any particular value of the mass @xmath5 .",
    "the transition is given by a smooth inflexion point of nearly horizontal tangent .",
    "it looks like a minimum could almost be formed , but not quite . in fig .",
    "5 the dependence of the energy on the dimensionless mass @xmath5 is depicted , showing the behavior in the region of small mass ( fig .",
    "5a ) and the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "5b ) . needless to say , the asymptotic behavior corresponds to the the analytic expressions obtained before . for the intermediate region",
    "we see a smooth behavior connecting the two regions with a minimum that is very easily obtained with good precision , for any particular value of @xmath70 .",
    "the same observations as for the bosonic case can be done here , namely , that the graphs shown are only a very small sample of the ones that can be easily obtained from our general formulas in this section , corresponding to the fermionic case , for different values of the variables , and including two - dimensional plots .",
    "we should warn the reader , however , that the computation time is drastically increased now .",
    "in this paper we have considered the influence of an external uniform magnetic field on the casimir energy associated with charged quantum fields confined by hard boundary conditions .",
    "the method employed incorporates , in a relatively simple way , the hard boundary conditions of the dirichlet or mit type imposed , respectively , on a massive bosonic field and a massive fermionic field plus , for both cases , the effect of the magnetic field , and leads to expressions for the vacuum energy especially suited for numerical calculations .",
    "the analytical and numerical results show that , in the bosonic case and dirichlet boundary conditions , the effect of a large , applied magnetic field is to suppress the vacuum energy , and in the case of fermionic field confined in a slab - bag with mit boundary conditions , the effect of the applied field is to enhance ( in absolute magnitude ) the vacuum energy . for small and for intermediate values of the scaled magnetic field ,",
    "however , a more interesting behavior of the vacuum energy shows up . since here",
    "the calculations were performed in the general framework of an effective field theory , the details of the interaction between the quantum field and the external magnetic field represented by the generation of the landau levels and the hard boundary conditions remains hidden .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the behavior of the vacuum energy under the circumstances considered here in terms of a more fundamental model of the structure of the confined quantum vacuum .",
