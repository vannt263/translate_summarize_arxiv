    "peaks over threshold ( pot ) method have been used in a large number of scientific fields in the last decades , and the methodology is related to the theory of extreme value analysis and point process . in the literature of extreme value theory , generalized pareto distributions ( gpd )",
    "have been investigated since the early works of @xcite and @xcite . according to their results , gpd is a natural distributional model of the data that exceeds a particular designed high level .",
    "@xcite introduced point process approach for extreme value analysis and developed the modeling of threshold exceedance based on the point process theory .",
    "the classical pot models assume that those extremal events occur according to a time homogeneous poisson process . but this assumption of time homogeneity is not satisfied in some applications    @xcite generalized this idea to the case that the rate of exceedance follows a self - exciting point process ( hawkes process ) , called self - exciting peaks over threshold ( sepot ) model .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for recent contributions on this topic .",
    "hawkes process is a class of point process developed in @xcite and have been investigated in a wide range of fields such as seismology , neural science , and finance .",
    "the notable characteristic of hawkes process is the construction of intensity process which depends on the past of process itself . @xcite",
    "gave a rigorous construction of hawkes process , and mathematical properties are discussed in the paper .",
    "sepot model is applied to a data that assumed to be a realization of a ( marked ) point process in most cases of data analysis in financial econometrics .",
    "however , such an assumption may not be realistic if we regard the observed data are discrete observations of a ( marked ) point process in the case when the observation frequency increases . in the literature of high - frequency data analysis , it is usually assumed that the observed data is a discrete observation of some underlying continuous - time stochastic process : an underlying stochastic process @xmath1 , which is a semimartingale , is sampled at discrete times @xmath2 , @xmath3 and we are available the values @xmath4 .",
    "the increments @xmath5 are the discretized process of an underlying stochastic process , and point process modeling is performed to these increments in the most of empirical analysis of financial time series . in the case of high - frequency observation ,",
    "that is , the mesh @xmath6 goes to @xmath7 , it may be reasonable to consider the values @xmath4 as the discretely observed point process since a marked point process is a class of semimartingale ( see @xcite for the theoretical framework of high - frequency data analysis ) .    to fill this discrepancy between theory and empirical applications ,",
    "we develop a new framework on the discrete observation of ( marked ) point processes and investigate the discretization of sepot models .",
    "we then establish a theoretical justification of sepot methods whihc are often used in empirical analyses .",
    "the key idea of our paper is the discretization of ( marked ) hawkes process under the high - frequency observation .",
    "@xcite studied the discrete - time approximation of hawkes process and provides a limit theorem that integer - valued auto - regressive process with infinite order ( inar(@xmath0 ) ) approximately can be seen as a increments of hawkes processes .",
    "this contributes to link the ideas which have been discussed in the two different contexts , the classical statistical time series analysis and the probabilistic analysis of continuous - time stochastic process .",
    "our results are generalization of the results in @xcite to marked hawkes process , and give a new perspective in the point process approach in extreme value theory .",
    "inar(@xmath8 ) process is first defined @xcite in the context of classical discrete time series analysis for the models of count data .",
    "the theoretical development is made in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced inar(1 ) to the random coefficient ( rcinar(1 ) ) case and extended in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the stationarity of rcinar(@xmath8 ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a general review of integer - value time series models and their applications .",
    "we give some properties of rcinar(@xmath0 ) and rcinar(@xmath8 ) , and give a limit theorem on the weak convergence of rcinar(@xmath0 ) to the corresponding marked hawkes process .",
    "we also checked finite sample properties of our results by numerical experiments . in our simulation , we considered two cases : self - exciting and self - damping .",
    "the latter case means the situation that the occurrence of an event decreases the probability of occurrence of the event in the future , and such a situation can seen in the field of seismology and economics .",
    "simulation results show that the approximation of rcinar(@xmath0 ) by rcinar(@xmath8 ) is sensitive to the choice of both @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "the construction of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce a general framework on a discrete observation of ( marked ) point process . in section 3",
    ", we explain a basic result on marked point process which related to extreme value theory , and give some examples of sepot models . in section 4 ,",
    "we give some properties of rcinar(@xmath0 ) and show that rcinar(@xmath0 ) can be seen as a local approximation of a marked hawkes intensity process .",
    "we confirm finite sample properties of our results through simulations in section 5 .",
    "some directions of extension and application of our results are discussed in section 6 .",
    "we conclude this paper in section 7 .",
    "proofs are gathered in appendix a.",
    "in this section we introduce a new framework on a discrete observation of point process models .",
    "most of papers on an empirical analysis of financial time series in which ( marked ) point process models are used treat the observed data as a realization of a latent ( marked ) point process .",
    "however , such an assumption on the data is not realistic if we stand in a position that the observations are discrete samples of an underlying point process .",
    "for example , in financial econometrics , increasing interests have been paid on high - frequency data analysis of asset prices which is observed typically in every one seconds . in high - frequency financial data analysis , it is usually assumed that the observed data are discrete observations of a semimartingale , or a continuous time stochastic process for the mathematical treatment of observations . therefore , there is a void in high - frequency data analysis between mathematical assumptions based on a semimartingale theory and empirical applications based on point process models . for this reason ,",
    "we attempt to develop a mathematical framework that links these two different points of view in this paper .",
    "first we introduce a general framework on the discrete observation of point processes , then we focus on the discrete observation of marked self - exciting process , known as marked hawkes process .",

    "such events are assumed to be a realization of an under lying point process in empirical financial time series analysis . to explain this assumption mathematically , we introduce the following stochastic process : @xmath22 ) \\over j_{l}},\\quad ( k-1)\\delta \\leq t \\leq k\\delta.\\ ] ] the stochastic process @xmath23 varies at most @xmath24 at each observation time @xmath2 . in most of empirical studies ,",

    "in this section , we see the relation between point process and extreme value theory for the purpose of the discretization of sepot models discussed in section 4 . in section 3 and section 4 ,",
    "we consider the weak convergence of point processes .",
    "hence we first explain the concept .",
    "let @xmath28 be a complete separable metric space , @xmath29 be the space of all point measures defined on @xmath28 , and @xmath30 be the family of all non - negative continuous functions defined on @xmath28 with compact support .",
    "we can construct a topology on @xmath29 based on the concept of vague convergence : for @xmath31 , we say @xmath32 converge vaguely to @xmath33 if @xmath34 for any @xmath35 .",

    "a point process is defined as a random variable from some stochastic space @xmath38 to the measurable space @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we can use the argument of weak convergence of random variables on a metric space developed in @xcite .",
    "it is also known that for ( marked ) point processes , the weak convergence of a point process is equivalent to the weak convergence of finite dimensional distributions are equivalent ( theorem 11.1.iv in @xcite ) . in the following sections , we use the notation @xmath40 as weak convergence .",

    ".    case ii corresponds to the case when a hawkes process has _ self - damping _ property .",
    "this setting would be suggestive to see the asymptotic behavior of @xmath202 when a decay function @xmath97 could take negative values .",
    "self - damping is one of the recent important problem in financial econometrics .",
    "the problem is discussed in section 6 .",
    "we also considered three cases for the mesh @xmath217 ( we call these cases as a , b and c ) . in figure 1 ,",
    "decay functions @xmath218 and @xmath219 are plotted .",

    "we first find that as the mesh @xmath226 get small , @xmath184 tends to take @xmath7 or @xmath24 .",
    "this is quite natural because @xmath184 is an approximation of the increment of the limiting simple point process in theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "we can see this in the center two figures in figure 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "second , in case ii - a , b and c ( these case are shown in the bottom right in figures 2 , 3 and 4 ) , the scales conditional mean of @xmath184 take negative value and values which are close to zero .",
    "this is because of the form of the decay function @xmath219 : in case ii , @xmath227 and @xmath228 are close although @xmath229 .",
    "third , in case i - c and ii - c ( the bottom two figures in figure 4 ) , the scales conditional mean of @xmath184 is less smooth compared with case i - b and ii - b ( the bottom two figures in figure 3 ) in the interval that no events occur .",
    "this difference may come from the approximation of rcinar(@xmath0 ) by rcinar(@xmath8 ) .",
    "this implies that we have to set more large @xmath8 as @xmath226 goes to @xmath7 .",
    "in this section we first discuss about an extension of our results and then about an application of theorem [ thm1 ] to a statistical modeling of financial time series .    for the extension of _ self - exciting _ pot model to the multivariate case , we have to consider multivariate hawkes process , which is called _ mutually exciting _ process , and a multivariate mark distribution ( a joint jump size distribution ) . in the univariate sepot model ,",
    "past events are usually considered to amplify the chance of occurrence of the same type of events in some cases ( the decay function @xmath97 is always nonnegative ) . however , in multivariate point process model , the event occurrence of a component could tend to reduce the event occurring probability of other components and in this case , decay function can be negative .",
    "this case is called _ mutually - damping _ and _ self - damping _ in the univariate case . mutually - damping could happen in a high - frequency financial trading for example .",
    "some trading activity reduces the possibility of future trading activity and has an adverse impact on its intensity . @xcite",
    "discuss the detection of self - excitation of events based on a general semimartingale theory .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigate nonparametric estimation of decay function of ordinary hawkes process ( hawkes process with no marks ) , and in their real data analysis , some estimated decay functions take negative values",
    ". therefore , self-(or mutually-)damping is a both theoretically and practically important problem .",
    "moreover , the modeling of multivariate sepot model is related to the modeling of multivariate generalized pareto distribution",
    ". these topics in the field of extreme value theory are presently under discussion . @xcite and @xcite are important contributions in the theoretical and empirical standpoint of this topic",
    ".    for the statistical application of theorem [ thm1 ] , bayesian modeling of discrete - time sepot model may be possible .",
    "as noted in @xcite we can replace poisson thinning operator in definition [ rcinar ] with binomial thinning operator : @xmath230 the _ binomial _ rcinar would be convenient for mcmc methodology and may enable us to use non - i.i.d . jump size distribution .",
    "we refer to @xcite for bayesian estimation procedures of inar(@xmath8 ) .",
    "in this paper we introduced the general framework on the discrete observation of point process under the high - frequency observation .",
    "grounded on this framework , we investigated the relation between rcinar(@xmath0 ) process and marked hawkes process and gave a necessary and sufficient condition of the stationarity of rcinar(@xmath0 ) and its rcar(@xmath0 ) representation to build a bridge between the discrete - time series analysis and the analysis of continuous - time stochastic process .",
    "as applications of our results , we established the theoretical justification of self - exciting peaks over threshold models , which have been used in empirical financial time series analysis .",
