    "with the advent of the rhic at bnl we have a new facility to study the spin structure of the proton,(for a review on the potential of rhic [ 1 ] ) , which supplements the existing polarized lepton - hadron machines . polarized proton - proton collisions with a very high luminosity and a maximum centre of mass energy 500 gev will provide us with many more details about spin distributions than possible with the existing lepton - hadron machines , which give very little information about the polarized gluon and sea - quark parton densities .",
    "the production of lepton pairs in hadron collisions , the drell - yan process [ 2 ] , is one of the most powerful tools to probe the structure of hadrons .",
    "its parton model interpretation is straightforward - the process is induced by the annihilation of a quark - antiquark pair into a virtual photon which subsequently decays into a lepton pair .",
    "the drell - yan process in proton - proton or proton - nucleus collisions therefore provides a direct probe of the antiquark densities in protons and nuclei . since the appearance of the data obtained in the emc experiment [ 3 ] ,",
    "many studies have been devoted to the spin structure of the proton . in the lowest order of perturbative qcd",
    ", the spin of the proton can be represented as the sum of three terms ; that is , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , quark and gluon contributions to the proton spin respectively , and @xmath8 is the contribution of the orbital angular momentum of quarks and gluons .",
    "the experimental results reported in [ 4 - 6 ] suggest that the gluon spin and orbital interaction contribute significantly to the proton spin .",
    "naturally , these experimental results require a theoretical explanation .",
    "gehrmann [ 7 ] calculated @xmath9 correction to @xmath10 and @xmath11 distributions of dileptons produced in collisions of longitudinally polarized hadrons .",
    "he also showed that measurement of the longitudinally polarized cross section for the drell - yan process would make it possible to investigate the distribution of polarized sea quarks in hadrons .    in [ 8 ] , the longitudinal - transverse spin asymmetries @xmath12 in drell - yan processes",
    "were calculated in the leading order for nucleon - nucleon collisions at rhic energies .",
    "it was shown that @xmath13 is much less than the respective transverse - transverse asymmetry @xmath14 .",
    "the drell - yan process at high transverse momenta of the dilepton was studied in [ 9 ] , where the effect of @xmath15 - @xmath16 -interference was also taken into consideration .",
    "both single - spin and double - spin asymmetries were investigated there .",
    "it was shown that the double - spin asymmetry at small invariant masses of the lepton pair and the single - spin asymmetry at the @xmath17 - peak becomes significant .    also ,",
    "as it was demonstrated in our work [ 10 ] single - spin and double -spin asymmetries in @xmath18 processes induced by collisions of polarized hadrons are analyzed on the basis of qcd and electroweak interaction .",
    "here it is shown that the contribution of the @xmath17 boson processes into polarized particles , in general , and into the single - spin parity - violating asymmetries in particular , is significant .",
    "the single - spin asymmetries become large , both in the clw and in the grsw models , as the dilepton invariant mass approaches the @xmath17- boson mass . double - spin asymmetry for all",
    "the considered @xmath19 is greather than the single - spin asymmetry for all the values of the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "collisions of polarized hadrons are among processes of greater importance for study of the spin structure of the proton and for calculation of the distributions of polarized quarks in the proton .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we shall give some formulae for the amplitudes and the differentrial cross section for calculations single - and the double - spin asymmetries , in section 3 we present the numerical results and discuss the asymmetries . in section 4 , we draw our conclusions .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate contribution superstring @xmath20 boson to the single - spin and double - spin asymmetries in @xmath21 processes for studying the spin structure of the proton .",
    "there is currently vigorous research on @xmath1 theory in elementary particle physics . in the low - energy limit ,",
    "the @xmath1 group may be split up into subgroups of fifth or sixth ranks [ 11 ] : @xmath22 @xmath23    one additional neutral vector field @xmath24 arises in group @xmath25 , which correspond to @xmath26 symmetry . in group @xmath27 , we have two additional neutral boson fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which correspond to @xmath30 and @xmath31 symmetries respectively . a model having the gauge group @xmath32 is now considered as the permissible low - energy limit in superstring theory .",
