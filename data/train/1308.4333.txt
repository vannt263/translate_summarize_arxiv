    "conformal field theory ( cft ) provides exact critical exponents of infinite families of 2d pure models  @xcite .",

    ", we investigate the disordered o(@xmath0 ) loop model , another nontrivial case where randomness is relevant ( for @xmath14  @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of self - duality `` on average '' makes its study considerably harder than the case of the rbpm , but this effort is rewarded by a richer phase diagram ( fig .",

    "for instance , uphill flow along the randomness was predicted @xcite and confirmed numerically @xcite for the rbpm with @xmath45 . in the vicinity of the pure fps",
    ", the relation between the landscape gradient and the rg flow can be determined numerically with the aid of the harris criterion @xcite . as we describe below , in most cases , the direction of the flow for weak randomness is uphill along the randomness while it is downhill along the temperature .. ] in contrast to the rbpm , one can not exactly determine the critical averaged temperature of the random fp because of the absence of self - duality ( corresponding to the appearance of @xmath46 on the right - hand side of the operator product expansion @xmath47 , except for @xmath48 ) .",

    "we choose @xmath62 so that the errors due to finiteness of @xmath63 and randomness are comparable .",

    "the location of @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) for the honeycomb lattice model is @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) with @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "third , the loop model at @xmath77 acquires an enhanced symmetry due to the prohibition of empty vertices , realizing the fp ( * f * ) of the fully - packed loop model with @xmath78  @xcite .",

    "we clarify universality classes of * r * and * s * along the critical line * prsz * , while the detailed study along the zero - temperature @xmath95 , and especially the nature of * z * is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "the valley * v * between * d * and * p * in @xmath96 , where the pure model has no fps , is most likely a numerical artifact as it becomes narrower as @xmath63 increases .",

    "our numerics show that * p * becomes a saddle point ( a peak ) for @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "since the harris criterion  @xcite tells us that the flow should deviate from ( return to ) * p * in its vicinity for @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , we conclude that the rg flow along the critical line corresponds to the uphill direction , consistent with the non - unitary variant of the @xmath44-theorem  @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the case with @xmath0 slightly below @xmath105 . the ridge in fig .",
