    "recently the subject of quantum channels has catalysed the attention for its usefulness in foundational issues as well as in technological applications ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "formally a quantum channel is a completely positive and trace preserving map acting on the set of states ( density operators ) living in a hilbert space .",
    "since any physical process involves a state change , it can be regarded as a quantum channel mapping the initial ( input ) state to the final ( output ) state . as such",
    "it can be characterized in terms of its information transmission capability .",
    "this implies the use of entropic functionals among which the minimum output entropy plays a dominant role .",
    "in fact it is related to the minimum amount of noise inherent to the channel , since it quantifies the minimum uncertainty occurring at the output of a channel when inputting pure states .",
    "more precisely , the output entropy measures the entanglement of the input pure state with the environment .",
    "being this latter not accessible , such entanglement induces loss of quantum coherence and thus injection of noise at the channel output .",
    "clearly , low values of entanglement , i.e. , of output entropy , correspond to low communication noise . as a consequence ,",
    "the study of output entropy yields useful insights about channel capacities .",
    "in particular , an upper bound on the classical capacity can be derived from a lower bound on the output entropy of multiple channel uses @xcite .",
    "when studying quantum channels a dichotomy between discrete and continuous channels usually appears .",
    "the formers act on states living in finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "in contrast the latter act on states living in infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this is reflected in the possibility of using discrete or continuous variables where to encode classical information . among continuous quantum channels attention",
    "has been almost exclusively devoted to gaussian quantum channels , that is channels mapping gaussian input states into gaussian output ones @xcite .",
    "the reason is that they are easily implementable at experiment level and moreover they also handy at theoretical level .",
    "for these channels the minimum output entropy was largely investigated @xcite and then showed that actually their classical capacity is achieved through states minimizing the output entropy @xcite .    here , we go beyond the restriction of gaussianity of continuous quantum channels and propose a model of non - gaussian quantum channel that stems from the combination of two physically relevant processes that occur in open quantum systems , namely amplitude damping and dephasing .",
    "we then analytically find input states approaching zero output entropy , while respecting the input energy constraint .",
    "they consist in the superposition of two number states the farthest away one from the other . in truncated hilbert space , we find that beside superposition of two number states , the so - called binomial states @xcite can be optimal depending on the value of channels parameters . we support this latter results by numerical investigations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mod ] we introduce the model and then we show the existence of optimal input states achieving zero output entropy in section [ sec : optinput ] .",
    "subsequently , in section [ sec : spacetruncation ] , we restrict our attention to truncated hilbert space and we conjecture about the optimality of binomial states , beside superposition of two number states , and we give numerical evidences of this idea .",
