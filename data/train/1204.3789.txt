    "the time - dependence of @xmath2 is caused by two effects : one is the linear growth , and the other is the _ non - linear _ growth .",
    "the former effect is caused by dark energy slowing down the growth of structure , leading to a decay of @xmath2 .",
    "the latter effect is caused by non - linear evolution of density fluctuations , leading to a growth of @xmath2 .",

    "empirical approaches , which are calibrated using @xmath49-body simulations , have an advantage that they can , in principle , describe the matter power spectrum in a highly non - linear regime where the perturbative expansion breaks down .",

    "the matter power spectrum is decomposed into two pieces : one that arises from two - point correlations between dark matter particles residing in two different dark matter halos ( 2-halo term ) , and another that arises from two - point correlations between dark matter particles residing in a single dark matter halo ( 1-halo term ) .",
    "the former contribution is given approximately by the linear matter power spectrum , whereas the latter contribution is given by the density profile of dark matter halos .",
    "this splitting between the 2- and 1-halo terms is somewhat artificial , and thus the halo model approach would not provide an accurate description of the non - linear matter power spectrum , unless it is calibrated by numerical simulations .",

    "<S> the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) generated by a correlation between a time - dependent gravitational potential and the weak gravitational lensing effect provides a direct measurement of the influence of dark energy on cmb . </S>",
    "<S> this bispectrum is also known to yield the most important contamination of the so - called `` local - form '' primordial bispectrum , which can be used to rule out all single - field inflation models . in this paper , we reexamine the effect of non - linear matter clustering on this bispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we compare three different approaches : the 3rd - order perturbation theory ( 3pt ) , and two empirical fitting formulae available in the literature , finding that detailed modeling of non - linearity appears to be not very important , as most of the signal - to - noise comes from the squeezed triangle , for which the correlation in the linear regime dominates . </S>",
    "<S> the expected signal - to - noise ratio for an experiment dominated by the cosmic variance up to @xmath0 is about 5 , which is much smaller than the previous estimates including non - linearity , but agrees with the estimates based on the linear calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the difference between the linear and non - linear predictions is undetectable , and does not alter the contamination of the local - form primordial non - gaussianity . </S>"
