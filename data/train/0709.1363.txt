    "conclusions will be presented in section  [ sec::conclusions ] .",
    "in most computations , dr of an @xmath58-electron target ion in the initial state @xmath59 is handled as a two  step process in which first an electron is captured resonantly from the continuum forming an @xmath60-electron state @xmath61 with the captured electron and one of the target core electrons both now in an excited level . in a second step , this doubly excited state either decays radiatively by the emission of one or more photons to some final state @xmath62 which lies below the ionization threshold of the ion , or it returns by auger electron emission to the initial ionization stage of the target . if interference between the radiative and nonradiative capture of the electron in the field of the target is negligible , the integrated dr cross section for an isolated resonance , the so  called resonance strength , can be expressed in terms of the auger and radiative rates of the intermediate state @xmath61 by @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the wave number and @xmath65 the energy of the incident electron , @xmath66 the width of the doubly  excited state , and @xmath67 is the rate for the dielectronic capture from the initial into the doubly excited state . using the principle of detailed balance , the dielectronic capture rate @xmath67 is equal to @xmath68 $ ] where @xmath69 is the auger rate , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the statistical factors of the initial and intermediate states , respectively .",
    "@xmath72 refers to the rate for the radiative stabilization to the state @xmath62 .",
    "the strength as defined by equation  ( [ eq::resonance - strength ] ) refers to the area under the dr cross section curve .",
    "hence , it is usually given in units of @xmath73 .",
    "the total width @xmath66 is determined by all possible decay channels of the resonant state @xmath61 and is given , in first ",
    "order perturbation theory , by @xmath74 where the sums are over all the individual auger and radiative rates ( widths ) of the intermediate state @xmath75 .",
    "the use of the resonance strength @xmath76 is appropriate for resonances whose width @xmath66 is small compared to its energy position @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the energy of the doubly excited state and initial state of the target ion , respectively , and if the energy dependent dr cross section has a lorentzian profile @xcite @xmath80 owing to the energy of the incident electron [ cf .  the @xmath81 factor in @xmath82 , the resonance strength increases rapidly towards the dr threshold and makes the process sensitive to low kinetic energies of the incoming electrons .",
    "at storage rings , the radiative stabilization is often not observed explicitly and , hence in equation  ( [ eq::resonance - strength ] ) , the radiative rate for the individual transition @xmath83 has to be replaced with @xmath84 where the summation extends over all states @xmath85 below the ionization threshold that can be reached by radiative transition from the doubly excited state @xmath61 . as seen from equation  ( [ eq::resonance - strength ] ) , the observed dr strength for a given resonance is proportional to the capture rate @xmath67 and the total radiative rate . for most light and medium elements , moreover , the magnitude of the resonance strengths is often determined by the radiative decay since the emission of photons from the doubly excited state is then much slower than its autoionization and , hence , @xmath86 .",
    "the doubly excited state @xmath61 is often one out of a large number of highly correlated states embedded in the continuum of the target ion . for these resonances ,",
    "special care has to be taken in calculating both the individual as well as total rates accurately . to describe the ground and excited state of multiply charged ions ,",
    "the mcdf method has been found to be a versatile tool for the computation of the many ",
    "electron energies and decay properties , especially if inner  shell electrons or several open shells are involved in the computations @xcite . in the mcdf method ,",
    "an atomic state is approximated by a linear combination of so  called configuration state functions ( csf ) of the same symmetry @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of csf , @xmath89 denotes the representation of the atomic state in this csf basis , @xmath90 is the parity , @xmath91 is the total angular momentum , and @xmath92 is a set of quantum numbers for a unique specifying of the many - electron basis states . in most standard computations ,",
    "the csf are constructed as antisymmetrized products of a common set of orthonormal orbitals and are optimized on the basis of the dirac  coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "further relativistic contributions to the representation @xmath89 of the atomic states are then added , owing to the given requirements , by diagonalizing the dirac  coulomb ",
    "breit hamiltonian matrix in first ",
    "order perturbation theory .",
    "for multiply charged ions , an estimate of the dominant qed contributions ( i.e. , the self  energy and vacuum polarization of the electronic cloud ) might be taken into account by means of scaled hydrogenic values .",
    "but qed plays a negligible role for si@xmath93 ions in the present analysis .",
    "obviously , the calculation of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the intermediate resonances @xmath61 is central to the computation of any dr spectrum which is to be compared with experiment . in the mcdf model , both the radiative as well as",
    "the auger matrix elements are derived from computation of the corresponding interaction matrix within the csf basis using the expansion ( [ eq::asfansatz ] ) . to determine the rates ,",
    "the wave functions from the grasp92 @xcite and ratip @xcite codes have been applied in the present work which allows one to incorporate both the dominant relativistic and correlation effects on the same footings . however , since the computation of the transition probabilities has been considered at many places elsewhere @xcite , we shall mention here only that the radiative rates @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the emitted photon s frequency , are associated with the reduced matrix elements of the interaction @xmath96 of the atomic electrons with the multipole components of the radiation field @xcite , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 refer to electric and magnetic multipoles , respectively , with the multipolarity @xmath99 . for light and medium elements , it is of course sufficient to include the electric  dipole ( @xmath100 , @xmath98 ) decay while the contributions from higher multipoles to the radiative stabilization remain negligible . to obtain the total radiative rate , i.e. , to include the summation over all lower states @xmath101 in equation  ( [ eq::total - width ] ) , often a large number of transition rates have to be compiled with similar accuracy .",
    "for this reason the computation of the dr spectrum at higher energies may become difficult . in the ratip program ,",
    "the transition probabilities are computed by the reos component @xcite including , if appropriate , the rearrangement of the electron density in course of the decay .",
    "the explicit consideration of the electron density s rearrangement was not included here , because this would require separate calculations for the intermediate resonance states and the final states of the radiative stabilization . in the present calculations , however , both sets of states were always treated together in order to keep the computations feasible .    unlike the treatment of radiative stabilization , calculation of the auger rates requires the coupling of the bound  state electrons ( of the target ion ) to the electron continuum .",
    "if , for the sake of simplicity , we neglect the interaction between different auger channels ( i.e.  _ within the continuum _ ) , the auger rates are given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the atomic hamiltonian , @xmath78 the total energy of the doubly excited state and @xmath104 the kinetic energy of the emitted electron .",
    "in equation  ( [ eq::aa - rate ] ) , the summation over @xmath105 for @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the angular momentum and total angular momentum , respectively , of the incoming or outgoing electron , extends over all partial waves of the outgoing electron which can be coupled to the target ion state @xmath109 with the condition to conserve the total angular momentum @xmath110 and parity @xmath111 of the intermediate state .",
    "if , moreover , a common set of _ orthonormal _ orbitals is used for the representation of the intermediate state @xmath61 and the final ionic states @xmath112 , then the operator @xmath113 can be replaced by the electron  electron interaction operator . for most light and medium elements , it is again sufficient to include the instantaneous coulomb repulsion between the electrons but to omit the relativistic breit contributions as they were found important only for the auger emission of highly  charged ions @xcite .    the restriction of the electron ",
    "electron interaction in the computation of the matrix elements in equation  ( [ eq::aa - rate ] ) is common practice , even though the orbital functions for the doubly excited state @xmath61 and the final ionic state @xmath112 are not quite orthogonal to each other .",
    "this treatment has been implemented therefore also in the auger component of the ratip program , in which the continuum spinors are solved within a spherical but level  dependent potential of the final ion ( the so  called _ optimal level _ scheme in the grasp92 program ) .",
    "this scheme also includes the exchange interaction of the emitted electron with the bound  state density .",
    "often , the number of the possible scattering states @xmath114 of a system increases rapidly with the number of intermediate ion states as the free electrons may couple in quite different ways to the bound",
    " state electrons . for further details on the computations of the auger matrix elements and relative intensities , we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "apart from the individual rates , any helpful calculation of dr spectra critically depends on the proper control and handling of the various decay branches which , at least in principle , should be treated on the same basis in order to obtain a consistent spectrum .",
    "this need for an efficient handling of the decay channels concerns those open - shell configurations in which one - particle excitations with large principal quantum numbers ` mix into ' the low - energy part of the dr spectrum .",
    "such a mixing occurs especially for the excitation of electrons beneath the valence shell whose energies are comparable with the valence excitation into rydberg states .",
    "therefore , in order to facilitate this handling of the various decay branches , a new component ( dierec ) has been developed recently in the framework of the ratip program .",
    "this component now supports both , the computation of individual @xmath76 and total resonance strengths @xmath115 and enables us to _ simulate _ the low  energy dr spectra as observed by experiment . internally",
    ", of course , this new component makes use of the reos and auger components from above and allows us , if necessary , to incorporate also higher multipoles in the computation of the ( total ) radiative rates .",
    "because of the finite  difference method of the grasp92 and ratip programs and owing to the associated size of the configuration expansions , however , excitation to states with principal quantum numbers @xmath116 can often not be treated by the code explicitly .",
    "atomic structure codes , such as , e.g. , autostructure @xcite , that are geared towards the generation of dr rate coefficients for plasma physical applications , treat high-@xmath117 electrons within a hydrogenic approximation .",
    "this has not yet been implemented in the ratip program suite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the heavy - ion storage ring tsr of the max - planck - institut fr kernphysik ( mpi - k ) in heidelberg , germany .",
    "details of the merged - beams technique using the mpi - k electron cooler have been described previously @xcite .    in the present experiment",
    "a beam of @xmath118si@xmath93 was provided by the tandem accelerator of the mpi - k linear accelerator facility at an energy of about @xmath119 .",
    "the ion beam was injected into the storage ring where it was collinearly overlapped with the cooler electron beam . for efficient electron cooling",
    ", the electron velocity has to be close to the ion velocity in the ring . to fulfill this velocity - matching condition ,",
    "the laboratory energy of the electrons was set to the ` cooling ' energy @xmath120 .",
    "the beam current was accumulated by multi - turn injection and ` ecool stacking ' @xcite .",
    "ion currents of typically @xmath121@xmath122 were reached .",
    "in contrast to previous experiments , where the electron beam of the cooler was also used as an electron target for recombination experiments , in the present experiment a newly installed separate electron beam @xcite was used .",
    "this additional electron beam is hereafter denoted as the electron target . as in the electron cooler ,",
    "the electron beam of the electron target is also guided by a magnetic field and overlaps the ion beam in a straight section of @xmath123 length .",
    "conceptually , the experimental procedures for measuring recombination rate coefficients with the electron target are the same as those applied previously with the electron cooler . however , there are advantages when a separate electron target is employed for recombination measurements .",
    "first , the electron cooler can be used continuously for the cooling of the ion beam .",
    "thus , the low velocity and spatial spread of the ion beam is maintained at all times .",
    "second , the electron target was specifically designed for providing an electron beam with a very low initial energy spread @xcite .",
    "both advantages yield a higher experimental resolution in the present measurement as compared to previous measurements using only the electron cooler .",
    "after injection into the storage ring , the ions were cooled for a few seconds before the recombination measurements started .",
    "recombined ions were separated from the circulating beam in the first dipole magnet downstream of the electron target and counted by a single particle scintillation detector with nearly @xmath124 efficiency . during the recombination measurement , the electron energy of the electron target beam was alternatingly chopped between measurement ( @xmath125 ) and reference ( @xmath126 ) energies by switching the acceleration voltage for the target electron beam accordingly . at the same time",
    "the electron cooler was held constant at cooling energy .",
    "the reference measurement was made to determine detector background .",
    "therefore , the reference energy @xmath126 was chosen in a range of the spectrum where no dr resonances occurred .",
    "the measurement and reference interval of data collection were @xmath127 each . between the voltage jump and the data collection interval",
    "there was a settling time of @xmath128 to allow the power supplies to reach the preset values .",

    "is set to @xmath142 which is the length of the solenoid providing the axial magnetic field along the interaction region .",
    "for the detailed analysis we applied a toroid correction @xcite that accounts for the contribution of the merging and de - merging sections in the toroidal magnetic fields of the electron target . the ion velocity and the electron velocity are @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively , where @xmath145 is the speed of light . under the present conditions ,",

    "the systematic experimental uncertainty of the merged - beams rate coefficient is estimated to be @xmath149 at @xmath150 confidence level .",
