    "over the past several decades , observations of magnetic activity in stars of spectral type f  m have uncovered a variety of correlations between the different activity indicators , as well as between the level of activity and properties such as stellar rotation and age .",
    "coronal x - ray emission , transition region uv emission , chromospheric h@xmath0 emission , and non - thermal radio emission increase with both rotation and youth ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and are temporally and energetically correlated in quiescence and during flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these observations have led to a general paradigm of magnetic field amplification at the shearing interface between the radiative and convective zones  the so - called @xmath10 dynamo @xcite .",
    "this dynamo operates through a combination of stretching by differential rotation ( @xmath11 ) and twisting by convective motions ( @xmath0 ) .    in quiescence ,",
    "the dynamo - generated fields provide a heating source for the chromospheres and coronae primarily through magnetic waves and field dissipation on small scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay between the chromosphere , transition region , and corona is not fully understood , but is known to involve a complex combination of radiation , conduction , and mass flows . in dme stars it has been proposed that the transition region and chromosphere are instead heated by coronal x - rays , leading to the observed typical luminosity ratios of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to quiescent emission , sudden and large - scale dissipation of the field through large - scale magnetic reconnection may lead to particle acceleration and evaporation of the lower atmosphere into the chromosphere , transition region , and corona , giving rise to correlated radio , x - ray , uv , and h@xmath0 flares ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the level of activity increases with faster rotation , but eventually saturates at @xmath14 and @xmath15 for rotation periods of @xmath16 d in f ",
    "it remains unclear whether this trend reflects a saturation of the dynamo itself or secondary centrifugal effects such as coronal stripping or sweeping of the field toward the poles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these activity trends continue to hold even beyond spectral type @xmath17 , where the stellar interiors become fully convective and the @xmath10 dynamo can no longer operate .",
    "indeed , the level of x - ray and h@xmath0 activity peaks in mid m dwarfs at saturated levels @xcite",
    ". this suggests that whatever dynamo mechanism operates in these low mass stars , it is already present in higher mass objects , and becomes increasingly dominant beyond spectral type m3 .",
    "however , the level of x - ray and h@xmath0 activity drops precipitously beyond spectral type m7 , reaching mostly non - detectable levels by spectral type l5 .",
    "this decrease is accompanied by a clear transition from quiescent emission to flares in the few percent of active objects @xcite .",
    "these trends point to a change in the dynamo mechanism , the field configuration , and/or the field dissipation process .",
    "radio observations , however , have uncovered a substantial fraction of active late m and l dwarfs ( @xmath18 or higher ; @xcite ) , which exhibit both quiescent and flaring emission @xcite . unlike the trend in h@xmath0 and x - rays , the level of radio activity appears to _ increase _ with later spectral type @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is orders of magnitude brighter than expected based on the radio / x - ray correlations that are observed in stars down to spectral type m6 , and requires magnetic fields of @xmath19 kg with order unity filling factor sustained over timescales of at least several years @xcite .",
    "thus , contrary to evidence from x - rays and h@xmath0 , a substantial fraction of ultracool dwarfs continue to generate and dissipate magnetic fields .    in order to investigate the field generation and dissipation in detail , we have recently initiated a program of simultaneous , multi - wavelength observations of ultracool dwarfs .",
    "such observations are required to trace the temporal evolution of flares across the corona , transition region , and chromosphere , and to study the relation between particle acceleration and heating , particularly in the context of the known correlations in f ",
    "m stars . in a previous paper ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) we presented observations of the m8.5 rapid rotator , which exhibited a wide range of temporally uncorrelated emission in the radio , h@xmath0 , and x - rays . these included quiescent radio emission from a large - scale field , radio flares from a tangled field component with @xmath20 kg , and periodic h@xmath0 emission matching the stellar rotation period with an inferred hot spot covering about @xmath21 of the stellar photosphere . in addition , the quiescent h@xmath0 emission exceeded the x - ray luminosity by about a factor of two , likely ruling out coronal x - ray emission as the source of chromospheric heating .",
    "here we present observations of the m8 and m8.5 dwarfs  and , both of which are known to exhibit magnetic activity .",
    "we find substantially different behavior in each of these two objects , with correlated x - ray / uv flares and quiescent emission in , and uncorrelated radio / h@xmath0 emission in .",
    "along with , the mixed behavior in late m dwarfs thus indicates a transition in the properties of the magnetic field and its dissipation in this spectral type range .",
    "we show that rotation may play at least a partial role in explaining these trends .",
    "we chose to target the nearby dwarf stars  and  due to previous detections of activity from these objects in the optical / uv / x - ray and radio bands , respectively .",

[ [ sec : lsr ] ]    the broad - band emission properties of  are summarized in figure  [ fig : lsrall ] .",
    "the radio emission appears to be nearly constant both in total intensity and circular polarization .",
    "the average flux density is @xmath88 @xmath26jy , while the @xmath89 upper limit on the fraction of circular polarization is @xmath90 . for comparison",

    "we note the possible detection of one weak flare ( at 08:05 ut ) with a peak flux density of about 1.3 mjy and a duration of about 5 min ( figure  [ fig : lsrall ] ) .",
    "the average flux density during the putative flare is only @xmath92 @xmath26jy above the quiescent emission level , and the average fraction of circular polarization is @xmath93 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the radio emission from  is generally persistent in origin , with at most a mild variability at the level of @xmath94 on hour to year timescales .",
    "the one possible short duration flare points to a duty cycle of less than a few percent if the flare distribution is uniform .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that we observed  in a period of relative quiescence , and future observations may reveal the existence of flares with a higher duty cycle .    since our radio observation covers nearly 4 rotation periods of , the lack of significant variability points to emission from a uniform and stable magnetic field configuration . assuming a structure with @xmath95 cm we infer a brightness temperature , @xmath96 k , indicative of non - thermal gyrosynchrotron emission .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the overall persistence of the radio emission and the low fraction of circular polarization .    in the context of gyrosynchrotron radiation the emission spectrum",
    "is determined by the size of the emitting region ( @xmath97 ) , the density of radiating electrons ( @xmath98 ) , and the magnetic field strength ( @xmath99 ) according to @xcite : @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight . using a range of @xmath104 we find @xmath105 g , respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath106 ghz , we find @xmath107 cm , and @xmath108 @xmath109 ; the latter is for the range @xmath110 .",
    "typical coronal densities in m dwarfs are @xmath111 @xmath109 @xcite , suggesting that @xmath112 , and hence @xmath113 g and @xmath114 . since the corona is likely to have an overall shell geometry , the derived physical properties can be interpreted as a structure extending @xmath115 above the stellar photosphere with order unity filling factor .",
    "smaller filling factors will lead to more extended magnetic structures .    with strong persistent radio emission and no corresponding x - ray emission ,",

    "m6 active stars and in solar flares .",
    "we find @xmath117 hz@xmath9 , more than four orders of magnitude in excess of the expected value ; figure  [ fig : gb ] .",
    "we stress that the long - term persistence and low circular polarization of the radio emission clearly point to gyrosynchrotron radiation from a stellar - scale magnetic field , so the severe violation can not be explained away with small - scale , short - duration heating by coherent processes such as electron cyclotron maser or plasma radiation .",
    "we next turn to the h@xmath0 emission for which we measure a range of equivalent widths of @xmath118   ( figure  [ fig : lsrall ] ) .",
    "this range corresponds to @xmath119 , about an order of magnitude lower than the saturated h@xmath0 emission found in mid m dwarfs .",
    "the weaker chromospheric emission from  is in good agreement with the general trend of decreasing h@xmath0 emission in ultracool dwarfs .    as in the case of the radio emission , the level of detected h@xmath0 emission is puzzling in the context of the non - detected x - ray emission .",
    "observations of m0m6 dwarfs reveal a typical ratio , @xmath120 , with a full range of @xmath121 @xcite . for",
    "this ratio is @xmath122 ( using the weakest h@xmath0 flux ) , at least an order of magnitude larger than in m0m6 dwarfs .",
    "the significantly brighter h@xmath0 emission indicates that chromospheric heating is significantly more efficient in  than coronal heating , possibly as a result of the field configuration .",
    "we return to this point in  [ sec : rot ] .",
    "moreover , the elevated h@xmath0 emission rules out coronal x - ray emission as the source of chromospheric heating , as proposed for dme stars .    while both radio and h@xmath0 emission are detected , we find a clear lack of temporal correlation between these two activity indicators .",
    "the h@xmath0 light curve exhibits significant variability on timescales of @xmath1 hr , with a wide range of amplitudes , @xmath123  .",
    "however , no clear radio variability is observed in coincidence with any of the h@xmath0 brightening episodes . in particular , during the large increase in h@xmath0 equivalent width centered on 13:40 ut ( figure  [ fig : lsrall ] ) , we find a limit of @xmath124 on the variability of the radio emission .",
    "this can be explained in two ways .",
    "first , the h@xmath0 variability originates from much smaller physical scales than the radio emission ( for which @xmath125 ) , and any associated radio variability is therefore dwarfed by the overall persistent flux . in this case , we infer that the typical scale of chromospheric regions giving rise to h@xmath0 variability is @xmath6 of the overall chromospheric volume . alternatively , the radio emission associated with the variable h@xmath0 emission is produced at a much different frequency than our observed 8.5 ghz band",
    ". this may be the result of coherent radio emission from fields weaker than @xmath51 kg , which would lead to emission at @xmath126 hz .    to summarize ,  exhibits quiescent radio emission with no appreciable variability over the timescale of our observation ( 4 rotation periods ) , or on year timescales .",
    "the chromospheric h@xmath0 emission , on the other hand , is highly variable with changes of a factor of 3 in equivalent width on timescales of @xmath127 hr . the h@xmath0 flux exceeds the undetected x - ray emission by at least an order of magnitude , indicating that the chromosphere is not heated by coronal emission .",
    "the radio emission violates the radio / x - ray correlation of f ",
    "m6 stars by about 4 order of magnitude .",
    "[ [ sec : vb ] ]    for  we were able to obtain simultaneous observations only in the x - rays and uv ( figure  [ fig : vb10all ] ) .",
    "the x - ray light curve exhibits both flaring and quiescent emission with ratios of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , quiescent x - ray emission was previously detected from  in a shorter observation @xcite and we confirm its existence here at the same flux level . the x - ray spectrum is dominated by a @xmath130 k plasma , with a possible second component with @xmath131 k ( figure  [ fig : vb10xspec ] ) .",
    "these temperatures are typical of coronal x - ray emission from m dwarfs , and similar to what we previously found for , @xmath132 k ( paper i ) .",
    "the uv emission clearly tracks the x - ray behavior , with detections of the two flares and the quiescent component .",
    "the peak uv brightness exceeds the quiescent emission by a factor of about 5 ( table  [ tab : vb10uvot ] ) , somewhat less that the order of magnitude change in x - ray brightness (  [ sec : xrays ] ) .",
    "moreover , the quiescent component exceeds the expected photospheric emission by about an order of magnitude , and thus points to the existence of a persistent transition region , as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "so far this is the only case of correlated emission found in any of our targets , suggesting that at least some late m dwarfs may follow the behavior seen in early m dwarfs .    as in the case of the x - ray and uv data",
    ", our non - simultaneous optical spectroscopy also reveals a significant level of variability .",
    "as far as we know , our spectroscopic observations provide the most extensive coverage of  in the published literature , and are thus valuable even if no multi - wavelength coverage is available . here",
    "we provide a brief summary of the observations , and defer a detailed analysis to a future publication .",
    "we clearly detect h@xmath0 in emission in all of the individual exposures .",
    "an equivalent width light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : vb10balmer ] .",
    "the range of measured values is @xmath133  , extending to somewhat higher values than previously published for .",
    "similarly , the h@xmath75 line varies from 5 to 26  , while h@xmath134 and h@xmath76 range from undetectable levels ( @xmath135  ) to about 80  .",
    "we also detect h&k emission ranging from non - detectable levels to a k line equivalent width of about 30  .",
    "the emission line light curves exhibit a wide range of variability timescales .",
    "we note that the total duration of our observation samples only about 1/4 of a rotation of  ( @xmath136 km s@xmath9 ) , and we therefore have no information on rotational modulation , which was detected in our previous target ,  ( paper i ) .",
    "the variability is primarily gradual with the rise and fall times of individual episodes being roughly the same .",
    "the broadest brightening has a rise time of about 0.7 hr and a decay time of about 2 hr , with a factor of two increase in equivalent width .",
    "the variability is reflected in all of the detected balmer lines , but the relative change in equivalent width is largest for the weakest lines . this mild change in the balmer decrement points to increased densities and temperatures during brighter emission episodes .",
    "sample spectra in these high and low states are shown in figure  [ fig : vb10spec ] .",
    "in addition to the time - resolved and gradual changes in emission line equivalent width we detect two episodes of rapid brightening with a duration of @xmath78 s ( flare state ) .",
    "these flares are marked by a large increase in the equivalent width of the higher - order balmer lines and the lines relative to the high state spectra .",
    "they are further distinguished from the high state spectra by the appearance of lines ( figure  [ fig : vb10spec ] ) .",
    "temporally , both of the detected flares are superposed on gradual brightenings , suggesting that the two modes of variability are causally and temporally unrelated and arise in different regions of the chromosphere .",
    "the significant difference in balmer decrement between the high and flare states , and the appearance of lines in the latter indicate higher plasma densities , and most likely temperatures in the flare state . a comparison to flares on mid m dwarfs ( @xcite and",
    "references therein ) reveals shallower balmer decrements in the impulsive flares on : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , compared to average values of 0.8 , 0.5 , and 0.4 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the formation of lines generally requires dense plasma ( @xmath140 @xmath109 ) at @xmath141 k , approaching the transition region temperatures .",
    "although our x - ray and optical observations are not simultaneous , the variability timescales in both bands are similar ( figures  [ fig : vb10all ] and [ fig : vb10balmer ] ) .",
    "this suggests that in  chromospheric heating by coronal x - rays may in fact work .",
    "indeed , the observed range of @xmath142 ( table  [ tab : vb10spec ] ) is similar to the range of @xmath143 .",
    "thus , the chromospheric and coronal structure of  is markedly different than that of , for which the h@xmath0 luminosity exceeds the x - ray luminosity by at least an order of magnitude , and no evidence for plasma at coronal temperatures exists .",
    "to conclude , the magnetic activity in  differs significantly from that of  and , and is more typical of m0m6 dwarfs . the x - ray and uv emission",
    "are clearly correlated and point to the presence of quiescent and flaring corona and transition region .",
    "the optical chromospheric emission exhibits similar timescales and amplitudes of variability , and can be separated into a gradually variable component ( low and high states ) , and a rapidly flaring component ( flare state ) that is marked by higher plasma densities and temperatures .",
    "with the increasing sample of ultracool dwarfs observed in the radio and x - rays we can begin to address the physical conditions that underlie the generation of magnetic fields and their influence on the coronae and chromospheres .",
    "it is clear from our work that late m dwarfs exhibit a mix of activity patterns in comparison to stars with spectral types f to early m stars , whose magnetic activity is powered by the @xmath10 dynamo .",
    "thus , it is instructive to investigate whether rotation also plays a role in the magnetic activity of ultracool dwarfs .      the generation of persistent x - ray emission in f ",
    "m stars is still not fully understood , but its correlation with radio activity and rotation velocity suggests that it is directly tied to heating by magnetic field dissipation and particle acceleration . in figure",
    "[ fig : lxrot ] we show the well - known rotation - activity relation and saturation of @xmath144 for stars with spectral type f  m6 .",
    "the rotation - activity relation provides evidence for the existence of an @xmath10 dynamo , while three primary explanations have been proposed for the saturation of @xmath145 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the first is saturation of the dynamo mechanism itself at low rossby numbers , @xmath146 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; here @xmath147 is the convective turnover time .",
    "second , centrifugal effects in rapid rotators may lead to a circulation pattern that sweeps the magnetic fields from the lower convection zone toward the poles , thereby reducing the field filling factor @xcite .",
    "the third explanation is centrifugal stripping of the corona at the corotation radius , @xmath148 @xcite . in this scenario , the particle density , @xmath149 , and emission volume , @xmath150 , conspire to produce an emission measure ( @xmath151 ) that is independent of the rotation period , i.e. , saturation .",
    "however , this balance breaks down when the corotation radius is well inside the corona , @xmath152 , leading to super - saturation  a reduction in @xmath144 at very rapid rotation rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is instructive to study whether the x - ray emission of ultracool dwarfs exhibits saturation and/or super - saturation , and if so , which of the mechanisms described above is responsible for these effects .",
    "the values of @xmath144 as a function of rotation period presented here and in paper i , as well as in the literature , are summarized in figure  [ fig : lxrot ] .",
    "two trends are clear . in the range of rotation periods of @xmath153 d ,",
    "in which f  m6 stars exhibit saturated emission , @xmath154 for the ultracool dwarfs is a few times smaller than the saturated value of the f  m6 stars .",
    "this points to generally weaker coronae in ultracool dwarfs compared to higher mass stars , although in one case an unusually bright flare with @xmath155 was detected @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", ultracool dwarfs with periods of @xmath156 d ( @xmath157 km s@xmath9 ) exhibit much lower values of @xmath158 .",
    "these include our targets  and .",
    "the reduction in x - ray activity at high rotation velocities is reminiscent of the super - saturation phenomenon .    in the context of centrifugal stripping , an ultracool dwarf with @xmath159 m@xmath23 and @xmath160 r@xmath23",
    "has a corotation radius that is smaller than the coronal radius ( @xmath161 above the photosphere ) when @xmath162 hr .",
    "this is a factor of two times smaller than the fastest rotators in the sample , with @xmath163 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that centrifugal stripping may play a role in reducing @xmath144 for fast rotators only if the the magnetic field is generally dominated by extended loops with @xmath164 , which may indeed be the relevant scale for m dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of ,  ( paper i ) , and 2massj00361617 + 1821104 @xcite we inferred from our radio observations a magnetic field scale of @xmath165 cm , in the rough range required for efficient centrifugal stripping .",
    "thus , to the extent that existing observations of ultracool dwarfs reveal possible super - saturation in the x - rays , it is presently unclear whether this is due to intrinsic dynamo effects or to the secondary effect of centrifugal stripping .",
    "the proposed mechanism of centrifugal clearing of the equatorial plane in rapid rotators @xcite is not likely to play a role since the persistent radio emission on @xmath166 timescales in several ultracool dwarfs points to fields with order unity covering fractions .",
    "an alternative possibility for the drop in @xmath144 is that the source of coronal heating is different , and much less efficient , than in higher mass stars .",
    "this scenario may explain the lower values of @xmath144 in the regime where f  m6 stars are saturated .",
    "however , it is unclear why such a scenario should depend on rotation , particularly since the radio emission ( i.e. , particle acceleration ) does not diminish in fast rotators ( see  [ sec : radio ] ) .",
    "we caution that the possibility of super - saturation in the x - rays is based on a small number of objects , and moreover that the effect of centrifugal stripping depends on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "future x - ray observations of additional late m and l dwarfs , as well as the determination of rotation velocities for a larger sample of ultracool dwarfs will reveal whether , and at what rotation velocity , super - saturation may set in present .",
    "if confirmed , the value of @xmath167 at which super - saturation occurs may hold a clue to the nature of the dynamo or the dominant physical scale of coronal magnetic loops .",
    "since radio emission is arguably a more robust tracer of magnetic activity than x - ray emission , we repeat the same exercise for @xmath168 as a function of rotation period and velocity . @xcite noted a possible correlation between radio activity and rotation based on a small sample of ultracool dwarfs , and we re - visit this investigation here . in figure",
    "[ fig : lrrot ] we plot radio detections and upper limits for objects with a known rotation velocity and period .",
    "we find that for objects with spectral type @xmath169 those with @xmath170 km s@xmath9 , or @xmath171 hr , exhibit a typical quiescent radio activity , @xmath172 .",
    "on the other hand , those with @xmath173 km s@xmath9 have @xmath174 , nearly an order of magnitude larger .",
    "if we include objects earlier than m7 , the increase in radio activity with rotation velocity becomes even more pronounced , with a typical level of @xmath175 for @xmath176 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the majority of the ultracool dwarfs with a known rotation velocity remain undetected in vla observations with a typical duration of @xmath177 hr , mostly as a result of the decrease in @xmath178 for l and t dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : lrrot ] and @xcite ) . still , it appears that with the present sample , there is possible evidence for a radio rotation - activity relation , with no evidence for either saturation or super - saturation .",
    "this is contrary to the apparent decrease in @xmath144 at @xmath179 km s@xmath9 (  [ sec : xr ] ) .",
    "if confirmed with future observations , the most likely explanation is that the dynamo mechanism is at least partially driven by rotation ( even in the presence of full convection ) , with no apparent saturation at very low rossby numbers ( @xmath180 ) , contrary to the trend in f  m6 stars .",
    "regardless of the exact dynamo mechanism there is a clear discrepancy between the radio and x - ray observations in terms of a possible activity - rotation relation and its super - saturation .",
    "the lack of clear saturation or super - saturation in the radio indicates that the dynamo itself is not likely to saturate even at high rotation velocities .",
    "the possible decline in x - ray activity at @xmath8 km s@xmath9 may thus be the result of secondary effects such as inefficient heating of the plasma to coronal temperatures , or centrifugal stripping of the most extended magnetic loops , with @xmath181 .",
    "the former scenario is supported by the observed ratio @xmath182 in the quiescent emission from  and , which points to heating of chromospheric plasma by a process other than coronal x - ray emission .",
    "the difference in trends between radio and x - ray activity as a function of rotation velocity may also underlie the violation of the radio / x - ray correlation in ultracool dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : gb ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : bgrot ] we plot @xmath183 relative to its standard value in f",
    " m6 stars ( @xmath184 ; @xcite ) as a function of rotation velocity .",
    "we find that objects with @xmath173 km s@xmath9 exhibit a significantly more severe violation of the radio / x - ray correlation than those with slower rotation .",
    "it is important to note , however , that rotation alone may not fully account for the excess ratios since even objects with @xmath185 km s@xmath9 may exceed the value of @xmath186 by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "still , it appears that faster rotators generally violate the radio / x - ray correlation by a larger factor .",
    "we presented simultaneous multi - wavelength observations of two late m dwarfs to trace the magnetic activity in their outer atmospheres . in the case of  ( m8.5 )",
    "we detect persistent radio emission and highly variable h@xmath0 emission . no excess uv emission is detected .",
    "similarly , we detect no x - ray emission to a deep limit of @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of radio to x - ray flux exceeds the average value measured in a wide range of active stars by more than 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "similarly , the ratio @xmath187 exceeds the values measured for m0m6 dwarfs by at least an order of magnitude , and rules out heating of the quiescent chromosphere by coronal emission .",
    "temporally , we find no correspondence between the radio and h@xmath0 light curves .",
    "this indicates that even if the source of chromospheric heating is magnetic reconnection , it occurs on sufficiently small scales that the overall radio emission does not change by more than @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively , the radio emission produced in conjunction with the h@xmath0 variability may peak at a lower frequency than our 8.5 ghz observations .",
    "in the former scenario , our limit on the radio variability during the brightest h@xmath0 episode can be interpreted as a limit of @xmath6 on the chromospheric volume involved in the variable h@xmath0 emission . in the latter scenario ,",
    "it is possible that the coincident radio emission is dominated by coherent emission at @xmath188 , with @xmath189 kg .    with our measured rotation velocity of @xmath190 km s@xmath9 for , the radio observations sample nearly 4 full rotations .",
    "the stability of the radio emission thus requires a large - scale and uniform magnetic field , with an inferred strength of @xmath5 g. the similarity in flux to a past observation suggests that the field is stable on year timescales .",
    "this may be expected given the long convective turnover time for ultracool dwarfs , on the order of several years .",
    ", on the other hand , exhibits bright and variable x - ray and uv emission , including a pair of flares and quiescent emission . the behavior in both bands , which trace the corona and transition region , respectively , is highly correlated . from the x - ray spectrum",
    "we infer a coronal temperature of about @xmath191 k , with a possible second component at @xmath192 k. the optical emission lines exhibit a similar amplitude and timescale of variability to the x - rays and uv , with two distinct states of gradual and impulsive flaring . the lack of causal relation between the two states points to emission from distinct plasma environments . moreover ,",
    "the shallow balmer decrement and emission in the impulsive flare state require significantly denser and hotter plasma .",
    "our detailed study of , , and  reveals mixed patterns of of behavior compared to the magnetic activity in f - m6 stars , and thus points to a transition in the atmospheric structure and heating process in the late m dwarf regime .",
    "in particular , stellar - scale magnetic fields are present , as evidence by quiescent and uniform radio emission , but the coronae are generally weaker than in early m dwarfs .",
    "the chromospheric activity declines less rapidly , and all three targets exhibit a similar range of highly variable h@xmath0 emission , @xmath193 .",
    "this range is about an order of magnitude less that the saturated value of mid m dwarfs .    in the standard picture of solar and stellar magnetic flares , the release of magnetic energy through processes such as reconnection leads to acceleration of electrons , and subsequently heating of the chromosphere , transition region , and corona through evaporation of the lower atmosphere . in quiescence ,",
    "the chromospheres of m0m6 dwarfs may instead be heated by coronal x - ray emission @xcite , as evidenced by the typical observed ratios of @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism is clearly not at play in the case of , and most likely , since the chromospheric emission is significantly more energetic than the non - detected corona .",
    "it is possible instead that the source of chromospheric heating is continuous micro - flaring activity , leading to replenishment of chromospheric and transition region plasma by evaporation . in this scenario",
    "the weak or absent coronal emission may be due to a limited temperature enhancement of @xmath195 k , which is sufficient to produce chromospheric emission , but no significant soft x - ray emission .",
    "the continuously variable h@xmath0 emission in appears to support this idea , and along with the lack of corresponding radio variability points to heating on scales much smaller than the stellar photosphere .    as we noted in ",
    "[ sec : rot ] , it is also possible that rapid rotation in ultracool dwarfs suppresses the x - ray emission through centrifugal stripping . the apparent increase in radio activity with rotation indicates that the dynamo itself does not saturate , at least up to @xmath196 km s@xmath9 , which is roughly @xmath197 of the break - up velocity .",
    "the effects leading to the apparent super - saturation in the x - rays may also underlie the severe violation of the radio / x - ray correlation since the level of violation appears to be correlated with rotation velocity ( figure  [ fig : bgrot ] ) .",
    "we stress that the role of rotation is still speculative due to the small number of objects with x - ray , radio , and rotation measurements .",
    "it is therefore crucial to increase the sample of ultracool dwarfs for which these quantities are measured .    to summarize ,",
    "we conclude that late m dwarfs mark a change in the properties of the magnetic field and its dissipation , as well as the generation of high temperature plasma in the outer atmosphere .",
    "the weak x - ray emission , both in relation to @xmath178 and @xmath198 , points to inefficient heating of plasma to coronal temperatures , or alternatively to stripping of the most extended magnetic loops .",
    "the lack of temporal correlation between the radio and h@xmath0 activity , however , indicates that even if atmospheric evaporation is taking place , it occurs on smaller physical scale than the overall magnetic field structure .",
    "we end by noting that the use of simultaneous , multi - wavelength , and long duration observations to probe the magnetic activity of individual ultracool dwarfs provides a crucial complement to large single - band surveys .",
    "in particular , the long duration and high time resolution data elucidate the range of timescales and amplitudes of gradual and impulsive flares , and can moreover uncover rotationally - induced modulations , as in the case of  ( paper i ) .",
    "in addition , the existence or absence of correlations between the various activity indicators ( as in  and ) , and their implications for the magnetic field and its dissipation , could not have been inferred from existing observations . in the upcoming chandra cycle",
    "we will expand our analysis with observations of several l0l3 dwarfs .",
