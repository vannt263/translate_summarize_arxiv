    "due to the increased video traffic , efficient video - aware transmission schemes are of highest importance  @xcite .",
    "in particular , video throughput of wireless networks can be enhanced by device - to - device ( d2d ) communications  @xcite .",
    "d2d video transmission needs to deal with two aspects : ( i ) link scheduling and ( ii ) adaptive video quality in streaming .",
    "traditionally these aspects have been treated separately . in this paper",
    "we propose and analyze algorithms that take the interrelationship between those tasks into account .    for _ centralized _ scheduling , the scheduling decisions can be made by a base station , assuming it knows the channel states for all the possible d2d pairs .",
    "we can formulate the scheduling problem as a max - weight independent set ( mwis ) problem which we solve ( approximately ) using a well - established message - passing algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the weights for the mwis problem arise from the streaming ( quality control ) part .",
    "currently , the most well - known _ distributed _ d2d scheduler is _ flashlinq _  @xcite .",
    "however , flashlinq does not incorporate naturally a video - quality - aware mechanism , and therefore its suitability for d2d video streaming remains open .",
    "we propose an improvement by incorporating weights .",
    "our _ streaming _ algorithm dynamically controls the quality mode of each chunk to maximize the total quality subject to all data being supportable .",
    "it does so via a stochastic formulation that can trade off queue stability with delay .",
    "obviously , higher video quality requires transmission of more bits , which increases the probability of playback stalls .",
    "the tradeoff between video quality and stall probability is a key measure for any transmission scheme , and we use it to assess the performance of the algorithms in this paper .",
    "our simulations show that algorithms that exploit the interconnection between scheduling and streaming provide a significantly better performance , i.e. , better tradeoff between stall probability and video quality .",
    "each d2d tx has a queue whose length evolves as : @xmath0 + \\lambda_{i}(t ) , l_{i}\\in\\mathcal{l } \\label{eq : q}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 stand for the queue backlog size at the tx of the @xmath4-th d2d link @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , the number of bits leaving the queue of the tx of @xmath5 , and the number of bits added to the queue of the tx of @xmath5 ( associated with the placement of chunks ) , respectively .",
    "suppose that a chunk ( the basic transmission unit , about 0.5 sec . of video )",
    "contains @xmath7 pixels and each chunk of each file @xmath8 is encoded at a number of different quality modes @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the video quality measure ( e.g. , peak - signal - to - noise - ratio ( psnr ) ) and the number of bits for @xmath8 at chunk time @xmath12 with @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "a network controller chooses @xmath14 for each @xmath12 for all requesting rxs @xmath4 , allocates the source coding rate @xmath15 .",
    "the tx of @xmath5 places the @xmath16 bits in its tx queue @xmath17 .",
    "* centralized scheduling with mwis formulation : * the scheduling is based on a link conflict graph such that the links scheduled to be active simultaneously in any time slot must form an independent set . in the conflict graph where the d2d links constitute the nodes , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the set of d2d links .",
    "thus , edge in the conflict graph between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is denoted as @xmath22 , and @xmath23 if @xmath20 interferes with @xmath21 ; otherwise , @xmath24 .",
    "now , the objective is to find the set of links that can maximize the sum of the weights @xmath25 of each @xmath5 .",
    "this problem is a mwis , and can be mathematically expressed as : maximizing @xmath26 subject to @xmath27 , if @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a boolean index of @xmath5 which is @xmath30 if @xmath5 is scheduled ( otherwise , @xmath31 ) . in our case ,",
    "the weights are updated at each @xmath6 , such that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 indicates the rate supported by link @xmath34 at @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that such max - weight policy achieves strong stability of the transmission queues , whenever the arrival rates are stabilizable , i.e. , they fall inside the ergodic achievable rate region of the system  @xcite .",
    "the exact value of @xmath33 of d2d link @xmath5 can not be obtained before a scheduling decision is made because the interference is unknown . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "@xmath33 can be approximated as follows  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the tx power from @xmath37 intended for @xmath38 at @xmath6 , @xmath39 is the ( complex amplitude ) channel gain from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , @xmath40 is the standard deviation of the ( gaussian ) background noise , @xmath41 is the interference thresholds , i.e. , the maximum admissible interference @xmath41 from a single interferer scheduled at the same time . for solving mwis problem , various approximation algorithms have been proposed because mwis is np - hard . among them , we use well - established _ message - passing _ that shows an excellent tradeoff between performance and complexity  @xcite .",
    "* distributed max - weight scheduling : * in flashlinq , lower - priority d2d links can transmit only if they do not create significant interference to the higher - priority d2d links  @xcite . with the concept of max - weight scheduling",
    ", we set the priorities of d2d links as @xmath42 which let each link wait @xmath43 before transmission .",
    ".expected num . of stalls ( @xmath44 , @xmath45db ) [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      * arrival process ( placement of chunks ) : * in each chunk time @xmath46 , the tx of every link should place chunks within its queue .",
    "different quality modes are available in each chunk , where a higher mode requires more bits .",
    "we aim to maximize the total quality over all scheduled links subject to stability of the scheduled tx queues .",
    "let @xmath47 .",
    "then the following formulation is our objective function where ( [ eq : meanratestable ] ) means all queues should fulfill rate stability  @xcite : @xmath48\\\\ \\text{subject to } & & \\lim_{\\tau\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\sum_{t=0}^{\\tau-1}\\nolimits \\mathbb{e}\\left[q_{i}(t)\\right ] < \\infty , \\forall l_{i } \\in\\mathcal{l}.\\label{eq : meanratestable}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , the quality control involves choosing @xmath49 , the quality mode at chunk time @xmath6 ; as follows  @xcite : @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{eq : final2 } \\ ] ]    thus , @xmath3 can be @xmath51 ( if @xmath52 , otherwise , @xmath53 ) when the optimal @xmath13 is determined @xmath54 .    *",
    "departure process ( tx of bits ) : * according to shannon s capacity equation , @xmath2 can be computed as : @xmath55   \\label{eq : dept } $ ] where @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the set of simultaneously scheduled links , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the power transmitted by @xmath60 intended for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the channel gain from the tx of @xmath20 to the rx of @xmath5 at @xmath6 , @xmath63 is a bandwidth .",
    "depending on the distribution of used chunk sizes , the time scale of departure process is set independent to the time scale of arrival process .",
    "in our simulations , we used 2-hour 4 video traces with realistic d2d layout and pathloss models  @xcite .",
    "our proposed centralized and distributed algorithms are denoted as mpmwis - qp and flashlinq - qp .",
    "they are compared with the flashlinq variant which controls the quality as in [ sec : streaming ] , but the scheduling is randomized ( named flashlinq - q ) .    *",
    "pre - buffering time ( pbt ) : * table  [ tbl - prebuffering2 ] shows results when the pbt is from 7 to 10 ( unit : sec ) .",
    "we can see that mpmwis - qp and flashlinq - qp present no stalls when pbts=8 and pbt=9 , i.e. , mpmwis - qp shows the best performance .",
    "but , flashlinq - q has stalls even if pbt=10 .        *",
    "average quality vs. num . of stalls : * changing @xmath64 allows to trade off quality with the number of stalls . for a given acceptable number of stalls , fig .",
    "[ fig : stall2 ] shows mpmwis - qp provides the highest psnr ; and the performance of flashlinq - qp is around @xmath65 db lower than the one of mpmwis - qp ; flashlinq - q shows around @xmath66 db lower psnr .",
    "this paper proposed centralized quality - aware adaptive streaming and scheduling algorithms which can be used for d2d video delivery applications .",
    "for basestation - aided centralized scheduling , a message - passing algorithm is used to obtain the solutions of the mwis link scheduling problem .. for distributed scheduling , we improved a flashlinq scheduler with the principle of max - weight scheduling . for streaming ,",
