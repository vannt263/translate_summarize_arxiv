    "the quark phenomenology is based on the hypothesis of the quasinuclear hadron structure : the hadron consists of two ( meson ) or three ( baryon ) spatially separated dressed quarks like the nucleus consists of nucleons .",
    "a dressed quark of the quasinuclear model should be a quark - gluon cluster consisting of the valence quark , sea quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the small size of the dressed quark may be connected with the small range of gluon interaction .",
    "one should try to describe soft processes operating with dressed quarks as quasi - particles .",
    "the project is devoted to the construction of low - energy quark scattering amplitudes .",
    "the iteration bootstrap procedure includes two types of point - like input interactions , namely the four - fermion interaction with quantum numbers of the gluon and four - fermion interaction induced by instantons ( the exchange of white states with @xmath4 ) .",
    "calculations performed in the framework of this model argue in favor of the quasinuclear quark structure of hadrons .",
    "the resulting quark interaction appeared to be effectively short - range .",
    "this interaction is determined mainly by the exchange in the gluon channel : the calculated constituent gluon mass @xmath5 to be not small .",
    "the creation of mesons ( pion included ) is mainly due to the gluon exchange .",
    "the mass values of the lowest mesons ( @xmath6 ) and their quark content are obtained . in the color channel",
    "@xmath7 the bound states of the scalar diquarks with the masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 are obtained .",
    "the dispersion relation technique allows us to calculate the form factors of light mesons using quark amplitudes in corresponding channels .",
    "the calculated values of the charge radii squared of pion and kaon are in good agreement with data .",
    "the calculated values of the charge radii squared of u , d , s quarks are equal :  @xmath10 .",
    "the charge radii of non - strange and strange scalar diquarks are calculated : @xmath11 ,  @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 .",
    "+ in this consideration one has neglected the forces of confinement .",
    "this is due to the fact that the model is actually based on the assumption that the confinement radius is much larger than the radius of dressed quarks , and also larger than the radius of the forces responsible for the existence of the low - lying hadrons . in the case of the orbital excited mesons : p- ,  d- ,  f - wave mesons one can not neglect the confinement potential . therefore the main idea is the modification of precise theory by help of changing the interaction of quarks and anti - quarks at large range and do not charge the interaction at small range .",
    "therefore one constructs the approximate model , in which there are free quarks , but the theory of quark - anti - quark scattering uses only the necessary part of the confinement potential .",
    "this idea can be used in different approach . in our case",
    "the confinement potential is imitated by the simple increasing of constituent quark masses .",
    "it allows us to construct the p- ,  d- ,  f - wave meson amplitudes and calculate the mass spectrum , which is in good agreement with data .",
    "we calculate the behavior of meson regge trajectories for the low - energy region , which is based on the principles of multi - color qcd . in the framework of an approach developed previously for light quarks",
    "one calculates the scattering amplitudes of heavy quarks @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( q = u ,  d ,  s ; q = c ,  b ) .",
    "the interaction of heavy quarks is described by forces corresponding of exchange of light white and colored mesons .",
    "the main role in the formation of the spectrum of heavy mesons is played by the forces that correspond to exchange of a massive gluon .",
    "it is necessary to take into account the renormalization of the quark amplitudes for light quarks , which is determined by the rescattering of the heavy quarks .",
    "we obtained the masses of lowest multiplets of c- and b - mesons with quantum numbers @xmath16 .",
    "+ then we use a quark interaction potential , which is obtained from the nonrelativistic limit of relativistic quark amplitudes of the bootstrap quark model .",
    "but the quark amplitudes obtained in the bootstrap procedure depend not only on the square t of the momentum transfer , but also on the energy variable @xmath17 . therefore , a literal transition to nonrelativistic potentials is not possible : these amplitudes rather correspond to quasipotentials .",
    "if the energy @xmath18 is fixed , and already at fixed energy the dependence on the momentum transfer is considered to be a potential nature .",
    "+ we investigated s - wave baryons with quantum numbers @xmath19 consisting of u and d quarks . the masses and wave function of the baryons",
    "were obtained from the solution of the nonrelativistic faddeev equations for the three - quark system with the diquark potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "one obtained the electric and magnetic form factors of the nucleons .",
    "the values of the masses of the nucleons and the @xmath22 isobar agree well with the experimental values , then we have a good agreement with experiment for the magnetic moments @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the charge radius of the proton has been to be almost a factor of two smaller than experimental value @xmath25 , charge radius of the neutron has been found to be zero .",
    "this calculation has not new parameters besides the bootstrap quark model results .",
    "the behavior of additional linear potential are investigated and do not essentially change the results . in our paper a relativistically generalization of the three - body faddeev equations was obtained in the form of dispersion relations in the pair energy of two interacting particles .",
    "the mass spectrum of s - wave baryons @xmath26 including u ,  d ,  s quarks was calculated by a method based on isolating of the leading singularities in the amplitude .",
    "we searched for the approximate solution of integral three - quark equations by taking into account two - particle and triangle singularities , all the weaker ones being neglected .",
    "if we considered the approximation , which corresponds to taking into account two - body and triangle singularities , and define all the smooth functions of the sub - energy variables ( as compared with the singular part of the amplitude ) in the middle point of physical region of dalitz - plot , then the problem reduces to one of solving simple algebraic system equations .",
    "the masses of the baryons of the two lowest multiplets with @xmath27 and @xmath28 are calculated and found to be in a good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the behavior of the electromagnetic form factors of nucleons and hyperons in the region of low and intermediate momentum transfers @xmath29 is determined . the calculated value ( without new parameters ) of the charge radius of the proton",
    "was found to be @xmath30 , hyperons @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the charge radius of the neutron , and other noncharge hyperons were found to be practically equal to zero . in the framework of dispersion relation technique the relativistic faddeev equations for charmed baryons",
    "are found .",
    "the approximate solutions of the relativistic three - particle problem based on the extraction of leading singularities of amplitudes are obtained .",
    "the mass values of lowest charmed baryon multiplets @xmath26 are calculated .",
    "the behavior of electromagnetic form factors of charmed baryons ( @xmath27 ) in the region of low and intermediate momentum transfers @xmath29 is determined . the calculated value ( without new parameters ) of the charge radii baryons like @xmath34 , @xmath35 and so on @xmath36 .",
    "the charge radii of noncharge charmed baryons are equal to zero .",
    "we calculated the multiplets masses of radial excited baryon , included the roper resonance , with quantum number @xmath26 at @xmath37 .",
    "the problem of confinement is solved analogous to the case of excited mesons .",
    "finally , a practical treatment of relativistic two- and three - hadron quark systems have been developed .",
    "the theory is based on the three principles of unitarity , analiticity and crossing symmetry .",
    "these principles are applied to the two - body subenergy channels .",
    "the scattering quark amplitudes allow to calculate the spectrum and electromagnetic properties of hadrons . in soft processes , where small momentum transfers are essential , the perturbative qcd technique is not applicable . in this case",
    "the way of phenomenology should include quark model results as well .",
    "quark models make it possible to describe the qualitative properties of qcd in the nonperturbative region . in the framework of quark models important information",
    "is obtained on the properties of light mesons  @xcite-  @xcite and baryons  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the successful use of quark potential models is connected with a successful choice of the effective parameters : the mass of the dressed quarks , the characteristics of the confinement potential , and the coupling constant @xmath38 . in quark models , which describe rather well the masses and static properties of light hadrons ,",
    "the masses of the quarks usually have the same values for both mesons and baryons .",
    "however , this is achieved at the expense of some difference in the characteristic of the confinement potential .",
    "it should be borne in mind that for a fixed hadron mass the masses of dressed quarks which enter into the composition of the hadron will become smaller when the slope of the confinement potential increases or its radius decreases .",
    "+ therefore , conversely one can change the masses of the dressed quarks when going from the spectrum of s - wave mesons to s - wave baryons , while keeping the characteristic of the confinement potential unchanged .",
    "the mass spectrum of charmed and beauty mesons is subject of investigation of many theoretical papers , based on various approaches .",
    "calculation in potential models are widespread  @xcite-  @xcite . + the unquestionable advantage of the potential approach to the description of heavy mesons is its simplicity and transparency .",
    "it makes it possible to calculate ( in the framework of the adopted model of the potential ) the positions of the levels , the widths of radiative transitions between levels , and the widths of annihilation decays .",
    "thus , in fact it succeeds in determining of behavior of the wave function of the system in a fairly wide range of distances , which is very important for an understanding of the dynamics of the interaction of the quarks .",
    "a serious difficulty of the potential approach is the fact that it can not be fully substantiated in the framework of qcd .",
    "the method of qcd sum rules has been successfully and to determine the masses of the light and heavy mesons  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the vacuum condensates are considered as phenomenological parameters determined from the experimental data or from self - consistency of the sum rules .",
    "the most serious difficulty for the application of the sum - rule method to bottomonium ( for instance ) is the problem of taking into account relativistic corrections .",
    "so far there has been no such calculation .",
    "the project is devoted to the construction of low - energy quark scattering amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes of dressed quarks are calculated in the framework of the dispersion technique with the help of the iteration bootstrap procedure .",
    "the theory is based on three principles of unitarity , analyticity and crossing symmetry which are applied to the three - body sub - energy channels .",
    "+ the iteration bootstrap procedure for quark - quark and quark - anti - quark amplitudes was made with the four - fermion interaction as an input : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the point - like structure of this interaction is motivated by the idea of the two characteristic sizes in the hadron . on the other hand ,",
    "the applicability of  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is verified by the success of the de - rujula - georgi - glashow quark model  @xcite , where only the short - range part of the breit potential connected with the gluon exchange is responsible for the mass splitting in hadron multiplets . however , the correct description of low - lying meson masses is impossible using the effective gluon exchange interaction  ( [ eq:1 ] ) only .",
    "the large value of the @xmath41 mass splitting and the small pion values indicate the existence of an additional interaction .",
    "such an additional four - fermion interaction can be induced by instantons .",
    "this interaction should also be a short - range one because of the small radius of the effective gluon interaction .",
    "we have included this type of interaction in the iteration bootstrap calculation .",
    "the scheme of the iteration bootstrap procedure suggested in this paper is as follows .",
    "the partial amplitudes are calculated through the dispersion technique .",
    "+ the zero approximation in fig .",
    "1d is drawn as the sum of diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1a ,  b ,  c etc .",
    "the amplitude of the first approximation ( fig .",
    "1h ) is obtained when the zero approximation amplitude is taken as an interaction like eq.([eq:1 ] ) , i.e. the interaction in the first approximation is determined by the exchange diagrams of the zero approximation .",

    "as was stated above , this interaction is determined mainly by the exchange in the gluon channel : the constituent - gluon mass appeared to be not small .",
    "moreover , calculations reveal an additional reason for the short - rangeness of the interaction , connected with certain specific features of the quark - quark interaction . the value of the constituent gluon mass obtained in this model ( 700 mev ) seems to be rather reasonable : just this mass value is required by hadron phenomenology",

    "it is obvious that the interaction forces which determine the baryon spectrum are in fact the same as for diquarks in the bootstrap quark model for s - wave mesons . on account of the rules of the @xmath2-expansion the diquark forces",
