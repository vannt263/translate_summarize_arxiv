    "with the second , 14 tev , phase of the lhc experiments approaching , the need for the precision qcd parton shower increases . to date there are successful approaches of merging nlo hard process and lo cascade like mc@nlo @xcite or powheg @xcite .",
    "other attempts are also taken to improve precision of parton showers @xcite .",
    "however , in order to construct qcd parton shower that includes nnlo hard process , it will be mandatory to construct a cascade at the nlo level .",
    "such a cascade is developed within the krkmc project  @xcite .",
    "one of the crucial elements of this project is the recalculation and reorganization of the nlo splitting functions .",
    "the real emission part of the non - singlet ( ns ) splitting function has been discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "the virtual @xmath0 ns components have been briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on the remaining ns virtual corrections .",
    "we will also give an update on the development of the mathematica package ` axiloop`@xcite , that is written to assist with the nlo calculations in the light - cone gauge .    before going into details let us comment on the real corrections .",
    "let us consider a graph shown in fig .",
    "[ gr_d ] .     contributing to the nlo non - singlet splitting function.,height=94 ]    this interference graph contributes to the ns splitting function and is labelled @xmath1 . by comparing the results for this graph from @xcite with the previous ones of @xcite we note that they differ .",
    "the singular part of the graph `` @xmath2 '' in @xcite reads ( table 3.10 p.   99 ) @xmath3 and contains single and double poles in @xmath4 ( the first line ) and pure spurious poles ( the second line ) ; where @xmath5 is the lo quark - quark splitting function , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the infrared divergent functions regulated with @xmath8 , cf .",
    "( [ plus ] ) , and dimension of the phase space is defined as @xmath9 . in @xcite for the same contribution we find only pure spurious pole terms ( eq .  3.48 ) : @xmath10 note , that those are semi - inclusive results which means that additional integration over one real momentum is left to be calculated .",
    "it is of the generic form @xmath11 .",
    "such an integration introduces additional pole in @xmath4 , so the inclusive form of eq .",
    "( [ d_hei ] ) contains @xmath12 pole , whereas inclusive form of eq .",
    "( [ d_stj ] ) contains just @xmath13 terms .",
    "pole one finds @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lower limit of the integral @xmath16 , see eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) of @xcite . ] .",
    "summarizing , the result ( [ d_hei ] ) contains higher order poles in @xmath17 , absent in the new result in eq .",
    "( [ d_stj ] ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , absence of higher order poles is important for the construction of the stochastic cascade , which must be done in four dimensions .",
    "some clarifications are in order here : ( i ) in the standard , inclusive , approach one adds real and virtual corrections and , as can be seen in @xcite , the higher order poles cancel out .",
    "however , from the monte carlo point of view real - virtual cancellations pose additional complications .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath18 pole _ does not _ disappear in new approach of @xcite  the singularity is simply regulated differently , as @xmath19 etc .",
    ", see below .",
    "( iii ) due to the presence of higher order poles , the `` trivial '' terms , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc .",
    ", cancel between real and virtual corrections in @xcite and are absent in @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the complete nlo ns kernel , which is a coefficient of the single pole is also affected by the changes in higher order pole terms , however , it must be independent of the choice of the regularization",
    ". therefore we expect that the difference between results ( [ d_hei ] ) and ( [ d_stj ] ) will be compensated by an appropriate change in the virtual contributions .",
    "let us now discuss the mechanism responsible for this difference .",
    "besides the fact that lorentz structure of feynman rules in the light - cone gauge is more complicated than in the covariant gauges , additional difficulties arise due to the specific structure of the axial denominator , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the axial vector .",
    "it leads to the spurious ( non - physical ) singularities when integrated over virtual or real phase space .",
    "therefore one must apply some prescription to regularize them in the intermediate steps .",
    "the common choice is a principal value ( pv ) prescription @xcite .",
    "it was originally used in @xcite in the first calculation of the nlo splitting functions from the feynman diagrams .",
    "the other option is the mandelstam - leibbrandt prescription @xcite .",
    "it is better founded in the qft , but significantly more complicated in practical calculations .",
    "further analysis and comparison of these prescriptions can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the idea of the pv regularization is to replace @xmath22 terms by @xmath25_{pv }            = \\frac{l_+}{l_+^2 + { \\delta}^2p_+^2 } , \\label{plus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is an infinitesimal regulator , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is some reference momentum .",
    "this prescription has to be applied to the axial propagators of the gluons @xcite at the level of feynman rules , i.e.  at the very beginning of the calculation , and it leads to the results like ( [ d_hei ] ) .",
    "closer inspection of the derivations in @xcite reveals , that there are , however , also different sources of the @xmath22 terms , related to the phase space evaluation , change of variables etc . in the standard pv prescription",
    "these terms are _ not _ regularized by @xmath8 , dimensional regularization takes care of them . on the contrary , we propose , that _ all _ these singularities in plus variable _ are _ regulated also by the pv prescription . in practice",
    "we replace @xmath28_{pv } l_+^{\\epsilon } \\label{plusbar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in _ all _ the places , keeping track of the higher order @xmath17 terms , if needed .",
    "contrary to the previous case , this has to be done at the very end of the integrations . on the technical level it means that the usual ( pv ) approach : ( i ) use some parametrization technique ( like feynman or schwinger parametrization ) to combine denominators ;",
    "( ii ) perform momentum integration ; ( iii ) perform integration over the feynman / schwinger parameters ; is not suitable .",
    "instead one needs to perform integration over @xmath29 at the very end , after the integration over @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 variables : @xmath33 for explicit formulae arranged in this way , see for example @xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "now also the non - axial integrals , initially free of axial vector @xmath24 ( which defines the plus component , @xmath34 ) , can develop dependence on the vector @xmath24 .",
    "for example , let us show the three - point integral without axial denominator @xmath35 for the special kinematic configuration : @xmath36 .",
    "standard approach leads to the following expression : @xmath37 in contrast our prescription gives the result : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the axial - vector - dependent parameter .",
    "as one can see , eq .",
    "is free of double poles in @xmath4 .",
    "note that this singularity did not disappear , but has been replaced by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "more details will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us now use the new prescription in the actual calculation .",
    "we present here results for one of the virtual graphs contributing to the non - singlet splitting function , namely graph `` @xmath2 '' , i.e.  the second graph in fig.[fig : ns - set ] .",
    "( c)1.4 cm ( d ) ( e)1.6 cm ( f)1.6 cm ( g )    the presented results have been obtained with the help of the mathematica package ` axiloop ` , which we developed to assist with the calculations in the light - cone gauge .",
    "overview of the ` axiloop`package is provided in the appendix .    in table",
    "[ tb : ff ] we show inclusive contributions separately for the real graph `` ( d ) '' ( fig .  [ gr_d ] ) taken from eq .",

    "let us describe these results in more detail .",
    "first of all , the last column in table [ tb : ff ] is in full agreement with the result of table 1 of @xcite , where only the sum of real and virtual contributions is given .",
    "the virtual contribution alone can be obtained from @xcite in the standard pv prescription .",
    "the second point is that @xmath82 pole is absent in the inclusive virtual contribution , in a similar manner as it disappeared from the inclusive real contribution , see discussion of eq .  .",
    "results obtained by applying the pv prescription ( see eq",
    ".   for the real graph ) do not have this property .",
    "thirdly , neither real nor virtual contribution depends on the scale @xmath83 of the hard process .",
    "this is not true for the standard prescription  in that case only the sum of real and virtual terms is independent of @xmath83 .",
    "the same happens also for the `` trivial '' terms , like @xmath21 or @xmath84 .",
    "note however , that there are some contributions for which this property does not hold .",
    "in this note we presented some details of the recalculation of virtual graphs contributing to the nlo ns splitting function , necessary for the construction of the monte carlo cascade at the nlo level .",
    "we argued , that in order to be compatible with the earlier calculation @xcite for the real components , the pv prescription must be used in a modified way . as a result , at the inclusive level",
    ", the @xmath12 poles are replaced by the structures like @xmath85 and no cancellations of @xmath12 poles between real and virtual parts is needed .",
    "we performed calculations for the case of the ns splitting function and presented them here on the example of one diagram .",
    "as expected , our results for real and virtual contributions differ from the ones in pv prescription , but the sum of real and virtual contributions is the same . to the `` physical '' collinear factorization scheme is also underlined in the recent paper  @xcite . ] . in the next step",
    "we plan to apply the new prescription to the singlet virtual graphs . in order to automatize the calculations in the light - cone gauge we developed a mathematica package ` axiloop`with the help of which a set of one - loop graphs contributing to the ns splitting functions at next - to - leading order can be calculated in the standard and modified pv prescriptions . in the future",
    "the package can be extended to calculate singlet one - real - one - virtual as well as two - loop and two - real corrections to the splitting functions .",
    "this work is partly supported by the polish national science center grant dec-2011/03/b / st2/02632 , the research executive agency ( rea ) of the european union grant pitn - ga-2010 - 264564 ( lhcphenonet ) , the u.s .",
    "department of energy under grant de - fg02 - 13er41996 and the lightner - sams foundation .",
    "two of the authors ( s.j . and m.s )",
    "are grateful for the the warm hospitality of the th unit of the cern ph division , while completing this work .",
    "for calculating virtual corrections to the nlo splitting functions we built a software package for the wolfram mathematica system  ` axiloop`@xcite . in this section , we describe a general structure as well as some core features of the package implemented up to date .    `",
    "axiloop`is an open - source , general - purpose package which provides a complete set of routines for calculating feynman - diagram - based objects in light - cone gauge in analytical form . in the current version a full set of the virtual diagrams contributing to the non - singlet nlo splitting functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ns - set ] ) is calculated using a new regularization prescription .",
    "functions provided by ` axiloop`may be divided into the two main groups : a set of general - purpose _ core routines _ , which likely can be used in other packages for solving general - purpose problems and _ custom routines _ dedicated to calculation of the splitting functions .    _ core routines _ perform the following tasks : trace and vector algebra operations in arbitrary number of dimensions  @xcite ; virtual integrals in light - cone and feynman gauges with custom regularization schemes ( including the one discussed in this paper ) ; various simplification algorithms for loop integrals ( e.g.  @xcite ) ; reduction of tensor integrals using passarino - veltman approach @xcite ; final - state integration .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that ` axiloop`provides a flexible implementation of the loop integration routines which can be modified and extended for various contexts .",
    "one of the core routines is ` integrateloop ` function which performs one - loop integration in @xmath86 dimensions .",
    "it handles feynman and axial two- and three - point integrals with up to a rank 3 tensor structures in the numerator . as a demonstration",
    "we show the scalar integral of eq .  ,",
    "which in ` axiloop`notation looks as follows :      in general , we distinguish infra - red and ultra - violet singularities when dimensional regularization prescription is used .",
    "the infrared origin of the pole is indicated by the ` eir ` symbol .",
    "ultra - violet poles , which appear in two- and some three - point integrals , are represented by poles in the ` euv ` symbol .",
    "_ custom routines _ in our case are dedicated to the calculation of the nlo virtual splitting functions .",
    "they produce analytical expressions for the components of the splitting functions at different stages of the calculation , as defined in @xcite : ( i )  renormalized and bare exclusive formulas , which are usually omitted by other authors  they play a key role in the construction of the parton shower monte carlo ; ( ii )  inclusive results for cross - checking with previous known results ; and ( iii )  ultra - violet counter - terms .",
    "the main routine for calculating splitting functions is ` splittingfunction ` . as its input a complete description of the calculated graph in terms of the feynman rules should be provided .",
    "the following example demonstrates invocation of ` splittingfunction ` for calculating virtual contribution of the topology `` ( d ) '' :    .... in[3]:= splittingfunction [ g[n]/(4 p.n ) fp[k ] fv[i1 ] fp[l ] fv[i2 ]    gp[i1,i3 , l+k ] gp[i2,i4 , l+p ] gv[i3,-l - k , i4,l+p , mu ,-",
    "p+k ]    fpx[p ] gpx[mu , nu , p - k ] fv[nu ] fp[k ]    ,    integrateloopprescription - > \" mpv \" ] ....    the ` integrateloopprescription ` option allows one to change regularization prescription for loop integrals .",
    "it accepts ` pv ` and ` mpv ` values for the pv prescription or its modification ( described in this work ) respectively .",
    "remaining routines , i.e. ` fp ` ( ` fpx ` ) , ` gp ` ( ` gpx ` ) , ` fv ` , and ` gv ` , correspond to the feynman rules and read as fermion / gluon propagator ( suffix ` x ` indicates that corresponding propagator is cut ) and fermion / gluon vertex respectively .    at the moment in the ` axiloop`package we have implemented all the ns one - real - one - virtual corrections ( corresponding graphs are depicted in the fig .  [",
    "fig : ns - set ] ) and the library of two- and three - point integrals in the light - cone gauge for both regularization schemes .",
