    "suppose we associate to the edges of a complete graph on @xmath7 vertices costs drawn independently from a uniform [ 0 , 1 ] distribution .",

    "once we have inspected the cost of an edge , we must decide whether we want to pay the price of that edge and purchase it or reject it forever .",
    "if we must buy a certain number of subgraphs lying in a given set of target structures , what is the minimum expected cost paid over all strategies ? observe that the case where the set of target structures @xmath4 is a subset of the edges of the graph and we want to purchase a single edge from @xmath4 is closely related to the well - studied secretary problem ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) , it is attributed to cayley @xcite by ferguson @xcite and solved by moser @xcite .    frieze and pegden @xcite studied this problem for various target structures such as matchings , spanning trees and paths between two given vertices .",

    "they have showed that the minimum expected cost of purchasing a triangle in the pom and rom settings ( defined later ) are @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . from those two bounds they generalised only the bound for the minimum expected cost in the rom setting by showing that the cost a purchasing a @xmath10 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "they left the analysis of the cost of purchasing any other subgraph as an open question .    unquestionably , the order in which the @xmath6 are examined changes some aspects of the problem and presumably it should affect the expected price paid for a structure . in this paper we will consider the following two models . +",

    "+ * randomly ordered online model - rom : * in this model , the order in which we inspect the items is determined by a permutation @xmath15 that is chosen uniformly at random from @xmath16 . at step @xmath17 , the random variable @xmath18 is revealed and we have to decide whether we want to purchase the corresponding edge @xmath19 or not . + note that we evaluate the purchasing price of buying a subset of @xmath20 over different probability spaces for the two models .",
    "we evaluate it over a product space of the values of the costs for pom but over a product space of the values of the costs and the edge - orderings for rom . also observe that the expected cost of purchasing a structure in the rom setting is larger than the one in the pom model . that is because we can generate the rom model by imposing the randomness of the edges at the pom model by ourselves .",
    "we thus seek lower bounds for the pom model and upper bounds for the rom model .",
