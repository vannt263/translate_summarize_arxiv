    "our results agree with previous studies using similar data from the sdss over the same range of environments @xcite . within the umr framework",
    ", this dependence of metallicity on environment is expected if gas content varies with environment .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent , blind hi surveys of the galaxy population ( arecibo legacy fast alfa survey , alfalfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) measure the gas content of galaxies over a broader range of environments .",
    "galaxies in denser environments , in general , have less gas @xcite .",

    "metallicity is also reported to be anti - correlated with both the sfr and gas - content of galaxies . at fixed stellar mass ,",
    "low metallicity galaxies on average have more hi gas and have higher star formation rates @xcite . from these observations ,",
    "a galaxy at low density region is expected to have more gas and , as a result , lower metallicity .",
    "the umr framework provides a theoretical framework for interpreting the relation between stellar mass , metallicity and environment in terms of gas - content .",
    "metallicity measured from strong emission lines of hii regions is essentially a sfr - weighted average and is only sensitive to gas in the ism @xcite .",
    "thus , the use of metallicities as a proxy for gas content is complementary to direct measurements of cold gas which may be sensitive to gas distributed more broadly than the ism of galaxies .",
    "hi deficient galaxies in clusters have higher metallicity @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrate that in clusters the deficiency of hi directly impacts the gas - content of the interstellar medium .",
    "we extend these results based on analysis of cluster galaxies to a larger range of environments ; gas - content is weakly correlated with the large scale environment and this explains the subtle dependence of metallicities and specific star formation rates of galaxies on environment .    currently , direct measurements of hi gas mass are still largely confined to the local universe due to the sensitivity of observing facilities .",
    "for example , the alfalfa survey provides more than ten thousand sources , but it only reaches out to @xmath126 .",
    "measurements of metallicity provide an alternative to probe the gas content in star - forming galaxies .",
    "because this method measures strong optical emission lines , it can be applied to a large number of galaxies at higher redshifts with reasonable observing resource . with future large - scale spectroscopic surveys such as the subaru prime focus spectrograph ( pfs ) survey @xcite , this method can potentially estimate the gas content in star - forming galaxies out to higher redshifts .    for the umr model , the saturation metallicity @xmath63 depends on the nucleosynthetic yield and the net fraction of the oxygen formed in massive stars that is expelled from galaxies in outflows ; @xmath65 is set by the slope of the stellar mass  gas mass relation .",
    "show that @xmath63 and @xmath65 do not depend on redshift . here",
    "we show that these parameters do not depend on environment either .",
    "the insensitivity of these parameters to redshift and environment provides constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution which include star formation , feedback and gas flows . in particular , the slope of the relation between stellar mass and gas mass and the fraction of oxygen formed by galaxies which is expelled from the interstellar medium appear to be independent of redshift and the large scale environment .",
    "we examine the mz relation as a function of environment based on analysis of @xmath127 galaxies in the sdss .",
    "we show that the gas - phase metallicity has a weak dependence on the environment .",
    "the mz relation is a power - law at low stellar masses and saturates at high stellar masses .",
    "the shape of the mz relation does not depend on environment . the environmental dependence is completely parameterized by variation of the turnover stellar mass where the mz relation saturates ; the turnover mass is smaller in high density environments .",
    "at stellar masses below the turnover stellar mass , galaxies in higher local density regions have on average higher metallicity . above the turnover mass the metallicity saturates and",
    "thus is independent of environment .",
    "we interpret the environmental dependence of the mz relatoin using the analytical chemical evolution model of .",
    "based on comparing the best - fit parameters with the model we show that the turnover of the mz relation depends on the gas - content of galaxies . thus the gas content in star - forming galaxies is the most important parameter for understanding the impact of environment on the metallicity . the specific star formation has a corresponding dependence on the environment supporting our interpretation .",
    "we show that a @xmath128 change in gas content over the density regime probed in this study can explain the measured dependence of the metallicity and specific star formation rate on the environment .    modeling the mz relation",
    "provides a means to probe the average gas content in star - forming galaxies .",
    "this method can be applied to galaxies at higher redshifts . with large spectroscopic surveys , this method may be sensitive to few percent difference in gas mass , thus providing a powerful tool to study the gas content in star - forming galaxies through cosmic time .",
