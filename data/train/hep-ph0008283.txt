    "recently , h1 and zeus collaborations have reported  @xcite experimental data on the total ctoss section of inelastic open beauty photoproduction .",
    "a comparision of these results with nlo pqcd calculations shows that ones underestimate the cross section at hera energies .",
    "therefore , it would be certainly reasonable to try a different way .",
    "in the present note , we focus on the so called semihard approach  @xcite ( sha ) , which we had applied earlier to open heavy quark  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite photoproduction .    at the hera energies and beyond",
    ", the interaction dynamics is governed by the properties of parton distributions in the small @xmath3 region .",
    "this domain is characterized by the double inequality @xmath4 , which shows that the typical parton interaction scale @xmath5 ( mass @xmath6 or @xmath1 of heavy quark ) is much higher than the qcd parameter @xmath7 , but is much lower than the total c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath8 .",
    "the situation is therefore classified as `` semihard '' .",
    "the resummation @xcite of the terms @xmath9^n$ ] , @xmath10^n$ ] and @xmath11^n$ ] in sha results in the unintegrated parton distributions @xmath12 , which determine the probability to find a parton of type @xmath13 carrying the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 and transverse momentum @xmath14 at the probing scale @xmath15 .",
    "they obey the bfkl equation  @xcite and reduce to the conventional parton densities @xmath16 once the @xmath17 dependence is integrated out : @xmath18    to calculate the cross section of a physical process , the unintegrated functions @xmath19 have to be convoluted with off - mass shell matrix elements corresponding to the relevant partonic subprocesses . in the off - mass shell matrix element",
    "the virtual gluon polarization tensor is taken in the form of the sha prescription @xcite : @xmath20    in ref .",
    "@xcite was used phenominological parametrization for the unintegrated gluon distribution including an arbitrary normalization constant ( @xmath21 factor ) , which was obtained from a fit to @xmath22pair production at the tevatron @xcite . in our recent paper  @xcite",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of heavy quarkonium photoproduction to different gluon distributions .",
    "special attention was given to the unintegrated gluon distributions obtained from bfkl evolution equation .",
    "in this paper we study the sensitivity of the total cross section of inelastic charm abd beauty photoproduction to these unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "the outline of our paper is the following : in sect .",
    "2 , we give the formulas for the cross sections of heavy quark photoproduction in the sha of qcd .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "3 , we describe the unintegrated distributions which we use for our calculations . in sect .",
    "4 , we present the results of our calculations .",
    "finally , in sect .",
    "5 , we give some conclusions .",
    "we calculate the total and differential cross sections ( the @xmath23 and rapidity distributions ) of charm and beauty quark photoproduction via the photon - gluon fusion qcd subprocess ( fig.1 ) in the framework of the sha .",
    "first of all we take into account the transverse momentum of gluon @xmath24 , its the virtuality @xmath25 and the alignment of its polarization vectors along its transverse momentum such as @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "let us define sudakov variables of the process @xmath27 ( fig.1 ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are 4-momenta of the heavy quarks , @xmath32 is 4-momentum of the photon , @xmath33 is 4-momentum of the gluon , @xmath34 are transverse 4-momenta of these ones . in the center of mass frame of colliding particles",
    "we can write @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "sudakov variables are expressed as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are rapidities of heavy quarks , m is heavy quark mass .    from conservation laws",
    "we can easly obtain the following conditions : @xmath43 the differential cross section of heavy quark photoproduction has the following form @xmath44    the matrix element @xmath45 for a subprocess @xmath46 depends on the virtuality of the gluon and differs from the one of the usual parton model .",
    "for the square of this matrix element we used the following form  @xcite : @xmath47,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 are usual mandelstam variables of partonic subprocess @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper we used the different parametrizations for the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "first , as in the publication  @xcite , we used the following phenomenological parametrization ( lrss - parametrization )  @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55",
    ". the value of the parameter @xmath56 can be considered as a new typical transverse momentum of the partons in the parton cascade which leads to natural infrared cut - off in semihard approach .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath57 of the structure function @xmath58 was obtained in  @xcite , where beauty production at cdf energy was described , @xmath59 mb .    the effective gluon distribution @xmath60 , which was obtained from eq .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) , and eq .",
    "( 1 ) increases at not very low @xmath61 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 corresponds to the qcd pomeron singularity given by summation of leading logarithmic contributions ( @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "this increase continues up to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a solution of the equation @xmath67 . in the region",
    "@xmath68 , there is saturation of the gluon distribution function : @xmath69 .",
    "a second parametrization is based on the numerical solution of the bfkl evolution equations  @xcite ( rs  parametrization ) .",
    "the solution has the following form  @xcite : @xmath70 c_q [ \\frac{a_5}{a_5 + x}]^{1/2}[1 - \\nonumber \\\\",
    "a_6 x^{a_7}\\ln{(q^2/a_8 ) } ] ( 1 + a_{11 } x ) ( 1   - x)^{a_9 + a_{10}\\ln ( q^2/a_8)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 all parameters ( see  @xcite ) @xmath72 and @xmath73 were found by minimization of the differences between left hand and right - hand of the bfkl - type equation for unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath74 , @xmath754 gev@xmath76",
    ".    finally we also use the results of a bfkl - like parameterization of the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath77 , according to the prescription given in  @xcite .",
    "the proposed method lies upon a straightforward perturbative solution of the bfkl equation where the collinear gluon density @xmath78 from the standard grv set  @xcite is used as the boundary condition in the integral form ( 1 ) . technically , the unintegrated gluon density is calculated as a convolution of collinear gluon density @xmath79 with universal weight factors  @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 stand for bessel functions ( of real and imaginary arguments , respectively ) , and @xmath85 . the parameter @xmath86 is connected with the pomeron trajectory intercept : @xmath87 in the lo and @xmath88 in the nlo approximations , respectively , where @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the latter value of @xmath90 have dramatic consequences for high energy phenomenology .",
    "in particular it leads to negative values for physical cross sections  @xcite .",
    "however some resummation procedures proposed in the last years lead to positive value of @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "therefore in our calculations with ( 13 ) we used only the solution of lo bfkl equation and considered @xmath90 as free parameter varying it from 0.166 to 0.53 .",
    "the presence of the two different parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath92 , in eq.(12 ) for unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath77 refers to the fact that the evolution of parton densities proceeds in two steps .",
    "first the dglap scheme  @xcite is applied to evolve the structure function from @xmath93 to @xmath15 within the collinear approximation .",
    "after that eqs .",
    "( 12)-(14 ) are used to develop the parton transverse momenta @xmath94 in correspondence with bfkl evolution  @xcite .",
    "this approach was used for the description of @xmath1 spectrum of @xmath95 meson electroproduction at hera  @xcite and @xmath2 photoproduction  @xcite , where in the first case for pomeron intercept parameter was obtained the value @xmath96 .",
    "however for the total cross section of inelastic @xmath2 photoproduction @xmath97 is more preferable .",
    "the calculations of the heavy quark photoproduction cross section in the sha have been made accoding to eqns .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) for @xmath98 gev@xmath76 and for @xmath99 gev@xmath76 we set @xmath100 0 in the matrix element of process and use one of the standard partom model ( spm ) .",
    "the choice of the critical value of parameter @xmath101 gev@xmath76 is determined by the requirement of the small value of @xmath102 in the region @xmath103 gev@xmath76 , where in fact @xmath104 .",
    "gev@xmath76 instead 2 gev@xmath76 essentially influences on the dependence of cross sections from the bfkl parameterization of unintegrated gluon distribution . ]",
    "the results of our calculations for the cross sections of @xmath105 and @xmath106 photoproduction processes are shown in figs .",
    "2 shows the total cross section of the inelastic @xmath107 photoproduction at hera and fixed target energies as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the curves 3 , 4 and 5 correspond to the sha calculations with the rs , lrss and bfkl unintegrated gluon distributions at the pomeron intercept @xmath108 , @xmath109 gev and at values of @xmath110 and 1 gev@xmath76 accordingly .",
    "one can see that the sha curves 4 and 5 describe the data better than the spm ones ( 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the rs parameterization of the unintegrated gluon distribution gives the total cross section more close to spm result ( obtained with grv gluon density ) because of very large value of @xmath111 gev@xmath76 .",
    "the lrss parameterization of the unintegrated gluon distribution gives the cross section which stops to increase at energy @xmath112 gev because of saturation effects accounted for by the parameterizations ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "we would like to stress that account for saturation effects in the region @xmath113",
    "@xcite , does not contradict the h1 and zeus experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the bfkl parameterization ( curve 5 ) describes the h1 and zeus data very well at @xmath114 gev ( fig .",
    "3 ) the curves 3 , 4 and 5 obtained in the sha show more rapid growth with energy than those obtained in the spm with grv  @xcite(curve 2 ) and mt  @xcite ( curve 1 ) parameterizations .    in fig.4",
    "we show the dependence of the total cross section from @xmath90 parameter for the bfkl parametrization ( 13 ) - ( 15 ) at @xmath114 gev .",
    "the dependence is very weak in contrast with the dependence of the total inelastic @xmath2 photoproduction cross section @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations for the @xmath1 and rapidity @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) distributions of the c quarks at @xmath117 gev are shown in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "the sha curves 4 and 5 in fig .",
    "5 for the @xmath1 distribution are higher than those of the spm .",
    "it is effect of the sha broadening of @xmath1 spectra due to extra transverse momentum of the initial gluons  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the sha rapidity distributions ( fig .",
    "6 ) have more similar behaviour in wide rapidity region .",
    "7 shows the total cross section of inelastic @xmath118 photoproduction at hera energies as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the curves 3 , 4 and 5 correspond to the sha calculations with the rs , lrss and bfkl unintegrated gluon distributions at the pomeron intercept @xmath108 , @xmath119 gev and at values of @xmath110 and 1 gev@xmath76 accordingly .",
    "the h1  @xcite and emc  @xcite experimental data are described by the lrss parameterization ( curve 4 ) and the bfkl parameterization ( curve 5 in fig . 8)",
    "but at small value of @xmath120 gev only for the last parameterization .",
    "the results of the sha calculations for the @xmath1 and rapidity distributions of the b quarks at @xmath117 gev are shown in figs .",
    "the differences between sha curves and spm ones are more pronounced than in the c - quark case .",
    "we considered the process of inelastic heavy quark photoproduction at hera in the framework of the semihard qcd approach with emphasis on the bfkl dynamics of gluon distributions .",
    "we investigated total cross section of inelastic @xmath121 and @xmath122quark photoproduction and also @xmath1 and rapidity spectra as a function of different unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "it is shown that the description of the @xmath121quark inelastic cross section at hera energies is achieved in the cases of the lrss and bfkl parameterizations at @xmath123 were obtained rather in very different papers ( see , for example , @xcite -@xcite ) and in the l3 experiment @xcite . ] and at the values of @xmath109 and 1.3 gev and at @xmath124 and 1 gev@xmath76 accordingly .",
    "the cross section of inelastic @xmath122quark photoproduction at hera is described by the lrss parameterization at the value of @xmath119 gev and @xmath108 very well .",
    "the bfkl paremeterization with @xmath96 describes the h1 and emc experimental data at @xmath120 gev only .",
    "the dependence of the total cross section of inelastic open @xmath121 and @xmath122quark photoproduction on @xmath90 parameter for the bfkl parameterization ( 13 ) - ( 15 ) is very weak in contrast with the dependence of the total inelastic @xmath2 photoproduction cross section .",
