    "in such a case , we have to know the behaviour of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high energies because of the largeness of qcd corrections .",
    "there is a well - known fact that the cross section of the two - photon processes @xmath0 dominates over that of the one - photon annihilation processes @xmath1 in the electron - positron collisions at high energies  @xcite .",

    "in this kinematical region , the former photon is called the ` probe photon ' and the latter one is called the ` target photon ' ( see fig .  [ fig - thophotons ] ) .",
    "we can regard this two - photon process as the deep - inelastic scattering in the electron - positron collision where the target is a photon rather than a nucleon . in this point of view",
    ", we can define the photon structure functions as the analogues of the nucleon structure functions , and the photon structure functions are predicted by the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and qcd .",
    "one of the difference between the nucleon structure functions and the photon structure functions is the target mass ( @xmath6 ) dependence .",
    "the @xmath6 is not fixed for the virtual photon case , on the other hand , @xmath6 is fixed for the nucleon case .",

    "based on the recent results for the three - loop calculation for the photon - quark and the photon - gluon splitting functions ( anomalous dimensions )  @xcite , the unpolarised virtual photon structure function @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) was studied to the nnlo ( to the nlo )  @xcite , and the polarised virtual photon structure function @xmath16 was studied to the nlo in  @xcite .    in the parton picture , the photon structure function is expressed as the convolution of the parton distribution function ( pdf ) in the virtual photon with the coefficient functions in the ope formalism .",
    "we can also give the definite prediction for the pdfs inside the photon , which we call photon pdfs  for short , in the present paper .",

    "one can solve the dglap equation ( [ dglap ] ) by introducing the moments of the photon pdfs  @xcite .",
