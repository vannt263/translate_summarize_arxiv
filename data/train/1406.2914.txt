    "the channel variables that modify the ionic conductances represent the fraction of open channels .",
    "the fraction of open channels is a continuous , deterministic quantity if ( i ) the number of ion channels is taken to be infinite while the conductance of an single channel vanishes or ( ii ) channels open and close infinitely fast so that the fraction of open channels is an instantaneous function of the voltage . for the ml model",
    ", the potassium channel variable @xmath2 is obtained by the former while the sodium channel variable @xmath8 is determined by the latter .",
    "note that @xmath2 is a dynamic variable with its own governing equation while @xmath9 can be viewed as the quasi - steady - state fraction of open sodium channels .",
    "the deterministic ml model can display several different types of excitable behavior .",
    "in every case , there is a single stable fixed point representing the resting voltage and we assume that the applied current @xmath10 is below threshold so that the deterministic system does not exhibit repetitive firing . below threshold , only current fluctuations from stochastic ion channels can induce an excitable event .",
    "if current fluctuations push the system over a voltage threshold to the excited state , the voltage undergoes a transient spike called an action potential before returning to the resting voltage .",
    "we consider two situations .",
    "a type i neuron has three fixed points : a stable fixed point corresponding to the resting state , an unstable saddle , and an unstable fixed point corresponding to the excited state .",
    "a type ii neuron has one fixed point corresponding to the stable resting state .",
    "deterministic repetitive firing can occur in type i and ii neurons when the input current is increased above threshold @xcite .    in most physically relevant cases ,",
    "the system is close to the deterministic limit so that the ion channel fluctuations are weak compared to the deterministic forces . in other words , a deterministic trajectory and a stochastic trajectory that share",
    "the same initial conditions are likely to remain close over sufficiently small time scales .",
    "this situation is commonly referred to as _",
    "weak noise_. under weak noise conditions , a rare sequence of fluctuations can cause metastable dynamical behavior that the deterministic model can not describe .",
    "metastable behavior occurs on long timescales .",
    "a spontaneous excitable event can naturally be separated into two phases : the initiation phase and the excitation phase .",
    "the initiation phase is driven by ion channel fluctuations and is therefore a metastable transition .",
    "the excitation phase begins once fluctuations increase the voltage to a threshold .",
    "then , the system undergoes a transient increase in voltage before returning to the stable fixed point . unlike the initiation phase ,",
    "the excitation phase is not metastable , instead being driven primarily by deterministic forces .",

    ", the probability that the process takes a particular path from point a to point b is sharply peaked along a _ most probable path _ ( mpp ) .",
    "a mpp is a statistic , similar to the mode , of a probability distribution functional over the function space of continuous paths .",
    "although they describe a stochastic process , mpps themselves are not stochastic .",
    "one can show using _",
    "large deviations theory _",
    "@xcite that the likelihood of deviating from the mpp is an exponentially decreasing function of the magnitude of the deviation .",
    "in other words , stochastic trajectories are highly likely to closely follow the mpp . in general , there are two kinds of mpps .",
    "any deterministic trajectory connecting point a to point b is a mpp .",
    "if there is no deterministic path that connects the two points and the transition is noise induced metastable transition , mpps build _ action _ and become more improbable as the path gets longer .",
    "the action is a measure of how improbable the mpp is . by themselves , mpps provide a good qualitative description of how different metastable transitions occur ; they can be thought of as describing noise induced dynamical behavior .",
    "mpps can also be used to approximate other important properties of the stochastic process .",
    "one can show that there is a nontrivial connection between mpps that start at the stable fixed point and the stationary probability density function , which describes the relative fraction of time the system spends in different dynamical regimes and determines how rare excitable events are .",
    "since stochastic trajectories leading from the stable resting voltage to the threshold of an excitable event are described by mpps , it is no surprise that mpps determine the asymptotics of the average metastable transition time , also called the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) or mean exit time .",

    "recently , the authors have studied type ii excitability in the stochastic ml model with channel noise , deriving mpps using the wkb method @xcite .",
    "while the results showed excellent agrement with monte carlo simulations , a systematic connection between large deviation theory and the wkb method was not established .",

    "the connection between wkb and large deviation theory is well studied for continuous markov process @xcite and for birth - death processes @xcite .",
    "establishing such a connection for the stochastic ml model is complicated by the presence of fast and slow variables in a stochastic process that has both continuous and discrete elements .",
