    "the yang  baxter equation originally appeared in statistical physics and in quantum integrable systems , and its study has then led to the discovery of quantum groups , which have found numerous applications in mathematics and mathematical physics ( for literature on the yang ",
    "baxter equation and related subjects , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) .    the fusion procedure for the yang  baxter equation allows the construction of new solutions of the yang  baxter equation starting from a given fundamental solution .",
    "we refer to the new solutions as `` fused '' solutions of the yang  baxter equation .",
    "the fusion procedure has first been introduced in @xcite .",
    "several aspects of the fusion procedure for the yang  baxter equation and of its applications to theoretical physics can be found for example in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we start by reviewing the fusion procedure for an arbitrary fundamental solution of the yang  baxter equation , together with the identification and the study of distinguished invariant subspaces for the fused solutions .",
    "we provide complete proofs as the details are scattered in the literature and as , moreover , often only some particular solutions , depending on the physical model under consideration , were considered .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite - dimensional complex vector space .",
    "starting from an arbitrary solution @xmath1 of the yang ",
    "baxter equation on @xmath2 ( see section [ sec - prel ] for more precision ) , a fused solution is built given two sets of complex numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 and is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the element @xmath5 is an endomorphism of the vector space @xmath6 .",
    "linear subspaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constructed , with the property that the fused solution @xmath5 preserves the subspace @xmath9 of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , by restriction , the operator @xmath5 induces a solution of the yang ",
    "baxter equation acting on the space @xmath9 .",
    "a crucial feature of the invariant subspaces is that , for any @xmath3 , the subspace @xmath11 is defined as the image of an endomorphism @xmath12 of @xmath13 , and moreover the endomorphism @xmath12 is expressed in terms of the original solution @xmath1 .",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted first to the review of the identification of interesting spaces among the spaces @xmath11 when @xmath1 is the so - called yang solution .",
    "then we generalize the obtained results to the case where @xmath1 is a generalization of the yang solution for a @xmath14-graded vector space @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ a  super \" vector space ) , and to the case where @xmath1 is the standard deformation of the yang solution , both in the usual and @xmath14-graded situations .    for the yang solution ,",
    "the main result is the identification of subspaces @xmath11 which are isomorphic to finite - dimensional irreducible representations of the general linear lie algebra @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "it results in a family of fused solutions of the yang ",
    "baxter equation acting on finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a partition of length less than or equal to @xmath16 .",
    "a subspace @xmath11 isomorphic to the irreducible representation of highest weight @xmath17 is obtained when the set of numbers @xmath18 is a string of classical contents associated to a standard young tableau of shape @xmath17 .",
    "we show moreover that , by replacing the set @xmath18 by a string of contents associated to another standard young tableau of the same shape , we obtain an equivalent fused solution up to a change of basis .",
    "as it is suggested in @xcite , the study of the subspaces @xmath11 when @xmath1 is the yang solution is made using the classical schur  weyl duality ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) together with the so - called `` fusion formula '' for the symmetric group . the fusion formula for the symmetric group @xmath19 originates in @xcite and has then been developed in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the fusion formula expresses each element of a complete set of primitive idempotents of the group ring @xmath20 as a certain evaluation of a rational function in several variables with coefficients in @xmath20 ( the rational function is the same for all the idempotents ) .",
    "as the name suggests , the fusion formula is intimately related to the fusion procedure .",
    "indeed the rational function is built from elementary `` universal '' solutions of the yang ",
    "baxter equation , called baxterized elements of @xmath20 , and it turns out that its expression reproduces the expression for the operator @xmath12 , mentioned above , in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is the generalization of the yang solution for a @xmath14-graded vector space @xmath21 , we still can use the fusion formula for the symmetric group @xmath19 .",
    "however , in this situation , another action of @xmath19 on @xmath13 is relevant .",
    "this action gives rise to a  super \" analogue of the classical schur ",
    "weyl duality @xcite , which holds between the symmetric group and the general linear lie superalgebra @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with these tools , generalizing the preceding results concerning the yang solution , we obtain a family of fused solutions of the yang  baxter equation acting on finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath22 .    for the standard deformation of the yang solution , we use the fusion formula for the hecke algebra @xcite together with the quantum analogue of the schur ",
    "weyl duality @xcite .",
    "this duality holds between the hecke algebra and the quantum group @xmath25 associated to @xmath15 .",
    "then we apply the fusion procedure to obtain a family of fused solutions of the yang ",
    "baxter equation acting on finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath25 .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 are now related to quantum contents of standard young tableaux . here again , replacing a standard young tableau by another standard young tableau of the same shape leads to equivalent fused solutions up to a change of basis .",
    "the standard deformation of the yang solution also admits a generalization for a @xmath14-graded vector space @xmath0 and we obtain in this case , via the fusion procedure , solutions of the yang  baxter equation acting on finite - dimensional irreducible representations of a deformation @xmath26 of @xmath27 .",
    "in this situation , we use the analogue of the schur - weyl duality between the hecke algebra and @xmath26 proved in @xcite .    for an arbitrary fundamental solution @xmath1",
    ", we study the possible equivalence of the fused solutions under a permutation of the parameters @xmath3 . by `` equivalence '' of two fused solutions ,",
    "we mean that the two corresponding invariant subspaces have the same dimension , and moreover the restrictions of the fused solutions to these subspaces coincide up to a change of basis .",
    "assuming an unitary property for @xmath1 , we obtain that particular permutations ( that we call `` admissible '' for @xmath18 and @xmath1 , see subsection [ subsec - dep ] ) of the parameters @xmath3 lead to equivalent fused solutions . for the four solutions @xmath1 considered above ,",
    "the fact that the fused solutions depend on the standard young tableaux only through their shapes is a consequence of this general property .",
    "we notice that , even for solutions @xmath1 considered in this paper , the study of ( proper ) invariant subspaces for the fused solutions is , though quite satisfactory , not fully complete .",
    "namely , it is still an open problem to determine all the sets of parameters @xmath18 such that the operator @xmath12 is non - invertible ( and thus leads to a proper invariant subspace ) and to study the obtained fused solutions .",
    "even the classification of the sets of parameters @xmath18 such that the operator @xmath12 is proportional to a projector is not completely understood .",
    "one motivation for a detailed study of the fusion procedure for an arbitrary solution of the yang ",
    "baxter equation came from recent results generalizing the fusion formula of the symmetric group and of the hecke algebra to several other structures : the brauer algebras @xcite , the birman ",
    "murakami algebras @xcite , the complex reflection groups of type @xmath28 @xcite , the ariki  koike algebras @xcite and the wreath products of finite groups by the symmetric group @xcite .",
    "these fusion formulas involve as well a rational function ( with coefficients in the algebras under consideration ) which is built from elementary  universal \" solutions of the yang ",
    "baxter equation , the analogues for these structures of the baxterized elements of @xmath20 .",
    "however , in these fusion formulas , baxterized solutions of the reflection equation also appear in the rational functions .",
    "it is therefore expected , as it is already mentioned in @xcite , that these fusion formulas admit an interpretation in the framework of the fusion procedure for the reflection equation .",
    "we postpone to another article an analogous study of the fusion procedure for the reflection equation and of invariant subspaces of the fused solutions of the reflection equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - prel ] ,",
    "we give necessary definitions and notations .    in section [ sec - fus ] , starting from an arbitrary solution @xmath1 of the yang ",
    "baxter equation acting on @xmath2 , we describe the construction of the endomorphisms @xmath5 and prove that the obtained operators @xmath5 are solutions of the yang ",
    "baxter equation as well .    in section [ sec - inv ]",
    ", we define endomorphisms @xmath12 and show that their images provide invariant subspaces for the fused solutions .",
    "we also give an alternative formula for @xmath12 and prove the equivalence of the fused solutions under admissible permutation of the parameters @xmath18 . both sections [ sec - fus ] and [ sec - inv ] deal with an arbitrary solution @xmath1 of the yang ",
    "baxter equation ( only the unitary property is assumed in subsection [ subsec - dep ] ) .    in section [ sec - sn ]",
    ", we apply the whole procedure to the situation where @xmath1 is the yang solution , and identify invariant subspaces isomorphic to finite - dimensional irreducible representations of the general linear lie algebra .",
    "the main results are summarized in corollary [ coro - fin - sn ] .",
    "we also provide explicit examples of fused solutions and discuss open problems concerning  non - standard \" evaluations of the fusion function .    in sections [ sec - sn - s ] and [ sec - hn ] ,",
    "we generalize the results of the preceding section to the situation where @xmath1 is a generalization of the yang solution for a super vector space and where @xmath1 is the standard deformation of the yang solution or of its  super \" generalization .",
