    "percolation is arguably the simplest example of a planar `` critical '' model , i.e. a random planar graph ( generally speaking a subgraph of a regular lattice , eventually with spins on sites ) with a small mesh such that the probabilities of geometrically meaningful macroscopic events have non degenerate limits when the mesh goes to zero . recall that percolation consists in removing each edge ( or each vertex ) in a lattice with a given probability @xmath0 ; bond percolation on the square lattice and site percolation on the triangular lattice are critical for @xmath1 .",
    "the probabilities of macroscopic events are generally believed to be conformally invariant : the limiting probability when the mesh of the lattice goes to zero should not change if one applies a conformal equivalence to the corresponding geometric configuration .",
    "an important related example is the conformal invariance of hitting probabilities ( harmonic measure ) for planar brownian motion , which is the scaling limit of simple random walks . using techniques from conformal field theory ( cft ) and coulomb gas models ,",
    "physicists have proposed several intriguing formulas for the limiting probabilities of critical percolation .",
    "unfortunately , it does not seem easy to make their arguments rigorous .",
    "we now review some of these predictions .    *",
    "simply connected domains + mark four points on the boundary of a simply connected domain to get a conformal rectangle ; up to conformal equivalence , there is only one degree of freedom , namely the aspect ratio of the rectangle .",
    "the probability that two opposite sides of the rectangle are connected by a percolation cluster is given by cardy s formula ( @xcite ) .",
    "watts formula ( @xcite ) describes the probability of a double crossing , i.e. the two pairs of opposite sides are all connected by one cluster .",
    "cardy has also studied the occurrence of @xmath2 disjoint clusters connecting two opposite sides ( @xcite ) . *",
    "multiply connected domains + a @xmath2-connected domain is a plane connected domain the complement in @xmath3 of which has @xmath2 connected components ( its fundamental group is the free group on @xmath4 generators ) .",
    "a natural question concerns the probability that two given connected components of the boundary are connected by a cluster inside the domain .",
    "the simplest case is the existence of a crossing from the outer to the inner boundary of an annulus .",
    "more generally , a law for the number of crossings of alternate colors has been proposed by cardy ( @xcite ) . *",
    "compact riemann surfaces + here there is no boundary ; tori are the simplest example",
    ". since the conformal structure is of crucial importance , it may be better to think of ( complex ) elliptic curves .",
    "pinson ( @xcite ) has studied the image of the ( first ) homology group of clusters of a given color in the homology group of the torus ( i.e. a random subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "since a continuous random graph does not really make sense , one has first to clarify what these limiting probabilities do correspond to .",
    "a natural way to understand the `` continuous scaling limit of critical percolation '' is to focus on the interfaces between clusters , which are random curves .",
    "the limiting probabilistic objects ( random curves ) are the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) , introduced by schramm in @xcite ( see @xcite for some background on sle ) .",
    "it describes the only possible conformally invariant scaling limits of these interfaces .",
    "for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice , smirnov ( @xcite ) has proved that the cluster interface indeed converges to the so - called chordal @xmath6 process .",
    "his proof in fact relies on establishing directy cardy s formula for single crossings in conformal rectangles .",
    "hence it may be interesting to derive some percolation probabilities in the @xmath6 framework .",
    "cardy s formula itself is easily derived for the @xmath6 , as pointed out by schramm ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the general idea is that if one wants to compute probabilities of macroscopic events in terms of the @xmath6 process , one uses the fact that the conditional probabilities ( using the filtration associated to the @xmath6 ) of this event are a martingale .",
    "this leads ( usually ) to a partial differential equation ( in terms of the `` conformal coordinates '' of the problem ) , that characterize fully these probabilities .",
    "this method has been used in @xcite to derive a new formula for critical percolation , and also in @xcite to derive the value of the corresponding critical exponents ( that describe the asymptotic decay of the probabilities of some events ) .    in the present paper",
    "we derive analytic characterizations of some percolation probabilities in annuli using smirnov s result on convergence of the percolation exploration process to @xmath6 .",
    "the computations are somewhat tedious , but the underlying probabilistic ideas are extremely simple , and may be of use for more general problems ( in particular for @xmath2-connected domains , @xmath7 ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a @xmath2-connected domains and @xmath9 be one connected component of its boundary ( a jordan closed curve , say ) .",
    "pick two points @xmath10 and @xmath11 on @xmath9 and set the following boundary conditions on @xmath9 : the arc @xmath12 is colored in blue and the arc @xmath13 in yellow ( in clockwise order ) .",
    "chordal event _ is a percolation event depending only on @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , consider the event that there exists a blue crossing between @xmath12 and @xmath15 and a yellow crossing between @xmath13 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are connected components of @xmath18 .",
    "then `` grow '' a small percolation ( resp .",
    "@xmath6 ) hull at @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath19 be this hull ( @xmath20 is a measure of its size ) and @xmath21 be its `` tip ''",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) ; then @xmath22 is the perturbed domain . for a well chosen chordal event",
    ", the event holds in @xmath14 if and only if it holds in @xmath22 .",
    "now consider the set of @xmath23-connected domain with two points marked on a connected component of the boundary modulo conformal equivalence ( a teichmller space ) ; it is a manifold of dimension @xmath24 if @xmath25",
    ". then @xmath26 ( modulo conformal equivalence ) should be , up to time change , a diffusion in the teichmller space ; as percolation is local , it does not `` feel '' the boundary before actually touching it .",
    "the probability of the chordal event defines a function on this space and this function is harmonic for the diffusion .",
    "if one is able to compute a sde for the diffusion and , crucially , to work out boundary conditions for the harmonic function , this yields an analytic characterization of the chordal event probability ( as a function on the teichmller space ) .    in the paper",
    ", we essentially carry out this program for annuli . in the first section",
    ", we recall some facts of complex analysis on the annulus ( mainly the solution to the dirichlet problem ) .",
    "next , we derive the sde for the diffusion in the teichmller space ( which is isomorphic to @xmath27 ) . in the third section , we characterize the law of the number of nested clusters of alternate colors wrapped around the inner disk of an annulus , and make the connection with cardy s results ( see @xcite ) .    defining sle on riemann surfaces",

    "moreover , any doubly connected domain ( i.e. a connected domain the complement in @xmath3 of which has two connected components ) is conformally equivalent to an annulus .",
    "thus , one may identify the teichmller space of doubly connected domains with the set @xmath36 .",
    "let us briefly recall villat s solution of the dirichlet problem in an annulus @xcite .",
    "let @xmath37 , @xmath38 be two continuous , real - valued @xmath39-periodic functions .",
    "the dirichlet problem consists in finding a real harmonic function @xmath40 defined in @xmath31 with boundary values given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the classical dirichlet problem in the disk may be solved using the poisson kernel . in the case of annuli",

    "define also : @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 defines a real harmonic function on an annulus which is not the real part of an holomorphic function on this annulus .",

    "note that this sde is invariant under @xmath132 , which is obvious from the definition of @xmath133 .",
    "the principle of this computation is closely related to the approach of locality / restriction in @xcite .",

    "note also that we could have begun with any configuration conformally equivalent to @xmath134 , getting the same dynamics for @xmath133 , hence the same percolation probabilities .",
    "the previous computations may be used to study various critical percolation probabilities in the annulus .",
    "for instance , consider the following crossing probability : @xmath135 is the probability that there exists a blue crossing between the arc @xmath136 and the inner circle @xmath71 in the annulus @xmath31 and a yellow crossing between @xmath137 and @xmath71 , with @xmath138 .",
    "it follows from the previous section that : @xmath139 and @xmath140 satisfies the boundary conditions : @xmath141 , @xmath142 for all @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "this last condition is a consequence of the russo - seymour - welsh theory .",
    "consider @xmath145 as a two dimensional diffusion in the half - strip @xmath146 .",
    "this half - strip may be identified with the teichmller space of doubly connected plane domains with two marked boundary points ( on the same connected component of the boundary ) modulo conformal equivalence .",
    "the diffusion is stopped when it hits @xmath147 $ ] and is instantaneously reflected on @xmath148 . for any @xmath149 , this defines a harmonic measure seen from @xmath47 on @xmath147 $ ] .",
    "the restriction of this probability measure to @xmath150 is a finite measure ( not a probability measure ) , which we shall note @xmath151 . for @xmath152 , note @xmath153 .",
    "thus we have defined a defective markov kernel on @xmath150 ( identified with doubly connected domains modulo conformal equivalence ) . from a probabilistic point of view , this is equivalent to a ( discrete time ) markov chain on @xmath154 , where @xmath9 is a cemetery state .",
    "the number of steps taken by this markov chain ( starting from @xmath155 ) before reaching @xmath9 corresponds to the number of downcrossings and upcrossings of @xmath133 ( starting from @xmath39 at time @xmath11 ) . for a given @xmath11",
    ", @xmath156 is a solution of the pde ( [ pde ] ) with boundary conditions : @xmath157 for all @xmath144 , and , on @xmath150 , @xmath158 , the dirac mass at @xmath11 . on @xmath148 , there is a neumann boundary condition : @xmath159 for all @xmath160 , just as in @xcite , lemma 2.3 .",
    "we now interpret downcrossings and upcrossings of @xmath133 in terms of the exploration process .",
    "see also @xcite for a discussion of percolation events in annuli in relation with the exploration process ( and nice figures ! ) . for the sake of simplicity , consider critical site percolation on the triangular lattice : each vertex of the triangular lattice ( or each hexagon of a honeycomb lattice ) is colored in blue or yellow with probability @xmath161 .",
    "consider a portion of this lattice ( with small mesh ) that approximates the annulus @xmath31 .",
    "two points are marked on the outer boundary , say @xmath10 and @xmath78 ; the arc @xmath162 is colored in blue and the arc @xmath163 is colored in yellow .",
    "the exploration process from @xmath10 to @xmath78 ( which is well defined as long as it does not hit @xmath71 ) is the path with only blue hexagons on its left - hand and yellow ones on its right - hand .",
    "the exploration process completes a clockwise loop if there is a blue circuit of hexagons around the inner disk @xmath164 and a counterclockwise loop if there is a yellow circuit .",
    "it hits the inner disk before completing a circuit if there is a blue crossing from @xmath162 to @xmath71 and a yellow one from @xmath163 to @xmath71 . in the following",
    ", a circuit will always be a circuit around @xmath164 , and a crossing will always be a crossing between @xmath165 and @xmath71 in @xmath31 .    in the continuous setting , starting from @xmath166 , if @xmath167 reaches @xmath168 , then the boundary `` seen from the inner disk '' is completely yellow ; this means that the exploration process has completed a counterclockwise loop ( including the yellow arc @xmath163 ) .",
    "hence , starting from @xmath169 , the process @xmath133 reaches @xmath168 before time @xmath168 if and only if there is a yellow circuit inside the annulus ( the outer circle is blue ) .",
    "then @xmath133 reflects instantaneously on @xmath150 , which means that the exploration process proceeds towards @xmath164 in a conformal annulus the outer boundary of which ( i.e. the circuit ) is yellow .",
    "thus a downcrossing for @xmath170 means that there exists a yellow circuit ( here @xmath165 is blue ) ; a downcrossing followed by an upcrossing means that there exists a yellow circuit and a blue circuit nested in the yellow one ; and so on .",
    "now set free boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath171 denote the event that there is no circuit ( blue or yellow ) ; equivalently , there is a blue crossing and a yellow one . for @xmath172 ,",
    "let @xmath173 be the event that there is exactly @xmath2 disjoint clusters of alternate colors wrapped around @xmath164 and the outermost is blue ; @xmath174 is the corresponding events with colors changed ( see figure ) .",
    "obviously @xmath175 and : @xmath176 it follows from the previous discussion that the probability @xmath177 that @xmath133 starting from @xmath178 makes at least @xmath2 alternate downcrossings and upcrossings is : @xmath179 where @xmath180 designates the convolution of markov kernels and @xmath181 is the constant function .",
    "note that we have analytically characterized @xmath182 . here",
    "one should be cautious because of the boundary conditions .",
    "the number @xmath177 is the probability to see at least @xmath2 circuits of alternate colors , not counting the outermost one if it is blue .",
    "this outermost circuit is either blue or yellow , so : @xmath183 determining @xmath184 from the @xmath185 is then a trivial problem of ( infinite dimensional ) linear algebra . in the frchet space of rapidly decaying series ,",
    "consider the vectors @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and the bounded operator : @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the left shift : @xmath190 .",
    "then @xmath191 . as ( a little formally ) @xmath192",
    ", one gets @xmath193 . hence : @xmath194 with the conventions @xmath195 , @xmath196 .",
    "note that @xmath197 decays exponentially : once a circuit has been completed , the `` new annulus '' has a greater modulus that the initial one , and the greater the modulus , the lesser the probability that there exists circuits .",
    "hence @xmath198 , and @xmath199 from the rsw theory ( one may also argue using the bk inequality rather than the previous `` renewal '' argument ) . similarly , @xmath200 decays exponentially , which justifies the previous formal argument .",
    "let @xmath201 be the number of downcrossings and upcrossings completed by the diffusion @xmath133 starting from @xmath202 , and @xmath203 be the random sign : @xmath204 the sum is finite a.s . from the preceding discussion , @xmath205 as functions of @xmath206 .",
    "note that @xmath207 if the last visited boundary half - line is the top one , and @xmath208 in the other case .",
    "since @xmath133 and @xmath209 have the same law , if follows that : @xmath210 for all @xmath211",
    ". moreover , if @xmath133 does not reach the half - line @xmath212 , then @xmath207 ( since paths are continuous ) . hence , by the markov property : @xmath213 so we can characterize @xmath214 as the solution of a first exit problem : consider the diffusion @xmath133 starting from @xmath47 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 ( using the symmetry @xmath217 ) , stopped at time @xmath218 when it exits the half - strip @xmath219 , the bottom part of the boundary being instantaneously reflecting ; either @xmath220 or @xmath221 a.s . then",
