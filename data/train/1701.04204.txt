    "the surface of these objects directly interacts with the space environment , resulting in sputtering , radiolysis , and sublimation .",
    "these processes lead to a tenuous , surface - bound atmosphere . for the galilean icy moons , it is often referred to as ` exosphere ' since the mean free path length usually is larger than the atmospheric scale height @xcite . a few species of these atmospheres have been measured by remote sensing techniques . at callisto ,",
    "only co@xmath0 has been detected so far , with a surface pressure as low as 10@xmath1 mbar @xcite .",
    "for ganymede and europa , @xcite reported the detection of oxygen airglow , implying atmospheric o@xmath0 pressures on the order of 10@xmath1 mbar ( column densities of several 10@xmath2 @xmath3 ) .",
    "atomic oxygen , one to two orders of magnitude more tenuous , was observed by @xcite at europa .",
    "the o and o@xmath0 column densities of europa were later confirmed during the cassini flyby with the ultraviolet imaging spectrograph @xcite .",
    "a tenuous na and k atmosphere around europa was detected with ground - based observation in the visible spectral range @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of atomic hydrogen in ganymede s atmosphere with the galileo ultraviolet spectrometer , whereas @xcite and @xcite reported the detection of condensed or trapped o@xmath0 and o@xmath4 in the surface of ganymede .",
    "the latter discovery showed that the atmospheric oxygen species are indeed surface - bound .",
    "unfortunately , properties of ices at low pressures and temperatures , such as the sputtering efficiency due to ion bombardment , are difficult to predict theoretically and it is not always clear how results from laboratory experiments should be applied to real ice surfaces in the solar system @xcite .",
    "this limits the predictive capability of any surface and atmosphere model .",
    "the juice mission @xcite , scheduled to visit europa , ganymede , and callisto in the years 20302032 , will allow to directly sample the particles ejected from the surface and also to observe the atmosphere at infrared , visible , and ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "the design of instruments would benefit from better constrained parameters for surface release processes .    over the last two decades",
    ", several laboratory experiments simulating particle irradiation of water ice on the surface of icy moons have been performed @xcite , and these data have been put into the context of planetary science @xcite .",
    "most approaches aimed at deriving the sputtering yields , i.e. , the ratio of ejected water ice molecules per impinging ion or electron as a function of impactor energy .",
    "the favourite technique used so far consists of vapour depositing a thin film ( @xmath5 nm ) of compact ( density @xmath6 g @xmath7 ) amorphous ice onto a quartz microbalance @xcite .",
    "the ice film is then gradually sputtered and the observed frequency change of the quartz crystal allows to deduce the sputtering yield .",
    "in contrast , we experiment with ions impacting a 0.9 cm thick sample of porous water ice to simulate the regolith on the surface of an icy moon .",
    "`` porosity '' in this study always implies macroporosity , i.e. , micron - sized gaps between grains , as opposed to nano - scale pores within a grain @xcite .",
    "our approach allows us to produce samples with chemical impurities and to study the impact of porosity on release processes .",
    "so far , sputtering models disagree whether the sputtering yield from a porous solid should be substantially lower @xcite or similar @xcite compared to the same non - porous solid",
    ".    experimental difficulties arising from sputtering experiments with a cm - thick ice sample include a strong surface charging due to ion irradation and a more urgent need to characterize the sample ( for instance density , chemical alterations , and possible temperature gradients between the bottom and the surface ) .",
    "our first sputtering experiments with h@xmath8 , o@xmath8 , o@xmath9 , and ar@xmath8 ions @xcite indicated that surface charging of the ice sample could affect estimates of the sputtering yield .",
    "the charging also limited the number of unbiased experiments per day since the discharging times exceeded one hour for cold ( @xmath10 k ) ice if no countermeasures were employed .",
    "our improved set - up for sputtering experiments with porous ice allows us to detect and counteract surface charging caused by ion irradiation .",
    "this paper describes the new set - up and presents the first ar@xmath8 sputtering results obtained with it .",
    "the mefisto test facility for space instrument calibration has been developed over more than a decade @xcite .",
    "it consists of a vacuum chamber and an electron - cyclotron - resonance ion source .",
    "@xcite examined the charge exchange of an ion beam on an ice surface in mefisto to prepare for an energetic neutral atom imaging instrument on board juice .",
    "we present here how the same test facility and a similar set - up can be used to simulate ion sputtering of porous icy material in space .",
    "we prepared porous water ice with the spipa ( setup for the production of icy planetary analogs ) setup described as method # 1 by @xcite .",
    "an ultrasonic nebulizer produces micrometer sized droplets of salty water ( 99% weight percent de - ionized water and 1%  nacl ) .",
    "we added the nacl to discriminate sputtering of the salty ice from sputtering of the top frost layer originating from exposure to air .",
    "the water droplets were frozen and piled up in a cooled bowl ( @xmath11c ) as spherical ice particles with diameters of @xmath12 @xmath13 m ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : freshice ] ) . once enough ice was produced , we poured liquid nitrogen into the bowl and stirred up the suspension with a spoon .",
    "this method prevented the grains from sintering and allowed us to pour the ice into the sample holder .",
    "a microscope image of ice grains after this step is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : freshice ] .",
    "we then compressed the ice in the sample holder with the spoon until we had a smooth surface at the same level as the metal rim .",
    "we did this to improve the temperature conductivity compared to the very porous ice in the ice bowl .",
    "the bulk density of the final ice sample ranged between 200 and 300 kg m@xmath14 , corresponding to an average porosity of 75% .",
    "the ice in the sample holder is a realistic approximation for surfaces on the icy moons of jupiter , considering the limited knowledge about these surfaces .",
    "the temperature of the ice in the sample holder was kept at temperatures between 90 and 140 k , representative for the surfaces of ganymede @xcite and europa @xcite .",
    "the na content of our ice is representative for ice - rich areas on europa s surface ( the average mass abundance of na on europa s ridged plains calculates to 2% @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "assume porosities ranging between 0.4 to almost 1.0 for the galilean moons to fit solar phase curve reflectances .",
    "the authors conclude with respect to europa : `` the high porosity for europa is consistent with a medium to fine - grained water frost . ''",
    "the grain size on the surface of the galilean moons probably is somewhat larger than in our unsintered ice . @xcite",
    "use typically 100 @xmath13 m sized ice grains to fit infrared spectra . when the ion sputtering experiment in the vacuum chamber starts , the ice grains will have undergone sintering to a small degree because of the residence time in the freezer and in the vacuum chamber before the latter is cooled down to experiment temperatures",
    ". moreover , the sample is covered with a thin water frost layer . however , sintering and frost deposition are also considered to reproduce infrared spectra of icy satellites @xcite .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=100.0% ]      figures [ fig : schematic ] and [ fig : picture ] show a drawing and a photograph of our experiment set - up .",
    "the porous ice is inside an aluminum sample holder with a circular mound ( radius 2 cm and depth 0.9 cm ) .",
    "the sample holder itself is screwed onto a steel plate which is being cooled with liquid nitrogen throughout the entire experiment .",
    "the ion beam impacts the ice sample at a flat angle of @xmath15 ( from the left hand side in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] ) .",
    "this angle could not be varied during the suite of experiments described here as we tested a simplified set - up without a maneuverable mounting table .",
    "we will vary the ion incidence angle in future experiments because the sputtering yield is expected to decrease at steeper angles ( see section [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "electrostatic deflection plates ( labelled `` beam guiding '' in the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) between the beam exit and the ice serve to direct the ion beam to any target area on the ice , the copper ring , or on the cooling plate around it . the copper ring around the ice acts as a faraday cup measuring the current of impacting ions and electrons .",
    "the faraday cup is operated at a positive potential of 18 v to prevent escaping secondary electrons from distorting the measurement .",
    "an electron gun ( nominal energy range 100 ev to 10 kev , manufacturer : kimball physics ) and a mass spectrometer ( hal quadrupole gas analyser , manufacturer : hiden analytical ) are mounted to the ceiling of the vacuum chamber , 80 cm above the ice sample .",
    "the electron gun is necessary to counter the surface charging effect due to ions .",
    "the photograph in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] was obtained at the start of the experiment when water frost from the ambient air had condensed on all cold surfaces .",
    "afterwards we closed the chamber and started fast evacuation .",
    "a close - up image of the ice sample obtained with a webcam was saved in a regular interval .",
    "because the electron gun , the mass spectrometer , and the ion beam require a vacuum pressure of @xmath16 mbar or lower we started sputtering experiments only after pumping and cooling for roughly 20 hours .",
    "the experiment usually ran during one week .    throughout the measurements we relied on temperature sensors to monitor the temperature of the chamber wall , the cooling plate , and of the ice sample holder (",
    "note the wires attached to screws in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] ) .",
    "the surface temperature of the ice can not be measured with a sensor as the latter would introduce a heat source to the porous ice and commercial infrared radiometers are usually not sensitive to surface temperatures below 170 k @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the effective surface temperature during sputtering experiments must have been close to the temperature measured on the sample holder for the following reason : the saturation vapour pressure for water frost at 153 k is @xmath17 mbar @xcite .",
    "the chamber pressure reached this level after 20 hours and the measured temperature was 143 k. we did not observe sublimation of the ice in the sample holder during 8.5 hours at these conditions",
    ". the true surface temperature of the ice therefore must have matched the measured temperature of the sample holder to better than 10 k.    due to surface charging , an ion beam that is initially directed at the centre of the ice is deflected sideways until it hits the copper ring .",
    "we either waited for the ice in the sample holder to discharge on its own or we switched on the electron gun to neutralize the charged surface .",
    "we continuously monitored the temperature sensors , the chamber pressure , and the current on the faraday cup above the ice . from the timeseries of the current we derived the charging and discharging timescales of the ice sample at different temperatures .",
    "two different pressure gauges at different places were used to measure the chamber pressure .",
    "pressure gauge 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] is a stabil - ion pressure gauge measuring at an accuracy of 10% and at a time resolution of 1 s , whereas pressure gauge 2 is a less precise baffled cold cathode gauge .",
    "sputtering of the water ice leads to a pressure rise in the vacuum chamber . to detect the small pressure increase due to ion sputtering ,",
    "only the stabil - ion pressure gauge was found to be precise enough .",
    "the pressure rise due to electron irradiation could be detected by both pressure gauges because the electron flux was orders of magnitude higher than the ion flux .     between the ice sample and the ion beam during the present study .",
    "in addition , a quadrupole mass spectrometer and an electron gun are mounted in the chamber roof 80 cm above the ice sample.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "since water ice is an excellent insulator , irradiation with positively charged ions will cause a positive surface charge in spite of the added nacl salt .",
    "if the electric field created by the implanted ions on the ice surface is homogeneous , the ice in the sample holder can be considered a parallel plate capacitor and the charging time @xmath18 calculates to @xmath19 in the above equation , @xmath20 is the ion current , @xmath21 f m@xmath22 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath23 is the relative permittivity of cold porous ice , @xmath24 = 0.009 m is the thickness of the ice layer , and @xmath25 = @xmath26 = 0.0013 m@xmath27 is the ice surface area inside the sample holder . upon irradiation with ions , the ice surface will charge up to an average surface potential @xmath28 that will deflect any additional ion onto the copper ring around the ice .",
    "if we again use the parallel plate capacitor as a model , this surface potential @xmath28 is related to the acceleration voltage of the ions @xmath29 via @xmath30 with @xmath31 the incidence angle between the ion beam and the ice plane .",
    "the other unknown in equation [ eq : fullycharged ] is @xmath23 . in this study",
    ", we will only consider the real part of @xmath23 , since its imaginary part is orders of magnitude lower @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopted the value of @xmath32 from @xcite for compact water ice .",
    "a similar value of @xmath33 is recommended by @xcite for ordinary water ice ( ih ) below @xmath34 k. the permittivity of water ice hardly varies with temperature for the range of 90 to 140 k considered in our study @xcite .",
    "the density of our ice samples closely resembles dry snow .",
    "we will therefore rely on @xcite who measured @xmath35 at microwave frequencies for dry snow with a density of 300 kg m@xmath14 .",
    "this agrees with the value given by @xcite for pure porous water ice with 300 kg m@xmath14 bulk density .",
    "equations  [ eq : fullycharged ] and  [ eq : effective_potential ] then yield @xmath36 s and a surface potential of @xmath37 kv for an ion beam with @xmath38 na and an energy @xmath39 kev .",
    "@xcite directly measured the surface potential of amorphous water ice films with a kelvin probe .",
    "they vapour deposited ice films with hundreds to thousands of nm thickness onto the tip of a microbalance cooled to temperatures between 20 k and 160 k. they found that the surface potential increased asymptotically to an equilibrium during irradiation with an ar@xmath8 beam .",
    "the timescale to charge the ice surface was hundreds of seconds .",
    "the formulae describing the charging of the ice derived by @xcite can not be directly applied to our experiments because of the different types of samples and the completely different dimensions . in particular",
    ", the ice surface potential derived by @xcite contains the distance between the trapped charges , i.e. , ionization depth , and the metal substrate underneath the ice .",
    "the formula describes well the charging of ice layers whose thickness has the same order of magnitude as the ionization depth ( 200 nm for 100 kev ar@xmath8 ) . in our case , however , this distance would be on the order of 0.9 cm and the asymptotic potential would be much larger than the corresponding energy of the ions . in reality , the surface potential will increase to the fraction of the ion acceleration voltage sufficient to deflect subsequent ions away from the ice onto the surrounding metal surfaces .    when the ion bombardment is stopped , the surface discharges in the most simple case with a decay constant @xmath40 , @xmath41 if the ice surface is interpreted again as a parallel plate capacitor ( see eq .  [ eq : fullycharged ] ) , the observed time constant for discharging is related to the static conductivity @xmath42 of the porous ice via @xmath43    @xcite performed a meta - study of previous conductivity measurements for ordinary water ice ( ih ) .",
    "the conductivity depends on temperature , @xmath44 , with the activation energy @xmath45 ranging from 0 to 0.7 ev .",
    "the value is dominated by the chemical impurities ( cl@xmath46 concentrations for instance ) inside the ice ; the more pure the ice , the larger @xmath45 and the smaller @xmath42 . because these impurities are hard to quantify and control , the static conductivity of water ice varies by orders of magnitude ( @xmath47 to @xmath48 s m@xmath22 at @xmath49 k for single crystals ) between different studies @xcite .",
    "likewise , @xcite report @xmath50 to @xmath48 s m@xmath22 for meteoric ice cores from antarctica and greenland for temperatures between 210 and 220 k.    @xcite created amorphous water ice films of 1000 to 3000 monolayers ( corresponding to 300 to 900 nm thickness ) on a microbalance and verified that the ice did not charge up when the ion penetration depth reached the ice layer thickness , i.e. , the energetic ions traversed the ice and hit the gold substrate of the microbalance underneath the ice . for ice films thick enough to charge up , the authors found that the discharging followed an exponential decrease with two different decay constants , representing deep and shallow charges in the ice . the half - life of the shallow charges ( @xmath51 s ) was independent of ice temperature , but the much longer half - life of the deep charges decreased with temperature .",
    "@xcite studied the surface potential and proton transport in similar water ice films and found a constant permittivity for the ice between 30 and 95 k. in some cases @xcite also observed a dielectric breakdown once the surface voltage exceeded hundreds of volt .",
    "we do not expect this phenomenon for our experiments because our ice sample is 10,000 times thicker .",
    "such breakdowns may , however , contribute to the strong signals of frost being detached from metal surfaces ( see section [ sec : frost ] ) .      the experiment set - up ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) allows us to assess the sputtering yield from the ion beam hitting the ice surface by monitoring the total pressure in the vacuum chamber .",
    "if we assume that a constant particle source @xmath52 in addition to the residual outgassing rate @xmath53 is activated at time @xmath54 and turned off again at time @xmath55 we expect the following evolution of the chamber pressure @xmath56 : @xmath57 @xmath58 with @xmath59 m@xmath60 the volume of the chamber and antechamber in fig .",

    "it serves as a summary of previous sputtering experiments with compact water ice films . for ion energies below 1 kev",
    ", the sputtering yield of ions in water ice can be described by a cascade of elastic collisions , whereas at higher ion energies the so - called electronic sputtering dominates .",

    "the condition is that the ice sample is microscopically smooth .",
    "@xcite studied graphite surfaces of varying roughness on a @xmath13 m scale and found that the sputtering yield increased only by a factor of 2.5 when the ion incidence angle increased from 0@xmath83 to 80@xmath83 . for a smooth graphite surface",

    "we first describe the measured charging and discharging time scales for the ice before proceeding to our first results on the ion and electron sputtering .      when the ion beam was directed at the centre of the ice sample , the ion current measured on the copper ring initially dropped to zero .",
    "after a few seconds , depending on the temperature of the ice , the ion current increased to reach a stable value of 80% to 90% of the ion current measured when the beam was directed at the copper ring .",
    "this indicated that most ions were deflected by the surface potential off their original line of flight onto the copper ring .",

    ", we used a completely defocused electron beam to ensure surface neutralization .",
    "contrary to ion irradiation , the sputtering caused by electrons does not choke itself off because of the secondary electrons emitted from the surface . for electron energies between roughly 50 ev and 10 kev the sputtering yield of secondary electrons is larger than 1.0 @xcite , thus more electrons will leave the ice than impacting the ice and newly arriving electrons will not be deflected off the surface .",
    "the ( positive ) surface potential due to electron irradiation will not exceed a few volt because secondary electrons have energies around a few ev almost independent of the energy of the impactors @xcite .",
    "this remaining potential is irrelevant for a subsequent sputtering experiment with kev - energy ions .",

    "the surface charging must be taken into account for an unbiased ion sputtering experiment .",
    "when the ice surface is charged the majority of the ions will not hit the ice sample but rather the metal surfaces and frost around the sample . to measure ion sputtering we directed the ion beam at the ice until the surface potential had reached an equilibrium , discharged the ice during one minute with electrons and repeated the measurement .",
    "this way we avoided waiting times of one hour after each experiment ( see table [ tab : discharging ] ) .    for the cold ice ( @xmath101 k ) , the charging timescale was too short and the sputtering yield was too low to observe a rise of the chamber pressure significantly higher than the precision of the pressure gauge for all ion energies .",

    "higher ice temperatures would result in a higher sputtering yield , but to simulate the icy moons of jupiter , temperatures between 80 k and 150 k are mandatory ( see section [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "in future experiments we will combine our set - up with a cooled microbalance opposite the ice sample to collect sputtered material and thus to enlarge our measurement range .",
    "addition of a microbalance will also allow us to directly compare our results to previous ice sputtering experiments with thin water ice layers on a microbalance @xcite .",
    "we emphasize the importance of studying and monitoring surface charging of ice during any ion sputtering experiment .",
    "figure  [ fig : p(t)_warmice_10_kev ] demonstrated the danger of mis - interpreting strong signals of detached frost as the regular ice sputtering signal .",
    "this became more obvious when we directed the ion beam from the beginning at the copper ring or other frost covered metal surfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig : p(t)_frost ] shows the chamber pressure for five of those cases , the ion beam starts hitting the frost covered metal surfaces at the time @xmath108 .",
    "the pressure spikes appear within the first few seconds afterwards and may be up to 1000 times stronger than the nominal sputtering signal if the frost on the cooling plate is targeted .",
    "the frost signal from the copper ring is much weaker ( red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : p(t)_frost ] ) but still stronger than the sputtering signal from the ice sample .",
    "the pressure fluctuates rapidly , but the spikes tend to become weaker during ion bombardment and if the same experiment is repeated for the same patch of frost on metal .",
    "our interpretation is that entire flakes of frost are detached from the metal surfaces by electrostatic repulsion .",
    "the quadrupole mass spectrometer shows that the pressure rise during such incidences is solely due to h@xmath0o molecules .",
    "the process sets in too fast and shows too large variations to be attributed to the ion beam warming up the frost .",
    "this type of intense frost sputtering does not apply to the surfaces of icy moons because there is no conducting metal surface directly underneath the top frost layer .",
    "given these observations , we consider a thick ice layer crucial for sputtering experiments to electrically decouple the ion charges from the metal surfaces underneath .",
    "ions hitting thin irregular frost on various metal surfaces .",
    "orange : frost on the outer bottom of the sample holder ( @xmath109 k ) , green , cyan , and blue : frost on the cooling plate ( @xmath110 k ) , red : thin frost on the copper ring above the ice sample ( @xmath111 k ) .",
    "the first black vertical line denotes the onset of sputtering , the second line denotes the moment when the ion beam is blocked.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "we have presented first experimental studies of ion sputtering in thick and porous water ice representative for the surface of icy moons .",
    "we have shown that the surface charging of the ice must be monitored during the experiment to correctly interpret the observed sputtering yield .",
    "the apparent signal obtained when a thin or irregular frost layer is detached from a metal surface due to electrostatic repulsion may be orders of magnitude larger than the actual sputtering rate of water ice .",
    "electric conductivity of porous water ice regolith at temperatures close to 100 k is very low , on the order of @xmath96 s m@xmath22 , even if nacl is present .    since a thick and porous ice layer can not be attached to the tip of a microbalance we resorted in these first experiments to monitoring the rise and fall of the chamber pressure during sputtering experiments .",
    "this pressure rise method leads to sputtering yields similar to previous laboratory experiments performed with thin water ice films sputtered off a microbalance .",
    "our results are thus consistent with the notion that sputtering from porous regolith ice is similar to compact monolayers of water ice .",
    "but more experiments at various energies , incidence angles , and different ion species are required to make a stronger statement . the residual pressure in the chamber and the measurement precision prevent us from measuring sputter yields less than 100 .",
    "as a result , we only obtain upper limits for the sputtering yield at energies below 10 kev .",
    "our experiments have , with the limitations stated above , three main implications for surface and exosphere models of the galilean moons .",
    "so far , the sputtering yields implemented in exosphere models need not be changed .",
    "however , plasma models must take into account that the electric conductivity of the surface is very low . as a consequence",
    ", electron irradiation may have to be included explicitly in exosphere models .",
