    "one of the main goals of thermodynamics has been to study heat engines and thermodynamic processes , dating back to the now famous work of sardi carnot in 1824 @xcite . with the advent of nano physics and the control of quantum systems down to single atoms",
    "a better understanding of thermodynamics on the basis of quantum mechanics is necessary .    since the first attempts to analyze thermodynamic machines on the quantum level @xcite",
    "considerable progress has been made in the last decades .",
    "different kinds of models like machines built of harmonic oscillators , of uncoupled spins , particles in a potential or different three level systems have been studied @xcite .",
    "also the question about the violation of the second law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime has come up now and then . for a heat engine this would lead to an efficiency larger than the carnot efficiency .",
    "all attempts to do so have failed and could be resolved , e.g. , with the help of maxwell s demon @xcite .    two level systems ( tls ) like spins or qubits are the essential ingredients for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "much effort has been directed towards control of small clusters and chains of qubits in quantum optical systems @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and solid state systems @xcite .",
    "a serious problem in any such realization is the interaction of the respective quantum network with its environment .    in the present work we study a model consisting of three tls arranged in a chain in contact with two baths of different temperatures as studied for transport scenarios , e.g. , in @xcite . here",
    "an energy gradient on the system and an incoherent driving of the tls in the middle let this system act as a thermodynamic machine . for possible experiments",
    "the set up may require more tls s .    under special conditions",
    "the carnot efficiency may be reached by a tls heat engine but can never go beyond : if the carnot efficiency is reached the machine flips its function , e.g. , from a heat pump to a heat engine .",
    "we start with a discussion of the concept of work and heat .",
    "this is done by considering the change of the energy expection value of a quantum system . with the help of the gibbs relation heat",
    "can be associated with the change of occupation numbers of a quantum system whereas work is the change of the spectrum .",
    "we then introduce our thermodynamic machine consisting of three tls s @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic properties can be imparted on this system by an appropriate embedding into a larger quantum environment @xcite , without the need of any thermal bath . in the present context , though , it is much simpler to settle for the open system approach based on a quantum master equation ( qme ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level2 ] the used qme will be introduced .",
    "our numerical results are detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : level4 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level5 ] we compare the numerical investigation with an ideal tls machine where ideal process steps are assumed .",
    "the obtained result is rather general and valid for any kind of tls machines .",
    "to describe thermodynamic processes and machines one first has to define the pertinent variables heat , work , temperature and entropy for the system under consideration .",
    "starting from the energy expectation value @xmath2 for a quantum system @xmath3 with discrete spectrum ( @xmath4 is the density operator ) and considering the temporal change of @xmath5 @xmath6 change of work @xmath7 can be associated with the first term of ( [ eq5 ] ) where only the spectrum changes @xmath8 @xmath9 is the change per time of the @xmath10-th eigenvalue and @xmath11 is the corresponding occupation probability .",
    "the change of heat @xmath12 is then the second part of ( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath13 equation ( [ eq5 ] ) thus boils down to the famous gibbs relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy change of the system . for cyclic processes",
    "work @xmath16 and heat @xmath17 can also be calculated with the help of the @xmath18-diagram . for a closed path in the @xmath18-plane @xmath19 and",
    "thus @xmath20 while connected with bath @xmath21 @xmath22 can alternatively be calculated from the respective heat current @xmath23 over one cycle of duration @xmath24 @xmath25 typically there are two baths @xmath26 and thus two contributions ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) @xmath27      the temperature of a system can be defined if the state in the energy eigenbasis is canonical . for a tls @xmath28",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath29 with occupation probability @xmath30 of the energy level @xmath31 .",
    "due to the fact that all coherences will be damped out by the bath it is always possible to get a local temperature for a single tls .",
    "the von - neumann - entropy @xmath32 can then be taken as the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "the efficiency of a heat pump is defined by the ratio of the heat @xmath33 pumped per cycle to the hot reservoir and the work applied @xmath34 which reduces for the carnot heat pump to @xmath35 for the heat engine the efficiency is @xmath36 which in the carnot case leads to @xmath37",
    "the model under investigation is an inhomogeneous spin chain with nearest neighbor coupling of heisenberg type described by the hamiltonian @xmath38 the @xmath39 s are the pauli - operators of the @xmath28th spin .",
    "@xmath40 is the coupling strength which is chosen to be small compared to the local zeeman splitting @xmath41 , @xmath42 . because @xmath43 we call the spin chain inhomogeneous .",
    "we will need at least three spins in order to have this system work as a thermodynamic pump or machine .",
    "the spin chain is brought in contact locally with two baths at different temperatures as depicted in fig .",
    "the detuning between spin 1 and spin 3 is @xmath44 .",
    "there are different ways to describe the thermal behavior of quantum systems coupled to environments .",
    "examples are the path integral method @xcite or schemes based on the complete schrdinger dynamics of the small system embedded into a larger quantum environment @xcite . because it is much simpler for the present context we settle for a master equation approach .",
    "such an approach has been widely applied to describe system bath models @xcite .    to derive the master equation for our model",

    "however , with both baths in place the spin chain might be viewed as a molecular bridge generating a stationary leakage current @xmath82 . here",
    "the heat current @xmath23 between the 3-spin - system and the bath @xmath21 can be defined by the energy dissipated via bath @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath83 in the following a current out of bath @xmath21 into the machine will be defined as positive .",
    "first we note that the heat current through a spin chain depends on the local zeeman splittings within the system . to analyze the heat current we solve ( [ eq2 ] ) and calculate the stationary state of the system @xmath84 .",
    "with this solution and with the help of ( [ eq3 ] ) we can then calculate the currents @xmath23 for each bath .",
    "we consider a system with @xmath85 .",
    "both heat currents ( [ eq3 ] ) as function of @xmath86 are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath87 is positive and the relation @xmath88 is fullfilled . if @xmath89 ( the homogeneous case ) the heat currents reach their maximum . by detuning the local energy splitting",
    "it is thus possible to uncouple the respective bath from the rest of the system .",
    "this resonance effect will now be used to build out of three spins a quantum thermodynamic machine .",
    "the above situation changes when the energy splitting of spin 2 is chosen to be time - dependent , i.e. , @xmath90 different energy splittings of the boundary spins , e.g. , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are used to install left / right - selective resonance effects .",
    "the parameters of ( [ eq13 ] ) are chosen as @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the detuning @xmath95 . to enable the bath to damp the system @xmath96",
    "must be fullfilled .    for solving ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "we have used a four step runge - kutta - algorithm . at each time",
    "step the bath correlation function is calculated explicitly .",
    "we choose the following parameters for our numerical results : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath77 is varied , unless stated otherwise . both coupling parameters @xmath40 and @xmath52",
    "are chosen to stay in the weak coupling limit .",
    "now when spin 2 is driven periodically as in ( [ eq13 ] ) , we can distinguish four different steps :    1 .",
    "spin 2 ( the `` working gas '' ) is in resonance with spin 3 [ @xmath101 and thus couples with bath @xmath102 at temperature @xmath78 .",
    "because of this energy resonance the current @xmath103 via spin 3 will be large , whereas the current @xmath87 via spin 2 will be negligible .",
    "the occupation probabilities of spin 2 and 3 approach each other and so do the respective local temperatures .",
    "quasi - adiabatic step : spin 2 is out of resonance with spin 3 [ @xmath104 , now @xmath103 is suppressed while @xmath87 nearly stays unchanged .",
    "the occupation probability of spin 2 does not change significantly and there is almost no change in the entropy @xmath105 .",
    "spin 2 is in resonance with spin 1 [ @xmath106 and by that in contact with bath @xmath107 at temperature @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath87 is large whereas @xmath103 is very small .",
    "the local temperatures of spin 1 and 2 nearly equal each other .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the heat currents @xmath23 of both baths over one period with the bath temperatures @xmath108 and @xmath100 . as can be seen the resonance effect decouples spin 2 from the bath if its energy splitting is different from the boundary or filter spins .",
    "this decoupling is never perfect , though . as a consequence",
    "there is a leakage current @xmath109 which will be discussed in more detail later on .",
    "that the studied system indeed works as a heat pump can be seen from the @xmath110-diagram of spin 2 in fig .",
    "the local entropy @xmath105 of spin 2 is given by ( [ eq12 ] ) and the local temperature @xmath111 by ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "the four different steps as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : level4b1 ] are shown as well as the direction of circulation .    to determine the efficiency of this heat pump one",
    "needs to know the quantity of heat @xmath33 pumped to the hot bath and the used work @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath33 can be calculated by integrating the heat current @xmath87 over one period [ cf .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) ] .    the exchanged work @xmath16 is given by the area enclosed in the @xmath110-plane according to ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "we find that indeed @xmath112 in all cases and by that confirm the use of @xmath111 and @xmath105 as effective thermodynamic variables .",
    "in contrast to the carnot model our machine is working in finite time .",
    "if driven too fast the bath is not able to damp the system and if driven too slow ( quasi - stationary ) the system would have reached its momentary steady state transport configuration ( i.e. @xmath113 ) .",
    "the @xmath110-area then vanishes as depicted in fig .",
    "this is caused by the leakage current .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the carnot efficiency for the heat pump @xmath114 , for the machine @xmath115 and the respective efficiencies for our quantum heat pump @xmath116 [ according to ( [ eq14 ] ) ] and machine @xmath117 [ according to ( [ eq15a ] ) ] as a function of the temperature difference @xmath118 .",
    "we point out the following interesting findings :    * the efficiency curve of the quantum heat pump or machine is always below the respective carnot efficiency .",
    "as expected , the 2nd law is never violated . * for @xmath119 @xmath116 does neither diverge nor go to zero .",
    "this means that the machine can start out of equilibrium and begin to cool a reservoir .",
    "* at a specific temperature difference @xmath0 , here @xmath120 , the heat pump switches to operate as a heat engine .",
    "to illustrate this fact fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the area in the @xmath110-plane for @xmath121 .",
    "as depicted , the direction of circulation has reversed .    to make the last point more plausible fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the work @xmath16 , the heat @xmath122 and @xmath123 as function of @xmath0 .",
    "while @xmath0 is increasing , @xmath33 and @xmath124 are decreasing as well as @xmath16 until first @xmath124 changes its sign , then @xmath122 and last @xmath16 .",
    "at the point where @xmath125 ( for @xmath126 ) only the leakage current @xmath109 is flowing from the hot bath to the cold one . beyond this @xmath127",
    "the system starts to work as an engine .",
    "to understand the above numerical results we compare them to the maximal reachable heat and work which could be pumped or extracted by a tls quantum machine .",
    "all process steps will be taken to be ideal steps . by ideal we mean that we have total control of each process step .",
    "then no leakage current will disturb the system and the heat exchange at bath contact will be without loss .",
    "in addition we assume a machine which only works during the adiabatic steps .",
    "heat will be exchanged only if the machine is in contact with a bath .",
    "this can be compared with the otto - cycle @xcite .",
    "we start with spin  2 in contact with spin  3 and thus with cold bath .",
    "the state of spin  2 after this contact is a canonical one of the form @xmath128 @xmath129 is the partition function and we have assumed that the energy of the ground state is @xmath130 and the excited state @xmath131 because both spins are in resonance .    after this equilibration with the cold bath at @xmath78 the spin  2 is driven until its local energy splitting is equal to spin  1 ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) .",
    "the work for this step can be calculated with ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "this step is adiabatic as @xmath134 does not change .",

    "the work @xmath141 for this step is given by @xmath142 finally the heat @xmath143",
    "@xmath144    \\label{eq54}\\ ] ] will be exchanged with the cold bath via spin  3 .",
    "the total work @xmath145 is given by @xmath146 the gibbs - relation @xmath147 can easily be verified .    with the help ( [ eq51 ] ) - ( [ eq54b ] )",
    "it is now possible to calculated the efficiency of this ideal machine . for the heat pump we get @xmath148 for the machine @xmath149",
    "this result is similar to that obtained by kieu @xcite and is the maximum a tls can reach .",
    "here we want to compare the efficiency of the ideal pump @xmath150 and engine @xmath151 with the respective carnot efficiencies for the parameters used for our numerical results .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the carnot efficiencies as well as the one from ( [ eq55 ] ) and ( [ eq56 ] ) .",
    "@xmath152 is always below @xmath153 until it reaches a maximal temperature difference @xmath127 ( with @xmath154 and @xmath92 we get @xmath155 ) .",
    "at this temperature the heat pump is working lossless and no heat can be pumped .",
    "just like the quasi - stationary carnot heat pump this pump has zero power . only in this particular case @xmath156 . by further increasing the temperature @xmath77",
    "the heat pump starts working as a heat engine .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] illustrates this behavior where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are depicted as function of @xmath0 . at @xmath127",
    "no heat @xmath137 is pumped and therefore no work used or no heat exhausted to do work .",
    "this is qualitatively the same behavior as our model shows in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and fig .",
    "two differences can be seen .",
    "first the critical temperature in our numerical result deviates from the theoretical expected one . from the numerics we get @xmath159 .",
    "second the inset in fig",
    ".  [ fig6 ] shows that @xmath124 changes its sign before @xmath33 does .",
    "the reason for both effects is due to the leakage current as will be explained below .    for a given bath temperature ( like in our example @xmath100 ) it is possible by changing the energy splittings of @xmath160 and/or @xmath161 to influence @xmath127 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] also a different efficiency @xmath162 is depicted .",
    "@xmath162 can be realized by increasing @xmath160 so that @xmath127 will be decreased to @xmath163 .",
    "the efficiency of an ideal two level quantum machine is independent of @xmath0 except at @xmath164 , where it jumps between its heat pump and its heat engine value .",
    "the efficiency obtained from the numerical simulation deviates somewhat from this expected behavior . for the heat pump the efficiency of our model",
    "is even larger than the ideal one ( see fig .  [ fig10 ] ) . to understand this effect",
    "we analyze the leakage current from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "first we assume that the leakage current causes the gas spin  2 to approach a thermal state which is not in accordance with the bath temperature . in this case @xmath33 and @xmath124 will be decreased .",
    "this effect is responsible for the vanishing of @xmath165 before reaching @xmath127 .",
    "but it can not explain why the efficiency of @xmath116 is sometimes larger than @xmath150 .",
    "taking into account that also less work is performed due to the leakage current it is possible to find a larger efficiency .",
    "this can be interpreted in that the gas spin  2 does not `` see '' the full energy splitting @xmath160 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] our phenomenological model fits the numerical data quite good .    for the efficiency of the heat engine @xmath117 it",
    "can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that it is always worse than the ideal engine @xmath166 .",
    "we have studied a driven 3-spin system coupled to two split heat baths .",
    "we have shown that such small quantum networks may be used not only as quantum information processors but also as quantum thermodynamic machines .",
    "for the latter proposal we would primarily exploit the ( time - dependent ) deformation of discrete spectra and associated resonance transfer .    while interesting functionality appears already for n = 3 spins , also larger spin networks subject to such very limited control could be envisaged without losing inherent stability : eventually this stability is dictated by the increase of entropy , i.e. , by the second law of thermodynamics .    for a thermodynamic tls machine working with ideal heat transport and adiabatic steps",
    "we have derived an ideal efficiency .",
    "this efficiency is independent of the bath temperatures . by tuning the energy splitting of the tls",
    "the quantum thermodynamic machine can be used as a heat pump or heat engine .",
    "the carnot efficiency will only be reached when a tls machine is working losslessly .",
    "taking dissipation into account it is possible to understand the leakage current present in our numerics from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "surprisingly a leakage current could even increase the efficiency of a heat pump whereas for a heat engine it only decreases the efficiency .",
    "there are a number of different options for implementations @xcite and also various possibilities to introduce the time - dependent control . for simplicity",
    "we have restricted ourselves here to external driving ; alternatively one might look for autonomous system designs @xcite , e.g. , by using a mechanical oscillator ( cantilever ) @xcite .",
    "artificial autonomous nanomotors powered by visible light have recently been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .    from a fundamental point of view",
    "several interesting questions remain : what is the status of thermodynamic variables for such quantum systems ? to what extent are these measurable in the nano - domain - without being operators ? and if measured , how would the measurement result fluctuate @xcite ?    as noted already , a two - level system diagonal in its local energy basis can always be described as canonical with some temperature @xmath167 , i.e. , there is conceptionally no space for nonequilibrium here .",
    "it is remarkable that for periodic operation work can then be associated with the area defined by the closed path in the effective entropy - temperature plane for the driven spin , as in macroscopic models .",
    "this may challenge the subjective ignorance interpretation of none - pure states as classical mixtures , i.e. , assuming the individual spin to be either up or down at any time .",
    "if the thermal state was taken to result from quantum entanglement with the environment @xcite , this classical picture would no longer be needed ; those concepts from quantum information seem to be more appropriate here ."
