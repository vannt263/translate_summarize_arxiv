    "over a period of hundred years , einstein s general relativity(gr ) has been successful in explaining a lot of astrophysical as well as cosmological phenomena .",
    "recently , the discovery of gravitational waves by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) experiments has greatly supported the predictions of gr @xcite .",
    "however , gr fails to explain the phenomenon of late time cosmic speed up . this failure has triggered to modify gr in two possible ways : firstly , by incorporating an exotic dark energy form in the matter side of the field equations in gr to provide extra repulsive pressure and secondly , by modifying the geometry part of the field equation i.e modifying the einstein - hilbert action through some functional forms of ricci scalar , @xmath1 or by putting some matter field into it .",
    "these modified gravity models have attracted a lot of research attention in the last decade because of their success in explaining many issues in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "so far , our knowledge on dark energy is very poor .",
    "dark energy is believed to dominate the mass - energy budget of the universe , it violates the strong energy conditions and it can cluster at largest accessible scale . besides the conventional choice of the cosmological constant , a good number of dark energy candidates such as quintessence , k - essence , phantom field , tachyons , ghost dark energy , ricci dark energy have been proposed in recent years to handle the issue of late time cosmic acceleration . in some recent works , there also have been attempts to unify the dark energy and dark matter under a single platform of unified dark fluid @xcite . still uncertainty persists in getting the exact nature and origin of dark energy .",
    "+ modified gravity models do not require dark energy to explain late time cosmic acceleration rather this aspect is taken care of by modifying the geometry . in the present work ,",
    "we have tried to understand the dynamics of an accelerating universe in the back drop of a modified gravity model . in the modified model",
    ", the einstein - hilbert action contains a functional @xmath0 in place of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "this theory of gravity has attracted a lot of research interest in recent times @xcite .",
    "jamil et al . have reconstructed some cosmological models in this theory of gravity using the functional form @xmath3 @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "sharif and zubair investigated perfect fluid distribution and mass less scalar field for bianchi type - i universe @xcite .",
    "mohanta @xcite , mishra and sahoo @xcite , shamir @xcite , ahmed and pradhan @xcite have studied spatially homogeneous bianchi type cosmological models with perfect fluid as source of matter in @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "mishra et al . have studied the dynamics of an anisotropic bianchi @xmath4 universe in @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "irregularity energy density factor in @xmath0 theory that disturbs the stability of homogeneous universe has been studied by yousaf et al.@xcite . in another work ,",
    "they have explored the evolutionary behaviour of compact objects @xcite .",
    "recently , in this framework , sahoo and his collaborators have reconstructed some @xmath0 cosmological models for anisotropic universes @xcite .    in our earlier work @xcite , we have obtained accelerating models in the framework of @xmath0 theory of gravity for an anisotropic bianchi type iii ( biii ) universe . in that paper",
    ", we could able to integrate the modified gravity field equations in a novel method with the assumption of a power law functional for a directional scale factor .",
    "the present investigation is an extension of the previous work with a linear directional scale factor leading to the generation of a logarithmic scale factor .",
    "also we have explored the cosmic transit redshift to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the universe is believed to have undergone a transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating phase .",
    "the redshift at which this transition occurred is termed here as the cosmic transit redshift .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic formalism of @xmath0 gravity for a perfect fluid distribution is presented in sect-2 .",
    "the exact solutions of the field equations are derived for an anisotropic bianchi type -iii universe in sect-3 . here ,",
    "we have considered two different functional forms for @xmath0 .",
    "the two models behave alike because of the linear nature of the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the model parameters appearing in the scale factor is constrained from the cosmic transit redshift .",
    "the kinematic features of the models are discussed in sect-4 .",
    "the dynamics of the anisotropic universe for the two different functional forms of @xmath0 with two possible cosmic transit redshift is assessed through the calculation of the effective equation of state parameter in sect-5 .",
    "the conclusions of the present work are presented at last in sect-6 .",
    "the field equations of @xmath0 gravity as has been proposed by harko et al .",
    "@xcite and has been widely used by others are derived from the action @xmath7 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of ricci scalar @xmath1 and the trace @xmath8 of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 of the matter source .",
    "@xmath10 is the usual matter lagrangian density . in the present work ,",
    "we have considered the matter lagrangian density as @xmath11 . here , we consider the system of units where @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity field equations are obtained from the action @xmath13 as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the partial differentiation of the respective functional with respect to their arguments .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 being the covariant derivative .",
    "the stress energy tensor for a cosmic fluid with pressure @xmath21 and energy density @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the four velocity vector in co - moving coordinate system .",
    "it is evident from eq . that the physical nature of the matter field decides the behaviour of the field equations of @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "therefore different choice of the matter source will therefore lead to different cosmological models in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "in other words , one can construct viable cosmological models with different choices of the functional @xmath0 . however , harko et al .",
    "@xcite have constructed three possible models by considering the functional @xmath0 to be either of @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath6 are some arbitrary functions of @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "these functions may be chosen arbitrarily and the obtained results may then be matched with observations concerning late time acceleration or can be reconstructed from some plausible physical basis such as energy conditions and cosmic thermodynamics .",
    "following our earlier work @xcite , we have considered here two models : @xmath25 with @xmath29 and @xmath26 with linear functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    the field equations for the two specific choices respectively become @xmath32 and @xmath33 it is obvious that , because of the presence of linear functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the above two specific choices of the functional @xmath0 will behave alike and overlap for the specific choices of the model parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in view of this , we expect similar dynamics of the universe in both the models @xcite .",
    "the field equations in the modified gravity theory for the two specific choices of the functional @xmath0 in the backdrop of an anisotropic and spatially homogeneous universe modelled through a bianchi type iii metric    @xmath36    can be explicitly written as    @xmath37    here , the directional scale factors @xmath38 and @xmath39 are considered as functions of cosmic time @xmath40 only and the exponent @xmath41 is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants and are decided from the choice of the functional @xmath0 . in the above field equations , an overhead dot denotes ordinary derivative with respect to @xmath40 . for the first case with @xmath44 we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 whereas for the second case with the choice @xmath47 we can have @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "here we have used the fact that the trace of the energy momentum tensor for our model is @xmath50 .",
    "incorporation of eq . into the field equations",
    "eqs.(6)-(9 ) yields    @xmath51    from eqs .",
    "and we get @xmath52 it is obvious that eq . contains two unknowns @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath39 and an additional assumed condition is required to get a physically viable cosmological model . in a recent work @xcite , a power law form for @xmath39",
    "was assumed i.e. @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a positive constant i.e. @xmath56 . in that work , accelerating cosmological models have been constructed for @xmath57 . in the present work ,",
    "we have explored the interesting case with @xmath58 which provides us a logarithmic scale factor . following the procedure of integration as adopted in ref.@xcite with the choice of @xmath59 ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath60    the average scale factor for this model becomes @xmath61 consequently , the deceleration parameter @xmath62 is obtained as @xmath63 one should note that , the scale factor has two factors : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "one dominates at the early phase and the other dominates at the late phase of cosmic evolution .",
    "however , the scale factor vanishes at @xmath66 . before this epoch",
    ", the volume scale factor becomes negative . in order to get positive volume factor",
    ", we wish to shift the time scale so that the time starts from @xmath66 , the point of time when the scale factor and the volume scale factor are zero .",
    "the only unknown parameter that affects the volume scale factor is the exponent @xmath41 in the metric . we have shown the behaviour of the scale factor as function of cosmic time for different representative values of @xmath41 in figure 1 .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that , with the increase in @xmath41 , the slope of the scale factor increases . in general , the deceleration parameter , @xmath67 does not depend on the value of the exponent @xmath41 .",
    "however , in figure 2 , we have shown the deceleration parameter as function of the redshift @xmath68 for two values of @xmath41 .",
    "here we have assumed the scale factor at the present epoch to be @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the deceleration parameter evolves with cosmic time from early deceleration to late time acceleration .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath41 have been constrained from the behaviour of @xmath67 as a function of redshift so that , the deceleration to acceleration transition occurs at either at @xmath70 or at @xmath71 .",
    "these two values of transition redshift have been chosen from recent predictions from a host of observational data @xcite .",
    "corresponding to these values of transition redshift , @xmath41 is constrained to assume the values @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "this has been clearly reflected in fig.2 .",
    "the interesting feature of the model is that , the choice of the functional @xmath0 does not affect the scale factor and the deceleration parameter .",
    "while the scale factor depends on the exponent @xmath41 , the deceleration parameter is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "one can also infer that , we may get similar scale factor in gr in the backdrop of an anisotropic biii universe .",
    "however , a modified einstein - hilbert action affects the dynamics of the universe that can be decided through the effective dark energy equation of state .     which has been constrained from two different values of cosmic transit redshift.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the scale factor of the model depends on the choice of the exponent @xmath41 and does not depend on the choice of the functional @xmath0 .",
    "consequently the kinematic features of the model for both the choices of the functional @xmath0 , as has been considered in the present work , are the same .    in general , for the anisotropic bianchi",

    "however , the evolution of @xmath97 is governed by the two parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that , different choice of these parameters leads to different model in the modified gravity . in the present work ,",
    "we have considered two specific models of the modified gravity where the functional @xmath0 is either @xmath44 or @xmath98 . in the first case , @xmath99 and @xmath100 whereas in the second choice @xmath48 and @xmath101 . in both the cases ,",
    "the effective dark energy equation of state parameter evolves from a positive value at the beginning to an asymptotic value @xmath102 at late time .",
    "the evolution of @xmath97 , for the first case , is shown as a function of redshift @xmath83 in figure 3 . in the figure , we have shown different plots corresponding to different choices of the parameter @xmath103 .",

    "one can note from the figure that , at any early epoch , the models appears to coincide , however , they follow different evolutionary path with the growth of cosmic time . for @xmath105 ,",

    "this interesting aspect of the theory , called @xmath0 gravity , have been investigated elsewhere . however , in the present work , we have explored the cosmic transit redshift as a constant of nature and constrained the parameters of the model to study the dynamics . in this context , we have considered two functional forms of @xmath0 : @xmath44 and @xmath98 .",
