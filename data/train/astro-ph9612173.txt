    "our understanding of the links between the gas dynamics and the star formation history in barred galaxies has made remarkable progress in the past ten years , thanks to numerous multi - wavelength observations and @xmath3-body simulations with stars , gas and star formation ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ; friedli & benz 1995 ) .",
    "for instance , the suggestion of shlosman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) that the gas fuelling of the central regions is triggered by dissipation once the bar is formed has been confirmed and the efficiency of the process has been quantified ( friedli & benz 1993 ) . however , in order to accrete gas on a scale of a few parsec , another mechanism must be invoked , like a secondary bar or a triaxial bulge ( shlosman et al .",
    "1989 , 1990 ) .",
    "these secondary bars have now been observed in the optical ( wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ) and near infrared ( friedli et al .",
    "1996 ) ranges , and in the co line ( kenney 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "friedli & martinet ( 1993 ) have shown that double bar structures can transport amounts of gas much closer to the galactic center than simple bars .",
    "the gas accretion rate can be very high and may provide a possible mechanism for triggering starbursts .",
    "however , it still remains to be shown that agn or nuclear starbursts can be fuelled by such mechanisms .",
    "indeed , high resolution observations ( _ hubble space telescope _ images , co mappings ) are beginning to reveal complex structures that simulations can not accurately model because of their poor resolution in the innermost region .    in order to shed new light on the relationship between nuclear starbursts and gas dynamics",
    ", we decided to combine the properties of molecular clouds with characteristics of the starbursts rarely used in previous studies .",
    "in particular , the age of the starburst has so far never been used in practice ; it can be now estimated from optical spectroscopy and evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "we selected 29 galaxies ( cf . table  ) from a large sample of starburst galaxies ( contini 1996 ) .",
    "they share the following properties : 1 ) they host a young nuclear starburst ( age ranging from 3 to 12 myr ) and 2 ) they have the largest far infrared fluxes .",
    "the latter criterion was to optimize our chances of detecting co.    all galaxies of the sample are barred galaxies .",
    "this classification comes from the leda database and/or from our ccd images at a resolution of 1.5  ( contini 1996 ) .",
    "most galaxies have morphological peculiarities , either an asymmetric spiral pattern ( mrk 133 , 213 , 353 , 691 , 799 , 1466 and , to a lesser extent , mrk 759 and 1050 ) , several bright hii regions along the bar ( mrk 13 , 281 , 306 , 710 , 712 , 731 , 1341 ) , or a polar ring ( mrk 306 ) .",
    "some galaxies also have a close companion ( mrk 306 , 602 , 691 , 1379 ) .",
    "mrk 2 has a companion 103  away and mrk 617 is a merger .",
    "the only galaxies without marked peculiarities are mrk 52 , 412 , 545 , 575 , 708 , 1088 , 1194 and 1485 .",
    "two galaxies lacked high resolution images ( mrk 1365 and 1379 ) .",
    "the radio observations were obtained at the iram 30 meter radiotelescope on august 20 to 24 , 1995 .",
    "we observed in single sideband at two frequencies simultaneously , co(1@xmath00 ) at 115.3  ghz with the 1.3 mm sis receiver , and co(2@xmath01 ) at 230.5  ghz with the 3 mm ( 230g1 ) sis receiver .",
    "the beamwidth of the 30 meter antenna is 21  and 12 , and the main beam efficiency 0.75 and 0.39 at 115 and 230  ghz respectively .",
    "the observing procedure and data reduction are detailed in contini ( 1996 ) .",
    "we observed 18 galaxies of the sample ; co data for the other 11 galaxies were taken from the literature .",
    "mrk  712 is the only undetected galaxy at 115  ghz ; this is not surprizing , as its far infrared flux turns out to be the lowest of the whole sample .",
    "mrk  412 , which also has a low far infrared flux , was barely detected at 115  ghz .",
    "several galaxies , mrk  13 , 759 , 1050 , 1341 , were ambiguously detected at 230  ghz , mainly because the noise at that frequency was a factor 2 or 3 higher than at 115  ghz .",
    "mrk  213 was probably detected at 230  ghz , but the adopted recession velocity was too low , and , consequently , part of the profile was outside the observing frequency window .",
    "the co(1@xmath00 ) and co(2@xmath01 ) line profiles are displayed in contini ( 1996 ) .",
    "the spectra were smoothed to a final velocity resolution of 10 km  s@xmath2 for both transitions .",
    "one of the main characteristics of the profiles is that they are generally not symmetric ; this can not be attributed to noise , because of the long integration times ( typically between 50 and 330 minutes ) and the good resulting signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "most profiles can be adjusted by two or three gaussians ; this suggests the existence of separate molecular clouds of uneven sizes and/or with distinct velocities .",
    "only six profiles ( those of mrk 13 , 133 , 412 , 1050 , 1379 and 1485 ) are well fitted by one gaussian .",

    "we used these two estimates of the linewidths to check the consistency of our results .",
    "for the galaxies with high signal - to - noise ratio , the uncertainty on the linewidth is equal to the velocity resolution ( 10  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the linewidths of co(1@xmath00 ) and co(2@xmath01 ) profiles at 20 and 50% are given in table  .",
    "as the observing conditions ( e.g. the beamsize ) and the calibration procedures for the 11 galaxies from the literature were in general different from ours , these data are rather heterogeneous and have been used with caution ; they are thus listed separately in table  and plotted with different symbols in fig .  .",
    "the ccd spectra were obtained during several runs at the 1.93 meter telescope of observatoire de haute - provence , with the carelec spectrograph .",
    "we took long - slit spectra at 260 / mm .",
    "we observed standard stars for flux calibration .",
    "the spectra were reduced with midas .",
    "the deblending of the h@xmath4+[nii ] and [ sii]@xmath56716,6731 lines was done by fitting multigaussian profiles , with constraints on the relative positions of the individual lines .",
    "the starburst ages were estimated from the equivalent widths w(h@xmath6 ) and metallicities ( estimated from the oxygen abundance ) measured on our spectra and the evolutionary synthesis models of cervio & mas - hesse ( 1994 , cmh94 ) and leitherer & heckman ( 1995 , lh95 ) .",
    "we used a standard salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with @xmath7 , @xmath8 to 2 m@xmath9 and @xmath10 to 200 m@xmath9 .",
    "w(h@xmath6 ) was corrected for balmer absorption ( assuming w@xmath11(h@xmath6 ) @xmath12 2  ) which is a contamination from the underlying stellar population . the procedure for estimating the starburst ages is fully described in contini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and contini ( 1996 ) .",
    "when several hii regions ( or even a fraction of a giant hii region ) fall inside the beam of the radiotelescope , the age is that of the brightest region in h@xmath4 .",
    "hii regions outside the beam were not taken into account . incidentally ,",
    "the brightest hii regions are all nuclear , except for mrk  13 ( 4.3  from the center ) and mrk  306 ( 7.8  from the center ) .",
    "three hii regions of mrk  306 have similar ( within a factor 2 ) h@xmath4 luminosities .",
    "but the various ages are comparable for both models ( 7.3 to 7.4 myr using cmh94 and 7.0 to 8.5 myr using lh95 ) , so that we adopted a mean value for the age .",
    "the three hii regions of mrk  710 also have similar h@xmath4 luminosities , but the ages range from 4 to 5.5  myr ( cmh94 ) and 6.3 to 8.4  myr ( lh95 ) .",
    "we thus kept three entries in our data for this object .",
    "for mrk  1379 , two hii regions lie near the nucleus with very different ages ( 3.9 , 5.7 using cmh94 ; 4.5 , 8.6 using lh95 ) .",
    "although the ratio of h@xmath4 luminosities is close to 9 , we decided to keep both regions in our subsequent analysis .",
    "a conservative estimate of the error on the age of young starbursts is 1  myr for both models , taking into account the possible uncertainties on the slope of the imf , the contamination by older or younger hii regions on the borderline of the beam , etc . for older starbursts ,",
    "h@xmath6 is weaker and the uncertainty on the age increases , and reaches 2  myr for 10  myr old bursts .",
    "however , there are several galaxies for which the ages differ between cmh94 and lh95 models by more than the sum of the age errors .",
    "_ we thus decided to keep only the objects showing a difference in age less than 2.5  myr_. the final age is thus the mean of the two estimates .",
    "this criterion does not reduce the number of young starbursts displayed in fig .  with respect to those listed in table  .",
    "but fewer old starbursts are displayed , since there the error on the age difference may reach @xmath134  myr .",
    "the co linewidth as a function of starburst age is plotted in fig .  with the data of table  .",
    "when the two linewidths are comparable , we only plot the one at 115  ghz , for the sake of clarity . to correct for projection effects onto the plane of the sky , we divided the observed width by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the inclination of the galaxy taken from the leda database .",
    "for the top diagram we used the",
    "_ mean _ of the two starburst ages determined in the previous section .",
    "we also show separate diagrams for the cmh94 and lh95 models , since they often give significantly different age estimates .",
    "a correlation appears in the diagrams using the mean and lh95 ages .",
    "narrow co linewidths ( less than 100 km  s@xmath2 ) are associated with young starbursts while older starbursts show greater linewidths ( between 150 and 300 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "there is one apparent exception , mrk 306 , which has an older starburst and a narrow linewidth , but the co line profile shows several components , only one of which is taken into account in the measure of the linewidth , because it is at least twice as strong as the two others .",
    "we have checked that the correlation between co linewidth and starburst age does not depend on the distance or on the absolute magnitude ( or , equivalently , the mass ) of the galaxy ; narrow linewidths are not associated with low mass objects .",
    "we have also verified that the co linewidth is _ independent _ of the hi linewidth .    the dispersion in fig .",
    "1 may have several causes .",
    "the dispersion in starburst ages could be due to the contamination by younger extra - nuclear hii regions .",
    "it could also partly be due to errors on the ages , which range from 1 to 2  myr .",
    "the dispersion in the co linewidths could be attributed to external causes like the interaction with a companion .",
    "let us recall that most galaxies of our sample are peculiar in one way or another ( cf .",
    "it could also be partly due to the uncertainties on the angle @xmath15 .",
    "there could also be internal causes , such as the resolving power of the radiotelescope at different frequencies .",
    "when the co linewidth at 115 and at 230  ghz are different , this may mean that the co emission is resolved at the lower frequency .",
    "but different linewidth at the two frequencies may also be due to different physical conditions ; this seems to be the case for mrk 1485 , for which the linewidth at the higher frequency is larger than that at the lower frequency .",
    "furthermore , in mrk  306 , there is a great difference between the co(1@xmath00 )  and co(2@xmath01 )  linewidths .",
    "the difference is due to the position of the most luminous hii region which is 7.8  from the nucleus , inside the co(1@xmath00)beam but outside the co(2@xmath01 )  one ; for this galaxy , we only retained the co(1@xmath00 )  data .",
    "let us now interpret the correlation between co linewidth and starburst age .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the evolution of starbursts and co distributions in the central regions of galaxies , since the starburst ages of our sample are those of _ nuclear _ hii regions .",
    "the first explanation that comes to mind is that the molecular clouds are initially concentrated right near the nucleus ( @xmath16 100 pc ) .",
    "the lines are broadened by galactic rotation , assuming a standard rotation curve ( sofue 1996 ) and/or by the velocity dispersion among individual clouds due to the kinetical energy from supernovae and stellar winds associated with the starburst ( irwin & sofue 1996 ) .",
    "as the starburst ages , the gas expands outward ( @xmath17 500 pc ) and the lines become wider because the clouds take part in the galactic rotation .",
    "the problems with this scenario are that most of the gas must stay in the disk and that there is no physical mechanism by which the clouds can acquire enough angular momentum to participate to the galactic rotation .",
    "this is moreover in contradiction with the fact that the gas on the contrary tends to lose angular momentum ( in the inflow scenario ) .",
    "a classical gas inflow can not explain the correlation either , since it predicts that the starbursts may be ignited in a circum - nuclear ring before the gas reaches the center , and young starbursts with broad co lines are expected .",
    "another possibility is that the clouds are pushed outward , preferentially out of the plane of the galaxy , by powerful outflowing winds generated by supernova explosions ( heckman et al .",
    "the broadening of the lines is then due to expansion rather than to rotation .",
    "the problem here is that the line profiles should be double peaked , which is generally not the case in our sample .",
    "none of the above scenarii , outflow of molecular gas inside or out of the disk , are completely satisfactory .",
    "this correlation remains a puzzling problem which deserves more work .",
    "on one hand , the numerical simulations must increase both their spatial and temporal resolutions and include an energetic starburst in the nucleus of galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", we must acquire higher resolution ( @xmath18 100 pc ) co observations in the nuclei of galaxies at different stages of starburst evolution .",
