    "this paper introduces a logical apparatus that enables one to study in a formal setting basic interdependencies between what can be called ( cf .   [ philosophy ] ) two modes of knowledge : knowledge - that ( or knowledge of truths ) and knowledge - how ( or knowledge of methods ) . in mathematical practice , these have been traditionally represented by _ propositions _",
    "( i.e. , assertions , such as theorems and conjectures ) and _ problems _ ( such as geometric construction problems and initial value problems ) . the english word `` problem '' is , in fact , somewhat imprecise ; we will use it in the narrow sense of a request ( or desire ) to find a construction meeting specified criteria on output and permitted means ( as in `` chess problem '' ) .",
    "this meaning is less ambiguously captured by the german _ aufgabe _ ( as opposed to the german _ problem _ ) and the russian _  _ ( as opposed to _  _ ) .",
    "english words with related meanings include _ task , assignment , exercise , challenge , aim , mission_.    to appreciate the difference between problems and propositions , let us note firstly that the problem requesting to find a proof of a proposition @xmath4 is closely related to both ( i ) the proposition asserting that @xmath4 is true ; and ( ii ) the proposition asserting that @xmath4 is provable .",
    "these are not the same , of course , whenever `` proofs '' are taken to be in some formal theory @xmath5 and `` truth '' is taken according to some two - valued model @xmath6 of @xmath5 , with respect to which @xmath5 is not complete",
    ". could consist of the axioms of planar geometry except for the axiom of parallel lines , and @xmath6 could be the euclidean planar geometry .",
    "one could object that it would be fair to compare truth according to euclidean geometry with proofs in its complete theory ; but then @xmath5 could be peano arithmetic or zfc , which by gdel s theorem are not complete with respect to any models .",
    "( see @xcite*[int : conjectures ] for a more detailed discussion . ) ] there are other reasons why `` true '' should not be equated with `` provable '' ; for instance , they differ also in the modal logic s4 , where it is a simple consequence of the axioms that consistency is provable .",
    "conversely , the proposition asserting that two groups @xmath7 and @xmath8 are isomorphic is closely related to both ( i ) the problem requesting to prove that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are isomorphic ; and ( ii ) the problem requesting to construct an isomorphism between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these are generally not the same because one proof that an isomorphism exists might represent several distinct isomorphisms or no specific isomorphism .",
    "the logical distinction between problems and theorems ( as they appear , in particular , in euclid s _ elements _ ) has been articulated at length by a number of ancient greek geometers in response to others who disputed it .",
    "a detailed review of what the ancients had to say on this matter is included in the second part of this paper @xcite*[g2:ancient ] . in modern times , the distinction was emphasized by kolmogorov @xcite    a key difference between problems and propositions is that the notion of truth for propositions has no direct analogue for problems , so that problems can not be asserted .",
    "for instance , let @xmath9 be the problem _ divide any given angle into three equal parts with compass and ( unmarked ) ruler_. then @xmath10 reads , _ divide any given angle into three equal parts with compass and ruler or prove that it is impossible to do so _",
    "@xcite*[int : about - bhk ] and [ insolubility ] below ) .",
    "this is not a trivial problem ; indeed , its solution took a couple of millennia .",
    "even now that a solution is well - known , the problem still makes perfect sense : the law of excluded middle would not help a student to solve this problem on an exam ( in galois theory ) . by citing the law of excluded middle she could solve another problem : _",
    "prove that either @xmath9 has a solution or @xmath9 has no solutions ; _ in symbols , @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the proposition _ there exists a solution of the problem @xmath9 _ , and @xmath13 denotes the problem _ prove the proposition @xmath4_. can serve as a concise typing symbol for propositions , and @xmath1 for problems . by placing a typing symbol in front of a sentence",
    "we indicate its conversion into the corresponding type .",
    "] in fact , this problem is strictly easier than @xmath14 ( in words , _ prove or disprove that @xmath9 has a solution _ ) , which requires a justified explicit choice .",
    "but the latter problem , which can be written equivalently as @xmath15 , is still strictly easier than the original problem , @xmath10 , for it is generally easier to prove that some problem has a solution than to actually solve it .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of the logical operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a formal setting . like in the previous example",
    ", @xmath1 is meant to refer to _ non - constructive _ proofs , whereas @xmath0 is understood to signify _ explicit _ existence .",
    "we extract axioms and rules governing the use of @xmath0 and @xmath1 essentially from three sources :    * kolmogorov s 1932 explanation of the intuitionistic connectives @xcite , which had some parallels with the independent writings of heyting ( 1931 ) and was slightly improved by heyting ( 1934 ) ; a disguised form of this explanation has come to be known as the bhk interpretation of intuitionistic logic ( see @xcite*[int : intro ] for a detailed review and discussion ) ; * gdel s 1933 translation of problems into modal propositions @xcite ( reviewed briefly in @xcite*[int : provability ] ) , which can be seen as a formalization of earlier attempts of meaning explanations of intuitionistic logic by orlov ( 1928 ) and heyting ( 1930 , 31 ) ( see a detailed review in  [ letters1 ] ) ; without , to be sure , specifying a precise formalism '' @xcite ( see also @xcite*p .",
    "a certain precise formalism attempting to capture kolmogorov s interpretation alone is specified in @xcite*[int : weak bhk ] .",
    "* the proclus  kreisel principle : a solution of a problem should include not only a construction , but also a verification , i.e.  a proof that the construction meets the requirements specified in the problem ( see @xcite*[int : about - bhk ] for a discussion ) .    it then comes as a little surprise that the resulting axioms and rules harbor a great deal of unintended symmetries , and are also compatible with kolmogorov s double negation translation of propositions into problems ( reviewed briefly in @xcite*[int : negneg ] ) .",
    "( for a different connection between the two translations see @xcite . )",
    "what is most surprising , however , is that nobody seems to have studied the operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 before , apart from hints of an abandoned project aimed at a similar study , found in kolmogorov s own writings . in his 1931 letter to heyting @xcite , kolmogorov wrote :    not much remains apart from this fragment and the quote in the abstract .",
    "several problems consisting in proving a proposition are also mentioned in kolmogorov s paper @xcite . in a more detailed discussion of kolmogorov",
    "s letters to heyting in  [ letters2 ] we note that while propositions of type ( @xmath16 ) seem to stand precisely for the objects of intuitionistic logic , propositions of type ( @xmath17 ) could not be intended to exhaust all objects of classical logic ; in fact , it appears that they can be identified with the stable propositions of  [ stable and decidable ] .",
    "another divergence between the approach taken in the present paper and kolmogorov s ideas on how problems are related to propositions is revealed in [ insolubility ] and discussed in @xcite*[int : about - bhk ] .",
    "modern literature contains a number of attempts to blend classical and intuitionistic logics .",
    "on the one hand , apart from refinements of the classical translations ( see @xcite ) , there are the linear logic and the logics of japaridze @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and liang ",
    "miller @xcite , @xcite , which all have something classical and something intuitionistic in them  albeit fused in far more elaborate ways than kolmogorov could have possibly meant in his words : `` creation of a unified logical apparatus dealing with objects of two types  propositions and problems  was intended '' @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is artmov s logic of proofs , which he actually meant to address these very words of kolmogorov @xcite*p .  2 , @xcite*p .  10 ( p.  204 ) .",
    "it is clear , however , from kolmogorov s letter quoted above , that he did envisage the `` two types '' to be on equal footing , which is not the case in artmov s logic .",
    "also , for instance , the following expression found in kolmogorov s paper @xcite : `` in the case where the problem @xmath18 consists in proving a proposition '' does not seem to be compatible with artmov s approach .",
    "we will discuss a conjectural combination of artmov s approach and the approach of the present paper in ",
    "[ self - reference ] .",
    "what is more obviously related to kolmogorov s research program is the `` propositions - as-_some_-types '' paradigm , and indeed our composite operator @xmath3 on problems is very similar to the squash / bracket operator in intuitionistic type theories ( see  [ galois subsection ] and [ russel - prawitz ] ) .",
    "there are also similarities between our approach and some ideas behind the calculus of constructions , see @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a direct type - theoretic analogue of our @xmath0 due to aczel and gambino @xcite*1.3 is dissimilar to @xmath0 in that it satisfies a reversible analogue of our schema ( @xmath19 ) ( see  [ deductive ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the reversibility of our ( @xmath19 ) would amount to allowing the bhk interpretation to represent arbitrary , and not just constructive functions ( see @xcite*[int : confusion ] ) .",
    "but there is nothing surprising here , since aczel and gambino do not assume the law of excluded middle on either the two sides .    a type - theoretic analogue of our @xmath1 due to coquand @xcite*1 satisfies an analogue of our schema ( @xmath20 ) ( see  [ symmetry ] ) , which coquand argues to express `` heyting s semantics of the universal quantification '' .",
    "this time we see a full agreement on the syntactic level ; but it is remarkable that our formalization of the bhk clause for the universal quantification is not ( @xmath20 ) , which is reversible just like its coquand s version , but ( @xmath21 ) ( see  [ deductive ] ) , which is irreversible for the same reasons as ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "i would like to thank l. beklemishev , m. bezem , g. dowek and d. shamkanov for valuable discussions and useful comments .",
    "a part of this work was carried out while enjoying the hospitality and stimulating atmosphere of the institute for advanced study and its univalent foundations program .",
    "in this paper we work in first - order logic , with a few points of divergence from what may be seen as a standard practice :    * where standard terminology is biased to towards either classical logic or brouwer s conception of intuitionistic logic as a correction of classical logic , we use the more neutral terminology of @xcite*[int : formal ] that is also compatible with kolmogorov s conception of intuitionstic logic as the logic of problem solving .",
    "+ thus we speak of _ primary laws _ , which may be also called `` axiom schemes '' in classical logic and modal logics based on classical logic , and `` postulate schemes '' in intuitionistic logic and modal logics based on intuitionistic logic .",
    "we also speak of _ logical variables _ , which specialize to propositional and predicate variables in the classical case and to problem variables ( possibly with parameters ) in the intuitionistic case .",
    "in fact , we do not speak of `` predicates '' or `` free variables '' , but rather of propositions with parameters ( and problems with parameters ) . *",
    "we adhere to a formal treatment of metavariables ( see @xcite*[int : formal ] ) , which means that every _ schema _ represents a fully determined set of formulas ( called the _ instances _ of the schema ) , where most normally expected side conditions ( of the sort `` provided that @xmath22 is not free in @xmath17 '' or `` provided that @xmath23 is free for @xmath22 in @xmath24 '' ) are included automatically by our conventions , and no additional side conditions can be added without breaking the conventions .",
    "let us now describe the language of the qhc calculus .",
    "* the only terms of qhc are the individual variables @xmath25 , where the first three admit an alternative spelling : @xmath26 . *",
    "each formula of qhc has one and only one of two types : it is either a _ problem _ or a _ proposition_. as a notational convention , lowercase greek letters denote problems , and lowercase roman letters denote propositions ( thus , lowercase letters are formula variables in the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "uppercase letters that are distinctively greek denote schemata of problems , and uppercase letters that are distinctively roman denote schemata of propositions ; uppercase letters that according to tex  are both greek and roman stand for formulas or schemata of unspecified type .",
    "* qhc contains logical variables @xmath27 of proposition type and @xmath28 of problem type .",
    "we fix some alternative spellings for proposition / predicate variables : @xmath29 ; and for problem variables : @xmath30 . *",
    "logical operators of qhc are either type - specific ( i.e.  all of their input and output must have the same type ) or type - conversion ( i.e.  unary operators with one input type and a different output type ) .",
    "type - specific , that is , classical and intuitionistic logical operators are the unary connective @xmath31 ; the binary connectives @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; and the quantifiers @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we do not differentiate graphically between classical and intuitionistic connectives , since they can be distinguished by the type of the formulas that they act upon .",
    "however , we will notationally distinguish classical @xmath38-ary connectives @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the intuitionistic @xmath38-ary connectives @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "of the listed connectives , @xmath35 , @xmath31 , @xmath40 and @xmath39 are abbreviations : @xmath42 abbreviates @xmath43 ; @xmath44 abbreviates @xmath45 ; and @xmath40 and @xmath39 abbreviate @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "* the unary connective @xmath1 inputs a proposition @xmath48 and outputs a problem @xmath49 . * the unary connective @xmath0 inputs a problem @xmath17 and outputs a proposition @xmath50 .",
    "* there are two basic types of judgements : @xmath51 , with intended meaning as in the usual interpretation of classical logic ( based on truth tables , cf .",
    "@xcite*[int : tarski truth ] ) , and @xmath52 , with intended meaning as in the clarified bhk interpretation @xcite*[int : clarified ] .",
    "* there are four kinds of syntactic consequence : @xmath53 ( purely classical ) and @xmath54 ( purely intuitionistic ) , as well as @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( mixed ) ; their intended meaning is discussed below .",
    "we will later see that the qhc calculus is conservative over classical predicate logic as well as over intuitionistic predicate logic , whence for a proposition schema @xmath57 involving no @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s , @xmath51 is equivalent to saying that @xmath57 is a classical validity ; and for a problem schema @xmath58 involving no @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s , @xmath52 is equivalent to saying that @xmath58 is an intuitionistic validity .    in",
    "what follows , we shall abbreviate by @xmath59 the judgement @xmath60 and by @xmath61 the judgement @xmath62 . here",
    "both of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are either problem schemata or proposition schemata .",
    "we may also write e.g.  @xmath65 to mean `` @xmath59 and @xmath66 '' , etc .",
    "let us recall ( cf .",
    "@xcite*[int : logic ] ) that the notion of a first - order _ logic _ is understood in ( at least ) two different ways in the literature : in the `` formulaic '' conception , it only matters which schemata are valid laws of the logic ; whereas in the `` inferential '' conception , to specify a logic one also needs to know what its derivable rules are . this leads , in particular , to two distinct notions of completeness with respect to a model or a class of models ( cf .",
    "@xcite*[int : models ] ) , and also to two distinct interpretations of syntactic consequence ( or , equivalently , of derivable rules ) :    * in the `` formulaic '' conception , there is no special interpretation for derivable rules other than their interpretation as admissible rules .",
    "( the latter is available as soon as an interpretation of laws is given . ) * in the `` inferential '' conception , there is a special interpretation for derivable rules . for classical and intuitionistic logic",
    "it is given in @xcite*[int : extended ] , and it is not hard to combine the two to get such an interpretation for qhc .",
    "( the general form of the judgement is determined by the type of the consequent of the rule . )",
    "it is a little tedious to write out either of these two interpretations in full generality , so we will instead discuss how they work for the actual inference rules of qhc .",
    "the primary laws and inference rules of the qhc calculus are as follows .",
    "* all inference rules and axiom schemes of classical predicate logic ( see @xcite*[int : logics ] ) applied to all propositions ( possibly involving the symbols @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . *",
    "all inference rules and postulate schemes of intuitionistic predicate logic ( see @xcite*[int : logics ] ) applied to all problems ( possibly involving the symbols @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "* three groups of additional inference rules , axiom schemes and postulate schemes .",

    "@xmath72 .",
    "informally , ( @xmath73 ) says that @xmath41 is not just the hardest problem ( as guaranteed by explosion , @xmath74 ) , but a problem that has no solutions whatsoever .",
    "this is just the first example of how some content found in the bhk interpretation and not entirely captured in the usual formalization of intuitionistic logic is more fully captured in qhc .    to these axiom schemes we are adding the following inference rule :    1 .   @xmath75 .",
    "when understood as an admissible rule , ( @xmath76 ) is saying that given a parameterless schema @xmath77 , if there exists a general method of solving all particular problems of the form @xmath78 , then there exists a solution of every particular problem of this form . is true '' .",

    "the remaining part of the deductive system deals with the operator @xmath1 and can be regarded as an extension of the bhk interpretation , motivated by gdel s translation of intuitionistic logic into classical modal logic s4 ( see @xcite*[int : provability ] ) .",
    "in fact , in an outline of his 1938 lecture , published posthumously in 1995 , gdel mentioned the following proof - relevant analogue of s4 @xcite .",
    "it includes a binary predicate @xmath87 , with intended reading _ @xmath23 is a proof of @xmath48 _ , where the `` proof '' is `` understood not in a particular system , but in the absolute sense ( that is , one can make it evident ) '' .",

    "gdel s provability translation , as well as his proof - relevant s4 that we relied upon heavily in motivating our formulation of qhc ( see  [ deductive ] ) were anticipated by informal provability interpretations of intuitionistic logic in the papers by heyting @xcite , @xcite and , independently , orlov @xcite*6,7 ( see also @xcite for a discussion of orlov s work in english ) .",
    "we will now briefly review these papers , which will also prepare us for a discussion of kolmogorov s letter to heyting @xcite .",
    "all three papers focused mainly on a pair of operators , which we will denote @xmath486 and @xmath487 for consistency , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( orlov writes @xmath488 and @xmath489 ; and in his second paper @xcite , heyting writes @xmath486 and @xmath31 . )",
    "if @xmath48 is a proposition , both heyting and orlov interpret @xmath490 as _ @xmath48 is provable_. orlov states unambiguously that @xmath486 is constrained precisely by what turns out to be the modal axioms of qs4 ; but neither of @xmath491 , @xmath492 , @xmath493 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "orlov erroneously believed that the use of full classical logic would trivialize the @xmath486 operator . ]",
    "heyting says only that `` a logic that would treat properties of the function @xmath486 would [ ... ] be purely hypothetical ; [ ... ] one can not ask [ the intuitionistic mathematicians ] to develop this logic '' @xcite .",
    "heyting interprets @xmath494 as `` @xmath48 implies a contradiction '' and calls @xmath487 `` the brouwerian negation '' ; whereas orlov says that it `` has the same meaning '' as brouwer s notion of `` absurdity '' of a proposition in @xcite . at the same time",
    ", orlov is able to identify @xmath494 as @xmath495 , where @xmath31 is the classical negation ; in this connection , heyting only says : `` the negation of a proposition always refers to a proof procedure which leads to the contradiction , even if the original proposition mentions no proof procedure '' @xcite .      in practical terms",
    "this means , in particular , that brouwer s theorem on triple absurdity @xcite should be interpreted as @xmath496 .",
    "thus we consider heyting s earlier claim in @xcite that `` mr .",
    "brouwer has proved that @xmath497 is identical to @xmath494 '' to be in error , as pointed out essentially by heyting himself .",
    "this fully agrees with orlov s independent analysis , which contains valid proofs of @xmath498 and @xmath496 and informal arguments that @xmath499 and @xmath500 .",
    "orlov also supported these judgements by an analysis of brouwer s writings :      apart from these oddities , heyting s both papers and orlov s paper seem to be compatible with each other and with gdel s provability translation .",
    "in particular , both heyting and orlov mention the equivalence of @xmath503 with @xmath504 and of @xmath505 with @xmath494 ; and of the judgements @xmath506 and @xmath507 .",
    "we should mention , however , yet another oddity found in heyting s letter to freudenthal , where he first gave an interpretation of the intuitionistic negation ( see @xcite ) :      we will thus refer to the _ standard interpretation _ of @xmath486 and @xmath487 , where @xmath486 is identified with the modality @xmath151 of qs4 , and @xmath494 is an abbreviation for @xmath510 .",
    "the latter abbreviation is , in fact , very convenient also from a technical viewpoint , for it gives a more intelligible form to judgements that correspond to basic properties of a subset of a topological space under the topological interpretation of qs4 :    * @xmath506 ( or @xmath507 ) : entire space * @xmath511 ( or @xmath512 ) : empty set * @xmath513 ( or @xmath514 ) : boundary set ( @xmath515 interior is empty @xmath515 complement is dense ) * @xmath516 ( or @xmath517 ) : dense set ( @xmath515 closure is the entire space ) * @xmath518 ( or @xmath519 ) : complement is nowhere dense ( @xmath515 interior is dense ) * @xmath520 ( or @xmath521 ) : nowhere dense set ( @xmath515 closure is a boundary set )          heyting s second paper @xcite contains a virtually identical discussion but with a different choice of @xmath48 , namely , the one asserting that a given rational number lies within every interval with rational endpoints that contains euler s constant @xmath522 .    heyting s claims",
    "are confirmed rigorously in the standard interpretation , since there exist dense boundary sets ( for instance , @xmath523 viewed as a subset of @xmath524 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with kolmogorov s claims in his first letter to heyting @xcite :    kolmogorov insists that every proposition @xmath48 of type ( @xmath17 ) satisfies @xmath525 , apparently because @xmath48 comes endowed with a constructive procedure of verification of the validity of every particular instance of @xmath48 ; from @xmath526 we infer that this procedure actually returns a positive result on all inputs ; thus it yields a constructive proof of @xmath48 .",
    "this applies to the example of @xmath48 cited by kolmogorov , _ every even number is a sum of two primes _ , since it can be verified constructively whether a given specific number @xmath481 is a sum of two primes ( by exhausting all primes @xmath527 ) .",
    "the same applies to the other example of heyting , and in general to every proposition of the form @xmath528 , where the validity of @xmath91 is verifiable by a finite procedure .",
    "propositions are sometimes claimed to be precisely the propositions accessible to hilbert s finitistic reasoning ( see @xcite*p .",
    "]    however , already the classical negation @xmath328 of such a proposition @xmath48 , for instance , the proposition _ there exists an even number that is not a sum of two primes _ , is presumably neither of type ( @xmath17 ) nor of type ( @xmath16 )  since it does not assert that such a number can be constructed explicitly .",
    "( in contrast , @xmath494 must be of type ( @xmath16 ) , according to kolmogorov s ( 4 ) . ) in his second letter to heyting , kolmogorov himself speaks of propositions that are neither of type ( @xmath17 ) nor of type ( @xmath16 ) :    if the @xmath529 and @xmath530 are assumed to be real numbers ( heyting s reply to kolmogorov s first letter , which would clarify this matter , is not available ; see , however , a fragment of heyting s letter to becker below ) then the proposition @xmath531 amounts to an existentially quantified proposition about rational numbers ( or integers ) . in this case , kolmogorov s statement ` @xmath532 is solvable for each @xmath22 ' , where the problem @xmath532 is instantiated as `` prove that @xmath533 '' will be of the form @xmath534 , to use the notation of qhc . as observed by troelstra @xcite ,      to summarize , in our interpretation , heyting is right in that one can have at the same time @xmath513 and @xmath516 ; and kolmogorov is right in that one can not have these two at the same time if @xmath48 is as in any of heyting s two examples , or more generally if @xmath48 is a proposition either of type ( @xmath17 ) or of type ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "if we try extract precise definitions from kolmogorov s letter , propositions of type ( @xmath17 ) satisfy @xmath535 and presumably no other identities ( we assume , following heyting , that _ all _ propositions satisfy @xmath536 , so kolmogorov s @xmath537 is automatic ) ; whereas propositions of type ( @xmath16 ) satisfy @xmath538 and presumably no other identities . on the standard interpretation of @xmath486 and @xmath487 , propositions of type ( @xmath16 ) should then correspond to all open sets , and propositions of type ( @xmath17 ) to all sets @xmath57 such that @xmath539 .",
    "this includes , in particular , all closed sets and all regular open sets , and no other open sets .",
    "although this is clearly not what kolmogorov could have meant regarding the formula @xmath540 , which under the standard interpretation of @xmath487 and @xmath486 is equivalent to @xmath541 , it is worth observing that @xmath542 is an admissible rule for qs4 . indeed , in a topological model , @xmath543 corresponds to @xmath544 , that is , the frontier @xmath545 , where @xmath57 interprets @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath546 is a special case of the schema @xmath48 , we claim that @xmath547 . indeed ,",
    "in a topological model @xmath6 where all atomic subformulas are interpreted by the entire space , @xmath548 will be either empty or the entire space for any instance @xmath91 of @xmath546 ; in either case , @xmath549 .",
    "thus @xmath550 .",
    "kolmogorov concluded his first letter to heyting with the proposal of two operators from propositions of type ( @xmath17 ) to problems .",
    "the first operator , _ prove the given proposition _ , resembles the restriction of our operator `` @xmath1 '' , which is defined on all propositions .",
    "the second operator , _ derive a contradiction from the given proposition _ , resembles what we denote by @xmath551 .",
    "( note , however , that to interpret kolmogorov s first operator @xmath487 as @xmath552 , one has to extend the domain of his second operator @xmath486 to the classical negations of propositions of type ( @xmath17 ) . ) in this setup , kolmogorov s propositions of type ( @xmath17 ) are precisely those propositions that satisfy @xmath316 ( note that one of the two negations is classical and the other one is intuitionistic ) ."
