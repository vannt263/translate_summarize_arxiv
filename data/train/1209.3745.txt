    "<S> one of the most welcome properties of the measure would be its _ </S>",
    "<S> additivity_. in theorem [ thm:2add ] , we show that for families of isotropic xor - boxes @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath62-copy additive i.e. @xmath63 for @xmath64 . for boxes which are extremal within the family of isotropic xor - boxes ( such as @xmath9 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) @xmath31 and @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> are additive i.e. that the latter statement is true for any natural @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture however , that proposed measures are additive for all isotropic xor - boxes </S>",
    "<S> .    another welcome property would be monotonicity of @xmath31 and @xmath32 under operations which preserve contextuality . </S>",
    "<S> we answer partially this question showing in subsection [ app : props - of - measures ] that they are non - increasing under a natural subclass of contextuality preserving operations .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the contextuality cost._-we would like to note , that there is an obvious way to quantify contextuality using strength of violation of some kochen - specker ( ks ) inequality . </S>",
    "<S> this approach however is not universal , since there are boxes that are contextual but do not violate this specific ks - inequality . does not violate inequality ( [ eq : beta - n-1 ] ) in with @xmath68 . ] </S>",
    "<S> thus we demand that our measure of contextuality @xmath69 should be _ faithful _ i.e. nonzero iff the box is contextual .    </S>",
    "<S> another approach is to base on some known measures of non - locality and define it properly for all ( also one - partite ) boxes . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to the _ contextuality cost _ , which we define as follows : c(b ) : = \\{p| b = p b_c + ( 1-p)b_nc } where infimum is taken over all decompositions of box @xmath19 into mixture of some non - contextual box @xmath70 and some contextual box @xmath71 . this measure inherits after nonlocality cost the property that it is _ not increasing _ under operations that _ preserve non - contextuality _ , which are the operations satisfying the following axioms : ( i ) transform boxes into boxes ( ii ) are linear ( iii ) preserve consistency ( iv ) transform non - contextual boxes into non - contextual ones . </S>",
    "<S> this holds for the same reason for which the anti - robustness of nonlocality is non - increasing under class of _ locality preserving operations _ as it is shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note also that this measure is by definition faithful , and one can easily compute it using linear programming @xcite , it is however not _ extensive _ i.e. is not proportional to dimension of the system . for the families of isotropic boxes </S>",
    "<S> , it can be found analytically namely that @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( in the same way as it is shown in @xcite that @xmath75 ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions._-we have proposed a framework to quantify contextuality . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we have introduced measures of state dependent / independent contextuality which are valid for both the single and many party scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> our approach can be developed in different ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , one can define analogous measures to @xmath31 and @xmath32 setting variational distance in place of relative entropy .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also consider a measure defined as @xmath76 , i.e. with changed order of min and sup in ( [ eq : imax ] ) which for non - local boxes has been studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this measure have more communicational meaning than @xmath32 , it is minimal capacity of the channel from sender to receiver under adversary s attack . </S>",
    "<S> note , that another way of defining relative entropy of contextuality , would be to consider a quantity defined on a box @xmath19 compatible with graph @xmath37 as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 denotes relative entropy of the boxes @xmath19 and @xmath70 defined operationally via distinguishability of box @xmath19 from box @xmath70 in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to relate such defined measure with @xmath32 and @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> note also , that following @xcite it is easy to define and study notion of ( anti)robustness of contextuality . </S>",
    "<S> this measure will be used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would be also interesting to investigate possible connection between our measures and entropic tests of contextuality put forward in @xcite ( which have their roots in entropic bell inequalities @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that our measures can be useful for description of experimental results as they are based on correlations between measurement outcomes rather than on mutual exclusiveness of observables . </S>",
    "<S> it is important , since in practice it is very difficult to satisfy the latter condition in experiment .    </S>",
