    "* sample preparation : * commercially available single crystalline silicon ( 100 ) membranes ( norcada inc . ) with a thickness of 250 nm and window size of 3.2@xmath553.2  mm@xmath56 were used to fabricate 2d pncs  @xcite .",
    "pmma 950k ( allresist ) was spun at 4000 rpm for one minute , followed by a 60 min bake at 100@xmath57c in an oven .",
    "electron beam lithography ( raith 150-two ) was carried out to pattern ordered and disordered pncs with a hole size of 175 nm and a pitch of 300 nm for the ordered pncs and equal filling fraction of @xmath37 for the disordered pncs ( c.f .",

    "the dimensions of the structures were @xmath58 @xmath59 m .",
    "after development in 1:3 methyl isobutyl ketone : isopropanol ( mibk : ipa ) , the samples were post - baked for 1 min in 80@xmath57c on a hot plate .",
    "the pattern was transferred to silicon using the reactive ion etching bosch process ( alcatel ams-110de ) and finally the samples were cleaned in an oxygen plasma system ( pva tepla ) .",
    "* femtosecond pump - probe reflectivity measurements : * femtosecond pump - probe reflectivity measurements based on the asynchronous optical sampling ( asops ) technique  @xcite were used to investigate the acoustic phonon dynamics of ordered and disordered pncs and unpatterned membranes in the hypersonic ( ghz ) frequency range .",
    "the experimental method is based on two asynchronously coupled ti : sapphire ring cavity lasers with a repetition rate of 1 ghz and a nominal pulse length of about 50 fs .",
    "the time delay between the pump and probe pulses is achieved through an actively stabilized frequency offset of 10 khz between the repetition rate of the two laser oscillators .",
    "this allows for a linearly increasing time delay between pump and probe pulses with steps of 10 fs without the need for a mechanical delay line .",
    "owing to the high repetition rate of 1 ghz , an excellent signal - to - noise ratio of above @xmath60 can be achieved for typical acquisition times in the seconds to minutes range .",
    "pump - probe reflectivity measurements were performed by focusing both lasers collinear onto the pnc membranes using a 50@xmath55 microscopy objective ( olympus , na = 0.55 ) in normal incidence geometry , resulting in a spot size of about 2  @xmath61 m which corresponds to an excitation area in the pnc of about 35 unit cells .",
    "the pump laser was tuned to a center wavelength of 770 nm with an average power of 8 mw and the probe laser to 830 nm with a power of 4 mw .",
    "the reflected probe laser was spectrally filtered by a long - pass filter at 800 nm to eliminate contributions from the pump laser and recorded with a low noise photodetector with 125 mhz bandwidth .    *",
    "two - laser raman thermometry : * thermal conductivity measurements were conducted using two - laser raman thermometry , a novel technique recently developed to investigate the thermal properties of suspended membranes  @xcite . a spatially fixed heating laser generates a localized steady - state thermal excitation , whereas a low power probe laser measures the spatially - resolved temperature profile with sub - micrometer resolution through the temperature dependent raman frequency of the optical phonons in the material .",
    "both lasers were focused on the pncs using 50@xmath55 microscope objectives with numerical apertures of na = 0.55 .",
    "the power of the heating laser with a wavelength of @xmath62  nm was set to 1  mw and the power of the probe laser with a wavelength of @xmath63  nm to 0.1  mw in order to avoid local heating by the probe laser while measuring the temperature field .",
    "the absorbed power is measured for each sample as the difference between incident and transmitted plus reflected light intensities probed by a calibrated system based on a non - polarizing cube beam splitter .",
    "the measurements were performed at ambient pressure which introduces heat losses through convective cooling .",
    "this effect accounts for",
    "about 30% of the thermal conductivity in our samples , i.e. , the measured values for the thermal conductivity of the pncs were @xmath64 wm@xmath43 .",
    "after correcting for the heat transport due to convective cooling we obtained the reported value of @xmath42 wm@xmath43 for the ordered and disordered pncs .",
    "a detailed discussion of the influence of convective cooling on the experimental values obtained for the thermal conductivity in si pncs is being published elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "<S> [ fig3](b ) compared to the bare membrane ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ) arises from band folding and band splitting when the bragg condition is satisfied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering the multitude of different modes in the dispersion relation , the question arises why there are only nine discrete modes visible in the time domain measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the answer becomes clear , if we consider the out - of - plane displacement amplitudes of the different modes according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq1 ] which are plotted together with the measured zone - center phonon frequencies in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3](d ) and [ fig3](e ) enabling an unambiguous identification of the displacement characteristic of each observed modes .    comparing the acoustic phonon spectrum of the ordered pncs with those of the disordered pncs , </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent that the dispersion relation and zone - center phonon frequencies differ significantly . in a disordered pnc , </S>",
    "<S> no individual modes above about 20  ghz can be detected ( see figs .  [ fig2](f ) and [ fig2](i ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this observation demonstrates the importance of translational symmetry to build coherent phonon modes in the hypersonic frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , two modes remain observable which are comparable in frequency and amplitude to the lowest frequency modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the ordered pnc , although significantly broadened . the fact that these modes are largely unaffected by disorder can be understood considering the 3d displacement fields of the lowest frequency modes in the unpatterned membrane ( @xmath10 ) and the ordered pnc ( @xmath30 ) in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d ) and [ fig3](e ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both modes exhibit a large out - of - plane displacement amplitude and similar displacement symmetry indicating that they are mainly governed by the bare membrane and do not depend on the second - order periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , these modes are not significantly affected by the degree of order / disorder in the pncs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be noted that the frequency of the lowest energy mode in the disordered pnc ( 14.6  ghz ) and ordered pnc ( 15.5  ghz ) is slightly smaller compared to the reference membrane ( 16.8  ghz ) which is caused by the softening of the material due to the combined effects of mass removal and periodic arrangement .        up to this point </S>",
    "<S> , we have limited our discussion to the hypersonic ( ghz ) frequency range of the phonon spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that no coherent phonon modes in the ordered and disordered pncs could be observed at frequencies above 55 and 20  ghz , respectively , we use a different approach to investigate the influence of order and disorder on the thermal properties : two laser raman thermometry ( 2lrt )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of this technique with respect to , for example , electrical measurements or time - domain thermoreflectance ( tdtr ) , is given by its contactless nature avoiding the introduction of additional thermal interface resistances . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the thermal conductivity of the pncs can be directly obtained from the measurements without additional modeling . a spatially fixed heating laser generates a localized steady - state thermal excitation , whereas a low power probe laser measures the spatially - resolved temperature profile with sub - micrometer resolution through the temperature dependent raman frequency of the optical phonons in the material . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) displays the temperature profiles for ordered and disordered pncs and the unpatterned si membrane obtained by 2lrt with the experimental arrangement shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](h ) . applying fourier s law in 2-dimensions for a thermally isotropic </S>",
    "<S> medium leads to a temperature field @xmath32 with :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is an arbitrary point in the temperature field , @xmath35 is the absorbed power , @xmath36 is a correction factor for the missing material due to the holes in the pncs with a filling fraction of @xmath37  @xcite , @xmath13 is the thickness of the pnc membranes , and @xmath38 is the thermal conductivity . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath38 can be treated as temperature independent since the temperature range is sufficiently small ( @xmath39 50 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that for the case of bulk si the thermal conductivity changes by about 15% in the range from 350  k to 400  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this variation represents only an upper ( bulk ) limit since the temperature dependence is typically reduced as boundary scattering increases . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) displays the thermal decays in logarithmic scale according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) , thus , the slope of the thermal decay is directly related to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the purely linear decay observed in this graph validates the temperature independent treatment of @xmath40 . a deviation from this linear relation </S>",
    "<S> is expected in cases where @xmath41 as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . based on these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the same value for the thermal conductivity @xmath42 wm@xmath43 for the ordered and disordered pncs compared to @xmath44 wm@xmath43 in case of the unpatterned membrane . </S>",
    "<S> considering the correction factor for the material loss in the holes of the pncs , we would obtain an effective thermal conductivity of the pncs in the absence of size effects of @xmath45 wm@xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in the thermal conductivity of the pncs down to @xmath46% of the value of the unpatterned membrane , about a six - fold reduction , is in accordance with other recent studies of the thermal conductivity of pncs with comparable dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this drastic reduction can not be solely explained by the mass loss due to hole patterning . </S>",
    "<S> instead , two aspects need to be considered : ( i ) diffuse boundary scattering and ( ii ) phonon coherence . </S>",
    "<S> a decrease of thermal conductivity by diffuse boundary scattering is expected due to the increase of the surface area caused by the introduction of holes as well as the hole wall roughness of about 7  nm due to the patterning process ( c.f . figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e ) and [ fig1](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we address the issue of phonon coherence by plotting in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) the phonon frequencies of the measured coherent acoustic phonons ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) as function of the characteristic size @xmath47 limiting in each case the measured phonon frequency range , i.e. surface roughness , hole wall roughness , and average lattice site displacement . </S>",
    "<S> next , we plot the corresponding phonon frequencies for selected specularity parameters @xmath3 as function of @xmath47 : @xmath48 where the specularity parameter @xmath3 expresses a quantitative measure for the percentage of specular scattering at a normal surface with given roughness ( 1 for purely specular scattering and 0 for purely diffusive scattering ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath3 as function of the phonon wavelength is displayed for given values of @xmath47 in si fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 . attempting to derive a general criteria for the non - coherent phonon regime ( fully diffusive phonon scattering ) , </S>",
    "<S> we extrapolate the specularity parameter towards 0 in si fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding phonon wavelength is given in good approximation by the line for @xmath49  0.01 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) . by plotting the phonon wavelength @xmath50 as function of roughness for this specularity parameter </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath51 as simple criteria for the non - coherent phonon regime . following this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain frequency limits of 800  ghz , 115  ghz , and 36  ghz for surface roughness values of 1  nm , 7  nm , and 22.5  nm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the specularity parameter as introduced by ziman  @xcite only considers the surface roughness for a normal incidence wave , not wall roughness or lattice site displacement . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite the different types of roughness in our phononic crystals , the computed values reproduce the general tendency of the measured decreasing high frequency limit of coherent phonons in our phononic crystals . in fact , our experimental data suggests that phonon coherence is already affected by roughness corresponding to a specularity parameter between 0.3 and 0.5 ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) ) . using the more conservative value of @xmath49  0.5 </S>",
    "<S> , we find in a rough approximation that @xmath52 constitutes a realistic criteria for the coherent phonon regime . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we suggest that disorder , quantified by the average hole displacement from the periodic lattice sites , can also be considered as a type of roughness for long wavelength phonons as can be seen when plotting the measured coherent phonon frequencies of the disordered pncs for a roughness @xmath53  nm in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) : the measured frequencies are in good agreement with the calculated frequency for @xmath49  0.3 - 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any coherent acoustic phonon signal with @xmath54  ghz for the disordered pncs in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](f ) and [ fig2](i ) can then be understood as approaching the frequency limit of the coherent phonon regime for this given level of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> it now becomes clear why no differences between the thermal conductivity of the ordered and disordered pncs should be expected due to coherent effects as confirmed by the equal values of @xmath40 measured in the 2lrt experiments : on the one hand , the hole wall roughness of the ordered and disordered pncs of about 7  nm prevents coherent effects for phonons with frequencies above @xmath39100  ghz ( see fig .  [ fig4](c ) ) whereas on the other hand , the frequencies of the dominant thermal phonons are in the low thz regime . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the wavelengths of thermal phonons at room temperature are below 10  nm and therefore commensurate with the characteristic roughness @xmath47 in the studied samples which excludes any coherent effects based on the above given criteria . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the thermal conductivity is not affected by phonon coherence for both , the ordered and the disordered pncs . even for a roughness value as low as 1  nm </S>",
    "<S> , we predict phonon coherence only up to about 400  ghz at room temperature . according to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) modifications of the thermal conductivity due to phonon coherence will only occur for very smooth surfaces / interfaces where the limit of the coherent phonon regime reaches the thz range or for very low temperatures where the wavelength of the thermal phonons is significantly enlarged and thereby greatly exceeds the characteristic roughness @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also in agreement with a recent study of maire et . </S>",
    "<S> al  @xcite , who observed pronounced modifications of the thermal conductivity depending on the level of disorder in si pncs only for temperatures up to about 10  k.    in conclusion , we have addressed the question to what extend disorder influences the phononic properties of 2-dimensional phononic crystals both in the ghz and thz frequency range . in a first step </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that patterning of a 2d si membrane by an ordered phononic crystal lattice strongly modifies the frequencies and dispersion relation of hypersonic vibrations measured by femtosecond time - domain spectroscopy . using finite element method simulations </S>",
    "<S> we have uniquely identified the displacement characteristic of each mode by the calculation of the dispersion relation and the 3-dimensional displacement fields . in particular , we have developed a simple model that accurately predicts the amplitudes of the out - of - plane displacement for all observed modes in the ordered pncs . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of disorder in the pncs drastically modifies the hypersonic phonon spectrum resulting in the suppression of coherent acoustic phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the thermal conductivity using a novel two laser raman thermometry technique have shown that a six - fold reduction of the thermal conductivity occurs for both ordered and disordered pncs ( @xmath42 wm@xmath43 ) with respect to the unpatterned membrane ( @xmath44 wm@xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on the measured coherent acoustic phonon frequencies for different levels of roughness and disorder we have derived two criteria for the prediction of coherent and non - coherent phonon regimes : ( i ) phonon coherence is unaffected if the roughness @xmath47 is smaller than 1/25 of the phonon wavelength and ( ii ) phonon coherence is destroyed if @xmath47 is greater than 1/10 of the phonon wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the results reveal the impact of surface roughness and disorder on the observation of coherent effects in phononic crystals and demonstrate that the room temperature thermal conductivity in comparable phononic crystals should not be affected by the change of the phonon dispersion resulting from coherent boundary scattering . </S>"
