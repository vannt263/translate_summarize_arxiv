    "the advantageous use of fiber detectors for particle tracking has been demonstrated for very different conditions e.g. in the ua2-experiment @xcite , chorus @xcite , for d0 @xcite and the h1-forward proton spectrometer @xcite . due to the different experimental situation in this applications three types of optoelectronic read out",
    "techniques are applied ",
    "image intensifier plus ccd s , visible light photon counters and position sensitive photomultipliers .",
    "however , all have in common that the precision of space point measurements is given by hits of overlapping fibers of several staggered fiber layers . for high rate experiments demanding online tracking of several hundred particles per 100 nsec bunch crossing such a concept may not work due to too high occupancy of single fiber channels .",
    "we propose in the following to use overlapping fiber roads reading out several thin scintillating fibers with one clear optical fiber .",
    "the demands and the solutions presented below match to a possible application of the detector as the inner tracker in the hera - b project at desy @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have been used by others @xcite to build a fiber detector for the dirac experiment at cern .",
    "the fiber detector under discussion is aimed to detect throughgoing particles with more than 90 % efficiency within less than 100 nsec and a precision of better than 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "the fibers should not change their characteristics significantly after an irradiation of 1  2 mrad .",
    "the sensitive detector part should have a size of  25 x 25 @xmath1 .",
    "the scintillating fibers should be coupled to clear optical fibers of about 3 m length guiding the light to photosensors placed outside the experimental area .",
    "it is assumed that most particles of interest hit the detector perpendicular , i.e. with angles less than five degrees with respect to the beam axis . in this case low occupancy and high light yield are guaranteed by using overlapping fiber roads like schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ bild1 ] .",
    "one fiber road consists of several thin scintillating fibers arranged precisely behind each other and coupled to one thick light guide fiber .",
    "the scintillating fiber diameter determines the space point resolution of the detector .",
    "the number of fibers per road is fixed by the scattering angle of particles and the allowed amount of multiple scattering .",
    "it will also influence the factor of background suppression for tracks with larger inclination or curvature .",
    "the pitch between fiber roads is defined by demanding a homogeneous amount of fiber material across the detector width .    keeping in mind the conditions at hera - b",
    ", we made the following choices :    [ cols= \" < , > , < , < , > , < \" , ]     with @xmath2 and l : diameter and length of scintillating and light guide fibers , n@xmath3 : number of fibers per road , p@xmath4 : distance between neighboured road centers , n@xmath4 : number of roads per detector , w@xmath5 : detector width .",
    "the light guide fibers are read out with the new hamamatsu 64 channel pspm r5900m64 with a pixel size of 2 x 2 mm@xmath6 @xcite . to diminish optical cross talk the thickness of the entrance window of the device",
    "was decreased to 0.8 mm .",
    "the coupling between scintillating and light guide fibers is done by loose plastic connectors .",
    "the light guides are coupled to the pspm using a plastic mask fitting the corresponding pixel pattern .",
    "double clad fibers of three different producers were tested concerning light output , light attenuation and radiation hardness for several fiber diameters and wavelengths of the emitted light .",
    "details of these measurements are given in @xcite .",
    "a few results are summarized below .    the light output of fibers of 500 @xmath0 m diameter",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ bild2 ] .",
    "generally it can be seen , that the light yield decreases with increasing scintillator emission wavelength because the pm sensitivity curve is not unfolded .",
    "there is no remarkable difference between the best materials of the three producers .",
    "a mirror at the end of the fiber increases the light output by a factor 1.7 .",
    "several tests were performed to couple scintillating and light guide fibers . finally the coupling efficiency became better than 95 % , independent of the medium between both parts ( air , glue , grease ) .",
    "the light attenuation of clear fibers was measured coupling them to single scintillating fiber roads excited by a ruthenium source .",
    "the clear fibers were cutted back piece by piece to the length under investigation .",
    "results for two producers are given in fig .",
    "[ bild3 ] .",
    "radiation hardness tests of fibers were made using an intense 70 mev proton beam at the hahn ",
    "meitner  institute berlin .",
    "1 mrad radiation was deposited within a few minutes . for all materials",
    "investigated we observed a damage of the scintillator and the transparency of the fiber which was followed by a long time recovery of up to 600 h. an example is shown in fig [ bild4 ] .",
    "more detailed studies using glued and nonglued fibers and irradiate them in air and nitrogen atmosphere are still ongoing .    summarizing all results of our material studies we decided to use the kuraray fibers",
    "scsf-78 m with a diameter of 480 @xmath0 m for the scintillating part of our detector prototypes . for clear fibers still",
    "two choices seem to be possible : 1.7 mm fibers from kuraray or pol .",
    "hi . tech ..",
    "using winding technology as developed for the chorus experiment @xcite we built a detector production chain at our institute .",
    "a drum of 80 cm diameter allows to produce five detectors at once .",
    "the production time for winding one drum is about 14 h. sticking the fibers to the connector holes is still done by hand and rather time consuming .",
    "a part of the polished end face of one of our detectors is shown in fig .",
    "two other detector prototypes are ordered from industry .",
    "berlin followed a technology proposed by the university of heidelberg @xcite mounting single layers on top of each other using epoxy glue .",
    "each layer is prepared on a v - grooved vacuum table .",
    "one layer per day can be produced in this case .",
    "the connector is here also added by hand .",
    "the production technology used by kuraray is unknown to us .    to get the precision of the detector geometry quantified we measured the coordinates of all fibers of the polished end face of the three detectors . in fig .",
    "6 the deviation from the ideal position is given per fiber road .",
    "some stronger local effects are visible . averaging these results characteristic accuracies of 20 @xmath0 m , 50 @xmath0 m and 10 @xmath0 m are calculated for the zeuthen , gms and kuraray detectors respectively .",
    "two testruns were performed to measure the properties of the produced fiber detectors in a 3 gev electron beam at desy .",
    "the setup used in both cases was very similar and is schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ bild7 ] .",
    "four silicon microstrip detectors are used together with two fiber reference detectors and an external trigger system to predict the position of a throughgoing particle at the detector to be tested . a precision of 50 @xmath0 m and 80 @xmath0 m was reached for that prediction using the geometrical arrangements of testrun 1 and 2 .",
    "the fiber detector signals were registrated after 3 m of light guide in the first case using a 16 channel pm r5900m16 read out with a charge sensitive adc . in the later run",
    "the 64 channel r5900m64 was used and the signals were transfered via a special multiplexer to a flash adc .    in april 1997",
    "first small eight road detectors were investigated to measure the light profile across a fiber road .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "the data can be described simply by taking into account fiber geometry seen by a throughgoing particle .",
    "they allow to calculate the detector efficiency for any particular pitch between the fiber roads .    during the testrun in october 1997",
    "the three full size detector prototypes described in section 4 were investigated in detail . up to now",
    "only preliminary results are derived from about 4 gbyte of data .",
    "a relation of 0.9/1.0/0.8 was found for the average light output of the zeuthen , gms and kuraray detectors .",
    "it seems to be due to the different quality of the end face polishing rather than to the mechanical detector precision .",
    "the detector efficiency and resolution is dependent on the hit selection method used . with a maximum amplitude search for all pspm pixels we calculated rough values of 97 @xmath7 3 % for the efficiency and about 140 @xmath0 m for the resolution of the three detectors .",
    "( see also figs .",
    "9 and 10 ) .",
    "taking into account the finite resolution of our track prediction of 80 @xmath0 m and the total mechanical alignment not better than 50 @xmath0 m this points to a fiber detector resolution of better than 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "work is in progress to qualify these results .",
    "in addition the detector noise has still to be studied in detail .",
    "optical and electrical cross talk will influence the choice of cuts and the hit selection methods and in this way also efficiencies and resolution .",
    "three fiber detector prototypes have been tested .",
    "they are made out of 640 overlapping roads of seven 480 @xmath0 m diameter fibers coupled to 1.7 mm diameter light guides of 3 m length read out with 64 channel photomultipliers .",
    "for all three detectors a preliminary analysis gives an efficiency of about 97 % and a resolution of about 100 @xmath0 m .",
    "these results together with radiation hardness studies of the used fiber material seem to make it possible to use a corresponding detector in a high rate experiment like hera - b . in such case special care",
    "has to be taken to keep noise from optical and electrical cross talk at an acceptable level .",
