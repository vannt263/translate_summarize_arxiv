    "it was first pointed out in ref . @xcite",
    "that limiting the @xmath0 transverse momentum to 6.5 gev suppresses the contribution from the regenerated @xmath0 . for @xmath0 s of high transverse momenta , their nuclear modification factor @xmath171 can thus be calculated by multiplying the last term in eq.([raa - highpt ] ) by the percentage of regenerated @xmath0 s with transverse momentum larger than 6.5 gev divided by the percentage of primordial @xmath0 s with the same range of transverse momenta , which is 0.12 in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev .",
    "of @xmath0 with transverse momentum larger than 6.5 gev versus the number of participants without ( upper panel ) and with ( lower panel ) the shadowing effect in pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev at lhc . dashed , dotted and dot - dashed lines represent , respectively , the contributions to @xmath0 production from primordial hard nucleon - nucleon scattering , regeneration from qgp , and decay of bottom hadrons , and the solid line is the sum of them , without nuclear absorption .",
    "upper and lower solid lines are the @xmath171 obtained with the nuclear absorption cross section of 0 and 28 mb , respectively.,width=7 ]    since it takes time for an initially produced @xmath51 pair to form a charmonium , which depends on the charmonium radius and the relative velocity between charm and anticharm quark @xcite , thermal dissociation of charmonia is thus delayed until charmonia are formed .",
    "since the @xmath0 formation time increases with its transverse momentum as a result of time dilation , this effect becomes more important for @xmath0 s of high transverse momenta that are measured in experiments at lhc . in this study , we treat the formation time as a free parameter to fit the experimental data . using the formation time of 0.5 fm/@xmath120 , which corresponds to 1.4 fm/@xmath120 in the firecylinder frame based on the average of the @xmath0 transverse momenta that are above 6.5 gev , our results for the the nuclear modification factor @xmath171 of @xmath0 with transverse momentum larger than 6.5 gev as a function of the participant number",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ lhca ] without ( upper panel ) and with ( lower panel ) the shadowing effect as well as without ( upper solid curve ) and with ( lower solid curve ) the nuclear absorption effect .",
    "it is seen that the results obtained without the shadowing and the nuclear absorption effect describe reasonably the recent experimental results from the cms collaboration at lhc @xcite shown by solid squares .",
    "also , it is interesting to see that the shoulder structure around @xmath182 in the measured @xmath171 at lhc is roughly reproduced by our model . as suggested in our previous study on the @xmath0 @xmath171 in au+au collisions at rhic , the sudden drop in its value at certain value of @xmath179 reflects the maximum temperature of the formed qgp that is above the dissociation temperature of @xmath0 , because the survival probability of @xmath0 is discontinuous at its dissociation temperature .",
    "moreover , the fact that the shoulder seen at lhc occurs at a smaller number of participants than the value @xmath183 at rhic is consistent with the expectation that the maximum temperature of the qgp formed at lhc that is above the dissociation temperature of @xmath0 happens in more peripheral collisions than at rhic .",
    "we note that the cms collaboration has also measured the fraction of @xmath0 from the decay of bottom hadrons in pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev and found that its nuclear modification factor is about 0.37 , which corresponds to @xmath174 in eq .",
    "( [ raa - highpt ] ) , and is almost independent of the centrality @xcite .     of the @xmath171 of @xmath0 with transverse momentum larger than 6.5 gev in a given centrality to that in the peripheral collision versus the centrality of pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev at lhc .",
    "experimental data shown by solid squares are from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=10 ]    our results can further be compared with the experimental data from the atlas collaboration at lhc @xcite on the centrality dependence of the ratio @xmath184 of the @xmath171 of @xmath0 in a collision of certain centrality to that in the peripheral collision . for this purpose ,",
    "we determine the centrality of a collision using the glauber model as follows @xcite : @xmath185^{ab}\\bigg\\}}{\\int^\\infty_0 2\\pi b^\\prime db^\\prime \\bigg\\{1-\\bigg[1-t_{ab}(b^\\prime)\\sigma_{\\rm inel}^{nn}\\bigg]^{ab}\\bigg\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the numerator is the inelastic cross section of nuclei a and b with the impact parameters between 0 and b , and the denominator is the total inelastic cross section of the two nuclei ; and @xmath186 is the inelastic cross section of a p+p collision at the same collision energy . in fig .",
    "[ lhcb ] , we show the calculated centrality dependence of @xmath187 in pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 tev at lhc with the uncertainty of the reference point , i.e. , the @xmath171 of @xmath0 in the peripheral collision , shown as dashed lines . it is seen that results from our model calculations can reproduce the measured @xmath184 of @xmath0 s with high transverse momenta , and the shadowing and the nuclear absorption effect do not make significant difference in the @xmath184 of @xmath0 .",
    "modeling the evolution of the hot dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions by a schematic viscous hydrodynamics , we have extended the two - component model , that was previously used to describe @xmath0 production in heavy - ion collisions at rhic , to those at sps and lhc . as in our previous studies , we have included the effect due to absorption by the cold nuclear matter on the primordially produced charmonia from initial nucleon - nucleon hard scattering , the dissociation of survived charmonia in the produced hot dense matter , and the regeneration of chamronia from charm and anticharm quarks in the quark - gluon plasma . for heavy - ion collisions at lhc , we have further included the shadowing effect in the initial cold nuclei .",
    "we have also taken into account the medium effects on the properties of the charmonia and their dissociation cross sections by using the screened cornell potential model and the nlo pqcd . with the same quasiparticle model for the equation of state of the qgp and the resonance gas model for that of the hg as used before , we have obtained a lower initial temperature than in our previous study to reach the same final entropy density as a result of the finite viscosity .",
    "consequently , a slightly larger qcd coupling constant was needed to reproduce the measured centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor at rhic .",
    "the calculated nuclear modification factor for heavy - ion collisions at the sps was found to agree with the measured value as well .",
    "for both the sps and rhic , the contribution from the primordial charmonia was found to dominate , although the contribution from the regenerated ones increases from the sps to rhic . for heavy - ion collisions at lhc ,",
    "the regenerated charmonia becomes most important in semi - central to central collisions as a result of the larger number of charm and anticharm quark pairs produced in higher energy collisions .",
    "since the available experimental data from the lhc are for @xmath0 s of transverse momentum @xmath36 gev , we have further considered the contribution of @xmath0 production from the decay of bottom hadrons as its effect increases with increasing @xmath0 transverse momentum and the effect due to the formation time of the @xmath0 .",
    "a reasonable agreement with the preliminary experimental data has been obtained if the shadowing and the nuclear absorption effect is absent . however",
    ", a definitive conclusion can only be made after more refined experimental data becomes available .",
    "furthermore , we have found the similar trend in the centrality dependence of the @xmath171 of @xmath0 at both rhic and lhc that it decreases monotonously in peripheral collisions and then drops at a certain centrality as a result of the onset of an initial qgp temperature higher than the @xmath0 dissociation temperature .",
    "moreover , this takes place in less central collisions at lhc than at rhic , indicating that the initial temperature at the same centrality is higher at lhc than at rhic .",
