    "under the umbrella of linear consensus theory , results are collected that describe the convergence and stability of a very general class of linear time - varying , arithmetic mean driven network dynamics , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "what suffers from this generality is the specificity that is usually needed to make immediate use of those results in applied network problems - problems , which often appear as non - linear and time - invariant dynamics that are inherently driven by non - arithmetic means .",
    "a prime example is the class of kuramoto - type network models @xcite that can be found in a wide range of important applications , e.g. , in power grid studies @xcite , or in neuroscience @xcite .",
    "the collective averaging motion is driven by the so - called chordal mean , which is an average adapted to the circular geometry of phase angles @xcite .",
    "important stability results can indeed be based on linear consensus theory , see , e.g. , the work @xcite , where the authors prove stability by reverse engineering for this particular case a linear time - varying consensus structure from the non - linear time - invariant original system model . in this paper",
    "the starting point is not an existing non - linear network model , but a significant type of average , namely the geometric mean , that shall serve as the driving element in a non - linear dynamic averaging network . in particular , we are interested in designing and studying network protocols which generate geometric mean averaging processes in the same way the arithmetic mean does in linear consensus protocols . for the novel types of",
    "geometric mean driven network dynamics we propose touching points to non - linear problems in chemistry , optimization and analog computation using networked dynamical systems .",
    "the geometric mean plays an important role in various applications .",
    "it is the appropriate tool to evaluate averages on data that exhibits power law relationships , as they arise in describing relative , resp .",
    ", compound growth relations @xcite .",
    "examples of such relations can be found in financial studies @xcite , they are abundant in biology @xcite and chemistry @xcite . for instance , in gene expression networks , the geometric mean of degradation and production rates has been found to act as feedback control gain in linearized dynamics @xcite .",
    "geometric mean averaging appears also in the context of algorithm design , in distributed bayesian consensus filtering and detection schemes , see , e.g.,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "there , the geometric mean arises from the combination of a given network structure and a bayesian update rule , leading to a so - called logarithmic opinion pooling as natural scheme of combining local probabilities , see @xcite , and also @xcite for further reference .    despite the central role of mean functions and averaging structures for stability studies in network problems , yet there are only few works on how specific means , and in particular the geometric mean , drive the ( non - linear ) behavior of such systems .",
    "consensus - like protocols driven by non - arithmetic means with geometric mean as particular case are for instance studied in @xcite in the particular context of opinion dynamics in discrete time .",
    "works on consensus on non - linear space @xcite extend the usual arithmetic averaging in linear consensus to a non - linear configuration space ; the associated non - arithmetic mean results as a by - product of that choice of geometry .",
    "extensions to other mathematical structures include the work on consensus on convex metric spaces @xcite , or on the wasserstein metric space of probability measures @xcite .",
    "none of these works puts in the center of consideration a particular type of average , from where continuous - time network dynamics shall arise .    in this work",
    "we propose and study three novel non - linear consensus protocols on the basis of elementary considerations on how the arithmetic mean appears in the structure of linear consensus protocols and replacing it by the geometric mean functional relationship .",
    "in particular , we contribute by ( i ) introducing geometric mean driven network protocols that we call polynomial , entropic , and scaling - invariant protocol , and ( ii ) we prove convergence to consensus under appropriate connectedness conditions .",
    "( iii ) we show that the entropic consensus system convergences to the ( weighted ) geometric mean of the initial state components , which is the geometric mean extension of the usual ( arithmetic mean ) average consensus problem .",
    "( iv ) we bring the polynomial consensus protocol in relation with reaction rates in chemical kinetics , thus building a bridge between consensus theory and biochemistry .",
    "( v ) we propose a novel variational characterization of the geometric mean in a free energy non - linear constrained minimization problem .",
    "( vi ) we put the three distinct protocols on a common footing by showing that all three protocols describe a particular type of free energy gradient descent flow .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : prelim ] we give an overview on mean functions and linear consensus theory . in section [ sec : meandyn ] we propose the novel protocols and discuss relationships to arithmetic - mean averaging structures in linear consensus networks . in section",

    "the following relationships between the arithmetic mean and consensus system representations and properties are well known in consensus theory : using , a component - wise lti consensus dynamics on a normalized weighted digraph can locally be brought to the open - loop control system form @xmath43    without the requirement of a normalized weighting , a variable time discretization can be chosen such that a local algorithmic update law ( e.g. in an explicit euler scheme ) has the arithmetic mean driven form @xmath44 \\mathrm{am}_w(\\{x_j(t)\\}_{j\\in n_i^+(t)},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , cf . , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "besides its appearance in the local dynamics at a certain instant in time , the arithmetic average unfolds also as asymptotic global system property : in the class of consensus networks being governed by laplacians @xmath46 that are irreducible and balanced for all @xmath47 , the asymptotically reached uniform agreement value is given by the arithmetic mean of the initial condition @xcite .",
    "the problem in which the equilibrium state to be reached is uniform with consensus value @xmath48 is commonly known as the average consensus problem .",
    "the goal in this work is to study the interplay between consensus protocols and the geometric mean . in that , we first seek to understand the various interaction points between the design of lti consensus protocols and the arithmetic mean , and then leverage these observations to derive and study novel geometric mean driven consensus protocols .",
    "for the sake of focus and ease of understanding , we assume the underlying graph to have a constant , i.e. , time - invariant weighting . in our analysis it shall turn out elementary to transform the non - linear time - invariant network protocols to linear time - varying consensus form , so that the following convergence result becomes applicable .",

    ", replacement of the weighted arithmetic mean by the geometric average leads to the protocol @xmath67 from where results again under the assumption of having a balanced weighting , that is , @xmath68 .    in its general form , the polynomial protocol has the structure of a rate equation as it occurs for instance in reaction networks and chemical kinetics @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath69 the non - linear rate at which some quantity `` @xmath70 '' flows from in - connected nodes @xmath21 to node @xmath22 , and @xmath71 the rate at which @xmath70 flows along links @xmath72 from node @xmath22 to the out - directed nodes @xmath21 . the local rate of change @xmath73 balances in- and out - flows on a graph , as @xmath74 .",

    "the entropic protocol is governed by a vector field that is represented by a set of negative ( weighted ) divergences between local states @xmath86 and connected nodes states @xmath87 , such that @xmath88 the term `` entropic '' refers to the fact that a local vector field is an entropic quantity .",

    "the entropic protocol can be formulated as the geometric mean version of the linear consensus protocol using a coordinate transformation , with coordinate transform taken as the scalar function that leads to a least squares variational characterization of the considered mean ; for the geometric mean this is the logarithm , while for the arithmetic mean no coordinate transformation is required , see with .",
    "writing the consensus protocol in logarithmic coordinates leads for each @xmath62 to the ode @xmath93 which is the entropic protocol , as @xmath94    as we shall show , the significance of the entropic protocol arises from the situation that the asymptotically reached consensus value is given by the geometric mean of the initial condition .",

    "we introduce the scaling - invariant protocol as an instance of a novel class of network dynamics driven by pairwise metric interactions .",
    "the scaling - invariant protocol has the form of a lti consensus system however following log - linear updates ; it is given by the component ode @xmath95 this is an instance of the more general type of mean - driven network protocols given by the class @xmath96 where the metric to be chosen is the hyperbolic metric @xmath10 associated to the variational characterization of the geometric mean , see section [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "the general mean - driven equation can be motivated from a system thermodynamic viewpoint ; in @xcite a network protocol is proposed with pairwise interactions of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is locally lipschitz continuous and assumed to satisfy the condition @xmath99 , @xmath100 if @xmath101 . according to the authors this assumption implies that some sort of energy or information flows from higher to lower levels thus this condition is reminiscent of a `` second law''-like inequality in thermodynamics .",
    "we observe that this negativity hypothesis is naturally fulfilled by a metric interaction form as in : for any two states the sign of the terms @xmath102 and @xmath97 must differ .",
    "hence , for two arguments @xmath103 , @xmath98 has the sign @xmath104 .",

    "in this section we show global exponential convergence to a consensus configuration of the three network protocols driven by the geometric mean , which in summary are given by @xmath112 for protocols and we characterize the reached consensus value analytically .",
    "to study stability of fixed - points we shall make use of the logarithmic mean , its properties and the mean value theorem : the logarithmic mean of two positive real numbers @xmath113 is defined as @xmath114    the logarithmic mean is positive and symmetric in both arguments , i.e. , @xmath115 .",

    "then , we get the vector - matrix representation for the polynomial ode system , @xmath134    next we show that for positive initial conditions the flow generated by the ode system is well defined for all time : for @xmath135 , the matrix @xmath136 by definition is a laplacian matrix with finite , non - negative and real off - diagonal elements , as the branch weights are non - negative and the logarithmic mean of positive , real and finite arguments is positive , real and finite .",
    "this follows from the mean value theorem : for @xmath137 , @xmath138 , as @xmath139 is a value within the interval spanned by the positive real numbers @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the diagonal matrix @xmath142 is positive definite , as for positive initial conditions @xmath126 and @xmath127 are positive , so that @xmath143 as well , with value in between the two rates , again by the mean value theorem .",
    "hence , with positive initial condition , one can always find a lower bound @xmath144 , such that @xmath145 .",

    ", e.g. , @xcite for this monotonicity fact in consensus theory .",

    "the `` virtual '' graph associated to the dynamic laplacian @xmath151(\\cdot)$ ] is uniformly connected at each time instant for all @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the polynomial network protocol converges globally and exponentially to a consensus configuration @xmath154 , according to proposition [ prop : moreau ] .",
    "now we consider protocol and relax the constraint of balanced to arbitrary weighting of the strongly connected graph .",
    "define the matrix @xmath155 .",
    "protocol can be written as @xmath156 the matrix @xmath157 is a laplacian matrix for all parameterizations , by the same arguments as before , so that also the entropic protocol converges to a consensus configuration with exponential speed on the positive orthant .",
    "the last protocol can be written as @xmath158 which again is a linear time - varying consensus system with endogenously determined variability of the weighting .",
    "hence , the system converges to consensus with exponential speed on the positive orthant , as well .",
    "let us turn to the last statement regarding the exponentially fast reached consensus value .",
    "all three non - linear protocols can be brought to a linear consensus form on a dynamically weighted but strongly connected `` virtual '' graph . by standard linear consensus theory ,",
    "the function @xmath159 is a ( strict ) lyapunov function @xcite .",
    "hence , the maximal state value is decreasing and the minimal state value is increasing , so that the consensus value must lie in between the initial maximum and minimum state values .",
    "this proof technique is of interest in its own right : we make use of the laplacian structure arising from ( algebraic ) interconnections on a graph in shifting non - linearity associated to nodes to a non - linearity in pairwise interactions across branches , leading to a `` virtual '' dynamic graph on which the non - linear time - invariant network dynamics appears as linear time - varying consensus system .",
    "we note that the transformations in the proof of convergence do not rely on time - invariant weightings .",
    "this suggests that convergence to consensus should take place also under the weaker assumption of uniform graph connectivity .    in the following result",
    "we analytically characterize the consensus value of the entropic consensus network .",

    "next we prove that the weighted geometric mean is the consensus value . by hypothesis , @xmath170 is in the left kernel of @xmath160 , so that @xmath171 .",
