    "in metamaterials , the most general description of material properties is bianisotropic constitutive relation , which governs material responses to the electromagnetic ( em ) fields , as well as the cross terms , i.e. , magnetic ( electric ) dipoles induced by the incident electric ( magnetic ) fields .",
    "conventionally , the cross terms are hidden in the higher order spatial derivatives of the electric polarization since there is an ambiguity of splitting the induced current into polarization and magnetization in the macroscopic electromagnetics @xcite . however ,",
    "by properly selecting the ` gauge field ' for the polarization and magnetization , one is able to treat electric and magnetic fields on the same footing @xcite , thus be able to employ the duality between electric and magnetic fields to simplify the analysis significantly .",
    "it was found that most of moving media are bianisotropic by kong @xcite , who invented the concept of bianisotropy to describe the electromagnetic properties of such kind of materials .",
    "one might expect exotic behavior of em waves , or novel devices may exist @xcite , due to the extra degree of freedom from materials , i.e. , the em coupling in constituent units or the building blocks . indeed , extensive research activities , including experimental efforts @xcite and theories @xcite , have been carried out in conceiving and synthesizing bianisotropic metamaterials . as a typical sub - class of bianisotropic media , chiral media are reciprocal , and can be useful in circular dichroism spectroscopy @xcite , and polarization control . on one hand , there are considerable efforts on the fundamental level to generate chiral light , or super - chiral light from chiral or achiral photonic structures , i.e. , helix metallic structures @xcite and planar photonic lattices @xcite . on the other hand , engheta and",
    "others seek applications using chiral effects , i.e. , chirowaveguides @xcite and chiral fibers @xcite .",
    "chirowaveguides proposed by engheta are realized by filling cylindrical waveguides with isotropic chiral media , while chiral fibers are experimentally feasible with current fiber technology , i.e. , by microforming glasses or decorating glass surfaces to create helical structures .",
    "inspired by engheta s pioneering work @xcite , chirowaveguides are examined by many authors @xcite .",
    "we note that in all the aforementioned work , the chiral media are isotropic . as for light",
    ", it corresponds to a macroscopic model where chiral molecules are randomly distributed in the host , while for microwave the counterpart is the wire helices with random orientations in the host media . however , most of the available experiments in the field of chiral metamaterials @xcite suggest that it is very likely that the synthesized chiral media have strong bianisotropy . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "an efficient tool of analyzing bianisotropic waveguides is in lack in literature .    in this paper , we extend the aforementioned work on chirowaveguides to the regime where the media can be bianisotropic using a finite element approach .",
    "particularly , we study the mode properties of bianisotropic waveguides with a special emphasis on how the guided @xmath0- and @xmath1-polarized modes are impacted by bianisotropy .",
    "in contrast to engheta s findings that te and tm modes are entangled together , we found that our bianisotropic waveguides essentially function as linear polarizers .",
    "the elimination of polarization degeneracy @xcite typically refers to two effects , i.e. , birefringence and different propagation lengths of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-polarized modes .",
    "the difference between real parts of effective modal indices ( @xmath3 ) accounts for the birefringence , while different @xmath4 leads to different propagation lengths .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the geometry under investigation and give the theoretical foundation of how the finite element approach can be applied for bianisotropic waveguides . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the mode dispersion and give a coupled mode model to explain our results .",

    "bianisotropic media in principle can be realized by aligning electrically small magnetoelectric inclusions along particular directions .",

    "[ stru12](a ) .",
    "it should be noted that effective constitutive parameters of srrs and helix arrays depend on many factors such as geometric shape , lattice constant , and incident polarization @xcite .",

    ", we study bianisotropic waveguides operating at a single frequency",
    ". the dimensions of srrs or helix arrays should be far smaller than the wavelength , which implies that structure details , i.e. , geometric shapes and lattice constant of the meta - atoms , are averaged out , except the bianisotropic response built from the aligned meta - atoms . under this assumption ,",
    "applying a magnetic field along the @xmath1-direction on split ring resonators ( srrs ) will induce electrical currents flowing over the srrs along clock or anti - clock direction , which subsequently generate electric dipoles orientated along @xmath0-direction , as shown in fig .",

    "( [ 2dweak ] ) , there are a few facts and implications that we intend to discuss .",
    "firstly , eq .  ( [ 2dweak ] ) is corresponding to the functional of the reduced wave equation , and can be implemented in a truncated 2d computation domain , using standard finite element procedure .",
    "secondly , eq .  ( [ 2dweak ] ) can be turned into an eigenvalue problem , in which the propagation constant @xmath34 and the field solutions @xmath35 can be solved directly .",
    "thirdly , eq .  ( [ 2dweak ] ) is capable of handling waveguides consisting of bianisotropic materials , in either core or cladding layer , or both of them . in the following section",
    ", we will use this numerical tool to study a circularly symmetric waveguide , in which the material of the core layer is bianisotropic .",
    "further details of implementation of fem calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "starting from the simplest case , single mode cylindrical waveguides are considered in the paper . as shown in fig .",
    "[ stru12](a ) , the geometry is identical to conventional cylindrical waveguide with high material index in the core surrounded by air , except that the core layer is bianisotropic .",

    "rigourously speaking , bianisotropic parameters , permittivity and permeability are not completely independent from each other .",
    "for instance , @xmath16 of homogenous medium as well as that of magnetoelectric point scatters suffer a upper bound @xcite imposed by the magnitude of the electric and magnetic responses , i.e. , @xmath37 . in this paper",
    ", we approximate the bianisotropic parameters as independent parameters from permittivity and permeability , which may hold for the media that are off structure - resonances . without further complications , the permittivity and permeability are approximately taken as constant scalar values .",
    "figure  [ dispersion](a ) and [ dispersion](b ) show @xmath3 and @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 for three core radii .",
    "the sizes of the waveguides are chosen so that only fundamental modes with two orthogonal polarizations are supported .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath1-polarized modes keep almost unchanged , while @xmath0-polarized modes are altered significantly . in other words ,",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath0- and @xmath1-polarized modes , a commonly feature of circularly symmetric waveguides , is broken .",
    "in addition , it is clear that two orthogonally polarized modes are decoupled .",
    "such property is distinct from isotropic chiral media or chirowaveguides where @xmath0- and @xmath1-polarization are entangled together .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath0-polarized modes , @xmath3 drops while @xmath38 increases as @xmath5 increases .",
