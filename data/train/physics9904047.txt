    "this is the eighth part of our eight presentations in which we consider applications of methods from wavelet analysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems .",
    "this is a continuation of our results from [ 1]-[8 ] , in which we considered the applications of a number of analytical methods from nonlinear ( local ) fourier analysis , or wavelet analysis , to nonlinear accelerator physics problems both general and with additional structures ( hamiltonian , symplectic or quasicomplex ) , chaotic , quasiclassical , quantum .",
    "wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods , which gives us a possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and with the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases .",
    "in contrast with parts 14 in parts 58 we try to take into account before using power analytical approaches underlying algebraical , geometrical , topological structures related to kinematical , dynamical and hidden symmetry of physical problems .",
    "in section 2 we consider wavelet approach for calculation of arnold  weinstein curves ( closed loops ) in floer variational approach . in section 3",
    "we consider the applications of orbit technique for constructing different types of invariant wavelet bases in the particular case of affine galilei group with the semiproduct structure . in section 4",
    "we consider applications of very useful fast wavelet transform ( fwt ) technique ( part 6 ) to calculations in kam theory ( symplectic scale of spaces ) .",
    "this method gives maximally sparse representation of ( differential ) operator that allows us to take into account contribution from each level of resolution .",
    "now we consider the generalization of wavelet variational approach to the symplectic invariant calculation of closed loops in hamiltonian systems [ 9 ] . as we demonstrated in [ 3][4 ]",
    "we have the parametrization of our solution by some reduced algebraical problem but in contrast to the cases from parts 14 , where the solution is parametrized by construction based on scalar refinement equation , in symplectic case we have parametrization of the solution by matrix problems ",
    "quadratic mirror filters equations .",
    "now we consider a different approach .",
    "let@xmath0 ) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a closed 2-form ( nondegenerate ) on @xmath3 which induces an isomorphism @xmath4 .",
    "thus every smooth time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath5 corresponds to a time - dependent hamiltonian vector field @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 ( and @xmath10 ) is periodic in time : @xmath11 and consider corresponding hamiltonian differential equation on @xmath3 : @xmath12 the solutions @xmath13 determine a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 .",
    "these diffeomorphisms are symplectic : @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the space of contractible loops in @xmath3 which are represented by smooth curves @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 . then the contractible t - periodic solutions can be characterized as the critical points of the functional @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 be a closed unit disc and @xmath23 is a smooth function , which on boundary agrees with @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 . because [ @xmath2 ] , the cohomology class of @xmath2 , vanishes then @xmath27 is independent of choice of @xmath28 .",
    "tangent space @xmath29 is the space of vector fields @xmath30 along @xmath24 satisfying @xmath31 .",
    "then we have for the 1-form @xmath32 @xmath33 and the critical points of @xmath34 are contractible loops in @xmath35 which satisfy the hamiltonian equations .",
    "thus the critical points are precisely the required t - periodic solutions . to describe the gradient of @xmath34 we choose @xmath36 on almost complex structure on @xmath3 which is compatible with @xmath2 .",
    "this is an endomorphism @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 such that @xmath39 defines a riemannian metric on m. the hamiltonian vector field is then represented by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the gradient w.r.t .",
    "the x - variable using the metric .",
    "moreover the gradient of @xmath34 w.r.t .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath35 is given by @xmath42 .",
    "studying the critical points of @xmath34 is confronted with the well - known difficulty that the variational integral is neither bounded from below nor from above . moreover , at every possible critical point the hessian of @xmath43 has an infinite dimensional positive and an infinite dimensional negative subspaces , so the standard morse theory is not applicable .",
    "the additional problem is that the gradient vector field on the loop space @xmath35 : @xmath44 does not define a well posed cauchy problem .",
    "but floer [ 9 ] found a way to analyse the space @xmath45 of bounded solutions consisting of the critical points together with their connecting orbits .",
    "he used a combination of variational approach and gromov s elliptic technique .",
    "a gradient flow line of @xmath43 is a smooth solution @xmath46 of the partial differential equation @xmath47 which satisfies @xmath48 .",
    "the key point is to consider ( [ eq : duds ] ) not as the flow on the loop space but as an elliptic boundary value problem .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ eq : duds ] ) is a generalization of equation for gromov s pseudoholomorphic curves ( correspond to the case @xmath49 in ( [ eq : duds ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath50 the space of bounded solutions of ( [ eq : duds ] ) , i.e. the space of smooth functions @xmath51 , which are contractible , solve equation ( [ eq : duds ] ) and have finite energy flow : @xmath52 for every @xmath53 there exists a pair @xmath54 of contractible t - periodic solutions , such that @xmath28 is a connecting orbit from @xmath55 to @xmath56 : @xmath57 .",
    "then our approach from preceding parts , which we may apply or on the level of standard boundary problem or on the level of variational approach and representation of operators ( in our case , @xmath58 and @xmath41 ) according to part 6(fwt technique ) lead us to wavelet representation of closed loops .",
    "when we take into account the hamiltonian or lagrangian structures from part 7 we need to consider generalized wavelets , which allow us to consider the corresponding structures instead of compactly supported wavelet representation from parts 14 .",
    "we consider an important particular case of constructions from part 7 : affine relativity group ( relativity group combined with dilations )  affine galilei group in n - dimensions .",
    "so , we have combination of galilei group with independent space and time dilations : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is extended galilei group corresponding to mass parameter @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is noncentral extension of @xmath64 by @xmath65 , where g is usual galilei group ) .",
    "generic element of @xmath63 is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the extension parameter in @xmath61 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are the time and space translations , @xmath70 is the boost parameter , @xmath71 is a rotation and @xmath72 are time and space dilations .",
    "the actions of @xmath73 on space - time is then @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath77 acts nontrivially on @xmath61 .",
    "space - time wavelets associated to @xmath63 corresponds to unitary irreducible representation of spin zero .",
    "it may be obtained via orbit method .",
    "the hilbert space is @xmath78 , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 may be identified with usual minkowski space and we have for representation : @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "mass m is a coordinate in the dual of the lie algebra and these relations are a part of coadjoint action of @xmath63 .",
    "this representation is unitary and irreducible but not square integrable .",
    "so , we need to consider reduction to the corresponding quotients @xmath85 .",
    "we consider the case in which h=\\{phase changes @xmath86 and space dilations @xmath36}. then the space @xmath85 is parametrized by points @xmath87 .",
    "there is a dense set of vectors @xmath88 admissible @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the corresponding section .",
    "we have a two - parameter family of functions @xmath91(dilations ) : @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "then any admissible vector @xmath94 generates a tight frame of galilean wavelets @xmath95 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the simplest examples of admissible vectors ( corresponding to usual galilei case ) are gaussian vector : @xmath98 and binomial vector : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , where @xmath28 is a kind of internal energy .",
    "when we impose the relation @xmath101 then we have the restriction to the galilei - schrdinger group @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the one - dimensional subgroup of @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath104 is a natural invariance group of both the schrdinger equation and the heat equation .",
    "the restriction to @xmath104 of the representation ( 29 ) splits into the direct sum of two irreducible ones @xmath105 corresponding to the decomposition @xmath106 , where @xmath107 these two subspaces are the analogues of usual hardy spaces on @xmath65 , i.e. the subspaces of ( anti)progressive wavelets ( see also below , part iii a ) .",
    "the two representation @xmath108 are square integrable modulo the center .",
    "there is a dense set of admissible vectors @xmath94 , and each of them generates a set of @xmath109 of gilmore - perelomov type .",
    "typical wavelets of this kind are :  the schrdinger - marr wavelet : @xmath110 , the schrdinger - cauchy wavelet : @xmath111 .",
    "so , in the same way we can construct different invariant bases with explicit manifestation of underlying symmetry for solving hamiltonian or lagrangian equations .",
    "we can solve many important dynamical problems such that kam perturbations , spread of energy to higher modes , weak turbulence , growths of solutions of hamiltonian equations only if we consider scales of spaces instead of one functional space .",
    "for hamiltonian system and their perturbations for which we need take into account underlying symplectic structure we need to consider symplectic scales of spaces .",
    "so , if @xmath112 is hamiltonian equation we need wavelet description of symplectic or quasicomplex structure on the level of functional spaces .",
    "it is very important that according to [ 12 ] hilbert basis is in the same time a darboux basis to corresponding symplectic structure .",
    "we need to provide hilbert scale @xmath113 with symplectic structure [ 12 ] .",
    "all what we need is the following .",
    "@xmath58 is a linear operator , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath58 determines an isomorphism of scale @xmath113 of order @xmath117 .",
    "the operator @xmath58 with domain of definition @xmath118 is antisymmetric in @xmath119 : @xmath120 @xmath121",
    ". then the triple @xmath122 is symplectic hilbert scale .",
    "so , we may consider any dynamical hamiltonian problem on functional level .",
    "as an example , for kdv equation we have @xmath123 @xmath124 is isomorphism of the scale of order one , @xmath125 is isomorphism of order @xmath126 .",
    "according to [ 13 ] general functional spaces and scales of spaces such as holder  zygmund , triebel  lizorkin and sobolev can be characterized through wavelet coefficients or wavelet transforms . as a rule , the faster the wavelet coefficients decay , the more the analyzed function is regular [ 13 ] . most important for us example is the scale of sobolev spaces .",
    "let @xmath127 is the hilbert space of all distributions with finite norm @xmath128 let us consider wavelet transform @xmath129 @xmath130 , w.r.t . analyzing wavelet @xmath73 , which is strictly admissible , i.e.",
    "@xmath131 then there is a @xmath132 such that @xmath133 this shows that localization of the wavelet coefficients at small scale is linked to local regularity .",
    "so , we need representation for differential operator ( @xmath58 in our case ) in wavelet basis . we consider it by means of the methods from part 6 .",
