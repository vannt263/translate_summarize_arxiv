    "in particular , since d. sullivan showed the famous `` no wandering domain theorem '' using teichmller theory in the 1980s , this subject has attracted many researchers from a wide area . for a general reference on complex dynamical systems ,",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of polynomial semigroups ( semigroups generated by a family of polynomial maps on the riemann sphere @xmath0 ) and the random dynamics of polynomials on the riemann sphere . combining the dynamics of semigroups and the fiberwise ( random ) dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we give a classification of polynomial semigroups @xmath1 such that @xmath1 is generated by a compact family @xmath2 , the planar postcritical set of @xmath1 is bounded , and @xmath1 is ( semi- ) hyperbolic . in one of the classes , we have that for almost every sequence @xmath3 , the julia set @xmath4 of @xmath5 is a jordan curve but not a quasicircle , the unbounded component of @xmath6 is a john domain , and the bounded component of @xmath7 is not a john domain . note that this phenomenon does not hold in the usual iteration of a single polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we consider the dynamics of polynomial semigroups @xmath1 such that the planar postcritical set of @xmath1 is bounded and the julia set is disconnected . those phenomena of polynomial semigroups and random dynamics of polynomials that do not occur in the usual dynamics of polynomials are systematically investigated . </S>"
