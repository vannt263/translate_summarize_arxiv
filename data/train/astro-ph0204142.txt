    "wx ceti is a member of the tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae ( toad ) class of cataclysmic variable ( cv ) , with close relatives being systems such as wz sge , vy aqr , and tv crv . these  wz sge \" stars are distinguished by their properties of 1 ) large amplitude ( @xmath3 6 mag ) superoutbursts ( with most toads never having normal dwarf novae type outbursts ) , 2 ) periodic photometric signatures during superoutburst termed superhumps which begin days after maximum and establish the orbital period of the binary to within a few per cent , and 3 ) mass donors that are likely to be sub - stellar ( i.e. , @xmath40.06 m@xmath5 ) . see howell & skidmore ( 2000 ) for a brief review of the toads .",
    "one of the most important properties to measure for a cv is its orbital period .",
    "photometric observations made during superoutburst offer a means to estimate p@xmath6 for cvs which may otherwise be too faint for , or as yet have no detailed spectroscopic study . for wx cet , kato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used photometric observations of wx cet during superoutburst to determine the superhump period at 0.@xmath705949 .",
    "this superhump period is 2.1% longer than the orbital period for wx cet ( p@xmath6=0.@xmath705827 ) ( rogoziecki & schwarzenberg - czerny 2001 ) determined using minimum light observations .",
    "this period difference is typical of cvs which show superhumps as it measures the difference between the eccentric superoutbursting accretion disk and the true orbital period and is related to the cv mass ratio ( warner 1996 ) .",
    "howell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that multi-@xmath8 superoutburst data for four toads and three other cvs can be explained by a  two - temperature \" model , from which the temperatures of the inner accretion disk and boundary layer can be estimated .    in this paper",
    ", we present our observations of wx cet during its november 1998 superoutburst .",
    "our measured superhump period agrees with the better defined one by kato et al ( 2001 ) and our multi - color optical time - series light curves confirm that superhumps are grey in the optical .",
    "using the determined colors and fitting the optical data , we estimate the temperature of the inner accretion disk and adding in the euv photometry , we estimate the boundary layer temperature as well .",
    "wx cet went into superoutburst on 1998 november 10 ut . during this superoutburst ,",
    "wx cet reached a maximum v magnitude of @xmath011.8 as estimated by the aavso observers ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the observational coverage of the maximum ended near 25 november 1998 . on figure 1",
    "we show the times of our other observations described below .",
    "optical photometry , in johnson @xmath9 filters , was obtained at braeside observatory ( bo ) in flagstaff , arizona on 1998 november 14 - 17 ut . the braeside telescope is a 0.4-m cassegrain reflector and used a loral 422 ccd as the detector for these observations .",
    "all nights were photometric and the exposure times were 45 s ( @xmath10 & @xmath11 ) , 25 s ( @xmath12 ) , and 20 s ( @xmath13 & @xmath14 ) for each night with typical 1@xmath15 differential magnitude errors of 0.005 mag or less as determined through use of the statistical tests presented in howell et al .",
    "the primary comparison star was located about 1 arc min se of wx cet . using the usno and hst guide star catalogues",
    ", we can estimate the spectral type of this comparison star ( f2v ) and its optical magnitudes : u=10.83 , b=10.80 , v=10.50 , r=10.20 , i=10.03 .",
    "the bo multi - color observations were taken in a cyclic manner , @xmath16 on the 14th and @xmath9 on the remaining nights .",
    "figure 2(a - d ) shows the four nights of optical photometry . we have used the comparison star magnitudes to place the differential values on an absolute scale with estimated uncertainties of @xmath170.1 mag .",
    "the superhumps observed in each color show a variety of shapes and amplitudes when examined in detail .",
    "the shape in all cases is non - sinusoidal and changes within a single color in a single night are common .",
    "measurement of the trough - to - peak amplitude of the superhumps shows a slightly larger amplitude towards the red ( @xmath18=0.11 mag : @xmath19=0.17 mag ) and a slight overall decrease in amplitude from the 14th to the 17th .",
    "some of the superhumps , such as those on the night of the 16th , show secondary humps similar to , but not as pronounced as those seen in tv crv ( howell et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "wx cet was observed by the _",
    "euve _ satellite from 12 to 15 november 1998 ut .",
    "wx cet was a faint target for _ euve _ so only imaging observations are usable .",
    "the euv imager ( sirk et al . 1997 ) covers approximately 70 - 120    with a central wavelength of @xmath091 .",
    "the _ euve _ observations extended for 3.5 days with a total on - source exposure time of 67378 s at a mean count rate of @xmath00.005 cts / sec .",
    "photon event lists ( x , y , t ) produced from the euv imager were used these to perform aperture photometry on the wx cet data . due to the low count rate",
    "the data were summed into 0.03 day time bins ( approximately one - half of the wx cet orbital period ) in order to provide reasonable statistics .",
    "in contrast to the case of t leo ( howell et al . 1999 ) , the euv light curve of wx cet , shown in figure 3 , appears unmodulated . phasing these data on wx cet s",
    "orbital and superhump periods also showed no modulation .",
    "the euv count rate observed for wx cet corresponds to an observed flux of 6.23 @xmath20 10@xmath21 ergs / sec/@xmath22/  over the wavelength range 70 - 120  ( see sirk et al .",
    "wx cet has no published distance estimate , however using the sproats et al .",
    "( 1996 ) relation between superoutburst amplitude and m@xmath23 at minimum and wx cet s v@xmath24=17.6 , we can determine that m@xmath23(min)@xmath011.5 - 12.5 .",
    "this range suggests a distance to wx cet of 130@xmath1730 pc . searching the _ euve _ data archive for sources near wx cet we find four main sequence stars close in location ( 1.2 to 1.6 degrees ) and distance ( 105 - 190 pc ) which have estimated values of their line - of - sight ism column density ( n@xmath25 ) .",
    "the range of the column density values towards wx cet as determined by the ism indicator stars is 20.04 @xmath4log n@xmath25 @xmath420.41 .",
    "calculation of the optical depth at 100   yields @xmath26=3 to 7 ( ism through - puts of 0.05 to 0.0009 ) , giving corrected wx cet euv fluxes of 1.3 @xmath20 10@xmath27 to 6.9 @xmath20",
    "10@xmath28 ergs / sec/@xmath22/ .",
    "a spectrum of wx cet was obtained on 14 november 1998 17:10 ut , closely following outburst maximum .",
    "the observations made use of the steward observatory 2.3  m bok telescope and ccd spectropolarimeter ( schmidt , stockman , & smith 1992 ) in a non - polarimetric configuration .",
    "the data cover the @xmath29  region at a 3-pixel resolution of 12 , and show a steep blue continuum with broad balmer and he  i @xmath30 absorption lines , all with weak emission cores ( figure 4 ) .",
    "optical magnitudes were estimated by numerically convolving the spectral data with the johnson filter pass - bands , and yield the results : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "these are consistent with , but about 0.1  mag fainter across the board , than our contemporaneous bo multi - color photometry , a likely result of slit losses at the spectrograph .",
    "half - widths of the absorption lines measure @xmath34 km  sec@xmath35 , while the emission cores are resolved at @xmath0900 km  sec@xmath35 .",
    "line strengths of the cores show a significantly flatter balmer decrement than optically thin recombination , suggesting that they are formed , at least in part , in an optically thick gas .",
    "since the continuum and the lines an the accretion disk at outburst are both believed to be optically thick ( i.e. , leading to weak balmer absorption ) , we suggest that the emission cores are formed in or near the boundary layer in a region that is thick in the lines but thin in the continuum .",
    "optical spectroscopy was also obtained by us on the 13th and 23rd of november 1998 ut .",
    "these spectra were obtained using the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope and double imaging spectrograph with a 1.5 arcsec slit .",
    "the apo spectrum obtained on the 13th is similar to that obtained on the 14th as discussed above .",
    "the spectra from the 23rd are shown in figure 5 revealing only h@xmath36 in emission and a rising blue continuum .",
    "these spectra show that wx cet still contained an optically thick accretion disk even at 13 days past maximum light .",
    "our 4 nights of optical photometry allow an estimate of the superhump period of wx cet .",
    "three  methods \" were used ; ( 1 ) performing period searching ( using the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) routine ( stellingwerf 1978 ) ) on each data set separately , each combined color dataset , and the total color - combined dataset , ( 2 ) each dataset with multiple humps was phased on all the likely periods found in ( 1 ) , and ( 3 ) using each dataset with multiple humps , we simply measured the period between the humps .",
    "the non - sinusoidal , varying amplitude and shape of the superhumps as well as our limited time coverage did not allow us to determine a highly precise value for the superhump period . additionally , we found no period differences in any of the different color datasets on any of the nights .",
    "our 1200 measurements provided a best fit superhump period of 16.786@xmath170.1 cycles / day or 0.059 days ( 85.79 min ) .",
    "this period is in agreement with the much better determined value of 0.05949(1 ) days from kato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .      in order to look for any color effects in the amplitude and shape of the superhumps",
    ", we produced light curves for the colors @xmath37 .",
    "figure 6 shows the results with the top plot displaying the simultaneous @xmath13 light curve for comparison .",
    "the night of the 16th seems to show some possible color dependence in @xmath10 and @xmath11 related to the superhumps , but this effect is not seen in the data from the 15th ( fig .",
    "6a ) or the 17th ( not shown ) . the curves in fig . 6",
    "show that within the uncertainties of our measurements , the superhumps appear to be grey over the optical region of the spectrum .",
    "our observed colors are consistent with those observed during the 1989 superoutburst of wx cet by odonoghue et al .",
    "( 1991 ) even though that superoutburst reached a maximum brightness one magnitude brighter than the one under study here .",
    "assuming an optically thick source , the measured colors for wx cet correspond to a color temperature of @xmath38 = 18,000k , @xmath39 & @xmath40 = 21,000k and @xmath41 = 25,000k and we assume this emission represents the accretion disk during superoutburst .",
    "only a few short - period cvs have been observed in the euv during superoutburst ( mauche 2002 ) and only two toads ; t leo ( howell et al .",
    "1999 ) and wx cet .",
    "thus , the observation of wx cet in the euv provides an unusual opportunity to determine the temperature of the inner accretion disk regions .",
    "howell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that using optical ( and uv ) data alone , the temperature of the cooler inner accretion disk region can be approximated by a single blackbody , while shorter wavelength observations allow the boundary layer ( i.e. , the accretion disk  white dwarf interface ) temperature to be determined .",
    "in general , the two temperatures differ by @xmath00.5 dex for short period cvs with the boundary layer temperatures being near 80,000k during superoutburst .    using seven cvs observed during ( super)outburst , howell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) developed a model for the temperatures present in the inner accretion disk and at the boundary layer ( bl ) for cvs , essentially showing that both temperatures decline with orbital period : the toad s inner accretion disk temperature falling more rapidly than other short period cvs .",
    "the cooler inner accretion disk temperatures for the toads are taken to be indicative of an initial ( pre - superoutburst ) accretion disk with a optically thin or altogether absent inner accretion disk . using the model developed in howell et al .",
    ", we calculate the expected inner disk and boundary layer superoutburst temperatures for wx cet .",
    "figure 7 presents the optical ( @xmath9 ) and euv photometric points for wx cet for the mid-_euve _ observation time , hjd 2451133 .",
    "the range for the euv photometry is that allowed by the range in estimated ism column density to wx cet with the  star \" symbol representing the probable value for the euv flux ( 2.51 @xmath20 10@xmath27 ergs / sec/@xmath22/ ) based on the expected ism column at a distance of 130 pc ( log n@xmath25 = -13.6 ) . the inner accretion disk temperature in wx cet ,  observed \" by optical ( and uv ) measurements ,",
    "is predicted ( using howell et al .",
    "1999 ) to be 21,000k .",
    "we already noted that the optical colors suggest a temperature near 21,000k , in agreement with that expected from the howell et al . model . in fig .",
    "7 we plot a 21,000k blackbody curve ( dotted line ) which fits the optical data fairly well .",
    "the bo @xmath10 filter is non - standard and its calibration uncertainty may account for the @xmath10 flux not agreeing with the model fit . a much cooler accretion disk , produced to fit @xmath10 as well as the redder colors , would have to be larger than the entire binary to produce the needed flux based on our distance estimate .",
    "we also see that the 21,000k blackbody curve falls short of fitting the euv photometric point , a result found for all cvs by howell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    to estimate the boundary layer temperature expected for wx cet during superoutburst",
    ", we again use the model in howell et al . and calculate a value of t@xmath2=72,500k for wx cet .",
    "we plot the blackbody approximation to the boundary layer in fig .",
    "7 . to scale the two blackbody curves in fig .",
    "7 we proceeded as follows .",
    "observational determinations of the extent of the boundary layer during outburst generally show it to have an emitting area similar in size to that of the white dwarf ( see howell et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical arguments agree , suggesting that the bl may be an equatorial belt around the wd or through viscous spreading , it may cover a large part of the wd surface ( e.g. , kutter & sparks 1989 ) . given these estimates , we have taken the boundary layer in wx cet during superoutburst to have a size which is approximately that of the white dwarf .",
    "we have also assumed a 0.6 m@xmath5 white dwarf ( see szkody et al .",
    "2002 ) with a radius of 8 @xmath20 10@xmath42 cm .    using the t@xmath2 fit with the assumption that r@xmath43r@xmath44 and using its best scaled fit to the optical data , our blackbody model yields a distance to wx cet of 120 pc , close to our original estimate . scaling the blackbody approximation of the inner accretion disk such that the sum of the two curves provides a  by eye \" best fit to the optical data , we find that the ratio of the two ( assumed uniform ) emitting areas has a value of 6.3 . transforming this scaling into an emitting area , we find an inner disk radius of 2 @xmath20 10@xmath45 cm or 2.5 r@xmath44 . given the range in ism column ,",
    "temperatures of 68,000k to 90,000k are strictly allowed for the boundary layer , however a value of 70,000k is the  best fit \" to the most likely value for the euv flux from wx cet and temperatures higher than 78,000k are inconsistent with the optical data and the assumed white dwarf properties .",
    "we note here that it is unlikely that the boundary layer can be adequately fit by a single blackbody .",
    "the assumptions of a single temperature , uniformly emitting , optically thick boundary layer are likely to be overly simplistic but given the data in hand , more detailed modelling is not possible . our value for t@xmath2",
    "should thus be taken to represent an approximation only .",
    "our multi - color optical and euv photometric observations were used to estimate the superhump period of wx cet and to show that the humps are color independent . our superhump period ( 0.059 d )",
    "agrees with the better determined value presented in kato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . using simultaneous euv and optical observations",
    ", we fit them with a  two - temperature \" ( super)outburst model developed by howell et al .",
    "the results indicate that during the peak of the superoutburst , wx cet had a boundary layer temperature near 72,500k and an inner accretion disk radius of 2.5 r@xmath44 with a temperature near 21,000k .",
    "the above results for wx cet ( and their general agreement with those of t leo and other short orbital period dwarf novae ) , allow us to provide an estimation of the state of the accretion disk during superoutburst in a low mass transfer dwarf novae ( toad ) . the inner disk radius , being larger than that of the white dwarf , implies that in between the optically thick inner disk and the white dwarf surface there will be a rareified region probably at high temperature .",
    "while the boundary layer temperature is @xmath02 - 4 times less in the toads than in longer period dwarf novae ( which have higher accretion rates and likely higher mass primaries ; see howell et al .",
    "1999 ) , the amount of material accreting onto the white dwarf is considerably less ( @xmath05 times less ; howell et al .",
    "therefore , the hot boundary layer can form an optically thin region ( @xmath0strgrem sphere ) near the white dwarf which would then be a source of coronal emission .",
    "in fact , a 60 - 160  _ chandra _ spectrum taken during the recent superoutburst of the toad wz sge ( kuulkers et al .",
    "2002 ) showed just this type of coronal spectrum : a forest of narrow , bright emission lines with no continuum .",
    "wx cet and t leo are the only toads yet observed in the euv during superoutburst and we see that the model developed for the inner disk and boundary layer temperatures appear to work , at least for these two systems .",
    "observation of wz sge was the first x - ray spectrum of a toad obtained during superoutburst .",
    "future euv - x - ray observations of toads during superoutburst are needed in order to provide additional observational tests of the proposed model .",
