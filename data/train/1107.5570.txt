    "however , shocks and winds from star - forming regions are ill suited to produce such coherent and large scale gas outflows , even ignoring inhomogeneities in the disk ( e.g. , spiral arms and hi holes ) that would work against the formation of narrow hi rings .",
    "the low @xmath349 encircled disks present another problem : where did all the gas go ?",
    "conversion into stars would require essentially @xmath506  sfe on @xmath507 myr timescales , which is clearly unfeasible .",
    "second , analysis of the cartwheel s hi kinematics found large - scale gas inflows plus an @xmath104solid - body rotation curve @xcite . while the forest fire interpretation makes no clear kinematic predictions , it is not obvious how a propagating starburst would result in these bulk motions .",
    "third , differential rotation will distort and eventually destroy the symmetry of a self - propagating starburst unless it was perfectly centered , i.e. , unless the intruder passed through the exact center of the target disk .",
    "an analogy can be made with the evolution of hi holes in spiral disks , created by expanding superbubbles of hot gas from sne blasts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the holes grow they are invariably distorted by shear .",
    "one would therefore predict that large off - centered ring galaxies would have highly distorted rings .",
    "the opposite is true : the three largest ring galaxies - am0644 - 741 , the cartwheel , and the `` sacred mushroom '' - all have highly symmetric rings , even the two formed in a markedly off - centered collision .",
    "if the rings are just propagating hii region fronts , one would expect that preexisting stellar structures like spiral arms and bars to survive , and in fact , made more obvious in optical images . on the contrary ,",
    "apart from the cartwheel s spokes , no other ring galaxy shows obvious spiral arms .",
    "finally , roughly @xmath508 of spirals in the local universe with @xmath509 log@xmath510 possess starburst nuclei , representing a space density @xmath511 mpc@xmath512 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "stellar structures in the disk ( e.g. , pre - collision spiral arms ) are effectively erased as their orbits are crowded and phase mixed in the expanding ring .",
    "ring galaxies are rare simply because they require a low probability event - a low impact - parameter collision with a companion .",
    "stochastic effects undoubtedly play a role in these systems .",
    "however , the weight of evidence argues that they must be secondary to the ability of the ring density wave to concentrate a disk s stellar and gaseous components into a dense environment for the action of gravitational instabilities .",
    "ring galaxies are unique systems in which to study the triggering and regulation of massive star formation on large scales . in this paper",
    "we examine one of the best examples , am0644 - 741 , which is notable for its large diameter ring ( @xmath0 kpc ) , inferred age ( @xmath514 myr ) , and global sfr . from the analysis of h@xmath18 , fuv , infrared , and radio continuum images we conclude that sfr@xmath515 @xmath15 yr@xmath16 , with relatively low internal extinction ( @xmath516 ) , and no significant star formation within the encircled disk or nucleus .",
    "analysis of optical spectra show that am0644 - 741 s ring possesses @xmath406solar metal abundances ( in marked contrast with its `` twin '' the cartwheel ) , opening the possibility of characterizing its molecular ism using rotational transitions of @xmath12co .",
    "the distribution of hii complexes gives the appearance of the classic `` beads on a string '' morphology , which is a hallmark of star formation triggered by the action of large scale gravitational instabilities .",
    "one therefore expects @xmath5 throughout the ring .",
    "observations using atca and sest show that essentially all of am0644 - 741 s neutral ism is concentrated in the expanding @xmath0 kpc diameter ring , which agrees both with collisional models and high resolution observations of other ring galaxies ( e.g. , arp  143 and the cartwheel ) .",
    "contrary to our expectations , we find the ring s global molecular fraction to be surprisingly small ( @xmath517 ) , particularly given that sa - sb galaxies , the likely progenitor of am0644 - 741 , normally possess comparable amounts of hi and h@xmath6 .",
    "it is this apparent deficiency of h@xmath6 that is responsible for the ring s other peculiar properties : elevated sfe , a star formation law where atomic gas - but not molecular gas - correlates with star formation , and typically @xmath518 .",
    "the concentration of the disk s ism into the dense ring appears to have not generated a molecular rich environment .",
    "quite to the contrary , applying pdr models to the observed @xmath20 , @xmath247 , and @xmath413 yield wnm - like total hydrogen volume densities ( @xmath519 @xmath8 ) throughout the ring quadrant experiencing peak sfr .",
    "our data allow us to reject the possibility that the ring s apparently small molecular component is the result of low and/or variable metallicity , unusually high @xmath413 , or insufficient pressure ( which regulates the conversion of hi to h@xmath6 ) .",
    "we find the opposite to be true : am0644 - 741 s ring would have been expected to be dominated by molecular gas given our estimates of its @xmath407 and @xmath413 .",
    "to explain how am0644 - 741 can form stars in a wnm dominated ism , we propose that the rings in evolved and robustly star - forming ring galaxies like am0644 - 741 and the cartwheel possess an `` over - cooked '' ism , where gmcs are fragmented and photodissociated by prolonged exposure to sne shocks , expanding hii regions , and moderately high @xmath413 ( @xmath520 ) during their @xmath484 myr confinement to the ring .",
    "consequently , co survives only in the small innermost cloud cores due to reduced shielding available in the cloud fragments , and traces h@xmath6 differently than for a galactic cloud .",
    "in particular , @xmath12co transitions will significantly _ underestimate _ the amount of h@xmath6 in the ring in a way that depends on the local sfr density .",
    "an `` over - cooked '' ism can thus account for the unusually high sfe , the small @xmath1 and its variations around the ring , as well as the peculiar star formation law , where co appears to be decoupled from local star formation .",
    "this also explains the observed linear relationship between @xmath344 and @xmath20 : the abundant atomic gas we detect with the atca is primarily a photodissociation product , which traces rather than fuels star formation .",
    "it is no longer surprising , then , that this component will resemble the wnm . for all practical purposes ,",
    "it is the wnm .",
    "if , as we suspect , @xmath12co significantly underestimates the ring s molecular component , then @xmath391 may be significantly overestimated .",
    "if the h@xmath6 obeys an m51-like schmidt law ( e.g. , k07 ) , then we find that @xmath471 is satisfied for nearly all of the ring , and in particular , where massive star formation is observed to be robust .",
    "gravitational instabilities then become the dominant star formation trigger .",
    "independent estimates of the ring s molecular component , as well as better constraints on the stellar velocity dispersion , are clearly needed to conclusively settle this point .",
    "another peculiar aspect of am0644 - 741 s ism , and one not evident in the cartwheel , is the wide and multi - component line profiles , both in the atomic and molecular gas .",
    "it is not clear at present if this reflects caustics in the gas flow or out - of - plane motions , though preliminary @xmath32-body simulations appear to favor the former interpretation ( j. wallin , private communication ) .",
    "our results imply that the rings of systems like am0644 - 741 and the cartwheel represent substantially different star - forming environments than that typically found in spiral arms due to the sustained accumulation of damage to the ism from concentrated populations of ob stars . at the same time , the modest fuv radiation fields mean that they are still different from intense nuclear starbursts and ulirgs .",
    "ring galaxies remain interesting and valuable systems to study the interaction between the ism and intense star formation , and follow - up observations with @xmath485 and alma , in addition to models incorporating more sophisticated treatments of the ism , are clearly warranted .",
    "finally , we examined the `` forest fire '' interpretation of ring galaxies in light of these ( and previous ) observational results .",
    "we argue that a propagating starburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not reproduce the observed gas distribution or large - scale kinematics of ring galaxies . likewise , the space density of nuclear starburst galaxies , i.e. , systems possessing the forest fire `` detonator '' , is @xmath521 times larger than that of ring galaxies , implying that if ring galaxies arise this way , they should be much more common .",
