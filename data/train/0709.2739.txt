    "thus , it has been established that a majority of main - sequence stars consist of binary or multiple systems . between multiples , the fraction of binary ( b ) , triple ( t ) , and higher - order multiple ( h ) systems is b : t : h = 0.75 : 0.175 : 0.04 @xcite , which indicates that binary systems account for a large percentage of these systems @xcite .",
    "observations of star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the multiplicity of pre - main sequence stars is larger than that of main - sequence stars .",
    "for example , in the taurus star - forming region , it is expected that almost 100% of pre - main sequence stars are members of binary or multiple systems @xcite .",
    "recently , extremely young protostars ( i.e. , class 0 protostars ) have been observable with radio interferometer @xcite and wide - field near - infrared cameras @xcite .",
    "these observations have shown that stars already have a high multiplicity at the moment of their birth .",
    "in contrast , @xcite pointed out that the multiplicity of low mass main - sequence stars ( @xmath6 ) is less than @xmath7 50% .",
    "the multiplicity of the field stars tends to decrease with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "@xcite denoted that the multiple system decays by dynamical disruptive interaction in a short timescale ( @xmath8myr ) , and these systems evolve into an ejected single star or stable binary system .",
    "this mechanism is effective in multiple systems composed of lower mass stars , because the binding energy of these systems is small .",
    "thus , it is considered that stars are born as binary or multiple systems , and some systems disrupt into single stars as time goes on .",
    "for this reason , binary and multiple frequencies decrease with time , especially in low - mass systems .",
    "distribution of binary separation is known to be very wide ( @xmath9au@xmath10au ) and flat , usually modeled as a lognormal with a mean @xmath11au @xcite . for field",
    "main - sequence stars , roughly a third of all companions have close separation ( @xmath12au ) .",
    "in addition , some binary systems have rotation periods of @xmath13days , which corresponds to @xmath14au of the separation when the total mass of 1 @xmath15 is assumed @xcite , and they are classified as close binary.au as close binary , while the binary system with separation of @xmath16au as wide binary . ]",
    "these are the same for stars in the star - forming region .",
    "@xcite showed that the binary separation extends from 0.01au up to 1000au also in pre - main sequence stars .",
    "this indicates that both wide and close binary systems are formed in the star - formation process .",
    "however , the mechanism that determines the binary frequency and separation is still unknown .",
    "the frequency and separation distributions of binary are important clues to understanding the formation process of such stars .",
    "it is , however , difficult to observe the formation process of binary systems directly , because these systems are embedded in dense gas clouds , and star ( or binary ) formation timescales are expected to be extremely short .",
    "thus , numerical calculations are necessary to understand the binary formation process including binary frequency and separation distributions .    under the spherical symmetry",
    ", @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite numerically investigated the evolution of a cloud from the molecular cloud core stage to that of protostar formation including the detailed radiative transfer .",
    "they found that the gas cloud collapses self - similarly to reach stellar density . according to the thermal evolution derived in their studies , cloud evolution",
    "is divided into four phases : the isothermal ( @xmath17 ) , adiabatic ( @xmath18 ) , second collapse ( @xmath19 ) , and protostar formation phases ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 means the number density at the center of the cloud .",
    "the cloud collapses isothermally for @xmath17 ( the isothermal phase or first collapse phase ) , then the gas around the center of the cloud becomes optically thick and collapses adiabatically after the central density exceeds @xmath22 ( the adiabatic phase ) . in the adiabatic phase , the adiabatic core ( or the first core ) surrounded by a shock is formed .",
    "when the central density reaches @xmath23 , the molecular hydrogen begins to dissociate and the cloud collapses rapidly ( the second collapse phase ) .",
    "after the molecular hydrogen is completely dissociated , the gas collapses adiabatically again and the protostar ( or second core ) is formed at @xmath24 . in these spherically symmetric calculations , however , cloud fragmentation or binary formation can not be investigated , because these calculations only include the isotropic forces of the gravity and thermal pressure .",
    "cloud fragmentation is controlled by the anisotropic forces caused by the cloud rotation , magnetic field , and turbulence .",
    "thus , to investigate the fragmentation of the cloud , three - dimensional calculations are needed .",
    "the evolution of rotating clouds in three dimensions have been investigated by many authors ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , and @xcite calculated the evolutions of spherical clouds with initially uniform density and rigid - body rotation law in the isothermal regime .",

    "when fragmentation occurs in the isothermal phase , the separation of the fragments has a scale of @xmath28au , which corresponds to the jeans length in this phase .",

    "@xcite observed 179 cores in the star - forming regions , and showed that many of the cores are nearly in virial equilibrium .",
    "namely , their observations indicate that @xmath30 is not so small , but is close to @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite . ] for this reason , it is expected that fragmentation rarely occurs in the isothermal phase .",
    "the evolution of rotating clouds with centrally condensed density profiles from the isothermal to the adiabatic phase are investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that cloud rotation promotes fragmentation in the adiabatic phase .",
    "@xcite showed that fragmentation occurs in the adiabatic phase when the cloud core has a rotation energy of @xmath32 , which is sufficiently smaller than the observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the molecular clouds have @xmath33 with the mean value of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , their results indicate that the major fraction of molecular clouds might fragment in the adiabatic phase .",
    "many observations have shown that cloud cores have a significant non - thermal motion , which can be attributed to turbulence .",
    "the turbulence is thought to dissipate as a cloud collapses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the very early phase of cloud collapse",
    ", however , the cloud acquires the angular momentum from turbulence , besides the large - scale ordered rotation motion of the host cloud .",
    "thus , turbulence promotes fragmentation , as for the cloud rotation .",
    "numerical studies have shown that more fragments appear in a cloud with larger turbulent energy in the initial state @xcite . the cloud evolution with larger turbulent energy , in which an initial cloud has turbulent energy comparable to the gravitational ,",
    "is investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in their calculations ,",
    "fragmentation frequently occurs in an isolated cloud core , and many binary or multiple systems appear .",
    "@xcite calculated the evolution of clouds with smaller turbulent energy .",
    "they found fragmentation occurs and a binary system is born when the initial cloud has @xmath35 turbulence energy exceeding gravitational energy .",
    "they have suggested that almost all stars are born as binary or multiple systems , even if a cloud core has a low level of turbulence .",
    "however , binary frequencies found in these turbulence calculations are higher than in observations .",
    "since the magnetic fields were ignored in these calculations , these high binary frequencies may be caused by neglect of the magnetic effect .",
    "while cloud rotation and turbulence promote fragmentation , the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation .",
    "the evolution of magnetized clouds from the isothermal to the adiabatic phase is investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in their studies ,",
    "fragmentation rarely occurs in strongly magnetized clouds .",
    "this is because the angular momentum , which promotes fragmentation , is removed by the magnetic effect ( e.g. , magnetic braking , outflow , and jets ) .",
    "@xcite showed that fragmentation depends only on the ratio of angular rotation speed to the magnetic field strength of the initial clouds , and hence it is necessary for strongly magnetized clouds to rotate rapidly for fragmentation .",
    "although fragmentation processes in the isothermal and adiabatic phase ( @xmath36 ) are investigated by many authors , there are few studies of fragmentation in the second collapse and protostellar phases ( @xmath37 ) . when fragmentation occurs in the isothermal or adiabatic phases ( @xmath38 )",
    ", fragments have separations of @xmath39au , which correspond to the jeans length in these phases .",
    "fragments formed in these phases are expected to evolve into wide binary systems , when the binary systems maintain separation at their formation epoch .",
    "however , about 20 - 30% of observed binaries have separations of @xmath40au @xcite . in the collapsing cloud ,",
    "the jeans length becomes @xmath41 au after the central density exceeds @xmath42 .",
    "thus , fragments with the separation of @xmath40au and thus close binary systems are expected when fragmentation occurs for @xmath43 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution of unmagnetized clouds from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . according to their calculations",
    ", fragmentation does not occur in the high - density region , because the non - axisymmetric structure which appears in the adiabatic stage effectively removes angular momentum from the center of the cloud .",
    "thus , they concluded that fragmentation does not occur for @xmath46 .",
    "however , they investigated the cloud evolution in a few parameters .",
    "@xcite pointed out that cloud evolution in high - density gas is complicated , hence a large number of calculations and a statistical approach are needed to understand the fragmentation process .",
    "@xcite investigated the cloud evolution of magnetized clouds for @xmath47 , and found that fragmentation occurs in the high density gas via a ring structure .",
    "they expected that this ring structure evolves into a close binary with the separation of @xmath48 .",
    "however , they adopted the ideal mhd approximation , which is not valid in high - density gas as @xmath49 .",
    "a significant magnetic flux is lost by ohmic dissipation in the density range of @xmath50 @xcite and hence they overestimated the magnetic flux in a collapsing cloud , especially in the high - density gas regions .",
    "in addition , they investigated the cloud evolution with only one parameter .    in this study , we investigate the evolutions of magnetized cloud cores ( @xmath51 , @xmath52au ) until a protostar is formed ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) using three - dimensional resistive mhd nested grid simulations .",
    "we calculated 147 models with different magnetic field strengths , rotation speeds , and initial amplitudes of non - axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "we found that the formation conditions for close and wide binary systems are related to the ratio of the rotational to the magnetic energy of the cloud core .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : the framework of our models is given in  2 and in  3 the numerical method of our computations is shown .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ) and @xmath136 ( fig.[fig:4 ] ) .",
    "firstly , we compare the models having the same parameters of ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 ) = ( 0.001 , 0.07 ) , which are located in the third row and the second column in figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:4 ] , and [ fig:6 ] .",

    "@xcite showed that the spiral structure effectively removes the angular momentum from the center of the cloud , and a single protostar is directly formed without fragmentation .",
    "also in this model , since the angular momentum is effectively removed owing to the bar or spiral structure , the protostar is thought to form without fragmentation .",
    "next , we describe the models with ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 ) = ( 0.001 , 0.05 ) , and ( 0.01 , 0.05 ) , which are located at the fourth row and the second and third columns",
    ". figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:4 ] , and [ fig:6 ] show that fragmentation occurs in the adiabatic phase with wide separations ( @xmath231au ) for the models with @xmath135 and @xmath232 , while fragmentation occurs with a narrow separation ( @xmath233au ) in the second collapse or protostellar phase for the models with @xmath136 . according to the degree of non - axisymmetric pattern ( i.e. , the axis ratio ) , these models experience three different types of evolutions : ( i )",
    "if the core has a small axis ratio , fragmentation occurs via a ring - like structure in the adiabatic phase owing to the rapid rotation ( @xmath135 ) , ( ii ) if the core has a moderate axis ratio , fragmentation occurs in the second collapse phase , because the angular momentum is effectively removed by the bar - like structure in the adiabatic phase ( @xmath136 ) , and ( iii ) if the core has a large axis ratio , fragmentation occurs via a bar - like structure in the adiabatic phase , because a considerably elongated bar is formed in the adiabatic phase and such a structure is unstable ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "therefore , the separation between fragments does not represent the initial amplitude of the nonaxisymetric perturbations .",
    "thirdly , we compare the models having the same ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 ) = ( 0.001 , 0.03 ) , which are located in the fifth row and the second column in figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:4 ] , and [ fig:6 ] . in these models",
    ", fragmentation occurs in the second collapse phase for the model with @xmath135 , while fragmentation occurs in the adiabatic phase for the models with @xmath136 and 0.4 .",
    "this difference is understood as follows : for the model with a small non - axisymmetric perturbation ( @xmath135 ) , since both the rotation rate and the non - axisymmetric perturbation are small when the first core is formed , neither ring nor bar fragmentation occurs . on the other hand , fragmentation occurs in the bar for models with larger non - axisymmetric perturbations ( @xmath136 and 0.4 ) , because a considerably elongated bar is formed at the first core formation epoch .",
    "finally , the strong magnetized models @xmath234 are described .",
    "figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:4 ] , and [ fig:6 ] clearly show that fragmentation becomes harder with increasing @xmath102 especially in the strong magnetized models . for models with @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , fragmentation occurs in the second collapse phase for models having @xmath235 0.03 , 0.05 , 0.07 and 0.1 for @xmath236 , and @xmath100=0.07 and 0.1 for @xmath98=4 .",
    "in contrast , for models with @xmath137 ( fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) , no fragmentation occurs in models having the same @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "the increase of the angular velocity is suppressed by the magnetic effect ( e.g. , magnetic braking and outflow ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in strongly magnetized models , and then these models manage to fragment in the second collapse or protostellar phase when the initial cloud has a small amount of the non - axisymmetric perturbation of @xmath135 . in contrast , for a models with large @xmath102 , since the angular momentum is removed not only by the magnetic effect but also the gravitational torque as shown in figure  [ fig:5]_c_-_f _ , fragmentation is more severely suppressed .    figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:4 ] , and [ fig:6 ] show that the magnetic field strength , angular velocity , and non - axisymmetric perturbation play an important role in fragmentation , and they are closely related .",
    "thus , it is rather hard to derive the fragmentation condition from small numbers of calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows the cloud structure on the @xmath147 plane for the model of ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 , @xmath102 ) = ( 0.01 , 0.07 , 0.4 ) . in this figure ,",
    "the structure around the center of the cloud is plotted with different scales at the end of the calculation .",
    "the spatial scale of each successive panel differs by a factor of eight and thus the scale between figures  [ fig:7]_a _ and _ d _ differs by a factor of 512 . in this model , the first core is formed at @xmath237 .",
    "the first core repeats fragmentation and merger in the adiabatic phase .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:7]_a _ , in a large scale , the high - density region is composed of a central compact core and a surrounding ring - like structure . at the end of the calculation , the central compact core has the maximum density of @xmath238 , and a mass of @xmath239 .",
    "the second collapse occurs in the central core at 459yr after the first core - formation epoch .",
    "then , the central region fragments again at @xmath240 , and two protostars are formed , as shown in figures  [ fig:7]_c _ and _ d_. two fragments ( or protostars ) in figure  [ fig:7]_d _ have a mass of @xmath241 , and a separation of @xmath242au at the end of the calculation .",
    "on the other hand , in the surrounding ring - like structure , there are two clumps at ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) @xmath225 ( @xmath2265au , @xmath24325au ) as shown in figure  [ fig:7]_a_. these clumps have masses of @xmath244 .",
    "the clumps have the maximum density of @xmath245 and they continue to collapse until the calculation ends .",
    "thus , these clumps are expected to be more compact as time goes on , and then , a single or several protostars are formed in each clump .    as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] ,",
    "four clumps appear in this model .",
    "clumps formed in the adiabatic phase have a wide separation of @xmath246au , and they seem to be a triple system in a large scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7]_a _ ) . in the central compact core , there are two fragments , each of which contains a close binary system .",
    "this system is thought to evolve into a hierarchical star system , which is composed of two protostars with a large separation and two binary systems with a narrow separation , if fragments do not merge with each other and separations remain almost unchanged .",
    "in the gravitationally contracting core , the thermal pressure , rotation , and magnetic field work against the self - gravity .",
    "generally , in the initial clouds , the former three forces are characterized by the ratios to the gravitational energy , @xmath30 ( thermal energy ) , @xmath104 ( rotational energy ) , and @xmath105 ( magnetic energy ) , and the clouds are specified by the combination of these three parameters . in the previous section , we investigated the evolutions of clouds with the same @xmath30 ( @xmath247 ) but different @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the magnetic field and rotation are important for cloud fragmentation , because these forces cause the anisotropic patterns which promote fragmentation .",
    "however , the initial ratio of the thermal to the gravitational energy , which is related to the stability of the initial cloud , may affect cloud fragmentation . in this section , we compare the evolutions of clouds with the same @xmath104 and @xmath105 but different @xmath30 .    we investigate the evolutions of clouds with five different @xmath30 ( @xmath2480.01 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.7 ) .",
    "the cloud with @xmath249 , which has 1% of the thermal energy to the gravitational energy at the initial state , is highly gravitationally unstable , while that with @xmath250 is initially nearly in equilibrium .",
    "we fixed the three other parameters as ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 , @xmath102 ) = ( 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.01 ) . figure  [ fig:8 ] shows the evolution of the oblateness @xmath251 ( fig .  [ fig:8]_a _ ) , axis ratio @xmath252 ( fig .",

    "[ fig:8]_c _ ) , and normalized angular velocity @xmath254 ( fig .",

    "firstly , we show the evolution of clouds with large @xmath30 ( @xmath248 0.3 , 0.5 and 0.7 )",
    ". these models are initially more stable . in figure",
    "[ fig:8 ] , these models show similar evolutions for oblateness , normalized magnetic field strength , and normalized angular velocity .",
    "after the central densities exceed @xmath255 , the central regions have almost the same degrees of oblateness , magnetic fields , and angular velocities as shown in figures  [ fig:8]_a _ , _ c _ , and _",
    "d_. shock fronts appear and the first cores surrounded by the shock waves are formed at @xmath256 in these models .",
    "the first cores have almost the same properties except for the axis ratios . comparing all five models , the formed first cores are shown to have larger axis ratios in the models with smaller @xmath30 . @xcite",
    "and @xcite showed that the growth rate of the non - axisymmetric perturbation is larger in a more unstable cloud core from their linear analysis ( see also fig .",
    "14 of * ? ? ?",
    "since the cloud evolution converges to a self - similar solution as the cloud collapses even when the cloud is rotating and magnetized @xcite , the growth rate of the non - axisymmetric perturbation is also converged in the collapsing cloud .",
    "thus , the difference in the axis ratio which reflects the amplitudes of the non - axisymmetric perturbation comes from the growth in the early phase of the contraction . for this reason , the initially more unstable cloud ( i.e. , the cloud with small @xmath30 ) has a large amplitude of non - axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] shows the cloud structures near the center of the cloud just after fragmentation .",
    "fragmentation occurs via a ring - like structure in the models @xmath247 and 0.7 , while fragmentation occurs without the ring formation in the model with @xmath257 .",
    "this difference in the fragmentation pattern comes from the difference in the axis ratio of each model : the model with @xmath257 has a larger amplitude of non - axisymmetric perturbation than those of models with @xmath247 and 0.7 at the first core formation epoch .",
    "however , the scale and fragmentation epoch are almost the same for all models with @xmath258 , as shown in figures  [ fig:9]_b_-_d_. thus , even though the fragmentation patterns are different , the fragmentation scale and its epoch are hardly changed for models @xmath258 .    next is shown the evolution of the highly unstable cores with @xmath259 and 0.01 .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] indicates that the evolutions of oblateness , angular velocity and magnetic field of the models with @xmath259 and 0.01 differ appreciably from those of models with @xmath260 .",
    "in addition , the first core in the model of @xmath259 is considerably smaller than those in models with larger @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "in the model with @xmath249 , an extremely thin disk with @xmath261 is formed in the isothermal phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8]_a _ ) .",
    "@xcite expected these thin disks to fragment in the isothermal phase when the cloud collapses isothermally for a long time . in our calculation , however , fragmentation does not occur in the isothermal phase , because the central region begins to behave adiabatically just after the oblateness reaches its peak .",
    "then , an elongated bar is formed in the adiabatic phase , and the bar fragments at the central density @xmath262 .",
    "the fragmentation scale of the model of @xmath249 is @xmath263au , which is considerably smaller than in models with @xmath264 .",
    "thus , fragmentation size becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath30 for @xmath265 .    in summary , for models with @xmath264 ,",
    "the clouds show similar evolutions , and the first cores have almost the same properties .",
    "on the other hand , clouds with @xmath265 evolve in a completely different way , and the first cores have different properties .",
    "however , observations have shown that molecular cloud cores are observed in nearly thermal equilibrium against gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a , models that fragment at relatively low density have strong magnetic fields or rapid rotations , while models that fragment at relatively high density have weak magnetic fields and slow rotations .",
    "in addition , no fragmentation is expected for @xmath275 .",
    "this means that the core fragments just after the first core formation , and fragmentation never occurs if the core fails at this epoch .    in group a , fragments have mutual separations of @xmath276au .",
    "since we stopped calculation in group a after fragmentation occurs , we do not follow the cloud evolution until the protostar is formed ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , fragmentation may occur again for these models in the second collapse or protostellar phase . in that case",
    ", it is expected that hierarchical stellar systems are formed .",
    "some models that do not show fragmentation in the adiabatic phase fragment in the second collapse phase ( group b ) .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig:10 ] shows that the number of fragmentation models smoothly increases with the cloud density for @xmath143 .",
    "as shown in figures  [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:8 ] , the central region has a considerably weak magnetic field in the second collapse phase owing to the ohmic dissipation ( for detail , see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the magnetic braking is not so efficient that the central region can spin up as the cloud collapses . due to this accelerated rotation ,",
    "fragmentation is induced in the second collapse phase .",
    "fragments in group b have a typical separation of @xmath277 au .",
    "when the central density exceeds @xmath20 , the second core ( or protostar ) is formed . even after the second core formation , fragmentation frequently occurs . in group c",
    ", fragmentation occurs just after the second core formation , similar to the fragmentation in the adiabatic phase .",
    "fragments in group c have a typical separation of @xmath278au .",
    "the fragmentation process both in the adiabatic and protostellar phases is thought to differ from that in the second collapse phase .",
    "both in the adiabatic and protostellar phases , fragmentation occurs after the respective cores are formed .",
    "fragmentation easily occurs in a quasi - static core , and the core has enough time to amplify the perturbation that induces fragmentation . on the other hand , fragmentation occurs owing to cloud rotation in the second collapse phase .",
    "fragmentation does not occur in the isothermal phase when the cloud collapses in a self - similar fashion , because the self - similar solution with @xmath171 exists even in a rotating collapsing cloud @xcite . on the other hand , the clouds with @xmath279 form rotating disks and stop the contraction , because no self - similar solution exists @xcite .",
    "these clouds can fragment as shown in @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the cloud collapses with @xmath280 , the non - axisymmetric perturbation manages to evolve in this phase as shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , the fragmentation process in groups a and c is different from group b , which causes a gap between group a and group b. however we can not distinguish group b from group c , because the number of fragmentation models smoothly increases after @xmath143 . as a result ,",
    "the densities when fragments appear are divided into two groups : @xmath281 and @xmath143 .",
    "histogram of separation shows that the separations between fragments are clearly divided into two groups ( fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] right panel ) : models anticipating wide ( @xmath276au ) separations and those anticipating narrow ( @xmath282au ) separations . however , this feature of two distinct groups of separation may be smoothed out as long as the protostar evolves . in addition",
    ", we stopped the calculation after the first fragmentation occurs or the protostar is formed .",
    "thus , further fragmentation ( or protostellar formation ) may occur around a protostellar disk and the first core .",
    "thus , although further lengthy calculations are needed to know the real distribution of binary separations , we may observe two distinct groups of binary in young clusters composed of extremely young stars .      in figure",
    "[ fig:11 ] , the fragmentation epochs are plotted against the ratio of the initial magnetic energy to the rotational energy ( @xmath283 ) .",
    "the right axis in this figure means the jeans length that is calculated from the number density ( right axis ) , in which the temperature is related to the number density by the spherical symmetric calculation @xcite .",
    "only fragmentation models in the magnetized clouds are plotted in this figure .",
    "the figure shows that the fragmentation epochs shift to high density as @xmath283 increases .",
    "this indicates that cloud rotation promotes fragmentation , while the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation .",
    "this is valid through all the phases of cloud evolution from the isothermal to the protostellar phases .",
    "when the magnetic energy is lower than the rotational energy @xmath284 in the initial cloud , many models result in fragmentation in the adiabatic phase . on the other hand , when the magnetic energy is predominant over the rotational energy @xmath285 , fragmentation occurs mainly in the second collapse and protostellar phases , and some models do not show fragmentation . in this figure , there are some exceptions .",
    "two models show fragmentation in the second collapse phase even if @xmath286 . in these models",
    ", fragmentation does not occur in the adiabatic phase , because the non - axisymmetric perturbation is moderately grown and an induced spiral pattern effectively removes the angular momentum from the center of the cloud .",
    "thus , fragmentation is postponed .",
    "observations have shown that molecular cloud cores have high magnetic energies , but low rotational energies @xcite , which indicates @xmath287 figure  [ fig:11 ] indicates that these clouds barely fragment .",
    "this conflicts with observations that the majority of stars are born as binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this study , we calculated the evolution of a magnetized cloud in which the initial magnetic field lines are aligned to the rotation axis . when magnetic field lines are not aligned to the rotation axis",
    ", cloud evolution may be changed .",
    "however , @xcite showed that when the magnetic field lines are not aligned to the rotation axis at the initial state , the magnetic braking is more effective , and the angular momentum is effectively transferred outwardly .",
    "this implies that fragmentation is more suppressed . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed , in their ideal mhd calculations , that when initial cloud has a considerably distorted structure , fragmentation can occur even in a strongly magnetized cloud .    to understand observational binary frequency",
    ", we may need to calculate the cloud evolution in a non - ideal regime , parameterizing the cloud shape and the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic field lines , besides the non - axisymmetric perturbation , and the magnetic , rotational , and thermal energies .",
    "we investigated the cloud evolutions controlled by four parameters .",
    "each parameter corresponds to the magnetic @xmath98 , rotational @xmath100 , thermal energies @xmath30 , and the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation @xmath102 of the initial cloud .",
    "as shown in the previous sections , fragmentation significantly depends on the magnetic field strength and rotation rate of the initial cloud , while it slightly depends on the thermal energy and the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "thus , in figure  [ fig:12 ] , we have plotted the final state of each cloud against the magnetic field strength and rotation rate of the initial cloud . in this figure , @xmath138- and @xmath139-axes are parameters @xmath98 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "upper and right axes mean , respectively , the ratio of the magnetic ( @xmath105 ) and rotational ( @xmath104 ) energies to the gravitational energy of the initial cloud .",
    "bottom axis means the mass to magnetic flux ratio @xmath288 normalized by the critical value ( see , eqs  1012 ) . in this figure ,",
    "some models are located in the region of @xmath289 or @xmath290 , which indicates that the cloud is magnetically subcritical . in these models ,",
    "the initial cloud is magnetically subcritical as a whole , while the central region is magnetically supercritical since we adopted the bonnor - ebert density profile ( for detail , see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , any cloud can collapse in a sufficiently shorter timescale than the ambipolar diffusion timescale .    in figure  [ fig:12 ] , three types of symbols (",
    "circle @xmath291 , diamond @xmath292 , and cross @xmath293 ) are plotted against the initial magnetic fields and angular velocities .",
    "each symbol includes three models with different @xmath102 ( @xmath135 , 0.2 , and 0.4 ) .",
    "symbols indicate that ( i ) circle @xmath291 : at least one model out of three shows fragmentation in the adiabatic phase ( @xmath18 ) , ( ii ) diamond @xmath292 : in models that do not show fragmentation in the adiabatic phase ( @xmath294 ) , at least one model out of three shows fragmentation in the second collapse or protostellar phase ( @xmath143 ) , and ( iii ) cross @xmath293 : models show no fragmentation through any phases of cloud evolution ( @xmath295 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:12 ] , we can divide the parameter space into three regions : wide fragmentation , close fragmentation , and non - fragmentation , which correspond to the formation of wide binary , close binary , and single star .",
    "the separations between fragments are clearly divided into two classes ( wide and narrow separation ) according to the fragmentation epoch , as shown in figure  [ fig:10 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:12 ] indicates that models with strong magnetic fields and rapid rotations are distributed in the wide binary region .",
    "models in the wide binary region _ can _ fragment in the adiabatic phase , and fragments have separations of @xmath276au .",
    "however , not all models in this region fragment in the adiabatic phase .",
    "even among models in this region , some models show fragmentation only in the second collapse or protostellar phase , and some models show no fragmentation through any phases of cloud evolution .",
    "for example , models ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 ) = ( 0.01 , 0.05 ) , which are located in the wide binary region in figure  [ fig:12 ] , show fragmentation in the adiabatic phase for @xmath135 ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) and 0.4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) , while fragmentation occurs only in the second collapse phase for the model with @xmath136 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) . in models ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 ) = ( 0.001 , 0.07 ) , fragmentation occurs in the adiabatic phase for the models with @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) and @xmath230 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , while the protostar is directly formed without fragmentation for the model with @xmath137 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "thus , a small difference in the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation at the initial state has a possibility to induce a large difference in the fragmentation epoch . in some models located in the wide binary region , we stopped calculation before the protostar was formed when the fragmentation occurred in the adiabatic phase , because the fragments are likely to escape from the finest grid .",
    "thus , fragmentation can occur again in each fragment in the second collapse or protostellar phase , which seems to lead to a hierarchical stellar system .",
    "models distributed in the close binary region have a weaker magnetic field and slower rotation than models in the wide binary region . however , the tendency of rotation to promote fragmentation , and the magnetic field to suppress fragmentation is the same .",
    "models in the close binary region _ can _ fragment in the second collapse or protostellar phase , and fragments have separations of 0.0050.3au as shown in figure  [ fig:10 ] .",
    "however , similarly to wide binary models , even in models in the close binary region , some models do not fragment in either the second collapse or protostellar phases . for example , in models ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 ) = ( 1 , 0.05 ) , fragmentation occurs in the protostellar phase for the model with @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , while protostars are directly formed without fragmentation for the models with @xmath296 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , and 0.4 ( fig .  [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "models in the single - star region have stronger magnetic fields and slower rotations than those in the wide and close binary regions . in all models in this region ,",
    "the protostar is directly formed without fragmentation . as a result , a single compact sphere is formed at the center of the cloud , as shown in models ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 ) = ( 4 , 0.007 ) located in the lowest right corner of figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:4 ] , and [ fig:6 ] . these compact spheres are expected to evolve into single stars .",
    "models located in the wide / close binary regions have the possibility of forming the wide / close binary . as for fragmentation , it is difficult to forecast the cloud evolution from the initial conditions , and a small difference in the initial state sometimes results in different final outcomes .",
    "for example , even models located in the wide binary region have three possibilities : formation of a wide binary , a close binary , or a single star .",
    "that is , the parameters in wide / close binary regions are the necessary conditions , not sufficient conditions for wide / close binary formation .",
    "as shown in figures  [ fig:11 ] and [ fig:12 ] , our results indicate that cloud rotation promotes fragmentation , but the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation . in this section , to quantify the magnetic field and cloud rotation in the molecular cloud core , we compare our results with observations .    both magnetic field and rotation rate are observed in molecular cloud tmc-1c .",
    "tmc-1c has @xmath297 @xcite , and @xmath298 @xcite . as for magnetic field strength ,",
    "only maximum value was estimated for observational limitation .",
    "when a cloud has @xmath297 , figure  [ fig:12 ] indicates that ( i ) fragmentation occurs in the adiabatic phase and the wide binary can form when @xmath299 , ( ii ) fragmentation occurs either in the second collapse or protostellar phases , and the close binary can form when @xmath300 , and ( iii ) only a single star forms without fragmentation when @xmath301 .",
    "since observation showed @xmath302 , it is possible to form a binary system in tmc-1c .    in the observations of molecular cloud core",
    ", @xcite showed that the magnetic energy is comparable to gravitational energy ( @xmath303 ) , while @xcite and @xcite showed that rotational is much smaller than gravitational energy ( @xmath304 ) .",
    "thus , these observations indicate that it is difficult to form a ( wide ) binary system as shown in  5.3 . except for tmc-1c",
    ", however , there are few clouds in which both magnetic field and rotation rate are observed . in addition",
    ", the observed magnetic and rotation energies might not reflect the distribution of these energies in the majority of cloud cores , because we can only observe a limited range of the magnetic field strength and rotation speed : we can not observe weak magnetic field strengths and slow rotation speeds .",
    "furthermore , we have to measure the magnetic field strength and rotation rate at the same radius or the same number density in the molecular cloud core .",
    "to determine magnetic field strength and rotation rate precisely , we need a high - resolution observational facility such as the future alma .",
    "fragmentation conditions in the adiabatic phase ( i.e. , the wide binary region ) were investigated by @xcite , and @xcite using the ideal mhd approximation , which is not valid in the high density gas region with @xmath305 . in this paper , we studied cloud evolution in the non - ideal mhd regime",
    ". however , the wide binary region in figure  [ fig:12 ] corresponds well to results of @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:10 ] , many models located in the wide binary region fragment in the range of @xmath306 .",
    "in addition , since the density outside a small central part of the cloud is @xmath212 , the ohmic dissipation is not so effective at the fragmentation epoch . from this",
    ", there must be only a little difference between the ideal mhd and non - ideal mhd calculations for fragmentation appearing in the adiabatic phase .",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution of magnetized clouds and fragmentation conditions with their mhd - sph code .",
    "their results are qualitatively the same as ours : the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation .",
    "however , there is a small difference .",
    "they adopted a rotation energy of @xmath307 for the initial clouds .",
    "fragmentation occurs when @xmath308 in @xcite , while fragmentation occurs when @xmath309 in our calculations for models with @xmath307 , as shown in figure  [ fig:12 ] .",
    "thus , in @xcite , fragmentation occurs in stronger magnetic fields than ours .",
    "fragmentation is promoted by rotation , but it is suppressed by the magnetic field . in strongly magnetized clouds , since the cloud rotation is removed from the central region by the magnetic braking and outflow , fragmentation rarely occurs .",
    "outflow is closely related to the magnetic braking : both outflow and magnetic braking are caused by the torsional alfvn wave or the magnetic tension force generated by rotation of the central core .",
    "thus , the outflow is one of the proofs that the alfvn wave is properly resolved .",
    "when the alfvn waves are resolved , the outflow always appears after the adiabatic core ( or first core ) is formed . in the collapsing clouds",
    ", no outflow appears in @xcite , while the outflow appears in the grid - based mhd simulations , such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the angular momentum transfer caused by the torsional alfvn wave ( or the magnetic tension force ) may not be correctly resolved in @xcite , thus excess angular momentum around the center of the cloud is left .",
    "therefore , in their calculation , fragmentation occurs more frequently than ours .",
    "we investigate the cloud evolutions for @xmath310 in a large parameter space . in this study , we systematically calculated 147 models with different magnetic field , rotation , thermal energies , and the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation of the initial cloud .",
    "these calculations indicate that    1 .",
    "fragmentation significantly depends on the magnetic field and rotation , but slightly depends on the thermal energy and the amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation of the initial cloud . 2 .",
    "the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation , and rotation promotes fragmentation through all phases of cloud evolution .",
    "the distribution of the separations between fragments are clearly divided into two classes : fragments formed in the adiabatic phase have wide separations as @xmath276au , while fragments formed in the second collapse and protostellar phases have narrow separations as @xmath311au .",
