    "it is believed that the two - dimensional hubbard model@xcite is able to capture the essential physics of the high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in copper - oxides@xcite . in such systems , understanding the interplay between the superconductivity and the pseudogap regime could be the key to clarify the mechanisms behind the unconventional superconductivity .",
    "experimental results for some cuprates indicate a close relation among specific heat , condensation energy and the pseudogap@xcite .",
    "more precisely , due to the presence of a pseudogap on the normal state density of states , the jump in the specific heat and the superconducting condensation energy decrease below a given doping . besides ,",
    "according to references@xcite , the htsc phase diagram can be separated in two regimes : a weak coupling and a strong coupling regime@xcite .",
    "the weak coupling regime could be described , approximately , in terms of the conventional bcs superconductivity while the strong coupling regime would be governed by unconventional superconductivity . in this scenario ,",
    "the pseudogap is a property of the strong coupling regime@xcite . in this context",
    ", the investigation of the specific heat and the condensation energy of two - dimensional hubbard model may give us important insights about the physics of the htsc .",
    "in the present work , the normal - state pseudogap and the superconducting regime of a two - dimensional hubbard model is investigated within the green s functions technique@xcite .",
    "the pseudogap emerges on the strongly correlated regime in which the antiferromagnetic correlations associated with the spin - spin correlation function @xmath7 becomes sufficiently strong to open a pseudogap in the region @xmath8 on the fermi surface .",
    "such normal - state pseudogap is also observed in the @xmath8 point of the renormalized band .",
    "the specific heat jump is @xmath46_{_{t = t_c}}$ ] with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 being the energy per particle in the superconducting and in the normal sate , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 is obtained from equation ( [ eqe ] ) keeping the superconducting order parameter equal to zero @xmath50 .",
    "now , let s define @xmath51 as the difference between the normal ( @xmath52 ) and the superconducting ( @xmath53 ) states helmholtz free energy .",
    "the superconducting condensation energy is defined as : @xmath54",
    "the main focus of the present work is the strong coupling regime in which unconventional superconductivity may occurs . for this purpose",
    ", we analyzed the renormalized bands , the superconducting condensation energy and the specific heat jump as a function of the total occupation @xmath4 and of the interaction @xmath55 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the renormalized band @xmath56 . in the left panel , @xmath56 is shown for different values of total the occupation @xmath4 .",
    "the inset displays the region near the point @xmath8 in which a pseudogap develops when the occupation is increased .",
    "for instance , when @xmath57 , the band intersects the fermi energy @xmath58 , but , for @xmath59 the band does not reaches the fermi energy giving rise to a pseudogap between the band and @xmath58 .",
    "the right panel shows @xmath56 for @xmath59 and different interactions @xmath55 .",
    "the inset highlights a pseudogap on @xmath8 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 and the absence of pseudogap for @xmath62 . in the @xmath1-pole approximation",
    "used in this work@xcite the green s functions naturally present a pole structure which contains the spin - spin correlation function@xcite @xmath7 . in the present scenario",
    "the pseudogap emerges when the correlation function @xmath7 becomes sufficiently strong to move to lower energies the region of the nodal point @xmath3 of the renormalized band @xmath56 .",
    "this occurs because the renormalized band @xmath56 is deeply influenced by the momentum structure of the spin - spin correlation function@xcite @xmath7 . due to the antiferromagnetic character@xcite of @xmath7 , the region of the nodal point @xmath3 of @xmath56",
    "is strongly affected ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . as a consequence a pseudogap arises at the anti - nodal point @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath7 is very sensitive to @xmath4 and @xmath55 , indeed , @xmath63",
    "increases@xcite with @xmath4 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath63 reaches a critical value @xmath64 the pseudogap emerges .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) for the renormalized band @xmath56 is shown in figure [ fig1.1 ] for different occupations @xmath65 .",
    "the vertical line in @xmath66 indicates the position of the fermi energy @xmath67 and the model parameters are shown in the figure .",
    "when @xmath4 increases , the correlations become stronger , resulting in a narrowing of the density of states .",
    "however , the most important feature observed in the dos is the reduction of the dos on @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "such reduction is an effect of the presence of a pseudogap in the strong correlated regime of the system .",
    "the condensation energy @xmath6 as a function of the total occupation @xmath4 is shown in figure [ fig2](a ) .",
    "notice that @xmath6 increases with @xmath4 , reaches a maximum and then start to decrease .",
    "the depletion of @xmath6 for a @xmath4 greater than a given value is related to the development of a pseudogap near the anti - nodal points on the fermi surface .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with experimental data obtained for some cuprate systems @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2](b ) shows @xmath7 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the horizontal dotted line indicates approximately the value of @xmath7 , from which the system enters in the underdoped strong coupling regime .",
    "figure [ fig2](c ) displays the behavior of the condensation energy @xmath6 as a function of the interaction @xmath55 for several occupations .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is an optimal value of @xmath55 which produces a maximum @xmath6 .",
    "however , such optimum value changes with the occupation @xmath4 .",
    "this feature is associated to the opening of the pseudogap which occurs in the strong coupling regime .",
    "therefore , if @xmath4 decreases , a higher value of @xmath55 is necessary for the system to access the strong coupling regime .",
    "the correlation function @xmath7 shown in figure [ fig2](d ) may serve as a parameter to indicate that the system is reaching the strong coupling regime . as in figure [ fig2](b )",
    ", the horizontal dotted line indicates approximately the value of @xmath7 , from which the system enters in the underdoped strong coupling regime .",
    "the results for condensation energy @xmath6 versus @xmath65 , figure [ fig2](a ) , are in qualitatively agreement with a method bansed on the resonanting valence bond ( rvb ) spin liquid @xcite and also with results from the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite . in the flex approximation , @xmath6 increases with @xmath55 but does not present a maximum like the one observed in figure [ fig2](c ) .",
    "there are no available results for @xmath6 versus @xmath55 in the rvb method @xcite .",
    "the figure [ fig4 ] shows the specific heat jump @xmath5 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "notice that initially the @xmath5 increases slightly with @xmath4 but , above @xmath69 , @xmath5 starts to decrease .",
    "the decreasing in @xmath5 is an evidence of the presence of a pseudogap in the underdoped regime and is close related to the development of a pseudogap on the density of states ( dos ) ( see figure [ fig1.1 ] ) .",
    "the decreasing of the dos on @xmath58 when @xmath4 increases , is directly related to the pseudogap on @xmath58 and agrees with a high - resolution photoemission study @xcite of la@xmath70sr@xmath71cuo@xmath72 which suggests that a pseudogap is the main responsible for the similar behavior between the specific heat jump and the dos(@xmath58 ) observed in the underdoped regime .",
    "this result for @xmath5 agrees at least qualitatively , with a method based on the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) spin liquid @xcite in which the specific heat jump and the condensation energy decrease due to the opening of a pseudogap in the underdoped regime .",
    "also , the result for @xmath5 shown in figure [ fig4 ] is in qualitative agreement with experimental data for some cuprates @xcite .",
    "in this work we have investigated the superconducting condensation energy @xmath6 and the specific heat jump @xmath5 of a two - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "the results show that both @xmath6 and @xmath5 decreases in the strong coupling underdoped regime .",
    "it has been verified that this behavior is related to the opening of a pseudogap at the anti - nodal point @xmath8 on the renormalized band @xmath56 . in the strong coupling regime ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath7 presents in the band shift becomes sufficiently strong to move to lower energies the renormalized band @xmath56 in the region of the nodal point @xmath3 and as a consequence , a pseudogap opens in the @xmath8 point .",
    "the results obtained here corroborate the scenario that attributes the pseudogap to the strong correlations present in the underdoped regime@xcite .",
