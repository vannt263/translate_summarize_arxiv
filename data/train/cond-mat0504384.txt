    "physical aging of polymers and other soft materials was studied experimentally almost three decades ago by struik and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the interest of a wider community for this area was then greatly stimulated by work of lundgren et al .",
    "@xcite on the magnetic properties of spin glasses , and aging has since remained a source of important questions and insights in non - equilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "the basic features of aging were mainly established during the eighties in studies of magnetic linear susceptibility and autocorrelation function of spin glasses  @xcite , but are shared by many other systems , including , to cite only a few examples , type ii superconductors  @xcite , glasses  @xcite , granular materials  @xcite , and soft condensed matter  @xcite . following a rapid quench of a relevant parameter ,",
    "e.g.  when the temperature of a glass is rapidly lowered below a threshold value , aging materials are unable to re - equilibrate within the available observation time .",
    "what is observed is a slow change of physical properties which occurs at a decelerating pace , and in a fashion largely independent of most details of the microscopic interactions .",
    "more precisely , physical observables systematically depend on the system age @xmath4 , i.e.  the time elapsed from the initial quench , and the observation time @xmath3 . based on the relative values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 ,",
    "two dynamical regimes can be identified : for @xmath5 , macroscopic physical averages are approximately constant , and two - time correlations are related to the linear response through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "such a quasi - equilibrium regime strongly resembles the time translational invariant dynamics of thermal equilibrium , except for the fact that many quantities , e.g. relaxation times , can carry a parametric age dependence . for @xmath6 ,",
    "physical averages visibly drift and two - time averages no longer obey the fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "recent improvements in time resolved spectroscopic techniques  @xcite , have highlighted that , far from being a smooth flow , the drift of aging systems results from a highly irregular , so - called _ intermittent _ , process , whereby sudden and large configurational re - arrangements  @xcite punctuate the prevailing equilibrium - like fluctuations .",
    "these intermittent events may correspond to irreversible jumps from one metastable state to the next  @xcite .",
    "aging has raised a wealth of theoretical questions , for example , whether the non - equilibrium aging regime can be described through the concept of effective temperature  @xcite . of direct relevance for the present investigations",
    "is the origin of the so - called pure aging behavior , i.e. the @xmath7 scaling of various observables in the aging regime  @xcite and of modifyied scalings  @xcite which are called sub - aging and super- or even hyper - aging .",
    "this work discusses numerical investigations of the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of a _ realistic _ model of a - si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1 for a large temperature range .",
    "the material is a representative of a class of nitridic ceramics with chemical composition a - si@xmath8b@xmath9n@xmath10c@xmath11@xcite which can be synthesized via the sol - gel process@xcite .",
    "these ceramics are of great technological interest and are presently considered for high - temperature engine applications .",
    "nitridic ceramics appear to form amorphous covalent networks with a homogeneous distribution of the cations at least down to a scale of 1 nm@xcite .",
    "experimental studies have mainly focused on the quaternary compound a - sibn@xmath0c . under standard conditions , both a - sibn@xmath0c and a - si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1 are thermally stable and amorphous up to very high temperatures , e.g.  about @xmath12 k for a - sibn@xmath0c .",
    "they possess excellent mechanical and elastic properties : e.g.  a - sibn@xmath0c has a high bulk modulus of ca .",
    "@xmath13 gpa , and is stable against oxidation up to @xmath14 k.    the amorphous structure suggests a similarity with glassy materials , and hence the presence of aging properties of potential technological relevance . probing the glass transition of e.g.  a - si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1 ,",
    "the basic representative of this class of nitridic ceramics , is impossible at standard conditions , since decomposition takes place at @xmath15 k , i.e.   well before the ceramic melts .",
    "however , the melting transition might be accessible , as we have argued , at very high pressures  @xcite .    the mc simulations presented below aim at the determination of the temperature range below which the non - ergodic behavior of a - si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1 sets in , and at the characterization of the aging dynamics in that low temperature regime .",
    "admittedly , determining `` for all practical purposes '' whether a system is ergodic or not is not straightforward and is possibly an ill - posed question@xcite .",
    "as will become clear from the discussion , we refer to non - ergodic behavior as a collection of dynamical properties usually associated with glassiness , which , taken together , describe a strong deviation from thermal equilibrium .    to detect the onset of ergodicity breaking and characterize the behavior in both the ergodic and non - ergodic regions , we consider a number of relevant dynamical and thermodynamical measures : 1 ) the physical movement of the particles , as statistically characterized by the mean square displacement ( msd ) , is diffusive in the ergodic region , and sub - diffusive elsewhere .",
    "2 ) the related bond survival probability ( bsp)@xcite drops to a finite average close to zero on a characteristic time scale at sufficiently high temperatures but becomes scale - free and age dependent in the non - ergodic region .",
    "there , it decreases as a logarithmic function of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is close to one and depends on the type of particles forming the bond .",
    "3 ) the specific heat @xmath18 is calculated in three different ways , which agree in equilibrium but markedly differ in the non - ergodic region .",
    "4 ) the two - time energy - energy average @xmath19 defined in equation [ phidef ] . by construction , @xmath20 equals one in equilibrium or in a quasi - equilibrium regime , and is larger than one when the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "5 ) the age dependence of the energies of the local minima or so - called inherent structures ( is)@xcite characterizing the trajectories in the non - ergodic regime . these energies decrease logarithmically with the age .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ section_model ] we introduce the model and simulation technique . in section  [ section_ergodicity ]",
    "we define the statistical measures used to probe the ergodicity breaking and present the corresponding results .",
    "finally , section  [ section_discussion ] contains a broader discussion of the results , where we show that our findings are in general agreement with previous studies of the aging dynamics of much simpler atomistic models  @xcite and also with experimental results in e.g.  spin - glasses  @xcite , polymer systems@xcite and charge - density waves  @xcite .",
    "the model of a - si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1 consisted of @xmath21 si - atoms , @xmath21 b - atoms and @xmath22 n - atoms , respectively , in a @xmath23 @xmath24 cubic box . as an interaction potential",
    ", we employed a two - body potential from the literature@xcite based on fits to ab - initio energy calculations of crystalline and molecular compounds containing si- , b- and n - atoms .",
    "this potential successfully reproduces experimental data regarding structural properties such as bond lengths , and bulk properties , e.g.  vibrational frequencies , of the binary compounds si@xmath0n@xmath25 and bn and of molecules containing si@xmath26n@xmath26b units .",
    "the starting configurations for our simulations were generated by relaxation from high - temperature melts .",
    "the simulations were performed at fixed temperature and volume , with a monte - carlo algorithm using the metropolis acceptance criterion . in each update , an atom is randomly selected for an attempted move with a random direction , and with an average size chosen to achieve an acceptance rate of @xmath27 % .",
    "one monte - carlo cycle ( mcc ) corresponds to @xmath28 such individual moves .",
    "note that the kinetic energy ( @xmath29 per atom ) does not appear in mc - simulations , and that all quantities studied relate to the configurational energy . for comparison",
    ", we also performed md simulations in the melt .",
    "comparing mean square displacements determined from md and mc simulations , respectively , we estimate that ( at least in the high - temperature regime ) one mcc corresponds to about 0.5 fs . at low temperature ,",
    "the value of the microscopic time scale is not known precisely . however , this value is not crucial for the study of aging quantities which , as in our case , have a logarithmic time dependence or depend on the ratio of two times@xcite .    the temperatures investigated ranged from 25 to 10000 k ; however , for @xmath30 k no discernible dynamical evolution took place on the time scale of the simulations .",
    "for each temperature up to @xmath31 k and above @xmath31 k , @xmath32 and @xmath33 runs , respectively , of length @xmath34 mcc were performed .",
    "the energy @xmath35 as function of time was registered every @xmath36 mcc . along the individual trajectories for @xmath37 k , halting points @xmath38 were chosen , from which conjugate gradient minimizations were performed . in the following ,",
    "@xmath39 mcc is the initialization time of the mc - simulations needed for the system to reach equilibrium in the ergodic regime ( i.e.  at high temperatures ) , while @xmath40 is the waiting time before the observations begin .",
    "furthermore , an ensemble of @xmath41 runs of length @xmath42 mcc was studied , in order to investigate aging in greater detail , and with better statistics .",
    "each starting configuration of the ensemble was generated by quenching the system from @xmath43 k to @xmath44 k.    the diffusivity of the atoms in the high temperature regime was calculated straightforwardly from the mean square displacement as a function of time via the einstein - smochulowski relation ( @xmath45 ) . finally , in the bond survival probability data , a b - n or si - n bond was considered broken if the interatomic distance was above @xmath46  .",
    "in computing time averages and correlations we considered the observation interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "time averages over @xmath48 are denoted by an over - bar , while an angular bracket stands for an average over an ensemble of independent trajectories .",
    "evidence for ergodicity breaking can be extracted from a change of behavior in dynamical quantities i.e.   the msd and bsp , as well as from thermodynamical quantities , i.e.   the heat capacity , the energy average and the two - point energy average .",
    "all these data concur that ergodicity breaking occurs but differ to some degree with respect to the precise value of the transition temperature @xmath49 .",
    "the latter can be approximately located within the range @xmath50 k.    we consider the high temperature behavior first . for @xmath51",

    "the diffusion coefficients for the different atoms all have an arrhenius temperature dependence , with activation barriers @xmath54 ev , @xmath55 ev for silicon and boron atoms , respectively .    in the same regime ,",
    "the bsp is age independent and has a finite relaxation time @xmath56 .",
    "the values of @xmath56 were obtained by fitting the time dependence of the bond survival probability after the initialization time @xmath57 to a kohlrausch - williams - watts law:@xcite @xmath58^{\\beta}\\right),\\ ] ] yielding exponents @xmath59 .",
    "the time scale @xmath60 has an arrhenius - like temperature dependence , with activation barriers @xmath61 ev and @xmath62 ev for si - n and b - n bonds , respectively .",
    "arrhenius plots for the diffusion coefficients of silicon and boron atoms and for the relaxation times @xmath56 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ diffusionandbspinone ] .",
    "a deviation from the arrhenius scaling is apparent in both quantities as @xmath63 approaches 2000 k from above .",
    "the activation barriers found for both diffusion and bond breaking are in a similar range , suggesting that a single arrhenius time scale might characterize the high temperature dynamics . however , although diffusive processes need to be accompanied by bond - breaking , it is not clear whether this effect or steric blocking by neighbor atoms dominates the diffusion at various temperature scales .",
    "deviations from activated behavior appear in the relaxation time as the temperature decreases .",
    "approaching @xmath64 k from above , the diffusion coefficients for b- , si- and n - atoms all vanish for @xmath65 as @xmath66 with @xmath67 . a similar deviation of @xmath56 from an arrhenius law",
    "is observed when @xmath68 k for b - n and @xmath69 k for si - n , respectively , are approached from above .",
    "close to these temperatures , @xmath60 grows roughly like a power law : @xmath70 with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . at even lower temperatures ,",
    "the particle motion becomes sub - diffusive and the bsps fall off logarithmically .",
    "both quantities become scale free but gain a characteristic age dependence , discussed in more detail in section [ subsection_aging_properties ] .",
    "thermodynamical variables such as the specific heat @xmath18 , the energy average , and a suitably normalized two - time energy - energy average @xmath20 require averaging over an ensemble . for a fixed amount of numerical effort ,",
    "they are hence less precisely determined than local dynamical properties , but offer nevertheless concurring insights into ergodicity breaking and aging behavior .",
    "the heat capacity was evaluated with three different prescriptions , all agreeing in thermal equilibrium .",
    "note , that all specific heat data are reported on a per - atom basis .",
    "the disagreement observed at lower temperature shows that the system is non - ergodic for the observational time scale used .",
    "we note that agreement at higher temperatures does not neccessarily imply that the equilibrium state is reached  @xcite , since such an agreement is only a neccessary but not a sufficient criterion for the system to be in equilibrium .",
    "our first prescription is naively carried over from equilibrium thermodynamics . leaving the @xmath63 dependence of the mean energy understood on the r.h.s .",
    "of the equation , we define @xmath73 where the temperature derivative is performed numerically after the ensemble and time averaging denoted by angular brackets ( @xmath74 ) and an overbar , respectively .    secondly , we consider simulations where the temperature is increased or decreased by a small amount @xmath75 at age @xmath4 .",
    "the trajectories are then time - averaged over the time @xmath76 spent at @xmath77 .    this procedure yields @xmath78 finally , we gauge the variance of the energy fluctuations within the observation interval @xmath47 $ ] and estimate the heat capacity as @xmath79 for a range of observation times @xmath3 which straddles @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig_cv ] , where all @xmath18 values are on a per - atom basis , shows that all three expressions agree for temperatures above @xmath31 k , but clearly disagree below @xmath80 k , which leads to a provisional value for the ergodicity breaking temperature @xmath81 k.    within the non - ergodic region @xmath82 , we have studied @xmath83 for @xmath76 , the quasi - equilibrium regime , and for @xmath84 the non - equilibrium regime .",
    "the dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath63 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can also be obtained from the fitted time and age dependence of the mean energy given in eq .",
    "[ energy_drift ] below , by performing the time average and then differentiating with respect to @xmath63 . for @xmath85 and @xmath84 , we find that @xmath86 has a small dependence on the length of the time interval @xmath3 over which the time average is performed .",
    "this is connected to the logarithmic drift of the energy , which moreover is more pronounced just below @xmath49 than near @xmath87 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath88 mimics an experiment performed after some relatively long equilibration time @xmath89 and thus yields the most `` realistic '' value for the specific heat for all temperatures .",
    "@xmath90 provides a way to check the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : it should coincide with the two other expressions above @xmath49 , and additionally , below @xmath49 in the restricted quasi - equilibrium region @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , when increasing @xmath3 past @xmath4 the observed dynamics in @xmath90 changes from quasi - equilibrium to off - equilibrium in the temperature range between @xmath80 k and @xmath31 k ( c.f .",
    "inset in fig .",
    "[ fig_cv ] ) . recall that the ( trivial ) contribution to @xmath18 due to the change in kinetic energy is never included , i.e. , in equilibrium @xmath92 for @xmath93 k. furthermore , the interaction potential @xmath94 vanishes for @xmath95 , and",
    "thus this contribution to @xmath18 goes to zero as @xmath96 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cv ] , the above prescriptions for the specific heat yield , as expected , almost identical results in the high-@xmath63 ergodic dynamical regime , but differ at low @xmath63 .",
    "this indicates that ergodicity is broken below @xmath97 k. even in the low temperature region , @xmath88 and @xmath90 nevertheless roughly coincide in a restricted time interval which corresponds to the quasi - equilibrium regime @xmath98 .",
    "however , the inset clearly shows the large difference between @xmath90 in the quasi - equilibrium and the non - equilibrium regime , for temperatures below @xmath99 .",
    "yet another probe of ergodicity - breaking is the two - time energy average defined by @xmath100 above @xmath49 , and for @xmath91 below @xmath49 , we expect the dynamics to be time translational invariant , and hence @xmath101 . considering that the energy is negative and decreases monotonically with age , we expect an increase of @xmath20 with observation time , once the dynamics gains access to states of considerably lower energy .",
    "figure [ fig_phi ] depicts @xmath20 for three temperatures , @xmath102 k , @xmath103 k and @xmath104 k , and for three values of the system age , @xmath105 and @xmath106 mcc .",
    "the comparison clearly shows that ergodicity is broken as described at the lowest temperature ( t = 1250 k ) : due to the decrease of the configurational energy during aging , the two - time energy average increases as the observation time increases . at the intermediate temperature ( t = 1750 k )",
    "the aging effect is still visible but difficult to quantify , and at the highest temperature ( t = 2500 k ) it has vanished completely .",
    "taking all theses indicators , msd , bsp , @xmath107 and @xmath20 into account , we conclude that a - si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1 exhibits ergodicity breaking at @xmath2 k.     for three different temperatures 1250 k , 1750 k and 2500 k ( bottom to top ) .",

    "the ensemble - averaged energy @xmath111 of the inherent structures lying below the trajectories observed in the interval @xmath112 $ ] decreases logarithmically with @xmath3 , as does the mean potential energy @xmath113 . in both cases",
    "the logarithmic slope has a clear temperature dependence , but no significant @xmath4 dependence for @xmath114 mcc .",
    "the energy simply decreases logarithmically with the simulation time elapsed after the quench , i.e.  to a good approximation we find the functional form @xmath115 here , @xmath116 and @xmath117 for potential energies @xmath118 and minimum energies @xmath119 , respectively , and @xmath120 where the coefficients are measured in ev/(k@xmath121atom ) .",
    "note that energies are reported on a per - atom basis.the logarithmic decay of the energies is shown in fig .",

    "even though the data collapse is not perfect , the scaling plots demonstrate that the bonds become , on average more resilient as the age increases . for the si - n bond ,",
    "the best collapse is obtained for @xmath125 .",

    "this monotonic dependence on @xmath4 of the time range during which quasi - equilibrium behavior is still observed , correlates with the stiffening of the response of the system characteristic for aging processes : the longer the system is allowed to equilibrate , the longer is the subsequent time range during which equilibrium - like behavior is observed .",
    "this effect concurs with the logarithmic decay of @xmath35 and @xmath145 ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] ) and fully agrees with the general aging behavior previously discussed .",
    "numerical investigations of atomistic models with realistic interactions are computationally very demanding , and for the same numerical effort , the accuracy of the results obtained is lower than what can be achieved for more simplified models . in spite of this limitation ,",

    "thus this result provides another confirmation that ergodicity breaking takes place at @xmath153 .    in summary ,",
    "all the numerical evidence obtained from our simulations shows that the thermal quench of a si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1 melt produces a material in a state of strong thermodynamic disequilibrium , which then relaxes through the aging process . as we have noted in the introduction , a - si@xmath0b@xmath0n@xmath1",

    "thus , we surmise that aging phenomena analogous to those investigated here for a quenched melt also occur in the amorphous ceramic generated via the sol - gel route .",
    "the metastable states reached during aging become gradually lower in energy , which could lead to a strengthening of the material . on the other hand , the structural transformations which would accompany aging",
    "could lead to the formation of nano - crystallites and internal grain boundaries , whence the overall structure might develop e.  g.  cracks , and thus lead to a weakening of the mechanical properties of the material .",
    "this could especially be the case , if crystallites of binary or ternary phases are formed .",

    "<S> @xmath3 show a systematic parametric dependence on the waiting time @xmath4 , or age , elapsed after the quench . </S>",
    "<S> the aging dynamics stiffens as the system becomes older , which is similar to the behavior of highly idealized models such as ising spin - glasses and lennard - jones glasses .    </S>",
