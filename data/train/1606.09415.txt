    "multivariate categorical data arise frequently in relevant applications .",
    "notable examples include epidemiology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , psychology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , social science ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and business intelligence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  among others . in such settings",
    "it is increasingly common to observe a vector of categorical responses for each subject along with a qualitative variable indicating membership to a specific group .",
    "for example , in psychological studies a vector of categorical traits is typically measured for each individual , and the focus is on studying differences in these traits across groups , such as gender or education level ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we are motivated by election polls measuring differences in voters opinions across party affiliation groups , during the 2012 american national elections . in our study ,",
    "categorical opinions on @xmath0 topics are available for @xmath1 voters , along with their declared party of affiliation .",
    "these topics cover evaluations of obama decisions on national and international affairs , along with opinions on obama and romney personality traits .",
    "see table [ tab_1 ] for an example .",
    ".opinions on several political topics collected from voters during the 2012 american national elections along with their declared party affiliation group . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we consider three simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our methods in various scenarios , characterized by different types of dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , in a first scenario we generate the data to obtain no group differences in the marginals of @xmath2 , and only sparse dependencies between pairs of variables @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with these pairwise dependence structures being the same across the groups defined by @xmath3 .",
    "the second scenario induces instead dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by allowing a subset of the marginals of @xmath2 , and the pairwise dependence structure between @xmath4 , @xmath5 to change with @xmath3 .",
    "finally , the third scenario characterizes a challenging case in which there are no changes in the marginals of @xmath2 , but only sparse group differences in the pairwise dependence structure .",
    "hence the dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is in few higher - order structures .    in accomplishing the above goals we focus on @xmath6 groups and @xmath0 categorical variables having @xmath7 levels .",
    "we consider @xmath8 statistical units equally divided in the two groups and simulate data @xmath9 , @xmath10 from our representation for @xmath11 , with the settings in table [ sphericcase ] . according to table [ sphericcase ] ,",
    "@xmath12 is defined by considering @xmath13 mixture components , and letting the component - specific probability mass functions @xmath14 be equal across the @xmath13 components @xmath15 for all the variables @xmath16 except those having indices @xmath17 in the set @xmath18 .",
    "hence , for the variables @xmath16 with indices in @xmath19 , there will be no group differences in their marginals , and no pairwise dependencies for all the three scenarios .    by letting @xmath20 in the first scenario , we induce independence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , meaning that all the marginals and the sparse pairwise dependencies between variables @xmath4 having indices @xmath17 and @xmath21 in @xmath22 do not change with @xmath23 . in the second scenario @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "are instead allowed to be different , and the component - specific probability mass functions @xmath14 , for @xmath26 are defined to induce group differences in the marginals @xmath16 , @xmath26 , and only sparse group changes in the pairwise dependence among pairs @xmath4 . in particular , according to our definition of @xmath11 , the variables comprising @xmath2 are all pairwise independent in group @xmath27 , while in group @xmath28 we observe pairwise dependence only between pairs @xmath4 with @xmath26 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "this pairwise dependence structure is maintained in the third simulation , but the component - specific probability mass functions are slightly modified to enforce no group differences for the marginals of the variables @xmath16 , @xmath26 , thereby obtaining @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",
    "this represents a challenging scenario for those methods which assess evidence of global dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 via inference on group differences in the marginals of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , in the third scenario , the dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is only in sparse higher - order pairwise dependence structures .     of the cramer s",
    "v coefficients in to assess group differences in the marginals @xmath16 , @xmath33 .",
    "right : for the same scenarios , posterior mean @xmath34 of the cramer s v coefficients in to test for pairwise dependence between each @xmath4 in group @xmath27 ( lower triangular matrix ) and in group @xmath28 ( upper triangular matrix).,width=359 ]    [ fig : sim1 ]      we perform posterior inference under the proposed model  with priors defined in section [ sec3 ] , setting @xmath35 , @xmath36 for each @xmath32 and @xmath37 .",
    "we maintained these default hyperparameter choices in all the three different simulations to assess sensitivity to prior settings , observing no evidence that posterior inference is sensitive to hyperparameter s choices .",
    "we consider @xmath38 gibbs samples and set a conservative upper bound @xmath39 , allowing the sparse dirichlet prior @xmath40 to adaptively empty redundant mixture components .",
    "trace - plots suggest convergence is reached after a burn - in of @xmath41 .",
    "we additionally obtain very good mixing , with most of the effective sample sizes for the quantities of interest around @xmath42 out of @xmath43 .    using the gibbs samples for @xmath44 , in the first simulation scenario , we obtain a posterior probability for the global alternative @xmath45 , providing correct evidence of no group differences in the multivariate categorical data .",
    "we obtain similarly accurate performance for the other two simulation scenarios , providing a posterior probability @xmath46 , which correctly highlights the global dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in both scenarios . the permutation test proposed in @xcite provided correct results in the first two scenarios",
    " when independence and dependence are evident from the marginals  but failed to reject the hypothesis of independence with a @xmath47-value of @xmath48 in the third scenario .",
    "this is not surprising as this procedure aggregates @xmath47-values of multiple tests assessing evidence of group differences in the marginals  which do not vary with groups in the third scenario .",
    "we additionally attempted the global testing procedure based on the latent class analysis @xcite , estimating the latent classes with the ` r ` package ` polca ` .",
    "also this approach produced accurate conclusions in the first two scenarios .",
    "however , we found the results quite unstable in the last case , even when the total number of classes is correctly set equal to the true value @xmath13 .",
    "this may be related to the systematic bias associated with this procedure as well as possible convergence issues in the expectation - maximization algorithm .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sim1 ] , our procedure provides also accurate results in assessing local group differences .",
    "consistent with the three generative mechanisms of the simulated data , the posterior distributions for the coefficients @xmath49 provide evidence of group differences in the marginals only for variables @xmath16 with @xmath26 in the second scenario .",
    "we obtain in fact @xmath50 only for @xmath26 , in the second scenario .",
    "refer to @xcite for a discussion on using @xmath51 as a measure of local dependence .",
    "we obtain similar accurate results in studying pairwise dependence across groups . in line with the simulation settings in the second and third scenarios , the posterior distributions for the coefficients @xmath52 correctly highlight no pairwise dependencies in group @xmath27 , and only sparse ones in group @xmath28 .",
    "in fact we correctly obtain @xmath53 only for pairs @xmath4 with @xmath26 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "similar accurate performance is obtained in the first scenario , with @xmath54 and @xmath53 , only for pairs @xmath4 with @xmath26 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "local analyses via separate chi - square tests with a false discovery rate control at a level @xmath55 , provide accurate conclusions for the tests on the marginals , and on the pairwise dependencies in group @xmath27 , but lead to one false discovery for the pairwise tests in group @xmath28 for all the three simulation scenarios .",
    "these empirical findings further support our procedures , which gain power by borrowing information across the local tests , and incorporate an automatic multiplicity control through the hierarchical bayesian formulation .",
    "political polls play a key role in driving public opinion and provide useful insights for the candidates in order to evaluate and improve their current campaigns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we apply our methods to a subset of the 2012 polls data from the american national election studies available at http://electionstudies.org/ and described in section [ sec1 ] .",
    "the data set comprises categorical opinions on @xmath0 topics collected via face - to - face interviews for @xmath56 independent democrats , and @xmath57 unaffiliated voters . although it is possible to consider more elaborated affiliation groups , for interpretability we focus on a scenario of potential interest for a democratic candidate .",
    "in fact , as the party affiliation is a relevant factor in the vote choice ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a democratic candidate may be particularly interested in studying differences in opinions for voters affiliated to his party and the unaffiliated ones .",
    "these unaffiliated voters are potentially more sensitive to his campaign than republicans , and therefore are worth being targeted to increase their positive opinions , reaching at least similar levels to those expressed by the independent democrats .",
    "credible intervals ( grey segments ) of the difference @xmath58 between their probability mass functions in independent democrats and unaffiliated voters , respectively.,width=415 ]    [ fig : app1 ]    , assessing pairwise dependence between the different voter s opinions , within each party affiliation group.,width=396 ]    [ fig : app3 ]    posterior computation is performed considering the same hyperparameter settings as in the simulation study , except for increasing @xmath59 to 15 .",
    "also in this case we obtain convergence after a burn - in of @xmath41 and good mixing , with most of the effective sample sizes around @xmath60 out of @xmath43 .",
    "results from posterior inference offer interesting insights on group differences in voter s opinions with @xmath46 providing evidence of changes in opinions between unaffiliated voters and independent democrats .",
    "the local tests on the marginals interestingly suggest that such global variations are partly attributable to different opinions on obama political decisions and personality traits across the two groups of voters .",
    "evaluations of romney personality traits instead do not differ across groups with @xmath61=0.47 $ ] , where @xmath62 denotes the set of indices for the variables characterizing opinions on romney personality traits .",
    "figure [ fig : app1 ] clarifies the above interesting findings by summarizing the posterior distribution of the difference @xmath58 between the probability mass functions characterizing opinions on obama and romney personality traits , in independent democrats and unaffiliated voters , respectively .",
    "leveraging proposition [ prop3 ] , these quantities are defined as @xmath63 , for each @xmath64 .",
    "consistent with the local tests , the opinions on romney remain mostly constant across groups , whereas those for obama change . as expected independent democrats have a more positive opinion for obama personality traits than unaffiliated voters , who express in fact critical opinions mostly on subjective traits such as morality and honesty .",
    "hence a democratic campaign improving these traits may have relevant effects at increasing the proportion of potential voters .    according to figure [ fig : app3 ] , improving the opinions on a subset of the personality traits of obama",
    "may have an effect in enhancing positive opinions also on the others .",
    "in fact , the posterior distributions of the pairwise model - based cramer s v highlight an interesting block structure in both groups , with higher pairwise dependence within opinions on the traits of each candidate as well as evaluations of obama political decisions .",
    "we additionally observe a reasonable pairwise association between the opinions on obama personality traits and assessments on his political decisions .",
    "these pairwise dependencies are higher in the group of unaffiliated voters .",
    "as these individuals are not influenced by party affiliation , it is reasonable to expect their opinions on the personality of a particular candidate to reflect their objective assessments on his actual political decisions .",
    "as it is always possible to factorize a joint probability mass function @xmath65 as @xmath66 , for every @xmath67 and @xmath68 , proposition [ prop1 ] holds if any collection of conditional probability mass functions @xmath69 , admits representation , for every @xmath70 .    recalling corollary 1 in @xcite , it is always possible to separately represent the conditional probability mass function of @xmath2 as @xmath71 for each group @xmath72 , with @xmath73 denoting the probability that the categorical random variable @xmath16 assumes value @xmath74 in mixture component @xmath75 , given that @xmath76 .",
    "hence proposition [ prop1 ] follows after defining each @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath32 as the sequence of unique component - specific probability mass functions appearing in the above separate factorizations for at least on group @xmath79 .",
    "consistent with this definition the associated group - specific mixing probabilities will be @xmath80 if @xmath81 , @xmath32 and @xmath82 , otherwise , proving proposition [ prop1 ] .",
    "recalling results in proposition [ prop1 ] , it is always possible to rewrite the @xmath83 distance @xmath84 between @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87 with @xmath88 if @xmath89 , @xmath32 and @xmath90 , otherwise , for @xmath70 . therefore the prior probability @xmath91 assigned to a neighborhood of @xmath86 can be expressed as @xmath92with @xmath65 and @xmath93 factorized as above , and @xmath94 denoting an indicator function . following @xcite a sufficient condition for the above integral to be strictly positive , is that all the above priors have full @xmath83 support on their corresponding spaces . as @xmath95 and @xmath96 are dirichlet priors , by definition @xmath95 has full @xmath83 support on the simplex @xmath97 and @xmath98 has full @xmath83 support on the simplex @xmath99 , for each @xmath32 .    to conclude the proof we need to show that @xmath100 for any @xmath101 and @xmath102 , when the group - specific mixing probabilities @xmath103 have prior @xmath40 defined as in equation .",
    "marginalizing out the testing indicator @xmath44 , a lower bound for the previous probability is @xmath104 if the true model is generated under independence between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , the true mixing probability vectors are constant across groups and therefore the dirichlet priors for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath70 , ensure the positivity of both summands .",
    "when instead the true mixing probability vectors change across groups , the term @xmath107 is no more guaranteed to be strictly positive .",
    "however @xmath108 remains positive for every @xmath109 , as under the alternative we assume independent dirichlet priors @xmath110 for the group - specific mixing probability vectors , each one having full @xmath83 support on @xmath111 .    to obtain @xmath112 we need to marginalize out in @xmath113 all the configurations @xmath114 . in accomplishing this goal note that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , recalling factorization for @xmath113 we obtain @xmath117{=}\\sum_{h=1}^{h } { \\nu}_{hx } \\prod_{j \\in \\mathcal{j } } \\pi_{hj}(y_j),\\end{aligned}\\]]where the last equality follows after noticing that @xmath118 is the joint probability mass function of a multivariate categorical random vector with @xmath119 independent variables and joint sample space @xmath120 .",
    "therefore the summation of its joint probability mass function on the whole sample space provides @xmath121 .",
    "exploiting model for @xmath65 , the proof of @xmath122 is an immediate consequence of the above derivations .",
