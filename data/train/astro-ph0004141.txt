    "as part of a broad band spectral survey , with the bepposax satellite , of a sample of bright seyfert 1 galaxies ( 210 kev flux greater than 12 mcrab ) , this paper follows those on ngc 4593 ( guainazzi et al .",

    "the other parameters remain similar to those of the pure bms fit .",
    "the extremely large value of @xmath21 is likely due to a bad description of the continuum at the line energy , which would affect also the determination of @xmath39 .",

    "the presence of a ( much narrower ) iron emission line is evident . for completeness",
    ", we report that the use of the module absori in xspec , as a more detailed description of the warm absorber than the two edges , leads to the same value of @xmath31 ( 2.11 ) , hence to the same problem with @xmath21 and @xmath39 .    to further investigate this aspect , we fitted the lecs data with a simple power law absorbed by @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath62 is 142/53 , and the ratio data / model in fig .",

    "some improvement is achieved using absori , but the @xmath62 = 89/51 remains unacceptable .",
    "we therefore decided to describe this situation by adding to the bms another broad component , referred to as a soft power law ( spl , @xmath65 ) .",

    "the addition of the two edges leads now to no significant improvement ( @xmath62=134.5/132 ) and only ovii is at best marginally detected .",
    "the high significance of the line and of the cut ",
    "off is instead demonstrated by comparing the @xmath62 given above with those obtained without the line , 154.5/135 , and without both line and cut  off , 212.9/136 .",
    "the results , under bms+spl+wa , are given in table 2 and illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . note that again @xmath64 is negligible compared to @xmath8 . to avoid their strong interplay with @xmath31 ,",
    "both @xmath64 and @xmath0 were frozen at their best fit values when the errors on all the other parameters , given in table 2 , were determined ; likewise the confidence contours for the couples ( @xmath31 , @xmath39 ) , ( @xmath31 , @xmath66 ) , and ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , given in fig . 4 , 5 and 6 , were also obtained .",
    "caution is therefore due when discussing single parameters , in particular the marginal evidence that the value of @xmath20 in table 2 is larger than the neutral value of 6.4 kev should be regarded as hardly significant . as an independent test , we checked whether a partially ionized reflector was preferable , and obtained a best fit value of zero for the ionization parameter .    since the iron line is marginally resolved , we tried the relativistic profile description for an accretion disk around a schwarzschild black hole , with the inner radius @xmath67=6 @xmath68 and the emissivity slope @xmath69=-2 fixed : the line energy , the outer radius @xmath70 , the intensity and the inclination angle being the free parameters .",
    "the angle in the rc component was linked to that of the disk , the main goal of this exercise being to provide a constraint on @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath62 is comparable to that of the gaussian description .",
    "the inclination angle is 56@xmath12 , but at the 90% confidence level it could be anything between 0@xmath12 and 87@xmath12 ; this reflects itself into a 90% interval for @xmath39 ranging from 0.35 to 3.8 . in practice no useful constraint is obtained on @xmath18 , @xmath71 2900 , and all other parameter values remain very similar to those in table 2 .    the comparison between the two parts of the observation , fitted independently , shows no significant differences in the spectral parameters . in particular for the parameters of the broad components in the first ( second ) part of the observation we obtain : @xmath0 = 2.46@xmath72 ( @xmath0 = 2.72@xmath73 ) , @xmath31 = 1.64@xmath74 ( @xmath31 = 1.74@xmath75 ) , @xmath66 = 79@xmath76 kev ( @xmath66 = 80@xmath77 kev ) , @xmath39 = 0.64@xmath78 ( @xmath39 = 0.83@xmath79 ) . a joint fit of the two parts , with all parameters linked ( that is the same ) except for the normalizations , gives a very good @xmath62 = 285/277 : the ratios of the soft and of the hard pl intensities between the first and the second part are equal to 1:1.40 and 1:1.21 respectively , thus indicating that both components increased , but the spl more than the hard pl .",
    "as an alternative to the spl , we tested the black body description of the soft excess , which was adopted by pounds et al .",
    "the @xmath62 = 137.6/132 is perfectly acceptable , and @xmath80 = 0.07 kev , but , although somewhat smaller than those from the bms+wa fit , the values @xmath21 = 2.3 kev and ew = 580 ev remain improbably large , and lead us to believe that the spl option is to be preferred .",
    "the bms fit ( above 0.4 kev ) yields @xmath62=117.5/132 .",
    "the addition of the two edges leads to a slight decrease , @xmath62=113.7/130 , and only ovii is marginally detected .",
    "the results of this fit are given in table 2 under bms+wa and shown in fig .",
    "they are further illustrated as confidence contours for the couples ( @xmath31 , @xmath39 ) , ( @xmath31 , @xmath66 ) , and ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) in fig . 8 , 9 , 10 .",
    "the significance of the line and of the cut ",
    "off is further demonstrated by the @xmath62 obtained without the line ( 155/133 ) and without both line and cut  off ( 189.6/134 ) . the iron line ,",
    "consistent in energy with 6.4 kev , is not resolved .",
    "the fit with a relativistic profile gives essentially the same ew , and no useful information on the inclination angle .",
    "albeit marginal , the detection of a warm absorber is new in this object .",
    "note , on the other hand , that the intrinsic , cold @xmath64 is negligible compared to @xmath8 .",
    "we believe that the bepposax data , thanks to their major asset , namely the very broad band , demontrate that the continuum is steeper at low than at high energies ( @xmath810.9 ) , thus confirming that reports , from measurements prior to asca , of a  soft excess \" below about 1 kev were substantially correct . il would be important to establish whether the curvature is due to the superposition of two components ( as modelled by us ) or is an intrinsic property of the same physical component . the comparison between the two parts of our observation described in sect .",
    "3 suggests at least a physical connection between the two components .",
    "the extrapolation of the spl to uv wavelengths is also of interest .",

    "the extrapolation of the spl , with @xmath86 and @xmath0 the best fit values in table 2 , gives 18.6@xmath8410@xmath85 erg @xmath10 s@xmath6 .",
    "while the near coincidence is probably fortuitous , in view of variability and the uncertainty on @xmath0 , it suggests a close connection between the uv and the soft x ",
    "ray excess emission .",
    "this result is in agreement with the finding by wang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in a heterogeneous sample of objects ( see also laor et al .",
    "1997 ) , but it adds value to it for this particular galaxy , because it is obtained extrapolating the soft excess , rather than the simple power law fitted to the rosat data . for an approach similar to ours , based on simultaneous rosat and ginga observations of other objects , see walter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . since mk 509 for its luminosity could be ranked among quasars , it is appropriate to note that @xmath0 is close to the mean value of 2.8 in the range 3501050 a found by zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the composite hst spectrum of 41 radio - quiet quasars .",
    "another important property of the continuum , seen for the first time in this object , is the evidence of a cut  off occurring at @xmath8770 kev .",
    "the few other objects in which this property has been determined have best fit values greater than 100 kev ( matt 2000 , and references therein ) , the only exception being ngc 4151 ( jourdain et al .",

    ", we retrieved from http://tartarus.gsfc.nasa.gov/ the 0.6 - 10 kev data of the asca observation ( 1994 , april 29 ) investigated by reynolds ( 1997 ) and by george et al .",
    "the average intensity in the two observations is the same within 10% . as a simple compatibility test",
    ", we estimated the @xmath62 when the bms+spl+wa model is adopted , with all parameters equal to the best fit values in table 2 , except for the normalizations @xmath86 , @xmath88 and @xmath22 , which are left free , and with the o optical depths first set to zero .",
    "we obtain an unacceptable @xmath62=2020/1881 .",
    "the residuals undoubtedly show the signature of the o vii edge , and upon letting the o edges also free , we obtain indeed a pretty acceptable @xmath62=1933/1879 , with @xmath23(o vii)= 0.20@xmath150.04 ( 90% for one i. p. , @xmath24=2.71 ) , @xmath23(o viii ) consistent with zero , a ratio @xmath89=1.1 , within 15% of the bepposax fit , and an iron line ew @xmath63 110 ev , similar to the bepposax fit .",
    "> from this exercise we would conclude that the two independent data sets are consistent with a model which includes both a  soft excess \" , in the form of a steepening of the power law below about 1 kev , as well as a warm absorber .",
    "due to the much higher statistics and better resolution at the appropriate energies , it is not surprising that the asca data put a stronger and more reliable constraint on the warm absorber than our data .",
    "the @xmath23(o vii ) given above is larger than 0.11@xmath90 , the value obtained by reynolds ( 1997 ) jointly with @xmath91 @xmath10 . in our exercise an almost identical value , @xmath23(o vii ) = 0.10 ,",
    "is obtained instead when we leave @xmath64 free : the @xmath62 drops to 1850/1878 , and @xmath64=3.6@xmath9 @xmath10 , but this column is by at least one order of magnitude incompatible with our data ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this discrepancy , already noted in the bms+wa fit ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) , is probably connected with the epoch - dependence in the response of the asca - sis instruments below 1 kev , which is not yet well understood ( t. yaqoob , private communication ) .",
    "for a slab seen face - on ( @xmath18=0@xmath12 ) , the iron line ew@xmath63100 ev is roughly consintent with both a normal abundance and the solid angle @xmath92 corresponding to the best fit value of @xmath39 ( matt et al .",
    "1991 , matt et al .",
    "however , lacking a constraint on the inclination angle , and taking into account the uncertainties , the issue whether @xmath1 is indeed much less than 2@xmath2 , as it was rather convincingly found to be the case for the reprocessing in the accretion disk of ic 4329a ( perola et al .",
    "1999 ) , remains open .",
    "our estimate of @xmath39 for a face  on reprocessing slab is fully consistent with an @xmath93 geometry .",

    "the line width is too poorly constrained for us to elaborate on the contribution by the accretion disk , and note that also in the asca observation ( grandi et al .",
    "1998 ) the line is barely resolved .",
    "we can not exclude that a sizeable fraction of the reprocessing gas might be located further out . in this respect , comparison with the results obtained from the asca+osse observation by grandi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is suggestive , since at that epoch the source was a factor 2.4 fainter .",
    "they find @xmath31 = 1.73@xmath150.06 , @xmath39 = 1.64@xmath94 , ew = 230@xmath95 ev ( errors for @xmath24=2.71 ) .",
    "none of these estimates differ from ours more than the combined errors .",
    "yet the smaller value of @xmath31 agrees with an earlier finding ( treves et al .",
    "1990 ) of a correlation between @xmath31 and flux , while the larger values of both @xmath39 and ew could be due to a lag in the response from a reprocessing material located far away from the variable pl source .",
    "more sensitive and better resolution observations might confirm this suggestion , which indicates an @xmath96 geometry for the reprocessing in the accretion disk also in this object .    concerning the absorption ,",
    "we find for the first time an admittedly modest evidence of a warm absorber ; at the same time we do not confirm the claim by grandi et al .",

    "a particularly interesting result of the present study is the overall shape of the `` direct '' continuum in mrk 509 , which can be empirically described as a combination of two power laws .",
    "the soft power law we detect is , in the first place , a confirmation of earlier evidence of a low energy excess ( see sect .",

    "1994 , fiore et al .",
    "1995 , laor et al .",
    "1997 for a broader discussion of the problem ) , it could arise from comptonization in the innermost parts of the disk in regimes of high accretion rate ( e. g. czerny & elvis 1987 , maraschi & molendi 1990 ) .",
    "the hard power law is affected by a high energy cut  off , which can be empirically described as an exponential factor with @xmath66 about 70 kev .",
    "the currently most popular models for this component involve comptonization by a hot corona ( e. g. haardt & maraschi 1993 , zdziarsky et al .",
    "1994 , ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) , in which the cut ",
    "off is related to the temperature of the corona .",
    "our results on mrk 509 are similar to those on ngc 4151 , possibly indicating that seyferts with unusually flat continua feature unusually low cut  off energies ( piro 1999 ) .",
    "however it is fair to say that proper , selfconsistent models need to be used in the fits in order to recover correctly the physical parameters . as extensively discussed by petrucci et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in the context of a bepposax observation of ngc 5548 , the exponential cut  off powerlaw is indeed a quite rough approximation to realistic componization models .",
    "overall the spectrum of mrk 509 requires a complex structure for the accretion disk , to explain both the soft and the hard components .",
    "this will be dealt with in a future paper , where we would like to address the problem in a comprehensive manner for all the objects in the bepposax sample of bright seyfert 1 . there",
    "we shall include also a more advanced analysis of the comptonization model , underlying the continuum shape and in particular the high energy cut  off seen in mcg  + 8 - 11 - 11 , already discussed in grandi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "this approach will also attempt to deal selfconsistently with the `` reprocessed '' spectral components , namely the amount of continuum reflection along with the energy / width / intensity of the iron line , contributed by the matter in the accretion disk .",
    "here we limit ourselves to note that , although not conclusively yet , directly from this observation in mrk 509 and from comparison with an asca observation in mcg  + 8 - 11 - 11 , there are indications of the accretion disk contributing to the reprocessing much less than one would expect if the solid angle @xmath1 were 2@xmath2 .",
    "such a situation was also , and rather more convincingly found to hold in ic 4329a ( perola et al .",
    "1999 ) .    finally , in both mrk 509 and mcg  + 8 - 11 - 11 our observations present some evidence of a warm absorber .",
    "this evidence is roughly consistent with the more significant one found with asca in mrk 509 by reynolds ( 1997 ) and by george et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who did not however confirm in their analysis the presence of a soft excess .",
    "we have shown that the asca data are compatible with the coexistence of the warm absorber together with the soft excess observed by bepposax .",
    "while doing that , we have noted that the interpretation of the asca data is complicated by a not yet perfectly understood , epoch - dependent , problem with the response in the asca - sis low energy channels ( t. yaqoob , private communication ) : the implication ( which is noted to be present , but with less of a consequence , in the asca observation of mcg  + 8 - 11 - 11 , grandi et al .",
    "1998 ) is equivalent to an additional @xmath64 of a few @xmath98 @xmath10 , which is largely incompatible with our data .",
