    "it is widely accepted that noise can facilitate the information processing capabilities of neurons @xcite .",
    "a well - known example is stochastic resonance ( sr ) , where a certain amount of noise can enhance the detection of weak signals in a neural medium @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for low noise levels the system is not able to detect a weak signal due to its small amplitude . for moderate noise levels",
    ", however , the noise enhances the signal up to a detection threshold .",
    "this makes the neurons respond in a manner that is strongly correlated with the signal .",
    "conversely , for strong noise , neural activity is highly variable and little correlated with the signal . this behavior of the neural response results in a bell - shaped dependence on noise , indicating that the correlation between the signal and neural activity is maximal around a moderate level of noise .    on the other hand , the repetitive spiking behavior of a single neuron driven just above its spiking threshold can be inhibited by the presence of noise , as was demonstrated by a series of theoretical studies @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the existence of a pronounced minimum in the average firing rate as a function of the noise level was reported .",
    "this noise - driven inhibitory effect has also been shown experimentally in _ in vitro _",
    "preparations of squid axons which operate as pacemakers @xcite .",
    "since the dependence of the neuronal response on noise is the opposite of that in the sr mechanism , this phenomenon is called inverse stochastic resonance ( isr ) .",
    "it is widely assumed that neurons transmit information and communicate with each other through spikes .",
    "thus , the emergence of isr can be seen as a limitation for information processing in neural systems . however",
    ", isr might play an important role in computational mechanisms that require reduced firing activity without chemical inhibitory neuromodulation , or alternatively , when other computational mechanisms require on - off bursts of activity @xcite . in this sense , isr may be advantageous for such particular cases .    in recent years , there has been a growing interest in studying different aspects of the isr phenomenon . for instance , guo @xcite investigated the influence of temporal noise correlations on isr , showing that colored noise suppresses neural activity more strongly than white ( gaussian ) noise .",
    "tuckwell and jost @xcite considered isr in a more realistic neuron model with spatial extent .",
    "they showed that if the signal and noise inputs overlap spatially on the neuron , then weak noise may inhibit spiking . if , however , the signal and noise are non - uniformly applied , then the noise has no effect on the spiking activity , no matter how large its region of application is .",
    "previous works on isr focused on external rather than endogenous noise sources @xcite .",
    "however , insofar as in vivo neural activity is inherently noisy @xcite , those works failed to account for the actual biophysical conditions and did not provide a clear understanding of the phenomenon under realistic conditions . in this context",
    ", recent studies have examined the possible biological mechanisms that might give rise to isr in actual neural systems .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , noise was considered to arise from the stochastic nature of voltage gated ion channels embedded in neural membranes . under this biophysically realistic scenario",
    ", the authors showed that isr can indeed arise in a single neuron due to ion channel noise , where its strength is proportional to cell membrane area ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the authors clarified the dynamical structure underlying the isr phenomenon .",
    "in another recent work @xcite , isr was studied using a detailed modeling approach for the synaptic background activity by assuming that spike transmission from presynaptic afferents to the postsynaptic neuron is unreliable , and it was shown that unreliable synaptic transmission might be a potential biophysical mechanism that gives rise to isr .    in the present study , we continue to investigate the isr phenomenon in a single neuron under more realistic conditions by considering the underlying noise as originating from the presynaptic background activity .",
    "stochastic neurotransmitter release , varying quantities of neurotransmitter resources at different synapses , and spatial heterogeneity of synaptic transmission along the dendritic tree @xcite can all modulate the neuron s postsynaptic response . collectively , these processes contribute to short- term synaptic plasticity , that is the transient change of synaptic efficiency on time scales from millisecond to minutes .",
    "short - term plasticity may come in different flavors , i.e. , short - term depression ( std ) and/or facilitation ( stf ) . from a mechanistic point of view in particular",
    ", std refers to the progressive reduction of synaptic neurotransmitter release by depletion of available neurotransmitter resources at the synapse @xcite .",
    "stf refers instead to transient increases of neurotransmitter release probability by activity - dependent presynaptic accumulation of intracellular ca@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "since these two synaptic mechanisms have been widely reported to be relevant for dynamics of neural circuits @xcite and various brain functions @xcite , here we investigate how short - term synaptic plasticity can influence the isr phenomenon . with this aim",
    "we analyze the response of a postsynaptic neuron that receives presynaptic inputs from a set of afferents through dynamic synapses with short - term synaptic plasticity and examine the influence of various parameters of the dynamic synapse mechanisms on different isr features .",
    "we show that when both std and stf mechanisms are included , a new intriguing phenomenon may be observed consisting of two isrs occurring at distinct presynaptic firing rates .",
    "we call this phenomenon double inverse stochastic resonance ( disr ) .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the possible computational implications of our findings for an actual neural system .",
    "the system under study consists of a postsynaptic neuron that receives uncorrelated network activity from a finite number of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic neurons through dynamical synapses .",

    "depending on the randomly - chosen initial condition , the neuron is attracted to either the spiking state or the resting state .",

    "[ fig1]b , which shows that the neuron remains in its initial state over the course of each trial .",
    "given the manner in which the initial condition is selected ( described above ) , the neuron is most likely to be initiated within the basin of attraction of the spiking state @xcite .",

    "the reason for this latter effect is that at high frequencies , @xmath38 becomes irrelevant because neurotransmitter resources rapidly deplete , especially if the recovery time is relatively long ( @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ uvar]a and @xmath76 in fig .  [ uvar]b ) .",
    "in contrast , at low and moderate @xmath19 values , there is more time for neurotransmitter resources to recover , and @xmath38 has more significant effects .",
    "thus we see that as @xmath38 increases , the curves for the various cases change position in relation to the horizontal lines that indicate the onset of the initial condition , trapping , and kickout effects described above .     (",
    "a )   ( b )     more specifically , for the std case , we see that increasing @xmath38 leads to a transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ uvar]c , from no isr ( circle ) to a single - well isr ( square and triangle ) and then to a weak double - well isr ( star ) . on the other hand , for the case with both std and stf , we observe that increasing @xmath38 results in the disappearance of the low frequency disr well , thus leading to a transition from double isr ( circle and square ) to a single - well isr ( star and triangle ) as shown in fig .",
    "such transitions arise in both cases from the sensitivity of @xmath49 to @xmath38 at low frequencies . as seen in fig .",
    "[ uvar]a and b , the left ends of the @xmath49 vs. @xmath19 curves increase with increasing @xmath38 at the low frequency end starting at @xmath89 , while the high frequency ends of @xmath49 vs. @xmath19 curves are not affected .",
    "for instance , in the case of only std , the leftmost values for @xmath90 lie close to the @xmath81 horizontal line , indicating essentially full trapping .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding @xmath67 values at @xmath89 decrease to zero as @xmath38 increases , and the left isr well gradually disappears .",
    "this observation also explains the transition from disr to single - well isr as @xmath38 increases in the case of competing std and stf ( compare fig .",
    "[ uvar]c and d ) .",
    "+      finally , we examine the effect of changing @xmath91 .",
    "isr emerges when the system dynamics exhibits bistability that includes a stable fixed point ( sfp ) , an unstable limit cycle ( ulc ) , and a stable limit cycle ( slc ) @xcite . for the hodgkin - huxley neuron ,",
    "this situtation is present for a modest range of constant input current @xmath91 .",
    "[ bifs ] illustrates the corresponding bifurcation diagram .",
    "specifically , the bistable range extends  in the absence of other current inputs  from approximately @xmath92 , where the slc and ulc are born by saddle - node bifurcation , to approximately @xmath93 , where the ulc and sfp merge in a hopf bifurcation ( see panel ( b ) ) . at this point",
    ", the sfp loses stability becomes an unstable fixed point ( ufp ) .",
    "the isr and disr results reported above were obtained with @xmath94 . in the neuronal context , the sfp and slc correspond to resting and spiking behavior , respectively , and the ulc mediates the boundary between the basins of attraction of these two stable states . within the bistable regime , the sfp and slc",
    "are not significantly affected by variation in the excitability control parameter @xmath4 , but it does significantly change the ulc , and correspondingly , the basin boundary @xcite . in particular , the basin of the sfp dramatically decreases in size as the ulc converges to the sfp as the hopf bifurcation is approached .",
    "therefore , we investigated the emergence of isr and disr for various values of @xmath4 near and within the bistable range .",
    "the results of our analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ varycurrentfigure ] for the case of ( a ) isr with std and ( b ) disr with both std and stf .",
    "( a )   ( b )     we see that increasing @xmath4 results , in both cases , in an overall increase of @xmath67 over the whole range of @xmath19 .",
    "this is as expected , since as the basin of the sfp shrinks to zero for increasing @xmath91 , a neuron in the resting state is more and more likely to be kicked into the basin of the spiking state ( i.e. , the slc ) and remain there @xcite .",
    "this increase of @xmath67 is most dramatic where the minima of the isr or disr curves are located , leading to a gradual flattening of the curve and the suppression of the isr or disr effect .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath95 , only the sfp exists , and the system is not bistable ( in the absence of other current inputs ) .",
    "accordingly , fig .",
    "[ varycurrentfigure](a ) shows that for this case , @xmath96 over the entire range of @xmath19 .",
    "however , in panel ( b ) , with both std and stf , we see that @xmath67 is not zero for intermediate values of @xmath19 for this case .",
    "the background activity triggers stf in this range , increasing @xmath40 such that the overall current input effectively places the neuron into the bistable regime where spiking behavior can occur .",
    "the firing frequency @xmath67 decreases back to zero for even higher frequencies due to the increasing std , which essentially cancels this effect .",
    "the aim of this work was to examine a neuron subject to a large number of presynaptic inputs , where presynaptic events occur stochastically .",
    "it has been shown that this source of noisy input gives rise to isr , and here we focused on the effects of dynamic synapses that exhibit short - term facilitation and depression .",
    "the key observation is that these synaptic dynamics lead to a non - monotonic relationship between the fluctuations in the postsynaptic current and the rate at which presynaptic events occur .",
    "then , with the qualitative understanding of the neuronal dynamics for varying values of noise , we developed a heuristic understanding of how isr rises , finding that , with the proper biophysical conditions , double isr could also be found .",
    "recent experimental works indeed reported the existence of isr in individual neurons @xcite , but the functional implications of such phenomena remain unknown partly because the experimental conditions for the observation of isr have not been systematically explored . in this",
    "regard , our study argues in favor of the emergence of isr by short - term synaptic plasticity , and suggests that experimental manipulation of the mechanisms underpinning such plasticity could lead to observable changes in biophysical correlates for isr in real neurons @xcite .",
    "although it is widely assumed that information is processed by spikes , the silent periods characterizing isr may also have functional relevance .",
    "for instance , isr may play a role in shortening the periods of anomalous working memory @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that purkinje cells involved in cerebellar computation could use isr to switch among different operating regimes depending on input current fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this leads to the speculation that isr mechanisms may generally provide a way for a neuron ( or a population thereof ) to be modulated by noisy inputs either without , or perhaps in conjunction with , stimulus - evoked signals . in this fashion ,",
    "the low average firing rate of postsynaptic neurons in the isr well could allow filtering of irrelevant information .",
    "this would facilitate neuronal tuning insofar as neurons could selectively process relevant information arriving from different inputs . and double isr may provide a mechanism in this direction that extends the possible biophysical conditions for which such selective tuning and multiplexing can be achieved .    in our study , we used the tsodyks - markham model of dynamic synapses , but we expect that any model that captures biophysical synaptic depression would lead to similar results . on the other hand , other biophysical factors can regulate synaptic activity in complex ways , such as in two - way synapse - astrocyte interactions @xcite",
    ". thus it might be interesting to explore the role of the mechanisms involved in such interactions ( i.e. , calcium dynamics ) on the emergence of isr and disr .",
    "it may also be possible to extend our study to investigate isr in simpler neuron models , such as two - dimensional models , to allow for theoretical analysis to determine , for example , the dependence of critical noise levels on different neuronal behaviors .",
