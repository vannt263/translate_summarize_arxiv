    "determining the ground state and properties of @xmath0 interacting particles in some fixed geometry is at the core of many disciplines in physics and other natural sciences .",
    "however , in general even for moderate values of @xmath0 , methods based on first principles are either intractable or extremely time - consuming .",
    "fortunately , the properties of many systems can be described by correlations that involve just a few particles and the problem of many particles can be reduced to consider a much smaller number in the background of the remaining particles .",
    "two - body interactions still have a tendency to make even such few - body problems very difficult to solve and insights gained from approximations that allow analytic treatments are therefore very useful .    in configuration interaction methods , where large basis states of properly symmetrized wave functions are built and diagonalized to determine system properties , a basis of harmonic oscillator states can be very convenient as matrix elements of the two - body interaction are easy to calculate .",
    "this approach was used early on in the context of the nuclear shell model @xcite . turning this method upside down the potentially complicated two - body interaction",
    "could be reproduced or simulated by a simple harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the great advantage is obviously that the coupled set of differential equations of motion are much simpler to solve , and a number of properties are easily systematically obtained as functions of interaction parameters and particle number .    in subfields of physics where the structure is already established at a given level of accuracy ,",
    "the insight gained from oscillator approximations is most often insufficient for improvements . however , in cold atomic gas physics it is now possible to prepare systems with very exotic and often unknown properties , to use controlled two - body interactions , to study different geometries and dimensions , and to vary trapping conditions @xcite .",
    "analytical oscillator approximations can therefore be expected to be very valuable , as it has been in other fields of physics .",
    "while we are concerned mainly with the quantum mechanical many - body problem here , we note that similar techniques are currently used also in the study of classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "obviously , the accuracy of the oscillator approximation increases as the potentials resemble oscillators .",
    "this means that pronounced smooth potential single minima with room for bound states are directly suited for investigations of system structures as functions of particle number and other characteristics .",
    "however , also much weaker binding potentials would reveal correct overall qualitative , and perhaps also semi - quantitative , behaviour in an appropriate oscillator approximation .",
    "this is especially emphasized by the universal behaviour of a number of weakly bound structures which only depend on integral properties like scattering length . in that case , the bulk part of the potentials are not crucial by themselves but rather the large distance effect or equivalently the tail of the wave function or the binding energy .",
    "all these quantities are related in the correct model descriptions but for specific purposes a subset may suffice .",
    "it seems clear that continuum properties like scattering behaviour are beyond the regime where useful results can be expected . still even phase shifts can be extracted from properly discretized continuum states @xcite .",
    "the harmonic oscillator has been used in virtually every aspect of physics where potentials are needed .",
    "still , in full generality , the procedure is not well described probably for several reasons .",
    "first , relative and center - of - mass ( cm ) motions are not separable even for two interacting particles with different masses in a trapping one - body potential .",
    "second , the simplest approximation for a self bound @xmath0-body system is found by the mean - field approximation where the spurious cm - motion is ignored .",
    "third , one- or two - body potentials centered at different points in space have only been of interest when the harmonic approximation is insufficient , as e.g. , in chemistry and for crystal structures .",
    "now optical lattices and split traps offer the possibility to also use multi - centered potentials .",
    "if only the relative motion is of interest , a decoupling scheme is necessary in order to separate the full solution to relative and cm - motions .    for cold atoms",
    "the oscillator approximation has been applied recently in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "these works considered bose - condensate properties for equal mass particles , and this is almost the only case where the center - of - mass motion separates . in this report",
    "we develop formalism to treat the most general harmonically interacting system for bosons ( or distinguishable particles ) . in turn",
    ", we solve the @xmath0-body problem for arbitrary quadratic forms of the one- and two - body interactions .",
    "the use of cartesian coordinates allows simple solutions for both one , two and three spatial dimensions , and any non - spherical behaviour of the corresponding potentials .",
    "first we derive the transformation matrices from initial to final particle coordinates where the differential equations are completely decoupled .",
    "we also derive expressions for various quantities like energies , root - mean - square radii , density matrix and its dominating eigenvalue .",
    "the hope is to provide simple tools to reveal at least qualitative features of the new and unknown systems under design and investigations particularly in the field of cold atomic gases .",
    "we demonstrate our method by finding solutions in two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) dimensions for @xmath0 identical and pairwise interacting bosons in external harmonic one - body potentials .",
    "the pairwise interactions are taken from the celebrated results of busch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for two particles with zero - range interaction in a harmonic trap , the validity of which have been tested in ultracold atomic gas experiments @xcite .",
    "our method thus provides an analytical approximation to the @xmath0-boson problem with short - range interactions .",
    "the condensate fraction is readily available from our calculations and shows interesting behaviour as the scattering length is tuned and the number of particles changes . in particular , at small positive scattering length we find a highly fragmented state in both two and three dimensions .",
    "we first define the hamiltonian in its most general quadratic form for both coordinates and kinetic energy derivative operators .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are omitted and symmetries of the spatial wave functions can in principle easily be imposed by permutations of the coordinates .",
    "we use matrices to simplify the derivations .",
    "we then derive the coordinate transformation to decouple the set of coupled oscillators and distinguish between cases where the cm motion is free and confined by one - body potentials .",
    "lastly , we calculate pertinent properties .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 , possibly different , particles of mass @xmath1 interacting through deformed harmonic potentials @xmath2 .",
    "the particles are in addition subject to external one - body potentials , @xmath3 , for each particle constructed as a sum of harmonic oscillators with different centers .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath4 with kinetic energy @xmath5 and potential @xmath6 is then given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the @xmath9-coordinates of the @xmath10th particle , @xmath11 is the reduced mass of particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the frequencies in the @xmath9-directions for the interaction potential between particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and ( @xmath15 ) are the frequencies in the @xmath9-directions for the one - body potential on the @xmath10th particle with centers specified by @xmath16 .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is made of two factors @xmath18 where one of them is the conventional notation for an oscillator potential .",
    "the other factor @xmath18 is to count the two - body interaction only once when the @xmath19 summations are extended to assume all integer values from @xmath20 to @xmath0 .",
    "the shift of the interaction centers , @xmath21 , for each pair of the two - body interactions should then change sign when the particles are interchanged , @xmath22 , which implies that the diagonal has to vanish , @xmath23 , in accordance with zero self interaction .",
    "this hamiltonian has the most general quadratic form expressed in terms of the parameters for one- and two - body oscillator potentials .",
    "the shift of potential energy , @xmath24 , of the energy for each pair allows adjustment without change of structure .",
    "the shifts of both one- and two - body oscillator centers suggest applications approximating optical lattice potentials .",
    "the frequencies traditionally all enter as squares which suggest attraction but the formalism is equally applicable for imaginary frequencies or equivalently negative values of these squared frequencies .",
    "to produce stable solutions with such repulsive interactions requires sufficient attraction from the other two - body interactions or from the external fields .",
    "the choice of cartesian coordinates allows independent solution for each dimension , and thereby treats deformations and different dimensions without any additional complications .",
    "obviously this also prohibits direct use of symmetries and conserved quantum numbers where the dimensions are mixed .",
    "one example is angular momentum conservation in the absence of external fields .",
    "we now proceed by rewriting the hamiltonian in matrix form . for this",
    "we define vectors , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where a vector is given as a column of its coordinates , which means the transposed of the row as indicated by `` @xmath5 '' . the @xmath27 and @xmath28-direction can be defined analogously if necessary .",
    "we treat each coordinate independently and may therefore omit the @xmath29-index to simplify the notation in the derivation .",
    "the @xmath29-part of the hamiltonian , @xmath30 , in - is given by : @xmath31 where the kinetic energy matrix , @xmath32 , is diagonal and depends only on inverse masses .",
    "the constant term , @xmath33 consists of the sum of all separate shift energies : @xmath34 the quadratic potential term in contains the symmetric matrix @xmath35 which is given in terms of masses and frequencies by @xmath36 the components of the coefficient vector @xmath37 in the linear term are @xmath38    the @xmath27 and @xmath28-parts of the hamiltonian , @xmath39 , are completely analogous and we have @xmath40 .      the linear term in can be eliminated by translating the coordinates by @xmath41 where the translation vector @xmath42 is determined by the requirement that all terms linear in @xmath43 must vanish from the hamiltonian",
    ". this condition amounts to @xmath44 . as containing only second derivatives the kinetic energy operator remains unchanged by this linear translation . in total",
    "the hamiltonian in the new coordinates has only the same quadratic terms in both coordinates and derivatives .",
    "however , linear terms have disappeared and the term , @xmath45 , should be added to @xmath33 in .",
    "any solution , @xmath42 , to @xmath46 eliminates the linear terms .",
    "many solutions always can be found , but a unique solution only exists when @xmath35 is non - singular , that is @xmath35 is invertible .",
    "a singular @xmath35-matrix is equivalent to a subset of non - interacting particles which also all are unaffected by the one - body potentials .",
    "then the corresponding degrees of freedom are already decoupled and following the trivial motion in free space . as already decoupled they",
    "should therefore from the beginning be removed from the reduction procedure .",
    "the dimension of the @xmath35-matrix is correspondingly reduced .    in practice ,",
    "only one frequently occurring example is interesting and requiring special attention .",
    "this is when all interactions are translation invariant and only depending on coordinate differences between particles .",
    "then the center - of - mass motion is as in free space .",
    "external one - body fields acting on all particles act on the center - of - mass coordinate and remove the corresponding degeneracy .    previous works with oscillators @xcite considered equal mass systems where separation of the center - of - mass motion is straightforward . here",
    "we provide a general procedure valid for all sets of masses and all one- and two - body interactions . in all cases we transform to relative and center - of - mass , @xmath47 ,",
    "coordinates , where the latter is defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total mass of the system .",
    "choosing the new set of coordinates , @xmath50 , by @xmath51 , for @xmath52 , supplemented by @xmath53 , we define the transformation matrix , @xmath54 , by @xmath55 where the transformation matrix takes the form @xmath56 the specific labelling singles out the @xmath57th ( last ) particle with mass , @xmath58 , in the transformation @xmath54 .",
    "the inverse transformation , @xmath59 , from original to new coordinates is explicitly given by @xmath60    the hamiltonian is now easily transformed to the new set of coordinates , by direct insertion of for the coordinates and the inverse and transposed , @xmath61 , for the derivative kinetic energy operators , @xmath62 .",
    "the kinetic energy immediately separates into a sum of relative and center - of - mass dependent terms , whereas the potential part separates when it is translationally invariant , and otherwise not . in any case",
    "these coordinates can be used in the following derivations .",
    "we assume that we have the quadratic form without linear terms .",
    "we transform to relative and center - of - mass coordinates in all cases even though we could have worked with the initial coordinates .",
    "we rename the coordinates and omit the primes in the following expressions .",
    "we begin by diagonalizing the quadratic part of the potential , which then is the @xmath63 matrix ( see , and ) .",
    "the orthonormal coordinate transformation @xmath64 corresponding to the diagonalization is defined by the requirements @xmath65 where @xmath66 is diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath35 is singular at least one of the eigenvalues , @xmath67 , is zero , as when the interactions only depend on relative coordinates .",
    "one of these zero eigenvalues then has an eigenvector corresponding to the center - of - mass coordinate .",
    "this mode now has to be fully decoupled after the kinetic energy is expressed in the same coordinates .",
    "this is achieved in general by replacing the zero eigenvalue by any finite number .",
    "if only relative motion is of interest the hilbert space spanned by this eigenvector should simply be removed .",
    "we proceed to perform a new non - orthonormal transformation of the coordinates defined by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is diagonal and given by @xmath70 .",
    "the number @xmath71 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "we choose to maintain the total norm which implies that @xmath72 .",
    "this transformation is nothing but scaling the lengths of each of the eigenvectors to let @xmath69 become proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "the transformation from @xmath29 to @xmath73-space of the derivative vector is then given as @xmath74 .",
    "the kinetic energy matrix in the @xmath73-coordinates is @xmath75 , where the space corresponding to the center - of - mass coordinate decouples from all the other degrees of freedom .",
    "this kinetic energy matrix is diagonalized , i.e. @xmath76 where the orthonormal transformation @xmath77 , or @xmath78 , is chosen to make @xmath79 diagonal , i.e. @xmath80 , or equivalently diagonalize @xmath81 .",
    "this final orthonormal transformation leaves the potential energy part as a diagonal matrix with unchanged diagonal elements , i.e. @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the diagonal unit matrix with elements @xmath84 , which defines the output frequencies , @xmath85 .",
    "this is a factorization return to the ordinary oscillator notation by using the masses determined from the kinetic energy eigenvalues in .",
    "if in the process of transforming from the original @xmath86- cordinates to the @xmath87 coordinatees zero eigenvalues were generated , then care must be taken to make sure sure that they do not contribute to any final observable .",
    "this is easily achieved with @xmath88 for these modes .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the @xmath29-coordinate is now a set of decoupled oscillators in the new coordinates @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath89 where we inserted the label @xmath29 on masses , oscillator parameter and @xmath90-coordinates .",
    "the harmonic oscillator eigenvalues and eigenfunctions correspond to the frequencies @xmath91 and the length parameter @xmath92 as usual given by @xmath93 .    in total the transformation @xmath49 from initial to new coordinates and vice versa are @xmath94 the normal mode of the system",
    "is expressed by the eigenvector , and the corresponding eigenvalue indicates the ease or difficulty of exciting that particular normal mode .",
    "observables expressed as expectation values of operators @xmath95 are found by @xmath96 where the wave functions are simplest in the transformed coordinates while the operators probably are simpler in the original particle coordinates .",
    "we have only considered the spatial wave function @xmath97 .",
    "effects of spin dependence of interaction or quantum statistics have to be inserted separately .",
    "the wave functions are products of the three one - dimensional harmonic oscillator wave functions in the new coordinates , that is gaussians , @xmath98 , times hermite polynomials with arguments @xmath99 for each contributing mode @xmath13 .",
    "other analogous products arise from the @xmath27 and @xmath28-directions .",
    "the normalization is as usual when we use the final ( @xmath100 ) coordinates in the wave function .",
    "all the above transformations , including that of the non - orthonormal matrix , @xmath69 , was chosen as total norm conserving .",
    "therefore the volume elements have the same structure in initial and new coordinates , i.e. @xmath101 .    the expectation value of the hamiltonian gives the energy , which for the eigenmode , @xmath13 , of given quantum number , @xmath102 , is @xmath103 . adding the similarly obtained results from the @xmath27 and @xmath28-direction we get the total energy for a given set , @xmath104 , of quantum numbers @xmath105 where the frequencies of the non - contributing modes are inserted as zero .    beside energies the simplest observables are sizes , i.e. average values of the interparticle distance(s ) in the system .",
    "the spatial extension of the probability for each particle is measured by its root mean square radius . with the relation in we find for the ground state @xmath97 @xmath106 where we used that the odd powers of the coordinates vanish after integration .",
    "if the center of mass coordinate @xmath47 is decoupled we exclude that term in the summation , and the resulting sum is the computation of the expectation of @xmath107 .",
    "the other dimensions should be added .",
    "the simplest correlation function is the one - body density matrix , @xmath108 , which is the starting point of the calculation of statistical properties .",
    "it is interesting in itself but serves here also as a simple illustration of analytical calculations .",
    "the one - body density matrix is relevant for bosons ( or distinguishable particles ) which is our main application of the method to be discussed in the subsequent section . for fermions ,",
    "the one - body density matrix is a rather uninteresting object due to the pauli principle and off - diagonal long - range order ( as arising for instance from pairing ) is determined by the two - body density matrix @xcite . while we do not consider fermions explicitly in the current presentation , we address the general issue of symmetrization in the subsection below for completeness .",
    "note here that we have taken great care to remove the center - of - mass coordinate so that only intrinsic coherence is studied .",
    "this is particularly important if @xmath0 is very small @xcite or if the system is subjected to a temporally or spatially varying additional potential @xcite .",
    "the ground state wave function is a product of gaussians in the new coordinates , @xmath87 with different units of length @xmath109 .",
    "the exponent can be written @xmath110 where the matrix @xmath111 is diagonal with elements @xmath112 .",
    "using we return to the initial coordinate where @xmath113 which defines the matrix @xmath114 when we assume all interaction centers are at the origin .",
    "the exponent of the density matrix for identical bosons , where we select the particle labeled @xmath20 , is then @xmath115 to integrate over all other coordinates ( from @xmath116 to @xmath117 ) than @xmath118 and @xmath119 we complete the squares .",
    "we define the vector @xmath120 , for @xmath121 and make the substitution @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is the @xmath114 matrix without the first row and column . after integration we are left with the density matrix @xmath125 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the normalization , @xmath126 is @xmath127 going further , we can re - write the exponent as @xmath128 where the ratio @xmath129 is given as @xmath130 this ratio determines the largest eigenvalue , @xmath131 , obtained after diagonalization of the density matrix , i.e. @xmath132 where the subscript @xmath29 is to remind us that this expression is valid for one dimension . in more dimensions the wave functions are products and consequently also the density matrix and its eigenvalues .",
    "thus for example in three dimensions , we have @xmath133 the size of this eigenvalue is the established measure for the content of condensate in the wave function .",
    "the remaining eigenvalues can be found in terms of the largest one : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a non - negative integer @xcite .",
    "we thus see that if @xmath131 is close to one then all other eigenvalues will fall off very fast , whereas for small @xmath131 one has a distribution of many non - zero eigenvalues and a highly fragmented state .",
    "the solutions discussed above are all obtained without any requirements of symmetry due to groups of identical particles in the system .",
    "the hamiltonian necessarily must commute with correponding permutation operators , and the solutions should then have the proper symmetry .",
    "it is then only a question of selecting those states among the complete set of all solutions .",
    "unfortunately , this tempting conclusion is wrong in general because it is based on the assumption of non - degenerate states .",
    "degeneracies allow mixing of different symmetries , which implies that the solutions are linear combinations of the required symmetries .",
    "thus , a simple method to restore the required symmetry is to construct linear combinations of the available solutions with the same energy .",
    "we have assumed that the hamiltonian is independent of intrinsic properties like spin of the particles .",
    "this means that the total wavefunction factorizes into intrinsic ( including particle spins ) and spatial parts .",
    "here we only consider the symmetries of the spatial part which subsequently has to be combined with the remaining parts of the wavefunction .",
    "the task is not easily formulated in general since the system may consist of different groups of particles each with their own symmetry requirement .",
    "this could be a combination of identical bosons and fermions , or identical particles placed in different geometries by external fields and consequently effectively behaving as non - identical particles .    to illustrate the method we assume that all particles are identical , or alternatively we omit reference to the non - identical particles left in their orbits while only considering those explicitely mentioned in the following formulation .",
    "we write the symmetrized or antisymmetrized spatial wavefunction @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the coordinate for particle @xmath12 , @xmath139 is a permutation of the set of numbers @xmath140 , @xmath141 is a normalization constant and @xmath142 is @xmath143 for spatial ( boson ) symmetry , and @xmath144 for even and odd permutations @xmath139 , respectively , when we construct wavefunctions with spatial ( fermion ) antisymmetry .",
    "the energy of @xmath136 is given as the energy , @xmath145 from eq.([160 ] ) , which is the same for each term of @xmath136 .",
    "this conclusion is due to the fact that the hamiltonian is invariant under these coordinate changes , and the energy of the state in eq.([e124 ] ) is the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the wavefunction in eq.([e124 ] ) may be identically vanishing , e.g. when a symmetric , @xmath97 , is antisymmetrized or vice versa , when an antisymmetric , @xmath97 , is symmetrized . in these cases",
    "the state , @xmath136 , does not describe any physical system .",
    "the procedure can be specified in more details with matrix manipulations .",
    "if the coordinate transformation corresponding to one of the permutations in eq.([e124 ] ) for one of the cartesian coordinates , @xmath29 , is described by @xmath146 , i.e. @xmath147 ( with @xmath25 ) , we can express the equivalent transformation in the final coordinates by @xmath148 , with @xmath49 defined in eq.([e143a ] ) .",
    "thus by replacing @xmath87 by @xmath149 in the arguments of the terms in the wavefunctions in eq.([e124 ] ) the same variables @xmath87 are used as in the unpermuted term .",
    "the same coordinates are then used to express all terms in the full ( anti)symmetrized wavefunction    the permutations leave the exponent in the wavefunction unchanged , i.e. @xmath150 .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath151 oscillator frequencies , masses and lengths are identical .",
    "the last length is related to the center of mass motion , which either has to be omitted without confining field or remains invariant under the permutations as decoupled from the intrinsic motion described by the @xmath151 frequencies .",
    "the hermite polynomials change arguments but remain polynomials of the same order in the new coordinates @xmath149 . in total , each term in eq.([e124 ] ) is a different polynomial of the same order in the coordinates corresponding to the permutation .",
    "the expectation value of an arbitrary operator is then very difficult to find due to the many terms .",
    "operator expectations are then analytic if they can be found in an oscillator basis , and in particular this is the case for any polynomial structure of the coordinate or momentum operators . however , in general the expectation values may consist of many terms .",
    "small excitations leave only few different oscillator quanta in the wavefunction .",
    "the non - vanishing terms in eq.([e124 ] ) are then limited to rather few .",
    "the extreme case is the state with all @xmath152 which is completely symmetric under all permutations , that is only one term describing the ground state for identical bosons",
    ". this case will be our main concern in the remaining part of the paper . when all quanta are equal to zero except one with an arbitrary @xmath153 , the number of different permutations are @xmath0 , which is a manageable number .",
    "another practical limit is when the number of identical particles effectively is small , e.g. when identical particles are confined by external fields to different states or spatial locations .",
    "then only very few permutations are present , and the brute force method is easily applicable . in any case",
    "the brute force methods are only necessary when information beyond the energy is required .",
    "more suitable procedures can no doubt be designed for specific systems and corresponding operators , as for instance discussed recently in the context of the hyperspherical harmonic approach @xcite .",
    "however , all derivations can still be made analytically if the operator expectations are calculable for oscillator states .",
    "two particles interacting in a trap is obviously the simplest non - trivial system of @xmath0 interacting particles .",
    "still very interesting features for two particles were discovered for the extreme limit of a contact interaction and a confining trap potential @xcite . it would not be surprising if an oscillator approximation has difficulties in a quantitative description of such systems .",
    "on the other hand this is a challenging problem , and the structure of @xmath0 particles in a trap with such pairwise interactions are an active field of research .",
    "we shall therefore attempt to extract systematic overall features within our analytical formalism .",
    "the philosophy is to reproduce the two - body properties as close as possible , and then systematically calculate properties of the many - body system .",
    "several other approaches have been used for few - body systems of atoms interacting via the contact interaction . among these",
    "are effective field theory approaches @xcite , shell - model @xcite , and monte carlo calculations @xcite in three dimensions for fermions , various hyperspherical and variational approaches in three @xcite and in two dimensions for bosons @xcite , and exact diagonalization in two dimensions for fermions @xcite and for bosons @xcite",
    ". the zero - range interaction does not allow the diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian in spatial dimensions greater than one , so all these methods must address that in some way .",
    "most often , this manifests as a cut - off to a particular subspace , which effectively renormalizes the interaction strength @xcite . in @xcite , a gaussian form of the interaction",
    "is used to approximate the zero - range potential , and only repulsive interactions are considered . with the exception of @xcite ,",
    "all discuss energy results as a function of model space size , and do not yet discuss other observables .",
    "first we must decide how to choose the parameters in the oscillator model .",
    "for two identical bosons we have initially five parameters , i.e. mass , interaction frequency , energy shift , confining frequency , and center position of the confining field .",
    "one of these can always be chosen as a scale parameter or a unit without consequences for any of the properties . in the present case , the external field",
    "is provided by its frequency , @xmath154 , independent of the two - body interaction , which then leave the interaction frequency , @xmath155 for all @xmath19 , and the energy shift , @xmath156 for all @xmath19 , to be determined .",
    "these parameters all identical since we consider indistinguishable particles .",
    "we can also immediately set the center position of the confining field to zero , as there is no such center shifting or multi - center effect in the external field in the original two - body problem .",
    "our strategy will be to reproduce the ground state properties of the model of busch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite as much as possible using a harmonic oscillator .",
    "we work exclusively in the domain where the lowest state is the molecular branch that represents a bound state when the trap is removed .",
    "the population of this particular state was considered previously in @xcite . in three dimensions",
    ", this means that we consider only the positive scattering length side of the resonance , whereas in two dimensions this branch is always present .",
    "this procedure provides our effective mapping from the two - body interaction to the solvable @xmath0-body problem .",
    "we note that our choice of branch means that for large scattering lengths the two - body energy goes to @xmath157 ( three dimensions ) and @xmath158 ( two dimensions ) , where @xmath154 is the external field frequency . for small scattering lengths",
    "it goes as the inverse of the scattering length squared in both cases , since it represent the universal bound state that is also present when @xmath159 .",
    "the hamiltonian , solved in @xcite for two particles , is @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the mass of the particles , @xmath154 is the external trap frequency as mentioned above , @xmath162 is the relative coordinate @xmath163 and @xmath164 is the scattering length of the two - body potential assumed to be a regularized @xmath165-function .",

    "the particles are much more tightly bound with strong correlations .",
    "again this is consistent with the fact that we have very strongly bound two - body states in this limit that are very different from the non - interacting harmonic states .     at several different values of the 3d scattering length as a function of particle number . from top to bottom , the ratios plotted are : @xmath205,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the question of whether a true condensate actually exists in a realistic quasi-2d setup with harmonic trapping potentials below a certain critical temperature @xcite will not be addressed here .",

    "we discuss the energies of the degenerate frequencies which is the amount of energy required to excited the modes .",
    "unfortunately , the degeneracy is itself an obstacle for understanding the uncoupled structures of single excitations .",
    "the reason is that any wave function expressed as a linear combination of the same energies is equally well qualified .",
    "the set of normal modes only has to be orthogonal , but that can be achieved in infinitely many ways .",
    "one general exception is if other conserved quantum numbers have to be restored by specific linear combinations of the degenerate states .",
    "angular momentum is a prominent example in the absence of external fields .",
    "we now discuss what determines the degeneracy , or equivalently what would break it .",
    "first , if all masses , all two - body interaction frequencies , and all one - body frequencies are equal , then @xmath151 degenerate frequencies are produced along with the one - body frequency , which is returned unchanged . if masses are changed , then the degeneracies are broken , and if @xmath207 masses are changed then all degeneracies will be broken .",
    "this is the same for the one - body frequencies ( those in ) , if @xmath207 of them are different from each other , then all the output frequencies will be different .    for the interaction frequencies in the situation is slightly more complex",
    ". if one row and column in the @xmath35-matrix of have the same interaction frequency , i.e. , if this particle interacts the same with all other particles , then there will be at least one pair of degenerate frequencies .",
    "in general , of the @xmath208 interaction frequencies ( off - diagonal elements of the @xmath35-matrix ) , if @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) of them are different , then that is enough to guarantee all symmetries are destroyed .",
    "however , all degeneracies can be broken with a wiser distribution of the different frequencies . if , for example , the frequencies immediately above the main diagonal of @xmath35 are all different and all the remaining ones being the same ( a total of @xmath0 different off - diagonal frequencies ) , then that is enough to destroy all degeneracies of the resulting normal modes .    thus , degeneracy can be broken or reached through many different paths .",
    "the structure of the resulting degenerate normal modes depends on the chosen path .",
    "we still find it interesting to investigate specially selected normal modes .",
    "if all particles are distinguishable it should in principle be possible to observe corresponding vibrational structures where each particle is detected . to probe the underlying structure , revealed by the normal modes , we therefore approach the degenerate limit from an entirely non - degenerate system .",
    "the two simplest ways are to differentiate the particles by minute differences in mass , or alternatively in one - body frequency .",
    "we first notice that the normal modes are the results of transforming the set of oscillators to diagonal form .",
    "the energies and eigenvalues are obtained from the matrix depending on masses , external field frequency , and two - body interaction frequency .",
    "thus by choosing all these parameters to be identical the normal modes in two and three dimensions are the same .",
    "this is achieved by the same masses , same external field , and corresponding choices of scattering lengths in 2d and 3d such that the two - body interaction frequencies from are identical .",
    "the correspondence is seen in where both scattering lengths are small at the same time and also increase simultaneously .",

    "it is clear from the figure that it is possible to map 3d results onto 2d results , but the reverse is not always true .",
    "this is due to the different behaviour of the systems for large scattering length , where the energy and square radius of the two - body system are controlled by the properties of the external trap . in two dimensions",
    "we find that @xmath215 when @xmath206 and then tells us that we have to choose @xmath216 , i.e. we have a non - interacting system . for three dimensions ,",
    "the situation is somewhat different as the virial theorem applied for @xmath206 , tells us that @xmath217 . from",
    "we deduce that @xmath218 , i.e. our harmonic equivalent is an interacting system still .",
    "this also implies that the interaction frequency in 3d , @xmath176 in , can never be smaller than @xmath219 . in 2d , there is no lower limit for the interaction frequency and it eventually vanishes at a large enough scattering length where the external field determines all properties .        from we can in principle from a series of 2d calculations for different scattering lengths extract 3d results .",
    "the procedure is to start with the desired 3d scattering length , find the corresponding 2d scattering length , read off the related 2d results for normal modes , radii , and oscillator energy shift .",
    "the normal modes and radii are now the 3d results , and the 3d energy is obtained by finding the related 3d oscillator energy shift from combined with the expression in .",
    "the procedure can be reversed provided the desired 2d scattering length is within the range accessible to conversion from 3d ( i.e. , @xmath220 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian we obtain in our oscillator approximation can be decoupled by a change of coordinates as discussed above .",
    "the normal modes can therefore be viewed in one dimension at a time as the amplitudes with which each of the individual particles are moved when the corresponding mode is excited on top of the ground state .",
    "more explicitly , consider exciting the @xmath12th mode with probability @xmath139 , so that the wavefunction of the system becomes @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the frequency of mode @xmath12 .",
    "the displacement in time is then @xmath223 , with amplitude given by @xmath224 .",
    "we illustrate the modes pictorially below .",
    "the fact that the different spatial directions are decoupled also implies that a spherical external field produces degenerate modes .",
    "this degeneracy can be lifted by deforming the field but such a symmetry breaking would only reflect the properties of the field .",
    "we therefore consider the one - dimensional eigenmodes which apply for both @xmath211 and @xmath214 when using a correspondence of scattering lengths down to @xmath225 as was done between @xmath211 and @xmath214 in .    in and we show a sequence of modes for six and eight particles respectively .",
    "the dependence on scattering length is rather weak for both small and large @xmath226 .",

    "we also computed the critical number of particles that can form a self bound system of negative energy .",
    "this number increases with increasing scattering length . in three dimensions",
    "this happens already for a few particles while in two dimensions more than 50 bosons are needed for large scattering lengths .    as a novelty",
    ", we considered the normal modes which are characteristic properties of any system .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath0-boson system , there is a large degree of degeneracy that can obscure the detailed behaviour .",
    "the ambiguity due to degenerate eigenmodes is circumvented by breaking the symmetry and then approaching the limit of full degeneracy for the identical boson system .",
    "a different way of breaking the symmetry is to deform the external field but the resulting eigenmodes then reflect precisely the chosen deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "we then computed the one - dimensional oscillatory eigenmodes which can be related to equivalent values of the scattering lengths in two and three dimensions .",
    "what we found in the normal modes was an interesting tendency for the particles to cluster in smaller groups and then perform motion with respect to other such groups .",
    "this implies that excitations can induce strong correlations in a many - boson system even when all interactions are equal .",
    "the method that we have presented in this report is completely general and can be applied to systems in external fields or to self - bound structures .",
    "the treatment of deformation of the trap or the two - body interaction is straightforward and we expect that rotation of the external trapping potential poses no problem as well .",
    "while we have only treated bosons in this work , the extension to fermions is achieved through proper ( anti- ) symmetrization of the wave function and also bose - fermi mixtures are accessible . with the possibility of having displaced centers we can also apply the method for split traps , and also even more exotic geometries with mixed dimensions which are under current study within fermi - fermi mixtures of ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "our method can also be applied to cold polar molecules , in particular to the case where two - dimensional confinement is induced to make layered systems @xcite where non - trivial two- and three - body bound states appear in the bilayer @xcite that open for study of various exotic many - body states in both bilayer and multi - layer systems @xcite .",
    "the form of the dipolar potential has harmonic oscillator shape in the inner part when particles are confined in multi - layers and we therefore expect the the method presented here to readily provide analytical results valid for intermediate and strong dipolar strength . the fact that normal modes are easily accessible with the harmonic method presented makes this even more interesting .",
    "this can help understand the modes of excitation in chains and complexes for use in thermodynamic calculations of system properties .    in conclusion",
    ", the analytic solutions of coupled harmonic oscillators can be used to study the overall properties of @xmath0-body systems and structures can be calculated in general from two - body properties for different particle number and geometries .",

    "<S> energy eigenvalues , eigenmodes , and correlation functions like density matrices can then be computed analytically . as a first application of our formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the @xmath0-boson problem in two- and three dimensions where we fit the two - body interactions to agree with the well - known zero - range model for two particles in a harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , condensate fractions , spectra , radii , and eigenmodes are discussed as function of dimension , boson number @xmath0 , and scattering length obtained in the zero - range model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that energies , radii , and condensate fraction increase with scattering length as well as boson number , while radii decrease with increasing boson number . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism is completely general and can also be applied to fermions , bose - fermi mixtures , and to more exotic geometries . </S>"
