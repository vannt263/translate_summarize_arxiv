    "many network arhitectures encountered in nature or used in applications are described by their degree distributions . in other words , if @xmath0 denotes the fraction of vertices having @xmath1 incident edges , then the shape of the function @xmath0 distinguishes certain network classes .",
    "for example , in the classical random graphs studied by erds and rnyi @xcite , @xmath0 has a binomial distribution , which converges to a poisson distribution for large network sizes .",
    "the degree distribution of regular networks , where every vertex has the same degree @xmath2 , are given by the delta function @xmath3 , whose small perturbations by random rewiring introduce small - world effects @xcite .",
    "many common networks , such as the world - wide web @xcite , the internet @xcite , and , networks of protein interactions @xcite have been shown to have approximate power - law degree distributions , and have been termed _ scale - free _ @xcite .",
    "the power grid has exponentially distributed vertex degrees @xcite .",
    "some social networks have distributions similar to a power - law , possibly with some deviations or truncations at the tails @xcite .",
    "a recent survey is given in @xcite .",
    "these examples demonstrate the recent widespread effort in classifying common large networks according to their degree distributions .    in many applications ,",
    "the vertices of networks have internal dynamics , and one is interested in the time evolution of a dynamical system defined on the network .",
    "a natural question is then what , if anything , the degree distribution can say about the dynamics on the network .",
    "asked differently , to what extent does a classification according to degree distributions reflect itself in a classification according to different qualitative dynamics ?",
    "the question is all the more significant since many large networks are constructed randomly .",
    "hence , in essence every realization of , say , a power - law distribution is a different network . on the one hand , it is conceivable that the dynamics on different realizations could be sufficiently different . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that these realizations can have certain common characteristics ; for instance , small average distances and high local clustering found in small - world networks @xcite .",
    "consequently , the relation between the degree distribution and the dynamics is not trivial .",
    "the present work studies this relation in the context of a specific but important dynamical behavior of networked systems , namely synchronization .",
    "it is well - known that the synchronization of diffusively - coupled systems on networks is crucially affected by the network topology . in particular , the so - called spectral gap , or",
    "the smallest nontrivial eigenvalue @xmath4 , of a discrete laplacian operator plays a decisive role for chaotic synchronization : larger values of @xmath4 enable synchronization for a wider range of parameter values , in both discrete and continuous - time systems @xcite , and also in the presence of transmission delays @xcite .",
    "here we shall prove that , given any degree distribution satisfying certain mild assumptions , a connected network having that distribution can be constructed in such a way that @xmath4 is inversely proportional to the number of edges in the graph .",
    "hence , there exist large networks with these degree distributions which are arbitrarily poor synchronizers .",
    "the proof is based on ideas from degree sequences of graph theory , and in particular makes use of the relation between @xmath4 and the cheeger constant of the graph .",
    "it applies to the class of distributions that include the classical random ( poisson ) , exponential , and power - law distributions , as well as nearest - neighbor - coupled networks and their small - world variants , and many others .",
    "thus , we establish that the degree distribution of a network does not suffice to characterize the synchronizability of complex dynamics on its vertices .",
    "our proof is constructive in nature .",
    "hence , from another perspective , it can be viewed as an algorithm for designing non - synchronizing networks having a prescribed degree distribution .",
    "this may have implications for engineering systems which should essentially operate in asynchrony , such as the internet , where synchronized client requests can cause congestion in the data traffic through servers or routers , or neuronal networks where synchronization can be sign of pathology . furthermore , the non - synchronizing networks that we construct can actually have quite small diameters or average distances .",
    "this proves that the informal arguments which refer to efficient information transmission via small distances as a mechanism for synchronization are ill - founded . for a related discussion based on numerical studies of small - world networks , see @xcite .",
    "here we give a rigorous proof for a much larger class of distributions .",
    "in the following we consider finite graphs without loops or multiple edges . as mentioned above , the degree distribution @xmath0 gives the fraction of vertices having @xmath1 incident edges .",
    "a related notion is that of a _ degree sequence , _ which is a list of nonnegative integers @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the degree of the @xmath7th vertex .",
    "we also denote the largest and smallest degrees by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . for each graph",
    "such a list is well - defined , but not every list of integers corresponds to a graph .",
    "a sequence @xmath10 of nonnegative integers is called _ graphic _ if there exists a graph @xmath11 with @xmath12 vertices for which @xmath13 are the degrees of its vertices .",
    "@xmath11 is then referred to as a _ realization _ of @xmath14 .",
    "a characterization of graphic degree sequences is given by the following .",
    "[ @xcite][havel - hakimi ] for @xmath15 , the nonnegative integer sequence @xmath14 with @xmath12 elements is graphic if and only if @xmath16 is graphic , where @xmath16 is the sequence with @xmath17 elements obtained from @xmath14 by deleting its largest element @xmath8 and subtracting 1 from its @xmath8 next largest elements .",
    "the only @xmath18-element graphic sequence is @xmath19 .",
    "often one is interested in connected graphs , and the following result gives the correspondence between degree sequences and connected realizations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ connected seq ] a graphic sequence @xmath14 with @xmath12 elements has a connected realization if and only if the smallest element of @xmath14 is positive and the sum of the elements of @xmath14 is greater or equal than @xmath20 .",
    "one of the simplest degree sequences belong to @xmath2-regular graphs , in which each vertex has precisely @xmath2 neighbors . here , the degree sequence is given by@xmath21 there is a simple criterion for such constant sequences to be graphic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    [ regular ] a sequence @xmath22 with @xmath12 elements where @xmath23 is graphic if and only if @xmath12 or @xmath2 is even .",
    "the construction of _ small - world _ networks starts with a @xmath2-regular graph with @xmath2 much smaller than the graph size @xmath12 , e.g. , a large circular arrangement of vertices which are coupled to their near neighbors .",
    "then a small number of edges @xmath24 are added between randomly selected pairs of vertices @xcite .",
    "when @xmath25 , the degree of a vertex typically increases by at most one , which yields the degree sequence @xmath26 where @xmath27 vertices have degree @xmath28 . in a variant of the model @xcite , randomly selected edges are _ replaced _ by others , so the degree of a vertex may increase or decrease by one , and the degree sequence becomes @xmath29 where the number of vertices having degree @xmath28 or @xmath30 are each equal to @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , there is also the possibility of having some vertex degrees increase or decrease by more than one , in which case the sequences ( [ sw1 ] ) and ( [ sw2 ] ) are modified accordingly , while the sum of the degrees remain equal to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "in addition to these well - known graph types , we shall also consider more general sequences , which we define as follows .     definition : :    a sequence @xmath14 with largest element    @xmath8 is called a _ full sequence _",
    "if each integer    @xmath1 satisfying @xmath33 is an    element of @xmath14 , and the sum of the elements of    @xmath14 is even .",
    "we also give a criterion for full sequences to be graphic .",
    "[ scale - free degreeseq ] let @xmath34 be a full sequence with @xmath12 elements and @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath14 is graphic .",
    "we prove by induction on the number of elements of @xmath14 .",
    "this is trivial for the full sequence with two elements .",
    "suppose that every full sequence with at most @xmath36 elements and largest element not larger than @xmath37 is graphic .",
    "let @xmath14 be a full sequence with @xmath38 elements and largest element @xmath39 .",
    "we look at the sequence @xmath16 that is defined in lemma [ havel - hakimi ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath16 is a full sequence .",
    "let @xmath40 be the largest element of @xmath16 .",
    "by the definition of @xmath16 , @xmath41 .",
    "we claim that@xmath42 for if @xmath43 , then@xmath44 this implies @xmath45 so the number of @xmath8 s in @xmath14 is at least @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath14 is a full sequence , the number of its elements is then@xmath47 implying @xmath35 , which contradicts ( [ qq22 ] ) .",
    "thus , ( [ qq21 ] ) holds .",
    "then @xmath16 is graphic by induction , and by lemma [ havel - hakimi ] @xmath14 is graphic .",
    "the reason for introducing the concept of full sequences is that many common graph types have full degree sequences .",
    "for instance , large random graphs of erds - rnyi have their vertex degrees distributed according to the poisson distribution @xmath48 since such networks are randomly constructed , ( [ poisson ] ) is understood to hold in the limit as the network size increses while @xmath49 is kept constant . in scale - free networks ,",
    "the degree distribution follows a power law @xmath50 for some @xmath51 .",
    "the exponential distribution obeys @xmath52 with @xmath53 . of course",
    ", in any finite graph these distributions are truncated from the right since the maximum degree is finite , and then one has @xmath54 for @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the sum of the vertex degrees is always even since it is twice the number of edges in the graph .",
    "therefore , large finite graphs approximated by these distributions , or more generally by any distribution satisfying @xmath54 for @xmath33 , have realizations with full degree sequences . ] . in the next section ,",
    "we prove that the regular and small - world sequences ( [ reg])-([sw2 ] ) , full degree sequences , as well as their variants where some degrees may be missing , have a realization which is a poor synchronizer .",
    "furthermore , the synchronizability of this realization worsens with increasing graph size .",
    "the synchronization of dynamical systems is usually studied in diffusively coupled equations , which in discrete - time may have the form @xmath55   , \\;i=1,\\dots , n.\\label{coupled}%\\ ] ] in ( [ coupled ] ) , @xmath56 denotes the state of the @xmath7th unit , which is viewed as a vertex of a graph , and has @xmath6 neighbors to which it is coupled .",
    "the notation @xmath57 denotes that units @xmath7 and @xmath58 are coupled , which is represented in the underlying graph by an edge .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 is a differentiable function and @xmath60 quantifies the coupling strength .",
    "a solution @xmath61 of ( [ coupled ] ) is said to synchronize if @xmath62 for all @xmath63 the synchronization manifold @xmath64 defined by the conditions @xmath65 is an invariant manifold for ( [ coupled ] ) , and clearly the trajectories starting in @xmath64 synchronize . in case @xmath64 is an attracting set , the system ( [ coupled ] ) is said to synchronize , and one distinguishes between different types of synchronization depending on the nature of the attractor @xcite .",
    "for example , when @xmath59 is a chaotic map @xmath64 may contain an attractor in the weak milnor sense @xcite , that is , for some set of initial conditions with positive lebesgue measure , and the corresponding behavior is then termed weak synchronization .",
    "systems similar to ( [ coupled ] ) arise also in continuous time in different applications . for a general introduction",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the effect of the network topology on synchronization is determined by the properties of the coupling operator . for ( [ coupled ] ) , the relevant operator is the ( normalized ) laplacian with matrix representation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees and @xmath68 $ ] is the adjacency matrix of the graph , defined by @xmath69 if @xmath57 and zero otherwise .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath70 are real and nonpositive , which we denote by @xmath71 .",
    "zero is always an eigenvalue , and has multiplicity 1 for a connected graph .",
    "the smallest nontrivial eigenvalue , denoted @xmath4 , is called the spectral gap of the laplacian , and is the important quantity for the synchronization of coupled chaotic systems .",
    "larger values of @xmath4 enable chaotic synchronization for a larger set of parameter values .",
    "this result holds in both continuous and discrete time , for the laplacian ( [ laplacian ] ) that we consider here , as well as the combinatorial laplacian @xmath72 @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall show how to construct a graph having a prescribed degree sequence and an arbitrarily small spectral gap , that is , a poor synchronizer .",

    "we denote the cardinality of a set @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78 is the number of edges of @xmath11 . for a subset @xmath79",
    ", we define @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the number of edges with one endpoint in @xmath76 and one endpoint in @xmath82 .",

    "in certain cases , it may require some effort to obtain connected realizations for the partitions @xmath91,@xmath92 . nevertheless , by arguments similar to the above",
    ", it is not hard to show that if @xmath91 has a realization with @xmath171 components , then it is possible to construct a realization @xmath11 of @xmath14 such that @xmath4 is essentially given by @xmath172 .",
    "so , the basic construction is indeed applicable to even more general cases and distributions than we have considered here . on the other hand ,",
    "it should be kept in mind that certain degree sequences are not amenable to such manipulation , in particular those that have a unique representation .",
    "for instance , the @xmath12-element sequences @xmath173 and @xmath174 correspond uniquely to the complete graph @xmath175 and the star @xmath176 , respectively ; hence the value of @xmath4 is uniquely determined for them .",
    "we conclude this section with an example illustrating the main ideas .",
    ": :    consider a constant degree sequence @xmath177    of @xmath178 elements , where @xmath179 .",
    "we split it    into two constant sequences    @xmath180 each with    @xmath12 elements .",
    "since either @xmath12 or    @xmath17 is even , both subsequences are graphic by    lemma  [ regular ] and have connected realizations    @xmath170 by lemma  [ connected seq ] .",
    "in fact , in this    special case the realization is unique :    @xmath181 , the complete graph on @xmath12    vertices where each vertex is connected to the remaining    @xmath17 .",
    "we now remove one edge each from    @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and rewire to construct    the structure shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , i.e. , a connected graph    @xmath11 having the original degree sequence @xmath14 .",
    "the subgraphs @xmath170 are complete graphs each    missing an edge . to show that @xmath11 has a small spectral    gap , theorem  [ thm : regular ]",
    "can be invoked to obtain the    bound@xmath182    which is plotted in figure  [ fig:2 ] against @xmath12 , together    with the true values of @xmath4 .",
    "the figure shows    that @xmath4 decreases rapidly with increasing graph    size , and is in fact estimated very well by the upper bound ( [ est ] )    for large @xmath183 in this special case the estimate ( [ est ] )    can actually be somewhat improved , but",
    "the point is that the value of    @xmath4 is on the order of @xmath184 for    large @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that the average distance in    the constructed graph @xmath11 is small and approaches 2 as    @xmath185 , and the maximum distance between any    two vertices is equal to 3 . despite these small distances ,",
    "@xmath11 is a poor synchronizer even at moderate sizes    @xmath12 .     for the graph constructed in example .",
    "we have shown that the degree sequence is generally not sufficient to characterize the synchronizability of a network .",
    "the method of proof is based on the construction of a graph which has a specified degree distribution and a small spectral gap for the graph laplacian . the construction works for a wide class of degree distributions , including poisson , exponential , and power - law distributions , regular and small - world networks , and many others .",
    "thus , sychronizability is not an intrinsic property of a degree distribution .",
    "furthermore , small diameters or average distances in a graph do not necessarily imply synchronization , since the poorly - synchronizing graphs we construct can have small diameters , as the above example shows .",
    "the method of proof presented here is essentially an algorithm to construct a graph with a given degree distribution and a small spectral gap .",
    "such a poor - synchronizing realization of a degree distribution is certainly not unique .",
    "an interesting query is then finding how many poor - synchronizers there are , as compared to all realizations of a given distribution ?",
    "this turns out to be a difficult question . in general",
    "it is not easy to estimate of the number of realizations of a given degree sequence .",
    "mckay and wormald @xcite give an estimate that depends on the maximum degree .",
    "to state their result , let @xmath10 be a degree sequence without zero elements , @xmath186 entries of value @xmath18 , and @xmath187 entries of value @xmath188 . if @xmath189 @xmath190 and @xmath191 , then the number of the realizations of @xmath14 is asymptotically@xmath192 where @xmath193 @xcite .    as an attempt to apply this result to the case considered here , let @xmath194 be a full degree sequence with @xmath178 elements and @xmath195",
    "be one of the partitions with @xmath12 elements such that @xmath196 .",
    "then the ratio of the number of realizations @xmath91 to @xmath14 is approximately ( by using @xmath197 @xmath198 where @xmath199 . for a certain partition",
    "@xmath91 the ratio is very small . on the other hand",
    "it is hard to give an estimate on the number of suitable partitions like @xmath91 that make @xmath4 very small .",
    "hence , at this point there seems to be no general estimates for the relative size of poor - synchronizers belonging to the same degree sequence , and the question remains open for future research .    at any rate ,",
    "it is clear that care is needed when making general statements about the synchronizability of , say , scale - free networks , even in a statistical or asymptotical sense . in this context",
    "it is also worth noting that most results about the scale - free architecture are based on the algorithm of barabsi and albert @xcite , which , by way of construction , possibly introduces more structure to affect the dynamics than is reflected in its power - law degree distribution .",
    "in fact , another preferential attachment type algorithm introduced in @xcite yields also graphs with power - law degree distributions , but significantly smaller first eigenvalues than those constructed by the algorithm of barabsi and albert or random graphs .",
    "while the algorithm of @xcite lets nodes receive new connections with a probability proportional to the number of connections they already possess , the one of @xcite introduces new nodes by first connecting to an arbitrary node and then adding further connections that complete triangles , that is , to nearest neighbors of nodes already connected to .",
    "since the probability to be a nearest node of another node is also proportional to the number of links a nodes possesses , that algorithm also implements a preferential attachment scheme and therefore produces a power - law graph .",
    "the small first eigenvalues reported in @xcite agree with our more general results in showing that it is possible to construct power - law graphs with arbitrarily small spectral gap .",
    "furthermore , this observation holds regardless of the exponent in the power law .",
