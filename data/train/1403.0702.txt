    "quantum field theories ( qfts ) contain infinitely many degrees of freedom and therefore we can define so many kinds of observables in general . among them , entanglement entropy is a very helpful quantity especially when we would like to study global structures of any given quantum field theory .",

    "the reduced density matrix @xmath1 is defined from the original density matrix @xmath3 by tracing out the subsystem @xmath4 which is the complement of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , we can quantify topological properties by computing topological contributions in entanglement entropy , so called topological entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "one may wonder if there is a sort of topological contribution in entanglement entropy even for gapless theories , especially conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to extract such a quasi - topological quantity from ( both renyi and von - neumann ) entanglement entropy of excited states in two dimensional rational cfts .",
    "refer to an earlier work @xcite for a connection between the topological entanglement entropy and boundary entropy and to @xcite for the one between the boundary entropy and entanglement entropy .",
    "the @xmath5-th renyi entanglement entropy is defined by s^(n)_a=[_a^n ] .",
    "the limit @xmath6 coincides with the ( von - neumann ) entanglement entropy .",
    "we are interested in the difference of @xmath7 between the excited state and the ground state , denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "replica calculations of @xmath8 for excited states defined by local operators have been formulated in @xcite . in particular",
    ", we will closely follow the construction in @xcite , which can be applied to qfts in any dimensions .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite . indeed , this quantity is topological as the late time values of @xmath8 do not change under any smooth deformations of subsystem @xmath2 @xcite . also as we will see",
    ", this quantity gets non - trivial owing to a global structure of conformal blocks of cfts .",
    "consider an excited state which is defined by acting a primary operator @xmath9 on the vacuum @xmath10 in a two dimensional cft . we employ the euclidean formulation and introduce the complex coordinate @xmath11 on @xmath12 such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the euclidean time and the space , respectively .",
    "we insert the operator @xmath9 at @xmath15 and consider its real time - evolution from time @xmath16 to @xmath17 under the hamiltonian @xmath18 .",

    "[ scak ] this is depicted in fig.[fig : sa2 ] .",
    "the reason why we find the trivial result for @xmath57 is because the excited state @xmath59 can be regarded as a direct product state @xmath60 in the left - moving ( l : chiral ) and right - moving ( r : anti - chiral ) sector @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not an entangled state .    on the other hand , @xmath58 creates a maximally entangled state ( or equally einstein - podolsky - rosen state ) : @xmath61 , which carries the renyi entropy @xmath62 for any @xmath5 @xcite . at @xmath63",

    "when @xmath45 or @xmath66 , both fragments live in @xmath4 and thus the entropy vanishes .",
    "this argument based on the causal propagations explains the result ( [ scak ] ) .",
    "this behavior is universal for any primary operators in any cfts as is clear from ( [ fgf ] ) , though the explicit value of renyi entropy for @xmath65 depends on the choice of operator and cft as we will study below .     for @xmath58 .",
    "we set @xmath67.,width=226 ]    in general cfts , the function @xmath68 can be expressed using the conformal blocks @xcite : g_a(z,|z)=_b(c^b_aa)^2f_a(b|z)|f_a(b||z ) , where @xmath69 runs over all primary fields . in our normalization",
    ", the conformal block @xmath70 behaves in the @xmath71 limit : f_a(b|z)=z^_b-2_a(1+o(z ) ) , @xmath72 is the conformal dimension of @xmath73 .    since we found @xmath74 when @xmath45 or @xmath66 , we get the behavior @xmath75 , as the dominant contribution arises when @xmath76 i.e. when @xmath73 coincides with the identity @xmath77 . applying ( [ fgf ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath56 , as expected from the causality argument .",
    "to analyze the entropy when the causality condition @xmath65 is satisfied , we need to apply the fusion transformation , which exchanges @xmath78 with @xmath79 ( or equally @xmath51 with @xmath80 ) : f_a(b|1-z)=_cf_bc[a]f_a(c|z ) , [ ftr ] where @xmath81 $ ] is a constant , called fusion matrix @xcite . in the limit @xmath82 , we obtain g_a(z,|z)f_00[a](1-z)^-2_a|z^-2_a . therefore we find the following expression from ( [ fgf ] ) : s^(2)_a =- f_00[a ] .    moreover , in rational cfts , based on the arguments of bootstrap relations of correlations functions @xcite , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath83 $ ] coincides with the inverse of the quantity called quantum dimension @xmath84 : f_00[a]== , [ qdm ] where @xmath85 is the modular @xmath86 matrix of the rational cft we consider . in this way",
    "we obtain the remarkably simple result for two dimensional rational cfts : s^(2)_a = d_a , when @xmath65 .",
    "for example , if we consider the @xmath87 unitary minimal model and choose @xmath88 to be the @xmath89 primary operator @xcite , we can explicitly confirm ( [ ftr ] ) and ( [ qdm ] ) using the expressions of four point functions in @xcite and @xmath38 for @xmath65 is found to be s^(2)_a=.",
    "the @xmath5-th renyi entanglement entropy can be obtained from the formula ( [ replica ] ) by computing the @xmath26 point functions .",
    "owing to the previous discussions , since we are interested in the non - trivial time period : @xmath65 , we can assume the limit @xmath90 and employ the simple conformal map @xmath91 .",

    "the number of primary fields contained in the operator product of @xmath99^k$ ] is estimated as @xmath100 when @xmath33 is very large ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it should be interpreted as an effective degrees of freedom included in the operator @xmath27 and our results give a clear manifestation of this statement using the ( renyi ) entanglement entropy .",
    "for example , in the ising model ( i.e.(4,3 ) minimal model ) , there are three primary operators : the identity @xmath101 , the spin @xmath102 and the energy operator @xmath103 .",
    "since the quantum dimension is zero for @xmath101 and @xmath103 , @xmath8 is always vanishing for these .",

    "in conclusion , we derived the simple formula ( [ finf ] ) for both renyi ( @xmath106 ) and von - neumann ( @xmath107 ) entanglement entropy at late time .",
    "the essence of our proof was that the time evolution performs the fusion transformation only in left - moving sector . more generally if we consider a product of primary operators @xmath108 , we obtain @xmath109 , using the sum rule in @xcite .",
    "note that the quantum dimension @xmath84 satisfies @xmath110 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the topological entanglement entropy @xcite also has the same contribution @xmath111 in the presence of anyons .",
    "however , our result shows that this contribution arises in an explicit dynamical systems defined by two dimensional rational cfts , where the consideration of time evolution played an important role .",
