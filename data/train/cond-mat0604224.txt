    "in recent years mesoscopic ferromagnet - superconductor ( fs ) hybrid structures have been studied very extensively.@xcite these structures provide the possibility for the controlled studies of the coexistence of the magnetic and superconducting orderings in the presence of the phase coherent effects .",
    "the motivation also has come from the interesting potential applications , such as the proposal of the so called @xmath0-sfs josephson junctions@xcite as the solid state qubits.@xcite the properties of a normal metal ( n ) in close contact with an s , find superconducting characteristics due to the penetration of the superconducting correlations ( induced order parameter ) inside the normal metal .",
    "this proximity effect is rather specific in an f metal , in which the interplay between the spin splitting exchange interaction and the singlet superconducting correlations makes the induced superconducting order parameter to have a spatial damped oscillatory behaviour.@xcite one of the manifestations of this effect is that the density of states ( dos ) of an f layer in contact to s oscillates with varying the thickness and amplitude of the exchange field of the f layer.@xcite the oscillations of the proximity dos in thin f layers with different thicknesses have been observed in experiments.@xcite    the proximity effect in f is rather short range as compared to a normal metal case in which the superconducting correlations can penetrate over the normal coherence length @xmath1 . here @xmath2 is the fermi velocity and we use the units in which @xmath3 . when the exchange field @xmath4 is homogeneous , the induced order parameter contains the singlet component and also a triplet component with the zero projection @xmath5 of the total spin.@xcite these components can survive in a clean f only over a short distance @xmath6 from the fs interface . in spite of this observation",
    "there have been experiments@xcite in which the superconducting proximity effect in f are reported which have an amplitude and range much stronger and longer than what the above described theory predicts .    in a pioneering work bergeret",
    "et al.@xcite studied the possibility of a long range proximity in ferromagnets with a local inhomogeneous magnetization .",
    "they showed that in the presence of a nonhomogeneous spiral magnetization vector close to the fs interface a triplet component of the superconducting order parameter with projections @xmath7 can be generated in addition to the singlet and the triplet @xmath5 components .",
    "these triplet components are not affected by the exchange splitting and can spread over a long distance of the normal coherence length @xmath8 .",
    "very recently new experimental evidences of the long range superconducting correlations in ferromagnets have been reported .",
    "sosnin et al.@xcite observed the superconducting phase - periodic conductance oscillations of a ferromagnetic ho wire at a magnetic phase with a conical magnetization vector , in contact with the al superconducting ring .",
    "they found that the phase coherent oscillations sustain for the ho wire lengths up to 150 nm at @xmath9k , which is much longer than @xmath10 nm . there has been also reports of observing josephson supercurrent in sfs contacts with stronger cro@xmath11 ferromagnetic contacts at even longer distances @xmath12 m , by group of klapwijk in delft.@xcite in order to explain such long range effects , they refer to the generation of the bergeret s triplet component with @xmath7 , due to the inhomogeneity of the magnetization .    in order to induce the long range triplet components @xmath7 in f from a singlet superconducting condensate in s ,",
    "the nonlocal noncollinear orientation of the magnetization vectors is essential .",
    "the triplet correlations will not be induced for a collinear configuration of the magnetization vector . in this paper",
    "we study the possibility of a long range superconducting proximity effect in a ferromagnetic structure with collinear magnetization vectors .",
    "we consider a clean fs proximity system in which f consists of two layered domains f@xmath13 and f@xmath11 whose magnetization vectors are pointed antiparallel to each other and are separated by a sharp domain wall of negligible width ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . using the quasiclassical eilenberger equation,@xcite we calculate the superconducting pair amplitude function ( order parameter ) and the proximity dos in the structure",
    ". the pair amplitude function ( paf ) spatially oscillates within each domain with a period which is determined by the amplitude of the local exchange field .",
    "we find that while in f@xmath13 the amplitude of the paf oscillations decreases with the distance from s , in f@xmath11 it can increase over a distance which depends on an effective exchange field determined by the thicknesses and the exchange fields of f@xmath13 and f@xmath11 .",
    "when f@xmath13 and f@xmath11 have the same thicknesses and exchange fields , the paf oscillations are amplified over whole of f@xmath11 and reaches to the value of the paf for the corresponding ns structure .",
    "we can understand this effect by noting that a quasiparticle travelling through f with a given spin state will gain additional phases in f@xmath13 and f@xmath11 due to the exchange field splittings .",
    "since the exchange fields are oriented antiparallel to each other the phases gained in f@xmath13 and f@xmath11 will have opposite signs , leading to a phase cancellation and suppression of the exchange fields effect .",
    "the similar effect was found before in josephson sfs junctions with f having a domain structure.@xcite we further study the effect of this phase cancellation in the local proximity dos at the fermi level .",
    "we show that it has an oscillatory behaviour with respect to the exchange field and the thickness of f@xmath11 .",
    "the oscillations are amplified up to the values of the thickness and exchange field which cancels the phase effect of f@xmath13 completely . at this point",
    "the dos goes to zero corresponding to the normal metal case .",
    "this kind of long range penetration differs from the one introduced by bergeret et al .",
    ", as it has an oscillatory behaviour and is superposition of the singlet and triplet components with @xmath14 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce our model of the ferromagnetic domain structure ( fds ) in contact with an s and present solutions of the eilenberger equation for the quasiclassical green s functions . in sec .",
