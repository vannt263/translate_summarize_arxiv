    "gox has been also an attractive material for large scale graphene production@xcite due to low - cost , simple and high yield reduction methods .",

    "et al.__@xcite revealed that 100% coverage of gox is energetically less favorable than 75% coverage .",
    "also , while a coverage less than 25% of gox contains only hydroxyl groups , the mixed gox consisting of both oxygen and hydroxyl is favored for higher coverage . in a later study , yan _ et al_.@xcite suggested that it is energetically favorable for the epoxy and hydroxy groups to aggregate together to form specific types of strips with @xmath0 carbon regions in between .",

    "for example , yet the distribution of hydroxy and epoxy groups on gox surface together with the trends related with their clustering or uniform coverage are unknown .",
    "at least , a rigorous explanation for the reason of the differences in the interpretations of experimental data is required .",
    "in particular , it is not clear why the desorption of oxygen adatoms through o@xmath5 formation does not occur so easily despite the negative formation energy of oxygen adsorption . unlike gox",

    "we present an extensive analysis of the oxygen adsorption and oxygen coverage by using first principles calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) . in order to understand the reversible oxidation - deoxidation processes@xcite we consider only oxygen adatoms on graphene surfaces , in spite of the fact that hydroxyl groups are readily coadsorbed .",
    "earlier studies have followed approaches , which consider the optimized geometries corresponding to the minimum of total energy . here",
    ", we show that the mechanism of oxygen coverage is governed mainly by the charge density profile of graphene , which is modified by each adsorbed oxygen in the course of oxidation . at the end ,",
    "oxidized regions of graphene tend to form domains instead of a uniform coverage . in view of these results",
    "we also discuss unzipping process of graphene.@xcite the oxygen adsorption on both sides of graphene was shown to be energetically more favorable than the adsorption to only one side , whereby serious distortions of the graphene lattice occurred .",
    "the repulsive interaction between two oxygen adatoms at the close proximity is repulsive and hinders oxygen desorption through o@xmath5 formation .",
    "we finally showed that the distribution of oxygen atoms on graphene affects the electronic properties .",
    "even if the massless dirac - fermion behavior of graphene can be recovered for patterns conserving specific symmetries , the band gap normally increases with increasing non - uniform oxygen coverage and attains the value as high as 3 ev .",

    "a thorough analysis of the interaction of single o atom with graphene is essential to understand the oxidation process . here",
    "the adsorption of single ( isolated ) oxygen on graphene is represented using large supercells , where o - o interaction is minimized .",
    "owing to its hexagonal crystal structure , there are three major sites for foreign atom adsorption on graphene as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the hollow ( h ) site is above the center of hexagonal rings formed by carbon atoms .",
    "the top ( t ) site lies on top of the carbon atoms and the bridge ( b ) site is above the middle of each bonds connecting two adjacent carbon atoms .",
    "the bridge site is found to be most favorable adsorption site for an oxygen atom .",
    "earlier lda calculations predicted also b - site as energetically favorable site.@xcite the variation of the total energy along h @xmath8 t @xmath8 b sites is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the energy barrier is 0.6 ev for an o atom diffusing from bridge to top site and the energy difference between bridge and hollow site is as high as 2.56 ev .",
    "therefore , the migration paths of oxygen adatom with minimum energy barrier follow the honeycomb structure over the c - c bonds by going from b- to t - sites as illustrated by inset in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy barrier against the penetration of an oxygen adatom from one side of graphene to the other side is as high as 6 ev.@xcite this high energy barrier suggests that graphene can be used an ideal coating preventing surfaces from oxidation .",
    "we note that the hollow site of graphene is more favorable for other atoms@xcite such as li or ti , while h and f atoms prefers the top site for adsorption.@xcite    the binding energy of oxygen on graphene is defined as    @xmath9 + e_{t}[o ] - e_{t}[gr+o]\\ ] ]    where @xmath10,e_{t}[gr],e_{t}[o]$ ] denote the optimized total energies of graphene with adsorbed oxygen , pristine graphene and free o atom , respectively .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath11 ev for the ( 2x2 ) graphene supercell containing 8 carbon and one oxygen atom , but it increases to 2.40 for ( 3x3 ) and to 2.43 for ( 4x4 ) supercells . for supercells larger than ( 4x4 ) , which correspond to smaller oxygen coverage and",
    "hinders o - o coupling , the binding energy does not change and mimics the binding energy of single , isolated oxygen attached to graphene surface .",
    "the calculated binding energy for full coverage @xmath4=0.5 ( namely the ratio , @xmath3 , @xmath12=0.5 ) is 2.80 ( 3.34 ) ev per oxygen atom for one - sided ( two - sided ) adsorption .",
    "the binding energy of single oxygen adatom increasing from 2.43 ev to 2.80 ev at full coverage indicates a significant o - o coupling .",
    "we note that the formation energy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the binding energy of o@xmath5 molecule ) is negative for one - sided coverage indicates instability .",
    "however , this situation does not impose desorption of o through o@xmath5 formation for reasons discussed in sec .",
    "v.    according to the pauling scale , oxygen has an electronegativity of 3.44 , which is the second highest in periodic table after fluorine ( 3.98 ) and hence the oxidation of graphene is expected to result in significant charge transfer between oxygen and carbon atoms .",
    "our calculations using bader analysis@xcite estimates a charge transfer of 0.79 electrons from carbon atoms of graphene to oxygen .",
    "this charge is mainly transferred from the nearest two carbon atoms forming the bond above which the oxygen adsorbed at bridge site , while some nearby oxygen atoms also contribute to the charge transfer .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] ( c ) shows isosurface and isovalue ( contour ) plots of total charge for a plane passing through carbon atoms and oxygen .",
    "the direction of electron density increasing from carbon atoms towards oxygen atom is a clear indication of charge transfer .",
    "in addition , two carbon atoms below oxygen are slightly raised from the plane of other carbon atoms and the charge distribution of the bond between them is disturbed .    in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( d ) birds - eye view of isosurface and isovalue of charge density profile of a single oxygen adsorbed to each ( 5x5 ) supercell of graphene is presented .",
    "the structure is symmetric and the oxygen atom is at the center .",
    "we label some of the bonds corresponding to nearby bridge sites as b1,b2,b3,b4 and denote their equivalent sites by primes . while the isosurface plots of all c - c bonds of bare graphene are identical , the adsorption of single oxygen modifies the charge distribution at its close proximity . in fact",
    ", the isosurfaces plotted for 0.3 ( electron / @xmath15 ) @xcite show that the electron population of specific bonds are higher .",
    "as clearly seen from the figure , b2 and b3 bonds contain more electrons than in b1 and b4 bonds .",
    "the reason for the electron depletion in these bonds is related with the donation of electrons from these bonds to adsorbed oxygen .",
    "interestingly , the bonds b2 , b3 and their four images contain more electron density compared to b1 and other bonds further away from the oxygen atom . for a better illustration of bond charge alternation",
    ", we also presented the isovalue plot of total charge density in the upper triangle of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( d ) .",
    "again , the more isolines in the isovalue map corresponds to more charge at b2 and b3 compared to b1 and b4. in this context , we note that the long range interactions and friedel oscillations found in 1d carbon chain@xcite and 2d graphene@xcite induced by adatoms . finally we include the density of states ( dos ) plot in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( e ) for the system presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the overall total dos represents a profile similar to bare graphene dos making a dip near the fermi level corresponding to dirac points and dos projected to oxygen atom is represented by a peak around -2.5 ev .",
    "later we show that the electronic density and band gap will change with oxygen coverage .",
    "in contrast to oxygen atom , an oxygen molecule has a weak binding with graphene .",
    "we calculated its binding energy to be 115 mev which consists of 57 mev van der waals interaction@xcite and 58 mev chemical interaction .",
    "its magnetic moment is 1.90 @xmath17 , slightly smaller than the magnetic moment of free o@xmath5 due to weak chemical interaction .",
    "the @xmath16 molecule lies parallel , approximately 3  above the graphene plane , and do not induce any distortions to graphene honeycomb structure as in the case of single oxygen adsorption .",
    "accordingly , the binding of o@xmath5 to graphene is specified as physisorption .",
    "it is therefore concluded that graphene can not be oxidized directly by o@xmath5 molecule unless its dissociation into oxygen atoms takes places at the vacancy site.@xcite",
    "starting from single oxygen adatom , we next consider the adsorption of more oxygen atoms one at a time on graphene surface leading to higher coverage of oxygen .",
    "we exclude the hydroxyl groups in the present study to simplify the situation and hence to reveal essential aspects of oxygen adsorption . in order to reduce the effects of cell size ,",
    "we construct a larger rectangular supercell containing 128 carbon atoms as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the isosurface charge density profile for rectangular supercell is similar to the charge density profiles in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( d ) with @xmath18 and @xmath19 bonds having more charge compared to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "for the adsorption of second oxygen , we try all inequivalent bridge sites and calculate their total energies .",
    "it turns out that , the energetically most favorable site for the second oxygen adsorption is at @xmath18 site in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( a ) .",
    "in addition , the calculated binding energy of the second oxygen is around 2.9 ev and this is even higher than the binding energy of single oxygen on graphene .",
    "the binding energy is 154 mev lower for adsorption on @xmath19 .",
    "the binding energy at @xmath22 site is equal to the single oxygen binding energy .",
    "but interestingly , @xmath20 and @xmath21 sites are energetically less favorable sites for second oxygen adsorption compared to other sites .",
    "the calculated @xmath23 is 2.33 ev for @xmath20 site .",
    "these calculated energies indicate a direct correlation between the binding energies and isosurface profiles given in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( a ) .",
    "apparently an oxygen atom prefers the bridge sites , where the electron density is highest compared to other available sites .    the charge density isosurface profile of graphene supercell containing two oxygen atoms is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( b ) and this profile can be used to predict the energetically favorable and unfavorable sites for the adsorption of third oxygen .",

    "the third oxygen is bound to @xmath24 site with @xmath28 ev which is slightly higher for the maximum binding energy of second oxygen .",
    "the binding energies at @xmath26 and @xmath27 are approximately 0.7 ev smaller than the binding energy at @xmath24 site . for the case of fourth oxygen , @xmath29 site in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( c ) having more bond charge compared to other sites is energetically most favorable .",

    "the favorable binding energy for fifth oxygen can be predicted as @xmath31 from fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( c ) .",
    "the oxidation process of graphene for more than four oxygen is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( e ) and ( f ) up to 12 oxygens adatoms .",
    "the main trend is that each oxygen added to system prefers the bridge sites containing higher bond charge . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we included the ordered configuration for 12 adatoms in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( f ) .",
    "however , this configuration ( right ) is significantly less energetic , by 1.46 ev compared to to the random configuration on the left . we continue to examine the growth of the domain consisting of 12 atoms by adding oxygen atoms to the system .",
    "the 13@xmath32 oxygen inserted to the system ( not shown in figure ) prefers the bridge site on the bond having highest electronic charge , but not the third bridge sites stacking eventually three oxygen atoms along a line of bridge sites of consecutive parallel c - c bonds .",
    "there are two such possible sites in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , which are identified as the precursors of unzipping ( where the usual angle of c - o - c bridge bond increases by breaking ( or weakening ) the c - c bond underneath,@xcite are energetically unfavorable by @xmath330.9 ev .",
    "the 14th oxygen atom behaved like the previous one : instead of occupying two possible sites of precursor states , it is adsorbed to a different bridge site which is energetically 614 mev more favorable .    clearly , the final structure is a domain of oxygen adatoms on graphene for @xmath34 0.5 and hence it lacks the signatures of any uniform coverage which is present for the case of hydrogen and flourine adsorption on graphene . in the case of oxygen , adatoms arrange themselves on graphene starting from a single adatoms .",
    "subsequently , additional ones seek energetically most favorable sites clustering around the existing ones .",
    "this domain structure the binding energies of the last adsorbed oxygen atom ( or @xmath35 adsorbed oxygen ) is calculated from the expression @xmath36 = ( e_{t}[n-1 ] + e_{t}[o ] ) - e_{t}[n]$ ] in terms of the minimum total energies of @xmath37 and @xmath38 oxygen atoms adsorbed on the same supercell of graphene .",
    "for any @xmath38 , the lowest total energy ( with negative sign ) @xmath39 $ ] and hence highest binding energy ( with positive sign ) @xmath36 $ ] is determined by comparing the calculated energies of @xmath35 oxygen adatom when adsorbed to sites remained from the domain of adsorbed @xmath40 oxygen atoms .",
    "once oxygen adatoms nucleate a domain they prefer to grow it by including additional oxygen atoms , whereby uniform oxidation of graphene surface is precluded .",
    "this conclusion is attained by calculating the total energy of a single domain consisting of 12 oxygen atoms formed on a large graphene supercell consisting 256 carbon atoms and comparing it with the total energy of two separate domains of 6 oxygen atoms nucleated at two different locations on the same supercell .",
    "the growth of a single domain is found to be favored by 330 mev compared to the growth two separate domains .",
    "it should be noted that the present analysis is done under the condition , where sequential adsorption of oxygen adatoms achieved in equilibrium .",
    "however , oxidation is a stochastic process comprising processes or events taking place in nonequilibrium .",
    "therefore , growth of multiple domains at finite temperature may occur , but the uniform growth appears to be a case of least probability .    in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( g ) , the calculated binding energy , @xmath36 $ ] exhibits an oscillatory variation for @xmath41 and @xmath42$]=3.1 ev .",
    "these oscillations are physical since energetically favorable site for the @xmath38th adsorbed oxygen and the resulting @xmath23 are well - determined and unique , but not equivalent to previous sites .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath23 originate from the changes of the charge distribution and distortions of c - c bonds on the graphene surface occurred as a result of adsorbed oxygen atoms forming a domain .    at this point",
    ", we note that the energetic sites of two and three oxygen adatom in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] is in agreement with the adsorption sites found by yan and chou@xcite as well as by sun and fabris.@xcite however , the ground state configuration of freely adsorbed oxygen atoms forming a domain comprising four or more atoms in fig .

    "[ figure2 ] comprising a domain of 8 oxygen atoms we obtained a configuration consisting two b - sites occupied by oxygen atoms on the adjacent parallel c - c bonds , which can be a precursor of unzipping if subsequently adsorbed oxygen atoms occupy additional adjacent b - sites on a line and they overcome an energy barrier to increase c - o - c bond by breaking the c - c bond underneath .",
    "however , next adsorbed oxygen as well as 13@xmath32 and 14@xmath32 stopped to develop the precursor state and preferred different sites .",
    "we note that at finite temperature and in the presence of other external effects oxygen atoms are prone to develop precursors of unzipping by deviating fro above sequence of adsorption taking place in equilibrium . later in sec .",
    "vii we discuss this issue further .",
    "we also note that patterns of oxygen coverage for @xmath12=0.5 predicted by the genetic algorithm@xcite can not be directly comparable with the nonuniform coverage in the present study , which determines the most energetic sites when oxygen atoms are adsorbed on graphene sequentially one at a time .      in order to test the stability of oxygen covered region in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( f ) , we also performed finite temperature , ab - initio molecular dynamics calculations .",
    "the nose thermostat is used and the time steps are taken 2.5 femtoseconds .",
    "atomic velocities are normalized at every 40 time steps and calculations lasted for 10 picoseconds at 1000 k for supercell containing 128 carbon atom and 10 oxygen adatoms . at the end , this structure remained stable and neither @xmath43 formation , nor dissociation of oxygen atoms from graphene surface did occurred .",
    "high binding energies of adsorbed oxygen atoms and absence of oxygen dissociation or any irreversible structural transition at 1000 k suggest that the oxygen covered domains shall remain intact for reasonable times in spite of the fact that underlying graphene is locally distorted .",
    "the adsorption of oxygen atoms on one side of graphene and hence formation of domain structure induces structural deformations at the underlying graphene .",
    "[ figure_altust ] ( a ) shows the side - view of graphene structure with two oxygen atoms adsorbed on the same surface of graphene .",
    "the carbon atoms below the adsorbed oxygen atoms are distorted and raised towards oxygen atoms .",
    "the resulting buckling is as large as 0.88  above the plane of graphene .",
    "the amount of these distortions are further increased with the addition of more oxygen atoms .",
    "in contrast to this situation , the amount of buckling is reduced to 0.25  , if the second oxygen atom were adsorbed to the other surface of graphene , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_altust ] ( b ) . nonetheless , the latter configuration is 110 mev more energetic than the previous case .",
    "this result is good in agreement with ref [ ] .",
    "hence , the two - sided adsorption shall be preferred instead of the single - sided adsorption . despite that the favorable binding site of second oxygen atom at the other side follows our bond charge density analysis discussed in sec .",

    "the charges of bond charge at the bridge site for reasons discussed before result in the changes in the energies at the bridge sites .",

    "here we consider the electronic properties corresponding to different number of oxygen atoms adsorbed at different bridge sites of the ( 4x4 ) supercell repeating periodically .",

    "[ figure3 ] ( d ) is a verification of this situation for oxygen adsorption on graphene .",

    "additional oxygen atoms are adsorbed to the bridge sites above the c - c bonds of graphene , which has highest charge density .",

    "even if the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms forms domains with nonuniform coverage , full coverage can form eventually .",
    "high oxygen coverage only at one side of graphene causes to severe deformations of graphene lattice . while the adsorption configurations which can be precursors of unzipped of graphene are not favorable for low coverage of large graphene surfaces , they may occur at the edges of domains comprising large number of oxygen atoms , where underlying graphene lattice is severely distorted .",
    "nonequilibrium conditions occurring at finite temperatures and size effects originating from the small size of underlying graphene may favor the nucleation of precursors of unzipping .",
    "single oxygen migrates on a pathway of minimum energy barrier of 0.6 ev over the honeycomb structure between bridge and top sites . for the same reason the interaction between two oxygen adatoms exhibits an oscillatory variation , but becomes increasingly repulsive as the distance decreases beyond a threshold value .",
    "this repulsive interaction hinders desorption of oxygen through the formation of o@xmath5 molecule despite the negative formation energy of adsorbed oxygen atoms .",
    "the electronic structure of oxidized graphene is strongly dependent on the coverage of oxygen and its configuration .",
