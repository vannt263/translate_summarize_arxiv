    "in addition to these successful observations , 51  eri was also observed with gpi in @xmath11-band on 2015 january 29 , where 51  eri  b was not recovered due to poor image quality , and in @xmath12-band on 2015 august 30 and 31 where , although 51  eri  b was recovered , the signal - to - noise ratio was significantly worse .",
    "the gpi observations obtained on 2015 september 1 were reduced using the gpi data reduction pipeline ( drp ; @xcite ) . the dark current was subtracted and bad pixels were identified and fixed .",

    "there was a further correction factor based on the proper motion constraints from the 2003 non - detection , as only 34% of the expected distribution of field brown dwarfs had the motion required to place the object behind the star in 2003 .",
