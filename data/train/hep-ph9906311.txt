    "if light sterile neutrinos exist , then this will lead to important implications for early universe cosmology .",
    "this is because ordinary - sterile neutrino oscillations generate large neutrino asymmetries for a large range of parameters@xcite .",
    "this is a generic feature of ordinary - sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "the implications of this phenomena are quite model dependent .",
    "various implications of this phenomena have been discussed in a number of previous papers for a number of interesting models motivated by the existing neutrino anomalies@xcite .",
    "for example in refs.@xcite it has been shown that the maximal @xmath7 oscillation solution to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is consistent with a stringent bbn bound of @xmath8 ( and may also be consistent with @xmath9 depending on the model@xcite ) .",
    "this consistency requires @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 ) thus placing the @xmath12 in the interesting hot dark matter range .",
    "of course this is also of great interest to short - baseline experimentalists !    of particular concern to this paper , is the ` low temperature ' evolution of neutrino asymmetries which also has important implications for bbn . in ref.@xcite , we discussed the four neutrino model with @xmath2 . in this case a large @xmath4 asymmetry is generated by @xmath3 oscillations , some of which is transferred to @xmath0 by @xmath13 oscillations .",
    "this has important implications for bbn since it allows @xmath9 , with @xmath14 for a large range of parameters if @xmath15 .",
    "qualitatively similar results occur for other sterile neutrino models as has been shown in a number of recent papers@xcite",
    ". one point of all this is that @xmath9 is a serious possibility if light effectively sterile neutrinos exist .    in the paper ref.@xcite we considered the case of large @xmath16 where the @xmath0 was created above 1.5 - 2.0 mev , so that its implications for bbn could be approximately discussed by using thermal neutrino distributions ( i.e.",
    "the neutrino asymmetry was distributed with chemical potentials ) which were approximately constant during the era when the neutron / proton ratio was changing ( i.e. for @xmath17 ) .",
    "we also briefly estimated the effects for the direct production of @xmath0 by @xmath18 oscillations .",
    "( this case is only possible if the other neutrinos are lighter or do not oscillate into the sterile neutrino ) .",
    "recently , ref.@xcite has been criticised in ref.@xcite where it is claimed that the time dependence of the neutrino asymmetry and finite repopulation rate ( which was assumed to be instantaneous in ref.@xcite for temperatures above about 1.5 mev ) is of critical importance .",
    "ref.@xcite also similarly criticises ref.@xcite ( which studied a quite different 4 neutrino model with approximately degenerate @xmath19 states ) but this is clearly unjustified because ref.@xcite takes into account the finite repopulation rate using a pauli - boltzman approach ( as well as the time dependence of the distortion in the neutrino distributions ) . in fact , ref.@xcite appears to follow the repopulation procedure advocated in ref.@xcite and re - examines the cases in ref.@xcite using this repopulation procedure . in view of this",
    ", we have also decided to revisit the models considered in ref.@xcite in this paper because we believe that the results of ref.@xcite to be incorrect .",
    "we will compute the evolution of the number distributions taking into account the finite repopulation rate and time dependence of the asymmetry . as already emphasised above",
    ", such an approach was already used in the papers@xcite discussing different models , so it is straightforward to apply it here .",
    "we will also improve on ref.@xcite by discussing more completely the effects of the two similar oscillation modes , @xmath20 .",
    "we also give a more accurate treatment of the kinetic decoupling region which suggests a slightly lower kinetic decoupling temperature .",
    "the primordial deuterium to hydrogen ( @xmath21 ) ratio can be used to give a sensitive determination of the baryon to photon ratio @xmath22 which , given the estimated primordial @xmath23he mass fraction , can be used to infer the effective number of light neutrino flavours @xmath24 during the bbn epoch .",
    "this value can then be compared with the predictions for @xmath24 from various models of particle physics to find out which ones are compatible with standard bbn .",
    "for example , the minimal standard model predicts @xmath25 . at the present time , most estimates favour @xmath26 and some estimates favour @xmath27@xcite .",
    "of course , even if a model of particle physics is shown to be incompatible with bbn , this does not necessarily mean that the model is incorrect , since for example , it is also possible that one of the standard assumptions of bbn may not be correct@xcite .    for gauge models with effectively sterile neutrinos ,",
    "one in general expects @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , @xmath24 may be less than three or greater than three .",
    "the prediction for @xmath24 depends on the oscillation parameters in a given model and also the sign of the asymmetry ( which for various reasons can not be predicted at the moment ) .",
    "one possible consequence of ordinary - sterile neutrino oscillations is the excitation of sterile neutrino states , which typically leads to an increase in the expansion rate of the universe and thereby also increases @xmath24 .",
    "another possible consequence of ordinary - sterile neutrino oscillations is the dynamical generation of an electron - neutrino asymmetry .",
    "this also has important implications for bbn , as it directly affects the reaction rates which determine the neutron to proton ( @xmath29 ) ratio just before nucleosynthesis .",
    "if the electron neutrino asymmetry is positive then it will decrease @xmath24 , while if it is negative then it will increase @xmath24 .    the neutron to nucleon ratio , @xmath30 , is related to the primordial helium mass fraction , @xmath31 , by @xmath32 just before nucleosynthesis .",
    "the evolution of @xmath30 is governed by the equation , @xmath33 where the reaction rates are approximately @xmath34 these reaction rates depend on the momentum distributions of the species involved .",
    "the 2-body processes in eq.([eq : rates ] ) for determining @xmath35 are only important for temperatures above about @xmath36 mev .",
    "below this temperature these weak interaction rates freeze out and neutron decay becomes the dominant factor affecting the @xmath29 ratio .",
    "for example , an excess of @xmath37 over @xmath38 , due to the creation of a positive @xmath0 would change the rates for the processes in eq.([eq : rates ] ) . the effect of this would be to reduce the n / p ratio , and hence reduce @xmath31 .",
    "neutron decay is not significantly altered by lepton asymmetries unless they are very large .",
    "it is quite well known that a small change in @xmath31 due to the modification of @xmath37 and @xmath39 distributions does not impact significantly on the other light element abundances ( see for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a small modification to the expansion rate , using the convenient unit @xmath24 , primarily affects only @xmath31 , with@xcite @xmath40 since appendix a of ref.@xcite , describes in detail how we compute the effect on @xmath31 due to the modified @xmath37 and @xmath39 distributions , we will not waste any more paper by discussing it further here .",
    "in this section we will study the direct production of a large @xmath0 from @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "we will ignore oscillations involving @xmath41 or @xmath12 .",
    "this is only an approximately valid thing to do provided that either their masses are very small ( so that the largest @xmath16 belongs to the @xmath1 oscillations and the other oscillations have @xmath16 much less than @xmath42 ) _ or _ that they do not mix with the @xmath43 ( i.e. the @xmath43 decouple from the @xmath19 in the neutrino mass matrix ) .",
    "let us begin with some necessary preliminaries .",
    "our notation / convention for ordinary - sterile neutrino two state mixing is as follows .",
    "the weak and sterile eigenstates @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 are linear combinations of two mass eigenstates @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the vacuum mixing angle .",
    "we define @xmath50 so that @xmath51 and we adopt the convention that @xmath52 .",
    "recall that the @xmath53-type neutrino asymmetry is defined by @xmath54 in the above equation , @xmath55 is the number density of photons , @xmath56 .",
    "note that when we refer to `` neutrinos '' , sometimes we will mean neutrinos and/or antineutrinos .",
    "we hope the correct meaning will be clear from context .",
    "also , if neutrinos are majorana particles , then technically they are their own antiparticle .",
    "thus , when we refer to `` antineutrinos '' we obviously mean the right - handed helicity state in this case .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that ordinary - sterile neutrino oscillations generate large neutrino asymmetries for a wide range of parameters . this work built upon earlier work on ordinary - sterile neutrino oscillations in the early universe@xcite . as already discussed in detail in previous publications @xcite the evolution of lepton number",
    "can be separated into three distinct phases . at high temperatures",
    "the oscillations are damped and evolve so that @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 , and @xmath22 is related to the baryon asymmetry ) . in this region",
    "the resonance momentum for neutrino oscillations is approximately the same as anti - neutrino oscillations . if @xmath59 then at a certain temperature , @xmath60 , which is given roughly by@xcite , @xmath61 exponential growth of neutrino asymmetry occurs ( which typically generates a neutrino asymmetry of order @xmath62 at @xmath63 , see figure 1 of ref.@xcite for some typical examples ) .",
    "taking for definiteness that the @xmath64 is positive , the anti - neutrino oscillation resonance moves to very low values of @xmath65 while the neutrino oscillation resonance moves to high values @xmath66 ( see ref.@xcite for a figure illustrating this ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of neutrino asymmetries , which is dominated by adiabatic msw transitions of the antineutrinos , follows an orderly @xmath67 behaviour until the resonance has passed through the entire distribution .",
    "the final asymmetry generated is typically in the range @xmath68@xcite . because the oscillations are dominated by adiabatic msw behaviour it is possible to use a relatively simple and accurate formalism to describe the evolution of the system at the ` low temperatures ' , @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , we only need to know the values of the oscillation resonance momentum at @xmath70 .",
    "previous numerical work has already shown@xcite that by @xmath70 , neutrino asymmetry is generated such that @xmath71 ( the precise value depends on @xmath72 ) .",
    "furthermore the subsequent evolution is approximately insensitive to the initial value of @xmath73 in this range ( provided , of course , that negligible number of sterile neutrinos were produced at high temperature ) .    in this section",
    "we will deal with the case of @xmath1 oscillations directly producing the @xmath0 asymmetry . for the implications for bbn we are primarily interested in the `` low temperature '' evolution of the number distributions and lepton numbers in this case .",
    "our analysis can be broken up into the following steps :    1 .",
    "we assume complete adiabatic msw conversion of neutrinos at the msw resonance .",
    "2 .   from this",
    "we can compute the evolution of lepton number asymmetries which not only dictates the momentum of the msw resonances , but also the chemical potentials .",
    "3 .   using these chemical potentials",
    "we can evaluate the equilibrium distributions from which we can estimate the actual distributions by a pauli - boltzman repopulation equation .",
    "we now discuss each of these steps in detail .",
    "consider , for the moment , two - flavour small angle ( i.e. @xmath74 ) ordinary - sterile @xmath1 neutrino oscillations . as",
    "discussed in detail in earlier papers the @xmath1 neutrino oscillations only generate @xmath0 provided that @xmath75 and this will be assumed in the forthcoming discussion ( where @xmath76 is the mass of the state which is predominately @xmath37 ) .",
    "recall that there is an experimental upper bound on @xmath76 which is a few ev if @xmath37 is a dirac neutrino and about an ev if @xmath37 is a majorana neutrino@xcite . ] .",
    "we know from numerical integration of the exact quantum kinetic equations@xcite that the adiabatic approximation is valid provided that @xmath77 .",
    "now , coherent small angle adiabatic msw transitions completely convert @xmath78 at the resonance momentum of these states . the resonance momentum is given approximately by ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the above equation we have neglected the @xmath82 asymmetry ( as well as the baryon / electron asymmetry ) .",
    "this is because these asymmetries are unimportant in the low temperature region unless they happen to be large ( i.e. greater than about @xmath62 ) . for adiabatic two - flavour neutrino oscillations in the early universe",
    "it is quite easy to see that the rate of change of lepton number is governed by the simple equation@xcite , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the msw resonance momentum , eq.([7 ] ) and @xmath85 .",
    "\\label{he6}\\ ] ] also , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the momentum distributions of the @xmath39 and @xmath88 states . in the above equations , the case",
    "@xmath15 has been considered ( so that the resonance occurs for antineutrinos ) .",
    "equation ( [ he ] ) relates the rate of change of lepton number to the speed of the resonance momentum through the neutrino distribution .",
    "reference @xcite provides a detailed discussion of how this equation can be derived from the quantum kinetic equations for the case of adiabatic evolution with a narrow resonance width . as discussed in ref.@xcite , equation ( [ he ] )",
    "can be simplified using @xmath89 from which it follows that @xmath90 where @xmath91 for @xmath92 ( that is for @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 for @xmath95 and we have dropped the momentum dependence of @xmath96 in the above equation for notational clarity and it does not change sign during subsequent evolution . ] .",
    "eq.([presevol ] ) allows us to compute the evolution of @xmath0 .",
    "as discussed earlier , it is valid from @xmath70 ( with @xmath97 at this point ) . for the more complicated multi - flavour case considered in section iv , coupled equations based on eq.([presevol ] ) will be used .",
    "we now must describe how we compute the evolution of @xmath98 .",
    "the msw transitions effect the adiabatic conversion latexmath:[\\[|\\overline \\nu_e \\rangle \\leftrightarrow     through the @xmath39 momentum distribution , @xmath100 in our numerical work the continuous momentum distribution for each flavour is replaced by a finite number of ` cells ' on a logarithmically spaced mesh .",
    "as the momentum @xmath101 passes a cell , the number density in the cell is modified according to eq.([p1 ] ) .",
    "of course weak interactions will repopulate some of these cells as they thermalise the neutrino momentum distributions .",
    "the repopulation can also generate small chemical potentials for the other flavours ( as will be discussed latter ) .",

    "previous papers@xcite used a simple approximation whereby the transition out of chemical equilibrium occurred at the decoupling temperature @xmath109 .",
    "obviously this is not a sharp transition .",
    "also , there will be small chemical potentials created by the other flavours as they create @xmath110 pairs to compensate for the loss of @xmath39 states . in the appendix",
    "we discuss a more accurate ( but more complicated ) formalism to compute the values of the chemical potentials for all of the flavours as a function of time ( or equivalently temperature ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the simple treatment of chemical decoupling , discussed in previous papers is roughly valid , but noticable differences ( though typically not greater than about @xmath111 ) for bbn can occur .",
    "[ although there will not be much difference for the @xmath1 case since the lepton number is generated so late , since experimentally @xmath112 ( see footnote 2 ) ] .",
    "we will use the more complicated formalism discussed in the appendix to evaluate the chemical potentials for all of our numerical work in this paper .    using the above procedure the lepton asymmetry @xmath0 , and the neutrino distributions",
    ", @xmath113 can be obtained .",
    "we can feed the @xmath114 distributions into a nucleosynthesis code ( which we integrate concurrently ) in order to compute the implications for bbn .",
    "it is useful to separate the total contribution to @xmath115 into two contributions , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the change due to the effect of the modified electron neutrino momentum distributions on the nuclear reaction rates , and @xmath118 is due to the change in the energy density ( or equivalently the change in the expansion rate of the universe ) .",
    "while bbn is only sensitive ( to a good approximation ) to the total contribution , @xmath115 , the separate parts will have quite different implications for the forthcoming precision measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "in particular it may be possible to estimate the expansion rate of the universe at the time of photon decoupling@xcite .",
    "the contribution @xmath117 can be determined by numerically integrating the rate equations for the processes given in eq.([eq : rates ] ) using the modified electron neutrino momentum distributions @xmath119 and @xmath120 as discussed in appendix a of ref.@xcite .",

    "a temperature of @xmath128 is therefore a safe place to evaluate the final @xmath118 .",
    "recall that there is an ambiguity concerning the sign of the @xmath0 lepton asymmetry .",
    "we have considered the @xmath129 case above for definiteness , but @xmath130 is equally likely a priori .",
    "previous work ref.@xcite has shown that the sign is fixed in the region where the static approximation is valid .",
    "this approximation assumes that the the asymmetry evolution is dominated by collisions and is sufficiently smooth .",
    "importantly it is generally valid in the region @xmath131 where the neutrino asymmetry is initially generated@xcite provided that @xmath132 @xcite for @xmath133 .",
    "thus in this region of parameters the sign is fixed .",
    "for @xmath134 numerical integration of the quantum kinetic equations ( including the momentum distribution of the neutrinos ) reveals@xcite that the sign oscillates for @xmath133 .",
    "qualitatively , this is very easy to understand .",
    "this reason is that in the average momentum toy - model , all of the neutrinos enter the msw resonance at the same time which significantly enhances the rate at which neutrino asymmetry is created at @xmath135 .",
    "the rapid creation of neutrino asymmetry reduces the region where the oscillations are adiabatic@xcite .",
    "also , the paper in ref.@xcite similarly assumes that all of the neutrinos have the same momentum , but ( perhaps not suprisingly ) obtain quite different results to ref.@xcite . ] for a short period at @xmath131 . in the parameter region where the sign oscillates ( and possibly in some of the parameter region where it does nt oscillate ) the sign",
    "may not be fixed when fluctuations are considered@xcite .",
    "it may be possible for different regions of space to have different signs of the lepton number , as first suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "whether this happens or not is an open question at the moment and will depend on the size of the fluctuations present .    in any case , even if the sign is fixed , it can not be predicted as it depends on the initial values of the neutrino asymmetries ( as well as the baryon asymmetry ) .",
    "for the negative @xmath136 case , the roles of particles and anti - particles are reversed .",
    "one consequence of this is that the signs of all the other asymmetries are also reversed .",
    "the quantity @xmath117 will obviously be significantly affected by this ambiguity in sign , while @xmath118 will not be affected at all .",
    "this means that we have two possible values for the overall change in the effective number of neutrino flavours during bbn .",
    "the results of the numerical work is presented in figs.1 - 3 . in figure 1",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath0 for three examples , @xmath137 .",
    "we emphasise that the evolution is approximately independent of @xmath138 so long as @xmath138 satisfies @xmath139 where the lower bound comes from adiabaticity while the upper bound comes from the requirement that @xmath1 oscillations do not populate the sterile states at high temperatures before the neutrino asymmetry is initially generated , i.e. for @xmath140 ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) . as explained earlier , we start the low temperature evolution at @xmath141 with the value of @xmath97 .",
    "of course the full evolution from @xmath142 to @xmath143 can be obtained from numerical integration of the quantum kinetic equations ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , for the applications considered in this paper only the low temperature evolution is required , which is why we use the much simpler formalism based on eq.([presevol ] ) .",
    "the implications for bbn are shown in figure 2,3 .",
    "figure 2 treats the @xmath15 case , while fig.3 displays the @xmath130 case . as these figures show , the effect of the @xmath1 oscillations on bbn is very significant and depends sensitively on the sign of the asymmetry and on the @xmath144 value .",
    "we emphasise that our equations contain approximations .",
    "the most important are that the repopulation is handled approximately via eq.([dfd ] ) .",
    "it is obviously difficult to estimate the size of this uncertaintly without computing repopulation exactly .",
    "nevertheless we expect that this theoretical uncertainty is typically less than @xmath145 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath118 is close to zero for the range of @xmath144 considered .",
    "this can be approximately understood by noting that the generation of sterile states occurs below the kinetic decoupling temperature for @xmath37 s .",
    "this means that the @xmath37 states which have converted into sterile states are not significantly repopulated .",
    "it is interesting to observe that @xmath118 is computed to be slightly negative for values of @xmath146 .",
    "this feature can be qualitatively explained as follows . as @xmath73 moves through the initial part of the spectrum",
    "the msw transitions deplete the @xmath39 s before the @xmath39 spectrum is significantly distorted by the @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "however , by the time @xmath73 moves to the higher momentum part ( i.e. @xmath147 ) , the neutrino asymmetry is so large that the number of @xmath39 states are significantly reduced ( c.f . with the fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential ) .",
    "for this reason the oscillations deplete more low momentum neutrinos than high momentum ones .",
    "the concurrent thermalisation of the neutrino distribution evidently reduces the average @xmath73 per neutrino , and hence the energy density _ divided by @xmath148 _ can be slightly reduced .",
    "of course the temperature of the @xmath39 states would be expected to increase a little , which in our approximation is neglected ( much of this temperature increase would be absorbed by the other flavours which are still in approximate thermal equilibrium down to temperatures 1 - 2 mev ) .    note that in the case of very small @xmath149 , the dominant effect of the neutrino asymmetry in the @xmath15 case is the modification to the pauli blocking of the neutron decay .",
    "ordinarily neutrino asymmetries lead to a negligible effect for neutron decay however in this case the effect is small ( but not completely negligible ) because the neutrino asymmetry is so large ( @xmath150 for @xmath151 ) .    finally note that our results are quite different to the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "we do not know why this is the case .",
    "unfortunately , ref.@xcite gives few details of how they computed the evolution of the neutrino asymmetry .",
    "thus it is difficult to know whether the difference lies in the details of the asymmetry evolution or in the bbn code .",
    "this concludes our study of the direct production of @xmath0 from @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "we now consider the alternative , but more complicated case of the indirect production of @xmath0 from a large @xmath4 asymmetry .",
    "we now discuss the second scenario of ref.@xcite , that is a four neutrino model with @xmath153 we will first deviate from ref.@xcite by considering the simpler case where the muon neutrino is ignored .",
    "strictly , this would only be possible if the mixing angle satisfies @xmath154 .",
    "this case is simpler because there are then only two important oscillation modes , @xmath155 and @xmath13 .",
    "moreover these two oscillation modes always have quite different resonance momentum , so that they can each be described by two flavour oscillations . later",
    "( in part b ) we will consider the alternative case where @xmath156 and @xmath157 oscillations are also important .",
    "if we ignore the muon neutrino then there are two oscillation modes with approximately the same @xmath16 , which we denote as @xmath158 : @xmath159 note that @xmath160 given eq.([ppq ] ) .",
    "we will consider the parameter space region where the @xmath161 values of all the other oscillation modes are small enough so that they can be approximately neglected for temperatures @xmath162 .",
    "( this will be true if the @xmath6 of these other oscillation modes are all much less than about @xmath163 ) .",
    "this last condition means that these modes will not significantly affect the neutron / proton ratio and hence can not significantly affect bbn .    in the following discussion",
    "we consider the case @xmath164 for definiteness .",
    "this means that the @xmath165 generate @xmath4 while @xmath166 oscillations reprocess some of this asymmetry into @xmath0 .",
    "note that in this scenario the sign of @xmath0 is necessarily the same as the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution of this system can be described by a straightforward generalisation of the two - flavour case given in eq.([presevol ] ) . in this case",
    "there are two msw resonances , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",

    "of course we have implicitly assumed that the @xmath193 oscillation modes do not significantly populate the sterile neutrinos before bbn .",
    "this is a valid assumption for a large range of parmaters even if the @xmath46 mixes with large mixing angles with @xmath194 and/or @xmath37 .",
    "for example , if @xmath195 oscillations are approximately maximal with @xmath196 ( as suggested by the atmospheric neutrino anomaly ) then the @xmath197 oscillations can potentially populate the sterile neutrinos at the high temperature @xmath198 .",
    "however this does nt happen if the @xmath12 is in the ev mass range ( for a large range of @xmath199)@xcite .",
    "in figure 4 we plot the evolution of the neutrino asymmetries , @xmath200 , for three examples , @xmath201 .",
    "as these figures show , for low values of @xmath202 the transfer of @xmath0 from @xmath4 is not very efficient .",
    "this is expected because the transfer of asymmetry relies on repopulation to distribute the @xmath4 away from the momentum region where it is created ( i.e. @xmath203 ) to the momentum region where @xmath204 oscillations are important ( i.e. at @xmath205 ) . as @xmath158 increases the temperature where the @xmath4 asymmetry is created increases which makes the transfer to @xmath0 more efficient because of the faster repopulation rate .",
    "the implications for bbn are shown in figures 5,6 .",
    "figure 5 treats the @xmath15 case , while fig.6 displays the @xmath130 case . as before ,",
    "our results have a theoretical uncertainty which is dominated by the approximate treatment of repopulation .",
    "this uncertainty is expected to be typically less than about @xmath145 ( obviously we expect this uncertainty to be much smaller than this when @xmath206 is small ) . in the @xmath164 case",
    "there is a dip at around @xmath207 .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood as follows . for @xmath208",
    "the repopulation rate is not so rapid .",
    "this has two obvious effects : first , the thermalisation of the @xmath12 momentum distribution is not so rapid and this would lead to less efficient production of @xmath0 .",
    "this effect would lead to a decrease in @xmath0 ( and hence decrease @xmath209 ) .",
    "second , the effect of a slow repopulation rate on the @xmath37 distribution would be expected to have the opposite effect .",
    "the reason is that the momentum at which @xmath0 creation is most significant is in the high momentum tail .",
    "this is because @xmath210 and significant @xmath0 is not generated until @xmath4 is sufficiently large , i.e. roughly @xmath211 .",
    "the distortion of the @xmath37 distribution in the high momentum tail greatly enhances the effects for bbn because these effects depend quadratically on the neutrino momentum .",
    "evidently our numerical work indicates that the second effect dominates over the first effect .",
    "finally , we now consider the more interesting , but more complicated case with the muon neutrino included .",
    "when the muon neutrino is included ( i.e. @xmath212 ) there are three oscillation modes with approximately the same @xmath16 , which we again denote as @xmath158 : @xmath213 all the other oscillation modes have much smaller @xmath16 values . as before , we will consider the parameter space region where the @xmath161 values of all the other oscillation modes are small enough so that they can be approximately neglected for temperatures @xmath162 .",
    "this last condition means that these modes will not affect the neutron / proton ratio and hence can not significantly affect bbn .    in the following discussion",
    "we again consider the case @xmath164 for definiteness .",
    "this means that the @xmath165 generate @xmath4 while the other two oscillation modes reprocess some of this asymmetry into @xmath214 . in ref.@xcite",
    "this system was first considered in this context .",
    "there , it was assumed that @xmath215 . while this is a good approximation for large enough values of @xmath16 , it is not always valid ( as we will show below ) . in the following",
    "we will not assume this and consider the effect of the three oscillations modes .",
    "at this point one may legitimately worry about 3-flavour effects .",
    "this is because the resonance momentum of the @xmath13 and @xmath216 oscillation modes are expected to be approximately equal .",
    "however it turns out that these oscillations tend to be dynamically driven apart as we will explain latter on .",
    "thus , it turns out that it is actually reasonable to treat all three oscillation modes independently as 2-flavour msw transitions . in the earlier paper@xcite",
    "this issue was not fully discussed so our treatment here improves on ref.@xcite .    in this system",
    "there are three msw resonances , @xmath167 , @xmath217 and @xmath168 .",
    "we denote the resonance momentum of these three oscillations by @xmath218 and @xmath219 respectively .",

    "the high temperature evolution typically does not generate significant @xmath214 ( i.e. typically @xmath227 ) . so that we have @xmath228 .",
    "now , there is no reason why @xmath229 should exactly coincide with @xmath230 ( although it will be approximately equal ) .",
    "in fact for these two oscillations , @xmath231 is not dynamically stable as we shall now explain .",
    "the behaviour of oscillations such as these ( in the context of a quite different model ) has been studied in some detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "generically there are two possible outcomes .",
    "either the evolution of lepton number is such that it drives @xmath232 _ or _ the evolution of lepton numbers is such as to drive them apart . to figure out what s going to happen",
    "imagine that @xmath229 is slightly less than @xmath230 .",
    "in other words the @xmath233 oscillation resonance preceeds the @xmath217 oscillation resonance .",
    "this means that the @xmath234 resonance will efficiently interchange @xmath235 and @xmath39 states at the resonance .",
    "this will transfer some @xmath4 to @xmath0 and will thus speed up the resonance a bit since it is inversely proportional to the difference of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the trailing @xmath236 resonance will be less effective in transferring @xmath4 to @xmath82 because at this resonance there will be approximately equal number of @xmath237 and @xmath238 states thanks to the efforts of the @xmath233 resonance .",
    "thus the two resonances will slowly move apart until eventually they will be far enough apart so that the thermalisation due to the collisions will be rapid enough to thermalise the @xmath12 spectrum such that the @xmath82 is created at approximately the same rate as the @xmath0 .",
    "for definiteness , we will assume as our initial condition that @xmath239 .",
    "for our numerical work we will assume that @xmath240 initially .",
    "this could be due to a slightly larger @xmath241 .",
    "it is straightforward to numerically integrate the evolution equations , eq.([5aa ] ) , with @xmath183 ` initial conditions ' as described above .",

    ", the modification to @xmath24 would be somewhat smaller , especially for lower values of @xmath158 .",
    "let us compare our results with the original work in ref.@xcite and the more recent work of ref.@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we made the approximation that the repopulation was instantaneous above about 1.5 mev .",

    "we found that @xmath244 for @xmath15 and @xmath245 for @xmath130 for @xmath246 for the @xmath15 case the results are in rough agreement for @xmath247 .",
    "the difference for larger @xmath158 is due to the more accurate treatment of chemical decoupling which suggests a lower decoupling temperature .",
    "for the @xmath130 case the effect is underestimated by about @xmath36 in @xmath248 in ref.@xcite .",
    "this difference is partly due to a mistake in the numerical work of ref.@xcite which we have recently discovered .",

    "we do not know the reason for this .",
    "we have made a detailed study of several ` four neutrino scenarios ' which can generate significant @xmath0 asymmetry thereby affecting bbn ( these scenarios were first discussed in this context in ref.@xcite ) . in the first case we considered the direct production of @xmath0 from @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "our results are shown in figure 2,3 .",
    "clearly very large modifications to bbn are possible and depend sensitively on @xmath6 [ but are approximately independent of @xmath249 so long as @xmath249 is in the range , eq.([rau ] ) ] . the results also depends critically on the sign of @xmath0",
    ". we also studied the indirect production of @xmath0 from @xmath4 .",

    "these results are in rough agreement with our earlier conclusion@xcite that @xmath250 for the case of positive @xmath0 for the parameter range eq.([ik8 ] ) .",
    "notice that the figures show a slightly larger effect for @xmath251 where the slow repopulation rate becomes important ( ref.@xcite assumed that repopulation was instantaneous ) .",
    "also the more accurate treatment of repopulation in the kinetic decoupling region suggests a larger @xmath248 for @xmath252 than was found previously .",
    "we conclude by emphasising once more that the detailed predictions of models with light sterile neutrinos are quite model dependent .",
    "quantitatively different results occur for four neutrino models with approximately degenerate @xmath253@xcite , as well as in six neutrino models with three light sterile neutrinos approximately maximally mixed with each of the ordinary neutrinos@xcite .",
    "it is a remarkable prospect that accurate determinations of the primordial element abundances , as well as forthcoming precision measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background may one day help to distinguish between competing models of particle physics .",
