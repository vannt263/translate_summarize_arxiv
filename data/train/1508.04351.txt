    "most models in mathematical finance are bound to the paradigm that discounted asset prices are true martingales under the risk neutral measure .",
    "however , no - arbitrage theory as developed by delbaen and schachermayer  @xcite actually allows for the more general case of discounted asset prices being local martingales ( or even sigma martingales ) while still remaining consistent with absence of arbitrage in the sense of no free lunch with vanishing risk .",
    "processes which fall in the latter category , but not in the former , i.e. , which are local martingales but not true martingales are usually called strict local martingales . although not trivial to construct , the appearance of strict local martingales in certain local and stochastic volatility models has been noted e.g. in  @xcite . in contrast to true martingale models , where the current asset price equals the risk - neutral expectation of the future discounted asset price ( ` fundamental price ' ) , these two values differ from each other in strict local martingale models . for this very reason ,",
    "strict local martingale models have been interpreted as models for markets with price bubbles , see e.g.  @xcite or the review paper  @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "for one - dimensional it diffusions without drift , a precise characterisation of strict local martingales was obtained in  @xcite ; this was recently used in a series of papers by jarrow , kchia and protter  @xcite to propose a statistical test based on realised volatility to determine whether a given underlying ( linkedin s stock and gold ) exhibits a price bubble . in the context of option pricing , it has been shown that the strict local martingale property leads to unexpected and counter - intuitive behaviour .",
    "in particular put - call - parity fails , classical no - static - arbitrage bounds are no longer valid and there is some ambiguity about the proper valuation of derivatives with unbounded payoffs , such as calls .",
    "we refer to  @xcite and a more elaborate discussion in section  [ sub : option ] .",
    "in this paper we focus on the properties of implied volatilities and of the resulting implied volatility surface in asset pricing models with the strict local martingale property . with the exception of  @xcite , who discusses long - time behaviour of implied volatilities ,",
    "this is to our knowledge the first paper to discuss implied volatilities without imposing the true martingale assumption on the underlying . due to the failure of put - call - parity and no - static - arbitrage bounds",
    ", it turns out that put- and call - implied volatility has to be distinguished and that call - implied volatility does not always exist , see theorem  [ thm : existenceiv ] .",
    "following an idea of cox and hobson  @xcite , we introduce the ` fully collateralised call ' , which restores put - call - parity and leads again to equality of put - implied and call - implied volatilities .",
    "nevertheless , our main result , theorem  [ thm : ivexpansion ] shows that the right wing of the implied volatility smile in strict local martingale models exhibits an asymptotic behaviour which is fundamentally different from true martingale models .",
    "this also shows that in principle , strict local martingale models can be distinguished from true martingale models by analysing the implied volatility surface .",
    "moreover , this result complements the well - known results of lee  @xcite and benaim and friz  @xcite on the behaviour of the wings of the implied volatility smile in true ( non - negative ) martingale models .",
    "certain refinements of this main result are then obtained in corollary  [ cor : dual ] , by applying a duality method based on an absolutely continuous measure change .",
    "this method is well - known in the context of strict local martingales ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and puts positive strict local martingale models in duality with true martingale models with ( positive ) probability mass at zero .",
    "recently , de marco , jacquier and hillairet  @xcite and gulisashvili  @xcite showed that , for a true martingale with mass at zero , the left tail of the smile was fully determined ( up to second order ) by the probability weight of this very mass . applying the duality method , the results on right - wing asymptotics of strict local martingales in this paper can be seen as a direct analogue of the left - wing asymptotics of true martingales with mass at zero .",

    "the other boundary case @xmath16 takes place if and only @xmath17 , @xmath2 almost surely .",
    "we exclude this degenerate case from our analysis and work under the assumption that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 $ ] .",

    "recall that the market model @xmath22 does not allow for arbitrage opportunities in the sense of no free lunch with vanishing risk ( nflvr ) .",
    "indeed , the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that the nflvr condition holds if and only if there exists an equivalent probability measure under which the ( discounted ) semimartingale stock price is a sigma martingale . as all local martingales are sigma martingales , the strict local martingale property of  @xmath4 under @xmath2 implies nflvr .",

    ", see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite for a detailed discussion",
    ". we will summarise the phenomena which are relevant in the context of implied volatility .",
    "first let us define call and put prices on the underlying @xmath4 ( and for fixed maturity @xmath37 ) by their risk - neutral expectations @xmath38 where in view of our analysis of implied volatility we parametrise by log - strike @xmath39 . in complete markets",
    "these prices are indeed the unique minimal super - replication prices of their payoffs ( see  @xcite ) , but  as will be seen below  other sensible prices for puts and calls which are consistent with absence of arbitrage exist .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath40 holds for all real number  @xmath41 , and hence put - call parity fails whenever @xmath14 , i.e. , exactly when @xmath4 is a strict local martingale  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.4 ) .",
    "a further pathology emerges when we consider price bounds . a direct application of jensen s inequality yields the inequalities @xmath42 for the call and the put , valid for all @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath13 the process @xmath4 is a true martingale and these bounds become the classic no - static - arbitrage bounds for calls and puts . in the strict local martingale case , @xmath14 , the lower bound for",
    "the call falls outside the no - static - arbitrage region .",
    "the lower bound for the put on the other hand increases with @xmath15 and thus always remains within the no - static - arbitrage region .",
    "note that for any @xmath44 , both lower bounds can be attained , which follows from example  [ ex : bridge ] where a strict local martingale with the property that @xmath45 , almost surely is given . as a consequence of theorem  [ thm : existenceiv ] below",
    ", it also follows that for each given strict local martingale @xmath4 with defect @xmath15 , there exists @xmath46 $ ] such that the corresponding call price @xmath47 violates the no static - arbitrage lower bound @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "these pathologies appear to contradict the fact that strict local martingale models are consistent with absence of arbitrage ( in the nflvr sense ) .",
    "consider for example a call option that is valued at the lower bound in  , that is @xmath50 . then , choosing a log - strike @xmath41 such that @xmath51 , it is possible to form a costless portfolio consisting of a long position in the call @xmath47 , a short position of one unit of the stock and @xmath52 in the bank account .",
    "the payoff at maturity of this portfolio is @xmath53 , and we have apparently constructed an arbitrage .",
    "the resolution of this paradox is that due to the short position in @xmath4 the value process of the portfolio is unbounded from below and therefore not an admissible strategy in the sense of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2.7 ) .",
    "indeed , if the portfolio value were bounded from below then @xmath4 would be bounded from above and hence a true martingale , in contradiction to the strict martingale property of @xmath4 .",
    "these considerations regarding admissibility of strategies are not entirely academic .",
    "short positions usually require deposit of collateral , which restricts the scope of implementable hedging strategies .",
    "for this reason it has been remarked by several authors  @xcite that defining the call - price by the risk - neutral expectation of its payoff is not the only economically sensible choice .",
    "we follow here the definition in  @xcite , where the authors consider a short position in calls and argue that such positions are usually subject to collateral requirements .",
    "thus , the value process @xmath54 of a hedging portfolio must not only replicate the call payoff at maturity @xmath37 , but also satisfy the collateral requirement @xmath55 at intermediate times . here , the function @xmath56 is used to describe the amount of collateral needed in relation to the stock price .",
    "the following is proved in  @xcite :    [ thm : collateral ] let  @xmath56 be a positive convex function satisfying @xmath57 , and  @xmath58 an arbitrary payoff satisfying @xmath59 , then the fair price ( at inception ) of a european option with payoff  @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 .    by ` fair price ' , cox and hobson mean the smallest initial fortune required to construct a self - financing wealth process super - replicating both the payoff at maturity and the collateral requirement along the life of the contract . in the case of a european call option",

    "note that only values @xmath67 $ ] make sense due to the requirement on @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that the collateral requirement does not affect the call price in a true martingale model where @xmath13 . in a strict local martingale model prices of collateralised calls",

    "strict local martingale models have been advocated as models for stock price bubbles . in this regard ,",
    "it is of interest to be able to test empirical data for the appearance of such bubbles . in the context of continuous markov diffusions ,",
    "such tests have been proposed and implemented by  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a similar idea ) based on statistical estimation of historical volatility . once the diffusion coefficient of the stock price is estimated and extrapolated to the whole real half - line , the integral criterion discussed in example  [ ex : diffusion ] is used by  @xcite to decide whether the underlying is a strict local martingale or not .",
    "complementary to the statistical approach of  @xcite , our results suggest different ways to test for the appearance of a stock price bubble based on implied ( as opposed to historical ) volatility .",
    "first , observe that in the case of non - fully - collateralised calls ( @xmath232 ) there are simple criteria to distinguish between true and strictly local martingales , based on implied volatility . from the results presented above",
    ", it follows that unless calls are fully collateralised there is equivalence of the following statements :    * the stock price process  @xmath4 is a strict local martingale under the pricing measure  @xmath2 ; * put - and call - implied volatilities are different ; * the call - implied volatility does not exist for sufficiently small strikes",
    ".    however , for fully collateralised calls ( @xmath183 ) these criteria fail . instead",

    "note that the last criterion is necessary and sufficient .",
    "the necessary part comes from theorem  [ thm : ivexpansion ] , and it is sufficient by corollary  [ cor : iv ] applied to the case @xmath235 .",

    "the drawback of this criterion is that it is an _",
    "test , valid only for large @xmath41 .",
    "this drawback is shared with the statistical test of  @xcite which also requires asymptotic extrapolation of the estimated diffusion coefficient .",
    "this property limits the value of the test in practical applications , since implied volatility ( or call prices ) can only be observed at a finite number of strikes .",
    "however , a simple argument shows that any test to determine the strict local martingale property from put - implied ( or fully collateralised call - implied ) volatilities is necessarily an asymptotic test in the sense that it uses arbitrarily large strike values as input : let @xmath4 be a non - negative local @xmath2-martingale with localising sequence @xmath237 , so that the stopped processes @xmath238 are true @xmath2-martingales .",

    "since put - implied volatilities depend continuously on the put price this shows that for any non - negative strict local martingale @xmath4 , time - strike rectangle @xmath244 and @xmath245 we can find a true martingale model @xmath246 , such that put - implied volatilities ( as well as those implied by fully collateralised calls ) are @xmath247-close , uniformly on @xmath244 .      we consider the consequences of the duality relation studied in section  [ sub : duality ] on implied volatilities .",
