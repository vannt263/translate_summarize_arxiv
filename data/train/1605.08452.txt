    "the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( bec)@xcite , achieved by taking dilute alkali gases to ultra low temperatures @xcite is certainly among the most exciting recent experimental achievements in physics .",
    "since then , investigations dedicated to the comprehension of new phenomena associated to this state of matter as well as its properties have flourished , either in the experimental or theoretical domains .",
    "the fast increasing of the control and production of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in different geometries has permitted the study of these systems in different physical situations .",
    "the fragmentation of a bec to produce a josephson junction @xcite using becs opened the possibility to study the quantum tunnelling of the atoms across a barrier between the condensates @xcite .",
    "using superposition of light in different direction is possible to create any arbitrary trapping configuration as for example a ring or a superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) with an atom bec @xcite .",
    "another experimental realization of fragmentation of becs is the two - legs bosonic ladder to study chiral current and meissner effect @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility to produce optical lattices in one - dimension ( 1d ) , two - dimensions ( 2d ) and three - dimensions ( 3d ) using one , two or three orthogonal standing waves @xcite .",
    "these experimental realisations have opened the possibility to introduce new models that permit the study of the tunnelling of the atoms between the becs .",
    "some of these models are exactly solvable by the algebraic bethe ansatz method @xcite and this open the possibility to take in account quantum fluctuations that allows us go beyond the results obtained by mean field approximations",
    ". this fruitful approach can furnish some new insights in this area , and contribute as well to the increasingly interesting field of integrable systems itself @xcite .",
    "the algebraic formulation of the bethe ansatz , and the associated quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) , was primarily developed in @xcite .",
    "the qism has been used to unveil properties of a considerable number of solvable systems , such as , one - dimensional spin chains , quantum field theory of one - dimensional interacting bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite , two - dimensional lattice models @xcite , systems of strongly correlated electrons @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite , integrable systems in high energy physics @xcite and quantum algebras ( deformations of universal enveloping algebras of lie algebras ) @xcite . for",
    "a pedagogical and historical review see @xcite .",
    "more recently solvable models have also showed up in relation to string theories ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably it is important to mention that exactly solvable models are recently finding their way into the lab , mainly in the context of ultracold atoms @xcite but also in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments@xcite turning its study as well as the derivation of new models an even more fascinating field .",
    "i am considering here the bosonic multi - states lax operator introduced by the author in @xcite that permits to solve a family of models of fragmented becs coupled by josephson tunnelling .",
    "this lax operator is a generalization of the bosonic lax operator in @xcite , where a lax operator is defined for a single canonical boson operator , but instead of a single operator we choose a linear combination of independent canonical boson operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", i will review briefly the algebraic bethe ansatz method and present the lax operators and the transfer matrix for both models . in section 3 , i present a generalized model with a family of models of fragmented becs coupled by josephson tunnelling and show their solutions . in section 4",
    ", i summarize the results .",
    "in this section we will shortly review the algebraic bethe ansatz method and present the transfer matrix used to get the solution of the models @xcite .",
    "we begin with the @xmath0-invariant @xmath1-matrix , depending on the spectral parameter @xmath2 ,    @xmath3    with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . above",
    ", @xmath7 is an arbitrary parameter , to be chosen later .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath8 satisfies the yang - baxter equation    @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes the matrix acting non - trivially on the @xmath11-th and the @xmath12-th spaces and as the identity on the remaining space .",
    "next we define the monodromy matrix @xmath13 ,    @xmath14    such that the yang - baxter algebra is satisfied    @xmath15    in what follows we will choose a realization for the monodromy matrix @xmath16 to obtain solutions of a family of models for multilevel two - well bose - einstein condensates . in this construction , the lax operators @xmath17 have to satisfy the relation    @xmath18    then , defining the transfer matrix , as usual , through    @xmath19    it follows from ( [ rtt ] ) that the transfer matrix commutes for different values of the spectral parameter ; i. e. ,    @xmath20=0 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\forall \\;u,\\;v.\\ ] ]    consequently , the models derived from this transfer matrix will be integrable .",
    "another consequence is that the coefficients @xmath21 in the transfer matrix @xmath22 ,    @xmath23    are conserved quantities or simply @xmath24-numbers , with    @xmath25 = 0 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\",
    "; \\forall \\;j,\\;k.\\ ] ]    if the transfer matrix @xmath22 is a polynomial function in @xmath2 , with @xmath26 , it is easy to see that ,    @xmath27    for the standard bosonic operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations    @xmath28 = [ \\hat{p}_{i},\\hat{q}_{j } ] = 0 , \\qquad [ \\hat{p}_{i},\\hat{q}_{j}^{\\dagger } ] = \\delta_{pq}\\delta_{ij}\\hat{i},\\ ] ]    @xmath29= + \\hat{p}_{j}^{\\dagger}\\delta_{pq}\\delta_{ij } , \\qquad [ \\hat{n}_{pi},\\hat{q}_{j}]= -\\hat{p}_{j}\\delta_{pq}\\delta_{ij},\\ ] ]    with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we have the following lax operators ,    @xmath33    and @xmath34    if the conditions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are satisfied .",
    "the above lax operators satisfy the equation ( [ rll ] ) .",
    "in this section i present some applications of the lax operators ( [ l2 ] ) and ( [ l3 ] ) for models with different number of becs @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the generalized hamiltonian is ,    @xmath39    the parameters , @xmath40 , describe the atom - atom @xmath41-wave scattering between the atoms in the respective becs , the @xmath42 parameters are the relative external potentials between the becs and @xmath43 are the energies in the becs .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 are the tunnelling amplitudes .",
    "the operators @xmath45 are the number of atoms operators .",
    "the labels @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for the becs @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we just remark that @xmath50 .",
    "the becs are coupled by josephson tunnelling and the total number of atoms , @xmath51 , is a conserved quantity , @xmath52 = 0 $ ] .",
    "the state space is spanned by the base @xmath53 and we can write each vector state as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the vacuum vector state in the fock space . we can use the states ( [ state1 ] ) to write the matrix representation of the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) . the dimension of the space increase very fast when we increase @xmath56 ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the total number of becs in the system and @xmath56 is a constant @xmath24-number , @xmath59 . in the case where we have only two becs @xcite ( one @xmath60 and one @xmath61 )",
    "the dimension is @xmath62 . in the figs .",

    "i have solved a family of fragmented bose - hubbard models using the multi - states boson lax operators introduced by the author in @xcite .",
