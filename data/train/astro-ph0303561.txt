    "detection of these thermal x - rays is difficult .",
    "the stellar environment is energetic , particularly for young ns , and non - thermal emission processes which originate in the active pulsar magnetosphere dominate the surface radiation .",
    "young pulsars may be obscured by diffuse non - thermal x - ray emission from the supernova remnant or from bright compact nebulae ( plerions ) driven by pulsar winds .",
    "some ns are exceptionally luminous in thermal x - rays possibly owing to either a highly transparent surface composition or to reheating processes which maintain their core temperature , while the thermal and ( brighter ) non - thermal emissions for some cooling ns decline presumably at different rates until the surface radiation can be distinguished at late times .",
    "the fundamental properties of ns thermal radiation are regulated by the source luminosity , the strong surface gravity of the star , and the composition of the atmosphere which is likely determined by either accretion ( from the interstellar medium , a fossil debris disk or stellar companion ) or fall - back of supernova ejecta .",

    "the plasma is strongly polarizing to x - ray radiation at magnetic field strengths comparable to those of radio pulsars .",
    "the optical and uv spectra of such ns are also polarized for modest @xmath3 , but measurement at these wavelengths is difficult owing to the presence of non - thermal radiation , absorption in the interstellar medium , and the overall faintness of the sources .",
    "the large plasma anisotropies induced by magnetic fields strongly affect the angular distribution of the emergent radiation field of the atmosphere , and a complete model of the thermal x - ray emission of a typical ns requires integration over intensity profiles from surface elements having local temperature and magnetic field which vary across the stellar surface @xcite .",

    "@xcite have taken a different computational approach , deriving the first non - lte model calculations in the weak field regime using the accelerated lambda iteration combined with the opacity project cross sections ; these authors find modest corrections due to nlte effects in light element plasma at low temperatures , but these are potentially more significant for magnetic fields stronger than they consider .",
