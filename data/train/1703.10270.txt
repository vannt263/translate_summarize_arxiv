    "we have studied the illumination effect on bulk superconductors .",
    "the optical penetration depth is much smaller than the sample thickness . therefore the contribution of cooper - pair breaking would be neglected .",
    "if a continuous wave ( cw ) laser is used , we expect a nearly equilibrium state and can discuss an accurate thermal effect by laser heating on a bulk superconductor , which has been overlooked . in this study , we present the detailed studies of cw - laser heating by employing cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 and mgb@xmath2 40 k - superconductors@xcite .",

    "the powder x - ray diffraction patterns show almost single phases with small amount of impurity phases .",
    "the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath12 between 20 and 300 k under illumination was measured by the conventional dc four - probe method using a closed - cycle he gas cryostat .",
    "the optical source was a cw laser diode ( ld ) with photon energy of 1.85 ev , which was sufficient for destroying cooper pairs of studied superconductors .",
    "a parallelepiped sample with dimensions of @xmath131.5@xmath141.5@xmath1410 mm@xmath15 was cut from a pellet of each sample , and the distance between the voltage electrodes was 2 to 3 mm .",
    "the sample was glued using varnish onto a thin cu plate covered with a cigarette paper .",
    "the cu plate was then placed on the cooling stage in the cryostat using apiezon n grease as an adhesive that provides good thermal contact .",
    "the temperature was measured by a thermocouple , thermally anchored to the cooling stage underneath the sample .",
    "all electrodes were covered by thin phosphor - bronze plates to reduce any extrinsic photovoltaic effects .",
    "the light beam from the ld was focused onto the area between the voltage electrodes .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows @xmath12 of cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 under the fluence rates denoted in the figure .",
    "the sample in the dark state undergoes superconductivity below @xmath3 of 39.5 k , determined by the midpoint of resistance drop . increasing fluence rate depresses the superconductivity and @xmath3 is not observed down to 25 k at 3.5 w@xmath6 .",

    "@xmath3 is gradually reduced .",
    "we have observed the similar trend of fluence - rate dependence of @xmath3 .",

    "the optical penetration depths of cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 and mgb@xmath2 at 1.85 ev are estimated to be 45 nm and 21 nm , respectively@xcite , using permittivity ( and optical conductivity for mgb@xmath2 ) data@xcite . because each optical penetration depth is much smaller than the sample thickness",
    "@xmath17 1.5 mm , it is not conceivable that the cooper - pair breaking by laser light occurs in the whole sample volume . hereafter the thermal effect due to heating , which is evaluated by a model based on the fourier s law , is discussed .",
    "if all of the light power with fluence rate @xmath18 is transformed into heat in a sample , according to the fourier s law , the temperature rise @xmath19 across the sample thickness under an equilibrium condition can be expressed by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the thermal conductivity of sample .",
    "the conditions of application of eq .",
    "( 1 ) are @xmath17 @xmath22 phonon mean free path and macroscopic measurement time @xmath22 phonon relaxation time .",
    "@xmath17 of each sample is 1.5 mm , which is much longer than the phonon mean free path at most of the order of the lattice constant@xcite .",
    "the macroscopic measurement time of the order of second in this study , is also much longer than the phonon relaxation time , which is usually in pico second order@xcite .",
    "these facts satisfy the assumptions of fourier s law .",
    "since the optical penetration depth is much smaller than @xmath17 , an inhomogeneous temperature gradient in the illuminated volume can be neglected .",
    "therefore the temperature gradient along the sample thickness would be approximately constant , which is the additional important factor for the application of fourier s law .",
    "is expressed by color gradation .",
    "the thin platelet with the black frame is a discretized layer , in which the temperature is assumed to be constant . ]",
    "the sample is discretized along the sample depth @xmath23 by the platelet as thin as possible with the thickness @xmath24 ( see fig .  2 ) . assuming the constant temperature - gradient between the illuminated top surface and the sample bottom with the temperature @xmath25 measured by the thermocouple , @xmath16(t ) at the @xmath26-th layer from the bottom is expressed by @xmath27 ) .",
    "regarding the sample as the parallel circuit of discretized layers , @xmath16 of whole volume is expressed as follows ; @xmath28 by employing the reported @xmath21-data@xcite of cefeaso and mgb@xmath2 , the temperature dependences of calculated @xmath16 in the normal state under selected fluence - rates are presented in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) by solid lines . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , slightly larger calculated-@xmath16 above 75 k compared to the experimental @xmath16 , especially at 3.5 w@xmath6 , is due to the overestimated @xmath19 , which is caused by the employed rather low @xmath21 and/or the neglect of thermal dissipation path in the discretized layer .",
    "the predicted @xmath16 of mgb@xmath2 is in good agreement with experimental one above approximately 70 k ( see fig .",
    "figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) suggest that the parallel circuit model with the fourier s law can semi - quantitatively explain the laser heating of @xmath12 in the normal state .     of cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 under fluence rate of 0.32 and 3.5 w@xmath6 ( filled circles with broken lines ) .",
    "the solid lines are the normal - state @xmath16 under illumination ( blue : 0.32 w@xmath6 , red : 3.5 w@xmath6 ) , calculated by the model based on the fourier s law .",
    "( b)temperature dependence of @xmath16 of mgb@xmath2 under fluence rate of 4.4 w@xmath6 ( filled circles with broken line ) .",
    "the solid line is the normal - state @xmath16 under the illumination , calculated by the model based on the fourier s law . ]",
    "figure 4 displays the temperature dependence of @xmath29 , determined by averaging @xmath19 over the whole sample , at low temperatures for each compound under a higher fluence rate .",
    "if the superconducting state also follows the fourier s law , @xmath3 reduction can be evaluated using @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath3 reductions are 3.5 k ( at 3.5 w@xmath6 ) for cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 and 2.4 k ( at 4.4 w@xmath6 ) for mgb@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the actual @xmath3 reduction for each compound is above approximately 15 k , largely exceeding the estimated temperature - rise due to laser heating .",
    "therefore the fourier s law would not be a dominant factor , leading to the @xmath3-reduction under illumination .    in the report@xcite of pb thin film with 27.5 nm thickness ,",
    "the temperature rise due to laser heating at 3 w@xmath6 is 0.45 k , which is smaller than the @xmath3 reduction of 3.2 k. with increasing film - thickness up to 200 nm , only the laser heating of 0.45 k is obtained .",
    "however , for bulk sample in this study , @xmath3 reduction again largely exceeds the predicted temperature - rise due to laser heating , as in pb thin film with 27.5 nm thickness . since the cooper - pair breaking as in thin film",
    "is not operative in the bulk sample , a model other than the fourier s law is responsible for the observed @xmath3-reductions in cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 and mgb@xmath2 .",
    "our findings strongly suggest that the temperature gradient of the order of a few k across the sample thickness triggers the destruction of bulk superconductivity .",
    "the temperature gradient easily produced by ld might lead to a thermal - instability phenomenon similar to the quench .",

    "5 ( see the open circles ) .",
    "the bad thermal contact was realized by a loose varnish - gluing .",
    "the filled circle data showing @xmath3 of 39.5 k is taken at the condition of a good thermal contact .",
    "when the thermal contact is weakened , @xmath3 is reduced to 25 k , while @xmath12 at the normal state is not largely altered . even in the case of bad thermal contact ,",
    "the actual averaged sample - temperature at @xmath3 of 25 k should be 39 k. this supports that the effect of temperature - gradient across the sample in the superconducting state is different from that in the normal state .    in this study on cefeaso@xmath0f@xmath1",
