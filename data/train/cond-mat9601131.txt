    "the two - dimensional xy - model with random phase - shift , defined in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) below , captures the physics of a variety of physical systems . among them",
    "are xy - magnets with non - magnetic impurities , which are coupled to the xy - spins via the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction,@xcite josephson - junction arrays with geometric disorder,@xcite and crystals with quenched impurities.@xcite disordered xy - models are related to even more physical systems , like impure superconductors .",
    "it is in particular the interest in vortex - glass phases in type - ii superconductors , which motivates an analysis of possible glassy features in the paradigmatic two - dimensional bond - disordered system .",
    "the most fundamental question is , whether this model has an ordered phase . in the absence of disorder",
    ", there exists at low temperatures a phase with quasi long - range order .",
    "the famous kosterlitz - thouless transition separates it from the high - temperature phase with short - ranged order.@xcite the analysis by cardy and ostlund@xcite and more explicitly by rubinstein , shraiman and nelson@xcite predicted that the phase transition should be reentrant in the presence of disorder .",
    "later korshunov suggested,@xcite that the ordered phase might be completely destroyed by disorder .",
    "ozeki and nishimori@xcite showed for models with gauge - invariant disorder distributions , that the phase transition can not be reentrant , leaving open whether the ordered phase does exist or not .",
    "experiments@xcite on josephson junction arrays and simulations@xcite were in favor of the existence of an ordered phase without reentrance .",
    "in this controversial situation nattermann , scheidl , korshunov , and li@xcite as well as cha and fertig@xcite reconsidered only recently the problem and found that the ordered phase _ does _ exist and its boundary _ does not _ have reentrant shape .",
    "the earlier observation of reentrance was attributed to an overestimation of vortex fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "the present study extends refs . and , which focused on the absence of reentrance .",
    "the purpose of this article is to examine in more detail the ordered phase , which is shown to be composed of different _",
    "regions_. they are distinguished by the behavior of vortex correlation functions on large length scales , which are calculated _",
    "quantitatively_. a low - temperature regime is found to exhibit glassy behavior in its correlations .",
    "in addition to the previous studies we find that the strength of disorder is increased under renormalization . this effect does not destroy the ordered phase but it is crucial for the universality type of the transition at low temperatures .    in the following a generalized self - consistent screening approach is applied to the replicated system .",
    "the main improvement compared to earlier approaches@xcite on the same basis is achieved by including all relevant fluctuations and by taking special care when the number of replicas is sent to zero .",
    "we use the replica formalism mainly for two reasons : i ) the calculation of correlations becomes very convenient : one may use an expansion technique ( small fugacity and density of vortices ) which fails@xcite in the unreplicated system .",
    "ii ) we show that in the present model there is _ no _ need for replica symmetry breaking , even at lowest temperatures .",
    "in particular , the reentrance disappears and the glassiness occurs without a breaking of replica symmetry .",
    "this might astonish , since for various disordered systems reentrance has been explained as an artifact of a replica - symmetric ( exact mean - field or approximate variational ) approach , which has been overcome by breaking the replica symmetry.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we set up our model and map it onto an effective coulomb gas .",
    "we recapitulate the breakdown of fugacity expansion in the presence of disorder . in sec .",
    "iii we set up the renormalization group within a self - consistent formulation of screening .",
    "the consistency of this approach in the original and replicated system is demonstrated .",
    "iv is devoted to the evaluation of the self - consistency and the proper performance of the replica limit .",
    "the results of the renormalization group treatment are worked out in sec .",
    "v , which are discussed and compared to the results of previous work in sec .",
    "the xy - model with random phase - shifts is given by the reduced hamiltonian @xmath0 it refers to a square lattice with unit spacing in two dimensions .",
    "an xy - spin with angle @xmath1 is attached to every lattice site ( position @xmath2 ) .",
    "the reduced spin coupling between nearest neighbors @xmath3 reads @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction involves quenched random phase - shifts with variance @xmath5 , which are uncorrelated on different bonds .",
    "thermal fluctuations are weighted according to the partition sum @xmath6    this xy - model can be mapped approximately onto an effective coulomb gas . since this procedure",
    "is well known in the absence of disorder@xcite and can be performed similarly in the presence of disorder , we recall only briefly the main manipulations leading to the effective model . in order to simplify the analysis of model ( [ z ] ) , one can replace approximately the cosine - interaction by the villain - interaction.@xcite thereby an additional variable , the vortex density @xmath7 is introduced .",
    "the decisive advantage of this approximation is , that the hamiltonian becomes bilinear in the angles .",
    "all configurations of the original angles can be expressed in terms of spin - waves and vortices . just as in the pure case ,",
    "spin - waves and vortices decouple energetically .",
    "since spin - waves are simply harmonic , all non - trivial physics arises from vortices with an effective hamiltonian    [ h.eff ] @xmath8    in fourier and real space , and the partition sum @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the integer - valued vortex density , which is subject to thermal fluctuations . on the square lattice @xmath10",
    "is associated with plaquettes ( dual sites ) , which are labeled by @xmath11 in contrast to sites @xmath2 .",
    "thermal _ vortices @xmath7 couple to a background of _ quenched _ vortices @xmath12 .",
    "the last expression means , that the plaquette variable @xmath13 is given by the rotation of variable @xmath14 on the surrounding bonds . from this relation one",
    "immediately derives , that the quenched vortices are gaussian random variables with variance @xmath15 .",
    "a single phase - shift @xmath16 creates a dipole of quenched vortices situated in the plaquettes which have the bond @xmath17 as side .",
    "therefore quenched vortices are anti - correlated and their total vorticity vanishes .",
    "we recognize from eq .",
    "( [ hv.k ] ) , that only neutral configurations of vortices will have finite energy .",
    "hence the partition sum can be restricted to neutral configurations ( i.e. @xmath18 ) like in the pure case .",
    "every such neutral configuration can be imagined as a superposition of dipoles of a vortex ( @xmath19 ) and an antivortex ( @xmath20 ) . in analogy to electrostatics , vortices of the same sign",
    "repel each other and vortices of different sign attract each other .    since the interaction is logarithmic ,",
    "vortices build a coulomb gas .",
    "the interaction is identical among the thermal and quenched component .",
    "the fourier representation ( [ hv.k ] ) of the vortex hamiltonian makes evident , that thermal vortices try to compensate quenched vortices as well as possible .",
    "a perfect compensation is prevented by the fact , that @xmath10 is restricted to integer values , whereas @xmath13 is a continuous random variable .    in eq .",
    "( [ hv.r ] ) we introduced the vortex core energy @xmath21 , where @xmath22 takes the value @xmath23 on a square lattice .",
    "it emerges from the lattice greens function [ cf .",
    "( 4.13a ) of ref . ] .",
    "although @xmath22 has a unique value for the lattice model , it will occasionally be considered as an independent parameter which allows to control the density of vortices irrespectively of @xmath24 . in a dilute vortex system with @xmath25 only",
    ", @xmath26 is comparable to a chemical potential .    in a region of parameters , where vortices are negligible , fluctuations of the original angle variables are given only by spin waves .",
    "they lead to a decay of the spin correlation function@xcite @xmath27 \\rangle } \\sim r^{- \\eta}\\ ] ] with exponent @xmath28 . if the correlation decays algebraically even in the presence of vortices , the system has quasi long - range order .    as vortices are excited thermally , they give rise to additional fluctuations in the angles , the correlation will decay faster .",
    "this effect can be expressed by a renormalized @xmath29 , which becomes scale dependent . if vortices lead to a divergence of the renormalized @xmath29 on large scales , quasi long - range order is destroyed .",
    "however , vortex fluctuations are not only responsible for such a quantitative effect , they also drive the phase transition into the high - temperature phase , where the spin - spin correlation decays exponentially.@xcite    let us estimate , to what extent disorder can favor the excitation of vortices . in the pure case @xmath30 , the ground state of ( [ hv.k ] ) is vortex - free .",
    "the density of vortices vanishes for vanishing temperature , since the creation of quantized vortices always costs finite energy .",
    "therefore the pure system has a phase with quasi long - range order ( [ def.gamma ] ) at low temperatures .",
    "a simple argument shows , that the _ disordered _ system has even at _ zero _ temperature a _ finite density _ of vortices:@xcite we consider two positions at distance @xmath31 and determine the probability of finding there a vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "the energy of such a dipole is given by @xmath32 , where we neglect the core energy for large @xmath31 .",
    "disorder gives and additional energy contribution @xmath33 . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the dipole will be present , if its total energy @xmath35 is negative .",
    "the original gaussian distribution of the random phase - shifts results in a gaussian distribution of @xmath36 with variance @xmath37 .",
    "thus the probability @xmath38 of finding a pair at @xmath34 is finite . in other words",
    ", this shows that in the presence of disorder the ground state is no longer vortex - free and that renormalization effects can be important even at arbitrarily small temperatures .",
    "the goal of the present work is therefore a calculation of such renormalization effects in the presence of random phase - shifts .",
    "we use the conceptual most simple approach , a self - consistent linear response approach . for the pure coulomb gas ,",
    "this approach is equivalent@xcite to the real - space renormalization group of kosterlitz.@xcite we have checked that this equivalence still holds in the presence of disorder .",
    "we now define vortex renormalization effects by macroscopic properties of our system . as a probe",
    "we introduce additional test vortices into the system .",
    "they experience a screened interaction and the screened background potential acting on them .",
    "let us denote the unscreened interaction between vortices @xmath39 .",
    "due to quenched disorder vortices @xmath40 , thermal vortices @xmath7 are subject to a gaussian background potential @xmath41 with variance @xmath42 .",
    "the screened background potential and interaction are identified from the contributions to the free energy of test vortices , which are of first and second order in their vorticity@xcite ( see also appendix [ app.lr ] for some intermediate steps )    [ screen.v ] @xmath43    it is convenient to introduce the ordinary , disconnected , and connected correlation ,    [ def.corr ] @xmath44    for a specific realization of disorder , the screened interaction in principle depends explicitly on the coordinates of both interacting vortices , it is not translation invariant . although we should in principle consider screening in the particular disorder environment , we approximately evaluate only the average screening effect by taking the disorder average , which restores the translation symmetry of the interaction .    from the large - scale behavior of the screened interaction and the variance of the screened potential one can then identify screened parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 as ( for the precise definition see appendix [ app.lr ] )    [ total.screen ] @xmath47    although we do not yet know the correlation functions , we may establish from these expressions criteria for the existence of an ordered phase . in this phase , we expect vortices to give rise only to finite screening effects , i.e. the screened parameters must have finite values .",
    "this requires @xmath48 and a similar condition for the disconnected correlation .    in the limit of large core energy",

    "absence of disorder , one finds * * ? ? ?",
    "* * @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the condition for the ordered phase then simply reads @xmath51 , in agreement with the condition that the free energy a single vortex has to be positive.@xcite a similar argument can be constructed for the disordered system at @xmath34 , where one can estimate @xmath52 using eq .",
    "( [ prob.dipole ] ) .",
    "then the condition for order reads @xmath53 .",
    "this argument already disproves previous predictions,@xcite that infinitesimal @xmath54 would destroy order at @xmath34 .    for finite core energy , screening effects",

    "( [ partial.screen ] ) suggests a simple `` two - component picture '' illustrating the screening effects of vortices .",

    "both components contribute equally to a renormalization of the spin exponent .",
    "this virtual separation into two components must not be taken literally .",
    "it is impossible to assign a particular dipole uniquely to one of the two components .",
    "the two - component picture is analogous to the two - fluid model of superfluidity , which also must not be taken literally in the sense that a particular atom would be either superfluid or normalfluid .    in order to take advantage from the differential screening equations",
