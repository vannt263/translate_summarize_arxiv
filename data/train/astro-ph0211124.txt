    "be / x - ray binaries typically show two types of outburst behavior : ( a ) giant outbursts ( or type ii ) , characterized by high luminosities ( @xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 ) and high spin - up rates ( i.e. , a significant increase in pulse frequency ) and ( b ) normal outbursts ( or type i ) , characterized by lower luminosities ( @xmath6 ergs s@xmath5 ) , low spin - up rates ( if any ) , and recurrence at the orbital period @xcite . as a population",

    "to determine pulse frequencies for xte j1946 + 274 , we performed a grid search over a range of candidate frequencies using data from the large area detectors on batse@xcite .",
    "this search technique is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will briefly summarize the technique here .",
    "variations of this technique , including searches in pulse period , have been widely used ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "the pulsar search technique consists of 3 steps ( 1 ) data selection and combination , ( 2 ) 20 - 50 kev pulse profile estimates , and ( 3 ) a grid search in frequency .",
    "first , the batse discla channel 1 ( 20 - 50 kev , 1 s time resolution ) data were selected for which the source was visible , the high voltage was on , the spacecraft was outside the south atlantic anomaly , and no electron precipitation events or other anomalies were flagged by the batse mission operations team .",
    "the count rates were combined over the 4 lads viewing xte j1946 + 274 , using weights optimized for an exponential energy spectrum , @xmath20 with temperature @xmath21 kev , and grouped into @xmath22 s segments .",
    "a segment length of 300 s was used because it was short enough that the background was well - fitted by a quadratic model .",
    "the segment boundaries were chosen to avoid earth occultation steps from bright sources@xcite .    the second step in this process was estimation of an initial 20 - 50 kev pulse profile for each segment of data . in each segment , the combined rates were fitted with a model consisting of a sixth - order fourier expansion in pulse phase ( representing the 20 - 50 kev pulse profile ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the estimated complex fourier coefficient for harmonic where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the pulse frequency . ] @xmath27 in segment @xmath28 and a spline function with quadratics in time ( representing the background plus mean source count rate ) .",
    "a sixth - order fourier expansion was chosen based on the number of harmonics that are significant in a 1-day observation , the typical integration time required to detect xte j1946 + 274 .",
    "our initial pulse phase model was of the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 mhz before mjd 51270 and @xmath31 mhz after mjd 51270 were barycentric frequencies and @xmath32 was the time corrected to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de-200 ephemeris @xcite .",
    "the initial pulse frequency was changed after mjd 51270 because continued spin - up of the pulsar moved the observed frequency too far away from the folding frequency .",
    "the value and slope of the spline function were required to be continuous across adjacent 300 s segment boundaries , but not across data gaps .",
    "ideally we would like to be able to fit a pulse profile to the entire 4-day interval of data for each frequency grid point ; however this is computationally very very expensive .",
    "instead we have formulated an equivalent method in which we first fit pulse profiles to short segments of data using a single fixed frequency .",
    "then the profiles are combined and shifted by a frequency offset corresponding to each grid point .",
    "fitting pulse profiles to short data segments has other advantages in addition to improving computational efficiency .",
    "( 1 ) if the folding frequency chosen was incorrect , the profile will be smeared out .",
    "however , the degree of smearing in pulse phase @xmath33 is approximately given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an offset in frequency , @xmath36 is the segment length , and @xmath37 is the number of fourier coefficients . for @xmath38",
    "s , @xmath39 mhz , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , which corresponds to a drop in the amplitude of the sixth harmonic by 15% .",
    "the amplitude of the first harmonic only drops by about 0.4% .",
    "using a short segment reduces smearing of the pulse profile .",
    "( 2 ) typically 470 pulse profiles from the 300 s segments are accumulated within each 4-day interval . since we have a large number of profiles we can estimate sample variances for each fourier coefficient .",
    "sample variances give us a measure of the noise present in the data and account for aperiodic noise if it is present .",
    "the final step in our advanced pulsar search was a grid search in frequency using the set of typically several hundred estimated 20 - 50 kev pulse profiles from 4-day intervals of data .",
    "new xte j1946 + 274 pulse frequencies were determined from an initial grid search over 1200 evenly spaced trial barycentric frequencies in the range 62.97 - 63.32 mhz for mjd 48361 - 51270 and 63.10 - 63.45 mhz for mjd 51270 - 51690 .",
    "the search range was changed because continued spin - up of the pulsar moved the pulse frequencies outside the original search range . for each frequency",
    "offset @xmath35 , a mean pulse profile is computed for each 4-day interval .",
    "the mean pulse profile is of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the midpoint barycentric time of segment @xmath28 .",
    "the mean coefficients @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 with weights @xmath48 .",
    "the typical statistic used for a search in pulse frequency or pulse period is the @xmath49 statistic @xcite given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the formal ( i.e. , poisson statistical ) error on the fourier coefficient @xmath46 , respectively . if aperiodic noise is present , either due to xte j1946 + 274 or due to other sources in the large batse field of view , e.g. , cygnus x-1 , the poisson statistical error is an underestimate because the actual underlying noise level is higher than poisson noise",
    "this can create a problem with the @xmath49 statistic , causing it to depend on the noise level . to account for aperiodic noise , we used all of the typically @xmath52 pulse profiles from 300 s segments within each 4-day interval to estimate sample variances for the fourier coefficients for each harmonic in the mean profile .",
    "each harmonic was treated separately .",
    "we then modified the @xmath49 statistic by replacing the poisson variances with our computed sample variances to create a new statistic which we will call @xmath53 after @xcite where it is described in detail . due to the large field - of - view of batse , other pulsars were often also present when we were measuring xte j1946 + 274 .",
    "if we limited our statistic to use the first 3 harmonics where xte j1946 + 274 was the brightest , we reduced the chances of contamination of the search results from other pulsars that happen to have harmonics near the higher harmonics of xte j1946 + 274 .",
    "the best - fit frequency for each 4-day interval was then determined using the @xmath54 statistic .    using a similar method we also generated pulse frequency measurements for _ rxte _ pca observations during the initial outburst in 1998 september - october and during the last 2 outbursts , 2001 march - july .",
    "barycentered standard 1 ( 125 ms , no energy resolution ) data were fitted with a model consisting of a constant background plus a 6th - order fourier expansion in pulse phase model , creating an estimated 2 - 60 kev pulse profile for each pca observation .",
    "the pulsed phase model consisted of a constant barycentric frequency , @xmath55 mhz for the 1998 september - october observations and @xmath56 mhz for the 2001 observations , estimated from projections of batse measurements .",
    "for each set of observations , we searched over a grid of 151 evenly spaced frequencies spanning the range @xmath57 mhz , the same size interval as used for batse .",
    "figures  [ fig : freqs]a & c show the barycentered pulse frequency history and the 2 - 10 kev total flux history , respectively , for xte j1946 + 274 . in figure  [",
    "fig : freqs]a , the trend in the pulse frequencies repeatedly changes from spin - up to spin down and back to spin - up at regular intervals ( every  170 days ) .",
    "this repeated pattern is most likely due to the pulsar s orbit . within each 170 day cycle in the pulse frequencies , there are two outbursts .",
    "examination of the observed pulse frequency history showed us two things : ( 1 ) a strong orbital signature and ( 2 ) strong intrinsic torque variations . to attempt to extract orbital parameters , we first fitted the observed pulse frequencies @xmath58 with a model consisting of a global orbit and a global polynomial frequency model , i.e. , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a model of the emitted frequency .",
    "the velocity relative to the observer @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the projected semi - major axis of the pulsar s orbit ; @xmath64 is the orbital period ; @xmath65 is the periapse angle ; and @xmath66 is the orbital eccentricity ; @xmath67 is the eccentric anomaly , given by @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the epoch of periastron passage .",
    "we fitted models containing polynomials of orders 1 - 10 .",
    "all of these models were very poor fits .",
    "table  [ tab : orb ] lists the orbital parameters obtained using a first and 10th order polynomial for comparison .",
    "errors on these parameters have been inflated by a factor of @xmath70 , but are still expected to be considerably underestimated because the @xmath71 values are so large .",
    "figure  [ fig : poly ] shows the emitted frequency model @xmath72 , @xmath73 the constant term from the emitted frequency model times the velocity relative to the observer to illustrate the amplitude of orbital effects , the full frequency model including the emitted frequency and orbit , and the frequency residuals for the 10th order polynomial model .",
    "clearly a simple model such as a global polynomial did not suffice to describe the intrinsic torques .",
    "instead we decided to model the intrinsic torques in a piecewise fashion .",
    "each outburst was split into 2 - 6 intervals , depending on the length of the outburst , where each interval contained 3 - 4 frequency measurements and spanned 16 - 24 days or 16 - 32 days for the batse and the _ rxte _ pca data , respectively . in each interval , we fitted the observed pulse frequencies with a global orbit plus an independent linear frequency model , equation  [ eqn : fobs ] with @xmath74 as a model of the emitted frequency for each time interval @xmath75 .",
    "table  [ tab : orb ] lists our best fit orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig : resid ] shows @xmath72 , @xmath76 to illustrate the amplitude of orbital variations ( note @xmath77 was chosen because it lies in near the center of the frequency range . ) , the full frequency model including the emitted frequency and orbit , and the frequency fit residuals .",
    "this fit is not formally acceptable either ; however , we believe this is mostly because this model still does not completely describe the intrinsic torques .",
    "errors on the individual parameters in table  [ tab : orb ] have been inflated by @xmath78 .",

    "seen in figure  [ fig : freqs]a has been removed , while intrinsic torque effects remain in the data .",
    "a close look at figure  [ fig : freqs ] indicates that the outbursts are not fixed in orbital phase and that we are seeing approximately 2 outbursts per orbit . to study the orbital phase of the outbursts",
    ", we fitted the 2 - 10 kev _ rxte _ asm flux in figure  [ fig : freqs]c with a quartic polynomial , and used this polynomial to normalize the outbursts .",
    "we then computed the orbital position using @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the semi - major axis , estimated from @xmath63 assuming @xmath81 which gives a companion mass of @xmath82 .",

    ", we reduced @xmath80 by 10% to offset the orbits .",
    "this plot spirals in solely to allow comparison of outburst phases .",
    "we are not claiming that the neutron star is spiraling in toward its companion .",
    "the outburst peaks clearly are not fixed in orbital phase , although there is typically one peak on each side of the orbit . just before periastron and just before apastron , the flux is typically relatively low .",
    "the cause of these low flux periods is unclear .",
    "although the fluxes show considerable modulation , they remain detectable with _ rxte _ throughout the period 1998 september - 2001 july .      to look for variations in energy spectra during the outbursts observed with the _ rxte _ pca , we first studied hardness ratios . using ftools 5.1 @xcite and standard2 ( 16-s , 129 energy channel ) data",
    ", we created light curves in 4 energy bands corresponding to 2 - 5 , 5 - 10 , 10 - 15 , and 15 - 20 kev for both the 1998 and 2001 outbursts .",
    "these light curves were background subtracted and their times were corrected to the solar system barycenter using ftools .",
    "next we formed 3 hardness ratios from adjacent energy bands .",

    "for all of the hardness ratios , we see a correlation between hardness and intensity in the 2001 outburst that is not present in the 1998 outburst . in the color - color diagrams ,",
    "the hardness ratios are correlated for both sets of outbursts and have similar slopes . however , during the 2001 outbursts , points move from left to right along the correlation as intensity increases ; while in the 1998 outburst , the points move around in hardness as intensity increases .    to better quantify the observed spectral changes , we generated response matrices , count spectra , and background spectra using ftools for pca standard2 data and hexte event mode data for each observation .",
    "we then fitted each of the observations in xspec 11.1 @xcite with two models : ( 1 ) an absorbed power law with a high - energy cutoff and an iron line , xspec model : phabs ( powerlaw + gaussian ) highecut@xmath85 and ( 2 ) an absorbed power law with an iron line and a cyclotron absorption feature , xspec model : phabs ( powerlaw + gaussian ) cyclabs@xmath85 .",
    "for both models we used only data in the 2.7 - 30 kev energy range for pca data and in the 15 - 50 kev range for hexte .",
    "the power law normalizations were allowed to be independent for the pca and each hexte cluster .",

    "we aligned all of the pulse profiles by finding the phase of the minimum of the profile using a quadratic interpolation and placing that minimum at phase 0.0 .",
    "we found definite variations with intensity in both the 1998 and 2001 outbursts and also evidence that the pulse profile was different at similar intensities during the rise and fall of the initial bright outburst",
    ".    profiles with similar shapes and similar intensities were averaged to better illustrate the observed shape changes .",
    "figure  [ fig : intprof]a shows the average 2 - 30 kev pulse profile at 6 different intensities .",
    "figure  [ fig : intprof]b shows the peak - to - peak pulse fraction versus mean flux for each profile . in the following descriptions and in figures  [ fig : intprof]a and b , the pulse profiles are numbered from one to six . ( 1 ) at the lowest intensities ( 6 - 17 counts s@xmath5 pcu@xmath5 , 2 - 30 kev ) , during the 2001 outbursts , the profile s main feature was a deep notch , which we used to align the profiles . the profile consisted of an asymmetric structured main peak that peaked near phase 0.2 .",
    "( 2 ) as the intensity increased ( 23 - 65 counts s@xmath5 pcu@xmath5 ) , a second notch becomes prominent near phase 0.45 , making the profile consist of two main peaks .",
    "these peaks were approximately equal in intensity at first , but the second peak brightens as the overall intensity increases .",
    "a small peak near phase 0.87 also appears .",
    "no _ rxte _ pca observations were taken at intensities between 65 and 178 counts s@xmath5 pcu@xmath5 .",
    "( 3 ) the next profile shape occurs at intensities of 178 - 266 counts s@xmath5 pcu@xmath5 , near the end of the 1998 outburst .",
    "this profile is markedly different from that near the peak of the 2001 outburst ( profile 2 ) .",
    "both notches are broader , the peak near phase 0.65 is brighter than the peak near phase 0.3 and the small peak at phase 0.87 has disappeared .",
    "the main notch appears to be less deep than at lower intensities .",
    "( 4 ) profiles at intensities of 285 - 308 and 330 counts s@xmath5 pcu@xmath5 , all from the rise of the 1998 outburst , show a broader first peak and a less intense shoulder following the second peak than the lower intensity profiles from the fall of the outburst ( profile 3 ) . ( 5 ) at intensities of 322 - 328 counts s@xmath5 pcu@xmath5 , during the decline of the 1998 outburst , the first peak is narrower than at similar intensities during the outburst rise ( profile 4 ) , but broader than at lower intensities during the decline ( profile 3 ) .",
    "( 6 ) at the peak of the outburst , the width of the first peak is at an intermediate width between the profiles from the rise and fall of the outburst . during the 2001 outbursts",
    ", the profile shape appeared to depend primarily on intensity , while during the 1998 bright outburst , the profile shape depended on both intensity and whether the profile was from the rise or fall of the outburst .",
    "next we looked for variations in the pulse profile versus energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : profvsenergy ] shows pulse profiles in 5 energy bands from the peak of the 1998 outburst ( left panel ) and near one of the peaks in the pair of outbursts in 2001 ( right panel ) . in the 1998 profiles , the profile consists of two main peaks at lower energies ( @xmath148 kev ) .",
    "the first peak is dominant at lower energies and the second peak becomes more dominant as energy increases .",
    "also , as energy increases , the notch between the two main peaks fills in . as the 2 - 30 kev intensity decreases , the profile",
    " shape \" appears to move down in energy .",
    "for example , in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig : profvsenergy ] , the 2 - 5 kev profile consists of two nearly equal peaks , reminiscent of the 10 - 15 kev profile at the peak of the 1998 outburst .",
    "a regular monitoring program was established to study the strength and structure of the h@xmath3 optical emission line during the x - ray observations in 2001 .",
    "this line arises from the circumstellar disk surrounding the be star and the line properties are strongly related to the extent and dynamic structure of the disk .",
    "data were primarily collected from the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) in la palma , spain .",
    "the int was equipped with the 235-mm camera and eev#10 ccd . the use of the r1200r grating results in a nominal dispersion of @xmath149 / pixel .",
    "intermediate resolution spectroscopy was also performed on 17th july 2001 and 22nd october 2001 using the 1.93-m telescope at the observatoire de haute provence , france .",
    "that telescope was equipped with the long - slit spectrograph _ carelec _ and the @xmath150 eev ccd .",
    "we used the 1200 ln / mm grating in first order , resulting in a nominal dispersion of @xmath151 / pixel . see table  [ tab :",
    "ha ] for details .",
    "the h@xmath3 profile obtained from each observation is presented in figure  [ fig : ha ] .",
    "the lines have been shifted vertically by an arbitrary amount in order to present each profile clearly .",
    "the data of the 17 july and 7 october 2001 are of a lower standard due to poor weather conditions .",
    "nonetheless it is possible to accurately determine the equivalent width of each of the emission lines ; values are presented in table  [ tab : ha ] . from these numbers",
    "one can see that there is little evidence for any changes in the line flux , assuming a constant continuum .",
    "however , from figure  [ fig : ha ] , one can see obvious shifts in the line position after 2001 july .",
    "if one takes the first spectrum ( 3 may 2001 ) as a base line and subtracts it from each of the other spectra after they have been normalized to the same peak value , then significant changes are apparent .",
    "the result of this process is shown in figure  [ fig : diff ] .",
    "it is apparent that little happens to the profiles ( and , presumably , the circumstellar disk ) until july / august 2001 .",
    "starting with the spectrum of 17 july 2001 one can see significant perturbations occurring in the line profile indicative of density changes in the disk structure . between august and september the direction of the perturbation changes , suggesting that the density enhancement / rarefication had changed sides ( or rotated around ) in the disk .",
    "the size of the perturbation also seems to have been increasing from july to october , though the separation of the red and blue peaks remains approximately constant at @xmath152340 km / s .",
    "xte j1946 + 274 is a very unusual be / x - ray binary system and its behavior does not fit well into the standard normal / giant outburst behavior .",
    "instead it showed an extended period of activity from 1998 september - 2001 july when the x - ray flux showed considerable modulation , with two peaks or outbursts per orbit , but the x - ray flux never dropped below the detection threshold of _",
    "this extended period of activity more closely resembles a series of normal outbursts than a single giant outburst ; however , unlike typical normal outbursts , these outbursts shift rapidly in orbital phase , there are two outbursts per orbit , and the x - ray flux does not drop dramatically between outbursts .",
    "the initial outburst shows considerable spin - up @xmath153 hz s@xmath5 , like a giant outburst , but this spin - up is not substantially larger than that seen in later outbursts .",
    "in addition , the peak flux ( 2 - 60 kev ) of the initial outburst is about @xmath154 ergs @xmath87 s@xmath5 , while the peak flux ( 2 - 60 kev ) of the last two outbursts observed with the pca is about @xmath155 ergs @xmath87 s@xmath5 , only a factor of @xmath156 fainter than the brightest outburst .",
    "these fluxes correspond to luminosities of @xmath157 ergs s@xmath5and @xmath158 ergs s@xmath5 , respectively , assuming our best - fit distance of 9.5 kpc .    in giant outbursts of be / x - ray binaries ,",
    "accretion disks are expected to be present and indeed , evidence for an accretion disk , based on correlations between the observed flux and spin - up rate , has been found for several sources during giant outbursts @xcite .",
    "independent evidence for an accretion disk based on the detection of quasi - periodic oscillations during a giant outburst has been found for exo 2030 + 375 @xcite and a0535 + 262 @xcite . until recently , normal outbursts were believed to be due to direct wind accretion from the be disk , so significant spin - up was not expected because direct wind accretion is not believed to be very efficient at transferring angular momentum @xcite .",
    "if enough angular momentum is present in the accreted material , an accretion disk will form . however",
    ", evidence for spin - up during normal outbursts has been observed in gs 0834430 @xcite , 2s 1417624 @xcite , 2s 1845024 @xcite , and in exo 2030 + 375 @xcite .",
    "we see a correlation between spin - up and flux for xte j1946 + 274 as shown in figure  [ fig : fdotvsflux ] .",
    "the spin - up rate and its correlation with bolometric flux during xte j1946 + 274 s outbursts suggest an accretion disk may be present .",
    "in addition , our calculations show that the specific angular momentum of the accreted material is comparable to the keplerian specific angular momentum , hence a disk is expected to form in xte j1946 + 274 .",
    "further , our fit to the spin - up vs. bolometric flux correlation , which assumed a disk was present , yielded a distance of @xmath2 kpc which is consistent with the distance of 8 - 10 kpc derived from optical observations @xcite .",
    "hence an accretion disk is likely to be present in xte j1946 + 274 .    between 2001",
    "july 31 ( mjd 52121 ) and 2001 august 9 ( mjd 52130 ) , xte j1946 + 274 dropped below the pca s detection threshold . at approximately the same time , between 2001 june 29 ( mjd 52089 ) and 2001 july 17 ( mjd 52107 ) , the h@xmath3 profile began to change rapidly .",
    "the profile was stable for 3 observations on 2001 may 3 , may 10 , and june 29 ( mjd 52032 , 52039 , & 52089 ) that corresponded to x - ray observations during the decline of the second to last outburst , during the low state between the last two outbursts , and near the peak of the last outburst .",
    "the coincidence of the change in h@xmath3 with the x - ray turn - off suggests that changes in the be disk caused the x - ray outbursts to cease .    to determine whether or not the observed x - ray turn - off was due to centrifugal inhibition of accretion @xcite",
    ", we estimate the flux at the onset of this effect by equating the magnetospheric radius to the corotation radius .",
    "the magnetospheric radius is given by equation  [ eqn : rm ] and the corotation radius is given by @xmath159 where @xmath26 is the spin frequency of the pulsar .",
    "setting @xmath160 gives the threshold flux for the onset of centrifugal inhibition of accretion , i.e. , @xmath161 where @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 are the pulsar s magnetic moment in units of @xmath166 g @xmath131 , mass in units of 1.4 @xmath167 , radius in units of @xmath168 cm , and spin period in units of 15.8 seconds , respectively .",
    "using @xmath169 kpc and @xmath170 g @xmath121 yields @xmath171 ergs @xmath87 s@xmath5@xmath172 .",
    "for @xmath173 , @xmath174 ergs @xmath87 s@xmath5 .",
    "our measured upper limit fluxes are in the range @xmath175 ergs @xmath87 s@xmath5 , consistent with xte j1946 + 274 entering the centrifugal inhibition of accretion regime when the x - rays became undetectable with the pca .",
    "we propose that xte j1946 + 274 is a system in which the be star s equatorial plane and the orbital plane are not aligned .",
    "this is suggested by : ( 1 ) the optical observations show a relatively narrow fwhm ( 8.6   on 2001 may 10 , which corresponds to @xmath176 200 km s@xmath5 ) for the single - peaked h@xmath3 line , indicating that the be star is viewed from a relatively low inclination angle , i.e. , nearly pole - on .",
    "( 2 ) the orbital signature is quite obvious in the pulse frequencies , indicating that the orbital inclination angle is likely not low : the derived mass function @xmath177 from the piecewise frequency model indicates an inclination angle @xmath178  for the expected mass range of @xmath13 derived from optical observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc ] shows the range of allowed inclinations using the 1-@xmath179 errors on the mass function .",
    "we see two outbursts per orbit in xte j1946 + 274 ; however , these outbursts are not fixed in orbital phase . this combination of behaviors is unique to xte j1946 + 274 and is likely not due to a single mechanism .",
    "the optical data and mass function suggest that the orbital plane and the be disk are not aligned in this system .",
    "such a misaligned system would be expected to produce two outbursts per orbit , each approximately corresponding to the neutron star s passage through the be disk ; hence these outbursts would be expected to be fixed in orbital phase . for xte j1946 + 274 ,",
    "we are faced with the difficult task of explaining not only why we see the expected two outbursts per orbit , but also why these outbursts are not fixed in orbital phase .",
    "we propose that given the relatively high luminosities and spin - up rates in all of the outbursts that perhaps xte j1946 + 274 s unusual outburst behavior can be explained as a giant outburst . in normal outbursts ,",
    "the be disk is expected to be truncated at a resonance radius by tidal forces from the neutron star s orbit @xcite ; however , in giant outbursts , where much more material is believed to be present in the disk , it is believed that the disk is no longer truncated .",
    "hence more material likely means a larger disk around the be star .",
    "density perturbations propagating in the be disk could change the contact points of the disk and the orbit .",
    "these perturbations would have to be moving quite rapidly in the disk .",
    "this idea of a giant outburst combined with density perturbations seems most likely to work in a system where the inclination angle between the be disk and the orbital plane is fairly small .",
    "it is not clear that this angle is small in xte j1946 + 274 .",
    "we do not claim that the idea of a giant outburst in an inclined system fully explains the behavior observed from xte j1946 + 274 .",
    "instead we put the idea forth as a suggestion to those doing simulations of these systems .",
    "the phasing of the outbursts of xte j1946 + 274 ( see figure  [ fig : orbphase ] ) is difficult to understand .",
    "however , it is not the first be / x - ray binary to show shifts in outburst phase .",
    "exo 2030 + 375 underwent a fairly sudden ( within 4 orbits ) shift in the peak phase of the outbursts from 6 days after periastron ( phase @xmath180 ) to 2.5 days before periastron ( phase -0.05 ) , followed by a gradual shift in outburst phase to 2.5 days after periastron ( phase 0.05 ) .",
    "this shift was believed to be associated with a density perturbation observed in the be disk via h@xmath3 observations @xcite .",
    "gs 0834430 also underwent sudden shifts in outburst phase , undergoing 9 outbursts approximately centered on periastron , followed by dramatic shifts to outbursts centered on phases 0.37 and 0.75 @xcite .",
    "a companion was not known at the time for gs 0834430 , so we can not confirm that density perturbations in the be disk were responsible for these phase shifts . in xte j1946 + 274 , we have a similar problem , with the companion not observed for much of the time the x - ray outbursts were occurring .",
    "in addition , the problem is compounded by the fact that we are likely viewing the be star nearly pole - on ; hence the range of projected rotational velocities is very small , making it difficult to detect perturbed velocities which indicate density perturbations .",
    "only large density perturbations , such as the one that coincided with the x - ray turn - off , are likely to be detected .",
    "we are grateful to luisa morales for providing one of the optical spectra .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) .",
    "asm quick - look results were provided by the asm/ _ rxte _ teams at mit and at the gsfc sof and gof . the int is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
