    "the time evolution of quantum systems away from equilibrium is of interest in many applications including , but certainly not limited to , phase transition dynamics , inflationary reheating , and heavy ion collisions .",
    "large @xmath0 expansions have provided a widely used technique for studying equilibrium properties in statistical physics and field theory @xcite , and it is natural to apply a similar strategy for studying non - equilibrium problems . the large @xmath0 limit ( as typically formulated ) is actually a special type of classical limit @xcite .",
    "suitable observables behave classically and the quantum dynamics reduces to classical dynamics on an appropriate phase space .",
    "considerable work has been done examining the dynamics of far from equilibrium states in a variety of applications using leading large-@xmath0 time - evolution @xcite .",
    "a major virtue of large @xmath0 techniques ( compared to alternative wholly uncontrolled approximation schemes ) is that one should be able to improve the approximation by systematically including sub - leading effects suppressed by powers of @xmath2 . for a variety of equilibrium problems ( such as critical phenomena ) , this approach can work quite well @xcite .",
    "for initial value problems , in which one would like to choose a non - equilibrium initial state and then examine the subsequent time evolution , traditional formulations of large-@xmath0 expansions using graphical or functional integral techniques @xcite are very awkward .",
    "a major difficulty with these approaches is that they generate integral equations which are non - local in time when sub - leading @xmath2 corrections are retained . for practical ( numerical ) applications",
    ", one would vastly prefer a formulation in which locality in time is always preserved .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a formulation of large @xmath0 ( or semi - classical ) dynamics which leads to a coupled hierarchy of time - local evolution equations for equal time correlation functions .",
    "our approach directly exploits the appropriate group structure underlying the construction of suitable coherent states and the existence of the classical limit @xcite .",
    "we specifically focus on the time evolution of initial states chosen to equal one of these coherent states",
    ". we will give explicit next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , expressions for the required evolution equations .",
    "somewhat related hierarchies of evolution equations have been discussed in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "because of our exploitation of the underlying group structure , the formulation we derive is more efficient , in the sense that it requires integration of fewer coupled equations at a given order in @xmath2 .    a major question which we discuss , but do not fully resolve , is the propagation of errors induced by truncating the exact ( infinite ) hierarchy at a given order in @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that the @xmath3 limit is not uniform in time .",
    "for example , in typical large @xmath0 field theories the characteristic time scales for scattering or thermalization are known to scale as @xmath0 to some positive power . for a fixed time interval @xmath4 ,",
    "results obtained by integrating evolution equations truncated at , for example , next - to - leading order , will have only order @xmath5 errors . for sufficiently large @xmath0 , and fixed @xmath4 , including successively higher orders in the @xmath2 hierarchy will yield more accurate results .",
    "but for fixed @xmath0 and some given truncation of the @xmath2 hierarchy , it should be expected that the truncation error will grow with increasing time and eventually become order unity .",
    "a key question is how this `` breakdown '' time scales with @xmath0 and the order of the truncation .",
    "one might hope that a next - to - leading order approximation would be useful [ that is , have at most @xmath6 global errors ] for times of order @xmath0 , while a next - to - next - to - leading order scheme would be useful out to times of order @xmath7 , _ etc_. but it is quite conceivable that errors in an order-@xmath8 truncation will grow with time like @xmath9 for some positive @xmath10 , which would imply that all truncations break down after a time of order @xmath11",
    ". this behavior , which we consider likely , may well depend on the specific theory and choice of initial state .",
    "available numerical work , such as @xcite , sheds little light on this issue .",
    "we discuss several examples where it is possible to argue that quantum `` decoherence '' produces exactly this type of limit on the range of validity of large @xmath0 truncations .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . the general framework which allows us to treat many theories with a classical limit in a uniform fashion",
    "is outlined in section ii .",
    "this material is largely taken from ref .",
    "section iii describes the particular class of operators we will consider , and examines the structure of their coherent state equal time correlators .",
    "section iv presents the resulting time evolution equations and discusses error propagation .",
    "these general results are applied to the examples of point particle quantum mechanics , and a general @xmath0-component vector model , in section v. for point particle quantum mechanics , we argue that the decoherence time generically scales as @xmath12 , while for vector models it should scale as @xmath1 . a brief concluding discussion follows .",
    "the following slightly abstract framework is applicable to typical large @xmath0 limits ( including @xmath13 or @xmath14 invariant vector models , matrix models , and non - abelian gauge theories ) , as well as the @xmath15 limit of ordinary quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "the equations of motion that govern the classical dynamics are just coherent state expectations of the original quantum evolution equations .",
    "as noted earlier , the irreducibility of the coherence group implies that all operators may be ( formally ) constructed from the generators of the coherence group .",

    "of course , subtracted expectations may always be rewritten in terms of connected expectations ( and vice - versa ) .",

    "here we have introduced `` ordered derivatives '' @xmath96 defined by    @xmath97    [ operator - derivatives ]    when acting on a string of generators , ordered derivatives produce a sum of products of expectations of the generators which remain after deleting the indicated generators , provided these appear ( not necessarily contiguously ) somewhere within the string in the order specified by the derivative .",
