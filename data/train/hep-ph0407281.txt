    "the very fortunate discovery @xcite of a new resonance in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels has been awaited for over two decades @xcite .",
    "excitations of @xmath6 @xmath2 states have been foreseen in the past , but with higher masses .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite two states were forecast at 2.73 and 2.90 gev , one for each of the possible angular configurations @xmath7 and @xmath8 , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite these states were predicted at 2.773 and 2.813 gev .",
    "nowadays , a mass of 2.632 gev is of no surprise . just consider the mass differences between the ground states and first radial excitations of other @xmath6 mesons , which vary from 0.52 gev for @xmath9 to 0.59 gev for @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath4 resonance , being 0.52 gev heavier than the @xmath11 ground state , could thus perfectly well turn out be the first radial excitation of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "however , the branching ratio of its two decay modes , i.e. , @xmath0 to @xmath1 , with the latter one dominating by a factor of six , seems to be problematic @xcite .",
    "also its decay width ( smaller than 17 mev @xcite ) is smaller than expected for a @xmath2 resonance with sufficient phase space in a two - meson channel observing the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) @xcite rule .    this small decay width , and the puzzling branching ratio to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "are explained by maiani _",
    "_ @xcite assuming a dominantly @xmath12\\left[\\bar{d}\\bar{s}\\right]$ ] four - quark configuration , whereas liu _",
    "@xcite argue that the @xmath4 resonance may be a member of a flavor 15-plet , which is a mixture of @xmath13\\left[\\bar{u}\\bar{s}\\right]$ ] , @xmath12\\left[\\bar{d}\\bar{s}\\right]$ ] , and @xmath14\\left[\\bar{s}\\bar{s}\\right]$ ] .",
    "other tetraquark proposals can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , namely @xmath15\\left[u\\bar{u}\\!+\\!d\\bar{d}\\right]$ ] and @xmath12\\left[\\bar{d}\\bar{s}\\right]$ ] , respectively .",
    "a radial excitation of the @xmath11 is suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , among other possibilities .    here",
    ", we shall show that the observed properties are compatible with the predictions of a multichannel quark - meson model , designed to describe mesonic resonances in terms of systems of coupled @xmath16 and two - meson states @xcite .",
    "however , the study of non - ground - state @xmath17 vector mesons requires a more elaborate approach than the one previously applied by us to scalar mesons @xcite , as we shall explain in the following .    in the first place",
    ", @xmath18 systems consisting of a charm quark and a strange antiquark may appear in two different orbital excitations , namely @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that instead of one @xmath2 channel , as in the case of the @xmath21 resonance @xcite , we must now consider two such channels .",
    "secondly , higher radial and angular excitations of @xmath2 can decay into a variety of different ozi - allowed two - meson channels , while the influence of nearby closed two - meson channels must be taken into account , too . in table",
    "[ mmchannels ] , we summarize the twenty - eight mesonic decay channels of the @xmath2 system that we consider of importance in the energy region of interest .",
    "thirdly , the phenomenological resonance - spectrum - expansion ( rse ) formalism employed in refs .",
    "@xcite is not practicable in the present case , exactly because of the proliferation of relevant two - meson channels involved . in the rse method , one term in",
    "the expansion accounts for one radial or angular @xmath16 channel coupled to one meson - meson channel .",
    "now , each term comes with a different parameter for each combination of one of the @xmath2 channels and one of the two - meson channels . thus imagining four terms in the expansion ,",
    "then with two channels in the @xmath2 sector and twenty - eight channels in the two - meson sector we would end up with many parameters : clearly enough to fit anything , but not very useful for predictions .    nonetheless , with a definite choice for the confinement potential , these ambiguities are readily removed . here",
    ", we opt for a harmonic oscillator , which has the additional advantage that the relative decay couplings , given in table  [ mmchannels ] , can be determined through the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since , moreover , we consider only one flavor state with reasonably heavy decay products , it is justified to work in the spherical - delta - shell approximation for the @xmath22 communication between the @xmath2 and two - meson sectors .",
    "thus , we shall employ here the model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 and @xmath23 states , and generalized to other flavors in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the relative couplings are determined with the formalism from ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is assumed that each decay product takes over one of the original constituent quarks .",
    "other processes are here classified as ozi forbidden .",
    ".the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar , pseudoscalar - vector , vector - vector , and scalar - vector real and virtual ozi - allowed two - meson channels , for @xmath24 , 1 , 2 , 3 , considered throughout this work , their thresholds , and relative couplings squared to each of the two @xmath2 channels . for @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "we assume flavor octet and singlet , respectively .",
    "experimental masses are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the @xmath27(2308 ) @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the @xmath28(800 ) ( or @xmath29 ) @xcite . for the latter resonance",
    ", we choose the peak mass of 830 mev from ref .",
    "@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     so what exactly can be found in experiment , is not entirely clear from our predictions .",
    "we only assure that narrow companions to the @xmath4 should exist .",
    "their positions are predicted here within the model error of some 50 mev . the broader resonance at 3.03 gev , with a width of 5060 mev , should be reasonably easy to observe experimentally .",
    "the experimental confirmation of at least some of the here predicted signals will contribute strongly to our understanding of the @xmath2 spectrum .",
