    "the percolation model is well - known for its ability to describe a phase transition between an insulating and a conducting phase and has already been used to describe insulator - conductor transitions in electrolytes , two - component conductors , binary glasses and more ( for an overview see e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", it was proposed that a disordered system of sintered nanocrystalline semiconducting n - grains should act as a gas sensor @xcite , i.e. switch from the insulating to the conducting phase in response to a reducing gas .",
    "the mechanism based on the percolation effect is the following : in normal air , according to a standard model @xcite , oxygen adsorbs at the grain surface and traps mobile electrons ( see fig .  [",
    "bi : grains](a ) ) , so that smaller grains are insulating .",
    "when the oxygen coverage is reduced by a reaction of the oxygene with a reducing gas , more and more grains become conducting until the concentrations of conducting grains and bonds both exceed the so - called critical concentrations @xcite .",
    "then , the resistance @xmath0 of the system jumps to a much smaller order of magnitude allowing for the detection of the gas .",
    "( for an overview of percolation effects in gas sensors see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this transition alone delivers no information on the type of the reducing gas .",
    "the ability of a sensor to answer differently to different gases is named  selectivity  and is  even if highly desirable  difficult to achieve @xcite .",
    "one approach is to compose a sensor of two types of grains , one of them decreasing and the other one increasing @xmath0 with increasing gas concentration , as e.g. semiconducting n- and p - grains @xcite .",
    "such a composite system should be able to respond with a resistance increase as well as with a decrease to the gas exposure and even a mutual neutralisation of both effects is conceivable .",
    "the challange is to find one specific system that can show both , increase and decrease of @xmath0 , depending on the gas .",
    "experimentally , such a behavior has been reported on systems of sintered @xmath1 grains in the two representations anatase and rutile @xcite that have been reported as n- and p - semiconductors , respectively .",
    "a sample with a volume ratio 1:3 of n - anatase to p - rutile was found to show ( nearly ) no response to @xmath2 but react with a resistance decrease to @xmath3 .",
    "percolation effects have been assumed responsible for this interesting behavior .",

    "similar to the observations of @xcite i show that certain composite systems can show no reaction or even an increase of @xmath0 to a gas a and a decrease of @xmath0 to another gas b. however , contrary to the assumptions of @xcite , i show that bonds between n- and p - grains play a major role for a selective behavior as they couple the two types of pathes .",
    "both types of grains are modelled in reasonable approximations under the influence of adsorbed oxygen , thereby applying basic microscopical concepts @xcite .",
    "different gases are distinguished by their reaction rates with the adsorbed oxygen , expressed by appropriate ",

    "all grains are now conducting ( in contrast to the works of @xcite ) , i.e. the n - grains are not too small .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the microscopical picture of the single grains is explained , while section iii describes how the grains are organized in networks and how the resistances are computed .",

    "one gets the surface density of the ( initially ) adsorbed oxygen by the condition of  charge neutrality  as @xmath15 .",
    "when a reducing gas as e.g. @xmath3 is offered , according to a standard model @xcite , it reacts with part of the adsorbed oxygen according to @xmath16 and releases the electrons back to the bulk , so that the negative surface charge is reduced .",
    "now , the charge neutrality delivers @xmath17 as a function of the surface density @xmath18 of the reducing gas , @xmath19 the reaction factor @xmath4 is related to the equilibrium rate of the reaction between oxygen and reducing gas and describes the fraction of gas that reacts with the adsorbed oxygen . a simpler version of eq .",

    "are compared here , i apply the more realistic assumption that @xmath21 . clearly , @xmath4 differs from the respective reaction factor on p - grains .",
    "also the p - grains can be described by a positively charged shell and a neutral core @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ bi : grains](b ) ) , where the volume density of positive holes in the core equals the acceptor density @xmath22 .",
    "when oxygen adsorbs at the surface of p - grains , it traps electrons from the valence band thereby creating additional holes",

    "contrary to the value of @xmath9 ( on n - grains ) that is simply set to zero , the mean density @xmath23 of mobile holes in the accumulation layer must also be determined .",

    "@xmath52 can be estimated in complete analogy to ( [ lambdan ] ) as @xmath53 where @xmath5 describes the reaction rate between the reducing gas and the oxygen on the surface of p - grains .",
    "we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ lambdan ] ) and ( [ lambdap ] ) that the thicknesses of the shells are largest , when the grain surfaces are covered solely by adsorbed oxygen , i.e. when @xmath54 .",
    "the mapping of a complicated composite system onto a percolation problem has been discussed for several decades @xcite . in a general system of overlapping conducting particles inside a matrix of lower conductance",
    ", different types of contacts between particles may occur .",
    "a model example is the  checkerboard  , i.e. a 2d or 3d system of squares or cubes of different materials that touch each other by nearest - neighbor contacts ( via the borders ) and by next - nearest neighbor point contacts via the corners ( where pathes around the edges through neighboring units may be involved @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown since long that percolation thresholds and exponents of these systems differ from the ones of the corresponding properties of percolating networks , where the squares ( or cubes ) have been replaced by discrete sites connected by bonds and that the corner contacts between next - nearest neighbors may even lead to a second percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "different  mixing rules  telling us , in which geometrical shapes and with which connections disordered heterogeneous media should be mapped onto lattices have been established @xcite and tested by comparing the numerical solutions of different physical properties , as e.g. conductance or admittance gained on discretized lattices to the exact solutions @xcite . however , while checkerboard problems can be solved analytically and numerically by discretizing the systems @xcite , for the majority of systems , clear mixing rules are not available @xcite .    in the systems of this work , n- and p - grains with similar conductances are sintered together .",
    "we consider well - sintered grains , where the electron hopping across grain - boundaries can be neglected @xcite , especially when the grain surfaces are rough @xcite .",
    "conductance over next - nearest neigbors by a direct ( small ) overlap or a point contact is in principle possible if both next - nearest neighbors are big enough , but for the system parameters chosen here the contribution to the conductance can be considered as much smaller than conductance over nearest neighbors ( see below for the sintering parameter @xmath55 ) .    here , it is not our aim to reproduce the exact resistance of a given system , but to understand the qualitative behavior , namely if percolation effects are able to influence the reaction of such systems towards _ different gases _ in a way that the _ same _ system can show increasing , decreasing or constant resistance as a function of the surface gas density .",
    "therefore , we consider the relative resistance @xmath56 , i.e. the ratio between the resistances with and without gas , so that all specific material properties that vary only slowly with @xmath18 cancel out . the model system has been maintained simple : the resistances have been calculated by random walk simulations @xcite on a disordered cubic lattice , where the sites represent simplified n- or p - grains , bonds between nearest - neighbor sites have been estimated from the area of the conducting overlap between them and next - nearest neighbor contacts have been neglected . to this end , the nanogranular films are mapped onto a simple cubic network of size @xmath57 and lattice constant @xmath58 , consisting of sites and bonds between the sites .",

    "it turned out that despite several simplifications , the overall agreement with former experimental results is very good and the percolation model can explain in which way a system can distinguish between different gases , namely by the development of percolating pathways of n- and p - grains that react in different ways to the gas . the observed selective behavior of the systems can be attributed to the different responses of the space charge layers ( shells ) of the n- and the p - grains that can in principle be adjusted by the proper choice of the semiconducting materials and by an appropriate doping . in this context , it is of special interest that the np - bonds are necessary to reproduce the experimental curves .",
    "as the np - bonds provide the link between n- and p - paths , the neglection of them leads to a decoupling of both paths , leading to a less selective picture .",
    "clearly , several simplifications have been applied in order to keep the numerical effort feasable : first , the gas concentration @xmath18 used in this work is a surface concentration , while in the experimental curve of @xcite , volume gas densities have been applied .",
    "the surface gas density normally depends on the volume density in a non - linear way , which influences the shape of the curves .",
    "second , the systems have been discretized on a lattice , a procedure that is under discussion since long and it is not clear which kind of  mixing rules  are best suited for the present problem .",
    "the discretization , therefore , is a further simplification with the main aim to keep the parameters simple and clear .",
    "for the same reason , also the systems have been standardized : instead of the different experimental shapes and sizes for the n- and the p - grains , all grains have been assumed as spherical with the same medium size of n- and p - grains .",
    "conductancies over next - nearest neighbors have been neglected , while in reality a multitude of paths between adjacent grains ( including paths over edges and corners ) may come into play .",
    "the conductances over the bonds have been estimated in a simplified way , without including e.g. different mobilities of electrons and holes .",
    "therefore , i have estimated the influence of these various factors on the global qualitative behavior by testing a lot of different values for particle sizes , occupation probabilities , width of the disorder and others . as shown in the figures ,",
    "these differences are only important for the value of @xmath124 , but play nearly no role for the change of @xmath0 with @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the basic challenge to find out by which mechanisms percolation effects can lead to a selective behavior of a gas sensor composed of n- and p - grains has been answered by introducing the appropriate reaction factors @xmath4 and @xmath5 that describe the number of gas molecules that react with the adsorbed oxygene .",
    "this mechanism is quite simple , the results are extremely stable against all kind of parameter changes other than either the strengths of the np - bonds or @xmath4 and @xmath5 themselves .",
    "future work on more realistic continuous systems is of course highly desirable in order to optimize the performance of the sensors .",

    "<S> it is shown that a two - component percolation model on a simple cubic lattice can explain an experimentally observed behavior @xcite , namely that a network built up by a mixture of sintered nanocrystalline semiconducting n- and p - grains can exhibit selective behavior , i.e. respond with a resistance increase when exposed to a reducing gas a and with a resistance decrease in response to another reducing gas b. to this end , a simple model is developed , where the n- and p - grains are simulated by overlapping spheres , based on realistic assumptions about the gas reactions on the grain surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance is calculated by random walk simulations with nn- , pp- and np - bonds between the grains and the results are found in very good agreement with the experiments . </S>",
