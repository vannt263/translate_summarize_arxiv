    "how did elliptical galaxies form and evolve ?",
    "there are two mechanisms that have been proposed .",
    "first is the monolithic collapse model , in which elliptical galaxies form at high redshifts in an intense burst of star formation @xcite .",
    "essentially all the final mass of the galaxy is already present within its potential well at the time of formation .",
    "the second mechanism is the merger model , in which ellipticals form at relatively lower redshifts from the merger of many smaller galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "the mass of the galaxy increases with time as more and more smaller galaxies are canibalized by the forming elliptical .",
    "recent observations suggest that both mechanisms may have a role to play .",
    "for example , @xcite found that spheroidal galaxies in clusters at @xmath17 required a formation redshift ( by which we mean the redshift at which the dominant stellar population formed ) of @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that the small number of very red galaxies in deep optical / infrared surveys suggested either that ellipticals form at moderate redshifts ( and are enshrouded by dust ) , or that they assemble through the merging of smaller galaxies .",
    "similarly @xcite identified a group of lyman-@xmath19 emitters at @xmath20 that they suggested may subsequently merge at a lower redshift into one or more luminous galaxies .",
    "@xcite concluded from their study of nicmos parallel fields that a significant fraction ( 1066% ) of the elliptical galaxy population formed at @xmath18 , but the rest may have been formed ( or at least assembled ) at lower redshifts .    one important method of studying high - redshift ( @xmath21 ) ellipticals is via radio selection . at low redshifts , luminous radio sources",
    "are almost exclusively hosted by giant elliptical galaxies containing old stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to the extent that radio galaxies at high redshifts are also hosted by giant ellipticals , they can be used to study the evolution of the elliptical galaxy population .",
    "@xcite obtained infrared @xmath22 magnitudes for a subsample of the 3cr radio survey , from which they constructed a @xmath22-band hubble diagram .",
    "they concluded from this @xmath22@xmath23 relation that luminous radio galaxies at @xmath24 are giant ellipticals with passively - evolving stellar populations . @xcite and @xcite found that the @xmath22@xmath23 relation for less - powerful radio galaxies led to a similar conclusion .    at redshifts",
    "@xmath25 , @xcite found that the 6c radio galaxies , with radio luminosities a factor of @xmath26 lower than the 3cr , were also on average 0.6  mag fainter than 3cr in the @xmath22-band .",
    "@xcite investigated the @xmath27-band morphologies of ten of these 6c sources at @xmath28 , showing that seven of them were normal ellipticals and the other three were ongoing or recent mergers .",
    "the radii of the 6c galaxies were significantly smaller than those of the 3cr sources at similar redshifts @xcite , indicating that their fainter @xmath22 magnitudes were due to their smaller size , not solely due to the difference in power of their agn .",
    "the leiden - berkeley deep survey ( lbds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a flux density limit of 1  mjy at 1.4  ghz , is sensitive to radio sources a factor of @xmath29 fainter than the 6c survey , thus probing lower radio luminosities and higher redshifts .",
    "@xcite showed that the radio galaxy lbds 53w002 has a weak agn and a dominant @xmath2 profile with the colours of a @xmath30  year young stellar population at @xmath20 , suggesting that these weak radio sources could have formed rather mature ellipticals at high redshifts .",
    "two more of these sources have proved particularly useful for the study of galaxy evolution , due to the deep spectra that we obtained with the keck telescope .",
    "lbds 53w091 has a redshift of 1.552 , and its restframe uv spectrum is best modeled by a stellar population @xmath31  gyr old @xcite .",
    "lbds 53w069 is at @xmath32 and has a best - fitting stellar population of age @xmath33  gyr @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the age determination in detail and showed how the minimum age of the universe at @xmath1 , as required by the age of 53w091 , placed limits on the allowed values of the cosmological parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xcite similarly showed that the age inferred from the keck spectrum of the radio galaxy 3c65 ( @xmath37  gyr at @xmath38 ) required a formation redshift of @xmath39 .",
    "several authors have questioned the reliability of these age estimates , for example @xcite and @xcite derive ages of 1.52  gyr for 53w091 .",
    "however , @xcite argued that such young ages are only deduced if the near - infrared photometry is included in the model fitting ; if the fitting is confined to the spectroscopic data then a variety of stellar population sythesis codes consistently produce ages of @xmath40  gyr ( see also nolan et  al.2001b ) . we will not discuss this age controversy further here , but simply note that nothing in the current paper depends crucially on the precise ages of these sources .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the morphologies of these two radio galaxies with the _ hubble space telescope s ( hst ) _ wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos ) . at @xmath1 ,",

    "therefore the results of this section alone do not exclude the possibility of some star formation in the lbds galaxies ; indeed the disk component identified in 53w091 ( section 3 ) may be the site of recent low - level star formation activity .",
    "we have shown above that the two @xmath1 lbds radio galaxies 53w069 & 53w091 are significantly smaller than the average 3cr galaxy at @xmath13 ( section 4.1 ) . in this section , we consider whether their smaller size could also explain their lower radio luminosity .",
    "we recall how both size and radio power scale with the mass of the galaxy and its central black hole , and then estimate of the masses of these two radio galaxies .",
    "the correlation between the central black hole mass ( @xmath85 ) and the spheroid mass ( @xmath86 ) of galaxies is now well - established @xcite : @xmath87 for spirals , @xmath86 is the mass of the bulge ( spheroid ) component ( i.e.  excluding the disk ) , for ellipticals it is the total ( virial ) mass of the galaxy .",
    "further investigations have also revealed correlations between @xmath85 and spheroid luminosity ( @xmath88 ) and between @xmath85 and stellar velocity dispersion @xcite . in the absence of velocity dispersion data we adopt the well - known relation between galaxy mass and luminosity , using the mass - to - light ratio for elliptical galaxies from @xcite : @xmath89 for a de vaucouleurs @xmath2 law , the integrated galaxy luminosity is given by @xmath90 where the intensity at the effective radius ( @xmath91 ) is trivially related to the effective surface brightness @xmath92 .",
    "we adopt a kormendy relation with a slope of 3 , @xmath93 , this being consistent with the 3cr results of @xcite , the cluster relation found in section 4.2 above and the @xmath66 agn sample of @xcite . combining these equations",
    "thus gives a scaling relation between the effective radius and the spheroid mass of elliptical galaxies : @xmath94 the error in the index is due to errors in the @xmath86@xmath88 correlation ( e.g.  @xcite find @xmath95 , c.f .",
    "equations 1 & 2 ) and the slope of the kormendy relation ( @xmath62 , see values in section 4 ) .",
    "the combination of these errors leads to an error in the power - law index of no more than @xmath62 .",
    "whatever the physical mechanism that drives the radio output of agn , and indeed non - active spheroids , a number of authors have found a power - law dependence between radio power ( @xmath96 ) and black hole mass : @xmath97 where we have used the magorrian relation ( equation 1 ) in the second step .",
    "@xcite find a best - fitting value of @xmath98 for a sample of nearby galaxies , whose black hole masses are based directly on stellar dynamics .",
    "they note that @xmath99 is a generic prediction of any emission process that depends on the emitting area around a black hole , and in particular @xmath100 is the prediction of advection - dominated accretion flows ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite demonstrated that with @xmath102 , equation 4 is consistent with both ( i ) normal galaxies and radio - quiet quasars , and ( ii ) radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , but with a normalization that differs between the two classes of radio power .",
    "if equations 3 & 4 are combined , we get a scaling relation between the radio power and effective radius of radio - loud ellipticals : @xmath103 where we have used @xmath104 from @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties in @xmath105 this can only be considered an approximate relation , but it is still interesting to compare the two lbds galaxies with the more powerful 3cr sources at @xmath13 .",
    "we converted the observed 8.4  ghz flux densities of the ten 3cr sources @xcite to emitted 1.4  ghz luminosites using a mean spectral index of @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 ) .",
    "their mean power is then @xmath108  w  hz@xmath45 in our cosmology .",
    "we similarly calculated the 1.4  ghz luminosites of 53w069 & 53w091 ( with spectral indices of 0.9 & 1.1 respectively ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , giving @xmath109  w  hz@xmath45 . given these radio powers , and recalling that the mean effective radius of the 3cr sources is 12  kpc ( section 4.1 ) , the scaling relation ( equation 4 ) would predict the sizes of the lbds galaxies to be 4  kpc .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with their actual effective radii of 3  kpc .",
    "the smaller size and lower radio luminosity of these galaxies compared with 3cr is consistent with them being less - massive galaxies with proportionately less - massive black holes ; their smaller size can not be taken as evidence of evolution in the size of the largest ellipticals .",
    "we estimated the virial masses of 53w069 & 53w091 as follows .",
    "although we do not know the velocity dispersions , we can estimate them from the zero - redshift fundamental plane relation @xcite . using the effective radius and present - day @xmath52-band surface brightness of each galaxy derived in section  4 ( @xmath110 for 53w069 & 20.0 for 53w091 ) , we predict a velocity dispersion of @xmath111  km  s@xmath45 for the lbds galaxies .",
    "the present - day absolute @xmath52-band magnitudes ( vega system ) were similarly calculated from the observed f110w magnitudes and the corrections of section 4 .",

    "<S> compared with the sample of cluster ellipticals , 53w069 & 53w091 lie well within the scatter of the kormendy relation . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the hosts of these millijansky radio sources at @xmath15 are passively - evolving elliptical galaxies that will evolve into ordinary @xmath16 ellipticals by the present day .    </S>",
