    "the renormalization group equation ( rge ) has long proven useful as a means of improving and extending results obtained from perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "in addition to giving rise to scale - dependent running parameters ( coupling constants and masses ) and concomitant scale properties ( _ e.g. _ asymptotic freedom ) , the rge can also be utilised to determine scale - dependent portions of higher - order contributions to perturbative expressions .",
    "for example , if the two - loop contribution to a physical process has been determined via explicit computation of pertinent feynman diagrams , the rge then determines all leading - log and next - to - leading contributions to _ all _ subsequent orders of perturbation theory .",
    "we denote such logarithms to be `` rg - accessible . '' in the present paper we demonstrate how closed - form summation of such rg - accessible logarithm contributions is obtained for a number of physical processes whose field - theoretical series are known to two or more nonleading orders of perturbation theory .",
    "consider a perturbative series of the form @xmath7 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^n s_n\\left[xl\\right ] = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\sum_{k=0}^n t_{n , k } x^n l^k \\tlabel{pert_series}\\ ] ] occurring within a physical decay rate @xmath8 or measurable cross - section @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the running coupling constant ( for qcd @xmath11 ) and where @xmath12 is a logarithm regulated by the renormalization mass scale @xmath5 that may or may not also depend on a running mass : @xmath13 if @xmath14 is a running mass , then @xmath15   =   -m [ \\gamma_0 x + \\gamma_1 x^2 + \\gamma_2 x^3 + ... ] \\tlabel{mass_rg}\\ ] ] if @xmath14 is a pole mass ( or for scattering processes , a kinematic variable ) , then @xmath16 as defined by is zero .    for example , in the fully @xmath4 expression for the semileptonic @xmath17 rate obtained from five active flavours , @xmath14 is the running mass @xmath18 , @xmath19 ^ 5 s[x(\\mu ) , l(\\mu ) ] \\tlabel{decay_def}\\ ] ] and the successive - order series coefficients within @xmath20 $ ] , as defined by , are @xcite @xmath21 the five active - flavour pole - mass expression for the same rate is obtained by replacing @xmath22 with the renormalization - scale independent pole mass @xmath23 in and , as well as a concomitant alteration of the following series coefficients @xcite @xmath24    suppose for a given scattering or decay process that the series @xmath20 $ ] is known to some order of perturbation theory : @xmath25 these next - to - leading ( nl ) and higher - order expressions exhibit scale dependence as the magnitude of @xmath26 increases . however , higher order polynomial coefficients of @xmath26 can be determined via an appropriate rge .",
    "for example , in @xmath27 the application of the rge to the known @xcite two - loop ( nnl ) @xmath4 expression for the rate is sufficient to determine the three - loop coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 : for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 @xcite .",

    "although rge determinations of higher - order terms have been known for some time to be of value in extracting divergent parts of bare parameters @xcite , the principle of incorporating _ all _ higher - order rg - accessible terms available to a given feynman - diagram order of perturbation theory was , to the best of our knowledge , first articulated by maxwell @xcite as a method for eliminating unphysical renormalization - scale dependence .",
    "the all - orders summation of leading logarithms has been subsequently applied by maxwell and mirjalili @xcite to moments of qcd leptoproduction structure functions and to @xmath48-order correlation functions .",

    "such summations enable one to construct @xmath47 perturbative expressions inclusive of up - to - three nonleading logarithmic contributions to all orders of the perturbative series .    in section [ bu_ms_sec ] , these results are applied to the @xmath52 rate computed to nnl order by van ritbergen @xcite , later extended via pad - approximant methods to a subsequent @xmath53 prediction @xcite .",
    "the renormalization - scale dependence of the unsummed perturbative rate truncated to a given order is shown to be much greater than that of the @xmath47 rates obtained from the same perturbative expression .    in section [ bu_pole_sec ] ,",
    "@xmath47 expressions are obtained for the decays @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the `` pole mass '' scheme in which only the couplant @xmath56 exhibits renormalization - scale dependence .",
    "this scheme , already known to have difficulties for the @xmath57 case @xcite , exhibits a rate which increases with the renormalization scale @xmath5 , making the identification of a `` correct '' or optimal value of @xmath5 problematical .",
    "however , rg - summation is shown effectively to remove such @xmath5-dependence , leading to reliable order - by - order pole - mass - scheme predictions for the @xmath57 semileptonic rate consistent with the @xmath57 rate obtained from an @xmath4-scheme inclusive of a running b - quark mass .",
    "@xmath47-expressions are also obtained for the @xmath58 semileptonic rate based upon its ( approximately- ) known @xmath48 series @xcite and its pad - estimated @xmath53 series in the pole - mass scheme @xcite .",
    "the rge appropriate for the perturbative series for semileptonic b - decays in the pole mass scheme is also the appropriate rge for the fermionic vector - current correlation function utilised to obtain qcd corrections to the cross - section ratio @xmath59 . in section [ vec_corr_sec ]",
    "we obtain rg - summation expressions for the qcd series embedded within the vector - current correlation function that include all higher - order logarithmic contributions that are accessible from the three fully - known nonleading orders of perturbative corrections in the @xmath4 scheme .",
    "we are thus able to compare directly the renormalization - scale dependence of the unsummed series @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 to their corresponding @xmath47 expressions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "we find that the latter expressions provide a set of virtually scale - independent order - by - order perturbative predictions for the vector correlator .    in section [ pert_sec ] ,",
    "we show how the use of process - appropriate rge s can be used to obtain @xmath47 perturbative expressions for a number of other processes .",

    "we also discuss how rg - summation of the two scalar - current correlators considered in section [ pert_sec ] removes much of the unphysical @xmath5-dependence of the unsummed series at low s that would otherwise percolate through qcd sum - rule integrals sensitive to the low - s region .",

    "these results indicate that even @xmath53-order expressions for the perturbative contribution to qcd correlation functions exhibit substantial @xmath5-dependence",

    "the @xmath5-independence of rg - summation , particularly for the vector - current correlation function ( section [ vec_corr_sec ] ) , is seen to justify the prescription of zeroing all logarithms by setting the renormalization scale to @xmath329 equal to the kinematic variable @xmath67 .",
    "this prescription necessarily equates the unsummed and rg - summed series , and , since the rg - summed series is virtually independent of @xmath5 , the zeroing of logarithms in the unsummed series equilibrates it to the flat rg - summation level we obtain .    in section [ pert_sec ] , rg - summation",
    "is also applied to the perturbative contributions to the momentum - space qcd static potential , the decay - rate of a standard - model higgs to two gluons , the higgs - mediated cross - section @xmath478 , and to two scalar - current correlation functions .",
