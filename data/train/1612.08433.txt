    "in an optically inactive ( achiral ) isotropic medium , a weak linearly polarized light pulse preserves its polarization state as it propagates .",
    "however , even in such media , nonlinear interaction with a strong circularly polarized laser beam may rotate the polarization plane of the probe pulse , which is known as the _ optical faraday effect _  @xcite . similarly to the faraday effect and differently from optical activity in chiral media , the rotation angle @xmath2 changes its sign if the propagation direction of the probe pulse is reversed .",

    "the induced optical faraday effect is probed by a linearly polarized ultraviolet ( uv ) pulse that is significantly shorter than the pump pulse , but not necessarily shorter than a single ir optical cycle .",

    "presenting our results , we first show how the optical faraday effect depends on the strength of the ir field .",
    "the red curve in fig .  [ fig : field_scaling ] illustrates the @xmath41 scaling in the weak - field limit , a range of laser fields where deviations from this scaling law become visible ( above 0.1  v /  ) , and typical values of the polarization rotation per unit propagation length .",
    "there results were obtained for pump and probe pulses arriving simultaneously ( @xmath42 ) . for a peak ir intensity of @xmath43 , the induced optical faraday rotation at the central uv frequency is @xmath44 radians ( @xmath45 ) per micrometer .",
    "note that reaching this rotation strength in the conventional faraday effect would require a magnetic field as strong as 700 tesla , which exceeds the strongest nondestructive magnetic fields currently available in laboratories .",
    "in addition to polarization rotation , the uv pulse also experiences ir - pulse - induced circular dichroism , shown by the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_scaling ] . in the weak - field limit ,",
    "the induced ellipticity per unit propagation length scales as @xmath46 , indicating that at least three ir photons must be absorbed in addition to a uv photon to overcome the band gap . at @xmath47",
    "v /  , the induced zero - delay ellipticity changes its sign , which looks like a narrow downward spike on the logarithmic scale .",
    "altogether , @xmath46 changes its sign four times in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_scaling ] .        to clarify the origin of the induced chirality , we first review the relevant wave mixing processes within the standard framework of nonlinear optics , where the nonlinear polarization response in the vicinity of a frequency @xmath48 is described by the third - order susceptibility tensor @xmath49 . as long as the polarization response is linear with respect to the probe field ,",
    "the optical faraday effect is best understood by decomposing the linearly polarized uv pulse into its circularly polarized components : @xmath50 with @xmath51 . in the case @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 .",
    "the pump pulse rotates the polarization plane of the probe pulse if it has different effects on its left- and right - rotating components . if there is a process that induces different absorption for the two components , circular dichroism is observed .",
    "wave mixing processes that involve one uv photon and two ir photons also produce light at frequencies @xmath54 . in a homogeneous isotropic medium ,",
    "the spin angular momentum of a photon , @xmath55 , is conserved . from this principle ,",
    "the following selection rules for third - order processes follow : ( i ) a circularly polarized ir field can not generate the third - harmonic ; ( ii ) both circularly polarized components of the uv pulse induce circularly polarized @xmath56 , which rotates in the same direction as the uv field ; ( in other words , absorbing and emitting an ir photon as a part of wave mixing does not change the spin angular momentum of the uv light ) ; ( ii ) a circularly polarized component of the uv pulse induces a circularly polarized @xmath56 rotating in the same direction as the uv field ; ( in other words , absorbing and emitting an ir photon as a part of wave mixing does not change the spin angular momentum of the uv light ) ; ( iii ) in the case of co - rotating ir and uv fields , emission at @xmath57 is forbidden due to @xmath58 , while @xmath59 rotates in the direction opposite to that of the light fields ; ( iv ) in the case of counter - rotating ir and uv fields , emission at @xmath60 is forbidden , while @xmath61 rotates in the same direction as the ir field .",
    "we found that the same rules apply to the @xmath62 crystal system of sapphire if the laser beam is aligned with its threefold rotation - inversion axis ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "this is a nontrivial fact : for example , third - harmonic generation with circularly polarized light is allowed in cubic crystals , where the linear response is also isotropic .",
    "if the wave mixing channels are spectrally separated , effective susceptibilities , @xmath63 , describe the propagation of circularly polarized light at @xmath64 . for an ir field rotating counter - clockwise ,",

    "the former susceptibility describes the process where an @xmath38-polarized ir photon is absorbed and a @xmath70-polarized photon is emitted ( in addition to absorbing a uv photon ) , while the second one describes the opposite process .",
    "the two susceptibilities would be equal if the polarization response were instantaneous , in which case they would satisfy kleinman s symmetry .",
    "therefore , the optical faraday effect is a consequence of the nonlinear polarization response being non - instantaneous .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     since the optical faraday effect results from the nonlinear medium response being noninstantaneous , these effects lend themselves to pump - probe measurements . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_scan](a ) , we show the delay dependence of the polarization rotation evaluated at the central uv frequency .",
    "positive delays here mean that the probe pulse arrives after the pump pulse . at @xmath71",
    "v /  , the conventional perturbative nonlinear optics works well ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : field_scaling ] ) , so we expect @xmath41 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that @xmath72 as a function of the delay ( blue curve ) has precisely the same shape as the convolution @xmath73 ( red dashed curve ) .",
    "when we increase @xmath74 to 1  v /  , we observe a small but significant reshaping of @xmath72 , revealing the onset of nonadiabatic processes that disappear by the end of the pulse .",
    "our analysis of the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarization_spectra ] , as well as the observation that reshaping is stronger at positive delays , suggest that these effects are probably related to the creation of real ( nonvirtual ) electronic excitations and angular momentum transfer from photons to charge carriers . for 1  v /  ,",
    "the residual excitation density is @xmath75 electrons per unit cell .",
    "we also note that the dynamical franz - keldysh effect becomes an important excitation mechanism at such field strengths ; nonadiabatic features of this effect have recently been predicted in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the nonadiabatic effects manifest themselves more vividly in the delay dependence of the induced ellipticity of the uv pulse . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_scan](b ) , we show @xmath76 evaluated with the aid of eq .  .",
    "when the ir field is weak ( 0.1  v /  ) , the induced ellipticity is mainly due to the time - dependent polarization rotation  the intensity of the 5-fs ir pulse changes significantly during the 2.5-fs uv pulse , and so does @xmath72 .",
    "this contribution to the induced ellipticity is particularly large at delays where @xmath77 is large . at the same time",
    ", even this relatively weak ir field induces some noticeable ellipticity at @xmath42 , where @xmath78 , and , therefore , the main mechanism is the induced circular dichroism .",
    "this contribution , which implies helicity - dependent absorption , has a qualitatively different delay dependence : it does not change sign at @xmath42 .",
    "the sum of the two functions , one of which is approximately odd and the other one is approximately even , results in the asymmetric shape of the blue curve . at @xmath79",
    "v /  ( green curve ) , the induced ellipticity exhibits a complex , oscillatory dependence on the pump - probe delay , where the oscillation period is close to the optical period of the ir field ( 2.5  fs ) . even in this regime ,",
    "the induced ellipticity is only present when the pump and probe pulses overlap .",
    "we conclude this paper with a brief discussion of the role played by physical symmetries . we have considered the case where the polarization response to the probe pulse alone ( without the strong field ) is invariant with respect to parity and time - reversal symmetries . a strong adiabatic ( i.e. , with frequency within the band gap )",
    "circularly - polarized optical field transiently relaxes both these symmetries . in analogy to the conventional faraday effect , imposing time reversal on the crystal and the applied ( strong ) field reverses the polarization rotation of the probe pulse .",
    "however , in contrast to the conventional faraday effect , the time reversal symmetry is relaxed not due to the interaction with magnetic field but due to the noninstantaneous nonlinear polarization response .",
    "importantly , the response time appears to be so small that the optical faraday effect in solids is inertialess for any practical purposes .",
    "indeed , the time span of the pump - probe delay dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_scan ] is the same as the duration of the pump pulse even if , within the pulse , the excitation of electrons to conduction bands changes the shapes of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this absence of residual chirality is qualitatively different from the effect of excitations on the optical faraday effect in atoms .",
    "possibly , averaging over crystal momenta in eq .   leads to effective collisionless dephasing ( landau damping ) that counteracts excitation - induced chirality . for basic research",
    ", the optical faraday effect may be important as a spectroscopic tool for studying strong - field phenomena with an attosecond temporal resolution .",
