    "the spectacular experimental realization of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) using cold atoms in an optical lattice @xcite triggered an avalanche of both theoretical and experimental activity @xcite .",
    "the excitement comes mostly from the fact that the derivation of the bhm in this system can be carried out rigorously @xcite , its parameters can be experimentally manipulated in real time @xcite , and lattice geometry can be engineered almost at will : it can be one , two , three dimensional , and can have different shapes , e.g. , rectangular , triangular , etc .",
    "physics of the bose - hubbard model is of both fundamental and practical interest .",
    "indeed , the bhm is one of the model systems on which our understanding of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is based @xcite .",
    "the quantum phase transition happens in the bhm between the gapless superfluid ( sf ) phase and the gapped mott insulator ( mi ) phase .",
    "recently its signatures have been experimentally observed @xcite . in a homogeneous system at fixed density",
    ", the transition takes place only when the number of atoms is commensurate with the number of lattice sites .",
    "the practical interest in the bhm originates from the possibility of realization of a quantum computer in a system of cold atoms placed in an optical lattice @xcite .    in spite of experimental studies of the bhm and",
    "the large number of numerical and analytical contributions , understanding of the bhm physics is far from complete .",
    "in particular , a theory of the dynamics of the mi - sf quantum phase transition is still in its initial stages @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , as until very recently @xcite , qpts have been studied as a purely equilibrium problem .",
    "the recent progress in dynamical studies has been obtained after applying the kibble - zurek mechanism ( kzm ) @xcite , which was successful in accounting for non - equilibrium aspects of thermodynamical phase transitions @xcite , to the quantum case @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the one dimensional ( 1d ) bhm , focusing on two - point correlation functions . to describe their time dependence , we develop and use a variety of analytical approximations .",
    "we find that the two - point correlations satisfy simple characteristic scaling relations that should be experimentally measurable .",
    "finally , we check the accuracy of our predictions with numerical simulations .",
    "section [ model ] presents the model and defines the quantities of interest . in section [ two ]",
    "we discuss predictions coming from a toy two - site model .",
    "section [ fast ] ( [ slow ] ) analyzes scaling relations of correlation functions induced by fast ( slow ) changes of the tunneling coupling .",
    "in terms of dimensionless variables used throughout this paper , the hamiltonian reads @xmath0 where we additionally assume a density of one particle per site .",
    "such a model should be experimentally accessible in a ring - shaped optical lattice @xcite , where the geometry of the problem imposes periodic boundary conditions on ( [ h ] ) .",
    "another setup for investigations of the bose - hubbard model ( [ h ] ) will be provided by the ongoing experiment in the raizen group @xcite , where a 1d homogeneous model with open boundary conditions will be realized .",
    "below , we will assume periodic boundary conditions for the sake of convenience , but in a realistic experimental situation with a few tens of lattice sites the dynamics should be unaffected by the boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian is driven from the mi to the sf regime by a linear ramp of the tunneling coupling j(t)= , [ jt ] where @xmath1 is the quench time - scale @xcite .",
    "the evolution starts at @xmath2 from the ground state of ( [ h ] ) , i.e. , @xmath3 , where the numbers denote boson on - site occupations .",
    "the evolution stops at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the system ends up very far away from the critical point separating mi and sf phases : @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the change of the tunneling coupling alone can be achieved by proper manipulation of the lattice potential amplitude , followed by adjustment of the atomic interaction strength via feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the correlation functions : @xmath7 which are directly experimentally measurable because momentum distribution of atoms in a lattice is their fourier transform @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the atomic momentum ) @xcite .",
    "this observation shows that the correlation functions are good observables for our problem : by the end of time evolution @xmath10 so that interactions between atoms are asymptotically negligible . as a result ,",
    "the correlation functions take well defined final values .",
    "in this section we consider a toy @xmath11-site model , a problem that can be completely solved analytically .",
    "the results of this section will be useful later for studies of larger systems . using symmetries of the hamiltonian",
    ", one can show that the evolution starting from the uniform `` mott '' state @xmath12 leads to @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 a change of basis @xmath16 yields @xmath17 this is exactly the landau - zener ( lz ) model @xcite , whose relevance for dynamics of qpts was recently shown in refs .",
    "the quantity of interest is @xmath18where @xmath19 is provided by the exact solution of the landau - zener model in the case when the system starts its time evolution from the ground state at @xmath2 , i.e. , from the anti - crossing center @xcite .",
    "this solution is a superposition of weber functions ( see appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and it leads to @xmath20 which has the following small @xmath1 ( fast quench ) expansion @xmath21 for large @xmath1 ( slow quench ) , we expand the gamma functions for large absolute values of the argument @xcite , ( z)= z^z - e^z ( 1 + + + o(z^-3 ) ) , and use that @xmath22 to obtain c_1()= 1- + o(_q^-4 ) . [ infty ] eq . ( [ infty ] ) is surprising since @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the excitation probability of the lz system ( [ lztau ] ) at @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , it implies that the excitation probability equals @xmath26 when the lz system ( [ lztau ] ) starts evolution from anticrossing center ( @xmath2 ) and evolves slowly till @xmath25 , while it is _ exponentially _ small ( assuming @xmath27 ) @xmath28 for the lz model evolving from @xmath29 to @xmath25 .",
    "we have verified numerically that a slightly larger system ( @xmath30 atoms in @xmath30 lattice sites ) exhibits the same scaling of @xmath31 in the fast and slow transition limit .",
    "thus , these characteristics are not specific to a 2-site toy system only . in the following sections we will use different techniques to argue that the same scaling properties are shared by large lattice models .",
    "before proceeding further , however , we mention that the power - law behavior of the excitation probability when the evolution starts at the anticrossing can be relevant for quantum adiabatic algorithms @xcite . indeed , by starting ( or , by symmetry @xcite , ending ) the algorithm near the anticrossing center the computation has a much higher failure probability .",
    "thus , such situations have to be fiercely avoided when designing a path in hamiltonian space between the initial and the solution hamiltonians .",
    "in this section we consider systems undergoing fast ( @xmath32 ) quenches .",
    "let us start by summarizing some relevant numerical findings on @xmath33 .",
    "we studied numerically system sizes @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the number of lattice sites / atoms ) , and found that in all cases @xcite @xmath36 for @xmath1 s smaller than about @xmath37 . depending on the system size , @xmath38 while @xmath39 equals @xmath40 within fitting errors : see the inset of fig .",
    "[ scaling ] for the @xmath41 case .    moreover , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] , the whole @xmath42 function after the rescaling @xmath43 takes an universal form for @xmath1 smaller than about @xmath37 .",
    "two remarks are in order now .",
    "first , the two site prediction , eq .",
    "( [ kinfty ] ) , shares the same scaling with @xmath1 and a prefactor of the same order of magnitude ( @xmath44 ) as the numerics for larger systems .",
    "second , it is interesting to ask weather the scaling relation ( [ beta ] ) can be experimentally verified .",
    "taking @xmath37 as the largest @xmath1 for which ( [ beta ] ) works very well , we get @xmath45 in @xmath41 case ( fig . [ scaling ] ) . this is to be compared to the ground state predictions at ( i ) the critical point ( @xmath46 @xcite ) , and ( ii ) the asymptotic value deep in superfluid ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus , our results suggest that , despite the fast drive of the system through the transition point , the first correlation builds up macroscopically",
    ". therefore it should be experimentally measurable .",
    ", dots : @xmath48 .",
    "inset : solid line is a power law fit to data for @xmath49 giving @xmath50 .",
    "all data is for @xmath41 and @xmath51 . ]    in the following we will explain the observed behavior of @xmath33 first by the time - dependent perturbation theory , and then by developing a bosonic bogoliubov theory .      for short times we can approximate the wave function using time - dependent perturbation theory , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is assumed and @xmath14 .",
    "a time - dependent variational principle predicts in this case that dynamics of @xmath54 is governed by eq .",

    ": it implies that the way in which the first correlation builds up over time is independent of system size and takes some universal ( independent of @xmath1 ) form after simple rescalings . in fig .",
    "[ k_t_plot ] this prediction is compared to the numerical solution of the @xmath62-site hubbard model .",
    "a perfect agreement is found for times smaller than about @xmath63 . as will be explained in sec .",
    "[ bogoliubov ] , the number fluctuations start to develop significantly around @xmath64 , so it is not surprising that a simple wave function ( [ wp ] ) fails to describe subsequent dynamics .     and",

    "the dashed line presents eq .",
    "( [ k_t ] ) .",
    "the pluses ( @xmath67 ) stand for a numerical solution in the bogoliubov model for @xmath65 and prediction ( [ hatkl ] ) for @xmath68 ( both data overlap ) . ]",
    "using the insight gained from the above studies , we develop bogoliubov approach that includes a macroscopic number of excitations into the wave function and is able to describe longer than nearest neighbor correlations .",
    "our approach is a variant of the theory developed by altman and auerbach @xcite for large density of particles .",
    "we truncate the hilbert space to states with only @xmath69 particles per site .",
    "the initial state is the mott state with exactly @xmath70 particle per site . in a fast transition ( @xmath32 )",
    "we can get well into the superfluid regime of @xmath71 before any substantial number fluctuations have a chance to build up around the initial mott state .",
    "thus , in a fast transition the truncation remains valid well in the superfluid regime .",
    "as already mentioned , the correlators @xmath72 are conserved by the hopping term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the hopping term dominates when @xmath71 and this is why in this regime the correlators are observed to be more or less constant , see fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "our idea is to use a truncated theory to predict correlators @xmath73 up to an instant @xmath74 so large that @xmath75 , but small enough to keep the number fluctuations negligible .",
    "the predicted correlators do not change in the following evolution dominated by the hopping term , so that @xmath76 .    in the truncated hilbert space we call @xmath11 particles in a site a quasiparticle , and an empty site",

    "we introduce the quasiparticle and quasihole creation operators as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "their action is best illustrated by mapping the boson occupation number onto two numbers , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) are quasiparticle ( quasihole ) occupation numbers . this way we have in each site : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . since within the @xmath69 subspace we can not have two quasiparticles / holes in the same site",
    ", the hard - core constraint has to be implemented : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "all this leads to @xmath87 , and analogical relations for the action of @xmath88 and @xmath89 operators .",
    "additionally , we have to remove the states with one quasiparticle and quasihole in the same site , @xmath90 , since these states also do not map onto the @xmath69 subspace .",
    "this is done by the projector @xmath91 .",
    "finally , we note that since we deal with hard - core _ bosons _ all the commutators of quasiparticle / hole operators at different lattice sites commute .    in this new language",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the @xmath69 subspace equals exactly @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is quadratic in quasihole / quasiparticle operators _ 2 & = & -j_i , j   + & + & _",
