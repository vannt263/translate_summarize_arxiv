    "since the first realization of a quantum cascade laser ( qcl ) in 1994 @xcite these semiconductor heterostructures have become important devices in the infrared regime operating up to room temperature @xcite .",
    "lasing in the thz - region was also achieved recently @xcite , opening a new window for applications .",
    "the standard devices contain an injector region guiding the electrons to the upper laser level in an active region where the optical transitions occur between a few discrete levels .",
    "a frequently studied prototype is the sample in @xcite .",
    "different designs are interminiband - qcls @xcite , as well as qcls without injector regions @xcite or containing only four barriers per period like the staircase - laser @xcite and a recent thz - qcl @xcite .    the modeling of quantum cascade lasers was first performed on the basis of rate equations @xcite for the electron dynamics in the active region .",
    "it was assumed that the electrons reach the upper laser level with the rate @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the current density and @xmath2 is the electron charge .",
    "a necessary condition for inversion is that the scattering rate @xmath3 from the upper to the lower laser level is smaller than the out scattering @xmath4 from the lower laser level .",
    "optimizing these scattering rates by a sophisticated choice of well and barrier widths in the active region , qcls with high performance could be designed .",
    "while typically scattering with optical phonons is considered to be the main mechanism for the scattering rates @xcite , electron - electron scattering has also been treated @xcite .",
    "the influence of a magnetic field has been studied by these rate equations in @xcite . while these rate equations for the electron densities @xmath5 [ in units 1/@xmath6 for the levels @xmath7 average over the momentum @xmath8 in the in - plane direction , the distribution functions @xmath9 can be taken into account employing monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "if one includes the injector region in the simulation and imposes periodic boundary conditions ( a good approximation as typical devices have approximately 30 periods each containing an active region and an injector region ) a full simulation of qcl - devices can be performed .",
    "such an approach was performed almost simultaneously on the basis of rate equations @xcite , mc - simulations @xcite and a quantum transport model @xcite obtaining good results for the current - voltage characteristic of a prototype device @xcite .    in this article",
    "we want to show , in how far quantum effects affect the transport and gain behavior and address the question if simple semiclassical models such as rate equations or mc - simulations are applicable . in particular we demonstrate ( i ) that the current can be calculated in a quantum transport model , ( ii ) how this relates to semiclassical approaches , and ( iii ) discuss the implications of many particle corrections on the gain spectra .",
