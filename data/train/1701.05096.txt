    "our results of the adiabatic mce measurements , which indicate two - phase coexistence with hysteresis , agree with these researches . however , the reason of why the mce curves also show the continuous - transition - like behavior is not clear . in the following discussion ,",
    "three possible reasons for this behavior are proposed .",
    "the first possible reason is inhomogeneous stress in the sample .",
    "the sample used in this study is polycrystalline .",
    "the local stress at the grain boundaries could slightly change the transition field .",
    "especially , the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transition is considered to be martensitic @xcite , which implies sensitive to stress .",
    "however , we confirmed that the mce curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mce_bg_ab ] ( b ) were reproduced in four different samples with different settings .",
    "if it originates from local stress , it should depend on the sample quality and show different behaviors for each sample .",
    "therefore , the effect of local stress does not seem to be the dominant reason .",
    "the second one is the magnetic anisotropy of the afm ordered @xmath2 phase @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic susceptibility of the @xmath2 phase is anisotropic , the transition field could vary depending on the orientation of each domain .",
    "the diffuse @xmath2-@xmath0 phase boundary for the polycrystalline sample was proposed in ref . @xcite even though it does not coincide with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab_boundary_fitted ] ) . in this sense",
    ", the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transition should take place in broad area of the @xmath5-@xmath11 phase diagram for polycrystal .",
    "the third one is the intermediate phase between the @xmath2 and @xmath0 phases .",
    "the high - resolution measurement of heat capacity indicated that the peak of the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transition is composed of two sharper peaks with the separation of 0.02 k @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that the double peak is due to the intermediate phase .",
    "interestingly , the helical - ordered intermediate phase is theoretically predicted by slusarev _",
    "_ @xcite and discussed by gaididei and loktev @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of the intermediate phase has not been confirmed in other measurements because of its tiny temperature range .",
    "if the intermediate phase exists , the behavior of the mce curve is not clear ; it depends on the orders of @xmath2-intermediate and intermediate-@xmath0 transitions .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium is not guaranteed for the pulsed field measurement . in any cases",
    ", the existence of the intermediate phase could affect the mce curve in an unusual way .    at this stage ,",
    "we can not conclude which is the main factor to explain the mce curve of the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transition .",
    "for further discussions , single crystal of the solid oxygen @xmath2 phase is necessary . for single crystal",
    ", the effect of strain would be suppressed and the transition field can be discussed for each axis . for the third reason , further investigation is difficult in the pulse field because the precise control of @xmath11 and @xmath5 is necessary .",

    "was observed at just below @xmath25 and @xmath26 , suggesting the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transitions occurred . in the adiabatic condition ,",
    "the entropy of the system is conserved .",
    "when the high - entropy phase is induced by magnetic fields , temperature decreases for compensating the entropy difference at the first - order transition . at that time",
    ", the fraction of the high - field phase gradually increases along the phase boundary with decreasing @xmath11 .",
    "this is the reason for that the field - induced @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transitions had not been observed in pulsed magnetic fields .",
    "the obtained @xmath0-@xmath1 phase boundary was quantitatively explained by the magnetic clausius - clapeyron equation , while the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase boundary was not .",
    "the discrepancy of the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase boundary was attributed to the difficulty of estimating @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    the mce curve at the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase boundary is of typical first - order transition .",
    "on the other hand , the mce curve at the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase boundary has both characteristics of first- and second - order transitions .",
    "we argued this could be due to the polycrystalline sample or the intermediate phase between the @xmath2 and @xmath0 phases . in any cases ,",
    "our results agree with the previous studies which suggest that the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transition is of first - order .",

    "<S> the magnetic - field - temperature phase diagram of solid oxygen is investigated by the adiabatic magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) measurement with pulsed magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> relatively large temperature decrease with hysteresis is observed at just below the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transition temperatures owing to the field - induced transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field dependences of these phase boundaries are obtained as @xmath3 k and @xmath4 k. the magnetic clausius - clapeyron equation quantitatively explains the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath6 , meanwhile , does not @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the mce curve at @xmath6 is of typical first - order , while the curve at @xmath7 seems to have both characteristics of first- and second - order transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the order of the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase transition and propose possible reasons for the unusual behavior . </S>"
