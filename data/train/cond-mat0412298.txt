    "crystals , a ferrimagnetism was found below 19 k in susceptibility experiment , suggesting the ferromagnetic correlation in conducting @xmath88 layers safely .",
    "the evolution of mr with oxygen content and the field - induced downturn of @xmath25 indicate that the ferromagnetic correlation varies dramatically with co ions valence .",

    "this was considered to be due to a pseudogap formation deduced from the abrupt downturn of resistivity.@xcite    another interesting magnetic property in this system is spin density wave .",
    "the sdw emerges from much higher temperature than ferrimagnetism .",
    "@xcite according to our data , the negative mr appears far below @xmath89 , and it coincides with the ferrimagnetic transition . in contrast to ferromagnetic correlation , the sdw has a complete opposite response to co ion valence .",
    "the sdw enhances with reducing co ion valence according to the change of @xmath89 .",
    "this indicates that the ferrimagnetism and the sdw order are _",
    "it is worthy of note that the sdw and ferromagnetic correlation affect the transport and magnetotransport properties strongly , suggesting that the sdw and ferromagnetic correlation coexist in the [ coo@xmath0 ] conducting sheets below ferrimagnetic transition temperature .",
    "the @xmath67sr experiments have suggested the coexistence of the ic - sdw state and ferrimagnetism below 19 k.@xcite sugiyama et al . suggested that the two subsystems of the crystal structure ( the [ ca@xmath5coo@xmath1 rocksalt - type layers and the [ coo@xmath0 ] triangular sheets ) act directly as the two magnetic sublattices for the ferrimagnetism.@xcite from this picture",
    ", one can naturally infer the existence of ferromagnetic spin arrangement in the [ coo@xmath0 ] sheets .",
    "large negative mr and the field - induced i m transition seems to support this picture for the ferromagnetic correlation in the conducting [ coo@xmath0 ] sheets .",
    "however , we can not give detailed picture how the spin arrangement for the coexistence of ferrimagnetism and the ( long - range order ) ic - sdw below @xmath50 because of the absence of the microscopic information of the spins in co ions .",
    "nonetheless , in [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath1@xmath2[coo@xmath0 ] , it can not be a canted - sdw as that found in na@xmath72coo@xmath0@xcite because the spin moments of both sdw and ferrimagnetism are along c - axis and can not be detected in the [ coo@xmath0 ] planes according to @xmath67sr and susceptibility experiment .",
    "also it is very difficult to expect the [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath1@xmath2[coo@xmath0 ] with in - plane ferroamgnetic order and a sdw modulation perpendicular to the planes as proposed by another authors in na@xmath72coo@xmath0@xcite because of the misfit structure between [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath1 and [ coo@xmath0 ] subsystems .",
    "another possible picture is that the sdw order is ferromagnetic , while the sdw order is basically antiferromagnetic .",
    "thus , a macroscopic magnetism should be ferrimagnetic , as actually observed below 19 k. co - nmr and neutron - scattering experiments are desired to make out the exact magnetic structure of [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath1@xmath2[coo@xmath0 ] .",
    "to summarize , the in - plane resistivity was measured in [ ca@xmath0coo@xmath1@xmath2[coo@xmath0 ] single crystals in magnetic fields up to 14 t. the zero field @xmath4 exhibits a minimum and @xmath89 increases with decreasing the oxygen content , indicative of the enhancement of sdw . the sdw strongly depends on the carrier concentration or oxygen content .",
    "large negative mr is observed for all crystals .",
    "while a field - induced i m transition in high magnetic field were observed only in the crystal annealed in oxygen atmosphere .",
    "these results suggests there is ferromagnetic correlation in the system and the correlation is enhanced by increasing oxygen content and magnetic field .",
