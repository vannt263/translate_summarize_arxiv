    "quantum coherence effects arise from interference in the transition amplitudes between quantum states in the presence of a coherent light field .",
    "@xcite perhaps the best known of these effects are electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) or slow light . for many years , there have been proposals to realize quantum coherence effects in few - level systems in solids  @xcite and , in particular , in semiconductors .",
    "@xcite slow light has been achieved in semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) with coherent population oscillations of excitons .",
    "@xcite other approaches inlcude slow light in photonic crystals .",
    "@xcite    semiconductor qds exhibit electron and hole states with discrete energies , and are reminiscent of atomic few - level systems .",
    "the dephasing of the quantum coherences , however , is much different from atomic systems .",
    "in particular , electron - hole transitions in semiconductors typically have short dephasing times which are detrimental for quantum coherence effects and limit the achievable group velocity slowdown , even in qds ,  @xcite . depending on the levels that are connected by drive and probe fields , @xmath1 , @xmath0 and ladder schemes can be realized .  @xcite a direct comparison of these different setups in the framework of an atomic - like model with dephasing constants points toward the @xmath0 scheme as being the most useful and optimizable setup for group - velocity reduction .",
    "@xcite    the reason for investigating @xmath0 type schemes instead of the @xmath1 schemes treated in earlier papers of us  @xcite is that in @xmath1 scheme the quantum coherence connects two hole states .",
    "the hole states in gaas - based semiconductor qds are generally closely spaced and the electron - phonon interaction with polaronic broadening efficiently couples them and leads to a pronounced dephasing for coherences involving hole states . because the drive or probe ( electron - hole ) polarization is susceptible to the same dominant hole contributions of the dephasing , the dephasing of the probe and quantum coherence are roughly of equal size , which is not a good condition for quantum coherence effects . in this case , no group - velocity slowdown can be achieved with a cw drive pulse . instead , a short drive pulse is necessary to slow down the probe pulse ,  @xcite but the time window during which the probe pulse is slowed down , is quite short .",
    "@xcite    the present paper analyzes @xmath0-type quantum coherence schemes in the framework of a microscopic model , both for qds and qd molecules .",
    "it is a companion to our recent paper  @xcite , in which we showed theoretically that one can achieve slowdown of optical pulses in ingaas - based qd molecules that is much larger than in @xmath0-type coherence schemes for single qds systems . as explained in ref .",
    ", both the single qd and qd molecule @xmath0 schemes perform better than the @xmath1 schemes analyzed in our earlier studies  @xcite , because the dephasing rates for the probe and quantum coherence are significantly different in @xmath1 and @xmath0 schemes .",
    "the encouraging results for the achievable group velocity slowdown in qd molecules contained in ref .   are based on an optimized design for the qd molecule states that leads to a long lived coherence between two electronic levels used in the quantum coherence schemes .    in this paper",
    ", we give more details about the `` optimization '' of the qd and qd molecule structures used as input for the microscopic calculation of scattering and dephasing contributions for polarization ( and level population ) . a detailed description of the scattering and dephasing contributions in quantum coherence @xmath0 schemes is contained in ref .",
    ", here we focus on the modeling of the electronic structure of qds and qd molecules to maximize the achievable slowdown .",
    "we describe comparatively simple models for the qd states , which can be calibrated by more realistic numerical calculations , but also permit us to vary important properties of the qd states by changing one ( or a few ) meaningful parameters , such as the depth of the qd confinement potential and/or the distance between the qds making up the qd molecule . for the optimization of the qd structures ,",
    "the figure of merit is a quasi - equilibrium slow - down factor determined by its group - velocity reduction in the frequency domain .",
    "the slow down factor is calculated using a microscopic many - particle approach including carrier scattering and polarization dephasing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sbe ]",
    "we give a brief review over the theory of semiconductor material dynamics , i.e. the semiconductor bloch equations .",
    "section  [ sl_ii ] is devoted to single quantum dots , and investigates the influence of the confinement potential and the lattice temperature on achievable slowdown for ingaas single qds .",
    "section  [ ch_qdm ] is concerned with qd molecules . here",
    ", we describe our model for qd molecules and show in some detail how to compute the electronic energies and states , and highlight the features of our optimized qd molecule for group - velocity slowdown .",
    "the results for group - velocity slowdown are compared with those of single qds .",
    "in this section , we review the theory of semiconductor material dynamics , which is necessary to describe the @xmath0-scheme of the qd system .",
    "first of all , we introduce the optical field written in the form @xmath2 \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the polarization unit vector in @xmath4 direction , and @xmath5 is the frequency of the field @xmath6 .",

    "the dynamics of the polarizations and carrier distributions at the single - particle level are calculated in the framework of the semiconductor bloch equations for the reduced single - particle density matrix .",

    "the correlation contributions are generally denoted by @xmath26 and contain the influence of carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon interactions beyond the hartree - fock level . in particular ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 describe scattering contributions in the dynamical equations for the electron and hole distributions as well as dephasing @xmath29 , @xmath30 in the dynamical equations for the coherences .",

    "qw states has to be considered",
    ". our approach can not handle the whole dots - in - a - well system in one box .",
    "such an approach would naturally yield localized and delocalized eigenfunctions that are orthogonal to each other .",
    "we have to treat the calculation of the three - dimensional qd states separately from the calculation of the qw states . to describe the combined system we orthogonalize the qw states to the qd states as described in ref .",
    "the outcome of this are localized and delocalized eigenfunctions that are orthogonal to each other as used in ref .  .",
    "to determine the spectral gain and group - velocity slowdown in a @xmath0-system , we solve the dynamical equations   for a strong cw drive field with fixed angular frequency @xmath31 and a weak cw probe field with angular frequency @xmath32 . from the steady - state value of the polarization @xmath8",
    "we determine the gain via @xmath33\\ ] ] and refractive - index change @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the background refractive index of the host material .",
    "the group - velocity slowdown factor is defined by @xmath36 , but we will consider only the contribution from the index change @xmath37 in order to remove the static contribution , which describes the change in group velocity due to the background refractive index as compared to vacuum .",
    "in this section we calculate the group - velocity slowdown for single qds with a @xmath0-type configuration of probe and drive pulses , see figure  [ fig_z1](b ) for a sketch of the resulting band lineup .",
    "the results of this section make use of a simplified qd model in order to show  including a microscopic calculation of the relevant dephasing of the quantum coherences the possibility of group velocity slowdown with a cw drive .",
    "these results are also used as a baseline to measure the improvements for group - velocity reduction that come from using optimized qd molecules , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we describe briefly the simple qd model used in this section to calculate the matrix elements needed for the calculation of the microscopic qd dynamics described in section  [ sbe ] .",
    "we assume that the qds are contained in a surrounding quantum well , and that the envelope function for electron and hole states can be written as a product of a wave function in the growth direction @xmath38 of the qw and an in - plane part @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a normalization constant .",
    "the in - plane confinement potential is assumed to be harmonic and is completely specified by the harmonic oscillator level spacing @xmath41 , which is chosen in accordance with measured / calculated values . the in - plane part of the wave function is then given by eigenfunctions of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , cf .",
    "@xcite the band lineup of the qd in this simple model is therefore defined by the spacing of electron and hole levels , as well as the fundamental band - gap .    in the following we use the qd model described above to define two different qds and investigate the group - velocity slowdown performance of these qds by calculating the spectral gain and group - velocity slowdown from the qd material dynamics described in section  [ sbe ] . in particular , we compare the results of the slowdown factor for different lattice temperatures and cw drive intensities .     for a deep qd with ( c ) and without ( d ) static electric field .",

    ", < , < \" , ]      +    an external electric field in growth direction opens up the possibility to shift the energy levels of the qds .",
    "we choose a field that makes the hole ground states of the small and the large qd degenerate .",
    "the other energy levels are not degenerate due to the different energy spacings of the qds .",
    "if we couple these two qds including a suitably chosen static electric field in growth direction , we obtain the energy eigenvalues for different qd distances depicted in figure  [ fig1617 ] . for large distances between the qds , we have effectively two separate qds with different energy spacing between the states .",
    "other than between the hole ground states , no degeneracy of an energy level between the small and the large qd occurs .",
    "an intermediate qd distance allows one to have bonding and antibonding hole ground states with a sizable energy difference , but without significant mixing with the other states , see figure  [ fig1617 ] .",
    "in particular , the electron ground states of the two qds are not significantly mixed .",
    "this configuration can be realized with a dot distance of 14 nm and a static electric field in growth direction with @xmath42mv / nm . we have done test calculations for qd molecules which qualitatively confirm the results of our semi - analytical approach .",
    "only the dependence of energy spacing and qd distance is changed somewhat .",
    "for instance , a @xmath43-calculation , which includes strain and piezoelectric effects , yields a result of approximately 10 nm for this configuration.@xcite the qd molecule with intermediate qd distance is placed in the center of a qw with a thickness of 30 nm . for the qd molecule",
    "we obtain four confined hole and electron states .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are depicted in figure  [ fig15 ] and compiled in the table  [ table-3 ] .",
    "as already mentioned we have a bonding h@xmath44 and antibonding h@xmath45 hole ground state and electron ground states e@xmath46 without a significant mixing between the two qds of the molecule .",
    "therefore the overlap of the wave functions between the two electron ground states is small .",
    "the transitions between the bonding hole ground state h@xmath44 and the electron ground states e@xmath47 and e@xmath48 are dipole allowed with dipole moments of @xmath49 nm and @xmath50 nm , respectively .",
    "thus we can realize a @xmath0-configuration for the qd molecule as shown in figure  [ fig15 ] . the cw drive is chosen resonant with the transition of the bonding hole",
    "ground state h@xmath44 and the electron ground state e@xmath47 ; the cw probe is chosen resonant to the transition between the bonding hole ground state h@xmath44 and the electron ground state e@xmath48 .",
    "the e@xmath51e@xmath48 transition is the quantum coherence transition of the @xmath0-scheme .",
    "we use a qd molecule @xmath0-scheme as introduced in section  [ qdm_asym ] for slowing down light and compare the results with the results from the deep single qd . the peak gain and the peak slowdown",
    "are calculated as in section  [ sl_ii ] and , as for the single qd , we plot these quantities in figure [ fig19 ] for different lattice temperatures . as in section [ sl_ii ] , we obtain generally a more efficient slowdown for lower temperatures .",
    "the most important result of figure  [ fig19 ] is the comparison of the deep single qd and the qd molecule for a lattice temperature of @xmath52k . for",
    "similar peak absorption values an improvement of the peak slowdown by an order of magnitude for the qd molecule is achieved .",
    "this is because in the qd molecule , as compared to the single qd , the dephasing rate of the quantum coherence is much more reduced than the dephasing rate of the interband probe polarization .",
    "this reduction comes particularly from the negligible wave - function overlap between the states of the @xmath53 transition .",
    "the negligible overlap has a huge influence on the electron - phonon _ and electron - electron _ dephasing contributions , especially for the quantum coherence .",
    "this result demonstrates that suitable qd _",
    "molecules _ may be extremely effective for engineering long dephasing times in self - organized semiconductor qd systems .",
    "additional numerical results on the behavior of the group - velocity slowdown are contained in ref .  .",
    "we showed , using a microscopic calculation of scattering and dephasing contributions for the coherences involved , that for group - velocity slowdown in a single qd , a @xmath0-type scheme is preferable to a @xmath54-type scheme . here",
    ", a deep single qd at low temperatures gives the best results .",
    "we discussed how a simple model for qds , which is calibrated by numerical calculations , can be used to analyze the electronic properties of qd _",
    "molecules_. in particular , the electronic structure of qd molecules can be designed to lead to a long lived quantum coherence by effectively separating the electronic states of the @xmath0 system in different qds while leading to a delocalized bonding hole state .",
