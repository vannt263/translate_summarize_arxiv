    "wireless networks , the use of relay is attracting increasing attention [ 1 , 2 ] because of its many advantages . among the relay channels , two - way relay channel ( twrc , as shown in fig .",
    "1 ) is a especially interested due to the almost double spectral efficiency with the physical layer network coding ( pnc ) [ 3 ] transmission scheme .",
    "it was further proved in [ 4 , 5 ] that pnc can approach the capacity of twrc in high snr region .    another spectral efficiency boosting technique is multiple input and multiple output ( mimo ) , which has been widely used in wireless systems .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to combine pnc and mimo to further improve the wireless spectral efficiency .",
    "a straightforward way is to divide the mimo transmission into parallel siso streams by precoding , so that pnc can be implemented on each steam [ 6 ] .",
    "however , the precoding requires not only transmitter side channel state information ( csit ) but also strict time and carrier phase synchronization between the two end nodes .",
    "mimo nc scheme [ 7 ] is more practical , where only receiver side csi ( csir ) is needed . in mimo nc , the relay node detects each end node s packet with traditional mimo detection and then combines them with network coding .",
    "these schemes failed to exploit the fact that the relay does not need each end node s individual information .",
    "hence , the performance is limited by over - detection .    in [ 8 ] ,",
    "we have proposed a novel mimo pnc scheme based on linear detection , which will be referred as linear mimo pnc in this paper .",
    "linear mimo pnc tries to detect the summation and the difference of the two end node s packets before transforming them to the network coding form .",
    "with similar complexity and csir requirement , it significantly outperforms mimo nc .",
    "however , due to the performance limit of linear detection , linear mimo pnc s performance is poor under bad channel conditions .",
    "besides the linear detection , another popular mimo detection method is vblast ( vertical bell laboratories layered space - time ) which can achieve much better performance with an acceptable increase in complexity .",
    "the vblast architecture was first proposed in [ 9 ] where a code block is de - multiplexed into different layers and each is transmitted through a particular antenna . at the receiver , these layers are successively detected , where the detected interference are canceled and the unknown interferences are nulled by linearly weighting the residual signal vector with a zf ( zero - forcing ) null vector ( zf vblast ) .",
    "a low complexity zf vblast scheme is proposed in [ 10 ] , where the channel matrix is rewritten in terms of the qr decomposition as @xmath0 .",
    "the inverse of unitary matrix @xmath1 was then multiplied to the received signal before estimating the transmit information . in order to find the optimal detection order , [ 10 ] further proposed the sorted qr decomposition algorithm , zf - sqrd .    in this paper",
    ", we combine the basic idea of pnc and the qr vblast mimo detection scheme and propose vblast pnc .",
    "our scheme only requires receiver side channel state information and symbol level synchronization between the end nodes , as in general virtual mimo system .",
    "the basic idea of vblast pnc in a 2-by-2 mimo system is as follows .",
    "with qr decomposition , the relay first detects the second layer ( one end node ) signal . rather than canceling all the component of the second layer signal from the first layer as in traditional vblast detection",
    ", we only subtract a part of the second layer information and directly map the residual signal ( including both second and first layer information ) to the network coding form . with such partial interference cancellation , the error propagated from the incorrectly detected second layer is significantly decreased .",
    "thus , the system performance is improved .",
    "we then extend our vblast pnc to a detection scheme with an optimal order as in zf - sqrd , and even better performance is achieved .",
    "numerical simulation is done to compare the performance of vblast pnc with linear mimo pnc and mimo nc schemes .",
    "the results show that vblast pnc can achieve much better ber performance than linear mimo pnc and vblast mimo nc .",
    "this paper is mainly based on the twrc in fig .",
    "1 , where the relay is equipped with 2 antennas and the each end node is equipped with single antenna .",
    "the transmission consists of two phases . in the uplink phase , both",
    "the end nodes transmit their packets to the relay node simultaneously using qpsk modulation .",
    "we assume that the two packets arrive at the relay node in a symbol level synchronization . in that way , the superimposed signal received by the relay is : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the received signal at the @xmath4-th antenna of the relay node ; @xmath5 is zero mean complex gaussian random variable , which denotes the channel coefficient from the end node @xmath6 to the @xmath4-th antenna of the relay node ; @xmath7is the transmitted signal with qpsk modulation of the end node@xmath8 , and @xmath9 demotes the complex gaussian noise with zero mean and @xmath10 variance for each dimension .    in this phase ,",
    "the full channel information is available at the relay node .",
    "rewriting the received signal in the vector form as @xmath11 then , the relay node tries to extract some useful information from @xmath12 and transforming it to the network coded form @xmath13 .",
    "the detailed processing will be illustrated later , which is also the focus of our paper .    in the downlink phase ,",
    "the relay broadcasts the network coded packet to both end nodes . after receiving the packet from the relay ,",
    "the end nodes extract their target packets with the help of their own information .",
    "now , we present an example to illustrate the basic idea of vblast pnc and its superiority over vblast nc , with a simple channel realization .    in the first phase , the transmission in ( 2 )",
    "can be regarded as a @xmath14 mimo system ( two transmit antennas and two received antennas ) .",
    "the relay node s goal is to acquire an estimate of @xmath13 . in the traditional mimo",
    "nc scheme , the relay node decodes @xmath15 and @xmath16 explicitly before network encoding them .",
    "nevertheless , this scheme is suboptimal .",
    "consider an ill - conditioned channel matrix @xmath17 @xmath18\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is a small quantity .",
    "then eq.(1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath20    with qr zf vblast detection , @xmath16 is first detected as @xmath21 according to the processing of vblast , we cancel the interference @xmath16 in @xmath22 and obtain the estimate of @xmath15 as @xmath23    from ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , we can find that the snr of @xmath15 tends to zero when @xmath19 is very small .",
    "it means that the vblast nc scheme ca nt accurately estimate the target signal @xmath13 in this case .",
    "based on the basic idea of pnc , the relay can estimate the target signal @xmath13 from @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we can first estimate @xmath24 rather than estimate individual information of @xmath25 , from @xmath12 .",
    "the particular processing is as follows . after estimating @xmath16",
    ", we subtract @xmath26 rather than @xmath27 from @xmath28 .",
    "then , we can obtain    @xmath29    with the pnc mapping [ 3 ] , we can directly map @xmath30 in ( 7 ) to the target information @xmath13 .",
    "since the noise in ( 7 ) is small ( independent of @xmath31 , the performance of this scheme is much better than the mimo nc scheme .",
    "this example indicates that mimo pnc may significantly outperform the traditional mimo nc . in the following sections , we introduce the proposed vblast pnc scheme in detail .",
    "in this section , we first briefly review the mimo nc scheme based on qr vblast detection algorithm [ 9 , 10 ] for a comparison . after that",
    ", we elaborate the proposed vblast pnc .      consider the 2-by-2 mimo system in ( 2 ) .",
    "the channel matrix can be decomposed with qr decomposition so that @xmath32__qr _ _ , where the matrix @xmath1 is a unitary matrix ( orthogonal columns with unit norm ) and @xmath33 is an upper triangular matrix . multiplying the received signal @xmath12 by @xmath34 ,",
    "we can obtain the calculated signal @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the matrix conjugate transpose and the new noise vector @xmath37 has the same distribution as @xmath38 .",
    "the scalar form of @xmath39 is @xmath40 owing to the upper triangular characteristic of @xmath33 , we can easily estimate the second layer signal ( @xmath16 here ) as :    @xmath41    since the qpsk modulation is adopted , the above signal can be demodulated with hard decision as @xmath42 note that the hard decision in ( [ eq11 ] ) is performed for the real part and the imaginary part respectively . according to the basic idea of vblast , after the second layer signal @xmath16 is detected , we can then detect the first layer signal ( @xmath15 here ) by canceling the interference of @xmath43as : @xmath44    after obtaining the individual decisions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , a straightforward way to calculating @xmath13 is to combine the estimates of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( obtained in ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) respectively ) : @xmath45 hereafter , we refer to this scheme as vblast nc .",
    "vblast nc detects the signals separately with vblast algorithm , and then encodes them into the network - coded form.however , it may perform poorly as shown in our illustrating example .    as in the vblast processing above , exchange of the detection order between x1 and x2 ( first detect @xmath15 and",
    "then cancel it before detecting @xmath46 is also workable . as shown in [ 10 ] , the detection sequence is crucial to the performance of vblast because of the risk of error propagation . to obtain a better performance , we can permute the columns of the channel matrix @xmath17 before the qr decomposition . by carefully selecting the permutation pattern ,",
    "the post - permuted @xmath33 has a larger @xmath47 . as a result ,",
    "the snr of the second layer is increased and the ber is decreased , and the error propagation effect is also decreased .",
    "we can also adopt this sorted algorithm [ 10 ] in our vblast pnc , as elaborated in the following part .      in vblast ,",
    "the diversity order of the first layer should be larger than the second layer in theory under the assumption of clean interference cancellation . in practice",
    ", however , the diversity order of both layers is the same [ 11 ] .",
    "the main reason is the error propagated from the erroneously detected second layer signal . to mitigate the error propagation and better the performance , we propose vblast pnc scheme which only cancels a part of the detected second layer information .",
    "after the cancellation , we require the remaining signal to be in the form of @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an integer .",
    "we can then directly map this signal to the target signal @xmath50 by applying pnc mapping , without explicitly detecting @xmath15 .",
    "since the pnc mapping has similar performances as the ordinary point - to - point transmission , our vblast pnc could achieve a better performance by mitigating the error propagation effects .",
    "the detail of vblast pnc is as follows .",
    "we rewrite @xmath51 in ( 9 ) as @xmath52 where @xmath49 is an integer to be determined later . in ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "we regard @xmath53__kx__@xmath54 as the signal to be estimated and ( @xmath55__-kr__@xmath56 as interference to be cancelled .    in order to decrease the effect of error propagation",
    ", we must minimize ( @xmath55__-kr__@xmath57 .",
    "for example , if @xmath58 , no interference needs to be cancelled and there will never exist error propagation during the detection of the signal in ( [ eq14 ] ) . taking the integer requirement of @xmath49 into account",
    ", we can determine the value of @xmath49 as @xmath59    where @xmath60 means the integer nearest to @xmath61 . in ( 15 )",
    ", @xmath55 is a complex variable and @xmath62 is a real variable , and we only take account the real part to calculate @xmath49 in this paper .    after cancelling the interference with the hard estimate of @xmath16 in ( 11 ) ,",
    "we can obtain the estimate of @xmath63 as @xmath64 finally , the relay node estimates @xmath13 only from @xmath63 as long as @xmath49 does not equal to 0 . when k>0 , intuitively , @xmath65 is larger for @xmath66 , while it is smaller for @xmath67 . when k<0 , the situation reverse",
    ". then , for each dimension ( real part or imaginary part ) signal , the corresponding decision rule is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the decision threshold and its optimal value can be calculated as in [ 3 ] . in high snr , we can simplify the calculation of @xmath69 and set it to @xmath70",
    ". then we have @xmath71    to further improve the performance , we can extend our scheme to the sorted vblast pnc , where the optimal detection order is chosen as the tradition vblast .",
    "in particular , we exchange the columns of @xmath17 to obtain a larger @xmath47 .",
    "then , the vblast algorithm is performed on the new @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , we present the simulation results for the proposed vblast pnc . to compare its performance",
    ", we also show the simulation performance of linear mimo pnc , the performance of linear mimo nc and vblast nc .",
    "the simulation setting is mainly based on the system model in section ii . in particular",
    ", we use qpsk modulation and set the packet length to @xmath72 .",
    "the wireless channels are assumed to be block fading with each entry of the channel matrix to be independently complex gaussian distributed over @xmath73 .",
    "the noise is gaussian distribution with @xmath74 and the snr of the system is defined as @xmath75 .",
    "simulation results are measured in terms of bit error rate ( ber ) of @xmath13 at the relay node since the broadcast phase is straightforward .    in figure 2 ,",
    "we plot the ber performance of different schemes .",
    "as shown in the figure , the proposed mimo pnc schemes always outperform their counterparts .",
    "specifically , our vblast pnc outperforms vblast nc by about 0.5 db at a ber of @xmath76 ; the sorted vblast pnc outperforms sorted vblast nc by about 1db . in sorted vblast",
    ", the more performance improvement mainly comes from the fact that the average value of @xmath62 is smaller and the interference to be cancelled , @xmath77 , is smaller .",
    "in this paper , a novel signal detection and network encoding scheme , vblast pnc , is proposed to extract @xmath13 at the relay node in mimo twrc .",
    "the basic idea is that the relay node first uses partial interference cancellation to obtain @xmath53__kx__@xmath78during vblast detection process and then converts it to @xmath13 with pnc mapping . with partial interference cancellation",
    ", error propagation effect is mitigated and the performance is significantly improved .",
    "the simulation results verified the performance advantages of vblast pnc under the setting of random rayleigh fading channel coefficients .",
    "our scheme is of great interest in practice since only csir , symbol lever synchronization and low complexity are needed .",
