    "the subject of counting statistics is rooted in the historical paper by schottky @xcite where the measurements of charge noise have been carried out and interpreted as the basis for determining the elementary charge @xmath2 of the current carriers : electrons .",
    "contemporary transport experiments are being performed on nano - structures , usually involving two electron reservoirs ( left and right ) and a central constriction @xcite .",
    "the mean electric current , or linear conductance is well understood in terms of scattering theory @xcite and , for a single conducting channel , is given by the landauer formula : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transmission coefficient and factor 2 stems from the electron spin . however , due to the quantum nature of the problem , the current is bound to fluctuate . in particular , this gives rise to interesting noise ( the second moment of the current distribution ) properties extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .    with the third moment of the current distribution now available",
    "experimentally @xcite , it is natural to widen the question to the full current distribution function or the full counting statistics ( fcs ) .",
    "one way to formulate this question is to ask what is the probability @xmath5 that charge @xmath6 will be transmitted through the system during the waiting time @xmath7 and for a given bias voltage @xmath8",
    ". as electrons are discrete particles , a naive guess at @xmath5 would be the poisson s distribution : @xmath9 where @xmath10 . for simplicity , we set @xmath11 in what follows .",
    "the electrons , however , are not only discrete particles but also quantum particles obeying fermi - dirac statistics . due to the pauli principle",
    "the electrons will tunnel ` one by one ' .",
    "so , given the ` number of attempts ' , @xmath12 , one would expect the total probability be proportional to the probability of successes @xmath13 as well as the probability of failures @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting probability distribution is binomial : @xmath15   t_0^q(1-t_0)^{n - q}\\;,\\ ] ] where the binomial coefficient in front simply follows from the normalization : @xmath16 .",
    "note that the binomial distribution is a clear signature of fermi statistics ; indeed , the respective probability distribution for bosons is the inverse binomial @xcite . in practice , it is more convenient to work with the generating function @xmath17 , where the fourier transform variable @xmath18 is called the ` counting field ' ( see below )",
    ". the irreducible moments of the charge distribution immediately follow @xcite : @xmath19 the generating function for the binomial distribution is simply : @xmath20^n\\;.\\ ] ] from this equation one easily recovers the landauer formula , @xmath21 , the well known expression for the shot noise @xmath22 , and obtains the following expression for the third moment : @xmath23 .",
    "note that for low transmission ( @xmath24 ) , the statistics reverts to poissonian , while for perfect transmission ( @xmath25 ) , there are no current fluctuations and @xmath26 .",
    "the physics described so far has been understood in the seminal paper by levitov and lesovik @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where they derive a more general formula for the generating function @xmath27 \\big\\ } \\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is valid for finite voltage , temperatures , and allows for the energy dependent transmission coefficient .",
    "here @xmath28 are the thermal electron distributions in the left and right leads and @xmath29 is the fermi function .",
    "clearly @xmath4 is @xmath30 at the fermi energy , set at @xmath31 .",
    "schnhammer has recently re - examined this formula , eq.([llformula ] ) , by an alternative method , and found that it is correct @xcite .",
    "the discussion so far has focused upon _ non - interacting _ electrons .",
    "but while counting statistics for non - interacting electrons is by now comprehensively understood , the same can not be said when the electrons interact with each other and with the substrate .",
    "consequently the understanding of the interaction effects on the fcs has become an important issue .",
    "there has been many papers on the subject in recent years with many interesting yet miscellaneous results .",
    "certainly no general paradigm as to how interactions should affect the statistics has as yet emerged .",
    "misunderstandings dominating the subject only a short time ago are well illustrated by the following example .",
    "the generating function @xmath32 for matveev s coulomb blockade setup @xcite ( equivalent to the @xmath33 kane and fisher problem @xcite , which is in turn equivalent to the @xmath34 dissipation problem first solved by guinea @xcite ) has been calculated independently by three different methods in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite with seemingly very different results .",
    "it was only understood later that all three results are indeed correct and represent one and the same function ( see appendix c to ref .",
    "moreover the distribution in question turned out both to be simple and to represent a particular case of eqn .",
    "( [ llformula ] ) with a specific choice of the transmission coefficient , @xmath30 .",
    "this lack of a coherent picture of the fcs in strongly correlated systems is , we believe , simply explained .",
    "as is illustrated by the prominence of the fermi and luttinger liquid paradigms , it is accepted that in the condensed matter it is the _ low - energy _ physics which is universal .",
    "the fcs is no exception . on an energy scale set by the bare parameters , it is therefore the low - temperature , low - voltage expansions of @xmath32 where universal results are to be found",
    ". the high - voltage ( temperature ) distributions may be enormously fascinating but are destined to remain model dependent .    in this paper",
    "we collect together a number of such universal results , presented in two parts . in the first part , sections ii and iii , we study the generating function , @xmath35 , using keldysh perturbation theory in a fermi liquid approach . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the keldysh method for calculating the statistics . in the process",
    "we establish an exact relationship between the generating function and the self energy . in section iii",
    ", we study the fcs for the aim both in perturbation theory and in the strong coupling limit . by comparing the two we propose a conjecture for @xmath35 at low voltages , i.e. @xmath0 , but valid at all orders of the interaction .    in the second part of the paper , sections iv through vi , we switch tacts and instead employ a bethe ansatz analysis of the current moments for the aim .",
    "we however limit ourselves to exploring the behavior of the current and the current noise in the aim s kondo regime .",
    "our results for these quantities differ from those of the first section of this paper . here",
    "the focus is on their qualitative not quantitative features but over a larger range of voltages ( though still much smaller than any bare energy scale ) and for finite magnetic fields . in section",
    "iv we review the bethe ansatz method for calculating the current and noise .",
    "we then present results for zero magnetic field in section v where , in addition , a comparison is made to fermi liquid calculations . in the final section , section vi , we consider the properties of the noise in finite magnetic fields . here",
    "is found the most significant result of the second part of the paper .",
    "we are argue that in the vicinity of voltages commensurate with the magnetic field , the current noise should see a double humped enhancement .",
    "this enhancement is the analog of that seen in the current when @xmath1 and so represents a smoking gun @xcite of kondo physics .",
    "the calculation of the charge statistics is usually accomplished by coupling the system to a ` measuring device ' . in the original gedanken experiment by levitov and lesovik",
    "it is a fictitious spin-@xmath36 galvanometer coupled to the current @xcite .",
    "the transmitted charge is then proportional to the change of the spin phase .",
    "as has been shown by nazarov @xcite , the counting of charge can in general be done by coupling the system to a fictitious field and calculating the non - linear response , so leading to the same results .",
    "in fact the standard quantum mechanical formula , @xmath37 , can also be used provided that the central region is initially decoupled from the leads .    according to @xcite the generating function",
    "is given by the following average , @xmath38 \\right\\rangle\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the keldysh contour @xcite , @xmath40 is the _ measuring field _ which is non - zero only during the measuring time @xmath41 : @xmath42 on the forward path and @xmath43 on the backward path . introducing the operator @xmath44 transferring electrons through the system in the direction of the current , as well as its counterpart @xmath45",
    ", we can write @xmath46 note that @xmath47 in any system . consequently",
    ", writing out ( [ chi ] ) explicitly in terms of the time  ordered and anti  time  ordered products , one arrives at the conjugation property , @xmath48 we now allow @xmath40 to be an arbitrary function on the keldysh contour , @xmath49 on the forward / backward path .",
    "then a generalised expression for the generating function is @xmath50=\\langle t_{\\rm c }    e^{-i\\int_{{\\rm c } } \\ , dt \\",
    ",    t_\\lambda(t)}\\rangle \\ , .\\ ] ] assume that the measuring field changes only very slowly in time . then one can write @xmath51=\\exp\\left[-i\\int_0^{\\cal t } { \\cal u}[\\lambda_-(t),\\lambda_+(t)]dt \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the",
    "_ adiabatic potential_. note that eq.([potential ] ) captures the leading , linear in @xmath7 , contribution to the phase . for a truly slow - varying measuring field ( analytic in @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the corrections are exponentially small in @xmath7",
    ". even if the function @xmath40 has isolated jumps , eq.([potential ] ) still holds at large @xmath7 , but the corrections are then of the order of @xmath54 .",
    "this is in full analogy to the non - equilibrium version @xcite of the old x - ray problem .",
    "once the adiabatic potential is known , the statistics is given by @xmath55 alternatively one can level off the @xmath56 functions in eq.([chipm ] ) to different constants as @xmath57\\to\\chi(\\lambda_-,\\lambda_+)\\;,\\ ] ] then @xmath58 .",
    "note that the conjugation property ( [ conj ] ) now generalises to @xmath59 or @xmath60    to compute the adiabatic potential we observe that according to the non - equilibrium version of the the feynman ",
    "hellmann theorem @xcite , @xmath61 where the averages are defined as @xmath62 ( and similarly for multi  point functions ) where @xmath18 s are understood to be _ different _ on the two time branches .",
    "note that the above one  point averages depend on the branch the time @xmath53 is on ( though not on the value of @xmath53 on that branch ) : @xmath63 therefore the average in eq .",
    "( [ fhel ] ) _ must _ be taken on the forward branch of the keldysh contour .",
    "an advantage of this hamiltonian approach is that the calculation of the adiabatic potential @xmath64 is reduced to a calculation of green s functions ( gf ) , albeit non - equilibrium ones .",
    "so we can use the well developed diagram technique ( and relate to many known results within this method ) without being restricted to the scattering problem .    the conventional test model to consider is the anderson impurity model ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model consists of three contributions , @xmath65 the kinetic part @xmath66+\\sum_\\sigma(\\delta_0 + \\sigma h)d^\\dagger_\\sigma d_\\sigma \\ , , \\ ] ] describes a single fermionic level ( which we shall also call the ` dot ' ) with electron creation operators , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the spin index ) , energy , @xmath69 , and subject to a local magnetic field , @xmath70 .",
    "the electrons in the two non - interacting metallic leads , @xmath71 , are represented by @xmath72 .",
    "the leads and the dot are coupled via the tunnelling operator , @xmath73 \\ , , \\ ] ] with , in general , different amplitudes , @xmath74 .",
    "we have included the counting field into the hamiltonian ( left junction ) .",
    "one can as well incorporate it into the right junction ( or both ) , the results are the same due to the gauge symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "finally , we include the coulomb repulsion on the dot , @xmath75 where @xmath76 . the bias voltage @xmath8 is incorporated into the full hamiltonian by assuming different chemical potentials in the leads : @xmath77 .",
    "it is useful to define two auxiliary gfs , @xmath78 hence the derivative of the adiabatic potential is given by @xmath79\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is standard , the mixed gf s can be written as combinations of bare lead gf s and an exact impurity gf , @xmath80 , @xmath81 plugging this back into eq.([uf ] ) one obtains @xmath82 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "thus the problem is now reduced to calculation of the impurity gf .    to illustrate how the method works we start with the trivial case of the resonant level model : @xmath84 .",

    "inserting this result into eq.([ulr ] ) and integrating over @xmath93 ( which can be done in a closed form ) leads to the formula ( [ llformula ] ) with the breit - wigner transmission coefficient , @xmath94 as expected for the resonant level problem .",
    "turning to the interacting case , we define the impurity self - energy in the standard fashion @xcite : @xmath95 substituting this into ( [ ulr ] ) one obtains a _",

    "@xmath97 is the determinant of the ( inverse ) interacting impurity gf . for @xmath98",
    "this equation yields the electric current and can be shown to reproduce the result by meir and wingreen @xcite .",
    "formula ( [ fi ] ) is not restricted to the anderson model but is applicable for any similar one - channel systems ( for example , one can add on the electron  phonon interaction or consider a double dot ) .    the general formula ( [ fi ] )",
    "allows us to investigate the important limit : linear response statistics at zero temperature .",
    "indeed let us take a closer look at the general formula .",
    "an important technical observation is that the limits @xmath99 and @xmath100 do not commute in the presence of the counting field . indeed , calculating the keldysh determinant in both limits we see that even for the non - interacting case @xmath101 but @xmath102 the latter scheme needs to be implemented when analyzing the first term in eq.([fi ] ) in the linear response limit , as the energy integration here is restricted to @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "this leads to a transmission coefficient type contribution to the generating function ( see below ) . in the second term in eq.([fi ] ) , however , the integration over @xmath104 is not restricted to @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "but due to auger type effects @xcite one expects that there are contributions to the current ( and fcs ) at all energies .",
    "this effect is itself proportional to the applied voltage and only leads to non - linear corrections to the fcs .",
    "hence the energy integration can in fact be regarded as restricted to @xmath103 $ ] even in the second term in eq.([fi ] ) .",
    "since the self - energy does not have external lines and all the internal frequencies have to be integrated over , the limits @xmath99 and @xmath105 in this case commute .",
    "that means that for the evaluation of the self - energy to the lowest order in @xmath8 one is allowed to use the equilibrium gfs , calculated in presence of the counting field @xmath18 , i.  e. ( [ dbareu ] ) with @xmath106 and with the corresponding keldysh denominator",
    ". therefore all diagonal keldysh gfs are equal to those in the equilibrium and all off - diagonal ones are simply proportional to the same diagrams as in equilibrium .",

    "the bethe ansatz gives us the ability to compute @xmath184 _ in equilibrium _ up to corrections of @xmath185 .",
    "we intend to use these equilibrium amplitudes to characterize _ qualitatively _ the behaviour of the noise as a function of @xmath186 . using equilibrium scattering amplitudes",
    "necessarily involves missing some of the physics present in a non - equilibrium setting .",
    "nonetheless we believe that this approach yields important insights .",
    "in particular , the general behaviour of the noise in a magnetic field that arises from this approach , should be robust enough to survive this particular approximation .",
    "this is already true of the current through the dot in a magnetic field where this approach @xcite yields results consistent with the observed enhancement @xcite in the conductance when @xmath187 .",
    "we now turn to a brief description of how to compute @xmath184 using the bethe ansatz solution of the anderson model . for additional details see @xcite .",
    "the description comes in three parts .",
    "we first describe how to map the _ equilibrium _ ( zero voltage ) problem onto an one - channel anderson model , a model directly solvable by bethe ansatz .",
    "although we work directly in a one lead formulation of the problem , we are still able to make contact with scattering in the original two lead picture .",
    "we so identify the relevant elements of the exact one - channel solution for computing scattering amplitudes .    to reformulate the problem in a way amenable to the bethe ansatz , we introduce even / odd electrons @xmath188 with this , the odd electron decouples from the dot leaving us with an interacting theory of even electrons alone : @xmath189 we point out that the bethe ansatz could be directly applied to the two channel problem",
    ". however under the diagonalization of @xmath190 carried out by the bethe ansatz , the map ( [ eiiiii ] ) is implemented implicitly .",
    "as such we prefer to make the change of basis directly .    under this one - lead reformulation , we are still able to make contact with the scattering amplitudes of electronic excitations off the quantum dot .",
    "let @xmath191/@xmath192 be the transmission / reflection amplitudes of electronic excitations of energy , @xmath193 , between leads in the original two lead picture .",
    "on the other hand , the even / odd excitations will scatter off the dot with some pure phase , @xmath194 . as the scattering in the odd channel is trivial , @xmath195 .",
    "the two sets of amplitudes are related according to ( [ eiiiii ] ) : @xmath196 our focus will henceforth be on computing @xmath197 .    to determine @xmath198 , we employ an energetics argument of the sort used by n. andrei in the computation of the magnetoresistance of impurities in a bulk metal @xcite .",
    "imagine adding an electron to the system . through periodic boundary conditions , its momentum is quantized , @xmath199 .",
    "if the dot was absent , the quantization condition would be determined solely by the conditions in the bulk of the system and we would write , @xmath200 . upon including the dot , this bulk momentum is shifted by a term scaling as @xmath201 .",
    "the quantization condition is then rewritten as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the system s length .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath201 term is identified with the scattering phase of the electron off the dot .",
    "we thus must compute the impurity momenta of excitations in the problem .",
    "the bethe ansatz solution of the one channel anderson model was first described in @xcite and @xcite . as with any problem with an @xmath204 symmetry ,",
    "the bethe ansatz yields a set of quantization conditions describing two types of excitations , one parameterized by @xmath205 and associated roughly with charge excitations , and one parameterized by @xmath206 and associated approximately with spin excitations : @xmath207 where @xmath208 here @xmath209 is the total number of particles in the system and @xmath210 marks out the spin projection of the system , @xmath211 ( in zero magnetic field @xmath212 ) .    the possible solutions to the above quantization conditions are manifold .",
    "however most are only significant at finite temperature . at zero temperature",
    ", the ground state of the system is formed solely from real @xmath205 s ( and then only if the magnetic field is non - zero ) and from bound states of real @xmath206 s together with complex @xmath205 s .",
    "specifically , the ground state contains : @xmath213 these elementary excitations implement a spin - charge separation in the model with the @xmath205 s representing the charge sector while the @xmath18 s represent the spin sector .    in the continuum limit , these excitations are described by smooth densities , @xmath214 for the real @xmath205 s and @xmath215 for the @xmath206 s .",
    "equations valid at the symmetric point of the anderson model describing these densities can be derived in the standard fashion @xcite : @xmath216 where @xmath203 is the system size and @xmath217 @xmath218 marks out the ` fermi - surface ' of the @xmath205 distribution . between @xmath219 ( the bottom of the band ) and",
    "@xmath218 there is a sea of @xmath205 excitations .",
    "the fermi surface of the @xmath206 particles on the other hand is set at @xmath220 : at the symmetric point , the sea of @xmath206 excitations in the ground state extends from @xmath221 to @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the bandwidth of the @xmath206 excitations .",
    "this is a crucial simplification which makes possible many of our closed - form results . for most purposes",
    "both bandwidths , @xmath224 and @xmath223 , can be taken to be @xmath225 .",
    "the density equations neatly divide into bulk and impurity pieces via @xmath226 the impurity densities of states contain all the information needed about degrees of freedom living on the quantum dot .",
    "the equations governing these densities are @xmath227 for example , the total numbers of spin @xmath228 and @xmath229 electrons living on the dot are @xmath230 the latter equations for each of @xmath231 and @xmath232 are a result of simplifications at the symmetric point .",
    "the energies and momenta of these excitations can be derived through well known techniques @xcite .",
    "the energies are given by @xmath233 the momenta are akin to the densities in that they divide into bulk and impurity pieces @xcite .",
    "the bulk momenta are related directly to the energies via @xmath234 the impurity momenta can be expressed in terms of the impurity density of states @xmath235 as already discussed , the impurity momenta are the quantities crucial to computing scattering phases .",
    "these relations will thus allow us to express the scattering phases in terms of integrals over the impurity density of states .    in order to determine the scattering phase of an electron ( as opposed to a spin or charge excitation ) , we must specify how to glue together a spin and a charge excitation to form the electron .",
    "the situation is analogous to adding a single particle excitation in the attractive hubbard model . adding a single spin @xmath228 electron to the system",
    "demands that we add a real @xmath205 ( charge ) excitation .",
    "but at the same time we create a hole at some @xmath206 in the spin distribution .",
    "the number of the available slots in the spin distribution is determined by the total number of electrons in the system .",
    "adding an electron to the system thus opens up an additional slot in the @xmath206-distribution .",
    "the electron scattering phase off the impurity is then the difference of the right - moving k - impurity momentum , @xmath236 , and the left - moving @xmath206-hole impurity momentum @xmath237 : @xmath238 we must now consider how to choose @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "as we are interested in the dc noise , we must compute scattering away from the fermi surface .",
    "thus if we are to compute the scattering of an excitation of energy , @xmath239 , we must choose the @xmath205 and @xmath206 such that @xmath240 however this constraint does not uniquely specify a particular choice of @xmath241 .",
    "we , in general , can not lift this degeneracy . however at the symmetric point of the anderson model",
    ", we can make an ansatz which has already proven to be successful in the computation of the finite temperature linear response conductance @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the electron scattering phase is determined by the impurity densities , @xmath242 and @xmath243 . at the symmetric point of the anderson model , the scattering phase",
    "is expected to vary as @xmath244 , the kondo temperature .",
    "of the two impurity densities , only @xmath242 varies as @xmath245 while @xmath243 is controlled by the much larger scale , @xmath246 .",
    "thus in computing electronic scattering phases away from the fermi surface at @xmath118 , it is natural to choose @xmath206 at its fermi surface value , i.e. @xmath221 and vary @xmath205 according to the energy in which we are interested . specifically , we choose @xmath205 such that @xmath247 we thus have removed the ambiguity in the choice of @xmath241 .    in making this ansatz",
    "we are effectively doing the following .",
    "imagine an electron in the leads with some energy @xmath239 .",
    "we can imagine expanding this state in terms of the basis of bethe ansatz states : @xmath248 are _ exact _ eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "although we only possess incomplete knowledge of this expansion , it would be a reasonable guess that it contains multiple terms .",
    "however our ansatz supposes only a single state contributes .",
    "but because of the hierarchy of scales , @xmath249 , in the problem , we expect additional terms in the expansion of eqn .",
    "( [ eiiixx ] ) to have coefficients of @xmath250 .    under this ansatz ,",
    "the scattering phase of the spin @xmath228 electron at some energy , @xmath239 , above the fermi surface is then @xmath251 when the magnetic field , @xmath252 , is 0 , @xmath253 and we can only directly compute the scattering of spin @xmath228 electrons .",
    "however with @xmath254 , @xmath255 takes on negative values and so we can also compute spin @xmath228 hole scattering . to add a spin @xmath228 hole with energy , @xmath256 , we remove a @xmath205 and a @xmath206-hole in the spirit of our previous ansatz : @xmath257 the scattering phase is then @xmath258 so",
    "far we have computed the scattering of spin @xmath228 objects . to compute spin @xmath229 quantities ,",
    "we employ the particle - hole transformation relating spin @xmath228 to spin @xmath229 : @xmath259 where the last line only follows at the symmetric point . with this transformation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath260 our inability to directly compute spin @xmath229 scattering is a technical peculiarity of the bethe ansatz @xcite .      we have now described how to compute the scattering amplitudes as a function of energy in equilibrium . the error in using these amplitudes in describing out - of - equilibrium quantities such as the current or the noise has two possible sources .",
    "the first source can be seen from the way the differing chemical potentials of the right and left reservoirs appear in the hamiltonian : @xmath261 under the map to the even and odd basis ( [ eiiiii ] ) , this term becomes non - diagonal , coupling the even and odd sectors .",
    "this coupling between sectors , in turn , lifts the model s integrability , the basis on which we compute @xmath262 .",
    "one might have hoped @xcite that the state of the system in non - equilibrium could still be characterized by using in - equilibrium data in a fashion analogous to the manner in which out - of - equilibrium quantum hall edges can be characterized exactly @xcite .",
    "while in analyzing the hall edges , an even - odd transformation of bosonic degrees of freedom is employed , the hall case is much simpler as the current as well as the coupling to the voltage bias , can be expressed directly in terms of the odd degree of freedom .",
    "but in the case of the anderson model , the current and voltage involve both even and odd degrees of freedom . in mapping back to the left - right basis , some sort of breaking of integrability then occurs .",
    "we will see this explicitly when we compute the noise at zero magnetic field and compare it to the exact fermi liquid results .    a second source of error in using the equilibrium scattering amplitudes concerns the manner in which we construct the electronic scattering states .",
    "as we have already indicated , there is a multiplicity of choices in how we construct the scattering states .",
    "the particular choice we employed was the simplest that met the requirement that the energy dependence of the scattering varies on the kondo scale .",
    "however this choice is not unique and while it produced excellent results for the behaviour of the finite temperature linear response conductance , it may not be optimal for the description of out - of - equilibrium scattering .",
    "in this section we compute the noise in zero magnetic field and compare it at small voltages to the fermi liquid results from the first part of this article . to compute the noise ,",
    "we imagine biasing the leads as in figure 1 with @xmath263 . for convenience we set @xmath264 to zero and @xmath265 .",
    "then as discussed in the previous section , the noise is given by @xmath266 at @xmath267 spin @xmath228 and spin @xmath229 scattering are the same , i.e. @xmath268 . as we are scattering electrons from lead @xmath269 with energy @xmath270 into lead @xmath203 , we are equivalently interested in computing the scattering phase of a hole . in section iv we demonstrated that at @xmath267 we are able to compute the scattering amplitude of a spin @xmath229 hole",
    ". specifically we have @xmath271 in @xcite we were able to evaluate these expressions in closed form : @xmath272;\\cr\\cr \\tilde{t}_k & \\equiv & \\frac{2}{\\pi}t_k = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{u\\gamma}{2 } } e^{-\\pi ( \\frac{u}{8\\gamma } - \\frac{\\gamma}{2u})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equation gives the crossover scale , @xmath245 , the kondo temperature , in terms of the bare parameters of the model @xcite . with this , @xmath273 equals @xmath274 for typical realization of kondo physics in quantum dots , i.e. @xcite , the error term is insignificant .",
    "and so we compute the noise to be @xmath275 the quantity @xmath276 is solely a function of the ratio @xmath277 and is plotted against @xmath278 in fig .",
    "( note that @xmath279 . )",
    "we see that as @xmath277 is varied , the noise rapidly rises at first , peaks at @xmath280 , and then begins to gradually decline .",
    "this behaviour is closely related to the kondo resonance in the spectral impurity density of states .",
    "as we express the scattering phases in terms of the impurity density of states , we probe the resonance . the width , @xmath281 , of this resonance , @xmath282 , corresponds to the energy scale at which we expect maximal noise .",
    "the noise in this case can be reexpressed in terms of the current , @xmath283 , and the differential conductance , @xmath284 , @xmath285 with the result @xmath286 at small @xmath287 , @xmath288 we can compare this result with the fermi liquid result @xmath289 in making this comparison , there is a certain arbitrariness in how one defines @xmath140 .",
    "this can be overcome by appealing to the finite temperature linear response conductance , @xmath290 to fix the manner in which @xmath140 is to be defined . in our conventions then , @xmath291 ) .",
    "we see then that the fermi liquid result differs from the result based upon the equilibrium bethe ansatz scattering states by a factor of 5/8 .",
    "a similar difference can be found between the fermi liquid and bethe ansatz computation for the current . at small @xmath287 , the leading order correction to the current ( of @xmath292 )",
    "is given by @xmath293 this compares to the fermi liquid result @xmath294 we see that the fermi liquid result is considerably smaller than that of the bethe ansatz .",
    "this might well reflect the role of incoherent scattering processes that would be unaccounted for properly by using equilibrium scattering amplitudes .",
    "finally we consider the value of the effective charge , @xmath295 , in the problem .",
    "this charge is given as a ratio of the noise to the backscattering current : @xmath296 in the case of the bethe ansatz , we find @xmath297 , that is , we find the johnson - nyquist result for shot noise in the weak scattering limit .",
    "however in fermi liquid theory , the effective charge is found to be @xmath298 @xcite .",
    "that the effective charge goes unchanged from its non - interacting value is again presumably a consequence of the use of equilibrium scattering states .    while the use of the equilibrium bethe ansatz scattering states gets quantitative details of the noise ( and the current ) incorrect , it gets qualitative features correct . in particular the conductance as a function of voltage",
    "is lorenztian - like with a width of order @xmath140 .",
    "similarly the zero field noise as a function of voltage increases rapidly ( on a scale of order @xmath140 ) and thereafter decreases slowly .",
    "both of these features would be expected to be present based solely upon the presence of the kondo / abrikosov - suhl resonance whose width is governed by the scale @xmath140 .",
    "in this section we compute the noise in a finite magnetic ( zeeman ) field .",
    "we will here argue that the finite field noise possesses features that can be considered a `` smoking gun '' @xcite of kondo physics .",
    "we believe that these features are robust and so should be captured by our approach .    to compute the noise , @xmath299 in a finite field",

    "@xcite this bifurcation was studied where it was found that the peak occurs at a value of @xmath335 distinctly smaller than @xmath252 and not @xmath336 . in the case of the noise , we again find that the peaked structure in it occurs at values of @xmath335 smaller than @xmath252 .",
    "we believe this double peaked structure in the noise , inasmuch as it depends on the gross dependency of the scattering amplitudes upon h , to be a robust feature .",
    "less certain are the quantitative predictions that arise from this analysis",

    "to summarize , we have presented analyzes of the moments of the current using both fermi liquid perturbation theory and the bethe ansatz .",
    "both approaches however remain incomplete . in the fermi liquid approach , while we have derived results for the higher moments of the current valid , we believe , at all orders of the interaction strength , we have done so only at the lowest non - trivial order in the voltage .",

    "we have managed to identify various robust features of the current noise that should be experimentally identifiable in current realizations of quantum dots . in particular , we have identified a double peaked structure in the noise that appears at finite magnetic fields .",
    "but because of our use of _ equilibrium _ scattering amplitudes , we have been able to focus only upon qualitative aspects of the physics . quantitatively , the methodology produces results at variance with fermi liquid theory .",

    "<S> we arrive at a conjecture for an expression for the fcs generating function at @xmath0 ( v is the voltage across the impurity ) valid at all orders in the interaction .    in the second part of the article </S>",
    "<S> , we examine a bethe ansatz analysis of the current noise for the aim . unlike the fermi liquid approach , here </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to obtain qualitative , not quantitative , results for a wider range of voltages both in and out of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> particularly notable are finite field results showing a double peaked structure in the current noise for voltages satisfying @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this double peaked structure is the `` smoking gun '' of kondo physics in the current noise and is directly analogous to the single peak structure predicted for the differential conductance of the aim . </S>"
