    "compton scattering of a laser beam with a relativistic electron beam has become an efficient source of highly polarized , intense x - ray and @xmath0-ray radiations .",
    "these monoenergetic and tunable compton photon beams find numerous industrial , medical , and scientific applications .",
    "in particular , they bring a great deal of attention in the view of future colliders such as the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite , and the super b  @xcite , which are planned to use the compton @xmath0 rays to produce highly polarized positrons . taking into account those various applications and research interests",
    ", it becomes of great importance to predict theoretically spectral and spatial distributions of compton photon beams , and to control their properties using the incident beam parameters .",
    "the hypothesis of a wavelength shift of x - rays scattered by a free electron at rest has been put forward by compton in ref .",
    "@xcite , and proved by himself experimentally  @xcite . following theoretical investigations",
    "have been focused on the so - called _ linear compton scattering _",
    "however , in extremely intense laser fields the scattering can occur in a nonlinear regime ; the process known as the _ nonlinear compton scattering_. for the development of related theoretical studies , the reader is referred to a recent review by ehlotzky and co - authors  @xcite . in brief , in a majority of works concerning the nonlinear compton process , the incident laser beam has been described as a monochromatic plane wave field which enables one to fully account for the electron  laser - beam interaction using standard methods of strong - field quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "the first analysis that goes beyond the monochromatic plane - wave approximation when analyzing the nonlinear compton scattering that we are aware of was by neville and rohrlich  @xcite . by generalizing the usual strong - field qed methods to account for a finite length plane - wave - fronted pulse , the authors considered the compton scattering by a klein - gordon particle .",
    "although the method proposed in  @xcite allows to consider qed processes in laser pulses of an arbitrary duration and strength it has not had a big impact until very recently . only very few papers on the scattering of a dirac particle by a shaped laser pulse can be found in the literature .",
    "there is a paper by narozhny and fofanov  @xcite who have considered a situation when a driving laser pulse is still sufficiently long to allow to simplify the problem significantly . in ref",
    "@xcite , the same approach has been persuaded in the context of a resonant compton scattering . however , for intense few - cycle laser pulses which are used nowadays in experimental setups , a more adequate treatment of the temporal structure of an incident laser pulse is necessary .",
    "this has been offered in very recent papers  @xcite using the approach of neville and rohrlich  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , boca and florescu have formulated the formalism for the nonlinear compton scattering based on temporally shaped volkov solutions for a dirac particle .",
    "the calculated spectral distributions of compton photons were compared for different pulse shapes and pulse durations . in the limit of a long pulse ,",
    "these results coincide with the results of  @xcite showing no significant dependence on the precise form of the laser pulse . on the other hand , for",
    "short laser pulses pronounced carrier - envelope phase effects in spectral distributions of the compton photons were demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "a complementary study for single - cycle laser pulses was presented in  @xcite , whereas the emphasis on a comparison with the _ nonlinear thomson scattering _ ( for reviews , see , for instance  @xcite ) was put in refs .",
    "all these theoretical works follow various related experiments .",
    "experimentally , the nonlinear compton scattering of relativistic electrons by an intense laser pulse has been observed for the first time by englert and rinehart  @xcite . in another experiment ,",
    "the transition between the thomson and compton regimes of electron scattering has been reported  @xcite .",
    "however , the most prominent experiment showing nonlinear effects in the compton scattering is the slac experiment  @xcite in which the fourth harmonic of the compton radiation was detected .    using the approach of neville and rohrlich  @xcite , developed recently by boca and florescu  @xcite",

    "our focus here is to develop new theoretical and numerical methods to describe the situation when the incident laser field represents either an isolated laser pulse or a train of such pulses .",
    "the sensitivity of both spectral and angular distributions of the compton radiation to a laser pulse duration will be studied in this paper in great detail .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , we shall introduce the theory of compton scattering of electrons by a temporally shaped ultrastrong laser beam .",
    "two cases will be considered , when the laser beam is represented by a train of laser pulses ( sec .",
    "[ train ] ) and by an individual laser pulse ( sec .",
    "[ single ] ) . in each case",
    ", a distribution of emitted radiation energy will be defined such that a comparison between the two situations is possible . in sec .",
    "[ shape ] , we shall define a laser pulse shape that will be used in our numerical calculations . in sec .",
    "[ freq ] , we will analyze frequency distributions of compton photons for different pulse durations . the results for an isolated laser pulse , a train of laser pulses , and for a monochromatic laser field will be compared .",
    "angular distributions of emitted radiation for a single laser pulse will be shown in sec .",
    "[ angular ] .",
    "the emphasis will be put there on asymmetries in angular distributions which are observed for compton processes induced by ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "[ conclusions ] will then be devoted to a summary of our results and to some final remarks .    throughout the paper , we use the following mathematical convention and notation . in formulas ,",

    "each of these situations requires a separate theoretical treatment .",
