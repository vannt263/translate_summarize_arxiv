    "the fundamental properties of strongly interacting matter are investigated in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . with these experiments",
    "one aims at understanding the basic processes in qcd matter at finite temperature @xmath0 and/or baryon density . for this purpose",
    "heavy quarks are a particularly clean probe of the formed matter because they are predominantly produced from initial hard scatterings of participating nucleons .",
    "subsequently they undergo collisional and radiative processes through interactions with the locally thermalized light quarks and gluons in the surrounding medium .    these interactions with the medium constituents",
    "lead to a thermalization of heavy quarks with small transverse momentum @xmath1 , while those with a large @xmath1 suffer from a significant in - medium energy loss .",
    "this is reflected in sensitive observables such as the nuclear modification factor @xmath2 .",
    "results from rhic for the heavy - flavour decay non - photonic single electron @xmath2 as well as the @xmath2 of d - mesons  @xcite indicate indeed a substantial quenching of heavy quarks at higher @xmath1 up to @xmath3  gev .",
    "the data from the latest measurements at the lhc  @xcite was able to extend this @xmath1-range up to @xmath4  gev for very central collisions .",
    "this offers a new and unique opportunity for testing our understanding of in - medium energy loss mechanisms , with the prospect of disentangling eventually the different contributions from collisional and radiative energy loss processes .",
    "radiative processes are considered to be the dominant contribution to parton energy loss at larger parton energies , but they may become affected by coherence effects in the medium , cf .  the review in  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence of the destructive interference of radiation amplitudes from successive scatterings off medium constituents within the formation length @xmath5 of gluon - bremsstrahlung , the radiation spectrum is suppressed for larger gluon energies @xmath6 .",
    "this is the qcd - analog of the landau - pomerantschuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect  @xcite .",
    "other effects may alter the radiation pattern as well .",
    "for example , the dielectric polarization of the medium modifies the dispersion relation of radiated gluons which aquire an effective in - medium mass @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to a significant reduction of the radiation spectrum in the soft-@xmath6 region  @xcite .",
    "similarly , dissipative effects in the qcd medium may diminish the radiative energy loss of heavy quarks as advocated in  @xcite .    in these proceedings ,",
    "we discuss the dissipative effect of gluon damping on the radiation spectra of heavy quarks .",
    "focussing on the implementation of the novel effect into our monte - carlo approach to the heavy - quark in - medium propagation  @xcite we show that damping mechanisms influence the @xmath2 of heavy quarks in a pronounced way .",
    "in an absorptive plasma , mechanisms , which lead to the damping of bremsstrahlung gluons , can reduce the radiative energy loss of traversing , highly - energetic charges .",
    "this phenomenon was first demonstrated in  @xcite for asymptotic electric charges in electro - magnetic plasmas by modelling the dispersive medium via a complex index of refraction and then advocated in  @xcite to be of relevance also in the absorptive quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "in fact , dissipative effects such as quark  anti - quark pair creation or secondary gluon - bremsstrahlung generation introduce an additional scale in the medium .",
    "if this damping length scale @xmath8 , which is related to the gluon damping rate @xmath9 as @xmath10 , is smaller than or of the order of @xmath5 of the nascent gluon , absorptive mechanisms will reduce the probability for the formation of gluon - bremsstrahlung and , thus , influence the radiative energy loss of partons",
    ". this might be particularly important in the case of the large formation lengths in coherent emission processes .",
    "even though the aforementioned mechanisms represent higher - order effects in perturbative qcd , they might be relevant for the matter investigated in the laboratory .",
    "for example , the damping rate due to secondary gluon - bremsstrahlung formation is parametrically given as @xmath11 up to logarithmic corrections of order @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "consequently , higher temperatures imply a larger damping rate and thus a smaller @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the formation length of gluon radiation  @xcite increases for a given @xmath13 with increasing energy @xmath14 of the emitting parton .",
    "thus , for large e ( as long as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the parton path length in the medium ) and/or large @xmath0 dissipative effects will be important for the radiation spectra of partons , a situation that is likely to be encountered experimentally at the lhc .",
    "+    the gunion - bertsch ( gb ) gluon radiation spectrum  @xcite originating from single , independent scatterings of massless partons was generalized within scalar qcd to the case of massive partons in  @xcite .",
    "medium - modifications of this heavy - quark gb - spectrum due to coherence effects were discussed in detail in  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , we show the radiation spectra of both cases for charm and bottom quarks at different parton energies @xmath14 .    in order to highlight quantitatively the additional impact of gluon damping effects on the bremsstrahlung spectrum off heavy quarks , we make use of a scaling ansatz advocated in  @xcite according to which the global radiation intensity becomes modified due to medium effects via @xmath17 . here , the scale @xmath18 with the parton mass @xmath19 denotes the formation length in a single , independent scattering process @xcite and @xmath20 is given by the minimum between the damping length @xmath8 and the in - medium formation length @xmath5 discussed in  @xcite fulfilling @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] exhibits the correspondingly modified spectra for two different values of @xmath9 . as evident , damping effects may reduce the heavy - quark radiation spectrum significantly in an intermediate @xmath6-region , where the influence of the dissipative effects increases with both increasing @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "this reduction is stronger than the reduction due to the lpm - effect .",
    "moreover , with larger @xmath9 and larger @xmath14 the spectra become more and more quark - mass independent .",
    "to study the consequences of gluon damping on observables , we include the modified radiation spectra illustrated above in the monte - carlo approach  @xcite to the heavy - quark propagation in the medium .",
    "the interaction of the heavy quarks with the light partons in the qgp amounts in collisional and radiative processes , which are described in detail in  @xcite , while the evolution of the medium is obtained from the fluid dynamic expansion presented in  @xcite .",
    "any theoretical uncertainty affecting the model is assumed to be captured in one global factor k which rescales the interaction rates and which is obtained from calibration to the available rhic data . in this spirit",
    "it is possible to reproduce the available heavy - flavour data at rhic energies for both purely collisional and collisional plus radiative ( without damping ) energy loss scenarios as was demonstrated in  @xcite . at lhc energies ,",
    "the @xmath1-range is extended and we are able to identify different trends in the @xmath2 for these two scenarios , cf .",
    "counter - intuitively , available d - meson data from central @xmath22 collisions at the lhc  @xcite seem to favour the purely collisional energy loss scenario  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that a reduction of the radiative energy loss component would be necessary in order to reconcile the model with the data . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa ] , one possibility for such a reduction could be the inclusion of gluon damping mechanisms .",
    "r[0pt]0.55     here , we show the @xmath2 of charm and bottom quarks for the collisional plus radiative energy loss scenario ( dashed curves ) , which includes the lpm effect but no dissipative effects . the inclusion of gluon damping mechanisms results in the solid curves . as evident ,",
    "when one neglects gluon damping effects , the @xmath2 stays almost flat for @xmath23  gev for the charm quarks and for @xmath24  gev for the heavier bottom quarks .",
    "once gluon damping is taken into account , the nuclear modification factor increases visibly at higher transverse momenta . in the shown @xmath1-range predominantly charm quarks are affected , while the effect sets in for bottom quarks only at larger @xmath1 .",
    "details , however , depend on the value of the gluon damping rate .",
    "we discussed the influence of gluon damping in the absorptive qgp on the quenching of heavy quarks in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in addition to the known modification of radiation spectra due to coherence effects , gluon damping effects reduce significantly the spectra in an intermediate @xmath6-region for large gluon damping rates @xmath9 and/or large parton energies @xmath14 . consequently ,",
    "in the absorptive qgp heavy quarks become less quenched at large transverse momenta . with increasing @xmath1 , the quenching seems to become quark - mass independent which would be visible in a prominent behaviour of the heavy - flavour meson @xmath2 as advocated in  @xcite .",
