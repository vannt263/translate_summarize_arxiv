    "the minority game ( mg ) introduced by challet and zhang @xcite offers possibly the simplest paradigm for a complex , dynamical system comprising many competing agents .",
    "models based on the minority game concept have a broad range of potential applications , for example financial markets , biological systems , crowding phenomena and routing problems @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies of the statistical properties of the mg @xcite which treat the game as a quasi - stochastic system .    in this paper",
    "we examine the mg from a different perspective by treating it as a primarily _ deterministic _ system and then exploring the rich dynamics which result . our desire to look at microscopic dynamical properties , as opposed to global statistics , is motivated by the fact that the physical systems we are interested in modeling are only realized once ( e.g. the time - evolution of a financial market ) .",
    "only limited insight is therefore available from taking configuration averages in such cases .",
    "in addition it is of great interest to examine transient effects such as the response of the system to perturbations , and the mechanisms which determine the game s trajectories in time .",
    "we find that we are able to provide a description of the resulting deterministic dynamics via mapping equations , and can hence investigate these important effects .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : after briefly discussing the mg in the remainder of this section , sec .",
    "2 examines the mg as a functional map .",
    "section 3 focuses on the effect of the underlying ( ` quenched ' ) disorder arising from unequal population of the strategy - space .",
    "section 4 discusses the dynamics of the game on a de bruijn graph .",
    "section 5 provides the conclusions .",
    "the most basic formulation of a mg comprises an odd number of agents @xmath0 who at each turn of the game choose between two options ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' @xcite .",
    "these options could be used to represent buy / sell , choose road a / road b etc .",
    "the aim of the agents is common : to choose the least - subscribed option , the ` minority ' group . at the end of each turn of the game",
    ", the winning decision corresponds to the minority group and is announced to all the agents .",
    "the agents have a _ memory _ of @xmath1 bits , hence they can recall the last @xmath1 winning decisions .",
    "the _ global information _ @xmath2  available to each and every agent is therefore a binary word @xmath1 bits long , hence @xmath2 belongs to the set @xmath3 where @xmath4 . in order to make a decision about which option to choose , each agent is allotted @xmath5 _ strategies _ at the outset of the game , which can not be altered during the game .",
    "each strategy @xmath6  maps every possible value of @xmath2 to a prediction @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "there are @xmath10  different possible binary strategies .",
    "however , many of the strategies in this space are similar to one another , i.e. they are separated by a small hamming distance .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the principle features of the mg are reproduced in a smaller _ reduced strategy space _ ( rss )  of @xmath11  strategies , in which any two strategies are separated by a hamming distance of 2@xmath12  or @xmath13 , i.e. the two strategies are _ anti - correlated _ or _ un - correlated _ respectively .",
    "the agents follow the prediction of their historically best - performing strategy .",
    "they measure this performance by rewarding strategies with the correct mapping of global information to winning decision , and penalizing those with an incorrect mapping .",
    "strategies are scored in this manner irrespective of whether they are played . as each agent will reward and penalize the same strategy in the same way , there is a common set of strategy scores which are collected together to form the _ strategy score vector _ @xmath14 .",
    "the common perception of a strategy s success or failure will lead to agents deciding to use or avoid the same strategy in groups - this leads to crowd behavior as analyzed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the minority game is often introduced heuristically as a set of rules determining the update of the agents strategies and the global information .",
    "it can however easily be cast into a functional map which reproduces the game when iterated .",
    "moreover , this functional map can be iterated _ without _ having to keep track of the labels for individual agents .",
    "we achieve this by introducing a formalism which groups together agents who hold the same combination of strategies , and hence respond in an identical way to all values of the global information set @xmath15 .",
    "this grouping is achieved via the tensor which is initialized at the outset of the game and quantifies the particular quenched disorder for that game @xcite . is @xmath5-dimensional with rows / columns of length @xmath16 ( in the rss ) such that entry @xmath17 is the number of agents holding strategies @xmath18 .",
    "the entries of ( and also of the strategy score vector ) are ordered by increasing decimal equivalent .",
    "for example , strategies from the rss for @xmath19 are ordered @xmath20 , therefore strategy @xmath6 is anti - correlated to strategy @xmath21 . is randomly filled with uniform probability such that @xmath22 it is useful to construct a configuration of this tensor , , which is symmetric in the sense that @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is any permutation of strategies @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 we let @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "now we proceed to a formula for the attendance @xmath29 of the mg ( i.e. the sum of all the agents predictions and hence actions ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the response of strategy @xmath6 to global information @xmath2 and @xmath32 is the number of agents playing strategy @xmath6 .",
    "we can define @xmath32 in terms of the strategy score vector and and hence rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq attendance basic ]  to give the following for @xmath27 : @xmath33    &   = \\sum_{r=1}^{2p}a_{r}^{\\mu}% \\sum_{r^{\\prime}=1}^{2p}\\left (   1+\\operatorname{sgn}\\left [   s_{r}% -s_{r^{\\prime}}\\right ]   \\right )   \\underline{\\underline{\\psi}}_{r , r^{\\prime}% } \\label{eq attendance}\\\\ &   + \\sum_{r\\neq r^{\\prime}}^{2p}a_{r}^{\\mu}\\delta_{s_{r},s_{r^{\\prime}}% } \\left (   \\operatorname{bin}\\left [   2\\underline{\\underline{\\psi}}_{r , r^{\\prime } } , \\frac{1}{2}\\right ]   -\\underline{\\underline{\\psi}}_{r , r^{\\prime}}\\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34   $ ] is a sample from a binomial distribution of @xmath35 trials with probability of success @xmath36 . here",

    "the second term of this attendance equation ( eq . [ eq attendance ] ) introduces a stochastic element in the game ; it corresponds to the situation where agents may have several top - scoring strategies and must thereby toss a coin to decide which to use .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "[ eq attendance ] could be re - written replacing the @xmath38 function with a @xmath39 .",
    "the effect of this would be to make the number of agents playing strategy @xmath40 ( as opposed to their other strategy @xmath41 ) vary smoothly as a function of the separation in score of the two strategies , rather than simply playing the best .",
    "this modification is similar in concept to that of the thermal minority game ( tmg ) @xcite wherein agents play their best strategy with a certain probability depending on its score .",
    "the difference here would be that , in contrast to the tmg , the system would still be entirely deterministic hence lending itself readily to similar analysis as presented here .    with this formalism , the game can be described concisely by the following coupled mapping equations : @xmath42    &   = \\underline{s}\\left [   t-1\\right ] -\\underline{a}^{\\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   } \\chi\\left [   a\\left [   \\underline { s}\\left [   t-1\\right ]   , \\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   \\right ]   \\right ] \\label{eq score update}\\\\ \\mu\\left [   t\\right ]    &   = 2\\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   -p\\operatorname{h}\\left [ \\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   -\\frac{p}{2}\\right ]   + \\operatorname{h}\\left [   -a\\left [ \\underline{s}\\left [   t-1\\right ]   , \\mu\\left [   t-1\\right ]   \\right ]   \\right ] \\label{eq hist update}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43   $ ] is the heaviside function and @xmath44   $ ] is a monotonic , increasing function of the game attendance quantifying the particular choice of reward structure ( i.e. payoff ) .",
    "in most of the mg literature @xmath44 = \\operatorname{sgn}\\left [   a\\right ]   $ ] or @xmath44   = a$ ] @xcite .",
    "although the macroscopic statistical properties of the mg are largely unaltered by the choice of @xmath45 , we later demonstrate that the microscopic dynamics can be affected markedly .",
    "this formulation shows that the mg obeys a one - step , stochastically perturbed deterministic mapping between states @xmath46 , \\mu\\left [   t\\right ]   \\}$ ] and @xmath47   , \\mu\\left [ t+1\\right ]   \\}$ ] .",
    "it is interesting to ask the following question : ` how important is the stochastic term of eq .",
    "[ eq attendance ] to the resultant dynamics ? ' .",
    "table 1 shows the frequency with which the outcome ( @xmath48   $ ] ) is changed by the stochastic perturbation to the mapping .",
    "we can see that the stochastic term has a small but non - negligible effect on the game .  for the strategy reward system @xmath49 ,",
    "the number of instances of coin - tossing agents affecting the outcome is greater than with the proportional reward system of @xmath50 .",
    "this is easily understood in terms of the homogeneity of the score - vector @xmath14 ; the @xmath49 scoring system is much more likely to generate tied strategies than the @xmath50 system which also incorporates the dynamics of the attendance @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath49 scoring system there will be a much higher proportion of coin - tossing agents and thus a greater effect on the game .",
    "the general effect of the stochastic contribution to the mg is to break the pattern of behavior emergent from the deterministic part of the map .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to examine further what the dynamics of this deterministic behavior are .",
    "to do this we replace the stochastic term of eq .",

    "we will now use this system to investigate the emergence of microscopic and macroscopic dynamics .",
    "the game is conditioned at the start with the initial state @xmath56   , \\mu\\left [   0\\right ]   \\}$ ] .",
    "it is also given a @xmath57 tensor for a particular parameter set @xmath58 .",

    "the game is said to be in an ` efficient phase ' @xcite where all states of the global information set @xmath2 are visited equally and hence , on average , there is no drift in the strategies scores i.e. @xmath63 . in this regime ,",
    "the disorder in the @xmath64  tensor is small and thus all elements are approximately of equal magnitude .",
    "this in turn implies that the dynamics of the game are dominated by the movement of @xmath14 rather than by the asymmetry of @xmath65 .",

    "3 would be flat with no structure .    we have thus shown how market impact is profoundly manifest within the structure of the mg @xcite . in particular , fig .",
    "2 shows clearly that consideration of market impact is necessary in the calculation of the transition point from efficient to inefficient regimes @xcite .",
    "the game enters the inefficient regime if the magnitude of the bias term to the score increment ( arising from disorder in @xmath57 ) exceeds the magnitude of the restoring force term .",

    "we would like to stress here that only _ on average _ does there exist a specific point at which the game passes from mean - reverting to biased behavior ( efficient to inefficient regime ) . because the behavior of the game is dictated by the disorder in and not just by the specific parameters @xmath58 alone ,",
    "a knowledge of @xmath97 is not enough information to classify the game as being in either the efficient or inefficient regime .",
    "therefore it seems arguable as to whether @xmath116 is a ` critical ' value for any particular realization of this system .",
    "equation [ eq score inc ] can also yield insight into the dynamics in the regime past the transition point .",
    "we were able to predict from eq .",
    "[ eq score inc rho ] that in the efficient regime , pairs of anti - correlated strategies would cycle around each other thus producing an ever changing score rank vector @xmath117 . in the inefficient regime",
    "wherein the strategy scores have appreciable bias , it would be natural to assume that @xmath117 would rapidly find a steady state as the strategy scores diverged .",
    "this in fact does not happen ; for example , consider the outermost pair of strategies in the score - space ( i.e. the current best , and its anti - correlated partner the worst ) at a point in the game .",

    "however , we could just as correctly view @xmath152   $ ] as the current state , left by some other game process such as a shock to the system , a build up from some other game mechanism or a stochastic perturbation .",

    "the ` initial ' condition @xmath152   $ ] must obey the form @xmath154 ; this is to ensure that a priori no strategies are given a bias",

    "we expect that if the elements @xmath156   $ ] have magnitude less than @xmath16 then the system will very quickly lock into the eulerian trail trajectory and visit all @xmath157-states equally .",

    "this persistence in trajectory at each node of the de bruijn graph will lead to the game visiting only a small subset of the vertices on the graph unlike in the stable - state situation .",
    "this reduced cycling effect may lead to a bias in the attendance over a significant period of time , i.e. a ` crash ' or ` rally ' .",
    "we now demonstrate the recovery of the dmg from a randomly chosen initial score vector @xmath152   $ ] .",
    "we take a system with low disorder in @xmath57 and @xmath19 ( such that @xmath159 ) .",

    "the initial condition is soon ` worked out ' of the system - it rapidly finds the eulerian cycle @xmath162 after only 174 turns .",
    "as can also be seen , the game adopts several different types of cycle on its way towards this stable state .",
    "the switch between cycle types occurs as each vertex snaps from persistent to anti - persistent behavior .",
    "we have hence discussed and explained the dynamics of the stable state , and how the system enters that state from an initial or perturbed state .",
    "this analysis has been for the system in the efficient phase where the quenched disorder of @xmath57 is low .",
    "the inefficient regime will in general show a different set of dynamics .",
    "as discussed earlier , the inefficient phase is characterized by score vectors which have an appreciable drift ; this is an effect of the disorder in @xmath57 . the corresponding unbounded",
    "@xmath163   $ ] vector leads to an unbounded set of states for the system @xmath164 .",
    "this suggests that the overall dynamics may be aperiodic , i.e. the system never returns to a past state .",
    "we can however say something about the nature of the resulting dynamics in @xmath2-space .",
    "as the score vector diverges the score rank vector @xmath117 becomes more well defined ( although not completely stationary in time , as mentioned in sec . [ sec disorder ] ) .",
    "this is tantamount to there being a certain degree of persistence in the attendance at a vertex @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "this will lead to the motion around the de bruijn graph being limited to a certain sub - space , just as that described above for the recovery from an initial score vector @xmath152   $ ] .",
    "this difference in the dynamics for the efficient and inefficient regimes leads to the well - documented result that the occurrence of different @xmath165 bit words is even in the efficient regime but very uneven in the inefficient regime @xcite .",
    "the results in this paper confirm that the mg can be usefully viewed as a stochastically perturbed deterministic system , and that this deterministic system can be described concisely by coupled mapping equations ( eqs .",

    "we used this system to explore the dynamics of the score vector @xmath166   $ ] .",
    "we showed that the score increment comprises a bias and restoring - force term , the comparative magnitude of these terms being governed by the disorder in the strategy population tensor @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , we were able to obtain analytic approximations for the bias and restoring force terms .",
    "we showed how the market - impact effect correlated the strategy population to the score vector and how this then affected our approximations .",
