    "it is well known in particle physics that mixing between a neutral @xmath8 meson and its @xmath1-conjugate counterpart @xmath9 can arise , if both of them couple to a subset of virtual and ( or ) real intermediate states .",
    "such mixing effects provide a mechanism whereby interference in the transition amplitudes of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons may occur , leading to the possibility of @xmath1 violation . determining the magnitude of @xmath10 mixing and probing possible @xmath1-violating phenomena in the @xmath10 system",
    "have been a challenging task for particle physicists .",
    "to date , @xmath11 and @xmath12 mixing rates have been measured , and the @xmath1-violating signal induced by @xmath11 mixing has been unambiguously established @xcite .",
    "many sophisticated experimental efforts , such as the programs of @xmath13 factories , @xmath2 factories and high - luminosity hadron machines , are being made to discover new signals of @xmath1 asymmetries beyond the @xmath11 system and to precisely measure the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) matrix elements .",
    "the study of mixing and @xmath1 violation in the @xmath14 quark sector , particularly in the @xmath0 system , is not only complementary to our knowledge on the @xmath11 and @xmath15 systems , but also important for exploring possible new physics that is out of reach of the standard model predictions .",
    "the rate of @xmath0 mixing is commonly measured by two well - defined dimensionless parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which correspond to the mass and width differences of @xmath16 and @xmath17 mass eigenstates .",
    "the latest e691 data of fermilab fixed target experiments only give an upper bound on @xmath0 mixing @xcite : @xmath18 in the standard model the short - distance contribution to @xmath0 mixing is via box diagrams and its magnitude is expected to be negligibly small ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite ) . the long - distance effect on @xmath0 mixing comes mainly from the real intermediate states of @xmath21 multiplets , such as @xmath22 and is possible to be significant if the @xmath21 symmetry is badly broken ( e.g. , @xmath23 @xcite )",
    ". however , the dispersive approach @xcite and the heavy quark effective theory @xcite seem to favor a much smaller result for the long - distance contribution : @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "such theoretical discrepancies indicate our poor understanding of the dynamics for @xmath0 mixing , hence more efforts in both theory and experiments to better constrain the mixing rate are desirable . if calculations based on the standard model can reliably limit @xmath6 and @xmath7 to be well below @xmath26 , then observation of @xmath27 at the level of @xmath28 or so will imply the existence of new physics . on the other hand ,",
    "improved experimental knowledge of @xmath27 , in particular the relative magnitude of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , can definitely clarify the ambiguities in current theoretical estimates and shed some light on both the dynamics of @xmath0 mixing and possible sources of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath1 violation in the @xmath0 system was first developed by bigi and sanda @xcite , and further summarized by bigi in ref .",
    "these works have outlined the main features of @xmath0 mixing and @xmath1 asymmetries anticipated to appear in neutral @xmath4-meson decays , although many of their formulas and results are approximate or just for the illustrative purpose .",

    "we show that it is possible to determine the relative magnitude of @xmath6 and @xmath7 through observation of the dilepton events of coherent @xmath5 decays on the @xmath33 resonance at a @xmath3-charm factory .",
    "a model - independent constraint on @xmath0 mixing can also be obtained by measuring the decay - time distributions of @xmath34 etc . by use of the isospin analysis and current data , we illustrate final - state interactions in @xmath35 and their influence on @xmath1 violation .",

    "recently colladay and kosteleck@xmath611 have studied a few possibilities to examine @xmath41 symmetry in neutral @xmath4 decays on the basis of the future fixed target and @xmath3-charm factory experiments @xcite . considering this work and some other works on tests of @xmath41 symmetry in the @xmath15 system @xcite , we want to remark that one of the most sensitive signals for @xmath41 violation or @xmath610 transitions should be the nonvanishing asymmetry @xmath160 defined in eq .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that @xmath163 might also come from the phase shifts of final - state electromagnetic interactions or the @xmath1-violating contributions of non - standard electroweak models to the tree - level @xmath298-mediated semileptonic @xmath4 decays .",
    "another possible way to test @xmath41 invariance in @xmath0 mixing , which in principle works , is to measure the time distributions of opposite - sign dilepton events at an asymmetric @xmath3-charm factory ( see appendix b ) .",

    "one can check that integrating @xmath626 over @xmath272 , where @xmath627 , will lead to the time - independent decay rate @xmath628 given in eq .",
    "( a1 ) and ( a2 ) are two basic formulas for investigating coherent @xmath629 decays at asymmetric @xmath3-charm factories .    another possibility is to measure the time - integrated decay rates of @xmath630 with a proper time cut , which can sometimes increase the sizes of @xmath1 asymmetries @xcite . in practice",
    ", appropriate time cuts can also suppress background and improve statistic accuracy of signals .",
    "if the decay events in the time region @xmath631 or @xmath632 $ ] are used , where @xmath633 , the respective decay rates can be defined by @xmath634 by use of eqs .",

    "thus it is possible to enhance a @xmath1-violating term ( and suppress the others ) via a suitable cut @xmath639 .      in this appendix",
    "we take a brief look at the possible effect of @xmath41 violation in @xmath0 mixing on the decay rates of semileptonic @xmath4 decays . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the @xmath42 rule and direct @xmath41 invariance in @xmath4 decays to hold exactly .",
    "we also assume the absence of final - state electromagnetic interactions and other sources of new physics that could affect the tree - level @xmath298-mediated @xmath4 decays . due to the presence of @xmath41 violation ,",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath49 and @xmath50 can now be expressed as @xmath640 where @xmath641 is in general complex .",
    "note that @xmath41 invariance requires @xmath642 , while @xmath1 conservation requires both @xmath642 and @xmath643 @xcite .",

    "( 2.1 ) from eq .",

    "we find @xmath647 where @xmath648 has been defined before .",

    "since @xmath650 must be a small quantity , the @xmath651 term in the denominatior of @xmath160 is negligible .",
    "anyway observation of the signal @xmath160 will be greatly difficult in practice , since its magnitude is suppressed by both the small mixing rate and the small @xmath41 asymmetry .",
    "next let us assume the experimental scenario to be an asymmetric @xmath3-charm factory , in which @xmath5 pairs can be coherently produced at the @xmath652 or @xmath653 resonance and the time - dependent measurements of their decays are available . to probe possible @xmath41 violation in @xmath0 mixing",

    "it is clear that the opposite - sign dilepton events @xmath668 can not be used to explore possible @xmath41 violation in @xmath0 mixing , because the time order of @xmath669 and @xmath670 is hardly distinguishable in practical experiments .",
    "in addition , the signal of @xmath41 violation can not manifest itself in the time - integrated decay rates of @xmath671 , as obviously shown by the equations above .",
