    "quantum entanglement is a quintessence of quantum mechanics that nowadays finds applications in the field of quantum communication and information processing .",
    "entanglement assisted communication requires the communicating parties , alice and bob , to establish an entangled state between their systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this can be done _ only _ by using a global operation , e.g. sending a quantum system @xmath2 between them , as entanglement can not be created by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily imply that the system @xmath2 must be entangled with the other two systems as everybody would intuitively expect .",
    "namely , for the quantum mixed states only classical correlations and quantum interference suffice to create entanglement @xcite .",
    "specifically , for mixed states one can establish a distillable entanglement between two qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 by using a third qubit @xmath2 being always separable from the two - qubit system @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has a number of implications for quantum communication , which still have to be fully explored .",
    "for instance , quantum teleportation @xcite does not require transmission of an entangled quantum system between the sender and the receiver .",
    "distribution of entanglement without sending entanglement was first suggested for qubits @xcite and only recently , an alternative protocol for entanglement distribution by separable states was proposed for gaussian states of infinitely - dimensional quantum systems and quantum variables with continuous spectra - continuous variables ( cvs ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study how the cv protocol works . to that aim",
    "we propose a new protocol distributing entanglement with more than an order of the magnitude higher logarithmic negativity than the previous one @xcite .",
    "the proposed protocol is more simple and allows to fully explain the physical mechanism underlying the phenomenon of cv entanglement distribution by separable states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_1 ] contains a brief introduction into the formalism of gaussian states . in sec .",
    "[ sec_2 ] we remind the original scheme for distribution of cv entanglement by separable gaussian states .",
    "section [ sec_3 ] is dedicated to the proposal of a new improved scheme for establishing entanglement using separable ancilla . in sec .",
    "[ sec_4 ] we explain the physics behind the distribution of cv entanglement by separable states .",
    "section  [ sec_5 ] covers conclusion and comments on the experimental feasibility of the protocol .",
    "we consider three distinguishable infinite - dimensional quantum systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , referred to as `` mode @xmath6 , '' `` mode @xmath7 , '' and `` mode @xmath5 . ''",
    "the modes are described by three pairs of canonically conjugate quadrature operators @xmath8 , @xmath9 satisfying the canonical commutation rules @xmath10=[p_{j},p_{k}]=0 $ ] , @xmath11=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] . defining the column vector @xmath12 the commutation rules can be written in the compact form @xmath13=-i\\omega_{jk}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the standard three - mode symplectic matrix .",
    "all states of our three - mode system can be represented in the real six - dimensional phase space by the wigner function @xcite and gaussian states are defined as those states for which the wigner function is gaussian .",
    "any three - mode gaussian state @xmath15 can be therefore fully characterized by the real six - dimensional vector @xmath16 of phase - space displacements and by the @xmath17 real symmetric covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath18 with elements @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . due to",
    "the commutation rules the cm @xmath18 satisfies the uncertainty relation @xcite @xmath22 in the following section we are interested in separability properties of three - mode gaussian states and therefore we need a separability criterion for all possible @xmath23-mode bipartitions , i.e. bipartitions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for this purpose we can use the positive partial transpose ( ppt )",
    "criterion @xcite translated to gaussian states @xcite . on the level of cms the partial transposition with respect to the mode @xmath27 transforms the cm @xmath18 to @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the diagonal matrices @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a pauli diagonal matrix @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a @xmath37 identity matrix .",
    "the ppt criterion then says that a three - mode gaussian state with cm @xmath18 is separable with respect to bipartition @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is an even permutation of @xmath40 ) if and only if the matrix @xmath41 satisfies the uncertainty relation ( [ uncertainty ] ) @xcite , i.e. @xmath42 the ppt criterion can be expressed in another equivalent form that can be sometimes easier to use in practice .",
    "it relies on the fact that for any matrix @xmath41 of a partially transposed state there exists a symplectic matrix @xmath43 , i.e. a real @xmath17 matrix satisfying the condition @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the nonnegative quantities @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the so called symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath41 and @xmath18 is separable with respect to the splitting @xmath38 if and only if @xmath48 @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the symplectic eigenvalues can be computed via the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath50 which are @xmath51 .",
    "for complex three - mode states the symplectic eigenvalues are involved and it is easier to use the ppt criterion formulated in terms of the symplectic invariants @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath41 possesses three such invariants denoted @xmath52 and @xmath53 that can be calculated easily as coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 the criterion then says that for cm @xmath18 mode @xmath27 is separable from modes @xmath56 if and only if @xmath57 holds . strictly speaking ,",
    "the criterion is not sufficient for separability of states having some symplectic eigenvalue equal to unity @xcite .",
    "however , the sharp inequality @xmath58 is already sufficient for separability .",
    "the original protocol for distribution of cv entanglement by separable gaussian states @xcite is depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( see figure caption for details ) . for this protocol",
    "the contours of the phase - space distributions of the input modes are shown as empty circle and ellipses .",
    "the essential ingredient of the protocol is a fully separable three - mode gaussian state @xmath59 that transforms appropriately under beam splitter operations on certain pairs of modes .",
    "more precisely , @xmath59 transforms under @xmath60 operation on modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 onto a state separable with respect to two bipartitions @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( two - mode biseparable state @xcite ) .",
    "this state further transforms under @xmath61 operation on modes @xmath7 and @xmath5 onto the state separable with respect to only one bipartition @xmath26 ( one - mode biseparable state @xcite ) .",
    "the construction of such a state is therefore the key nontrivial task that has to be solved in order to find the protocol .",
    "the requirements of the protocol are counterintuitive : by using locc and sending of a separable ancilla from alice to bob to create entanglement between them . as no entanglement",
    "is shared beforehand or sent by alice to bob , one can ask a natural question where the entanglement in the protocol comes from . in this original protocol",
    ", there is no a straightforward simple explanation for the emergence of entanglement , in particular due to the complex structure of the quantum states involved .",
    "for instance , the cms occurring in the protocol possess correlations between position and momentum quadratures and it is fairly possible that this kind of correlations is responsible for the phenomenon .",
    "similarly , it is not obvious which role is played by the squeezed state on bob s side and whether it has necessarily to be squeezed for the entanglement distribution to occur .    in the following section",
    "we show that neither of these properties accounts for the phenomenon . we construct a more simple protocol where all the participating states have zero correlations between position and momentum quadratures and where bob s mode",
    "is initially in the vacuum state ( which is a completely classical state ) .",
    "further , the new protocol exhibits a substantially better performance than the original one as it establishes entanglement between modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 with more than an order of the magnitude higher logarithmic negativity . finally , due to its simplicity",
    "the protocol gives a clear physical explanation of the counterintuitive phenomenon of entanglement distribution by separable states .",
    "in contrast to the original protocol @xcite where the fully separable state of step 1 was constructed first , we start with designing the state in step 2 . that is , by local operations on a pair of modes @xmath62 and mode @xmath7 and classical communication we construct a three - mode mixed gaussian state in which mode @xmath6 is entangled with modes @xmath63 , mode @xmath5 is separable from modes @xmath64 and mode @xmath7 is separable from modes @xmath62 .",
    "initially , we assume mode @xmath7 in the vacuum state and modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 in the two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "the corresponding cms read as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "the matrix @xmath67 has the lower symplectic eigenvalue equal to @xmath68 for @xmath69 and thus modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 are entangled .",
    "now we take the cm of the entire three - mode system , @xmath70 and we add to it a nonnegative multiple of a suitable positive noise matrix @xmath71 such that the state described by cm @xmath72 possesses entanglement between mode @xmath6 and modes @xmath63 while it is separable with respect to the other two bipartitions .",
    "the matrix @xmath71 can be found using the method developed in @xcite for construction of various three - mode entangled gaussian states .",
    "it utilizes a two - mode version of the separability criterion represented by eq .",
    "( [ criterion1 ] ) according to which a two - mode cm @xmath73 is entangled if and only if the matrix @xmath74 has a negative eigenvalue . by adding to the cm a sufficiently large positive multiple of sum of the projectors onto the subspaces spanned by real and imaginary parts of the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue we can destroy the entanglement between modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 . extending now the projectors suitably and adding a multiple of sum of the extensions to the cm @xmath75 we can finally construct a state with desired separability properties .",
    "the negative eigenvalue is easy to find and it reads as @xmath76 for @xmath69 and the corresponding eigenvector is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the sought noise matrix then can be constructed from the following @xmath80 extensions of the vectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 : @xmath83 as @xmath84 .",
    "the matrix is by construction positive and the addition of its sufficiently large nonnegative multiple @xmath85 to the cm ( [ gammaabc ] ) smears the initial entanglement between modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 such that @xmath6 is entangled with @xmath63 yet @xmath5 is separable from @xmath64 and , furthermore , @xmath7 is separable from @xmath62 .",
    "the separability of mode @xmath7 from the pair of modes @xmath62 is obvious as the cm ( [ tildegamma2a ] ) can be created from the product state with cm @xmath86 by local random correlated displacements distributed with gaussian distribution described by the correlation matrix @xmath85 .",
    "the threshold value @xmath87 of @xmath27 such that for @xmath88 the state with cm ( [ tildegamma2a ] ) is separable with respect to @xmath26 splitting can be found from the requirement of positivity of the partial transpose of the state described by cm ( [ tildegamma2a ] ) with respect to mode @xmath5 that is sufficient for separability of the @xmath89 system @xcite .",
    "the state has a positive partial transpose if and only if the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath90 , @xmath91 , of the matrix @xmath92 satisfy @xmath93 for all @xmath94 @xcite",
    ". the lowest symplectic eigenvalue reads @xmath95 and the threshold value @xmath87 can be calculated from the condition @xmath96 .",
    "after some algebra one can show that the cm ( [ tildegamma2a ] ) represents a state that is separable with respect to @xmath26 splitting if @xmath88 , where @xmath97 entanglement of mode @xmath6 with a pair of modes @xmath63 can be verified along the same lines .",
    "the lowest symplectic eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath98 attains the form : @xmath99 and for @xmath100 and @xmath69 it satisfies the inequality @xmath101 which proves the entanglement between @xmath6 and @xmath63 .",
    "note that this entanglement is essential for the performance of the studied protocol as the second beam splitter @xmath61 alone can not entangle mode @xmath6 with mode @xmath7 without @xmath6 being entangled with @xmath63 .    having found the desired cm of step 2 we can return back to step 1 by implementing the inverse of the balanced @xmath60 on modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "the beam splitter is described by the matrix @xmath102 and the inverse operation @xmath103 transforms the cm ( [ tildegamma2a ] ) as @xmath104 where the cm @xmath105 is the vacuum cm and @xmath106 are cms of the momentum and position squeezed vacuum states , respectively .",
    "the structure of cm ( [ tildegamma1 ] ) reveals that the state of step 1 can be created from the product of two orthogonally squeezed states and a vacuum state by local random displacements distributed according to the gaussian distribution with correlation matrix @xmath107 that has the following form : @xmath108 this implies immediately that the state is fully separable as is the basic requirement of our protocol .",
    "the improved protocol for distribution of cv entanglement by separable gaussian states is depicted in fig .",
    "the phase - space contours of the input modes for this protocol are represented by hatched circle and ellipses . as follows from the cm @xmath109 designed in eqs .",
    "( [ tildegamma1 ] ) and ( [ product ] ) , the input modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 are both in a squeezed state with reduced noise in two orthogonal quadratures respectively and mode @xmath7 is in a vacuum state . in the step 1 alice holding a pair of modes",
    "@xmath62 and bob holding mode @xmath7 prepare by locc a gaussian state characterized by the cm ( [ tildegamma1 ] ) . in the next step 2 , alice superimposes mode @xmath6 and @xmath5 on a balanced beam splitter @xmath60 .",
    "thus she creates a state with cm ( [ tildegamma2a ] ) that reads explicitly @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "as was shown above , the state is separable with respect to @xmath25 splitting and for @xmath88 , where @xmath87 is given in eq .",
    "( [ tildexsep ] ) , also with respect to @xmath26 splitting .    the protocol is finalized by step 3 in which bob mixes the mode @xmath5 received from alice with his mode @xmath7 on another balanced beam splitter @xmath61 described by the matrix @xmath113 the beam splitter transforms the cm ( [ tildegamma2b ] ) to cm @xmath114 that reads explicitly as @xmath115 where",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ tildegamma2b ] ) .",
    "the interference on the beam splitter @xmath61 finally entangles modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this can be seen by computing the lower symplectic eigenvalue @xmath116 of the matrix @xmath117 corresponding to the reduced state of modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we express the cm @xmath118 in the block form @xmath119 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath120 submatrices .",
    "the eigenvalue then reads as @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122^{2},\\nonumber\\\\ \\kappa&=&\\mbox{det}a+\\mbox{det}b-2\\mbox{det}c\\nonumber\\\\ & = & a^2+\\left(b+2x\\right)^2+\\frac{\\left(a+1\\right)^2}{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it can be used to quantify the amount of distributed entanglement by calculating the logarithmic negativity given by the formula @xmath123 @xcite . for @xmath69 and @xmath124 we get @xmath125 and therefore modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are entangled for an arbitrarily small nonzero squeezing .",
    "numerical analysis further reveals that the symplectic eigenvalue decreases monotonously with increasing squeezing and approaches the value of @xmath126 corresponding to @xmath127 ebits in the limit of infinite squeezing while all the separability properties of the states involved remain preserved . to illustrate this",
    ", we have calculated the output entanglement for some realistic values of squeezing using eqs .",
    "( [ absymplectic ] ) and ( [ abinvariants ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath128 corresponding to 3db of input squeezing results in the symplectic eigenvalue of @xmath129 which gives the logarithmic negativity of @xmath130 ebits . for @xmath131 corresponding to 10db squeezing that was recently achieved experimentally @xcite we get @xmath132 and @xmath133 ebits .",
    "it is interesting to compare the latter logarithmic negativity with the maximum logarithmic negativity that can be obtained with the original protocol @xcite .",
    "numerical optimization of the original protocol with respect to the noise parameter @xmath27 and the initial squeezings ( denoted by @xmath134 in @xcite ) reveals that the minimal lower symplectic eigenvalue of the partially transposed final entangled state distributed between alice and bob reads as @xmath135 and the corresponding logarithmic negativity is @xmath136 ebits .",
    "thus the logarithmic negativity of the entangled state created between distant locations in the improved protocol is more than an order of the magnitude higher than in the original protocol .",
    "furthermore , also in this improved protocol the mode @xmath5 remains separable from modes @xmath64 after the step 3 .",
    "this can be shown using the separability criterion based on symplectic invariants @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath128 the criterion gives @xmath137 which implies separability of mode @xmath5 from @xmath64 .",
    "the previous sections reveal that there indeed exist three - mode mixed gaussian fully separable states allowing to entangle two modes of the state by mixing them stepwise with the third always separable mode on two beam splitters .",
    "therefore , once such a tripartite state is established between distant alice and bob , they can create , without need of any additional knowledge , entanglement between them by sending a separable mode from one site to another remote location .",
    "there is , however , another interesting aspect in this protocol . when looking at the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one can imagine a different scenario when bob has some additional information about the preparation of the shared state . specifically , suppose that in each run of the protocol he knows classical displacements @xmath138 used to displace his vacuum mode @xmath7 .",
    "the natural question arises whether alice and bob can then create a higher entanglement than when using solely the shared fully separable state . in what follows",
    "we give an affirmative answer to this question by showing that they can in fact restore the whole amount of entanglement contained in the two - mode squeezed vacuum state with cm @xmath73 defined in eq .",
    "( [ gammaacgammab ] ) . moreover",
    ", here we provide an explanation where the entanglement comes from in the improved protocol depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "let us consider the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . there , the situation on alice s side remains the same as in the protocol in fig .",
    "bob , however , does not use an auxiliary vacuum mode @xmath7 appropriately displaced with @xmath139 to achieve the desired final cm .",
    "instead , he directly displaces mode @xmath5 received from alice with a suitable electronic gain @xmath140 .",
    "the cm of the resulting state is most easily calculated in heisenberg picture .",
    "let us denote by @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 position and momentum quadratures of initially vacuum modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively . arranging the quadratures of the squeezed vacuum modes @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath5 into the column vectors @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the quadratures of modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 after the displacements @xmath147 and @xmath148 read @xmath149 and @xmath150 , where the vectors @xmath151 and @xmath152 define classical displacements .",
    "next , the two modes are mixed on the balanced beam splitter @xmath60 .",
    "further , mode @xmath5 undergoes the displacement @xmath153 defined by the displacement vector @xmath154 of mode @xmath7 and @xmath120 gain matrix @xmath140 .",
    "this yields finally the transformed quadratures in the following form : @xmath155 here @xmath156 is the vector of quadratures of mode @xmath5 behind the beam splitter @xmath60 . to determine the final state of a two - mode subsystem @xmath62 , one has first to calculate the correlations @xmath157 , @xmath158 for modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively , and the intermodal correlations @xmath159 , @xmath160 , where the angle brackets denote averaging of the quantum quadrature operators over the quantum state with cm @xmath161 , where @xmath162 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ product ] ) and the classical displacements are averaged over the gaussian distribution with covariance ( [ tildeq ] ) .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ transform ] ) , cms ( [ product ] ) and the correlation matrix ( [ tildeq ] ) and taking into account the fact that the vectors of quantum quadratures @xmath163 are uncorrelated with the vectors of classical displacements @xmath164 and @xmath165 , we arrive at the cm of the state of modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 @xmath166 where @xmath167 where the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are defined below eq.([tildegamma2b ] ) .",
    "the structure of the cm indicates the optimal choice of the gain matrix @xmath140 .",
    "we see that by choosing @xmath168 the noise in the diagonal block @xmath5 cancels and the cm transforms to @xmath169 to characterize the separability properties of cm @xmath170 , it remains to calculate the lower symplectic eigenvalue @xmath171 for the matrix @xmath172 . using eq .",
    "( [ absymplectic ] ) one finds that it attains the simple form @xmath173 .",
    "hence we immediately see that the eigenvalue coincides with the lower symplectic eigenvalue @xmath174 of the partially transposed pure two - mode squeezed vacuum state with cm ( [ gammaacgammab ] ) that can be prepared by alice from her pure squeezed states .",
    "since any gaussian operation on mode @xmath5 can not increase the entanglement of the state with cm ( [ gamma2acb ] ) @xcite we see that bob s displacement on mode @xmath5 with the gain matrix @xmath175 is indeed an optimal gaussian operation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that while the entanglement of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state figuring in the protocol can be restored perfectly , the purity of the state can not because @xmath176 .",
    "previous analysis reveals the origin of the entanglement in the improved protocol in fig .",
    "the displacements @xmath147 and @xmath148 before the beam splitter @xmath60 can be transformed to another displacements @xmath177 and @xmath178 behind the beam splitter .",
    "consequently , the state of modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 behind the beam splitter can be viewed as a pure two - mode squeezed vacuum state with cm ( [ gammaacgammab ] ) .",
    "the entanglement and purity of this state is then subsequently destroyed by local correlated displacements @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the classical information on displacements @xmath179 and @xmath180 traveling to bob , that as we have seen allows him to perfectly restore the entanglement between modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 if he uses the protocol of fig .  [ fig3 ] , is instead used to displace his vacuum mode @xmath7 . mixing of the displaced vacuum mode @xmath7 with mode @xmath5 on the second balanced beam splitter @xmath61 leads finally to the following vector of bob s quadratures : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the vector of bob s vacuum quadratures and @xmath156 denotes the vector of quadratures of mode @xmath5 behind the beam splitter @xmath60 . compare the last equation with the equation for the vector of optimal quadratures @xmath183 obtained by setting @xmath168 in equation for @xmath184 in eqs .",
    "( [ transform ] ) .",
    "we find out that the vector of output bob s quadratures ( [ transformb ] ) is obtained from the vector of optimal quadratures by mixing it with the vector of vacuum quadratures of bob s mode on a balanced beam splitter described by eq .",
    "( [ ubc ] ) . thus , mixing of mode @xmath5 with mode @xmath7 on a beam splitter @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] implements effectively optimal displacement of mode @xmath5 restoring perfectly entanglement between modes @xmath6 and @xmath5 followed by mixing of the mode with the vacuum mode on a balanced beam splitter which reduces the amount of the entanglement .",
    "this finally explains the origin of the distributed entanglement in the improved protocol as well as the fact that it is weaker in comparison with the maximum entanglement that can be restored by bob using the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with optimal gain matrix @xmath175 .",
    "in conclusion , we performed a detailed investigation of the origin of entanglement in the protocol for entanglement distribution by separable gaussian states @xcite .",
    "for this purpose we proposed a more simple and efficient protocol that enables to distribute entanglement with more than an order of the magnitude higher logarithmic negativity than the older protocol @xcite .",
    "based on the new protocol we then found that the distributed entanglement originates from the entanglement of sender s mode with the auxiliary mode that is used for distribution .",
    "the entanglement is first destroyed by local correlated displacements that make the auxiliary mode separable from sender s mode . the separable mode",
    "is then sent to the receiver who partially restores the entanglement by mixing it with his suitably classically correlated mode .",
    "we emphasize that the proposed protocol for establishing entanglement between two remote parties using separable ancilla mode consists of experimentally feasible gaussian states and operations involving single - mode squeezed states , correlated displacements and beam splitters , dispensing with the technically challenging cnot gates of the qubit case .",
    "the input squeezed states with cms ( [ product ] ) need not to be minimum uncertainty states and the protocol works well also with states with a large noise excess in the antisqueezed quadratures , e.g. , for @xmath128 and @xmath185 vacuum units of noise excess in each quadrature the logarithmic negativity of the distributed entanglement is @xmath186 ebits compared to @xmath130 ebits for the minimum uncertainty states .",
    "the verification of the effect , however , can become an issue , as the possibility to demonstrate experimentally the proposed protocol crucially relies on our ability to check separability of mode @xmath5 from the pair of modes @xmath64 in step 2 . in theory we assumed gaussianity of states involved in the protocol .",
    "this enabled us to prove the separability using relatively simple sufficient conditions for separability of gaussian states @xcite . in an experiment , however , in order to check whether the state prepared by us is gaussian we would have to perform complete tomography of the state on infinite - dimensional state space which amounts to infinite number of measurements . in this sense",
    "the gaussian states are idealized limit states and for the experimental demonstration of the protocol we therefore need a sufficient condition for separability of a generic generally non - gaussian state or a reliable indication , that the gaussian character of the states is preserved throughout the protocol .",
    "nevertheless , a less ambitious goal can be achieved by measuring only the three - mode cm of the state in step 2 . by showing that the measured cm satisfies some gaussian sufficient condition for separability of mode @xmath5 from modes @xmath64 we know that the gaussian entanglement of modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 was distributed by sending an ancilla that was separable in gaussian sense .",

    "<S> we investigate the physical mechanism behind the counterintuitive phenomenon , the distribution of continuous - variable entanglement between two distant modes by sending a third separable auxiliary mode between them . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a new more simple and more efficient protocol resulting in distributed entanglement with more than an order of the magnitude higher logarithmic negativity than in the previously proposed protocol . </S>",
    "<S> this new protocol shows that the distributed entanglement originates from the entanglement of one mode and the auxiliary mode used for distribution which is first destroyed by local correlated noises and restored subsequently by the interference of the auxiliary mode with the second distant separable correlated mode . </S>"
