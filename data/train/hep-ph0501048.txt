    "the top quark is the heaviest known fermion with a mass close to the scale of the electroweak(ew ) symmetry breaking",
    ". therefore the study of its properties and the possible deviations from standard model ( sm ) predictions can probe varies physics beyond the sm .",
    "the tevatron run i has yielded relatively small numbers of top quark events .",
    "but the tevatron run ii can provide copious top quark events , and improve the precision of the top quark measurements , moreover , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the next - generation linear collider ( nlc ) will serve as top quark factories , and these machines should be very useful to obtain the information of new physics through analyzing the properties of the top quark decay , especially the study of the polarized properties of the decay products will be a good probe of new physics .",
    "the dominate decay mode of the top quark is @xmath2 , where the w boson as a decay product is strongly polarized with three helicity contents : transverse plus , transverse minus and longitudinal .",
    "the recent measurement of the top quark mass is @xmath3 gev  ( world  average)@xcite , which implies @xmath4 and the helicity of the w boson measured by cdf collaborations@xcite before the publication of @xcite is @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total width of @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the longitudinal and the transverse - plus widths , respectively .",
    "since the size of the longitudinal contribution encodes the physics of the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , and the transverse - plus contribution vanishes at the born - level , any sizable deviation from them may indicate obvious quantum effects or a non - sm ( v@xmath10a ) coupling in the weak @xmath11 current transition .",
    "therefore , the investigation of radiative corrections to the top decay into a polarized w boson may provide additional information about the new physics , and there has been a great of interests from theorists .",
    "so far theoretical predictions of these observables reported in the literatures are summarized as follows : the qcd corrections to the top width are rather large in general .",
    "one - loop qcd corrections to tree - level width are @xmath12  @xcite , one - loop electroweak corrections are @xmath13  @xcite and two - loop qcd corrections are approximate @xmath14  @xcite ( @xmath15  @xcite ) , and the one - loop susy - qcd and susy - ew corrections are below @xmath16 in magnitude for most of the parameter space@xcite . as for the partial longitudinal and transverse rates , for the top quark mass @xmath17 , the tree - level results are 0.703 for @xmath18 , 0.297 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , respectively . in the sm ,",
    "the @xmath22 qcd corrections decrease the rate @xmath18 by @xmath23 , increase the rate @xmath19 by @xmath24 and the rate @xmath21 reach mere @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the electroweak and finite width corrections increase the rate @xmath18 by @xmath26 , increase the rate @xmath19 by @xmath27 and the rate @xmath21 are only @xmath28@xcite . beyond the sm ,",
    "one - loop susy - qcd and susy - ew corrections to @xmath19 and @xmath18 are less than @xmath16 in magnitude and tend to have opposite signs@xcite .",
    "however , the r - parity violating susy contributions to @xmath2 have not been calculated so far . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the r - parity violating susy contributions to @xmath2 , including the total corrections , the longitudinal corrections and the transverse corrections , respectively .",
    "the most general superpotential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) consistent with the @xmath29 symmetry and supersymmetry contains r - violating interactions , which are given by@xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the left - handed lepton ( quark ) doublet and right - handed lepton ( quark ) singlet chiral superfields , and @xmath33 are the higgs chiral superfields .",
    "the indices @xmath34 denote generations and @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the color indices , and the superscript @xmath38 denotes charge conjugation .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the coupling constants of l(lepton number)-violating interactions and @xmath41 those of b(baryon number)-violating interactions .",
    "the non - observation ( so far ) of the proton decay imposes very strong constraints on the product of l - violating and b - violating couplings .",
    "it is thus conventionally assumed in the phenomenological studies that only one type of these interactions ( either l- or b - violating ) exists . some constraints on these r - parity violating couplings",
    "have been obtained from various analysis of their phenomenological implications based on experiments .",
    "it is notable that the bounds on the couplings involving top quark are generally quite weak . as the large number of top quarks",
    "will be produced at the future colliders , these couplings may either manifest themselves , or stronger constraints on them can be established . for the purpose of our work , we will focus on the quantum effects of r - parity violating couplings involved @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the top quark decay into polarized @xmath44 boson , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the sec.2 we present some formulas for our calculations , by which we can calculate the helicity amplitude of the top quark decays . in the sec.3",
    "we take a careful study on r - parity violating effects using the helicity method . in the sec.4",
    "we make a numerical analysis with drawing some conclusions for our calculations .",
    "the explicit expressions of the helicity amplitudes induced by the r - parity violating couplings are given in the appendix .",
    "in order to make our paper self - constrained , we start with a brief description of the helicity amplitude method for performing the following calculations .",
    "the method breaks down the algebra of four - dimensional dirac spinors and matrices into equivalent two - dimensional ones . in what follows",
    "we introduce the weyl representation of dirac spinors and matrices . in",
    "spherical coordinates the four - momemta can be written as @xmath45 .",
    "the left - hand ( l ) , right - hand ( r ) and longitudinal ( 0 ) polarization vectors for a spin-1 field are defined as @xcite @xmath46 the above equations satisfy the identities @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 or @xmath50 . in the weyl basis dirac spinors have the following four component forms @xmath51 for fermions ( with helicity @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 and for anti - fermions ( with helicity @xmath52 ) , @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath56 s are eigenvectors of the helicity operator @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the pauli matrices .",
    "we use the top rest frame , and one can write down these eigenvectors with eigenvalue @xmath39 ( for simplicity we take @xmath59 ) as @xmath60 where @xmath52 are for `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' , respectively . in the weyl basis takes the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 according to the above discussions , in the top rest frame we can write down the following expressions : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the four - dimensional momenta of the top quark and w boson , @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the left - hand ( l ) , right - hand ( r ) and longitudinal ( 0 ) polarization vectors of w boson , respectively .",
