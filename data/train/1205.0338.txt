    "the macroscopic magnetic properties of type - ii superconductors can to a large extent be described by the critical state model , first formulated by bean @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the magnitude of the current can not exceed the critical current density @xmath3 , thus limiting the ability of the superconductor to carry transport current or to shield applied magnetic fields .",
    "the original critical state model was formulated for bulk samples , but it has later been extended to thin films , where additional shielding currents @xmath4 flow in the region beyond the flux penetration front .",
    "analytical results have been found for an infinite strip @xcite and circular disk @xcite , while for less symmetric shapes or disconnected geometries the critical state has only been determined numerically @xcite .",
    "dynamics is disregarded in bean s critical state model , in the sense that the response to an applied magnetic field is instantaneous .",
    "in particular , the model does not take into account flux creep , a process acting in any real type - ii superconductor , and is particularly pronounced in high-@xmath5 superconductors . to model flux creep , time must be taken explicitly into consideration .",
    "conventionally , this is done by assuming a highly nonlinear @xmath6 relation before solving maxwell s equations . for thin films , the main obstacle for an efficient implementation of a numerical scheme ,",
    "is the handling of the boundary conditions , given the nonlocality of the governing equations .",
    "brandt has derived solutions for selected geometries , such as rectangles @xcite , disks and rings @xcite , or arbitrary shape @xcite , based on a matrix inversion method . although being accurate , these solutions scale poorly with system size and need @xmath7 operation for each time step , where @xmath8 is the number of discrete points in the spatial grid .",
    "better scaling properties can be obtained by the conjugate gradient method , which scales like @xmath9 @xcite or a hybrid real space - fourier space method scaling as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "one remarkable property of the bean model is that the current stream line pattern can be drawn simply by adding lines with constant spacing , starting from the contour of the sample edge .",
    "when there is a constriction , the stream lines must adapt by bending , which leads to formation of so called d - lines , i.e. , lines in the flow pattern where the stream lines change direction discontinuously .",
    "these d - lines are recognized also in the corresponding magnetic flux distribution , due to an almost total local suppression of the magnetic field in their vicinity . by examination of measured flux distributions , e.g. , obtained by magneto - optical imaging ( moi )",
    ", it has been found that the bean model to a large extent explains the flux penetration patterns of hard superconductors .",
    "for example , the d - line created by a circular nonconducting hole ( antidot ) is parabolic @xcite , a row of antidots give asymptotically straight d - lines at an angle given by the antidot fraction @xcite , while a convex right - angled corner , e.g. , as in a rectangular sample , gives straight d - lines making 45@xmath11 with the meeting edges @xcite .",

    ", width=321 ]    despite its vast success , the bean model procedure for drawing critical current stream - line patterns is ambiguous at a concave corner .",

    "the equidistant stream lines are straight and meet at a @xmath12 d - line , as in the case of a convex corner .",
    "in ( b ) the current stream lines consist partly of circular segments , and there are no traces of d - lines . the constructions ( a ) and ( b ) are just two out of infinitely many possible solutions that conserve current and give constant current density @xcite .",
    "however , only one construction can be correct , and to identify it a more comprehensive analysis must be made .",
    "schuster , kuhn and brandt @xcite investigated the flux and current distributions in a cross - shaped superconductor , a geometry that contains both convex and concave corners .",
    "their moi experiment showed no d - lines at the concave corners , hence excluding the sharp turn illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bean]a .",
    "an accompanying flux creep simulation gave stream lines close to circular , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bean]b .",
    "at the same time , a theoretical estimate showed that exactly circular stream lines diverge as @xmath13 close to the corner and the @xmath14-field will make a jump where the circular stream lines connect with the straight lines running parallel to the edges .",
    "as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite this is an indication that the stream line pattern is unphysical .",
    "thus , the stream lines at a concave corner can not be perfectly circular .",
    "gurevich and friesen @xcite calculated analytically the stream lines in the steady state using the powerful and general hodograph method .",
    "their solution showed that , in the limit of negligible flux creep , neither fig.[fig : bean ] ( a ) nor ( b ) are correctly representing the stream line pattern near a concave corner .",
    "however , their solution did not include the history of the magnetization process leading to the current distribution .",
    "neither did it include the specific non - locality effects crucially important in the transverse geometry .",
    "thus , it still remains an open question what is the correct current stream line pattern in a thin superconductor with a concave corner , and subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field .",

    "we also require that the external field @xmath16 is applied in the @xmath17-direction , transverse to the sample plane .",

    "[ fig : e - part ] , where the highest electrical field is @xmath110 giving a sheet current of @xmath117 , i.e. , a 5% increase in the current density .    notice also that the calculated stream lines begin to curve some distance before they meet the corner sector , thus the region of curves lines cover a sector wider than @xmath106 . in this way",
