    "numerical simulations , intensively used for more than two decades , have clearly shown that the global characteristics of the remnants of binary merger between two equal - mass spiral galaxies , called major mergers , resemble those of early - type galaxies ( _ i.e _ ellipticals & lenticulars ) , hereafter etgs @xcite .",
    "remnants with properties similar to etgs can also be recovered via multiple minor mergers with the total accreted mass being at least half of the initial mass of the main progenitor @xcite .",
    "this picture of the formation of etgs via accretion and merging of stellar bodies would fit well within the frame of the hierarchical assembly of galaxies provided by @xmath7cdm cosmology .    owing to large statistical samples",
    ", modern work tends to quantify in detail the properties of major and minor merger remnants , together with thorough comparisons with observed properties of etgs @xcite .",
    "it is , however , still difficult to build large samples of simulations with sufficiently high numerical resolution .",
    "many studies have indeed shown that the resolution affects the properties of the simulated objects , either in cosmological simulations @xcite or on simulations of star formation in mergers @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that a high - enough resolution is required to resolve properly the fluctuations of the gravitational potential during the merger , _",
    "i.e _ violent relaxation , which can significantly impact the morphology and kinematics of merger remnants .    in this paper",
    ", we further examine the role of the initial conditions ( impact parameter , incoming velocities , inclination and spins of the progenitors ) on the global characteristics of the remnants of binary galaxy mergers .",
    "we then propose to study the morphology and the kinematics of binary galaxy merger remnants simulated with a high numerical resolution . with that purpose in mind",
    ", we build two - dimensional momentum ( intensity , velocity and velocity dispersion ) maps of the merger remnants and analyse their apparent properties , directly linked with their orbital structures @xcite .",
    "using two - dimensional maps enables us to compare our merger remnants directly with modern spectroscopic observations of resolved local galaxies : the emergence of integral field spectrographs , such as the ` sauron ` spectrograph @xcite , allowed the mapping of local etgs up to about one effective radius .",
    "numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies or binary remergers are not necessarily representative of observed early - type galaxies @xcite but they are a powerful tool to constrain the formation mechanisms of different features observed in 2d maps of local galaxies like _ e.g. _ the formation of a kinematically distinct cores ( kdc ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the presence of gaseous discs ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the relation between nuclear black holes and the dynamics of the stars ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the formation of plumes , tails , stellar clusters at large radii , or giant gas rings @xcite .    the ` sauron ` survey @xcite has introduced a new view of etgs , classifying them in two families   the fast and the slow rotators   according not only to their morphology , but also to their kinematics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section  [ sec : physparam ] ) .",
    "these two classes are intrinsically different and seem to correspond to different populations of galaxies : while the fast rotators present regular rotation patterns aligned with the photometry , the slow rotators have low angular momentum and show misalignments between the photometry and the velocity axes .",
    "furthermore , slow rotators often exhibit kdcs , usually defined as a central stellar component with a rotation axis distinct from the outer stellar body ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "kdcs have been claimed to be a signature of a past interaction ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to further constrain the formation scenarios for these two classes , an ambitious program ",
    "atlas@xmath2   is being conducted , combining a multi - wavelength observational survey of a complete volume - limited sample of etgs with various numerical simulation and modelling efforts . the atlas@xmath2 project ( cappellari et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter paper i ) aims to quantify the distribution and kinematics of the stellar and gaseous components of a statistically significant sample of etgs to relate their detailed properties to their mass assembly , star formation history and evolution .",
    "krajnovi et al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter paper ii ) introduced new sub - classes within the slow rotator class : non - rotators which do not show any apparent sign of rotation , galaxies with a kdc when there is an abrupt change in the radial profile of the kinematical position angle ( @xmath8 ) , galaxies with non regular velocity pattern but with no noticeable kinematic feature , and the 2-@xmath6 galaxies characterised by two off - centred symmetric dispersion peaks along the major - axis .",
    "these so - called 2-@xmath6 galaxies are generally thought to have two stellar counter - rotating components ( _ i.e. _ a kdc at an 180@xmath9 away from the outer body ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for 2d - map examples of these counter - rotating components in simulations ) .    in the context of the atlas@xmath2 project , an extensive set of numerical simulations",
    "is being conducted to support the survey : cosmological simulations , semi - analytic modelling and idealized binary galaxy mergers . in the present study",
    ", we have simulated a substantial sample ( @xmath10 90 ) of binary mergers of disc galaxies and binary galaxy remergers at an unprecedented resolution , sufficient to properly follow the merging process and the resulting galaxy remnant @xcite .",
    "we aim to constrain the formation of the slow and fast rotators revealed by the ` sauron ` survey .",
    "for this purpose , we look at the morphology and the kinematics of the binary merger and remerger remnants and we link the initial conditions of the mergers to the formation of the fast and slow rotators as well as the formation of the kdcs . in section  [ sec : simus ] , we present the initial progenitor galaxies , which are spirals of hubble type sb and sc , and the different initial conditions of merging .",
    "we present in section  [ sec : binary ] the global properties of the merger remnants and the impact of the initial conditions : we thus show that the mass ratio , the angular momentum content and the hubble type of the progenitors play an important role in the formation of the slow and fast rotators and the kdcs . in section  [ sec : remergers ] , we analyse the remnants of galaxy remergers , these remnants are all classified as fast rotators or near the threshold for slow rotators and do not show any trace of a kdc .",
    "the formation mechanism of the kdcs via binary mergers of disc galaxies is presented in section  [ sec : kdc ] .",
    "we then discuss our results and compare it with previous studies ( section  [ sec : discu ] ) and with the observations of the 260 etgs of the atlas@xmath2 survey ( section  [ sec : compa ] ) .",
    "we then conclude and sum - up all our results in section  [ sec : conclu ] ."
