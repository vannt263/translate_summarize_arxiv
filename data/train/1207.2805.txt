    ", see the recent chen , goldstein and shao @xcite and ross @xcite for an overview ; maximum entropy characterizations are closely related to the development of important tools in information theory ( see akaike @xcite ) , bayesian probability theory ( see jaynes  @xcite ) or even econometrics ( see wu @xcite , park and bera @xcite ; characterizations of probability distributions by means of order statistics are , according to teicher  @xcite , `` harbingers of [  ] characterization theorems '' , and have been extensively studied around the middle of the twentieth century by the likes of kac , kagan , linnik , lukacs or rao ; cramr - type characterizations are currently the object of active research , see bourguin and tudor @xcite .",
    "this list is by no means exhaustive and for further information about characterization theorems as a whole , we refer to the extensive and still relevant monograph kagan , linnik and rao @xcite , or to kotz @xcite , bondesson @xcite , haikady @xcite and the references therein .    in this paper , we focus on a family of characterization theorems which lie at the intersection between probabilistic and statistical characterizations , the so - called _",
    "mle characterizations_.      we call mle characterization the characterization of a ( family of ) probability distribution(s ) via the structure of the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) of a certain parameter of interest ( location , scale , etc . ) .",
    "the first occurrence of such a theorem is in gauss @xcite , where gauss showed that the normal ( a.k.a .",
    "the gaussian ) is the only location family for which the sample mean @xmath4 is `` always '' the mle of the location parameter .",
    "more specifically , gauss @xcite proved that , in a location family @xmath5 with differentiable density @xmath6 , the mle for @xmath7 is the sample mean for all samples @xmath8 of all sample sizes @xmath9 if , and only if , @xmath10 for @xmath11 some constant and @xmath12 the adequate normalizing constant .",
    "discussed as early as in poincar @xcite , this important result , which we will throughout call _ gauss mle characterization _ , has attracted much attention over the past century and has spawned a spree of papers about mle characterization theorems , the main contributions ( extensions and improvements on different levels , see below ) being due to teicher @xcite , ghosh and rao @xcite , kagan , linnik and rao @xcite , findeisen @xcite , marshall and olkin @xcite and azzalini and genton @xcite .",
    "( see also hrlimann @xcite for an alternative approach to this topic . ) for more information on gauss original argument , we refer the reader to the accounts of hald @xcite , pages 354 and 355 , and chatterjee @xcite , pages 225227 .",
    "see norden @xcite or the fascinating stigler @xcite for an interesting discussion on mles and the origins of this fundamental concept .",
    "the successive refinements of gauss mle characterization contain improvements on two distinct levels .",
    "firstly , several authors have worked towards weakening the regularity assumptions on the class of distributions considered ; for instance , gauss requires differentiability of @xmath6 , while teicher @xcite only requires continuity .",
    "secondly , many authors have aimed at lowering the sample size necessary for the characterization to hold ( i.e. , the `` always''-statement ) ; for instance , gauss requires that the sample mean be mle for the location parameter for _ all _ sample sizes simultaneously , teicher @xcite only requires that it be mle for samples of sizes 2 and 3 at the same time , while azzalini and genton @xcite only need that it be so for a single fixed sample size @xmath13 .",
    "note that azzalini and genton @xcite also construct explicit examples of non - gaussian distributions for which the sample mean is the mle of the location parameter for the sample size @xmath14 .",
    "we already draw the reader s attention to the fact that azzalini and genton s @xcite result does not supersede teicher s @xcite , since the former require more stringent conditions ( namely differentiability of the @xmath6 s ) than the latter . we will provide a more detailed discussion on this interesting fact again at the end of section [ secloc ] . aside from these `` technical '' improvements , the literature on mle characterization theorems also contains evolutions in different directions which have resulted in a new stream of research , namely that of discovering new ( i.e. , different from gauss mle characterization ) mle characterization theorems .",
    "these can be subdivided into two categories .",
    "on the one hand , mle characterizations with respect to the location parameter but for other forms than the sample mean have been shown to hold for densities other than the gaussian .",
    "on the other hand , mle characterizations with respect to other parameters of interest than the location parameter have also been considered .",
    "teicher @xcite shows that if , under some regularity assumptions and for _ all _ sample sizes , the mle for the scale parameter of a scale target distribution is the sample mean @xmath15 then the target is the exponential distribution , while if it corresponds to the square root of the sample arithmetic mean of squares @xmath16 , then the target is the standard normal distribution .",
    "following suit on teicher s work , kagan , linnik and rao @xcite establish that the sample median is the mle for the location parameter for all samples of size @xmath17 if and only if the parent distribution is the laplace law .",
    "also , in ghosh and rao @xcite , it is shown that there exist distributions other than the laplace for which the sample median at @xmath14 or @xmath18 is mle .",
    "ferguson @xcite generalizes teicher s @xcite location - based mle characterization from the gaussian to a one - parameter generalized normal distribution , and marshall and olkin @xcite generalize teicher s @xcite scale - based mle characterization of the exponential distribution to the gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath19 by replacing @xmath15 as mle for the scale parameter with @xmath20 .",
    "there also exist contributions by buczolich and szkely @xcite where they investigate situations in which a weighted average of ordered sample elements can be an mle of the location parameter .",
    "mle characterizations in the multivariate setup have been proposed , inter alia , in marshall and olkin @xcite and azzalini and genton @xcite . in parallel to all these `` linear '' mle characterizations there have also been a number of developments regarding mle characterizations for spherical distributions , that is distributions taking their values only on the unit hypersphere in higher dimensions , see duerinckx and ley @xcite and the references therein .    finally , there exists a different stream of mle characterization research , inspired by poincar  @xcite , in which one relaxes the assumptions made on the role of the parameter @xmath7 and seeks to understand the conditions under which the mle for this @xmath7 is an arithmetic mean .",
    "this approach to mle characterization theorems is known as _ gauss principle _ ; quoting campbell @xcite `` _ _ by gauss principle we shall mean that a distribution should be chosen so that the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter @xmath7 is the same as the arithmetic mean estimate given by @xmath21 _ _ '' , with @xmath22 for some known function @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath23 is the identity function and one considers one - parameter location families then we recover the mle characterization problem solved by gauss @xcite . for general one - parameter families",
    "the corresponding problem was solved in poincar @xcite .",
    "campbell @xcite broadens poincar s conclusion to general functions @xmath23 and to the multivariate setup , while bondesson @xcite further extends the above works to exponential families with nuisance parameters . as pointed out by their authors ,",
    "many of these results remain valid for discrete distributions ; for other mle characterizations of discrete probability laws , we also refer to puig @xcite and puig and valero @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable application of mle characterizations is to be found in the very origins of this field of study , whose forefathers sought to define families of probability distributions which were `` natural '' for a given important problem .",
    "for instance , the gaussian distribution was uncovered by gauss through his effort of finding the location family for which the sample mean @xmath15 is a most probable value for @xmath7 , the location parameter .",
    "similarly , poincar in his `` calcul des probabilits '' ( 2nd ed . , 1912 )",
    "derived in chapter 10 ( pages 147168 in the 1896 edition ) a particular case of the _ exponential families of distributions _ ( see lehmann and casella @xcite , section 1.5 ) by asking for which distributions @xmath15 is the mle of @xmath7 , without specifying the role of the parameter .",
    "we refer to the historical remarks at the end of bondesson @xcite and the references therein for more information on both the works of gauss and poincar .",
    "following gauss ideas , von mises @xcite defined the circular ( i.e. , spherical in dimension two ) analogue of the gaussian distribution by looking for the circular distribution whose circular location parameter always has the circular sample mean as mle ; this led to the now famous _ fisher  von mises  langevin _ ( abbreviated fvml ) distribution on spheres .    of an entirely different nature is campbell s @xcite use of mle characterizations . in his paper",
    ", campbell establishes an equivalence between mle characterizations in the spirit of gauss principle and the minimum discrimination information estimation of probabilities .",
    "more recently , puig @xcite has applied mle characterizations in order to characterize the harmonic law as the only statistical model on the positive real half - line that satisfies a certain number of requirements . as a last example",
    ", we cite the work of ley and paindaveine @xcite who solved a long - standing problem on skew - symmetric distributions through an argument resting on gauss mle characterization .      as is perhaps intuitively clear , many of the results on mle characterizations stem from a common origin . as a matter of fact",
    "many authors often follow the same `` smart path '' that can be summarized in three steps : ( a ) choose the role of the parameter of interest @xmath7 ( location or scale ) ; ( b ) choose a remarkable form for the mle for @xmath7 ( e.g. , sample mean , variance or median ) ; ( c ) use the freedom of choice in the samples as well as the sample size ( two samples of respective sizes 2 and 3 , one sample of size 3 , all samples of all sizes@xmath24 ) to obtain the largest class of distributions satisfying certain assumptions ( continuous at a single point , continuous , differentiable@xmath24 ) which share this specific mle . while similar , the arguments leading to the different results nevertheless are largely ad hoc and rest upon crafty manipulations of the explicit given form of the mle",
    ". moreover , step ( c ) contains assumptions on the minimal sample size and on the properties of the distributions being characterized , the necessity of which is barely addressed .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to unify this important literature by explaining the mechanism behind this `` smart path '' in the more general context of one - parameter _ group families _ ( as defined in section [ secother - parameters ] ) although still with particular focus on location and scale families . in doing so",
    ", we will introduce the concept of minimal covering sample size ( mcss ) , a quantity whose value depends on the structure of the support of the target distribution and from which one deduces the a priori minimal necessary sample size ( mnss ) at which an mle characterization holds for a given family of distributions ( see duerinckx and ley @xcite where this notion was introduced ) .",
    "as we shall see , the mcss and mnss explain many of the differences in the `` always''-statements appearing throughout the literature on mle characterization .",
    "moreover our unified perspective on mle characterizations not only permits to identify the minimal sufficient conditions under which group families are characterized by their mles ( mle - characterizable ) but also provide tools for ( easily ) constructing new mle characterizations of many important families of distributions .    in a nutshell , our goal is to ( i ) propose a unified perspective on mle characterizations for one - parameter group families , ( ii ) answer the question of which such families are mle - characterizable and find their mnss , ( iii ) retrieve , improve on and better understand existing results via our general analysis , and ( iv ) construct new mle characterization results .",
    "our contribution to the important literature on mle characterizations unifies the cornerstone references teicher @xcite , ferguson @xcite , kagan , linnik and rao @xcite , marshall and olkin @xcite , azzalini and genton @xcite ( to cite but these ) and complements the understanding brought by the seminal works of poincar @xcite , campbell @xcite and bondesson @xcite .      in section [ notations ]",
    "we describe the framework of our study , give all necessary notations and introduce the so - called _ equivalence classes_. in section [ secminim - necess - sample ] we establish and interpret the above - mentioned notion of mcss which will be central to this paper . in section [ secloc ]",
    ", we derive the mle characterization for univariate location families , while in section [ secscale ] we proceed in a similar way with univariate scale families . in section",
    "[ secother - parameters ] we obtain mle characterizations for general one - parameter group families , allowing us to study other roles of the parameter ( e.g. , skewness ) . in section [ appl ]",
    "we apply our findings to particular families of distributions .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion , in section [ secdiscu ] , of the different possible extensions that are yet to be explored .",
    "throughout we consider observations @xmath25 that are sampled independently from a distribution @xmath26 ( with density @xmath27 ) which we suppose to be entirely known up to a parameter @xmath28 . the true parameter value @xmath29 is estimated by ml estimation on basis of @xmath30 . as explained in the , our aim consists in determining which classes of distributions are identifiable by means of the mle of the parameter of interest @xmath7 , a parameter that can , in principle , be of any nature ( i.e. , location , scale , etc . ) . on the target family of distributions @xmath31",
    "we make the following general assumptions :    1 .",
    "( a1 ) the parameter space @xmath32 contains an open set @xmath33 of which the true parameter @xmath34 is an interior point .",
    "2 .   ( a2 ) for each @xmath35 , the distribution @xmath26 has support @xmath36 independent of @xmath7 .",
    "( a3 ) for all @xmath37 the random variable @xmath38 has a density @xmath39 with respect to the ( dominating ) lebesgue measure .",
    "( a4 ) for @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 .",
    "these assumptions are taken from lehmann and casella @xcite , page 444 .",
    "[ remark1 ] although typically we will be concerned with either _ location families _ with densities of the form @xmath42 for @xmath43 the location parameter , or _",
    "scale families _ with densities of the form @xmath44 for @xmath45 the scale parameter , other roles for @xmath7 ( skewness , tail behavior  ) can also be considered ; see section [ secother - parameters ] where we detail our approach for one - parameter group families .    while throughout the paper we restrict our attention to the univariate setting , it is easy to see that our arguments are in some cases transposable word - by - word to the multivariate case .",
    "we discuss this matter briefly in section [ secdiscu ] .",
    "assumption ( a2 ) implies that only densities with full support @xmath46 may be considered for ml estimation of a location parameter , while only densities with support either @xmath46 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 may be considered for ml estimation of a scale parameter . despite the fact that these restrictions are natural in the present context they can ,",
    "if deemed necessary , be lifted .",
    "we will briefly discuss this topic in section [ secdiscu ] .",
    "we define , for a fixed sample size @xmath49 , the mle of the parameter @xmath7 as ( if it exists ) the measurable function @xmath50 for which @xmath51 for all @xmath35 and all samples @xmath52 of size @xmath9 .",
    "it is not trivial to provide minimal conditions on @xmath27 under which @xmath53 exists , is uniquely defined and satisfies the necessary measurability conditions .",
    "consistency of the mle is also a delicate matter and further regularity conditions are required for the problem to make sense . as in cramr",
    "@xcite one may suppose that , for almost all @xmath54 , the density @xmath55 is differentiable with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "this allows to define the mle as the solution of the local likelihood equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the _ score function _ of the density @xmath27 associated with the parameter @xmath7 ( we set this function to 0 outside the support of @xmath27 ) .",
    "the solution to ( [ eqmleneflocal ] ) has , at least asymptotically , the required properties ( see lehmann and casella @xcite , theorem 6.3.7 ) .",
    "furthermore , this way of proceeding allows for a simple sufficient condition for uniqueness of the mle : the mapping @xmath58 has to be strictly monotone and to cross the @xmath54-axis .",
    "note that this requirement coincides with _ strong unimodality _ or _ log - concavity _ of the density @xmath27 when @xmath7 is a location parameter ( see lehmann and casella @xcite , exercise 6.3.15 ) .",
    "although in general there is no explicit expression for the mle of a given parametric family , there exist several important distributions that not only satisfy all the above requirements but also allow for mles which take on a remarkable form . taking @xmath59 the standard normal density ,",
    "the mle for the location parameter is @xmath60 , the sample arithmetic mean , while that for the scale parameter is @xmath16 , the square root of the sample arithmetic mean of squares .",
    "taking @xmath27 the exponential density , the mle for the scale parameter becomes @xmath15 .    as outlined in section [ secpurpose - paper ] ,",
    "our objective in this paper is to determine minimal conditions under which a given form of mle for a given type of parameter identifies a specific probability distribution .",
    "upon making this statement there immediately arises a trivial identification problem ( due to our definition of maximum likelihood estimators ) which we first need to evacuate .",
    "indeed if @xmath61 maximizes the @xmath27-likelihood function , then it also maximizes the @xmath6-likelihood function for any function @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 a normalizing constant .",
    "in fact , from our definitions ( [ eqmlenef ] ) and ( [ eqmleneflocal ] ) , it is immediate that any two parametric densities @xmath65 and @xmath66 with same support @xmath36 and such that @xmath67 for some @xmath63 share the same mle for @xmath7 .",
    "this seemingly trivial and innocuous observation leads us to the introduction of a concept that happens to be fundamental for this paper and for mle characterizations in general : the concept of ( parameter - dependent ) equivalence classes ( e.c . hereafter ) , meaning that two densities are equivalent if their score functions satisfy ( [ scoreeq ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that e.c.s constitute a partition of the space of distributions .",
    "stated simply , without further conditions or specifications on the density associated with the target distribution @xmath26 ( the target density @xmath27 ) and on the functions @xmath6 , mle characterization theorems identify an e.c . of distributions rather than a single well - specified distribution .",
    "considering , for example , gauss mle characterization , both teicher @xcite and azzalini and genton @xcite , to cite but these , identify the gaussian distribution with respect to its location parameter only up to an unknown variance . on the contrary ,",
    "when dealing with scale characterizations , teicher @xcite imposes a tail - constraint in order to be able to single out the standard exponential and the standard gaussian distribution .",
    "the use of e.c.s are far from new in the context of ml estimation .",
    "indeed daniel bernoulli , who is considered to be one of the first authors to introduce the idea underlying the concept of maximum likelihood , noted as early as in 1778 that the roots of his `` likelihood function '' would not change by squaring the semi - circular density he used ( see stigler @xcite , chapter 16 ) .",
    "further ideas of bernoulli can be found in kendall @xcite , section 19 , and they clearly demonstrate that the equivalence ( [ scoreeq ] ) can be viewed as a modern expression of bernoulli s early thoughts .    in what follows , we shall state our results in the most general possible way , without ( at least in the main results ) considering additional identification constraints . as will become clear from the subsequent sections , the nature of the parameter of interest @xmath7 heavily influences the partition of the space of distributions , so that , for each type of parameter , one needs to identify the e.c.s ( see the beginnings of sections [ secloc ] and [ secscale ] for an illustration ) .",
    "the framework we have developed so far allows us to reformulate the question underpinning the present article in a more transparent form , namely `` _",
    "_ do there exist two distinct e.c.s @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that the distributions @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 share a given mle of the parameter of interest @xmath7 _ _ '' ? as is perhaps already clear , the answer to this question is negative   at least in the interesting cases . to see why this ought to be the case let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be two e.c.s which share an mle for some sample size @xmath49 , in other words suppose that , for some @xmath49 , some @xmath74 and some @xmath73 , the estimator @xmath75 coincides with @xmath76 , that is , @xmath77 for all @xmath35 and all samples @xmath52 of size @xmath9 .",
    "then clearly the only way for @xmath27 and @xmath6 to satisfy ( [ eqmlenefg ] ) for all samples of size @xmath9 is that they be strongly related to one another ; as we will see , under reasonable conditions , one can go one step further and deduce that if ( [ eqmlenefg ] ) holds true for a `` sufficiently large @xmath9 '' then @xmath27 and @xmath6 must belong to the same e.c .",
    "this intuition is the heart of all the literature on mle characterizations .",
    "the first step towards establishing our general mle characterizations is to gain a better understanding of the meaning of `` sufficiently large @xmath9 '' for ( [ eqmlenefg ] ) to induce a characterization theorem .",
    "we use the notation @xmath78 to denote the hyperplane @xmath79 and associate , with any parametric distribution @xmath26 satisfying the requirements of section [ notations ] , the collection(s ) of sets @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the @xmath9-fold cartesian product of @xmath82 , the support of the target @xmath27 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the interplay between the sets @xmath83 and the hyperplanes @xmath84 determines the minimal sample size @xmath9 for a characterization theorem to hold .",
    "the following lemma is crucial to our approach .",
    "[ lemmalem2 ] suppose that for some @xmath35 the mapping @xmath85 is strictly monotone over some interval @xmath86 and that the ( restricted ) image @xmath87 is of the form @xmath88 , for positive constants @xmath89 ( possibly infinite ) .",

    "consequently , theorem [ theosca2 ] applies and yields the ( to the best of our knowledge ) first scale mle characterization of the logistic distribution , with infinite mnss .      as a final example",
    ", we consider the sinh ",
    "arcsinh skew - normal distribution of jones and pewsey @xcite whose density is given by @xmath430 where @xmath431 is a skewness parameter regulating the asymmetric nature of the distribution .",
    "clearly , for @xmath432 , corresponding to the symmetric situation , one retrieves the standard normal distribution .",
    "now , straightforward but tedious calculations provide us with expressions for @xmath143 and @xmath304 which can both be seen to be non - invertible .",
    "hence , no location - based nor scale - based characterizations can be obtained .",
    "however , the sinh ",
    "arcsinh skew - normal distribution can be characterized @xmath433 its skewness parameter .",
    "as shown in section [ secother - parameters ] , the sinh ",
    "arcsinh transform belongs to the class of transforms leading to group families .",
    "consequently , its skewness score function is given by @xmath434 with @xmath316 the standard gaussian density .",
    "this mapping is invertible over @xmath46 with symmetric image  @xmath46 .",
    "theorem [ theoh ] therefore applies and yields the ( to the best of our knowledge ) first mle characterization of the sinh ",
    "arcsinh skew - normal distribution ( with respect to its skewness parameter ) with an mnss equal to 3 .",
    "in this article , we have provided a unified treatment of the topic of mle characterizations for one - parameter group families of absolutely continuous distributions satisfying certain regularity conditions .",
    "a natural question of interest is then in how far our methodology can be adapted to other distributions which do not satisfy these assumptions .",
    "of particular interest are ( i ) parametric families whose score function is either not invertible or not differentiable at a countable number of points ( such as , e.g. , the laplace distribution w.r.t .",
    "its location parameter ) , ( ii ) families depending on more than one parameter and ( iii ) discrete families .",
    "although we will not cover these questions in full here , we conclude the paper by providing a number of intuitions on these questions ; in all cases it seems clear that our methodology provides  at least in principle  the path towards a satisfactory answer .",
    "regarding the first point , an interesting issue to investigate is how the non - invertibility of the score function influences the mnss .",
    "indeed in the case of a laplace target the mnss is known to be equal to 4 ( see ghosh and rao @xcite , kagan , linnik and rao  @xcite ) .",
    "this increase is due to the fact that the laplace score function only takes on two distinct non - zero values so that having ( [ mleeqloc ] ) for three sample points forces one of the observations to be 0 ( otherwise the equality can not hold ) and therefore the case @xmath18 provides no more information than the case @xmath14 ( and thus @xmath435 ) .",
    "it would of course be interesting to understand the influence of the number of distinct values taken by a given score function on the corresponding mnss .",
    "one would , moreover , need to deal in this case with commensurability issues in order for the corresponding identity ( [ mleeqloc ] ) to hold ; this would most certainly lead to interesting discussions . aside from these issues , however , the question of characterizability is , to the best of our understanding , covered by our approach ( see the end of section [ secloc ] ) .",
    "regarding the second point , it seems straightforward ( but clearly requires some care ) to extend our method to a multi - dimensional location parameter , as is already done in marshall and olkin @xcite for a gaussian target density . in a nutshell",
    ", it suffices to project the now multi - dimensional location score function onto distinct - directional unit vectors and then proceed `` as in the univariate case '' . on the contrary ,",
    "dealing with a high - dimensional scale parameter seems more difficult , as the scale parameter becomes a matrix - valued scatter or shape parameter .",
    "one possibility could be to try to adapt marshall and olkin s @xcite working scheme , who have been able to provide an mle characterization for the scatter parameter of a multinormal distribution .",
    "along these lines a final issue that we have not considered is that of mle characterizations of univariate target distributions with respect to multivariate parameters ( such as the gaussian in terms of its two parameters @xmath436 ) . in support of our optimism for these multivariate setups ,",
    "see duerinckx and ley @xcite where our methodology was successfully applied to the ( perhaps more complex ) case of the spherical location parameter families .",
    "finally concerning the discrete setup , it seems clear that our approach again yields in principle a satisfactory answer for discrete group families , although this will require a certain amount of work .",
    "we defer the systematic treatment of this interesting question to later publications .",
    "we conclude this paper by an intriguing question suggested by an anonymous referee , which is the following : do characterization results survive mixtures of distributions ? more concretely , if a given distribution is mle - characterizable a given parameter of interest , under which conditions will mixtures of this distribution remain mle - characterizable ?",
    "this question is all but straightforward to answer .",
    "indeed , we have seen in section [ appl ] that the student distribution is only characterizable its scale parameter , whereas the logistic distribution admits an mle characterization both the location and scale parameter ; the student and the logistic distribution are both scale mixtures of the gaussian distribution , which is mle - characterizable both as a location and scale family .",
    "we leave this question as an open problem .",
    "all three authors thank johan segers and davy paindaveine for their interesting comments during presentations of preliminary versions of this paper .",
    "the authors are also very grateful to two anonymous referees for extremely interesting remarks and suggestions that have led to a definite improvement of the present paper .",
