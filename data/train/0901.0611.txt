    "the ri - beam facilities in the new generation will increase significantly the number of experimentally accessible nuclei , especially in medium and heavy mass regions .",
    "we may reach nuclei close to the neutron drip - line in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 region , where a bunch of deformed neutron - rich nuclei are expected@xcite .",
    "this will provide us with a new opportunity to study interplay among the presence of weakly bound neutrons , the coupling to nuclear deformation effects , the pairing correlation , and the collective excitations .    a promising theoretical framework to describe",
    "this situation may be the self - consistent mean - field approaches.@xcite more specifically , we consider here the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method to construct the pair - correlated and deformed ground state , and the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) to describe the excitation modes built on the ground state .",
    "as commonly recognized , one has to describe precisely the nucleon wave function of weakly bound and unbound orbits , which should have proper asymptotic behaviours .",
    "there exist such formulations for spherical nuclei,@xcite but a new challenge here is that we have to do it for deformed nuclei .",
    "a method using the pschel - teller - ginocchio basis is proposed recently@xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle motion in deformed woods - saxon potential is analyzed in detail in the coupled - channel formalism.@xcite we here take a slightly different approach based on the coordinate - space green s function technique since we plan to apply it also to the continuum qrpa@xcite . in the present work , we shall show that the coordinate - space green s function technique enables us to formulate the deformed continuum hfb method in which the nucleon waves satisfy a proper boundary condition of the asymptotic out - going wave .",
    "we first describe the quasi - particle motion in the hfb mean - fields consisting of the particle - hole field and the pair field which are both deformed . the axial symmetry is assumed .",
    "the quasiparticles of the bogoliubov type have two - component wave functions @xmath2 , for which we use the radial coordinate system and the partial wave expansion @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the spin spherical harmonics .",
    "the hfb equation is then written as a coupled - channel schrdinger equations@xcite for the radial wave functions @xmath6 where the quantum number @xmath7 represents the `` channel '' .",
    "note that the energy spectrum of the quasiparticle consists of discrete and continuum parts , which are separated by the energy condition @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the fermi energy ) as is in the spherical case.@xcite    we can construct the exact green s function for the quasiparticle motion in our deformed hfb problem .",
    "it is an extension of the spherical theory of ref.@xcite to deformed cases , and we accomplished this by employing a general prescription@xcite of constructing the exact green s function for a deformed potential scatterer . here the hfb green s function ( a @xmath11 matrix form combining the normal and abnormal functions ) is expanded as @xmath12 the coupled - channel radial green s function @xmath13 is constructed as a linear combination of products of `` regular solutions '' @xmath14 ( i.e. those satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath15 at the origin @xmath16 ) and `` out - going wave solutions '' @xmath17 ( those connected to the proper asymptotic form @xmath18 for @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the out - going hankel function ) .",
    "we calculate the density @xmath21 and the pair density @xmath22 using the hfb green s function thus constructed .",
    "the generalized density matrix @xmath23 which is a sum of the wave functions of all the quasiparticle states including the continuum states , is calculated using a contour integral of the hfb green s function@xcite . incorporating this way of calculating densities into the standard iterative algorithm , we obtain the hfb ground state after convergence .",
    "we shall demonstrate with numerical examples how the deformed continuum hfb works .",
    "we adopt for simplicity a deformed woods - saxon potential as the particle - hole field , but we perform the hfb iteration to obtain the selfconsistent pair field .",
    "we use the density - dependent delta interaction ( dddi ) acting in the singlet pair , @xmath24 ( for neutrons ) where @xmath25 is fixed to reproduce the @xmath26-scattering length @xmath27 fm .",
    "we consider @xmath28 mg and assume a deformation @xmath29 . using the runge - kutta - nystrom method we solve numerically the coupled - channel equation within an interval @xmath30 $ ] ( @xmath31 fm ) with a step size @xmath32 fm . at the outer boundary",
    "the wave functions are connected to the asymptotic forms .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is chosen to produce the neutron pairing gap around @xmath34 mev .",
    "the cut - off in the quasiparticle energy is 60 mev , and the maximum @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) quantum number is @xmath37 . for comparison",
    ", we performed also the hfb calculation using the same model but with a box boundary condition assuming an infinite wall at @xmath38 . in the following",
    "we show results for neutrons .",
    "figure 1 shows the radial profile of the monopole and quadrupole parts @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the neutron density @xmath41 , and the corresponding @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the neutron pair density @xmath22 .",
    "we obtain exponential asymptotics here thanks to the proper boundary condition , and it is in contrast to the results obtained with the box boundary condition ( the dashed curves in fig.1 ) . @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath40 have the same exponential slope , indicating that we can define the deformation of the equi - density surfaces in the asymptotic region .",
    "this kind of deformed exponential tail is also seen in the neutron pair density .",
    "but the ratio of @xmath43 against @xmath42 is significantly smaller than that of the normal density .",
    "this points to that the pair density in the tail has smaller deformation than that of the normal density .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum above the threshold energy @xmath44 should be continuous , and it is indeed the case in our formulation .",
    "figure 2 shows the occupation number density @xmath45 and the pair number density @xmath46 which are defined by @xmath47 they quantify contributions of the quasiparticle state at energy @xmath48 to the neutron number @xmath49 and to @xmath50 . here",
    "is shown only for the neutron @xmath51 states .",
    "the smoothing parameter is chosen to @xmath52 kev ( a discrete state would have artificial fwhm=50 kev ) .    in this numerical example",
    "there is no discrete quasiparticle states below @xmath53 ( @xmath54 kev ) , and all the quasiparticle states are embedded in the continuum @xmath55 .",
    "the quasiparticle states corresponding to deep hole woods - saxon orbit appear both in @xmath45 and @xmath46 as narrow resonances .",
    "it is observed also that the non - resonant continuum states have a significant contribution to the pair number density @xmath46 .",
    "this figure shows also that the box - discretized calculation has difficulty to describe the non - resonant continuum states .",
    "the lowest energy resonance is not described well by a single state in the box - discretized calculation , and it is because this resonance has a rather large width .",
    "this resonance corresponds to the @xmath56\\frac{1}{2}$ ] orbit in the deformed woods - saxon potential , which is , in the absence of the pairing , a bound state with the single - particle energy @xmath57 kev .",
    "naturally we expect most dramatic effect of the weak binding on this state .",
    "the inset shows how the spectrum @xmath46 changes when the depth of the woods - saxon potential is artificially shifted ( made shallower ) by 2 mev .",
    "the woods - saxon single - particle energy @xmath58 and the fermi energy @xmath10 changes from @xmath59 kev to @xmath60 kev .",
    "we see in the inset of fig.2 a dramatic increase in the width of the lowest - energy resonance , which apparently originates from the weak binding .",
    "note however that the peak energy of the resonance stays almost constant .",
    "this implies that the effective pairing gap of this resonant quasiparticle state is unchanged , if we estimate the effective pairing gap through the relation @xmath61 .",
    "this observation is different from that in ref.@xcite claiming a reduction of the effective pairing gap due to the weak binding effect .",
    "the difference originates from the fact that we here use the selfconsistent pairing field generated from the dddi , whose force strength becomes large at low densities .",
    "the pair field extending to far outside the nucleus plays important roles .",
    "we have formulated the deformed continuum hfb method which is designed for weakly bound deformed nuclei .",
    "we utilized here the exact construction of the quasiparticle green s function for deformed hfb mean - fields on the basis of the coupled - channel representation .",
    "the proper boundary condition of the out - going wave is imposed on the continuum quasiparticles .",
    "we have analyzed numerically effects of the continuum coupling and the weak binding on the pair correlation .",
    "it is found that the quasiparticle states in the non - resonant continuum play significant role to generate the pair correlation .",
    "it is also suggested that the effective pairing gap of weakly bound orbits is not reduced very much , provided that the pairing interaction has the surface enhancement .",
    "the work is supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research(no.20540259 ) from the japan society for the promotion of science , and also by the jsps core - to - core program , international research network for exotic femto systems(efes ) ."
