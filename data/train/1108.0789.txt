    "black hole binaries ( bhbs ) have x - ray emission which is variable on a broad range of timescales . on the longest timescales ( @xmath1 weeks ) ,",
    "these sources are seen to transition between quiescence , when they are hardly visible above the x - ray background ; and outburst , when they are amongst the brightest x - ray objects in the sky . during the rise from quiescence to outburst",
    ", the source displays an evolution in spectral state . at the lowest luminosities ,",
    "the source is in the low / hard state , with a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) dominated by a hard ( photon index @xmath2 ) power law tail but also including a weak disc component and reflection features . as the average mass accretion rate , @xmath3 , increases , the disc increases in luminosity , the power law softens ( @xmath4 ) and the reflection fraction increases ( intermediate state ) .",
    "as the luminosity increases further , the sed either becomes almost completely disc dominated ( high / soft or ultrasoft state ) or it displays both a strong disc component with a soft ( @xmath5 ) power law tail ( very high state ; see e.g done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 , hereafter dgk07 ) .",
    "the sed of the low / hard state can be explained by a two component model whereby the standard cool , optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) is truncated at some radius @xmath6 which is greater than the last stable orbit , @xmath7 .",
    "interior to this is a hot , optically thin , geometrically thick accretion flow , perhaps similar to an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "we observe a fraction of the disc emission directly but some of the photons emitted by the disc are incident upon the flow where they are compton up scattered by the hot electrons thus creating the power law tail .",
    "as the source evolves , the truncation radius decreases which increases both the amount of direct disc emission and the number of seed photons incident on the flow thus cooling the comptonizing electrons and softening the power law index of the flow emission .",
    "the spectral evolution throughout the rise to outburst can be described by assuming that @xmath6 decreases as the average mass accretion rate increases until @xmath8 in the high / soft state ( esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 , dgk07 ) .",
    "while this truncated disc model has been challenged by direct observation of the disc inner edge at the last stable orbit in the low / hard state ( miller , homan & miniutti 2006 ; rykoff et al 2007 ) , this interpretation of the data has itself been challenged ( done & diaz trigo 2010 ; gierlinski , done & page 2009 ) .",
    "thus there is no unambiguous evidence as yet which rules out these models , and all alternative geometries ( e.g. markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ; miller , homan & miniutti 2006 ) run into other difficulties ( dgk07 ) .",
    "hence we use the truncated disc model as our overall framework , and explore how this can also be used to interpret the rapid variability seen within a single observation of @xmath9 .",
    "a power spectral analysis of this rapid variability reveals quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) superimposed on a broad band noise of variability .",
    "the broad band noise can be described using broad lorentzians centred at characteristic frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 , often referred to as the low and high frequency breaks .",
    "the qpo ( fundamental and higher harmonics ) can be described by narrow lorentzians centred at @xmath12 , @xmath13 etc ( e.g. belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2002 ) .",
    "as the sed evolves on long timescales , so does the corresponding power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "all the psd frequencies , @xmath10 , @xmath12 and ( to a lesser extent ) @xmath11 increase with luminosity and are correlated ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; klein - wolt & van der klis 2008 ; van der klis 2004 ; psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ; belloni 2010 ) .",
    "however , the amount of power at high frequencies ( @xmath14 ) , remains constant despite the increase in @xmath11 ( gierliski , nikoajuk , & czerny 2008 ) .",
    "although the variability properties have been studied for over 20 years , the underlying physical processes are still poorly understood .",
    "most previous attempts to physically model the variability properties focus on explaining either the qpo or the broadband noise .",
    "we review these briefly below .",
    "there are many proposed qpo mechanisms in the literature , some of which are based on a misalignment between the angular momentum of the black hole and that of the binary system ( e.g. stella & vietri 1998 ; fragile , mathews & wilson 2001 ; schnittman 2005 ; schnittman et al 2006 ; ingram , done & fragile 2009 , hereafter idf09 ) and others are associated with wave modes in the accretion flow ( wagoner et al 2001 ; titarchuk & oscherovich 1999 ; cabanac et al 2010 ) . in idf09 , we outlined a qpo model based on the original relativistic precession model of stella & vietri ( 1998 ) . here , the qpo frequency is given by the lense - thirring precession frequency of a test mass ( say , a hot spot ; e.g. schnittman 2005 ) at the truncation radius .",
    "lense - thirring precession is a relativistic effect which occurs because of the asymmetric gravitational potential present around a spinning black hole .",
    "a test mass orbit will precess around the black hole if it is misaligned with the black hole spin plane as spacetime is being dragged around the black hole .",
    "as the particle reaches the starting point of its orbit ( i.e. @xmath15 ) , that point in spacetime has rotated some way around the black hole .",
    "our extension of this model was to replace the test mass with the entire hot accretion flow interior to the disc truncation radius .",
    "there is a differential warp across the flow due to the radial dependence of lense - thirring precession ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "warps are communicated by bending waves which travel at ( close to ) the sound speed .",
    "for a hot flow the sound speed is fast , so the warp can be communicated across the whole hot inner flow on a timescale which is _ shorter _ than the precession period on the outer edge .",
    "the entire hot flow can then precess as a solid body ( though it is still differentially rotating ) , with a precession frequency given by the surface density weighted average of @xmath17 .",
    "this global precession is confirmed by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations of a tilted flow ( fragile et al 2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "a cool , thin disc responds very differently as here the sound speed across the disc is much longer than the precession period .",
    "viscous diffusion then results in a steady state warp of the disc into the plane of the black hole spin at small radii ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ; kumar & pringle 1985 , fragile , mathews & wilson 2001 ) , rather than global precession about the black hole spin axis .    in idf09",
    ", we showed how global precession of the entire hot inner flow interior to a stationary truncated disc can give the qpo .",
    "the increasing frequency can be produced by the outer radius of the hot flow ( set by the inner radius of the truncated disc ) moving inwards from @xmath18 , as also implied by the sed evolution .",
    "this model is also attractive as it ties the qpo to the hot flow , so trivially modulates the comptonised spectrum rather than the disc component , as required by the data ( rodriguez et al 2004 ; sobolewska & zycki 2005 ) .",
    "the underlying viscosity mechanism in the flow is most likely the magneto rotational instability ( mri ; hawley & balbus 1991 ) .",
    "it is looking increasingly likely that this is also the underlying source of broad band variability in the flow as it generates large fluctuations in all quantities ( e.g. krolik & hawley 2002 ; dexter & fragile 2011 ; beckwith , hawley & krolik 2008 ) .",
    "the temporal variability generated by the mri extends to very high frequencies but the emission is inherently linked to the reservoir of available gravitational energy and therefore should depend on the mass accretion rate , @xmath19 .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the variability in @xmath19 at a given radius is characterised by the local viscous frequency , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 in the simplest case .",
    "this interpretation implies that @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inner radius of the flow ( e.g. ingram & done 2010 ) .",
    "although this is a rather crude approximation , it has the very attractive property that the low frequency noise is tied to the truncation radius but the high frequency noise is not .",
    "this can explain the observed correlation of the low frequency break in the psd with the low frequency qpo , as both are set by @xmath6 , while the high frequency break is more or less constant as @xmath24 does not change(gierliski , nikoajuk , & czerny 2008 ) .",
    "another fundamental property of the data which must be reproduced by any variability model is the sigma - flux relation ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ) .",
    "this can be measured by splitting the light curve into multiple short segments and finding the average and standard deviation of each segment .",
    "after binning , the standard deviation is always seen to be linearly related to the average flux .",
    "this shows that the variability is correlated across all timescales and therefore , in a picture where different temporal frequencies come predominantly from different spatial regions , there must be a causal connection between those regions .",
    "this rules out simple shot noise models , where the variability is independent . instead",
    ", the sigma - flux relation _ can _ be reproduced if the fluctuations in @xmath19 generated at a given radius _",
    "propagate _ inwards towards the black hole as might be intuitively expected in an accretion flow ( lyubarskii 1997 ; kotov et al 2001 ; arevalo & uttley 2006 hereafter au06 )      in ingram & done 2011 ( hereafter id11 ) , we explored combining these ideas of both qpo and noise by developing a model with propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in a precessing flow .",
    "the mass accretion rate fluctuations produce the observed band limited noise and the precession frequency modulates the fluctuating light curve to create the qpo .",
    "crucially , these two processes are linked .",
    "we use the same geometry ( inner and outer radius of the hot flow , surface density of the hot flow ) to make both the qpo _ and _ broadband noise properties .",
    "precession of the fluctuating flow modulates its observed emission , imprinting the qpo on the broadband noise , while fluctuations in the flow cause fluctuations in the precession frequency , making a quasi - periodic rather than periodic oscillation .    here",
    "we develop a more advanced version of the model which is in better agreement with the results of grmhd simulations , together with better statistical techniques to fit these models to the psd data .",
    "we have made this package publically available within xspec ( arnaud et al 1996 ) as a local model , propfluc .",
    "as in id11 , the model consists of fluctuations in mass accretion rate which propagate towards the black hole ( following lyubarskii 1997 , kotov et al 2001 and au06 ) within a flow that is precessing .",
    "here we develop the model to include a number of improvements which allow us to gain more physical insight from the best fit parameters .",
    "most significantly , we change our underlying assumption about the viscous frequency @xmath20 . in id11",
    "we assumed that this was a power law between @xmath24 and @xmath6 , the inner and outer radius of the precessing hot flow .",
    "here we have it be a smoothly broken power law , with the radius of the break being the bending wave radius , @xmath25 , expected from a misaligned flow .",
    "the viscous frequency is related to the surface density profile , @xmath26 via the radial infall velocity @xmath27 as @xmath28 and mass conservation sets @xmath29 .",
    "hence we can use the surface density profiles from the grmhd simulations to derive @xmath20 , which is especially important as the qpo frequency is dependent on @xmath30 .",
    "we also change the assumed emissivity from id11 , where @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 was an unknown boundary condition ) to @xmath33 i.e. we tie the emission to where the mass is in the flow .",
    "we describe the details of the model below , mainly focusing on these improvements made since id11 .",
    "note that , throughout the paper , we use the convention @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a gravitational radius and we always assume a 10 solar mass black hole .",
    "the surface density of the flow sets the qpo frequency by global precession as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the keplerian orbital frequency and @xmath38 is the point particle lense - thirring precession frequency ( given by equation 2 in id11 ) .",
    "we use the grmhd simulations of tilted flows to guide our description of @xmath30 ( fragile et al 2007 ; 2009 ; fragile 2009 ) . these can be well fit by a smoothly broken power law function @xmath39 ( idf09 ) , where @xmath40 is radius normalised to the bending wave radius @xmath41 , @xmath42 is a dimensionless normalisation constant and @xmath3 is the average mass accretion rate which we will assume stays constant over the course of a single observation .",
    "this gives @xmath43 for small @xmath44 and @xmath45 for large @xmath44 , where @xmath46 governs the sharpness of the break .",
    "the bending wave radius occurs at radii larger than the last stable orbit because there are additional torques created by the misaligned black hole spin which result in additional stresses i.e. enhanced angular momentum transport .",
    "the material in falls faster , so its surface density drops .",
    "mass conservation then sets the viscous frequency as @xmath47 such that @xmath48 for large @xmath44 and @xmath49 for small @xmath44 .      as in id11 ( and au06 ) , we start by splitting the flow up into @xmath50 annuli of width @xmath51 such that @xmath52 ( the truncation radius ) and @xmath53 ( the inner radius of the flow ) .",
    "we assume that the power spectrum of variability generated in mass accretion rate at the @xmath54 annulus is given by a zero centred lorentzian cutting off at the local viscous frequency @xmath55 where a tilde denotes a fourier transform and @xmath56 is derived from equation [ eqn : fvisc ] .",
    "we use the method of timmer & koenig ( 1995 ) to generate mass accretion rate fluctuations , @xmath57 , which satisfy equation [ eqn : poff ] .",
    "these are normalised to have a mean of unity and fractional variability @xmath58 where , unlike id11 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the fractional variability and number of annuli per decade in _ viscous frequency _ rather than radius .",
    "these two descriptions are exactly equivalent where @xmath61 is a power law function of radius as in id11 , as @xmath62",
    ". however , the more physical smoothly broken power law form for @xmath61 does not retain this property .",
    "we choose to parametrise the noise power in terms of @xmath63 ( see below ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate through the outer annulus is given by @xmath64 .",
    "variability is generated in every other annulus according to equation [ eqn : poff ] , but this is also accompanied by the noise from the outer regions of the flow which propagates inwards .",
    "thus the mass accretion rate at the @xmath54 annulus is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the propagation time across the @xmath54 annulus and @xmath67 is the infall velocity .",
    "to convert these mass accretion rate fluctuations into a lightcurve , we assume that the luminosity emitted from the @xmath54 annulus is given by @xmath68 where the ( dimensionless ) emissivity is given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the emissivity index , @xmath71 the accretion efficiency , @xmath32 the boundary condition and @xmath72 is a normalisation constant . in id11 , we considered two boundary conditions : the ` stress free ' boundary condition @xmath73 and the ` stressed ' boundary condition @xmath74 . here , however , we make the intuitive and physical assumption that the boundary condition is set by the surface density such that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the _ time averaged _ surface density .",
    "this allows the model to link the emission with the amount of material in a particular annulus .",
    "the fluctuating mass accretion rate will also have an effect on precession because mass conservation needs to hold on short time scales as well as long time scales , which gives @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the surface density at time @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 which trivially averages to equation [ eqn : sigmabar ] on long time scales .",
    "because the surface density sets the precession frequency ( equation [ eqn : fprec ] ) , we see that the fluctuations in mass accretion rate cause the precession frequency to vary , thus allowing the model to predict a quasi - periodic oscillation rather than a purely periodic oscillation .    @xmath80      in id11 , we parametrised the viscous frequency with a power law .",
    "the fiducial model parameters therein gave @xmath81 , corresponding to a surface density profile @xmath82 between the inner and outer radii which were set to @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "by comparison , the grmhd titled flow simulations of fragile et al ( 2009 ) also give @xmath82 at large radii , but then smoothly break at the bending wave radius to a much steeper dependence . the most relevent simulation to this paper is the case with @xmath85 as this is likely closest to the spin of xte j1550 - 564 ( e.g. davis , done & blaes 2006 ; steiner et al 2011 ) . this has surface density parameters ( equation [ eqn : sigmabar ] , see figure 4 in idf09 ) of @xmath86 ( corresponding to @xmath87 ) , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sigmap ] a and b , we plot these two different surface density prescriptions and their resulting viscous frequencies , with the power law shown by the black solid line and the broken power law shown by the red dashed line . in the case of the broken power law",
    ", we choose the normalisation @xmath91 to ensure that both assumptions become consistent with one another at large radii .",
    "figure [ fig : sigmap ] c shows the psd resulting from the two different prescriptions .",
    "the new ( and more physically realistic ) surface density prescription predicts much less noise at high frequencies than the previous model , where the surface density remained constant down to the innermost radii .",
    "this distinction is even more striking as our assumption that the mri noise power is constant per decade in frequency ( as opposed to radius ) means that the regions with @xmath92 have more mri power generated per decade ( in radial extent ) than those with @xmath93 . yet",
    "even this additional power at small radii is not sufficient to give enough high frequency power to match that seen in the data .    to retrieve sufficient high frequency power requires @xmath94 rather than @xmath95 ( green dot - dashed lines in fig [ fig : sigmap ] a and b ) .",
    "this gives a more gradual drop - off in surface density , leading to a less severe transition in viscous frequency at the bending wave radius and hence more high frequency power ( green points in fig [ fig : sigmap]c ) .",
    "we discuss the physical implications of this in more detail in section [ sec : disc ] . for now , however , we use @xmath94 for our fiducial model .",
    "@xmath96    = 6.5 cm      following the discussion in section [ sec : sigma ] , we use model parameters @xmath91 , @xmath86 , @xmath88 , @xmath94 and @xmath90 . we also set @xmath97 and @xmath98 but note that the new assumptions for surface density coupled with the new boundary condition mean the model is now much less sensitive to the parameter @xmath24 than its predecessor in id11 . figure [ fig : lc]a shows a @xmath99 segment of the light curve created using these assumptions and with @xmath84 .",
    "we use @xmath100 ( i.e. @xmath101 annuli per decade in viscous frequency ) with @xmath102 time steps , giving a duration of @xmath103 ( similar to a typical rxte observation ) for a time bin of @xmath104 .",
    "figure [ fig : lc]b confirms that this light curve has the linear sigma - flux relation implied by its skewed nature .",
    "the psd of this light curve is represented by the red points in figure [ fig : sigmap]c .",
    "we calculate the qpo as in id11 , but we briefly summarise this here for completeness .",
    "the qpo fundamental frequency is set to the average ( over the @xmath103 duration ) precession frequency calculated from equation [ eqn : fprec ] . in principle we can calculate the width of the qpo from the fluctuations in frequency which result from fluctuations in surface density .",
    "however , these only set a lower limit to the width of the qpo since it can also be broadened by other processes ( id11 ) , so we leave this as a free parameter .",
    "we can in principle predict the harmonic structure in the qpo lightcurve by a full comptonisation calculation of the angle dependent emission from a precessing hot flow ( ingram , done & zycki in preparation ) . until then",
    ", we simply allow the normalisations of the harmonics to be a free parameter but fix their width so that they have the same quality factor as the fundamental ( apart from the sub - harmonic which is free : rao et al 2010 ) .",
    "we use the method of timmer & koenig ( 1995 ) to generate a light curve from these narrow qpo lorentzians and add this to the light curve already created for the broad band noise .",
    "figure [ fig:3power ] shows the full psd given by the fiducial model parameters with @xmath84 ( black ) , @xmath105 ( red ) and @xmath106 ( green ) . for clarity we set the normalisations of the qpo harmonics to zero , and",
    "increase the normalisation and quality factor of the fundamental as @xmath6 decreases to match with the data .",
    "this captures the essence of the observed evolution of the psd in terms of a decreasing truncation radius .",
    "@xmath107    the main problem with power spectral fitting is that we can only calculate the power spectrum of an infinitely long light curve which , of course can neither be observed nor simulated ! the discreet version of the power spectrum is the periodogram which provides an estimate of the power spectrum , but a very poor one with large , non - gaussian errors .",
    "there are two main techniques for smoothing the periodogram in order to improve the statistics ( i.e. smaller and more gaussian errors ) .",
    "firstly , the lightcurve can be split up into shorter segments with the psd estimate given by averaging the periodogram over all segments .",
    "secondly ( or additionally ) the linearly sampled psd can be averaged into logarithmic / geometrically spaced frequency intervals ( e.g. van der klis 1989 ) .    in id11 , we averaged the logarithm of the periodogram in order to get a psd estimate which , for agn or any red noise power spectra , gives an unbiased estimate with errors close to gaussian for a small amount of smoothing compared with averaging the periodogram linearly ( papadakis & lawrence 1993 ) .",
    "however , the bhb power spectra are better described by band limited noise , with high @xmath108 . in this case , averaging the logarithmic periodogram gives a biased estimator ( because the bias is proportional to @xmath108 ; papadakis & lawrence 1993 ) . because of this , we experienced some statistical difficulties , the most obvious being apparent over - fitting with reduced @xmath109 falling well below unity ( indicating a good fit ) for parameters which have a high rejection probability . here",
    "instead we average the periodograms linearly and test to see how reliable @xmath109 is as a measure of goodness of fit in this case .",
    "this also has the added advantage that we can compare to the white noise subtracted psd from the data , whereas , because logarithmic power must be positive definite , we previously had to add white noise to the model .",
    "we split each simulated model lightcurve of @xmath110s into @xmath111 segments each of duration @xmath112s , so the lowest frequency we can resolve is @xmath113hz .",
    "we average these at each linearly spaced frequency bin , @xmath114 to get @xmath115 and the dispersion around this mean @xmath116 .",
    "we then re - bin the result in the same way as the data in geometrically separated frequency bins , @xmath117 , so that the model power is @xmath118 and its propagated error is @xmath119 where the sums are taken over all the @xmath120 which fall inside the bin width of @xmath117 .",
    "the lowest geometric frequency bin typically only contains one linear frequency bin , so is an average over only 32 points .",
    "while this would not be gaussianly distributed for red noise ( papadakis & lawrence 1993 ) our noise power spectra at these low frequencies are typically white , so this is approximately gaussian . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the psd is made from averaging many more estimates , so is again approximately gaussian .",
    "thus we should get a good estimate for the best fit by minimising @xmath109 between the model and data using @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the psd of the data , and @xmath123 is the propagated error from the ( linear ) averaging of the multiple segments and geometric re binning . for the data ,",
    "the number of segments dependends on the observation length rather than being fixed as in the model . for our lightcurves",
    "this gives @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath127 segments for observations @xmath128 respectively .",
    "the rather small number of segments in observations 3 - 5 mean that the errors on the data at the lowest frequencies may only be approximately gaussian , but the total error is given by the sum of those from _",
    "both _ the model and the data , so the fit statistic should remain close to a @xmath109 distribution , so minimising @xmath109 should indeed return the best fit .",
    "we have coded the entire model into xspec for public release as propfluc , described in detail in the appendix .",
    "we use the same data as in id11 so that we can directly compare results i.e. rxte data from the 1998 rise to outburst of xte j1550 - 564 ( sobczak et al 2000 ; wilson & done 2001 ; remillard et al 2002 ; rao et al 2010 ; altamirano 2008 ) from obs ids : 30188 - 06 - 03 - 00 , 30188 - 06 - 01 - 00 , 30188 - 06 - 01 - 03 , 30188 - 06 - 05 - 00 and 30188 - 06 - 11 - 00 ( hereafter observations 1 - 5 respectively ) .",
    "we consider energy channels 36 - 71 ( i.e. 10 - 20kev ) in order to avoid any direct contamination from the disc emission .",
    "we fit each observed psd to derive the parameters of the smoothly broken power law surface density .",
    "we assume that the shape of the surface density stays constant across all datasets , but its normalisation @xmath42 can change .",
    "we also allow the bending wave radius to be a free parameter , @xmath41 ( where @xmath129 is the scaleheight of the flow ) .",
    "as we have fixed the spin , the best fit value of @xmath25 gives us an estimate of the scale height of the flow which may change through the transition due to the increase in seed photons from the disc cooling the flow .",
    "the inner radius of the flow is tied across all the data sets , and we fit for @xmath6 .",
    "the remaining free parameters which determine the broadband noise are the level of mri fluctuations generated over each decade in frequency , @xmath59 , and the emissivity index , @xmath70 ( held constant across all 5 observations ) .",
    "while xspec can fit the model to the 5 psd simultaneously , this is very slow .",
