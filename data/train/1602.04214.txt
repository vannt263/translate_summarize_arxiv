    "the interaction between impacting systems is nowadays extensively investigated . in many systems such as tooling machines , gear boxes , heat exchangers and backlash gear the motion of some elements",
    "is limited by a barrier .",
    "there are many impact models which give the relations between the interacting system elements .",
    "generally , they can be divided into two groups , i.e. , the hard and soft impacts @xcite .",
    "the hard impacts are modeled by the restitution coefficient @xcite . in this approach",
    "the time of contact is infinitely small and the exchange of energy is instantaneous . the second approach ( soft impact )",
    "assumes the finite , nonzero contact time and a penetration of the base by the colliding body .",
    "hence , the contact is modeled as a linear @xcite , hertzian @xcite or other nonlinear @xcite spring and viscous damper .",
    "the separate equations of motion describe the in - contact and out - of - contact dynamics .",
    "the numerous works have been devoted to phenomena induced by the the impacts .",
    "the bifurcation scenarios and implication of grazing events are quite well understood @xcite .",
    "there are a few studies which focus on the systems where impacts between coupled oscillators are transient .",
    "blazejczyk - okolewska _ et .",
    "@xcite show that impacting systems can synchronize ( via the exchange of energy during the contact ) in anti - phase on chaotic attractor .",
    "the impacts can be considered as a discontinuous transient coupling which disappears once the interacting systems reach the synchronous solutions .",
    "the phenomenon of synchronization is commonly encountered in non - linear systems @xcite .",
    "generally , in coupled mechanical systems one can observe two types of synchronous motion , i.e. , the complete and the phase synchronization @xcite . as the coupling between mechanical oscillators ( two directly interacting bodies or via spring , damper or inerter ) is always bidirectional ; when systems are completely synchronized the value of coupling force is equal to zero , and only if common motion is perturbed the systems once again start to interact ( note that for non - mechanical systems it is not always true ) .",
    "this is the straightforward analogy to the above mentioned discontinuous transient coupling via impacts , where the perturbation of stable non - impacting solution leads to the appearance of transient impacting motion ( coupling ) .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the idea and present solution to reduce complexity via transient impacts .",
    "we consider systems of two identical oscillators and assume that interaction between them occurs through soft impacts .",
    "when the systems are uncoupled we observe multiple stable attractors for each subsystem .",
    "using a piecewise transient coupling to another identical subsystem we can change the number of stable attractors and , in many cases , specify on which attractor both systems settle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider a simple model which is used to demonstrate the main idea of our approach and define the notations introduced to describe existing periodic states . in the next section we present and describe",
    "the how via discontinuous coupling we can decrease number of solutions in the complex systems with many co - existing periodic solutions of different type .",
    "the possible coexistence of impacting and non - impacting solutions is discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 the conclusions are given .",
    "in this section we show the main idea of our approach using a simple example .",
    "first , the considered model is introduced and the notations used to classify the existing solutions are defined .",

    "the system considered in this subsection consists of two identical duffing oscillators shown in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "oscillators in their steady states ( at rest ) are separated by the distance @xmath0 , and the impacts which could occur between them are of the soft type due to the presence of a spring with stiffness @xmath1 and a viscous damper with damping coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "two duffing oscillators have masses @xmath3 each and are damped by viscous dampers with damping coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "the spring connecting each oscillator to the wall is nonlinear and of hardening type , where both stiffness coefficients are positive : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "both duffing systems are driven by harmonic forces with the amplitude @xmath7 and the frequency @xmath8 but there is a phase shift between these forces .",
    "forcing of the first oscillator has fixed phase ( equal to zero ) while for the second one there is a phase shift @xmath9 which is used as a control parameter ( @xmath10 ) .    ]",
    "the whole system is described by the following equations of motion :    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 describes the forces generated by the discontinuous coupling and is given by the formula : @xmath14 the values of the parameters are as follows : @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 $ ] , @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 $ ] .",

    "we introduce the notations that enable to describe all periodic states of two impacting oscillators , hence we can classify all solutions that can occur in the considered system . to recall ,",
    "we assume that the left ( first ) system is a reference system , hence its phase of excitation and position are fixed while for the right ( second ) system the phase of excitation @xmath9 can vary in the range form @xmath44 to @xmath45 and the oscillator s position can be changed to decrease or increase the distance @xmath0 .",
    "the solution of the left oscillator is described in the following way : @xmath46 where : @xmath47 is the number of the attractor ( in case of multiple attractors of isolated oscillator ) and @xmath48 is the period of given attractor in respect to the period of excitation ( we assume that solutions are periodic ) .",
    "similarly , the solution of the right oscillator is given by : @xmath49 where : @xmath50 is the number of the attractor ( in case of multiple attractors of isolated oscillator ) , @xmath51 is the period of given attractor . to define the solution of the interacting oscillators system",
    "we will use the following notations : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the shift in phase between the systems given by an integer number when the period of solution is longer than the period of excitation i.e , @xmath54 for @xmath45 shift and so on .",
    "the best example to describe the importance of @xmath53 is a case when we have two identical systems both with the same period-2 solution ( i.e. their response periods are twice longer than the period of excitation ) . in poincar map , for both systems , we observe two dots .",
    "let s assume that the position of the first oscillator , at the sampling moment of time , is in one of the dots .",

    "number of possible shifts is equal to the greatest common divisor ( @xmath56 ) of both systems solutions periods .",
    "let us now consider an example where both oscillators have period-2 and period-5 co - existing solutions .",
    "if the first oscillator is on period-2 solution and the second one is on period-5 solution only one configuration is possible because @xmath57 , so we have one possible value of @xmath55 . in the other case where both oscillators have period-4 and period-6 co - existing solutions , the @xmath58 , hence @xmath55 or @xmath54 .",

    "it is easy to see that along one period of the whole system all possible pairs of numbers are created , hence no more states can occur and any shift makes no difference . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure1 - 2 - 2](b ) we show the second example when two possible configurations for systems with periods 4 and 6 .",

    "we see that shifts @xmath55 and @xmath54 create all possible pairs of dots on poincare map .    for example , if each oscillator has only one period-2 solution , the solutions of the interacting system can be described as @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "more examples and the detailed explanations for the possible solutions in the system with co - existing attractors are given in the following sections .",
