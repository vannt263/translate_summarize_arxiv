    "examples of white dwarfs in binary systems with early - mid m dwarf companions are plentiful .",
    "many are resolved as common proper motion pairs ( e.g. silvestri et al .",
    "2001 ) , while a number of unresolved systems have recently been identified through near - infrared photometry ( e.g green , ali & napiwotzki 2000 ) .",
    "a further proportion are revealed in optical spectra either as excess red emission or through the detection of narrow emission components in the cores of the white dwarf s hi balmer absorption lines ( e.g. thorstensen , vennes & shambrook 1994 ) .",
    "this emission may either be intrinsic to an active cool companion ( e.g. re  j1629@xmath4780 , cooke et al .",
    "1992 , sion et al .",
    "1995 ) , or be due to the irradiation of the atmosphere of the cool star facing the hot white dwarf , particularly if the system components are close ( e.g. vennes & thorstensen 1994 ) .",
    "the latter systems are of interest as one outcome of common envelope ( ce ) evolution and/or as the precursors of cataclysmic variable systems ( pre - cvs ) . some may even be old cvs during a period of no mass transfer ( howell & ciardi 2001 ) .",
    "as relatively few of these close systems are known , when discovered they are intensively studied spectroscopically to obtain mass functions from the radial velocity curves ( e.g. vennes , thorstensen & polomski 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , very few white dwarfs with late - m and cooler companions of very - low stellar or substellar mass are known ( e.g farihi et al .",
    "this is likely due , in part , to the spectral energy distribution of such systems being dominated at optical wavelengths by the white dwarf , particularly if the degenerate star is relatively hot ( t@xmath5k ) . in these systems",
    "the companion instead may be revealed photometrically as an infrared excess e.g. the white dwarf @xmath4 l4 dwarf pair gd165 ( becklin & zuckerman 1988 , kirkpatrick et al . 1999 ) or through the detection of features characteristic of a cool dwarf in a near - ir spectrum .",
    "indeed , farihi & christopher ( 2004 ) have recently announced the detection from 2mass photometry and k band ir spectroscopy of an unresolved companion with spectral type l5.5 or later to the zz ceti white dwarf gd1400 .",
    "this likely represents the first unambiguous detection of a substellar companion to a white dwarf .",
    "however , despite makarov ( 2004 ) having recently claimed the existence of a substellar companion with a mass @xmath6m@xmath7 to the nearest isolated white dwarf , van maanen 2 , on the basis of hipparcos astrometric measurements , a subsequent attempt to directly detect this brown dwarf , in adaptive optics images obtained in the l band and archival mid - infrared iso observations , has been unsuccessful .",
    "therefore , his interpretation is now virtually ruled out ( farihi , becklin & macintosh 2004 ) .",
    "further , although wachter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have recently identified 47 new unresolved white dwarf @xmath4 red dwarf binaries from 2mass photometry , they are unable to claim any as bona fide very - low - mass stars or brown dwarfs .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^,^ , > , > \" , ]      green , ali & napiwotzki ( 2000 ) searched j and k band photometry of 47 extreme - ultraviolet selected degenerates , drawn from the catalogues of the euve all - sky and rosat wide field camera surveys , for a @xmath9 excess in both bands with respect to the predictions of white dwarf models .",
    "this led to the identification of 10 marginally resolved or unresolved white dwarf + dm systems , half of which were not previously suspected of being composite in nature .",
    "a more recent analysis of several hundred white dwarfs drawn from the mccook & sion ( 1999 ) catalogue and present in the 2mass second incremental point source catalogue , has revealed , on the basis of their location in the j - h , h - k colour - colour diagram , 95 candidate white dwarf + red dwarf binaries , 47 of which were previously unknown ( wachter et al .",
    "we note that gd50 and re j0457 - 280 were included in both these photometric surveys and gd659 in the wachter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) study but none of the three were flagged as a likely unresolved white dwarf + red dwarf composite .",
    "nevertheless , the present spectroscopic investigation allows us to probe to cooler spectral types and hence slightly lower masses .",
    "for example , by demanding a @xmath9 flux excess at j in addition to k , green , ali & napiwotzki ( 2000 ) effectively limit their search to companions with types earlier than late - m .",
    "furthermore , using synthetic 2mass colours generated from a number of white dwarf and composite white dwarf + red dwarf models we have examined the location in the j - h , h - k colour - colour diagram of various combinations and find that for white dwarfs with effective temperatures and surface gravities comparable to gd659 and gd71 , two of the cooler objects in our collection , the wachter et al . method would fail to unearth companions later than @xmath10m9 .",
    "the limit is even earlier for the hottest white dwarfs studied here ( with similar or larger radii ) .",
    "however , a detailed examination of figures 1a - d , top and bottom , reveals no convincing evidence for the presence of a spatially unresolved cool companion to any of the eight targets of the present study .",
    "therefore , following the method outlined in the previous section , we have placed the approximate limits given in table  [ tab2 ] on the spectral type of a putative companion to each white dwarf .",
    "subsequently , we have used these limits to constrain the mass of each putative companion .      although the cooling age of each white dwarf can be estimated from theoretical evolutionary models ( e.g wood 1995 ) , we do nt know with any certainty the mass and hence lifetime of their progenitors . therefore , we are unwilling to assign an age to the putative associate of any of our white dwarfs ( ie .",
    "progenitor lifetime + wd cooling time ) .",
    "as the effective temperatures of very - low - mass stars and substellar objects remain a function of both mass and age at times of the order gigayears , when using our spectral - type limits to constrain masses , we instead assume a range of ages broadly encompassing likely values .",
    "we have used the polynomial fit detailed in table 4 of golimowski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to assign approximate effective temperatures to the spectral type limits shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "subsequently , we refer to the low mass stellar / substellar evolutionary models for solar metallicity of baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , using cubic splines to interpolate between their points , to estimate corresponding masses at ages 1gyr , 5gyrs and 10gyrs as shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "clearly , even for an age comparable to that of the galactic disk our results argue strongly against the presence of a companion with m@xmath11m@xmath1 to any of the degenerates in our collection .",
    "indeed , population synthesis models indicate that most of these white dwarfs are likely to be the progeny of local disk f stars ( e.g. aznor cuadrado et al .",
    "2004 , schroder , pauli & napiwotzki 2004 ) . as the lifetime of a f",
    "star is @xmath12gyrs ( e.g de loore & doom 1992 ) , and the time it takes a da white dwarf of canonical mass ( 0.6m@xmath1 ) to cool to 12000k is @xmath13gyrs years , the majority of these objects likely formed less than 6gyrs ago .",
    "considering the typical distances of the white dwarfs in this study ( @xmath14pc ) , the atmospheric conditions at the time the data were acquired and the width of the instrument slit , the spectroscopic nature of our observations renders our study most sensitive to companions at a  @xmath1560au from our degenerate primaries .",
    "it is probable that the manner in which we have selected our targets , as described in section 1 , has biased our work against systems containing cool dwarfs earlier than mid - m spectral type .",
    "the presence of such stars would most likely have been detected as excess red continuum in the optical spectrum ( e.g. vennes & thorstensen 1994 ) of these relatively well studied white dwarfs .",
    "hence this work is , in effect , sensitive to secondaries of mid - m type and later , which in terms of mass is m@xmath16m@xmath1 ( kirkpatrick , henry & mccarthy 1991 ; baraffe et al .",
    "the spectral types of the 10 cool companions unearthed from the euv selected sample of white dwarfs were estimated to range from @xmath10m3.5-m6.5 ( m@xmath17m@xmath1 ; green , ali & napiwotzki 2000 ; kirkpatrick , henry & mccarthy 1991 ) . neglecting that poorer seeing and",
    "a slightly more distant white dwarf sample probably resulted in their photometric study having some additional sensitivity to companions at wider separations , if we assume a mass function for the secondary stars of dn / dm@xmath18m@xmath19 ( e.g. reid & gizis 1997 ) , on the basis of the green , ali & napiwotzki result , we can estimate , albeit rather crudely , that we might have expected to detect late - type companions to @xmath10 1 in 6 of the white dwarfs in the present collection .",
    "although the small number of white dwarfs in our study has likely contributed significantly to our failure to detect a late - type secondary , it has become apparent from the results of detailed radial velocity surveys that there is a deficiency of very - low - mass stellar and substellar companions to f , g and k type main sequence stars at separations less than @xmath12au ( q(m@xmath20/m@xmath21 ; e.g halbwachs et al .",
    "2003 , marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "recent coronographic near - ir imaging of more than 250 nearby , young ( @xmath22myrs ) g , k and m dwarf main sequence stars indicates that this `` brown dwarf desert '' , as it has become known , extends out to @xmath23au ( mccarthy & zuckerman 2004 ) .",
    "while it could be argued that very - low - mass stellar and substellar companions lying within a few au of a white dwarf s progenitor would be obliterated during a common envelope phase of post main - sequence evolution , binary evolution models indicate that unless the transfer of energy from the companions orbit to the stellar envelope is extremely inefficient , a significant proportion of very - low - mass secondaries will survive this phase ( politano 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , our study is sensitive to companions lying well beyond the typical radius of the envelope of an agb star ( @xmath24au , schenker , 2004 , private comm . ) , even allowing for the change in separation which likely occurs as mass is lost from the white dwarf progenitor .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that our search overlaps with the top end of the the brown dwarf desert in terms of mass and that this may also have had a bearing on the outcome of our search .",
    "we note that farihi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who are conducting a proper motion survey of white dwarfs based on ir imaging , find very few late - m type and cooler companions , albeit at relatively wide separation ( hundreds of au ) . despite our rather small and disparate collection of targets",
    ", it seems fair to say that the present results do nt contradict previous findings regarding very - low - mass companions to main sequence stars and white dwarfs ie .",
    "we have not unearthed a previously unrecognised population of late - m and l type companions to these da white dwarfs .",
    "these results also have implications for our objects at an individual level , since several are known to exhibit anomolies in their photospheric abundance patterns ( e.g. gd659 ) or hydrogen line profiles ( e.g. wd2359 - 438 ) :    * gd659 : * this white dwarf displays an euv energy distribution consistent with a near pure - h photosphere ( e.g barstow et al .",
    "1997 ) , despite the presence in the atmosphere of c , n and si as revealed by stis and iue spectroscopy ( e.g. barstow et al .",
    "however , detailed inspection of the nv line profiles suggests that this element is not homogeneosly distributed in depth , with the bulk confined to higher , lower pressure layers of the photosphere ( barstow et al .",
    "according to these authors this high degree of stratification is not predicted by radiative levitation theory . using our near - ir spectroscopy we are able to rule out that these abundance anomalies arise from ongoing accretion of material from an unseen companion of spectral type l6 or earlier . refering to the 10gyr model of baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we find that this amounts to the exclusion of a ( spatially unresolved ) stellar companion to gd659 .",
    "* gd50 : * the euve spectrum of this white dwarf reveals the presence of photospheric helium at an abundance of log(he / h)@xmath25 .",
    "this can not be explained in terms of radiative levitation theory , which predicts log(he / h)@xmath26 for an object of gd50 s effective temperature and surface gravity ( vennes et al . 1996 ) .",
    "an alternative source for this helium is material being accreted into the atmosphere from an unseen low mass companion .",
    "however , vennes et al . set a limit of m7-m8 on the spectral type of any such object on the basis of i band photometry . using our near - ir spectroscopy we are now able to push this limit to spectral type t5 , which corresponds to a mass of @xmath27m@xmath28 at an age of 10gyrs .",
    "thus it seems increasingly likely that presence of helium in gd50 is in some way related to its unusually large mass ( m@xmath29m@xmath1 ; marsh et al .",
    "1997 ) , and its possible formation via a stellar merger ( e.g. guerrero , garcia - berro & isern 2004 ) .    *",
    "re j0457 - 280 : * the iue spectrum of this white dwarf reveals the presence of c , n and o in the photosphere .",
    "however , the steep drop in the euv flux shortward of 250  indicate that fe ( and perhaps ni too ) is also likely present in significant quantities",
    ". surprisingly , barstow et al . ( 2003b ) find a much larger discrepancy between the lyman and balmer derived effective temperature determinations , compared to that observed for other das of similar effective temperature and surface gravity . despite the 2mass h - k@xmath30 colour hinting at the presence of a cool companion this",
    "is not confirmed by our near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "instead we rule out an unresolved associate of spectral type l3 or earlier , corresponding to m@xmath31m@xmath1 at 10gyrs ( baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "* gd71 : * the euv energy distribution of gd71 is consistent with a near pure - h atmosphere ( e.g barstow et al .",
    "the co - added iue echelle spectrum provides no convincing evidence from the presence of photospheric metals ( holberg , barstow & sion 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , the radial velocity of this white dwarf shows no significant variability ( maxted , marsh & moran 2000 ) .",
    "thus we have no compelling reason to suspect the existence of a very - low - mass companion . however , on the basis of our near - ir spectroscopy we are now able to exclude a ( spatially unresolved ) stellar companion to gd71 .    * re j2214 - 490 : * enhancements in the c , o , fe and ni abundances in this star with respect to g191-b2b ( barstow et al .",
    "2003a ) , once again raise the possibility of ongoing accretion from an unseen companion .",
    "however , from the near - ir spectroscopy we can rule out an unresolved companion of spectral type m9 or earlier , corresponding to m@xmath11m@xmath1 at 10gyrs ( baraffe et al . 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , increased equilibrium abundances of these elements may simply result from the stars slightly larger effective temperature and marginally lower surface gravity in comparison with g191-b2b ( e.g schuh et al . 2002 ) .",
    "* wd2359@xmath32434 : * this white dwarf is relatively cool ( @xmath33k ) and has a high mass ( @xmath34 ; aznar cuadrado et al .",
    "koester et al .  ( 1998 ) reported a very shallow and narrow h@xmath35 profile and speculated that a magnetic field might be responsible .",
    "aznar cuadrado et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indeed detected a weak magnetic field of 3.1 kg during their spectropolarimetric survey of bright white dwarfs .",
    "however , in order to explain the observed profile of the h@xmath35 core , one has to invoke a magnetic field with a maximum field strength of @xmath3650 kg .",
    "although it can not be completely ruled out that both observations can be explained by a peculiar and complex magnetic field structure , other explanations have to be explored as well .    due to the low temperature and the small radius of wd2359@xmath32434 we can set quite stringent upper limits on a cool companion .",
    "we derived a limiting spectral type of t8 corresponding to 0.05@xmath37 for an age of 10gyr , i.e.  a stellar companion can be ruled out .",
    "warm circumstellar dust causing an infrared excess was detected in the zzceti star g29 - 38 ( tokunaga , becklin & zuckerman 1990 ) .",
    "no sign of such an infrared excess is present in our spectrum of wd2359@xmath32434 , which limits the amount of circumstellar dust which could be present close to the white dwarf .",
    "our detailed near - ir spectroscopic study of a collection of eight predominantly southern hemisphere da white dwarfs has failed to reveal the presence of any late - type companions .",
    "instead , we have placed approximate limits on the spectral - types of putative companions .",
    "these constraints allow us to rule out spatially unresolved low - mass stellar associates to gd659,gd50,gd71 and wd2359 - 434 and companions with m@xmath11m@xmath1 to any of the remaining stars in the collection .",
    "these results argue against ongoing accretion of material from low mass companions as the source of the abundance anomalies seen in a number of these stars .",
    "furthermore , they can be viewed as consistent with the previously reported drop below q@xmath38 in the mass ratio distribution of binaries with main sequence f , g , k and m type primaries as determined from detailed radial velocity studies .",
