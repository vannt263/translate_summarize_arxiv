    "recently , the isolation of graphene monolayers from bulk graphite has inspired many studies @xcite , including those related to optical and opto - electronical applications @xcite .",
    "findings show that photon propagation can be better controlled in materials with increasing nonlinear optical susceptibility @xcite , which allows formation of temporal and spatial electro - magnetic ( em ) solitons @xcite .",
    "such structures are of high interest in optical communications . in the optical regime ,",
    "nesterov and co - workers nesterov have used finite element modeling ( fem ) to demonstrate that 2d graphene monolayers can support such a quantum phenomenon in the absence of defects .",
    "however , more realistically the graphene will have inhomogeneties in various parameters such as the interaction .",
    "such parameter deviation can cause optical scattering , leading to loss of the optical soliton for large propagation distances .",
    "it is our understanding that such deviation in the parameters is rather difficult to simulate using finite element methods as they induce numerical instabilities , particularly for strong spatial variations .",
    "the motivation of this study is to employ our recently developed generalized finite - difference time - domain ( g - fdtd ) method @xcite to solve a non - homogenous vector helmholtz equation analogue .",
    "the g - fdtd scheme was developed for solving linear and nonlinear schrdinger equations @xcite .",
    "it is explicit , permits an accurate solution with simple computation , and also satisfies a discrete analogue of the mass conservation law for nonlinear schrdinger equations . in this study , we will use the g - fdtd method to simulate graphene imperfections in a free - standing configuration , permitting an analysis of the robustness of the optical soliton propagation .",
    "we will investigate whether or not these optical solitons propagate with great stability in the presence of very large spatial inhomogeneties .",
    "this will illustrate the effectiveness of the monolayer configuration for optical soliton propagation and allow us to examine the robustness of the soliton propagation under non - ideal conditions .",
    "in this study , we consider a single graphene monolayer placed inside a planar linear dielectric waveguide , as shown in figure 1 . the vertical confinement along the @xmath0axis provides a direction for the propagating em mode .",
    "we assume that graphene is a thin film of thickness @xmath1 on the order of nanometers .",
    "as seen in figure 1 , a three - dimensional free standing graphene monolayer configuration will yield the same results described by two - dimensional conductivity .",
    "hence , the photon propagation of light inside the nonlinear monolayer can be expressed as the non - homogeneous vector helmholtz s equation as follows @xcite : @xmath2 \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\mathbf{j}_{nl}(\\mathbf{r},t ) ,   { \\label}{1}\\]]where @xmath3 is the magnetic potential vector , and @xmath4 is the linear refractive index of graphene . to solve eq .",

    "it is of interest to study such graphene impurities to determine whether or not such deviations of the interaction parameter @xmath27 induce optical scattering of the propagating soliton , especially in the case of large propagation distances .",

    "it was found that optical solitons can travel in such monolayers taking advantage of the natural nonlinearity that is present in these materials .",
    "our simulations indicate that even in the presence of defects , the solitons can travel large distances with the overall shape of the solitons being unchanged beyond local variations at the defect position .",
    "this can be interpreted to be caused by the beneficial effects of the nonlinearity .",
    "the nonlinear interaction gives a suppressed scattering due to an effect analogous to superfluidity .",
    "this allows the optical soliton to propagate even in the presence of the defects , which would otherwise destroy the soliton due to multiple backscattering events .",
    "these results show that beyond the self - guiding nature of the nonlinear monolayer , such materials are beneficial as they are rather robust even in the presence of graphene imperfections .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed using the recently developed g - fdtd method for solving an analogue of the non - homogeneous vector helmholtz s equation .",
