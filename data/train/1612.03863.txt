    "many physical processes can be modeled by parabolic differential equations such as heat diffusion , flow in porous media , and ocean acoustic propagation .",
    "some control methods have also been developed and depending on where the actuators are placed , the control methods can be distinguished as boundary control and in - domain control",
    ". a successful control design for in - domain control has been developed by @xcite . in many applications ,",
    "however , boundary control is generally considered to be physically more realistic since actuation and sensing are usually located at the boundaries .",
    "it is also a harder problem compared to an in - domain control since the input and output operators are unbounded operators .    in control literatures , the boundary control problems for parabolic",
    "pdes are subject to different approaches , e.g. , finite - element approximation was proposed by @xcite , a semigroup approach was proposed by @xcite , while @xcite studied null - controllability of the boundary control problem .",
    "a more recent result on tracking control for boundary controlled of parabolic pdes can be found in @xcite .",
    "a systematic method for boundary control of pdes was developed by @xcite .",
    "the method is called backstepping and is primarily used for nonlinear ode systems in strict - feedback form .",
    "thus , the method represents a major shift from finite - dimensional to infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "the backstepping method has been successfully used as a tool for control design and state estimation of many type of linear pdes such as transport equation ( @xcite ) , wave equation ( @xcite ) , kortweg - de vries equation ( @xcite ) , and a more relevant to the present paper is the reaction - diffusion equation ( parabolic type of pdes ) .",
    "the method is also has been extended to nonlinear parabolic systems with volterra nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "the method uses change of variable by shifting the system state using a volterra operator .",
    "a property of volterra operator is that the state transformation is triangular which ensures the invertibility of the change of the variable .",
    "furthermore , using method of successive approximation @xcite or marcum q - functions @xcite one may found an explicit expression for the transformation kernel .",
    "thus , the feedback law can be constructed explicitly and the closed - loop solutions can be found in closed - form .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the problem is stated in section ii . in section iii , using the backstepping method , we derived a state - feedback control law and proving exponential stability of the closed - loop system . in section iv , we present our boundary observer and prove convergence of observer estimates to the real states .",
    "furthermore , two cases are considered .",
    "the first case is when the sensor and the actuator are placed at different boundary ( anti - collocated setup ) and the second case is when both of them are placed at the same boundary ( collocated setup ) . in section",
    "v we combine the full - state feedback control law and the observer to obtain an output - feedback control law .",
    "the well - posedness of the kernel equations is presented in section vi . finally ,",
    "conclusions are stated in section vii .",
    "we consider output - feedback stabilization problems for a class of two - component linear parabolic systems @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "systems ( [ main1 ] ) arise naturally in systems consisting of two interacting components and widely used to describe phenomena in variety of biological , chemical , and physical systems .",
    "for instance , ( [ main1 ] ) can be used to model turing instability @xcite , instability of slime mold amoebae aggregation @xcite , and chemical reaction of two components @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions are given as and @xmath6 will be used to denote vectors with all entries 0 and 1 , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are control laws which should be designed such that the equilibrium of the system ( [ main1 ] ) is exponentially stable in some norms ( e.g. , the @xmath10-norm ) .",
    "the main idea of the backstepping method is to design control law by mapping the original system ( [ main1 ] ) into the so - called target system .",
    "the coordinate transformation is invertible so that the stability of the target system translates into stability of the closed - loop system consisting of the plant plus boundary feedback @xcite . in this case",
    ", we choose the following target system    @xmath11    where @xmath12 . using lyapunov stability analysis , it is easy to show that for any initial condition @xmath13 , the equilibrium of the target system ( [ maint1 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ tbc1 ] ) is exponentially stable in the sense of @xmath10-norm .",
    "note that using separation of variables it is also easy to obtain the explicit solution of the target system .      to map the original system ( [ main1 ] ) into the target system ( [ maint1 ] ) , we use the following integral operator state transformations @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "substituting transformation ( [ trans1 ] ) into target system ( [ maint1])-([tbc1 ] ) , using plant equation ( [ main1])-([bc2 ] ) , and integration by parts , one obtains the equations that the kernels must satisfy @xmath16 where @xmath17 note that , this system evolving on triangular domain @xmath18 since boundary condition ( [ gau ] ) is on the characteristic ( goursat - type ) .      to ensure the target system and the closed - loop system have equivalent stability properties , integral transformation ( [ trans1 ] ) has to be invertible . in our case ,",
    "the inverse is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "again , substituting transformation ( [ invtrans1 ] ) into target system ( [ maint1])-([tbc1 ] ) , using plant equation ( [ main1])-([bc2 ] ) , and integration by parts , one obtains the equations that the inverse kernels must satisfy @xmath21 where @xmath22 existence of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given in section 6 .",
    "if the integral transformation ( [ trans1 ] ) evaluated at @xmath25 , we get @xmath26 this control law is our full - state feedback control law which requires the measurement of the state at each point in the domain . the summary of this section is stated in the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath27 be the solution of ( [ ker1])-([bcker6 ] ) .",
    "then for any initial condition @xmath28 which compatible with boundary condition ( [ bc2 ] ) , system ( [ main1 ] ) has a unique classical solution @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , the origin , @xmath30 , is exponentially stable in the @xmath10-sense",
    ".    the well - posedness problem can be solved by showing the transformation kernel @xmath27 and the inverse kernel @xmath31 are exists .",
    "this is discussed in section 6 where we show there exists a continuous twice - differentiable function @xmath27 that satisfies ( [ ker1])-([bcker6 ] ) .",
    "remark that since the target system is exponentially stable in the @xmath10-norm , then there exists @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34 since the kernels are continuous , define the following upper bounds @xmath35 @xmath36}\\|k(x , y)\\|_2 ^ 2\\\\ l_{\\infty}^2&=&\\max_{x , y\\in[0,1]}\\|l(x , y)\\|_2 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ invtrans1 ] ) , we have @xmath37 which concludes the proof .",
    "since the state - feedback control law ( [ con1 ] ) requires measurements of the state at each point in the domain , we need to design a state observer .",
    "we consider two setups : the anti - collocated setup ( when sensor and actuator are placed at the opposite ends ) and the collocated setup ( when sensor and actuator are placed at the same ends ) .",
    "let s assume that only @xmath38 is available for measurement .",
    "using this boundary information , it is possible to reconstruct the state in the domain . following @xcite ,",
    "the observer is designed for the plant is as follow @xmath39 where @xmath40 . here , the functions @xmath41 , and the constant @xmath42 are observer gains to be determined .",
    "remark that the state observer is just the plant plus output injection .",
    "the objective now is to find those gains such that @xmath43 converges to @xmath44 as time goes to infinity . to this end , consider the following error system @xmath45 using the following ( invertible ) transformation @xmath46 where @xmath47 , we transform the error system into the following exponentially target system @xmath48 by plugging the transformation ( [ acoltrans1 ] ) into the error system ( [ anerror1])-([anerrorbc4 ] ) , using the target system ( [ targ1])-([bctarg1 ] ) , and integration by parts , the kernels must satisfy the following system @xmath49 where @xmath50 the gains are given by @xmath51 hence , we can state the following theorem .",

    "we combine it with the backstepping controller developed in section 2 to solve the output - feedback problems .      for anti - collocated setup",
