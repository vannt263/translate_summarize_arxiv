    "the development of experimental techniques has made possible to trap samples of atoms using resonant exchanges of momentum and energy between atoms and laser light @xcite .",
    "this progress has been accompanied by the development of the interdisciplinary fields of quantum computation and quantum information @xcite .",
    "the study of open quantum systems is an outstanding topic of quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular the transition form the quantum to the classical world has intrinsic importance .",
    "on the other hand the advent of quantum computation makes of decoherence a central problem in the interaction of the quantum computer with its surroundings .",
    "simple theoretical and experimental models such as the quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) and the quantum walk ( qw ) may play an important role in this frame .",
    "although the existent experiments have high accuracy in both coherent storage and manipulation of the atoms , the interaction with the surroundings introduces different degrees of decoherence influencing the unitary evolution of the system .",
    "the qkr is a milestone in the study of chaos at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the qkr depends on whether the period of the kick is a rational or irrational multiple of @xmath0 ( in convenient units ) @xcite . for rational multiples",
    "the behavior of the system is resonant with ballistic spreading and has no classical analog , its standard deviation @xmath1 has the time dependence @xmath2 . for irrational multiples",
    "the average energy of the system grows in a diffusive manner for a short time and then dynamical localization take place .",
    "the quantum resonances and the dynamical localization of the qkr have been experimentally observed in samples of cold atoms interacting with a far - detuned standing wave of laser light @xcite and in particular the secondary resonances have been recently observed by kanem et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the qkr as a simple toy model allows to study the complexity of decoherence both analytically and numerically , these studies have a @xmath3 year - old history @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the first experimental observation of environment induced decoherence in the qkr was reported by ammann et _ al .",
    "_ @xcite .    in this line we recently investigated the qkr in resonance subjected to : a ) decoherence with a lvy waiting - time distribution @xcite and b ) an excitation that follows an aperiodic fibonacci prescription @xcite . in both cases",
    "we find that the secondary resonances have a sub - ballistic behavior ( @xmath4 ) , while the principal resonances maintain the well - known ballistic behavior .",
    "these results are very surprising since one expects diffusive behavior when decoherence occurs .",
    "other authors also investigated the qkr subjected to noises with a lvy distribution @xcite and almost periodic fibonacci sequence @xcite , showing that this decoherence never fully destroys the dynamical localization of the system , but leads to a sub - diffusion regime for a short time before localization appears .",
    "in this work we want to study the decoherence effect of an unitary operation described by kraus operators @xcite acting on the density matrix .",
    "our route is similar to that followed by brun _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite with the qw but our results in the qkr are very different .",
    "in this section we briefly review the dynamical equations for the qkr @xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath5 where the external kicks occur at times @xmath6 with @xmath7 integer and @xmath8 the kick period , @xmath9 is the moment of inertia of the rotor , @xmath10 the angular momentum operator , @xmath11 the strength parameter and @xmath12 the angular position . in the angular momentum representation , @xmath13 , the matrix element of the time - step evolution operator",
    "@xmath14 is @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the @xmath18th order cylindrical bessel function and its argument is the dimensionless kick strength @xmath19 . the resonance condition does not depend on @xmath20 and takes place when the frequency of the driving force is commensurable with the frequencies of the free rotor . inspection of eq.([evolu ] ) shows that the resonant values of the scale parameter @xmath21 are the set of the rational multiples of @xmath0 , @xmath22 @xmath23 . in what follows we assume , that the resonance condition is satisfied , therefore the evolution operator depends on @xmath20 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we call a resonance primary when @xmath23 is an integer and secondary when it is not .",
    "in order to generate the dynamics of the system we consider that the decoherence is introduced through a completely positive map , that is defined by a set of kraus operators @xmath26 @xcite . to preserve the trace of the quantum operation these operators satisfy @xmath27let us take two values of the strength parameter @xmath28 : @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the corresponding time step operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 are used to define @xmath33@xmath34as a particular set of kraus operators , where @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ kraus ] ) .",
    "then the following map for the time evolution of the density matrix is proposed @xmath37where @xmath7 indicates the time @xmath6 . when @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) vanishes eq.([map ] ) reduces to the well known evolution of the usual kicked rotor in quantum resonance .",
    "in other cases @xmath38 ( or @xmath40 ) may be thought as the probability per time - step to apply the operator @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) to the density matrix .",
    "we shall study the previous map in the case when the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 commute ( @xmath43 = 0 $ ] ) , as is the case in the primary resonances , in what follows we use the principal resonance for simplicity . in this case",
    "it is easy to prove , using mathematical induction , that the solution of the map eq.([map ] ) is @xmath44where @xmath45 .",
    "it is important to point out that eq.([rhon ] ) is a generic solution of eq.([map ] ) for any couple of unitary operators that commute .",
    "this means that the solution of the map is independent of the details of the model .     as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath7 in log - log scales for @xmath46 .",
    "the coherence was calculated , from top to bottom , for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the straight stretches with slopes @xmath51 show a power law behavior @xmath52    the probability for the angular momentum value @xmath53 at time @xmath7 is @xmath54 . we shall calculate this probability for the first principal resonance .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are expressed as @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 . then using the above equation eq.([rhon ] ) with the initial condition @xmath58",
    "the probability is @xmath59where @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "the moments of the angular momentum are @xmath63we want to study the time behavior of the variance @xmath64 .",
    "the first moment vanishes due to the symmetry of the initial condition @xmath65 . using the properties of the bessel functions ,",
    "the following value for the variance is obtained @xmath66 .",
    "\\label{sigma}\\]]in the case when @xmath67 the system reduces to the usual kicked rotor in resonance and its variance has the well known ballistic behavior characteristic of this case @xcite . when @xmath68 the coherence of the system is lost , as it is shown below , because the probabilistic map is effectively working .",
    "eq.([sigma ] ) leads us to some interesting results .",
    "it shows that the ballistic behavior is maintained with this decoherence ; but additionally there appears the diffusive term @xmath69 .",
    "in particular if the parameters verify @xmath70 , the behavior of the variance is totally diffusive as in the classical random walk .",
    "then we can conclude that this decoherence always affects the behavior of the variance but , in general , does not break its ballistic growth .",
    "the degree of coherence of the system can be measured by several means .",
    "we choose the following : @xmath71substituting eq.([rhon ] ) in the above equation , and using the properties of the bessel function the equation for the coherence is obtained @xmath72where @xmath73 , with @xmath74 . from eq.([cohe2 ] ) is easy to prove that @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 , but in general this equation will be difficult to reduce to a more simple expression .",
    "however we can get some additional information when @xmath78 is very large . in this case",
    "@xmath79 goes to zero , except when @xmath80 because @xmath81 .",
    "then in this limit eq.([cohe2 ] ) reduces to @xmath82here we observe the interesting result that the coherence is independent of the strength parameters of the system if @xmath83 is sufficiently large .",
    "we made numerical studies of the long - time behavior for eq.([cohe2 ] ) as a function of the parameter @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ trace1 ] the function @xmath84 is plotted for large @xmath83 and different values of @xmath38 .",
    "this figure shows a power law decay for the coherence @xmath85 independently of the value of @xmath86 .",
    "the same results were obtained using eq.([cohe3 ] ) .",
    "therefore in eq.([cohe3 ] ) we may choose a particular value of @xmath38 to calculate its long - time decay .",
    "taking @xmath87 and using the sums of the binomial coefficients we obtain @xmath88for large @xmath7 is possible to use the stirling formula to obtain analytically the following expression for the coherence @xmath89 confirming our numerical result .",
    "we also studied the coherence for several smaller values of @xmath83 .",
    "we obtained that for each fixed value of @xmath78 the coherence always decays as the power law @xmath90 with @xmath91 ( see fig .",
    "[ trace3 ] ) .",
    "additionally we observed that the exponent @xmath92 is always independent of @xmath86 like in fig .",
    "[ trace1 ] , therefore @xmath92 only depends on @xmath93 .",
    "we observe that the exponent @xmath92 grows with @xmath78 with its values in the interval @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "we can conclude that the qualitative behavior of eq.([cohe2 ] ) and eq.([cohe3 ] ) are the same for all values of @xmath78 .     as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath7 for @xmath95 in log - log scales .",
    "for large @xmath7 the curve satisfy a power law @xmath96 .",
    "the parameters of the curves , from top to bottom , are ( 1 ) @xmath97 and @xmath98 , ( 2 ) @xmath99 and @xmath100 , ( 3 ) @xmath101 and @xmath102 , ( 4 ) @xmath103 and @xmath104     as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath7 . the parameters are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 in all cases . dashed line @xmath47 ( @xmath108 ) , thick line @xmath48 ( @xmath109 ) , thin line @xmath50 ( @xmath110 ) . ]",
    "now we inquire the incidence of decoherence on the secondary resonances . in this case",
    "the commutativity between the evolution operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 is lost and the expressions for the variance and the density matrix become very cumbersome . then we study the decoherence numerically using eq.([map ] ) for several values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath86 .    in fig .",
    "[ trace4 ] the standard deviation @xmath1 is presented , for fixed values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 and for different values of @xmath86 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath1 has power - law decay with an exponent @xmath113 that depends on @xmath86 .",
    "this parametric dependence is very different from that given by eq.([sigma ] ) in the primary resonances where @xmath114 .",
    "the values of @xmath113 were adjusted for the last thousand values of @xmath7 and we found that they are near @xmath114 . for other values of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath86 the exponent @xmath113 varies between @xmath115 and @xmath116 . considering all the cases",
    "studied we conclude that the exponent @xmath113 does not show a clear rule of dependence with the parameters .",
    "the numerical study of the coherence @xmath84 , for the same range of values of the parameters as for @xmath1 , showed that its time decay is better approximated by an exponential than by a power law , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath117 with @xmath118",
    ". therefore the coherence of the system in the secondary resonances is lost faster than in the primary ones .",
    "decoherence in quantum systems as qkr or qw has been extensively studied .",
    "analytical and numerical results @xcite on the effect of different kinds of noise have shown that quantum properties are highly sensitive to random events .",
    "in particular the linear increase of the standard deviation @xmath2 can be eventually substituted by a diffusive behavior @xmath119 as in the classical random walk .",
    "the linear increase of the standard deviation of the qkr in resonance is usually accepted as a direct consequence of the quantum coherence , in other words , a consequence of the unitary evolution .",
    "this work shows explicitly that unitary decoherence does not break the temporal linear increase of @xmath1 .",
    "the absence of diffusive behavior in presence of decoherence has already been shown in our previous works @xcite .",
    "there we have studied the qkr subject to different types of noise with a lvy waiting time distribution and we found that the system has a sub - ballistic wave function spreading and its standard deviation has a power - law tail .",
    "however in that opportunity the coherence had not been studied .",
    "here we have considered a new type of decoherence in the qkr as an unitary map acting on the density matrix .",
    "we obtain an analytical expression for the density matrix when the kraus operators commute .",
    "we prove that the decoherence affects the variance but its ballistic growth persists in spite of an additional linear term .",
    "therefore asymptotically the linear behavior of the standard deviation is not suppressed by the noise . on the other hand",
    "the coherence @xmath84 has a power - law decay for all values of the parameters .",
    "we want to underline that the density matrix eq.([rhon ] ) , solution of eq.([map ] ) only depends on the commutativity of the unitary operators @xmath120 , @xmath121 and it is independent of their detail .",
    "this allows to extend the use of this expression for other quantum models such as the qw . in previous works",
    "@xcite we have established a parallelism between the qkr in resonance with the discrete qw . then the type of treatment presented in this paper could be applied to the qw .",
    "when the kraus operators do not commute we have not usable analytical expressions , it is necessary to make numerical studies .",
    "we establish that : a ) the standard deviation has no simple dependence with the parameters of the system , b ) the standard deviation has ( in the long - time limit ) a continuous range of behaviors from diffusive to ballistic and c ) the coherence @xmath84 shows a exponential law decay .",
    "we can conclude that the effect of decoherence of the type studied in this work does not necessarily transform our quantum system into a dissipative system such as a markov process . in more general terms ,",
    "the mere presence of noise does not assure the passage from the quantum to the classical world ."
