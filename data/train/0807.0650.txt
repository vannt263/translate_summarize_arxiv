    "indications that such a compensation may , indeed , be at work are provided by ( i ) the lack of agreement between the values for @xmath104 obtained from the separate aleph v and a analyses  @xcite , ( ii ) the fact that the central fitted values of @xmath104 obtained in the v , a and v+a cipt analyses of both groups are uniformly lower than of the updated charmonium sum rule analysis of ref .",

    "given the @xmath175 tolerance in the sum of @xmath134 relative to @xmath59 contributions required for a @xmath95 determination of @xmath8 , the neglect of @xmath12 contributions appears to us to represent a rather strong assumption .    a quantitative test of whether or not such contributions can , in fact , be safely neglected _ for all of the weights employed in the aleph and opal analyses _ can be obtained by studying the quality of the fitted ope representations of the @xmath176-weighted spectral integrals as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the utility of this test follows from the fact , already noted above , that integrated contributions of different @xmath84 scale differently with @xmath44 .",
    "thus , if the fitted values of @xmath0 , @xmath104 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are unphysical as a result of shifts induced by the need to compensate for missing @xmath12 contributions in one or more of the fesrs employed , the fact that this compensation occurs in lower dimension contributions , which scale more slowly with @xmath44 than do the contributions they are replacing , will show up as a deterioration of the fit quality as @xmath44 is decreased below the single value @xmath50 used in the aleph and opal analyses .",
    "in contrast , were the fit quality to be maintained at lower @xmath44 , this would provide significant evidence in support of the prescription of neglecting @xmath12 contributions in the set of fesrs employed in those analyses .",

    "one should bear in mind that strong correlations exist between the @xmath181 for fixed @xmath40 but different @xmath44 , and similarly between the @xmath182 for fixed @xmath40 but different @xmath44 .",
    "because of these correlations , the assumption that @xmath12 ope contributions are safely negligible corresponds to the expectation that @xmath183 should remain less than @xmath184 for a range of @xmath44 below @xmath46 , _ and for all of the @xmath40 employed in the analysis in question_. it turns out that neither the aleph nor the opal fits satisfy this expectation .    to illustrate this point",

    "the strength of the test is enhanced in this case because the factor @xmath148 in the weight leads to a significant suppression of the @xmath59 integral , making the @xmath200 fesr relatively more sensitive to @xmath134 contributions .",
