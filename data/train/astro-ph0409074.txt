    "the absolute magnitudes of these galaxies lie in the range @xmath35m@xmath36 .",
    "we also split the nearby sample into bright [ wgn_b , vgn_b ] ( @xmath37 , b = bright ) and faint [ wgn_f , vgn_f ] ( @xmath38 , f = faint ) sub - samples .",

    "large values of ew suggest high star formation .",
    "large h@xmath4 equivalent widths are directly related to high star formation rates , bluer colors and fainter absolute magnitudes ( kennicutt & kent 1983 ) .",

    "1986 ; broadhurst , ellis , & shanks 1988 ; colless et al .",
    "1990 ; broadhurst , ellis , & glazebrook 1992 ; koo & kron 1992 ) .",
    "we use the widths of the gaussian fit to the respective lines as measured by the sdss spectral pipeline ( spectro1d ; subbarao et al , 2004 ) . for the 4000  break strength we use , where possible , kauffmann et al s .",
    "( 2003 ; k03 ) estimates of this index ( d@xmath474000 ) .",
    "they use the ratio of the average flux density in narrow continuum bands ( 3850 - 3950 and 4000 - 4100  ) as suggested by balogh et al .",
    "d@xmath6 is an excellent indicator of past star formation on timescales of @xmath43gyr and is also insensitive to dust attenuation . for hot stars where elements are multiply ionized the opacity decreases",
    "therefore , hot , young stars ( e.g. , o and b ) have lower amplitudes of d@xmath6 than cooler , older stars ( e.g. , k and m ; see figure 3 , bruzual 1983 ) . since late - type galaxies are mainly composed of young stars , their 4000  break is smaller than for early - type galaxies which are primarily composed of older stellar populations .",
    "we compute the means and the errors on the mean of the distributions of ew s and @xmath48 s of void and wall galaxies .",
    "we also use the _ kolmogorov - smirnov _ ( ks ) test to examine whether the void and wall galaxies could be drawn from the same parent population based on the spectroscopic properties under consideration .",
    "tables 1 and 2 summarize the results of these tests for the nearby and distant samples respectively .",
    "we present results for the whole sample , as well as the samples split by absolute magnitude .",

    "the solid lines correspond to the void galaxies and the dotted lines to the wall galaxies .",
    "void galaxies have average ew(h@xmath4 ) of 19.14@xmath49 in the distant sample whereas wall galaxies have ew(h@xmath4)=11.77@xmath50 .",
    "the quoted errors are the error on the means and these will be quoted throughout . in the nearby sample ,",
    "the values are higher , ew(h@xmath4)=35.31@xmath51 ( void ) and 26.18@xmath52 ( wall ) .",
    "the values for ew([oii ] ) in the distant sample are 14.26@xmath53 ( void ) and 9.44@xmath54 ( wall ) .",
    "in all the distant samples , we find that void galaxies have on average larger ews than wall galaxies with differences in the means @xmath55 .",
    "in the nearby samples , the differences are around 2@xmath56 due to the smaller sample size .",
    "the statistical significance of the ew(h@xmath4 ) differences between void and wall galaxies is quantified through a ks test . for the distant samples it is very unlikely that the void and wall galaxies are drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath57 ) . in the case of the nearby samples",
    "only the faint sub - sample shows a larger probability ( @xmath58 ) of being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "we attribute this in part to the the decrease in number of galaxies in this sample .",
    "a further test that we do is to split the distant galaxies by morphology .",
    "galaxies with srsic index @xmath59 have surface brightness profiles that resemble spirals , where as galaxies with srsic index @xmath60 are more like ellipticals ( see rojas et al .",
    "2004 for the justification ) .",
    "in these cases , void galaxies also have statistically significant larger ews .",
    "from tables 1 and 2 we can see that there is a very low probability ( @xmath57 ) that the distributions of d@xmath6 of void and wall galaxies ( distant and nearby ) are drawn from the same parent population .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dn4000 ] we show the distributions of d@xmath6 for the void and wall galaxy samples .",
    "we can observe two noticeable features : ( 1 ) all samples of void galaxies have on average smaller d@xmath6 than wall galaxies and ( 2 ) there is an obvious deficit of early - type galaxies in the nearby samples which is observed in the amplitude of the distributions for d@xmath62 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of rojas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , where there were few galaxies with srsic and concentration indices typical of early - type galaxies .",
    "the lower values of d@xmath61 indicate that there is more recent star formation in the void galaxies .",
    "an alternative way of comparing the spectral properties of void and wall galaxies is to convert the spectral lines into estimated star formation rates ( sfr ) .",
    "this is discussed below in section [ sec : sfr ] .",
    "we also wise to compute the _ specific",
    "_ star formation rate , i.e. the sfr divided by the mass of the galaxy . for this , we obviously require masses and we discuss this first .      the integrated stellar masses for our 70% of our sample come from k03 s library of stellar masses .",
    "they estimate the stellar masses by taking the product of the model predicted @xmath63-band stellar - mass - to - light ratio ( m / l)@xmath64 and the respective dust - corrected luminosity of the galaxy . the model used by k03 to predict the ( m / l)@xmath64 and stellar masses is based on median likelihood estimates from their library of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories .",
    "30% of the galaxies are missing from k03 as they took galaxies from dr1 ( abazajian 2003 ) where as our sample is from a larger database ( blanton et al . 2002 ; sample10 ) .",
    "for these galaxies , we use the use the @xmath63-band absolute magnitude to estimate the mass as there is a nearly linear relationship between this and the logarithm of the estimated stellar mass in k03 .",
    "this relationship is shown in figure [ fig : fit ] .",
    "we can see that the scatter is well restricted to a narrow range about the line of best fit ( @xmath65 ) . using this fit we estimate we can measure typical stellar masses to within a factor of 5 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass ] we show the normalized histograms of the masses for all the samples .",
    "the differences between these distributions are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "it can be readily seen in the distant sample that on average void galaxies have smaller stellar masses than wall galaxies ( 10@xmath66 as opposed to 10@xmath67 ) .",
    "the ks test shows that it is very unlikely that void galaxies are drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath57 )",

    "the next step is to to compute the respective luminosity ( @xmath74 ) using : @xmath75\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the luminosity distance in units of [ cm ] .",
    "finally , using kennicutt s ( 1998b ) formula for the h@xmath4 flux valid in the case b recombination ( osterbrock 1986 ) with a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function , we compute the sfr using @xmath77.\\ ] ] and for [ oii ] we use kennicutt s ( 1998 ) calibration @xmath78.\\ ] ]    however , each of these steps is more complicated than it seems as there are several corrections that must be accounted for .",
    "these include stellar absorption corrections , aperture effects , dust and smearing .",
    "we discuss each of these below .    following hopkins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we begin by applying the stellar absorption correction .",
    "this consists of correcting the observed balmer line equivalent width ( ew ) by a factor ( ew@xmath79 ) appropriate for the type of galaxy being studied .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2003 ) adopt a value of ew@xmath80  for their analysis of the sdss dr1 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) sample .",
    "miller & owen ( 2002 ) found that this correction varies from @xmath81 ( e type ) to @xmath82 ( extreme spirals ) . in our case",
    "a correction of ew@xmath83  is more appropriate for the morphological mix of our galaxies ( c. tremonti private communication ) .",
    "this correction is then converted to a flux correction via @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the observed line flux ( equation 1 ) and @xmath86 the corrected line flux .",
    "the next step is to correct the stellar absorption corrected flux @xmath86 for aperture effects . because emission detected through the @xmath87 fiber from a galaxy depends greatly on the redshift of the galaxy ( nearby a smaller area of the galaxy",
    "is detected and at greater distances a larger area can be detected ) we need to estimate the flux that would be measured in the @xmath87 fiber .",
    "this is accomplished by scaling @xmath86 by @xmath88 where m@xmath89 and m@xmath90 are the synthetic and petrosian k - corrected sdss @xmath91-band absolute magnitudes respectively .",
    "therefore , the stellar absorption and aperture corrected flux ( @xmath92 ) is @xmath93.\\ ] ]    by far the largest correction ( about a factor of 10 consists of accounting for obscuration by dust . here",
    "we apply the fitzpatrick ( 1998 ) parameterization and compute the color excess e(b - v ) from the balmer decrement given by @xmath94 $ ] where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the stellar absorption and aperture corrected h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 fluxes respectively and : @xmath97 significant underestimates of the derived sfrs would be expected if this effect were unaccounted for . in the case of sfrs derived from the [ oii ] line ,",
    "the situation is even more severe because of the larger variation of @xmath98 ( gallagher et al .",
    "1989 ; kennicutt 1992a ) .",
    "this implies that sfrs of ` dustier ' galaxies will have considerably larger corrections ( increase in flux ) than dust poor galaxies .",
    "we find that void galaxies are relatively dust poor and therefore , wall galaxies have the largest increase in flux due to reddening corrections .",
    "this corrections are quite significant : wall galaxies have an average factor of 13 increase in flux vs. void galaxies which have a factor of 9 increase after all the relevant corrections are applied .",
    "note that for @xmath99 we use the @xmath100-band absolute magnitude when estimating the aperture corrections .",
    "for all other fluxes the @xmath91-band is used . with an estimate of the color excess for each galaxy we can now de - redden the h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 and [ oii ] fluxes using the r - dependent galactic extinction curve of fitzpatrick & massa ( 1999 ) .",
    "the dust corrected @xmath92 is now substituted into equation 2 . to compute the respective absorption , aperture , and dust corrected luminosity from which the sfr is derived using equation 3 .",
    "our analysis also accounts for smearing in the sdss spectroscopic observing procedure ( stoughton et al .",
    "it consists of four minute spectroscopic observations performed while the telescope dithers for the purpose of correcting for light losses from the @xmath87 fiber aperture . for galaxies about 1/3 of their light",
    "is contained within the @xmath87 fiber aperture .",
    "although the systematic differences between smear corrected and original spectra are only about @xmath101 ( hopkins et al .",
    "2003 ) the increase in the reported flux is generally about a factor of 2 .",
    "fortunately this was accounted for by using the @xmath91-band petrosian magnitude in the aperture correction factor ( this essentially scales the spectrum to match the photometry which is more reliable ) .",
    "an inherent assumption is that the ew(h@xmath4 ) and reddening are constant across the whole galaxy .    in tables 1 and 2",
    "we summarize the results from the sfr estimates and compare the sfr normalized distributions for void and wall galaxies in figures [ fig : hasfr ] ( sfr(h@xmath102 ) ) and [ fig : o2sfr ] ( sfr([oii ] ) ) . as noted above , sfr([oii ] ) can only be determined from the distant sample as [ oii ] does not appear in the spectra of most of the nearby sample of galaxies .",
    "in the distant sample , the wall galaxies have slightly higher sfr than the void galaxies ( 0.747@xmath103 vs. 0.734@xmath104 for h@xmath4 and 0.488@xmath105 vs. 0.448@xmath106 for [ oii ] ) .",
    "however , in the nearby sample , the void galaxies have slightly higher sfr than the wall galaxies .",
    "note carefully that comparing sfrs is a little misleading though as the void galaxies are known to be fainter than the wall galaxies and have smaller masses ( section [ sec : mass ] ) and thus would not be expected to have as high sfrs .",
    "a fairer comparison is to use the specific star formation rate , which we discuss below .",
    "note that when computing the means , errors on the means , and the ks statistic we include the negative sfrs in all the calculations .",
    "negative sfrs are obtained when either emission lines are seen as absorption lines or when the strength of the line is too weak and therefore , dominated by noise .",
    "the only sfrs that are not included are those for which an estimate of the color excess was not possible because @xmath107 .",
    "our samples of void and wall galaxies are reduced by about @xmath108 due to this restriction .",
    "the sfr per unit stellar mass ( s - sfr ) is perhaps a more informative spectral indicator for our purposes because void galaxies are on average less luminous and have smaller stellar masses .",
    "we estimate the s - sfrs using the stellar masses and the absorption , aperture , and dust corrected sfrs as discussed above .",
    "note that as above , we have the same caveat in our calculations , namely that the dust correction is a large effect .",
    "consistent with our analysis of the sfrs , we include negative s - sfrs in the calculation of the mean .",
    "neither the negative sfrs or negative s - sfr have a physical meaning , yet if we remove the @xmath109 of galaxies that have s - sfrs@xmath110 the results would have an artificial shift in the s - sfr distributions .    in figures [ fig : hassfr ] and [ fig : o2ssfr ]",
    "we show the s - sfr distributions for the h@xmath102 and [ oii ] lines respectively . in the distant samples ( bright and faint ) , including sub - samples split by srsic index , void galaxies have larger average s - sfrs(h@xmath102 ) and s - sfrs([oii ] ) than wall galaxies .",
    "the ks test shows that the probability of void and wall galaxies being derived from the same parent population is @xmath111 .",
    "thus , consistent with the results from the ews , void galaxies are forming more stars per unit mass than the wall galaxies .    an apparent exception to this picture is that wall galaxies in the faint nearby sample have higher sfrs and ssfrs than the void galaxies .",
    "however , the ews are the other way round ; void galaxies have stronger equivalent widths , although the differences are within 1 - 2@xmath71 .",
    "the photometric properties of these galaxies are also least distinct , the void galaxies are slightly bluer but the morphological properties are very similar ( rojas et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it is quite possible that the dust corrections applied to obtain the sfr are not applicable for this class of faint , @xmath112 , galaxies or it is possible that the wall galaxies in this category are also somewhat isolated . a detailed study of the individual galaxies and/or a larger sample that can be more finely split as a function of density is required to study this ground of galaxies in more detail .",
    "to recap , we find that in all cases , distant or nearby , bright or faint , that the void galaxies have higher ews than galaxies that reside in higher density regions . in most cases void galaxies also have higher ssfrs than wall galaxies . in any case ,",
    "equivalent width measurements are less affected by the large uncertainties than the sfr and ssfr calculations and , as such , are a more reliable indicator of the recent star formation histories of galaxies . in this section ,",
    "we see if these results are consistent with work from other groups .    the role of a galaxy s environment on star formation has long been studied .",
    "recent work has tended to focus on galaxies in environments that are more dense than the void galaxy sample that we present here .",
    "the exception is the work of grogin and geller ( 2000 ) , who probed the sfr - density relation using a sample of 150 galaxies with values of @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "46 of these galaxies had @xmath114 .",
    "they found that the strength of ew(h@xmath4 ) was 2 - 3@xmath71 stronger than that of galaxies at higher environments , consistent with our results .",
    "we are able to probe to even lower density environments and find that the trend continues even more strongly .",
    "balogh et al . ( 2004 ) also studied the strength of ew(h@xmath4 ) in a different range of environments , from groups to low density regions .",
    "they consider both projected and three - dimensional density estimates , the latter on scales of 1.1@xmath24mpc .",
    "they also find that the strength of ew(h@xmath4 ) increases as density decreases .",
    "they find that rather than the whole population increasing in h@xmath4 , it is the fraction of galaxies that show measurable h@xmath4 that dominates this increase .",
    "even so , in their most underdense environments , 30% of the galaxies still show very little , ew(h@xmath115 ) , emission .",
    "we find that 12 - 18% of the void galaxies have very little h@xmath4 emission .",
    "they also consider the density on scales of 5.5@xmath24mpc but due to a smaller data set , they examined the sdss edr , the results were limited .",
    "they suggested that on these larger scales , the difference between ew(h@xmath4 ) in void and wall regions might be greater , consistent with our results .    gmez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) go one step further and calculate sfrs and ssfrs as a function of density .",
    "they use a projected density estimate so a 1 - 1 comparison is difficult and they do not probe environments that are quite as underdense as those in this study .",
    "for example , the strongest h@xmath4 emitting galaxies have ew(h@xmath4 ) of 19 , which is the average value for our void sample . nevertheless , they also find that sfr increases as the project density decreases , although there is a large scatter .",
    "lewis et al . ( 2004 ) perform a similar analysis using the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey and find very similar results .",
    "gmez et al also examine whether the morphology density relation is the reason for this change in star formation .",
    "they find that late - type galaxies , as classified by the concentration index , have stronger sfr in lower density environments than in high density environments , consistent with our findings and results from hashimoto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , couch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and pimbblet et al .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also probe sfr as a function of density , although their lowest density bin includes more than 20% of galaxies , where as the void galaxy sample here includes only the lowest 5 - 8% of galaxies .",
    "the see similar trends of sfr with density , high star formation in the lowest density regions , but in contrast to balogh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and the results here , they claim that the trend in sfr only occurs on small , @xmath116mpc , scales .",
    "the observed photometric and spectroscopic properties of void galaxies generally agree with predictions from semi - analytic models of structure formation ( benson et al .",
    "2003 ) and scenarios where galaxy - galaxy interactions govern galaxy evolution .",
    "these models attempt to include feedback effects from star formation .",
    "void galaxies modeled in this fashion are bluer , more disk - like , and have higher specific star - formation rates than objects in denser regions .",
    "benson et al . ( 2003 ) find that the differences between void and wall galaxies in their simulations are due to the shift toward smaller mass of the halo mass function in voids .",
    "evidence for such a shift in the halo mass function is given by goldberg et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who estimate the halo mass function of our void galaxy sample and find that the best - fit theoretical mass function has mass underdensity @xmath117 , similar to the underdensity in galaxies .",
    "how do these results fit into the galaxy formation scenario ?",
    "one possibility is that void galaxies have formed recently and are young , hence the young stellar ages , low masses and the active star formation however , for galaxies to form in low density environments at all , they would have to form before the matter in the voids flowed out to the higher density regions .",
    "the relative blueness and active star formation of the void galaxies would be explained if the void galaxies consumed their gas supply at a slower rate than galaxies at higher density .",
    "using a sample of @xmath118 void galaxies from the sdss with density contrast @xmath23 , we are able to examine the environmental dependence of spectral properties of galaxies in extremely underdense regions .    we compare the equivalent widths of void and wall galaxies . using this simple approach , we find that void galaxies have larger equivalent widths of h@xmath4 , [ oii ] , h@xmath5 , nii and [ oiii ] .",
    "this is the case regardless of distance to the galaxy , brightness and morphological type .",
    "this would suggest that void galaxies have undergone recent star formation .",
    "void galaxies also show weaker balmer decrements , as measured by d@xmath6 , which indicates that the stellar population includes a higher fraction of o and b stars .",
    "thus , the emission line widths and continuum shape yield evidence of enhanced star formation over a range of timescales .    specific star - formation rates ( estimated sfrs normalized by the stellar mass of the galaxy ) of void galaxies are generally higher than for wall galaxies .",
    "un - normalized sfrs are similar or slightly higher for wall galaxies than void galaxies , but the void galaxies tend to have smaller stellar masses .",
    "these spectroscopic results corroborate the photometric evidence given by rojas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that void galaxies are bluer than wall galaxies of similar luminosity and morphology .",
    "thus , we show that the trend of increasing sfr with decreasing density , seen heretofore in denser regions , does indeed continue into the rarefied environment of voids .",
