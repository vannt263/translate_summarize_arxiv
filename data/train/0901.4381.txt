    "an enduring problem of crystallography is the inference of the internal structure of a crystal from physically measurable quantities , notably diffraction .",
    "perfect knowledge of the diffraction is equivalent to perfect knowledge of the @xmath1-point correlation of the structure .",
    "however , even perfect knowledge of the diffraction , or @xmath1-point correlation , is insufficient to pin down the structure of a crystal , with counterexamples going back to l.  patterson @xcite ( see @xcite for a good source of information on this subject ) .",
    "quasicrystals present the same problem , but are even more difficult . based on the theory of the covariogram , baake and",
    "grimm @xcite have given examples of model sets ( or cut and project sets , as they are often called ) , which are intrinsically different but have the same diffraction .",
    "one can ask whether knowledge of additional higher point correlations , notably the @xmath2-point correlation measure , could provide sufficient information determine the structure . but again , even for periodic structures , there are counterexamples @xcite . the main result of this paper ( thm .  [ main ] )",
    "however , is a positive result : in the context of regular model sets with real internal spaces , the @xmath1- and @xmath2-point correlations do determine the model set ( up to translation and to modification by sets of density @xmath0 ) .",
    "the possibility that in pure point diffractive sets ( of which regular model are good examples ) the @xmath1- and @xmath2-point correlations would suffice to know all the higher correlations was suggested by d.  mermin in a very interesting paper @xcite on a new approach to handling symmetry for quasicrystals .",
    "his ideas are based on the landau approach to second order phase transitions and involve rather informal manipulation of quantities which , as the author recognizes , can not be mathematically justified as given . to quote from that paper : _ ... this informal fourier space argument that the identity of all second and third order correlations implies the identity of all higher correlations is disarmingly trivial .",
    "i would very much like to learn of a comparably simple informal argument or an instructive counterexample in position space .",
    "_    in spite of thm .",
    "[ main ] , mermin s suggestion is not correct in general .",
    "this can already be seen in the periodic case from the results of @xcite , which we illustrate here in  [ pe ] in the form of periodic model sets . in  [ aperiodic ]",
    "we offer an example of a pair of aperiodic model sets , based on an internal space which is the direct product of a real line and a finite cyclic group , for which the @xmath1- and @xmath2-point correlations are identical but the point sets themselves can not be transformed into each other either by translation or inversion of their windows .",
    "the situation with more general internal spaces is , no doubt , difficult .",
    "even the simple case of a product of a real space and a finite group alluded to above is quite complicated .",
    "we touch on it here in  [ ce ] .",
    "although , as we have just pointed out , counterexamples can occur in this case , in other instances we can obtain a positive result .",
    "for instance , it is easy to see that the vertices of rhombic penrose tilings , which are model sets based on @xmath4 , are determined by their @xmath1-and @xmath2-point correlations .",
    "aperiodic sets are often studied in the context of dynamical systems and/or stochastic point processes .",
    "this approach was pioneered in @xcite and has been used extensively both in mathematical and physical models , @xcite .",
    "this applies particularly to regular model sets ( see  [ ms ] for definitions ) where things can be stated much more precisely , @xcite . instead of a single model set",
    "one considers its hull , namely the set of all uniformly discrete points sets that are in the closure of its translation orbit ( see  [ cpp ] for more details ) .",
    "this hull is then uniquely ergodic , and we may view it as describing a uniformly discrete ergodic point process .",
    "any such uniformly discrete point process ( with a common lower bound on the distance between closest points ) is characterized by knowledge of its entire set of moments ( second , third , etc.)@xcite .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath5th moment is equivalent to knowledge of the @xmath5-point correlation .",
    "thus our result about model sets with real internal spaces can be rewritten ( thm .",
    "[ mainpointprocess ] ) as the statement that for them only finitely many ( namely the second and third ) of these infinitely many moments are needed .    the main idea behind proving thm .",
    "[ main ] is to transfer the correlation problem to the internal space of the cut and project scheme defining the model sets .",
    "there the correlations are directly related to what have been called in @xcite the @xmath5-deck functions , or the covariogram in the case @xmath6 .",
    "these become tractable after fourier transformation , a fact that has been discovered several times before , see for example @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle is dealing with the set @xmath7 of zeros ( the _ extinctions _ in the diffraction ) of the fourier transform of the characteristic function of the window of the model set . here",
    "we offer prop .",
    "[ ppcharacter ] which we have not seen explicitly stated in the literature , which allows us to proceed as long as @xmath7 has no interior points .    finally in  [ cpp ]",
    "we point out @xcite which offers a different approach via spectral theory to determining uniformly discrete ergodic _",
    "pure point diffractive _ point processes by means of their moments . however , ultimately it too returns to similar problems about extinctions . for a short survey covering this and material on point processes ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we work in @xmath8 .",
    "the usual lebesgue measure will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the open cube of side length @xmath10 centred at @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath11 , so @xmath12 .",
    "a _ cut and project scheme _ for @xmath8 is a triple @xmath13 consisting of a compactly generated locally compact abelian group @xmath14 and a lattice @xmath15 for which the projection mappings @xmath16 and @xmath17 from @xmath18 onto @xmath8 and @xmath14 are injective and have dense image respectively :    @xmath19    then @xmath20 is isomorphic as a group to @xmath21 ( though it is rarely a discrete subgroup of @xmath8 ) and we have the composite mapping @xmath22 with dense image defined by @xmath23 .    the statement that @xmath21 is a lattice is equivalent to saying that it is a discrete subgroup of @xmath18 and that the quotient group @xmath24 is compact .",
    "notice that if @xmath25 then @xmath26 is a lattice in @xmath8 and we are back in the situation of normal periodic crystallography .",
    "thus the theory of model sets is a generalization of the theory of periodic sets and includes them as special cases .",
    "we let @xmath27 be a haar measure on @xmath14 , scaled so it gives measure @xmath28 to any fundamental region of @xmath21 in the space @xmath18 under the product measure @xmath29 .",
    "this is the same as saying that the naturally induced measure @xmath30 on @xmath31 is normalized so that @xmath32 .",
    "this normalization leads to the uniform distribution equation in the form given in thm .",
    "[ uniformdistribution ] below . and",
    "thereby introduce a multiplicative factor into .",
    "this amounts to corresponding variations by multiplicative factors in the correlations and frequencies in which we are interested , but has no intrinsic importance to what we are discussing here . ]    for @xmath33 , @xmath34    a set @xmath35 is called a _ window _ if @xmath36 for some compact set @xmath37 which satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "we shall often deal with families of windows based on a single @xmath39 .",
    "a _ model set _ or _ cut and project set _ is a set of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a window and @xmath42 .",
    "the model set is called _ regular _ if the boundary of @xmath41 ( or equivalently of @xmath39 ) has measure @xmath0 with respect to the haar measure of @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to see that for a fixed @xmath41 , @xmath43 depends only on @xmath44 , so we may write @xmath45 instead .",
    "the cut and project scheme @xmath46 together with a compact window @xmath39 is called _ irredundant _ if the equation @xmath47 implies that @xmath48 . when dealing with model sets it is always possible to adjust the cut and project scheme",
    "( by factoring out a subgroup of @xmath14 ) to get an irredundant cut and project scheme which defines exactly the same family @xmath49 , @xmath36 , though now @xmath39 is replaced by its image in the quotient of @xmath14 @xcite .    if @xmath46 and @xmath50 are irredundant cut and project schemes for the same model set ( or ones differing on sets of density @xmath0 ) then their internal spaces @xmath51 are isomorphic topological groups by an isomorphism that induces an isomorphism of the corresponding lattices in the obvious way .",
    "thus one may speak of _ the _ irredundant cut and project scheme of a model set .",
    "the proof of this essentially follows from the construction of @xmath14 given in ",
    "[ c2ms ] , see @xcite .",
    "we shall always assume that we are in the irredundant situation .",
    "model sets @xmath52 , regular or not , are delone subsets of @xmath8 , that is to say , there exist positive real numbers @xmath53 so that the cubes @xmath54 of side lengths @xmath55 and @xmath10 , no matter where they are translated to in @xmath8 , have at most one point of ( respectively at least one point of ) @xmath52 . since any model set @xmath56 also satisfies @xmath57 ( sets of differences ) and since @xmath58 is relatively compact ,",
    "we see that @xmath59 is also uniformly discrete , and by a similar arguments , all finite sets of sums and differences @xmath60 are also uniformly discrete .",
    "this is the _",
    "meyer _ property of model sets @xcite .",
    "model sets are uniformly distributed point sets :    @xcite [ uniformdistribution ] let @xmath61 be measurable and relatively compact . then , assuming the normalization of measures assumed in  [ ms ] . @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath30 almost surely . if the boundary of @xmath41 has haar measure @xmath0 then the result holds for all @xmath63 .    * remarks * :    * when we write @xmath64 we mean that we use a ( any ) discrete increasing sequence of positive real numbers @xmath65 .",
    "* in this paper we need to work with averaging sequences like the one in thm .",
    "[ uniformdistribution ] .",
    "the results here apply for any van hove sequence @xmath66 of subsets of @xmath8 satisfying the condition that there is a constant @xmath67 with @xmath68 . in the case of regular model sets , which are the main focus of this paper , all results quoted that depend on averaging ( frequencies , correlations ) are actually independent of which averaging sequence we use .",
    "this is a consequence of unique ergodicity . * in particular , although all averaging results in this paper are written with averages over @xmath11 , the centres need not be restricted to @xmath0 and cubes could be replaced by balls , etc .",

    "let @xmath69 be a regular model set with @xmath36 .",
    "then the frequency of @xmath73 in @xmath69 exists and @xmath76 for all @xmath63 .",

    "in this section we give examples of cut and project schemes and model sets from them for which the @xmath1- and @xmath2-correlations do not determine the window of the model set up to translation or inversion .",
    "for these sets the corresponding sets @xmath192 have interior points .      the most obvious way to make the sets @xmath192 have interior points is to use a compact internal space , for then @xmath247 is a discrete group . in the case",

    "the pattern frequencies for @xmath1- and @xmath2-point patterns of @xmath284 and @xmath285 are not altered when reduced@xmath286 , and hence are equal .",
    "assuming normalization so that the density of @xmath280 is @xmath28 , the appropriate volume function on @xmath287 is @xmath288 for all @xmath289 .",

    "however @xmath326 and so we have shown that @xmath313 and @xmath325 have the same @xmath2-point correlations ( and hence also equal @xmath1-point correlations ) . due to the different gap patterns produced by @xmath272 and @xmath273",

    "the frequency of @xmath334 in @xmath339 is the product of the frequencies of @xmath340 in @xmath39 and @xmath341 in @xmath337 .",

    "let @xmath346 be a non - empty relatively compact set satisfying @xmath347 and write @xmath348 let @xmath272 be the set of elements @xmath349 for which @xmath350 has a non - empty interior",

    "let @xmath357 denote the vanishing set of @xmath358 on @xmath359 .",
    "in order that @xmath358 vanish on a set with interior , we require that some of the @xmath357 have interior points . being analytic on @xmath360 , this requires @xmath361 and hence that @xmath362 as a function on @xmath8 .",
    "there are straightforward ways to make this happen .",
    "for instance , if all @xmath350 , @xmath363 , are equal then the requirement is simply that @xmath364 for some @xmath365 , which is certainly possible .",
    "this is what is going on in the examples above .",
    "the equation @xmath364 becomes @xmath366 where @xmath367 .",
    "this equation holds whenever @xmath368 is even and different from @xmath0 , since then the factor @xmath369 of @xmath370 evaluates to @xmath0 .",
    "similarly for @xmath273 .    on the other hand , for the penrose point sets arising from the penrose rhombic tiling , the vanishing set @xmath7 is indeed without any interior points . in this case",
    "the internal space is @xmath371 and the windows are the pentagons @xmath372 where @xmath373 is the convex hull of the @xmath374th roots of @xmath28 and the four listed windows are for congruence classes @xmath375 respectively @xcite .",
    "here it is easy to see that the zero condition can not possibly be satisfied .",
    "so rhombic penrose point sets _ are _ determined by their @xmath1- and @xmath2-point correlations .    one final comment .",
    "one can raise the bar and ask about examples with equal @xmath376-point or higher correlations .",
    "there are no examples of the type that we have produced here , because there are no finite cyclotomic sets like @xmath312 above which are translationally inequivalent but have equal @xmath376-point correlations , @xcite .",
    "however , extending the investigation to _ weighted _ point sets , there are examples with equal second through fifth point correlations , @xcite .",
    "start with the cut and project scheme .",
    "let @xmath35 be a window ( note the assumptions on windows , given in  [ ms ] ) for a model set @xmath254 in @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath377 .",
    "then @xmath70 is a delone set and there is a positive number @xmath55 so that its distinct points are separated by at least the distance @xmath55 . let @xmath378 be the family of all discrete subsets of @xmath8 whose points are separated by at least the distance @xmath55 .",
    "there is a uniformity on @xmath378 whose entourages are generated by the sets @xmath379 as @xmath380 vary over @xmath381 .",
    "the topology defined by this uniformity is a fell topology , and so @xmath378 is a compact hausdorff space ( @xcite , thm.1 ) .",
    "the translation action of @xmath8 on @xmath378 is continuous and the pair @xmath382 is a topological dynamical system @xcite .",
    "the _ hull _ @xmath383 of @xmath70 is the closure in this topology of the set of all translates of @xmath70 .",
    "it is clearly a compact subset of @xmath378 and is also translation invariant .",
    "thus @xmath384 is a dynamical system in its own right .",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath383 is uniquely ergodic .",
    "let @xmath385 denote the unique ergodic probability measure on it .",
    "there is a continuous @xmath8-equivariant mapping @xmath386 , called the _ torus parametrization _ , from the hull into the group @xmath31 of the cut and project scheme .",
    "the inverse image in @xmath383 of any point @xmath387 is made up of sets of the form @xmath388 for some set @xmath389 satisfying @xmath390 @xcite . if @xmath70 is a regular model set , then so are all the elements of @xmath383 .",
    "furthermore , assuming regularity , @xmath385-almost surely the inverse image of @xmath387 consists of just one point and it is @xmath391 .",
    "these elements are called _ non - singular _ elements of @xmath383 .",
    "see @xcite ,  5.3 for more details .    thus the point sets that make up @xmath383 are model sets and almost all of them are _ non - singular_. all of the point sets in @xmath383 have point correlations of all orders @xmath5 , and these @xmath5-point correlations are identical for all the elements of @xmath383 .",
    "thus we may speak of the @xmath5-point correlation of @xmath383 .",
    "there is an obvious mapping @xmath266 from the bounded measurable subsets of @xmath8 into @xmath392 defined by @xmath393 the mapping @xmath266 can be construed as an ergodic uniformly discrete point process , with @xmath394 being the expectation for the number of points in @xmath272 for a randomly chosen ( according to the law @xmath385 ) point set @xmath395 .",
    "the function @xmath266 extends naturally to a @xmath8-equivariant mapping @xmath396 defined by @xmath397 for all @xmath395 .",
    "following @xcite , there has been increasing interest in studying the mathematics of quasicyrstals by using ideas from the theory of point processes .",
    "although quasicrystals ( and model sets ! ) are , by their very nature , assumed to be highly ordered ( correlated ) , and hence quite atypical from the point of view of the theory of point processes , nonetheless the techniques of this theory are applicable and quite effective . for a more detailed and comprehensive exposition of this point of view",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there is a one - one correspondence between the correlation measures of a typical point set and the moment measures of the corresponding point processes @xcite ,  12.2 .",
    "the correspondence between the 2-point correlation and the first reduced moment measure was utilized by gour @xcite in his analysis of pure point diffraction and almost periodicity . in @xcite , we prove that an ergodic point process of uniformly discrete point sets is uniquely determined by its moments , or equivalently , all of its correlation measures .",
    "this implies that solving the inverse problem for quasicrystals ( i.e. determining the law of the corresponding point process ) is equivalent to knowing all of its @xmath5-point correlations . in this language",
    "we have from thm .  [ main ] :    [ mainpointprocess ]",
    "let @xmath383 and @xmath398 be point processes from regular model sets and suppose that their second and third moments are the same .",
    "then their cut and project schemes may be identified .",
    "if @xmath31 is the corresponding compact abelian group and @xmath399 are corresponding torus mappings , then for each @xmath63 the elements of @xmath400 and @xmath401 all differ from one another at most on sets of density @xmath0 .",
    "another approach to the way in which correlations link to the structure of the dynamics in the pure point case is given in @xcite . here",
    "the setting is a pure point ergodic uniformly discrete point process @xmath402 .",
    "the diffraction is almost always the same for the @xmath403 and it the fourier transform of the first moment of the palm measure of the process .",
    "the group @xmath404 generated by the set @xmath405 of positions of the bragg peaks is the fourier module of the process .",
    "there it is proved that if @xmath406 , where there are @xmath168 summands , then the point process is determined by the @xmath1- , @xmath2- ,  , @xmath407-point correlations .",
    "thus if there are no extinctions ( @xmath408 ) we need only the @xmath1- and @xmath2-point correlations .",
    "this result is not as strong as we have obtained here for real model sets with real internal spaces , since we have made no requirements on @xmath409 . on the other hand ,",
    "it goes well beyond model sets and works for general locally compact abelian groups , and furthermore suggests a fundamental role for the extinctions in understanding how much of the dynamics is controlled by the diffraction .",
