    "the interaction of light with matter triggers fundamental processes in systems as diverse as bulk semiconductors , quantum dots , photovoltaics , and living organisms .",

    "while the techniques of ultra - fast spectroscopy are central to studying the dynamics of photo - induced processes , such as the timescales and mechanisms underlying the initial step of photosynthesis in light - harvesting complexes , the interpretation of such experimental results and their relevance to natural excitation conditions has been questioned , due to differences between laser pulses and thermal light @xcite . in principle , systems such as light - harvesting complexes can be completely characterized using ultra - fast pulses , and their response to thermal - light excitation can then be inferred theoretically . however , understanding the relation of thermal light to pulses of light will make it possible to directly study the photodynamics of processes occurring under more natural excitation conditions by probing the system with ultra - fast pulses and then appropriately averaging the results according to the light decomposition .    in chenu _",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that the state of thermal light can not be written as a mixture of single broadband coherent states .",
    "yet because the experimental characterization of light can not be done directly but always involves some interaction with matter , we now focus our attention on states of light that reproduce some of the _ properties _ ( but not the full density matrix ) of thermal light .",
    "we start with the first - order correlation function , which characterizes effects of light at the level of a linear light - matter interaction @xcite .",
    "a finite - trace mixture of pulses can not even yield a first - order , equal - space - point correlation function matching that of thermal light , except in the unphysical limit that the amplitudes of the pulses would diverge as the observation volume @xmath0 .",
    "but by lifting the requirement of a finite trace and allowing the trace of the density matrix to scale linearly with the observation volume @xmath1 , we can mimic this property of thermal light by a mixture of pulses @xcite . here",
    "we provide the details of how to build these particular mixtures .",
    "we investigate the properties of such mixtures , and characterize the pulses that compose them .",
    "after some preliminary considerations in sections iia and iib below , in section iic we first consider a mixture of pulses with a gaussian lineshape , and find that such a decomposition is only possible for pulses with a fwhm on the order of thz or smaller  almost _ three orders of magnitude _ more narrow than what is physically expected from the coherence time of thermal radiation at the temperature of the sun . in section iid",
    "we then investigate a mixture without restricting the shape of the spectral distribution .",
    "we find a solution given by a family of pulses with a lineshape  and therefore coherence time  that itself mimics that of thermal light .",
    "the mean and spread of the energy and momentum of these pulses is considered in section iie .",
    "our conclusions , and comments on the relevance of these studies to problems in linear and nonlinear optics , are presented in section iii .",
    "recall that the density operator of a thermal state of light at temperature @xmath2 , in a normalization volume @xmath3 , is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , with @xmath6 boltzmann s constant , and @xmath7 is the field hamiltonian @xmath8here expressed in terms of a sum over modes with wavevector @xmath9 and polarization state @xmath10 ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation and annihilation operators , defined for discrete values of the wave vector , fulfilling the commutation relation @xmath13=\\delta _ { \\mathbf{k}\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime } } \\delta _ { \\lambda \\lambda ^{\\prime } } $ ] . in the coherent state basis ,",
    "the density matrix is given by the p - representation , @xmath14where @xmath15 , and where @xmath16 is the mean photon number in mode @xmath17 .",
    "( [ eq : prep ] ) provides a decomposition of a thermal state in terms of a product of mixtures of _ monochromatic _ coherent states @xmath18 .",
    "perhaps surprisingly  or perhaps not , depending on one s perspective ",
    "it is not possible to construct @xmath19 as a mixture of _ single _ _ broadband _ coherent states , i.e. , pulses @xcite .",
    "however , by relaxing the constraint that the trace of the density matrix is finite , we show below how to construct a density matrix from pulses that , while it is not equal to @xmath20 , still leads to a first - order , equal - space - point correlation function equal to that of thermal light .      to define a pulse of light it is convenient to consider normalization over all of space .",
    "that is , we quantize the electromagnetic field using annihilation and creation operators , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , where the helicity @xmath10 is positive or negative , the wave vector @xmath9 ranges continuously , and the commutation relations are",
    "@xmath23 = \\delta ( \\mathbf{k - k}^{\\prime } ) \\delta _ { \\lambda \\lambda ^{\\prime } } $ ] .",
    "we then define a pulse of light as a classical - like state of the electromagnetic with localized energy density , characterized by its nominal position @xmath24 , a spectral distribution @xmath25 , and other parameters   including those necessary to specify the polarization and the direction of propagation  that we label collectively by @xmath26 .",
    "the spectral distribution is normalized such that @xmath27with @xmath28 . to build the pulses , we construct generalized creation operator for a mode defined by the spectral distribution @xmath25 , @xmath29with @xmath30 = 1 $ ] , and describe a pulse by the quantum state @xmath31where",
    "@xmath32 is a ( complex ) amplitude and @xmath33 is the vacuum state , and we use @xmath34 to indicate the entire spectral distribution @xmath25 .",

    "they are coherent '' in the sense that they factorize correlation functions according to @xmath50 for all orders of @xmath51 , as defined by glauber @xcite ; here we use the superscript @xmath52 on @xmath53 to identify the state @xmath54 .  in particular , for such states we have the first - order correlation function @xmath55 where subscripts on field labels indicate cartesian components , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "we consider families of pulses such that , for a fixed set of properties @xmath26 , the pulses only differ by their nominal position @xmath24 .",
    "for such a family of pulses we have @xmath57and the associated @xmath58 depends on @xmath59 and @xmath24 only through its dependence on @xmath60 ; we will give particular examples of @xmath61 below , but for the moment we keep the function very general .",
    "nonetheless , we do assume that each member of the family is well localized in space at some nominal time @xmath62 , with @xmath63 as @xmath64 , and that the integral of @xmath65 over all space is finite .",
    "then for fixed @xmath59 the integral over all @xmath24 of @xmath65 will also be finite .       in chenu _",

    "the issue we wish to address here is :  how do we build such a mixture of pulses , characterized by @xmath76 , that correctly describes the first order , equal - space - point correlation function of thermal light , @xmath77 ?   that correlation function is given ( loudon2000,@xcite ) by @xmath78    to proceed , we take the set of parameters @xmath26 used to define our pulses to include a central wave vector @xmath79 of the pulse , with the unit vector @xmath80 identifying the main propagation direction , and a unit vector @xmath81 characterizing the polarization ; thus @xmath82 .",
    "next we specify a form for @xmath83 ( [ eq : f_general ] ) , and describe our pulses by @xmath84where @xmath85 is a real function , and @xmath86 is a normalization constant chosen such that @xmath83 is normalized .",
    "the convenience of this form can be most easily seen by looking at the expectation value ( [ general pulse ] ) of the positive - frequency part of the electric field operator @xmath87 for such a pulse , @xmath88where we have used @xmath89which holds since @xmath90 is necessarily perpendicular to @xmath9 and @xmath91where @xmath92 is the unit dyadic .",
    "note that while the use of any spectral function @xmath25 in ( general pulse ) would lead to a divergenceless expectation value @xmath93 , the form ( eq : k_general ) leads to an expression ( [ eq : e_general ] ) for @xmath93 in which the polarization vectors @xmath38 do not appear .",
    "further , we see that @xmath93 is centered in space at @xmath24 , and the direction of the vector field @xmath94 lies exclusively in the plane perpendicular to @xmath95 such that @xmath96 .",
    "thus @xmath95 identifies the polarization of the field @xmath94 , in that it defines the direction in which the pulse expectation value has _ no _ component .",
    "the correlation function for each pulse is given by ( [ eq : g1_pulse ] ) .  from the definition of @xmath97 in ( [ rhoimp ] )",
    ", we see that the correlation function for the mixture of pulses is given by the weighted sum of correlation functions for individual pulses .",
    "considering the choice of parameters @xmath26 , we explicitly write the integral over the set of parameters as @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , we assume a uniform distribution over pulse directions @xmath80 and ,  for a given @xmath80 , we consider an equal weighting of all @xmath95 perpendicular to @xmath80 . thus the probability distribution @xmath73 depends only on the magnitude of the central wave vector , @xmath99 , and the correlation function for the mixture becomes @xmath100    in the rest of this section , we investigate two different mixtures for which @xmath101 , and provide characteristics of the pulses involved .",
    "we first start with a mixture constrained by adopting a gaussian form for @xmath102 , and define the conditions under which the @xmath103 that results can represent @xmath104 . considering the restrictions found on the bandwidth of pulses that successfully fulfil this decomposition , we then lift the restriction of @xmath102 to a gaussian and propose another form .",
    "we take the pulses to be characterized by a gaussian form for @xmath102 , and label all properties related to this particular lineshape with the superscript ` @xmath105 ' . the spectral distribution ( eq : k_general ) is given by @xmath106where",
    "we define the real function @xmath107the normalization condition ( [ normalization ] ) on @xmath108 ( [ eq : f_general ] ) then leads to the normalization constant : @xmath109and the expectation value of the positive - frequency part of the electric field in such a pulse ( [ eq : e_general ] ) is given by @xmath110where the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath24 and @xmath26 is kept implicit .",
    "the first - order correlation function for the mixture ( eq : g1_mixture - general ) of such pulses is @xmath112when expressions ( [ e_gaussian ] ) for @xmath113 and @xmath114 are substituted into ( [ gaussiang ] ) there will be integrals over two wavevector variables , but the integral over @xmath24 will reduce it to an integral over only one remaining such variable @xmath9 .",
    "we do the integral over @xmath95 for a fixed @xmath115 , and then do the integrals over the direction @xmath115 and the direction of @xmath9 .",
    "details are given in appendix a ; the result is that ( [ gaussiang ] ) can be written in terms of only integrals over the magnitudes of @xmath116 and @xmath9 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively :   @xmath119with @xmath120where @xmath121 .",
    "we can build such a mixture with a correlation function @xmath122 equal to that of thermal light if there exists a non - negative function @xmath123 fulfilling @xmath124it is possible to search for solutions of ( [ eq : dgsfgd ] ) numerically , and we find a solution for pulses with a spectral fwhm on the order of thz or smaller , i.e. , pulses that are on the order of picoseconds in length or longer .",
    "but no physical solutions , with positive definite distributions @xmath123 , can be found for pulses with a bandwidth as broad as the thermal spectrum , i.e. femtosecond pulses .",
    "these pulses have a surprisingly narrow bandwidth , almost _ three orders of magnitude _ narrower than what is physically expected from the coherence time of the thermal radiation .",
    "the problem is that the gaussian shape ( eq : f_gaussian ) differs too much from the shape required to guarantee that the norm of the integrand of ( [ thermal1 ] ) is reproduced .",
    "thus the only way to reproduce the thermal @xmath125 is to choose the width @xmath126 in fourier space so small that , compared with the thermal spectrum , @xmath127 is essentially proportional to a dirac delta function ; then the function @xmath123 itself is relied on to capture the shape of that integrand .",
    "minor modifications of ( [ eq : f_gaussian ] ) could be considered , such as multiplying or dividing @xmath128 by powers of @xmath118 ; but we would expect this conclusion to hold even with such changes .    in an attempt to find a mixture consisting of pulses with a broader bandwidth , we lift the restriction on the shape of the spectral distribution . we find pulses that themselves match the spectrum of thermal light .",
    "we now investigate a mixture of pulses without initially restricting the shape of the spectral distribution ( [ eq : f_general ] ) .",
    "we consider all pulses to have the same lineshape and suppose that the set of parameters @xmath26 depends on the nominal wave vector @xmath116 only by depending on its direction , represented again by the unit vector @xmath129 .",
    "each pulse is then characterized by the set of parameters @xmath130 ; consequently @xmath131 is dimensionless and @xmath73 has dimension of @xmath132 .  in our mixture we will integrate over all possible @xmath115 and all allowable @xmath95 , and so @xmath133 , a constant .",
    "we label these pulses with the superscript @xmath134 for ` broadband ' and specify the spectral distribution ( [ eq : k_general ] ) by@xmath135with@xmath136where the function @xmath137 is chosen to characterize the spread in the direction of wave vectors in the pulse and should be peaked at @xmath138 for @xmath129 to represent the nominal direction of propagation of the pulse ; the function @xmath139 is now relied on to help capture the shape of the norm of the integrand in ( [ thermal1 ] ) .",

    "the coherence time of the pulse , as determined by its spectral fwhm , is the same as thermal light , which is approximatively @xmath153 fs for @xmath154 @xmath155 .",
    "the pulse energy is restricted by the condition that the product @xmath156 , where recall @xmath157 corresponds to the average number of photons in a coherent state , is fixed .",
    "because of the link of their spectrum to the thermal spectrum , we refer to these pulses as  thermal pulses \" .",
    "in this section we consider some elementary properties of these thermal pulses , represented by kets ( [ eq : ket_pulse ] ) @xmath158 , in the special case where the elements ( [ eq : k_general ] ) of @xmath159 are specified by @xmath160 ( [ f_broadband ] ) and @xmath161 ( [ n_broadband ] ) .  since these are the only pulses we consider in this section we avoid clutter in the notation by writing these kets simply as @xmath162 .",

    "this condition also ensures that such statistical mixture has the same energy density and photon density as thermal light .",
    "the spread in energy of the thermal pulse can be characterized by @xmath171 , which is given by @xmath172with details given in appendix b ; we find @xmath173 @xmath168 at @xmath154 @xmath155 .",
    "while thermal light has no directionality and is isotropic mandelwolfbook , each of our thermal pulses has a mean direction of propagation .",
    "we can characterize it by identifying the average momentum of the pulse .",

    "in the special case of ( [ special ] ) we find @xmath194the largest spread of momentum is in the direction @xmath115 the pulse is nominally propagating ; the spreads in the other two directions are almost but not identically the same .",
    "finally , while the energy density of thermal radiation is uniform , our pulses are localized in space .  in appendix",
    "b we give the details for calculating the expectation value ( [ e_broadband ] ) of the positive - frequency part of the electric field .",

    "much of the intuition of researchers in optical physics deals with how different states of light are related to each other .",
    "thermal light is well represented by a mixture of tensor products of coherent states describing monochromatic radiation , i.e. , continuous waves .  yet",
    "broadband coherent states , i.e. , pulses , are central to resolving the dynamics of physical processes .",
    "the relation between the two states of light involved here is especially relevant to the study of biological systems such as photosynthetic complexes , which under natural conditions are excited by thermal light , but which are probed in the laboratory with ultra - fast pulses .    in previous work @xcite",
    "we showed that thermal light can not be represented as an incoherent mixture of pulses , in contradiction to the intuition of at least some .",
    "here we showed that the intuition can be maintained if interest is restricted to first - order , equal - space - point correlation functions representative of linear light - matter interaction .",
    "we presented two families of pulses , mixtures of which can be used to reproduce the features of the linear interaction of matter with thermal light : ( i ) pulses with a gaussian lineshape , with surprisingly narrow bandwidths , ( ii ) and `` thermal '' pulses , with the coherence time of thermal light . in each case the density operator describing the mixture of pulses must be improper , in that its trace is not unity but rather scales with the volume containing the radiation .",
    "the decompositions presented in this paper may prove to be helpful conceptual tools , and useful in some calculations where localized pulses are easier to treat than radiation extending over all space .",
    "we also note that while thermal light is often used as a proxy for sunlight , thermal light and sunlight are strikingly different in that sunlight carries momentum while thermal light does not .",
    "so the kind of decompositions we present here might be of use in constructing mixtures to properly represent sunlight .",
    "the conclusion of our earlier work @xcite of course remains : nonlinear light - matter interactions involving thermal light , described by higher - order correlation functions , can not in general be described with the aid of mixtures of single pulses of the type presented in this paper .",
    "yet further work is required to investigate the existence of regimes where the use of such a mixture may be at least approximately valid .",
    "this should help in the development of conceptual and calculational tools for understanding and designing nonlinear optical experiments to study excitation by thermal light .",
