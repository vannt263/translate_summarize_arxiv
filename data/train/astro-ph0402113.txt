    "in roget s thesaurus , we find the following :    * mask : * [ noun ] screen , cloak , shroud .",
    "[ verb ] to camouflage , to make opaque , to disguise .",
    "optically thick dusty domains in galactic disks can completely camouflage or disguise underlying stellar structures . _",
    "cosmic dust grains act as masks_. the dust masks obscure whether or not the dust lies in an actual screen or is well intermixed with the stars .",
    "the presence of dust and the morphology of a galaxy are inextricably intertwined : indeed , the morphology of a galaxy can completely change once the population i disks of galaxies  the masks  are dust penetrated ( e.g. , block and wainscoat 1991 ; block et al .",
    ", 1994 , 2000 ) .",
    "the classification of galaxies has traditionally been inferred from photographs or ccd imaging shortward of the 1@xmath0 window , where stellar population ii disks are not yet dust - penetrated .",
    "images through an @xmath1 ( 0.8 @xmath0 ) filter can still suffer from attenuations by dust at the 50% level .",
    "the nicmos and other near - infrared camera arrays offer unparalleled opportunities for deconvolving the population i and ii morphologies , because the opacity at @xmath2  be it due to absorption or scattering  is always low .",
    "the extinction ( absorption+scattering ) optical depth at @xmath2 is only 10% of that in the v - band .",
    "many years before the advent of large format near - infrared camera arrays , it became increasingly obvious from rotation curve analyses that optical hubble type is not correlated with the evolved population ii morphology .",
    "this was already evident in the pioneering work of zwicky ( 1957 ) when he published his famous photographs showing the ` smooth red arms ' in m51 .",
    "in the _ hubble atlas _ and other atlases showing optical images of galaxies , we are looking at masks : at the gas , not the stars , to which the properties of rotation curves are inextricably tied .",
    "there is a fundamental limit in predicting what an evolved stellar disk might look like ( block et al .",
    "the greater the degree of decoupling , the greater is the uncertainty .",
    "the fact that a spiral might be flocculent in the optical is very important , but it is equally important to know whether or not driving the dynamics is a grand design old stellar disk .",
    "decouplings between stellar and gaseous disks are cited in many studies including grosbl & patsis ( 1998 ) , elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , block et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and puerari et al .",
    "the hubble type of a galaxy does not dictate its dynamical mass distribution ( burstein & rubin 1985 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by examining fourier spectra , for example , of the evolved disks of ngc 309 ( sc ) and ngc 718 ( sa ) ; these spectra are almost identical ( both belong to pitch angle type @xmath3 : see table 1 and fig . 5 in block and puerari 1999 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows how the stellar disks of galaxies can _ quantitatively _ be classified in a systematic way .",
    "one of the major processes which structures the interstellar media in galaxies is mechanical feedback : for example , supersonic winds from massive stars and multiple supernovae from ob associations .",
    "such mechanical feedback may generate wind - blown bubbles ( e.g. the rosette : block , 1990 ) .",
    "supernovae remnants as well super - bubbles ( in both ionised as well as neutral gas ) are two other well known examples .    the other major process that structures the interstellar medium on scales of 10 to @xmath4 500 pc is _",
    "turbulence_. the standard reference for turbulent power spectra is the kolmogorov model , applicable to homogeneous , isotropic , incompressible and adiabatic turbulence .",
    "there are , at present , no good theories about the morphology of density structures in _ compressible _ turbulence ; compressible turbulence gives a range of structures between incompressible turbulence and shocks . in a medium that is supersonically turbulent , the 2d power spectrum slope changes from -8/3 ( -2.67 ) to -3 ; it is very difficult , therefore , to distinguish incompressible from shock dominated turbulence , as the differential signature is not large .",
    "even the most extreme cloud formation scenarios , where all clouds represent shocks , would have a power spectrum similar to that of the classic kolmogorov incompressible model .",
    "self - gravitating clouds of gas have a wide range of masses , from @xmath4 10@xmath5 to less than 1@xmath6 .",
    "there is no characteristic or dominant mass for self - gravitating clouds : most star - forming regions are similar , except for size .",
    "it is size which determines the velocity dispersion of the cloud , as well as its density , for a common background pressure .",
    "n is the number of pixels in the azimuthal scan and k is the wavenumber .",
    "two dimensional power spectra of the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) emission of the milky way ( e.g. green , 1993 ; dickey et al .",
    "2001 ) are characterised by power laws , with slopes varying from -2.8 to -3 .",
    "elmegreen , kim and staveley - smith ( 2001 ) probed spatial scales in the large magellanic cloud , ranging over three orders of magnitude ( 30 - 4000pc ) , and found a 2d power law slope to be @xmath4 -2.7 ( or equivalently -1.7 in 1d ) .",
    "velocity and density spectra of the small magellanic cloud are presented by stanimirovic and lazarian ( 2001 ) ; the spectral indices ( for their 3d power spectra ) are -3.3 and -3.4 , equivalent to a 1d power law slope of -1.4 .    for classical kolmogorov turbulence ,",
    "the implication is that the gas is fractal in nature , with the turbulent kinetic energy cascading to ever smaller scales , according to @xmath10 .",
    "this derives from the assumption of a constant energy transfer at at scales .",
    "values steeper than -5/3 signify progressive energy losses , such as from compressible or shock dominated turbulence .",
    "if the scale height in the ambient medium is the typical scale for coherent star - forming structures , then self - gravity in the gas initiates the formation of star - forming clouds and star complexes ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "why use power spectra instead of conventional 2d fourier transforms ?",
    "for galaxies , the 2d fourier transform includes structure from the exponential disk , which is generally not wanted in analyses of interstellar clouds .",
    "power spectra generated from azimuthal profiles are , however , ideal , since in any given azimuthal swath , there will be no systematic radial gradients from the disk .",
    "elmegreen , elmegreen and leitner ( 2003 ) have studied some famous examples of nearby spirals ( such as ngc 3031=m81 ) , and have generated power spectra of the optical light in passbands such as b , v and r. their conclusion is that the optical light in spiral galaxies ( even grand - design ones such as m81 ) is the result of turbulence ; the implication therefore , is that young stars follow the gas as they form .",
    "they argue that large - scale turbulent motions may well be generated by sheared gravitational instabilities in the disk .",
    "salt will yield the much needed insight into the physical scale at which star formation in galaxies becomes coherent ; in our galaxy , we know this may range from several hundred parsecs , to a kpc ( gould s belt , of age @xmath4 30 myr , spans @xmath4 1 kpc ) .",
    "its optical imager , salticam , with its default bvri filters and 10@xmath1110 arcmin field of view , coupled with its high spatial resolution ( 15@xmath0 pixels , 106.7 @xmath0 arcsec@xmath12 , @xmath4 7 pixels per square second of arc ) , will be ideally placed for exploring kolmogorov turbulence beyond the magellanic clouds , down to the nyquist limit .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of bob stobie , whose vision and dream was salt .",
    "dlb is indebted to david buckley for his invitation to participate in this salt workshop .",
    "this research is supported by the anglo - american chairman s fund ; a note of deep appreciation is expressed to the board of trustees .",
