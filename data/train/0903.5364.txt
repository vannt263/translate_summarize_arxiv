    "the extensive study of disk accretion flows started in the 1960 s .",
    "the standard disk model , and then the slim disk model and the radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) model were proposed for explaining a variety of accretion modes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . these models are successful , but have some limitations .",
    "for example , the disk viscosity , the most important key ingredient for the accretion disk theory , is prescribed by a phenomenological @xmath0-viscosity model , whereby the viscous torque is proportional to the pressure @xcite , although its physical basis is not clear .",
    "they are ( radially ) one - dimensional models so that they can not describe multi - dimensional motion , such as outflow and internal circulation .",
    "complex coupling between radiation , magnetic fields , and matters is not accurately solved , either .",
    "since the disk viscosity is likely to be of magnetic origin @xcite , multi - dimensional global magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations are being rather extensively performed recently as a model for the disks with low luminosities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such non - radiative mhd simulations can not explain higher luminosity states , however , since strong matter - radiation coupling is expected . as an independent approach several groups performed two - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations of very luminous flow since the 1980",
    "s ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "those simulations were , however , non - mhd simulations and so they were obliged to rely on the phenomenological @xmath0-viscosity model .",
    "multi - dimensional radiation - mhd ( rmhd ) simulations are unavoidable .",
    "such simulations were attempted in the past ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , but these are restricted to local simulations performed under the shearing - box approximations and , hence , global coupling of magnetic fields was artificially quenched there .",
    "we , here , report for the first time the results of global two - dimensional rmhd simulations with a motivation to establish a unified view of the accretion flow and outflow around the black holes .",
    "our method of calculations is extension of that of mhd simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , where @xmath1 is the radial distance , @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle , and @xmath3 is the vertical distance .",
    "we assume that the flow is non - self - gravitating , reflection symmetric relative to equatorial plane , and axisymmetric with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "general relativistic effects are incorporated by the pseudo - newtonian potential @xcite . for the opacity , we consider the thomson scattering , free - free absorption , and bound - free absorption ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the energy equations of gas and radiation are given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the internal energy density of the gas , @xmath7 is the velocity , @xmath8 is the gas pressure ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the blackbody intensity , @xmath11 is the electric current , @xmath12 is the radiation energy density , @xmath13 is the radiative flux , @xmath14 is the radiation pressure tensor , @xmath15 is the absorption opacity .",
    "we adopt the anomalous resistivity , @xmath16 , which is the same as that used in @xcite ; @xmath17 ^ 2        & \\mbox{for } v_{\\rm crit}\\leq v_{\\rm d}<2v_{\\rm crit } \\\\",

    "\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the electron drift velocity , @xmath19 is the critical velocity , and @xmath20 is the maximum resistivity with @xmath21 being the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this form of the anomalous resistivity was proposed by @xcite to account for the occurrence of fast reconnections in solar flares .",
    "the mhd related terms are solved by the modified lax - wendroff scheme @xcite .",
    "we employ the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation to solve the radiation energy equation @xcite .",
    "the radiation energy transport via the radiative flux is solved based on the implicit method , where we separately treat radiative fluxes in the radial and vertical directions with using thomas method for a matrix inversion .",
    "the gas - radiation interaction is also solved with the implicit method , which is basically the same as that described by @xcite .",
    "an advection term in the energy equation of the radiation is solved with the explicit method , in which an integral formulation is used to generate a conservative differencing scheme .",
    "we performed the test of two - dimensional radiation propagation @xcite , finding that the energy loss is less than 0.005% in 600 steps , from which we estimate the error in the energy conservation not to exceed 0.08% during the photon traveling timescale in our simulations .",
    "the grid extends from @xmath22 to @xmath23 in the radial direction and from @xmath24 to @xmath25 in the vertical direction .",
    "the grid spacing is uniform , @xmath26 , in both directions .",
    "we adopt free boundary conditions for the matter and magnetic fields ; i.e. , the matter can freely go out but not to come in and the magnetic fileds do not change across the boundary .",
    "we assume that radiation goes out with the radiation flux of @xmath27 , except at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , through which no radiation goes out .",
    "we assume a black hole mass to be @xmath30 .",
    "in future we will perform simulations , in which we will put the boundary condition at around @xmath21 and to solve the both side of the midplane .",
    "we start calculations with a rotating torus , in which the magnetic fileds are purely poloidal ( plasma-@xmath31 ) and closed loops in the torus , being located at around @xmath32 embedded in non - rotating isothermal corona .",
    "our initial conditions are the same as those of model b in kato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , except that the density of the corona is 0.05 times as large as that one .",
    "we evolve the initial torus by solving non - radiative mhd equations for @xmath33 sec .",
    "we then assign the density normalization ( @xmath34 ) , density at the center of the initial torus , and turn on the radiation terms .",
    "we calculate three models in total , by setting @xmath35 ( model a ) , @xmath36 ( model b ) , and @xmath37 ( model c ) .",
    "since radiation loss rate depends on the density , we can reproduce the three distinct regimes of accretion flow .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] clearly visualizes that the flow patterns differ significantly among three models . the typical mass accretion rate ( @xmath38 ) , the luminosity ( @xmath39 ) , and the density ( @xmath40 ) and the temperature ( @xmath41 ) , as well as other important quantities , are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "the disk is optically and geometrically thick .",
    "photons are not easy to go out from the surface due to a large optical depth so that radiative cooling is restricted .",
    "we confirm the photon - trapping effects .",
    "the disk is supported by radiation pressure .",
    "circular motion appears in the disk region .",
    "since @xmath67 , this model corresponds to the two - dimensional version of the slim disk model .",
    "the calculated temperature and density are also consistent . in model b with a moderate density normalization , a geometrically thin disk forms because of efficient radiative cooling .",
    "the disk is optically thick and supported mainly by radiation pressure , which is slightly greater than the gas pressures .",
    "such properties , as well as the temperature and density , agree with those of the standard disk model . it might be noted well that the flow in model b has not reached a quasi - steady state , since the viscous timescale is about 45 sec at @xmath68 , whereas the elapsed time is 8 sec . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will present finer mesh calculations with adequate grid spacing , by which we will be able to investigate the detailed , internal structure of the thin disk .    in model c with a small density normalization ,",
    "the density is too low for radiative cooling to be important .",
    "the disk is filled with hot rarefied plasmas and is geometrically thick but optically thin .",
    "we find significant circular motion inside the disk .",
    "this model corresponds to the riaf model .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , the disk outflows with helical magnetic fields are ubiquitous around the black holes . in models",
    "a and c the magnetic field lines stretch out vertically in the vicinity of the rotation axis . while , around the equatorial plane , the toroidal component of the magnetic fields is dominant over other components in all models , which are reminiscent of magnetic - tower jets ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in model a , the strong radiation pressure force is responsible for driving the quasi - steady outflows above and below the disk , whose velocity amounts to @xmath69 .",
    "we find that the radiation energy density ( @xmath12 ) is very large in the disk region , and the steep profile of @xmath12 enhances the radiation force ( radiative flux ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably , our simulation of model b shows the occurrence of magnetically powered disk wind , on the contrary to the usual belief regarding the standard disk model .",
    "note , however , that the disk wind is not so strong in model b ; @xmath70 , and @xmath51 is the smallest among all models , where @xmath71 is kinetic luminosity .",
    "it must be stressed that we have solved the entire inflow - outflow structure simultaneously unlike the previous simulations , in which the inflow ( disk ) structure was not solved but treated as the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "our rmhd simulations reveal @xmath72 in model c in contrast with models a and b , implying that the disks with @xmath73 lose the energy via the jets rather than via radiation .",
    "the outflow rate is 10 % of the mass accretion rate , and the ratio is largest in three models .",
    "the photons freely escape from the disk , producing quasi - spherical distribution of @xmath12 , whereas the radiation energy is enhanced inside the disk in models a and b. the radiation force is negligible because of small radiative flux .",
    "the fld approximation is good for models a and c , since the whole region ( except for the very vicinity of the inner boundary ) is optically thick for thomson scattering in the former and radiative cooling is never important in the latter .",
    "it is known to be problematic to determine the direction of the radiation flux in regions where the optical depth is around unity ( e.g. , around the disk surface in model b ) .",
    "we , however , wish to stress that the outflow is accelerated by the magnetic pressure , and not by radiation force .",
    "we find that magnetic energy ( @xmath74 ) is amplified to be 30% and 20 % of the gas energy ( @xmath6 ) in models b and c , respectively ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . in model",
    "a , surprisingly , @xmath74 does exceed the gas energy , @xmath75 .",
    "its implication is enormous : the viscosity had better been scaled in terms of the total ( or radiation ) pressure and not of the gas pressure in radiation pressure - supported disks ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "( 80mm,90mm)pasj_fig2_3.eps    it is one of the most significant issues in astrophysics how to prescribe the disk viscosity . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show how the magnetic torque , @xmath76 , behaves as a function of the pressure in the region close to the black hole ( at @xmath77 ) .",
    "we can see that the torque is roughly proportional to the total pressure ( with some scatters ) in all the cases .",
    "if we define the viscosity parameter as @xmath78 where total pressure ( @xmath79 ) is the sum of gas pressure and radiation energy density divided by 3 , we estimate @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "cautions should be taken to the point that the properties of magnetic fields in the two - dimensional simulations could be affected by artificial occurrence of channel modes of flow and the anti - dynamo theorem and thus deviate from those of the three - dimensional simulations .",
    "hence , the three - dimensional study should be explored in future work .",
    "outflows and jets are ubiquitous in any regimes of black - hole disk accretion flow . they seem to manifest themselves by warm absorptions features of active galactic nuclei and by blue - shifted absorption lines in the black hole binaries ( bhbs ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the high - velocity outflows with velocity of @xmath69 in model a will explain the x - ray observations of bright quasars exhibiting blue - shifted absorption lines , which are interpreted as the absorption by the outflow material moving with velocity on the order of @xmath83 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although no strong outflows were expected in the framework of the standard disk model , @xcite concluded by x - ray observations of bhb , gro j1655 - 40 , that the x - ray absorbing wind is ejected from the geometrically thin disk viewed at an inclination angle of @xmath84 .",
    "the density and the velocity of the wind were reported to be @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "such features are roughly consistent with our simulation ( model b ) , in which the gas with @xmath87 is blown away towards the diagonal direction ( the polar angle of @xmath88 ) at the speed of @xmath89 .",
    "our simulations show that the magnetic field lines are along the jet axis ( models a and c ) . such structure is revealed by the recent radio observations of polarized emission in bl lac object , markarian 501 @xcite .",
    "the detailed comparison with the observations is left as future work . to summarize , our global rmhd simulations can open a new era of accretion disk research and provide a unified view of accretion flows in various contexts .    the computations were performed on a parallel computer at rikkyo university , xt4 system at cfca of naoj , super combined cluster system at riken , and the computational facilities including the t2k tsukuba and first cluster at ccs in university of tsukuba .",
