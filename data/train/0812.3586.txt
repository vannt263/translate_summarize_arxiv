    "the pairwise production of supersymmetric squarks and gluinos at the lhc leads to final states that contain two to four hard jets [ plus somewhat softer jets from qcd radiation and/or decays of heavier neutralinos and charginos ] and missing transverse momentum generated by two lsp s .",
    "these signatures are typical for n=1 supersymmetry @xcite as specified in the minimal supersymmetric standard model [ mssm ] . however ,",
    "in alternative realizations of supersymmetry the final - state topology could be rather different . in order to exemplify this point ,",
    "we have adopted an n=1/n=2 hybrid model , cf . ref .",
    "@xcite , in which supersymmetry characteristics are quite different from the mssm . assuming the n=2 mirror ( s)fermions to be very heavy in order to avoid chirality problems , the hybrid model expands to n=2 only in the gaugino sector .",

    "the ratio ( [ eq : ratio_af ] ) decreases monotonically as @xmath144 increases but by no more than 20% .",
    "most important is the ratio at the maximum of the @xmath119 cross sections where it is still close to the initial maximal value ; this can easily be explained by observing that , in feynman gauge , the leading contribution is generated by the quartic coupling .",
    "the differences in the color factors reflect the different strengths of the couplings in the fractional triplet @xmath146 and the integer octet @xmath47 couplings of su(3)@xmath14 with @xmath147 .",
    "the cross sections are shown in fig.@xmath27[fig : crosssections ] for @xmath148 tev across the invariant energy range relevant for the lhc .",
    "the values of the maxima in the @xmath119 and @xmath143 channels are about 1 pb and 0.2 pb , respectively , a typical size for such processes .",
    "0.5 cm    the cross section for @xmath0-pair production at lhc , @xmath149 , is shown by the solid red curve in fig.@xmath27[fig : lhcsigma ] for the @xmath0-mass range between 500 gev and 2 tev [ adopting the lo cteq6l parton densities @xcite ] .",
    "the cross section exceeds stop or sbottom - pair production ( red dashed line ) , mediated by a set of topologically equivalent feynman diagrams , by more than an order of magnitude , as anticipated at the parton level . with values from several picobarn downwards , a sizable @xmath126 event rate can be generated .    with the exception of",
    "@xmath150 decays , all the modes shown in fig.@xmath27[fig : br ] give rise to signatures that should be easily detectable if @xmath0 is not too heavy .",
    "the most spectacular signature results from @xmath151 decay , each @xmath0 decaying into at least four hard jets and two invisible neutralinos as lsp s .",
    "@xmath0-pair production then generates final states with a minimum of eight jets and four lsp s , as noted in the introduction .",
    "the transverse momenta of the hard jets produced in the simplest case @xmath152 can easily be estimated by analyzing production and decays near the mass thresholds , i.e. @xmath153 . in this kinematic configuration",
    "the total jet transverse energy and the average jet transverse energy amount to @xmath154 the total transverse energy @xmath155 carried by the lsps and the vector sum of the momenta of the four @xmath156 in the final state , which determines the measured missing transverse momentum @xmath157 , are predicted to be @xmath158 in the random - walk approximation for the @xmath159 momenta in the transverse plane .",
    "this is to be contrasted to gluino - pair production near threshold , where the corresponding observables are for the same mass configuration : @xmath160 thus , the total jet transverse energies and the missing transverse momenta are markedly different in the n=1 and n=2 theories for the same mass configurations .",
    "these simple estimates are backed up by a monte - carlo simulation of @xmath0-pair production at the lhc , followed by the decay into four on - shell gluinos .",
    "the total transverse jet energy and the vector sum of the lsp transverse momenta are summarized in tab.@xmath27[tbl : transspec ] for a spectrum of @xmath0-masses , and fixed ratios of gluino , squark and lsp neutralino masses .",
    "the squark and gluino masses are again chosen at about half a tev .",
    "the values of the transverse momenta match the earlier estimates quite well .",
    "it should be noted however that the jet transverse momenta fall into two groups .",
    "the transverse momenta of jets in gluino to squark decays are generally small while the transverse momenta of the jets generated in squark decays are large .",
    "both groups are populated equally so that the average transverse momenta of the jets are reduced by an approximate factor two compared with the mssm gluino pair production [ setting @xmath161 for the proper comparison ] .",

    "these channels also lead to four lsps in the final state , plus a large number of hard jets . on the other hand , the @xmath171 final state , which can be the dominant mode if the two - body decays into squarks and gluinos",
    "are kinematically excluded , might allow the direct kinematic reconstruction of @xmath109 .",
    "as noted earlier , sgluons can be generated singly in gluon - gluon collisions via squark loops .",

    "the resulting cross section for single @xmath0 production at the lhc is shown by the blue curves in fig.@xmath27[fig : lhcsigma ] [ based on the lo cteq6l parton densities @xcite ] .",
    "the solid curve has been calculated for the parameter set of the right frame of fig.@xmath27[fig : br ] , while the dashed curve has been determined by taking the soft breaking parameters in the gluino and squark sector from the widely used benchmark point sps1a@xmath174 @xcite . in the former case",
    "the single @xmath0 cross section can exceed the @xmath0-pair production cross section for @xmath175 tev . since sps1a@xmath174 has a somewhat smaller gluino mass [ which we again interpret as a dirac mass here ] it generally leads to smaller cross sections for single @xmath0 production .",
    "taking @xmath176 , as in the left frame of fig .  2 , would lead to a very small single @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "recall that @xmath177 is required if @xmath178 decays are to dominate . we thus conclude that one can not simultaneously have a large @xmath179 and a large @xmath180 .",
    "the signatures for single @xmath0 production , which is an @xmath181 process , are potentially exciting as well .",
    "however , since all final states resulting from @xmath0 decay can also be produced directly in tree - level @xmath182 processes at the lhc , it is a problem to be solved by experimental simulations whether single @xmath0 production is detectable as a resonance above the sm plus mssm backgrounds , given that in most cases , with the exception of the 2-gluon channel , the direct kinematic reconstruction of @xmath109 is not possible .",
    "the color - octet scalar sector in the n=1/n=2 hybrid model we have analyzed in this letter , leads to spectacular signatures of supersymmetry which are distinctly different from the usual mssm topologies .",
    "depending on the masses of the particles involved , either multi - jet final states with high sphericity and large missing transverse momentum are predicted , or four top quarks should be observed in @xmath183 production . if the mass splitting between @xmath3 and @xmath4 squarks is not too small , loop - induced single @xmath0 production may also have a sizable cross section ; however , this channel suffers from much larger backgrounds , though identifying the @xmath0 particle as a resonance in 2-gluon final states would truly be an exciting experimental observation .    in this letter we assumed that gluinos are pure dirac states , and that the two components of the complex scalar field , @xmath184 , are degenerate .",
    "relaxing these assumptions would introduce more parameters into the scheme , yet the central characteristics of the experimental event topologies of the final states at lhc would not change significantly .",
    "for example , for fixed mass , the @xmath87 or @xmath88 pair production cross section is simply half the @xmath0 pair production cross section .",
