    "<S> we calculate several differential distributions for exclusive double diffractive @xmath0 production in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron and in proton - proton collisions at rhic and lhc in terms of unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugdfs ) within the @xmath1-factorisation approach . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties of the khoze - martin - ryskin approach are discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 transition vertex is calculated as a function of gluon virtualities applying the standard pnrqcd technique . </S>",
    "<S> the off - shell effects are discussed and quantified . </S>",
    "<S> they lead to a reduction of the cross section by a factor 25 , depending on the position in the phase space and ugdfs . </S>",
    "<S> different models of ugdfs are used and the results are shown and discussed . the cross section for diffractive component depends strongly on ugdfs . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate also the differential distributions for the @xmath3 fusion mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated cross section for photon - photon fusion is much smaller than that of diffractive origin . </S>",
    "<S> the two components have very different dependence on momentum transfers @xmath4 in the nucleon lines as well as azimuthal - angle correlations between both outgoing nucleons . </S>"
