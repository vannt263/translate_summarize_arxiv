    "the heat capacity is one of the key physical quantities in materials research , since it can be directly measured and has a significant technological and scientific impact .",
    "it is crucial to determine the onset of phase transitions  @xcite and to construct thermodynamic data bases ( e.g. , using the calphad technique@xcite ) , to evaluate magnetocaloric effects  @xcite , as well as for applications in microelectronics  @xcite and modern battery materials  @xcite .",
    "computing the heat capacity and understanding its generic features requires an accurate determination of the temperature dependence of all relevant excitation mechanisms such as atomic vibrations , electronic excitations and the coupling between them .",
    "recent advances in finite - temperature first - principles calculations have led to an accurate description of key thermodynamic quantities of a broad range of material systems  @xcite .",
    "with the _ ab initio _ computed gibbs energy surface at hand , all measurable thermodynamic properties such as e.g. thermal expansion or temperature dependent elastic constants for a given compound can be accessed . out of this set",
    ", the heat capacity @xmath1 is particularly sensitive to fine details in the excitation mechanisms , since it is a second derivative of the gibbs free energy .",
    "special care is required at low temperatures  as demonstrated in the present work  where only the consideration of @xmath2 with @xmath3 allows a full evaluation of thermodynamic contributions to the heat capacity in non - magnetic metals@xcite and alloys .",
    "the debye model is commonly used to describe the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of materials at @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 : debye temperature ) . according to this model",
    "the heat capacity should exhibit a @xmath6 dependence .",
    "experimentally , however , in many metals deviations from the @xmath6 behaviour are observed at temperatures below 50 k. these deviations can be attributed to the realistic phonon dispersion as well as to electronic excitations close to the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "recent finite - temperature density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have indeed shown the importance of electronic contributions to the heat capacity for various metals  @xcite .",
    "in all these works , however , the focus was on the high temperature regime ( @xmath7 ) , where the importance of the electronic contributions also intuitively seems to be highest . while temperature effects well below @xmath5 are small on an absolute scale and have thus little effect on materials properties , analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the heat capacity towards absolute zero promises detailed insights into the various excitation mechanisms .",
    "the careful analysis of the low - temperature regime , both with respect to the methodological tools as well to the physical phenomena , is therefore in the focus of the present study .",
    "expressing calorimetric data solely as a sum of a vibrational phonon contribution ( cubic in @xmath8 ) and an electronic contribution ( linear in @xmath8 )  @xcite neglects couplings between these excitation mechanisms .",
    "the interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom yields adiabatic as well as non - adiabatic corrections . the impact of electronic temperature on the interatomic forces and thus on phonon energies is typically added to the adabiatic part .",
    "the term `` electron - phonon coupling '' is ( in the context of perturbation theory ) reserved for transition probabilities between electronic states due to ionic displacements @xcite .",
    "it is described within the eliashberg theory by a coupling strength , which rescales the electronic heat capacity by a mass enhancement parameter@xcite .",
    "it is directly related to the phonon linewidth arising from interactions with electrons@xcite .",
    "while electron - phonon coupling is an established concept in the field of superconductivity , it is rarely discussed in calorimetry . only few studies used this contribution to explain observed deviations in heat capacity measurements of simple metals when using only the two adiabatic contributions .",
    "in contrast to the present study the focus in these works was on temperatures well above the debye temperature @xcite . though it is mathematically clear that the linear ( i.e. electronic ) term will dominate over the cubic ( i.e. vibrational ) term at sufficiently low temperatures , a detailed analysis how well dft captures this competition and the coupling of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom at very low temperatures is currently missing . such a benchmark is in particular important for alloys , for which low temperature experimental data are typically not readily available , making finite - temperature dft calculations a promising tool for an accurate assessment of physical properties .    in the present work , we investigate the aforementioned deviations from the debye behaviour in the low temperature regime within a full _ ab initio _ approach and perform experiments as a benchmark .",
    "we take pure al and the intermetallic compound al@xmath0sc as prototypical systems .",
    "the al@xmath0sc precipitate phase is of prime importance to achieve the high mechanical strength of al rich al - sc alloys and has , over the last couple of decades , enabled the impressive development of these alloys  @xcite . besides possessing a structural ( fcc crystal structure ) and dimensional ( lattice mismatch approx .",

    "to derive the thermodynamic properties of a given material system within dft , the helmholtz free energy is a common starting point . for a defect free non - magnetic material ,",
    "the free energy includes the following contributions , @xmath9 where the electronic ( el ) , quasiharmonic ( qh ) and the anharmonic phonon - phonon coupling ( ph - ph ) constitute the adiabatic approximation  @xcite , while the electron - phonon coupling ( el - ph ) contains also non - adiabatic contributions .",

    "we use a representation of the bz by 64 exact @xmath56 points ( corresponding to lattice modulations fitting into a @xmath46 supercell ) for this purpose , in order to achieve a well - defined weighting of the bz . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( dashed orange curve ) , the procedure suppresses the maximum in @xmath59 for al at t @xmath47 40 k and creates a new relatively flat maximum at a slightly higher temperature .",
    "flat modes in the phonon dispersion curve at higher frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath110 ) are responsible for the remaining maximum .    to see how the addition of sc affects the non - debye behaviour , we compare the phonon dispersions of pure al with al@xmath0sc ( fig .  [ dos_and_phonon]c ) : the phonon branches in al@xmath0sc are higher in frequency than in al .",
    "this is attributed to the stiffer nature of the al - sc bonds as compared to al - al bonds due to a strong hybridization between sc @xmath111 and al @xmath112 electron states@xcite and also reflected by a higher bulk modulus value of 85.2 gpa for al@xmath0sc in contrast to 74.6 gpa for al .",
    "in addition , we observe a different relevance of flat optical branches in particular above 6 thz , yielding the peaks @xmath110 and @xmath113 in the vdos of al@xmath0sc ( fig .",
    "[ dos_and_phonon]d ) . to check the impact of these peaks onto the maxima in the heat capacity of al@xmath0sc",
    ", we repeated the procedure of neglecting the frequency band of 4 - 6 thz ( which lead to @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( dashed green curve ) , we again observe a significant reduction in the maximum with a shift towards higher temperature as was also observed in the case of al .",
    "hence , the peak @xmath110 is less relevant than @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "plot ( right y - axis ) for al and al@xmath0sc .",
    "the solid orange and green curves correspond to @xmath114 considering all the frequency modes in the phonon dispersion .",
    "the fading gray curves are the einstein @xmath114 calculated at frequency @xmath44 corresponding to the peaks @xmath115 and @xmath113 in the vdos of al@xmath0sc ( fig .",
    "[ dos_and_phonon]d ) respectively .",
    "the dashed grey curve joins the maxima ( grey circles ) of the einstein @xmath114 curves .",
    "note that theory is given as @xmath114 , whereas experimental data are given as @xmath59 , resulting in an insignificant difference . ]    to evaluate the importance of these peaks in the vdos , we use the einstein model in which each phonon branch is effectively replaced by a constant single frequency @xmath116 and the vdos exhibits a single discrete peak .",
    "the einstein heat capacity is given by  @xcite , @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the number of atoms , the boltzmann and the planck constant , respectively .",
    "the critical temperature at which the heat capacity has a local maximum as per the einstein model is @xmath119 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( fading gray curves ) , we plot the einstein @xmath114 curves for the frequencies corresponding to @xmath115 and @xmath113 of al@xmath0sc ( fig .",
    "[ dos_and_phonon]d ) . with increasing frequency ( @xmath120 ) ,",
    "the maximum is observed to flatten and to shift towards higher temperatures .",
    "this trend agrees with our foregoing comparison of maxima for al and al@xmath0sc : the peaks in the al@xmath0sc vdos are at higher frequencies ( owing to stiffer phonons ) than those for al .",
    "consequently , the maximum is flatter and observed at a slightly higher temperature than al . therefore , the non - debye behaviour of crystals is mainly determined by the low - lying flat regions in the phonon spectrum , i.e. the region of 4 - 6 thz in al and al@xmath0sc is responsible for the maxima around 40 - 50 k in the heat capacity . comparing the heat capacities of al and al@xmath0sc ( figs .",
    "[ sfig : cp_by_t3_al ] and [ sfig : cp_by_t3_al3sc ] ) , one can notice that the maximum is less pronounced for al@xmath0sc and occurs at higher temperature .",
    "based on the insights gained in this study , we demonstrate : ( i ) the predictive capability of finite - temperature dft in accurately describing the competition between electronic and vibrational heat capacity contributions in al and al@xmath0sc at temperatures well below the debye temperature , if highly converged calculations are performed .",
    "( ii ) the importance of contributions beyond the adiabatic approximation , in particular of electron - phonon coupling for the correct determination of the electronic heat capacity at low temperatures . (",
    "iii ) the connection of flat branches in the phonon spectrum and the observed maxima in the low - temperature heat capacity measurements that are not captured by the debye model .",
    "the availability of highly accurate dft computed heat capacities including the partition in the various entropic contributions allowed a detailed analysis about the validity of approximate but commonly applied physical models such as sommerfeld theory or debye model . to visualize and discuss the relevant low temperature features we considered various renormalized transformations .",
    "the comparison of al and al@xmath0sc reveals that the observed deviations from the debye behaviour at low temperatures are particularly strong in the pure element al .",
    "the addition of 25 at.% sc to al reduces the fcc symmetry due to the l1@xmath82 superstructure . despite the higher structural complexity , however , the low - temperature features in the heat capacity become less pronounced .",
    "this is related to the higher stiffness of the al - sc bonds and the resulting increase of the debye temperature . in an al - sc alloy that phase separates into a solid solution and al@xmath0sc",
    "precipitates , the thermodynamic properties at low temperatures will therefore be determined by the al - rich matrix . while this study focussed on two example systems ",
    "fcc al and al@xmath0sc  all discussions and considerations regarding the methodological approaches and the analysis of the data are general and can be directly transferred to other materials and compounds .",
