    "in theory , gravitational lenses can be used to address astrophysical problems such as the cosmological model , the structure and evolution of galaxies , and the structure of quasar accretion disks ( see the reviews by kochanek  ( @xcite ) of strong lensing and wambsganss ( @xcite ) of microlensing ) .",
    "one of the main challenges in using lenses for any of these applications is discovering large numbers of lenses efficiently ( see the review of lens surveys in kochanek  ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "most known lenses have been found either from optical imaging surveys of known quasars ( see pindor et al .",
    "@xcite for a recent study ) , radio imaging surveys of flat - spectrum radio sources ( see browne et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or searches for anomalous , higher redshift emission lines in galaxy spectra ( see bolton et al .",
    "imaging surveys of all radio sources ( burke  @xcite ) proved difficult because of the confusing array of structures observed for steep spectrum radio sources .",
    "haarsma et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed improving the efficiency of searches for lensed steep - spectrum sources by looking for radio lobes with optical counterparts , but the approach is limited by the resolution and sensitivity of existing all - sky radio surveys .",
    "none of these methods is easily applied to the next generation of large scale imaging surveys such as the sdss supernova survey ( sako et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the dark energy survey ( des , abbott et al .",
    "@xcite ) , pan - starrs ( kaiser  @xcite ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , tyson et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is to use a combination of color and morphology to identify quasar lens candidates ( morgan et al .",
    "this strategy can be effective as long as emission ( or absorption ) by the lens galaxy does not significantly change the color of the system from that of the quasars , which restricts its applicability to systems in which the quasar images are significantly brighter than the lens galaxy .",
    "a new feature of all these projects , however , is that they are synoptic surveys which obtain light curves for variable sources .",
    "pindor ( @xcite ) suggested that the synoptic data could be used to find lenses by cross - correlating the light curves of closely separated sources to search for the time delays present in the lensed systems .",
    "this approach may be problematic as a search method because it requires the automated extraction of light curves for the individual lensed images , some of which may also be distorted by the effects of microlensing .",
    "however , it will be an essential component of verifying lens candidates in the synoptic surveys .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a far simpler strategy . unlike almost any other source",
    ", lensed quasars are `` extended '' variable sources because the variable flux is spread out over the scale of the image separations . as we discuss in  2 , restricting the search to extended variable sources",
    "is an extraordinarily powerful means of eliminating sources other than gravitational lenses . in ",
    "3 we demonstrate the method using data we have been acquiring to measure time delays and microlensing variability in known lensed quasars ( kochanek et al .",
    "we summarize our proposed search in  4 .",
    "the basic problem in lens searches is that they are intrinsically rare objects .",
    "we start with the problem that quasars are relatively rare .",
    "[ fig : starcount ] shows the surface density of quasars ( @xmath1 ) computed from the g - band 2slaq quasar luminosity functions ( richards et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for these models , the surface density at 23",
    "mag is approximately @xmath2  deg@xmath3 .",
    "lensed quasars are rarer still , since a conservative estimate for the lensing probability of these faint quasars is @xmath4 ( see the review of lens statistics in kochanek  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , while the number of faint , lensed quasars is almost two orders of magnitude greater than the number of lenses presently known , it is not a trivial problem to find the one lensed quasar in each 5  deg@xmath5 region given the @xmath6 other sources in the same area .",
    "the problem is further complicated by the increasing importance of the contribution of the lens galaxy flux to the total flux of the lens as we search for fainter lensed sources .",
    "the lens galaxy masks both the color and morphology of the lensed images , making traditional quasar selection methods useless .",
    "the key to our approach is to apply difference imaging ( alard & lupton  @xcite , alard  @xcite ) to the synoptic data from large imaging surveys .",
    "some version of difference imaging will be used in all these surveys as the basis for identifying variable sources and extracting light curves .",
    "difference imaging works by scaling , in both flux and psf substructure , a reference image to match the data obtained for each epoch and then subtracting the two to form a series of difference images @xmath7 .",
    "the difference image has flux only for objects that have varied between the reference image and the epoch under consideration , so it has the immediate advantage of eliminating all the galaxies .",
    "we focus on time variability because quasars are intrinsically variable sources . on two year",
    "time scales , roughly 50% of quasars vary by more than 0.1  mag ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "@xcite ) with general correlations that fainter quasars observed at bluer wavelengths show greater variability ( vanden berk et al .",
    ". the variability of lensed quasars will be still greater than that of unlensed quasars because they are also microlensed by the stars in the lens galaxy ( see wambsganss  @xcite ) .",
    "we will conservatively assume that fraction @xmath8 of detected quasars will show 10% flux variations during the course of the survey .",
    "we can divide variable sources into three general categories : variable point sources ( stars , quasars , supernovae and other explosive events ) , moving solar system objects ( asteroids , kuiper belt objects ) , and gravitational lenses .",
    "let us consider what these three classes of objects look like in an image of the variable flux formed by computing the absolute value or root - mean - square ( rms ) of the differenced images for a field .",
    "the point sources are variable but do not move , so they will appear as point sources .",
    "solar system objects move rapidly across the field , appearing as a sparsely realized `` track . ''",
    "small separation gravitationally lensed quasars appear as extended , non - circular objects , while wider separation lensed quasars appear as very closely separated groupings of variable objects",
    ". we will refer to them as examples of `` extended '' variable objects .",
    "while resolved four - image lenses are virtually impossible to mimic with any other source , two - image lenses can be mimicked by several other sources .",
    "the least interesting backgrounds are variable star pairs or variable star / quasar pairs which occur simply because of chance superpositions .",
    "two astrophysically interesting backgrounds are binary quasars , whose abundance on separations @xmath9 is comparable to that of gravitational lenses ( see hennawi et al  @xcite ) , and lensed supernovae . very crudely ,",
    "if there is one detectable supernovae per @xmath10  mag galaxy per century , then the abundance of lensed supernovae is comparable to that of lensed quasars .",
    "both binary quasars and lensed supernovae can be easily distinguished from lensed quasars based on their light curves .",
    "this can be done rapidly for the case of supernovae , but may take @xmath11years for the case of a binary quasar .",
    "we focus on comparing the surface density of lenses to the surface density of variable star pairs , since they represent the least interesting background .",
    "star pairs that can be resolved in normal seeing are separated by large physical distances and should show no significant correlations in their activity .",
    "this makes it straight forward to estimate the background of uninteresting extended variable sources .",
    "while in general the fraction of stars that are variable will vary greatly depending on the stellar population observed , for a  normal \" stellar mix about 1 - 2% of stars vary by more than 1% ( e.g. hartman et al .",
    "moreover , studies of variable quasars located behind the smc showed that their main stellar contaminant in the color - variability space are massive be stars , which will be rare away from the galactic plane ( dobrzycki et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since we will be interested in regions well away from the galactic plane and the significantly higher long term variability amplitudes of quasars",
    ", we will assume that fraction @xmath12 of stars will have variability comparable to that of quasars .",
    "thus , if there are @xmath13  deg@xmath3 stars with v@xmath10  mag at high galactic latitude ( bahcall & soneira  @xcite ) the surface density of variable stars is @xmath14  deg@xmath3 .",
    "the surface density of ( uncorrelated ) pairs of variable stars separated by @xmath15 should be of order @xmath16 for a surface density 1/300  deg@xmath5 at v@xmath10 with @xmath17 that is well below that of gravitational lenses .",
    "[ fig : starcount ] shows the expected surface density of stars , variable stars and variable stars pairs ( @xmath17 ) as a function of galactic latitude ( at @xmath18 ) and v - band magnitude in the bahcall & soneira  ( @xcite ) star count models .",
    "the surface density of star pairs with @xmath17 is comparable to the surface density of variable stars .",
    "variable star pairs and variable star / quasar pairs are comparable in abundance , with the former being being more common for v@xmath19  mag and the latter more common at fainter magnitudes . comparing the surface density of variable star pairs and lensed quasars , we see that samples of extended variable objects should be dominated by gravitational lenses rather than chance superpositions .",
    "in order to demonstrate our idea , we analyzed our monitoring data for four lenses using the isis difference imaging package ( alard  @xcite ) .",
    "each epoch consisted of a 15  min r - band exposure ( taken as three 5  min exposures ) with the smarts 1.3 m telescope using andicam ( depoy et al .",
    "we analyzed only the images with seeing fwhm @xmath20 , sky backgrounds @xmath21  adu / pixel , and flux calibrations relative to the reference image @xmath22 ( to eliminate data taken through clouds ) .",
    "the four lenses we considered were qj  01584325 ( morgan et al .",
    "@xcite ) , sdss  0924 + 0219 ( inada et al .",
    "@xcite ) rxj  11311231 ( sluse et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and q  2237 + 0305 ( huchra et al .",
    "rxj11311231 consists of a bright cusp triple spanning 23 separated by 32 from a much fainter fourth image .",
    "sdss  0924 + 0219 is a more compact four - image lens .",
    "it has an einstein ring diameter of 17 and the flux is dominated by the brightest image .",
    "qj  01584325 is a still more compact two - image lens with an image separation of @xmath23 . in our monitoring program",
    "we only include lenses with image separations greater than @xmath24 , so we can not provide examples with smaller separations .",
    "this is not a significant bias since the median separation of gravitational lenses is approximately @xmath25 ( e.g. browne et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the surveys should have better resolution than our smarts data .. we do , however , include q2237 + 0305 , a four image lens with a 18 einstein ring diameter buried in the bulge of a very bright ( b@xmath26  mag ) low redshift spiral galaxy .",
    "we used 71 , 37 , 57 and 26 epochs of data for qj  01584325 , rxj  11311231 , sdss  0924 + 0219 , and q  2237 + 0305 , respectively .    for each lens we computed the average of the images @xmath27 , its estimated noise @xmath28 , and the rms of the difference images @xmath29 .",
    "in computing @xmath30 , we rejected the two epochs with maximum values of @xmath31 for each pixel in order to remove satellite trails and low level cosmic ray events which had not been found by earlier processing procedures .",
    "the overall signal - to - noise ratio in the combined images is very high , with a point source sensitivity of roughly r@xmath32  mag .",
    "we compute the significance of the variability using the ratio @xmath33 between the variance image and the noise in the average image , a ratio which should be unity in the absence of variability or systematic errors . in practice ,",
    "our rms images @xmath30 are limited by systematics beyond the point ( roughly 10 images ) that the statistical errors approach 1% of the sky level .",
    "the limitation is presumably due to systematic problems associated with flat fielding , interpolation , and the difference imaging algorithms",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ fig : lenses1 ] and [ fig : lenses2 ] show our four examples , comparing the average image @xmath34 to a map of the significance of the variability , @xmath33 .",
    "the first point to note is the complete vanishing of everything in the field other than the lens .",
    "the second point to note is that all four lenses are easily recognized as multi - component / extended sources without any need for further processing .",
    "the appearance of the four - image lenses ( sdss  0924 + 021 , rxj  11311231 and q  2237 + 0305 ) is particularly striking . to be fair ,",
    "this is true for all these lenses but q  2237 + 0305 in the direct images as well .",
    "on the other hand , emission from the lens galaxy masks a steadily increasing fraction of lensed quasars fainter than 20  mag , so q  2237 + 0305 is more `` typical '' of the faint quasar lenses that will comprise the majority of the systems detectable in the deep synoptic surveys than the other three systems .    in the full 30  arcmin@xmath5 fields ,",
    "there were no other variable sources .",
    "thus , to provide a comparison to the behaviour of the lenses , we applied the same procedures to the field of the microlensing event ogle-2005-smc-001 using 62 5  min i - band observations obtained with andicam by the microfun collaboration ( r. pogge , private communication ) .",
    "[ fig : smc ] shows the average and variability images for a region with the same size as was used in figs .",
    "[ fig : lenses1 ] and [ fig : lenses2 ] . in this case , the field contains four strongly variable sources , the microlensing event and three long period variable ( lpv ) stars .",
    "all four variable sources are obviously stellar in the variability map and would not be flagged as lens candidates even though they are all blended with other sources in the direct image .",
    "almost all new , large scale imaging surveys will be synoptic surveys that monitor the time variability of sources in the survey area . by using difference imaging to search for extended variable sources , these surveys can easily identify lensed quasars because almost all other variable sources are either point sources or orbital tracks created by solar system objects .",
    "we estimate that gravitational lenses are the most common extended variable sources for galactic latitudes @xmath35 , with modest contamination from pairs of variable stars , variable star / quasar pairs and binary quasars .",
    "limiting the search to extended variable sources reduces the number of non - lens background objects by more than @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it should be relatively straight forward for sdss , pan - starrs , des or lsst to identify the lensed quasars in their respective variability survey areas . for lsst",
    ", this should amount to roughly @xmath37 lensed quasars to v@xmath10  mag .",
    "note that the criterion of being an extended variable source can be combined with other criteria to further reduce the rate of false positives based on other information available from the same survey .",
    "for example , the quasars will have slowly varying aperiodic light curves , while many stars will show more rapid variability or periodic variability . where the source is resolved",
    ", the light curves of lensed quasars should be similar and can be cross - correlated to measure a time delay and verify that the source is a lens .",
    "note , however , that our discovery method depends only on the existence of variability rather than the measureability of the delay .",
    "the colors of stars and quasars are different at most redshifts ( e.g. richards et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the colors of lensed images should be similar , up to concerns about differential extinction in the lens ( e.g. falco et al .",
    "finally , in the average image it should be possible to detect a lens galaxy , potentially using difference imaging methods to accurately subtract the quasar contribution .",
    "in general , the background of non - lens sources can be so greatly suppressed that we suspect the only significant issue for candidate selection will be systematic errors in identifying extended variable sources that are presently difficult to quantify .",
