    "is provided by hard rescattering in a theory with dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "after advent of qcd , pion and nucleon form factors were calculated within the hard scenario @xcite , and it was realized that perturbative qcd predicts , in fact , the @xmath18 asymptotic behavior . in the pion case ,",
    "the prediction is @xmath19 , where @xmath20gev@xmath4 is a constant close to @xmath21gev@xmath4 .",

    "also , the smallness of @xmath24 undermines attempts to describe available data solely by pqcd hard mechanism . during the last years",
    ", the growing consensus is that at available @xmath0 , form factors are dominated by soft contributions described by nonforward parton densities @xmath25 @xcite ( or generalized parton distributions @xmath26 for zero skewness @xmath27 ) , and successful fits were obtained @xcite in models with @xmath28 having exponential behavior for large @xmath0 at fixed @xmath29 .",

    "another new development is related to applications of ads / cft construction to qcd and claims @xcite that this framework ( often referred as `` ads / qcd '' ) provides a nonperturbative explanation of quark counting rules . in this scenario",

    "this is one of the goals of the present investigation .",
    "another is to study the recently proposed interpretation @xcite of ads / qcd results in terms of light - front wave functions , which opens a possibility to find out whether , in terms of the light - cone momenta @xmath42 , the ads / qcd quark counting corresponds to large-@xmath43 hard mechanism or , as we will show , to the @xmath31 soft feynman / drell - yan @xcite mechanism . in view of yet another recent observation @xcite that some of the results of the ads / qcd approach coincide with those of migdal s program @xcite ( that starts with a perturbative correlator and substitutes its cuts by hadron poles ) , we apply the extension @xcite of this `` meromorphization '' idea to the 3-current correlators , and",

    "@xcite , and observed that , despite its @xmath2 asymptotic behavior , the combination @xmath46 is not flat in the accessible region @xmath48 gev@xmath4 .",
    "we also found that the asymptotic @xmath2 result is governed by the feynman mechanism rather than by large transverse momentum dynamics .",
    "we discussed the meromorphization approach , in which the form factors are given by integrating the perturbative spectral density @xmath185 with weights proportional to @xmath303 , and showed that , if one uses scalar currents made of scalar quarks , the result coincides with the expression given in ref . @xcite .",
    "for spin-1/2 quarks , we studied a particular tensor projection of the 3-point function , and demonstrated that , due to an extra @xmath304 factor , the resulting form factor @xmath5 has @xmath6 asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , owing to the late onset of this asymptotic pattern , the combination @xmath305 is rather flat in the phenomenologically important few gev@xmath4 region , i.e. , @xmath5 imitates the @xmath2 behavior .",
    "then we presented the results for the pion form factor obtained in the local quark - hadron duality model , which corresponds to integrating the perturbative spectral density @xmath185 with @xmath306 weights .",
    "again , the lowest - order term has nominally the @xmath6 asymptotics , but it imitates the @xmath2 behavior in the few gev@xmath4 region . including the @xmath7 correction term of @xmath185 brings in the hard pqcd contribution having the dimensional counting @xmath2 behavior at large @xmath0 .",
    "however , at accessible @xmath0 , the @xmath7 term is a rather small fraction of the total result , because of small @xmath307 factor associated with each higher order correction .",
    "we did not discuss the nucleons form factors in the present paper , but we want to mention that the lowest - order perturbative density for spin-1/2 quarks is known @xcite , and since the double borel representation ( see eq.([phipert2 ] ) ) in that case has @xmath308 factor , the resulting asymptotic behavior of @xmath185 is @xmath227 .",
    "but the local duality result for @xmath309 closely follows the dipole shape of the data up to @xmath310 gev@xmath4 .",
    "thus , we observe that the power of @xmath304 in these perturbative versions of the relevant parton densities @xmath35 increases with the number of quarks like @xmath311 , i.e. , the probability that the total momentum of @xmath312 spectators is @xmath313 goes like @xmath314 , which looks quite natural . due to feynman mechanism , this formally gives @xmath315 behavior for form factors . however , because of the late onset of the asymptotic regime , the form factors imitate @xmath36 behavior in a rather wide preasymptotic region . in this scenario ,",
    "the `` observed '' quark counting rules is an approximate and transitional phenomenon dominated by nonperturbative , long - distance aspects of hadron dynamics .",
