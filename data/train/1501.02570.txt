    "it is interesting to check if similar results can be obtained from laboratory experimental data where the access to very small initial separation is limited by both physical and statistical constraints .",

    "the turbulent flow , with @xmath152 for our data set , is generated by eight propellers at the tanks corners and particles are tracked in space and time using four ccd cameras .",
    "the cameras are focused on a small volume of @xmath153 to resolve the smallest scales ( the kolmogorov scale is @xmath154 ) . at such small scales ,",
    "the flow is expected to be isotropic .",
    "we study pairs of particles with initial separations of a few @xmath155 , for which numerical and previous experimental studies of turbulent flows found an approximately linear flow @xcite .",
    "as isotropy and a linear dependence of velocity differences on separation are the two assumptions entering the prediction of the conservation of @xmath156 , the experimental set up described above appears to be appropriate to test it .",
    "unfortunately , a direct check of these assumptions does not seem to support their applicability .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] we present @xmath160 , using the relative velocity of particles with separation @xmath11 . here and in the following @xmath161 denotes an average over pairs in an ensemble with a given initial separation to prevent contamination of the time evolution by a change of the particle ensemble ] .",
    "when it is applied to functions of the relative velocity or acceleration at a given scale it denotes the average over the pairs with the corresponding initial separation , taken at @xmath13 . as can be seen from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , if any scaling regime , @xmath162 , is to be assigned , it would be with scaling exponent @xmath163 rather than @xmath164 .",
    "it seems that in order to access the linear flow regime in this system even smaller distances should be probed , which is not experimentally accessible at the moment .    for separations at the transition between inertial and dissipative ranges , as those apparently probed in this experiment ,",
    "there is currently no theoretical prediction regarding the existence of a conservation law .",
    "still , in the spirit of the conservation law in the dissipative range , we can look for @xmath105 such that @xmath165 . notice that as a function of @xmath105 , @xmath166 is convex and at each time @xmath7 it crosses @xmath167 at @xmath168 and either has one more crossing point , denoted by @xmath169 , or none .",
    "it would be possible to establish the existence of a conservation law , with @xmath170 , if @xmath171 exists and is time independent .",
    "to get an idea of what value @xmath171 can take we use the taylor expansion of @xmath45 around @xmath13 ( no assumption is made about the nature of the flow ) :      with @xmath173 where @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 is the relative acceleration .",
    "this implies that the conservation law described above can exist only if @xmath177 is time independent , so that @xmath178 .",
    "this is of course only a necessary but not a sufficient condition .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath179 comes from the first order in the taylor expansion @xmath180 .",
    "it , as well as @xmath181 , should be zero for a statistically homogeneous or a statistically isotropic flow .",
    "obviously in an experiment @xmath182 can never be exactly zero , but it can be small enough so that at the shortest times measured the time dependent term in @xmath179 would be negligible compared to the time independent part , @xmath183 in ( [ nstar ] ) .      in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] we present @xmath182 normalised by the rms relative velocity .",
    "the strong bias towards positive @xmath182 for @xmath184 is probably the result of the filtration of pairs with life times smaller than @xmath185 .",
    "indeed , pairs with approaching particles at small separations are harder to track and are therefore frequently short lived as well as more prone to errors",
    ". a similar problem might also be the cause of the positive bias for @xmath186 , where particles with a large relative velocity are more common .",
    "then , particles approaching each other with a large speed reach small scales quickly and are lost more easily .",
    "when the restriction on the life time of the pairs is lifted a negative bias emerges .",
    "it therefore appears that using @xmath182 for pairs of particles to determine the isotropy or homogeneity of the flow is problematic . for our purposes , note that for an observation of the conservation of @xmath187 to be possible the value of @xmath182 must be as small as possible .",
    "initial separations @xmath188 seem most appropriate .    for a d - dimensional incompressible flow that is statistically isotropic a simpler formula for @xmath179 can be written .",
    "for such a flow ( see also @xcite ) @xmath189 which can be used to write @xmath190 implying that in ( [ nstar ] ) @xmath191 as a side note , we remark that if @xmath192 is constant , like in the inertial range , the initially slowest changing function , @xmath193 , is independent of @xmath11 @xcite . more generally , requiring only @xmath194 , the @xmath11 independent slowest varying ( among twice differentiable functions of @xmath39 ) function @xmath195 , is determined by demanding @xmath196 , resulting in @xmath197 dx.\\ ] ] with @xmath198 an arbitrary separation and @xmath199 . for a 3-dimensional isotropic flow",
    "this formula reduces with the help of ( [ iso ] ) to @xmath200 here , however , we focus on the simpler functions @xmath201 , which , through @xmath179 , are @xmath11 dependent .",

    "[ fig:11 ] where we present both the lhs of this equation and its rhs as a function of initial separation .",
    "the difference between the two is about @xmath202 for most separations , implying that isotropy is violated .",
    "it could also be that the flow is , in fact , isotropic : although in theory measuring relative velocities for pairs of particles at a given distance is the same as using two fixed probes in the flow , in practice it might not be so ( for example due to correlations entering through the method of pair selection ) .    , deduced by matching @xmath203 , plotted as a function of @xmath11 at different times .",

    "note that @xmath183 has a non - negligible contribution coming from the deviation of @xmath181 from zero .",
    "this contribution is displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] .",
    "we are now in a position to ask if for the separation where initially @xmath208 , @xmath209 is just a slowly varying function or a true conservation law . in fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] , for the separation @xmath206 , we compare @xmath210 as a function of time for different @xmath105s , including @xmath211 .",

    "<S> we show that , as an extension of the conservation law , a evans - cohen - morriss / gallavotti - cohen type fluctuation relation exists . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse data from a 3d laboratory experiment [ liberzon et al . , physica d 241 , 208 ( 2012 ) ] , finding that although it probes small scales they are not in the smooth regime . </S>",
    "<S> thus instead of @xmath2 , we look for a similar , power - law - in - separation conservation law . we show that the existence of an initially slowly varying function of this form can be predicted but that it does not turn into a conservation law . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the conservation of @xmath3 , demonstrated here , can be used as a check of isotropy , incompressibility and flow dimensionality in numerical and laboratory experiments that focus on small scales .      </S>",
    "<S> the word turbulence is often used as a synonym for turmoil and disorder . </S>",
    "<S> inherently , particles in a turbulent flow perform an irregular , complicated motion </S>",
    "<S> . it could therefore come as a surprise that a quantity depending on the separation between such particles could remain constant during their movement . </S>",
    "<S> of course , due to the chaotic nature of the flow , one can expect only a statistical conservation of this type , recovered after averaging over velocity realizations . </S>",
    "<S> the subject of the present paper is the verification , on the basis of both numerical and experimental data of lagrangian tracers , of the conservation law first predicted in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> lagrangian conservation laws in turbulence have been studied previously and have provided much insight into the breaking of scale invariance in such flows ( see @xcite for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , analytical expressions for them could be derived only for short correlated velocity fields ( i.e the kraichnan model ) , and although they were deduced ( numerically ) and observed in a navier - stokes turbulent flow , @xcite , they were asymptotic laws , holding only when the initial separation between particles is forgotten .    in @xcite @xmath4 was introduced as an all time conservation law for a @xmath5 dimensional flow , where @xmath6 is the time @xmath7 magnitude of the relative separation between a pair of particles starting at a fixed distance @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation is expected for an isotropic flow and for separations where the velocity difference @xmath9 scales linearly with the distance : @xmath10 , which we will refer to here as a linear flow . </S>",
    "<S> previously it was believed that it is only an asymptotic in time conservation law and thus would be difficult to observe @xcite ( see also @xcite for a historic review ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result in @xcite opens up the possibility to observe it and subsequently use it as a check of isotropy and/or incompressibility , as well as flow dimensionality , in experiments probing very small scales . </S>",
    "<S> physically relevant situations for these observations are phenomena occuring around or below the kolmogorov scale , such as , for example , tracer dynamics in cloud physics and lagrangian statistics in the direct cascade of two - dimensional turbulence .    </S>",
    "<S> the invariance of @xmath4 under the time evolution can be traced back to a geometrical property of an incompressible linear flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for such a flow , for each velocity realization , the volume of an infinitesimal d - dimensional hyper - spherical sector , with radius @xmath11 and differential solid angle @xmath12 , at @xmath13 , is equal to its transformation under the flow at time @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath14 note that it is due to the linearity of the transformation that a spherical sector is transformed to another spherical sector . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation law directly follows : for a pair of particles in the flow , starting with the separation vector @xmath8 @xmath15 with @xmath16 the volume of the @xmath17-dimensional unit sphere and @xmath12 parametrizing the direction of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the first equality is a consequence of the assumption that the flow is statistically isotropic , the average over velocity realizations for a scalar quantity thus being independent of the direction of @xmath8 . in the second equality the average and the integration </S>",
    "<S> are interchanged and equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is used .    </S>",
    "<S> recasting the conservation law in the form @xmath18 with @xmath19 brings to mind the jarzynski equality @xcite , in which @xmath20 is related to entropy production in an out of equilibrium system . </S>",
    "<S> this hints at the possible presence of a evans - cohen - morriss @xcite or gallavotti - cohen @xcite type fluctuation relation . </S>",
    "<S> below we demonstrate that such an extension of the conservation law is indeed possible for symplectic flows . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> since a ( linearised ) two dimensional incompressible flow is already symplectic , the existence of a fluctuation relation is guaranteed and no further assumption , such as time reversibility , is required . </S>",
    "<S> resemblance to the jarzynski equality also provides a different perspective on the latter- it can be thought of as a statistical conservation law .    in the following we provide a direct confirmation of conservation of @xmath4 in an isotropic fully developed turbulent flow . </S>",
    "<S> we first present the results from a direct numerical simulation of a 2d flow , with large scale forcing and friction . for scales much smaller than the forcing , in the direct cascade , the flow is linear and the theory applies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that as long as the separation between particles remains in this regime , @xmath21 remains constant as well . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find the symmetry relation @xmath22 with @xmath23 as a generalization of the conservation of @xmath21 . at long times </S>",
    "<S> this yields a gallavotti - cohen type fluctuation relation as discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider data from a direct numerical simulation of @xmath24-dimensional turbulence and study particles with initial separations in the dissipative range , where approximately @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the conservation of @xmath26 ending in a regime where @xmath26 no longer converges . at those times the separations distribution at small scales </S>",
    "<S> is induced by the dynamics in the inertial range rather than the dissipative range of scales .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we turn to data of @xmath27 turbulence from a laboratory experiment . </S>",
    "<S> initial particle separations are taken at scales comparable with the kolmogorv scale of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in distinction from the numerical simulation , the scaling of the velocity is far from the approximation @xmath25 for such separations . </S>",
    "<S> also , deviations from an isotropic flow are observed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we check instead if an analogue of @xmath2 , in the form of a power law , exists for the scales available in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a slowly varying function of this form can be predicted using the statistics of the pairs relative velocity and acceleration at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not appear to be a true conservation law . </S>"
