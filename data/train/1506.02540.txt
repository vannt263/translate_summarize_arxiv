    "the mathematical theory for the spread of infectious diseases has a long history and is by now quite rich ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the more common type of disease models is called sir ( susceptible @xmath1 infective @xmath1 recovered ) meaning that individuals are at first susceptible . if infected ( by someone )",
    "they immediately become infectious ( being able to spread the disease onwards ) . after some time an infectious individual recovers , which also means that the individual is immune to further infection from the disease .",
    "such models were originally studied for populations assuming homogeneous mixing , but during the last few decades considerable effort has been put into analysing epidemic models in communities which are not homogeneously mixing but instead may be described using some type of social structure , such as a community of households ( e.g.  @xcite ) or a random network describing possible contacts ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the vast majority of papers devoted to these type of problems assume a fixed community and community structure . in the current paper",
    "we treat the situation where the population is dynamic in the sense that people die and new individuals are born , or more precisely immigrate into the population .",
    "further , we assume that there is also importation of infectious individuals ( randomly in time according to a homogeneous poisson process ) , implying that the disease never vanishes forever . in order to facilitate analytical progress",
    "we consider only the case of a homogeneously mixing community , which in network terminology corresponds to treating the complete network .",
    "models for recurrent epidemics go back to the deterministic formulations of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a stochastic treatment was given first in the pioneering work of  @xcite , who considered an sir model with importation of both susceptibles and infectives , but without disease - unrelated deaths .",
    "an alternative model , with disease - unrelated deaths but no importation of infectives , has been studied extensively ( e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "interest often centres on the time to extinction of infection and the closely - related problem of the critical community size for an infection to persist in a population .",
    "we consider a markovian sir epidemic with demography and importation of infectives , in which infectious individuals infect new individuals at constant rate and the infectious period is exponentially distributed .",
    "we study limit properties of the epidemic when the average population size @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "our focus lies on the case where the limit is taken keeping the basic reproduction number @xmath3 ( i.e.  the average number of susceptibles infected by a single infective in an otherwise fully susceptible population of size @xmath0 ) and the immigration rate of infectives fixed , whereas the quotient of the average infectious period and the average lifetime tends to 0 faster than @xmath4 . for many infectious diseases this quotient typically lies between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , hence supporting this asymptotic regime , but in the discussion we treat other asymptotic regimes briefly .    under the above asymptotic regime , all epidemic outbreaks are short , having duration that tends to @xmath10 in probability as @xmath11",
    "further , as @xmath11 , epidemic outbreaks are either minor , having size of order @xmath12 , or major , having size of exact order @xmath13 .",
    "it follows that , as @xmath11 , the behaviour of the three - dimensional process describing the evolution of the fraction of the population that are susceptible , infective and recovered , is encapsulated in a one - dimensional regenerative process @xmath6 , describing the limiting fraction of the population that are susceptible . during each cycle , the process @xmath7 makes one down jump , corresponding to the occurrence of a major outbreak , and except for this increases deterministically , as minor outbreaks have no effect on @xmath14 in the limit as @xmath11 .",
    "( here , @xmath15 , where , for @xmath16 , @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the number of susceptible individuals in the population at time @xmath19 . )",
    "note that @xmath14 does not converge weakly to @xmath7 in the skorohod topology since the sample paths of @xmath7 are almost surely discontinuous but those of @xmath14 almost surely contain only jumps of size @xmath20 , so are close to being continuous .",
    "thus to obtain rigorous convergence results , we consider two processes , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which coincide with @xmath14 , except during major outbreaks during which they sandwich @xmath14 , and prove that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 converge weakly to @xmath7 in the skorohod topology ( theorem  [ wconv ] ) .",
    "it then follows that certain functionals of @xmath14 converge weakly to corresponding functionals of @xmath7 ( corollary  [ convfunct ] ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ modelmain ] , we define the model and the limiting regenerative process , give an intuitive explanation of why @xmath7 approximates @xmath14 for large @xmath0 and present the main convergence results . in section  [ s - properties ] , we derive some properties of the limiting regenerative process : the jump size distribution , the associated renewal time distribution and the stationary distribution . in section  [ illustrations ] , we present simulations supporting the convergence result and illustrating various features of the limiting process . in section  [ proofs ] , we prove the main results .",
    "we end in section  [ disc ] with a discussion summarising our results and also exploring briefly additional questions , such as other asymptotic regimes .",
    "we now define the markovian sir epidemic with demography and importation of infectives ( sir - d - i ) .",
    "we consider the process to be indexed by a target population size @xmath0 , which we assume is a strictly positive constant .",
    "the population model is an immigration - death process with constant immigration rate and linear death rate . for @xmath16 ,",
    "let @xmath23 denote the population size at time @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath23 increases at constant rate @xmath24 and decreases at rate @xmath25 .",
    "the population size hence fluctuates around @xmath0 , which is assumed to be large .",
    "the markovian sir - epidemic on this population is defined as follows . for @xmath16 ,",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the number of susceptibles , infectives and recovered , respectively , at time @xmath19 , so @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 and that @xmath30 as @xmath11 , where @xmath31 $ ] is constant .",
    "( the value of @xmath32 has no effect on the ensuing epidemic . ) .",
    "a fraction @xmath33 of all births ( i.e.  immigrants ) are infectives and the remaining births are all susceptibles , so births of infectives occur at rate @xmath34 and births of susceptibles occur at rate @xmath35 . while infectious , any given infective infects any given susceptible at rate @xmath36 , independently between each distinct pair of individuals .",
    "thus , approximately , each infective makes infectious contacts at the points of a homogeneous poisson process having rate @xmath37 , with contacts being with individuals chosen independently and uniformly from the whole population ; a contact with a susceptible individual results in that individual becoming infected , while a contact with an infectious or removed individual has no effect .",
    "each infectious individual recovers and becomes immune at rate @xmath38 , implying that the infectious period is exponentially distributed with rate parameter @xmath38 .",
    "more formally , the process @xmath39 is a continuous - time markov chain , with state space @xmath40 and transition intensities given by @xmath41 corresponding to birth of a susceptible , birth of an infective , death of a susceptible , death of an infective , death of a recovered , infection of a susceptible and recovery of an infective , respectively .",
    "we study specifically the case where the average population size @xmath0 tends to infinity in such a way that    * the total importation rate @xmath34 of infectives tends to a strictly positive constant @xmath42 , so @xmath43 as @xmath2 ; and * the infection and recovery rates satisfy @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath2 .    for ease of exposition , we assume that @xmath0 is an integer , so sequences of epidemic processes are indexed by the natural numbers . however , all of the results of the paper are easily generalised to the case of a family of epidemic processes indexed by the positive real numbers .    to conclude , the parameters of the model are : @xmath0 , the average population size ; @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the average lifetime and @xmath24 is the population birth rate ; @xmath37 , the infection rate ; @xmath38 , where @xmath48 is the average length of the infectious period ; and @xmath33 , the fraction of births which are infectious , so @xmath34 is the birth ( or importation ) rate of infectives .",
    "let @xmath49 , where @xmath17 is the  fraction \" of the population that is susceptible at time @xmath19 .",
    "the process @xmath6 can be viewed as the limit of @xmath14 as @xmath11 under the above asymptotic regime .",
    "it is a markovian regenerative process ( e.g.  @xcite , chapter v ) , with renewals occurring whenever @xmath50 . between each renewal @xmath51 increases",
    "deterministically according to the differential equation @xmath52 except for one down jump ( from above @xmath53 to below @xmath53 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath54 before the jump ( if @xmath55 denotes the time from the last renewal ) .",
    "the random time @xmath56 from a renewal to the jump has distribution specified by @xmath57\\quad(t \\ge 0),\\ ] ] with @xmath58 given by  , so @xmath59 the size of the jump is specified by the value @xmath60 of the process just prior to the jump .",
    "more precisely , @xmath61 , where for @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the unique strictly positive solution to the equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite , equation ( 3.15 ) ) @xmath64 in epidemic theory @xmath63 is known as the relative fraction infected among the initially susceptible of an sir epidemic outbreak in which a fraction @xmath65 are initially susceptible and the rest immune .",
    "hence , the size of the down jump is @xmath66 .",
    "after the down jump , @xmath51 increases deterministically according to the same differential equation   until the next renewal point , so @xmath67\\ ] ] and the inter - renewal time is @xmath68 $ ]",
    ". illustrations of @xmath7 are given in section  [ illustrations ] .",
    "we first explain heuristically why @xmath7 can be viewed as the limit of @xmath14 as @xmath11 under that asymptotic regime described in section  [ model ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is large .",
    "then when no infective is present , all that happens is that individuals die and new ones are born at approximately the same rate @xmath24 .",
    "recovered ( immune ) individuals that die are replaced by susceptible individuals , so the fraction of susceptibles increases at rate @xmath69 which explains the deterministic growth rate of @xmath7 .",
    "after an exponentially distributed holding time , with rate parameter @xmath70 , an infective is born into the community .",
    "if the fraction susceptible @xmath71 is below @xmath53 , then the effective reproduction number @xmath72 is strictly less than one , implying that , with probability tending to one as @xmath11 , a large outbreak will not occur , so @xmath71 continues to grow approximately deterministically . if @xmath73 when a new born infective enters the community , then with approximate probability @xmath74 that infective gives rise to a major outbreak that infects order @xmath75 susceptibles ( cf .",
    "@xcite , pages 53 and 376 ) , otherwise only a minor outbreak , which infects order @xmath76 susceptibles , occurs and @xmath71 continues to grow approximately deterministically .",
    "this explains the distribution for @xmath56 , the time from a renewal until a down jump in @xmath7 , which has time varying intensity given by @xmath42 multiplied by the limiting major outbreak probability ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if a major outbreak takes place , the size of the outbreak among the susceptibles is given approximately by @xmath77 where @xmath60 denotes the limiting ( as @xmath78 ) fraction susceptible just prior to the outbreak and @xmath79 is defined above ( cf .",
    "@xcite , page 60 ) .",
    "the duration of such a major outbreak is of order @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which tends to @xmath10 by assumption .",
    "thus , if there is a major outbreak it happens momentarily and , in the limit as @xmath11 , the fraction susceptible after the outbreak , @xmath81 , satisfies @xmath82 .",
    "although the above heuristic argument makes it plausible that the normalised susceptible process @xmath83 converges to the regenerative process @xmath7 , there are two complicating factors in making the argument fully rigorous .",
    "first , as explained in section  [ sec_intro ] , it is not true that @xmath84 as @xmath5 , where @xmath85 denotes weak convergence in the space @xmath86 of right - continuous functions @xmath87 having limits from the left ( i.e.  cdlg functions ) , endowed with the skorohod metric ( e.g.  @xcite , chapter 3 ) .",
    "as explained also in section  [ sec_intro ] , we overcome this problem by considering two processes , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which coincide with @xmath14 except during major outbreaks , when they sandwich @xmath14 , and show that @xmath88 and @xmath89 as @xmath11 ; see theorem  [ wconv ] .",
    "the second complicating factor is that the results referred to above concerning the probability , size and duration of a major outbreak are for an epidemic in a static population , whereas our population is dynamic .",
    "the results carry over to our setting because , in the limit as @xmath11 , the time scale of an epidemic outbreak is infinitely faster than that of demographic change , but proofs need to be adapted accordingly .    before stating our main theorem , some more notation is required .",
    "recall that @xmath90 is the number of infectives at time @xmath19 in the sir - d - i epidemic with average population size @xmath0 and that we consider epidemics with no infective at time @xmath10 , i.e.  with @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath92 , let @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , provided @xmath0 is sufficiently large , the @xmath95th major outbreak starts at approximately time @xmath96 and ends at time @xmath97 .",
    "( the choice of @xmath98 to delineate major outbreaks is essentially arbitrary .",

    "in the paper it is proved that for an sir epidemic in a dynamic population ( whose size fluctuates around @xmath0 ) , in which there is importation of infectives at a constant rate , the normalised process of susceptibles converges to a regenerative process @xmath7 as @xmath2 .",

    "the asymptotic regime considered is for the situation when the rate of importation of infectives @xmath612 and the basic reproduction number @xmath3 remain constant with @xmath0 , whereas the average length of the infectious period @xmath48 converges to 0 faster than @xmath4 ( in most real - life epidemics , the ratio of average infectious period and average lifetime lies between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .    other asymptotic regimes could of course also be considered .",
    "for example , if the importation rate of infectives grows with @xmath0 , then there will always be infectives present in the population resembling an endemic situation .",
    "if the duration of an infectious period remains fixed ( or at least grows slower than @xmath98 ) , then the duration of a single outbreak will be long and the typical time horizon will not go beyond the first outbreak .",
    "a more complicated and interesting scenario seems to be for the asymptotic situation treated in the current paper , but where the epidemic is initiated with a fraction @xmath53 of the population susceptible and a large enough number of infectives .",
    "it then seems as if an endemic equilibrium will stabilize , but determining and proving this rigorously remains an open problem . for large but finite @xmath0 , it is possible for the process to get stuck in an endemic situation near the end of a major outbreak ( with states similar to those just described ) .",
