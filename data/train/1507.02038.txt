    "the purpose of this paper is to derive an irreversible kinetic equation through the fundamental laws of physics described by the liouville - von neumann equation without relying upon phenomenological arguments .",
    "the example we discuss in this paper is a weakly - coupled one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum perfect lorentz gas .",
    "the world surrounding us is irreversible , and there is an arrow of time oriented toward our future that breaks time - symmetry",
    ". nevertheless , the fundamental equations of motion in microscopic level are time - symmetric . to resolve this apparent contradiction is a long - standing problem in dynamics and statistical mechanics .",
    "a traditional assertion found in many textbooks in statistical mechanics is that the irreversibility is not a fundamental dynamical property , and it comes from our approximation of smearing out of detailed microscopic information that can not be controlled due to our limitations as human beings ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this anthropocentric view to explain the irreversibility is called _ coarse - graining_. however , after we found the dissipative structure that allows our existence , this anthropocentric view is incomprehensible , since we are not fathers of the arrow of time , but we are children of the arrow of time @xcite .    with ilya prigogine , one of the authors ( tp ) in this paper has formulated the irreversible dynamics through the fundamental laws of physics without relying upon such anthropocentric phenomenological arguments @xcite . in this formulation",
    "we consider the spectral representation of the liouville - von neumann operator ( liouvillian ) for systems in which irreversibility is expected such as the case of the thermodynamic limit where intensive variables and extensive variables exist .",
    "this formalism is an extension of the well - known brillouin - wigner - feshbach formalism of the eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian in quantum systems to the eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian . in this formulation , we start with a complete set of projection operators ( often we choose a complete set of projection operators consisting of the eigenstates of the unperturbed liouvillian ) . then , for each subspace associated to a projection operator we construct an _ effective liouvillian _ that shares eigenvalues with the original liouvillian , similarly to the case for the effective hamiltonian in the hamiltonian dynamics",
    ".    corresponding to the self - energy part of the effective hamiltonian , we have _ self - frequency part _ of the effective liouvillian . by the same reason in the effective hamiltonian , the effective liouvillian may become a non - hermitian operator for unstable systems with resonance singularity , in spite of the fact that the liouvillian itself is a hermitian operator indicating the time - symmetric nature of the fundamental laws of physics . as a result , an eigenvalue of the liouvillian becomes a complex number which is located at a resonance pole of the resolvent operator ( or , the green s function ) of the liouvillian in the complex frequency space .",
    "associated to a complex eigenvalue , we have a resonance state for the liouvillian as in the hamiltonian case . for the hamiltonian case ,",
    "the imaginary part of a complex eigenvalue gives a decay rate of an unstable excited state .",
    "similarly , the imaginary part of a complex eigenvalue of the liouvillian gives a transport coefficient associated to an irreversible process .",
    "it is important to recognize that the existence of the resonance pole of the resolvent operator of the hamiltonian is a direct consequence of the mathematical structure of the hamiltonian , and does not result from an anthropocentric operation , such as the coarse - graining .",
    "in other words , the decay rate that breaks time - symmetry in the hamiltonian system is an intrinsic dynamical property of the system . for exactly the same reason , irreversibility associated with transport coefficients in the liouvillian system",
    "is an intrinsic dynamical property of the liouvillian dynamics derived from the microscopic fundamental laws in physics .    in spite of the parallelism between the hamiltonian case and the liouvillian case",
    ", there is a fundamental difference between them in the self - energy or self - frequency part in the effective operators mentioned above . indeed , even in the case where the unperturbed hamiltonian does not degenerate , the unperturbed liouvillian has intrinsic degeneracy . for quantum case",
    "this is a result of the fact that the liouvillian is defined by the commutation relation with the hamiltonian ( see ( [ def : liouville ] ) ) . as a result ,",
    "even in the case the self - energy part of the hamiltonian is just a number , the self - frequency part becomes an operator . in statistical mechanics this self - frequency part operator has been called the _ collision operator _ , and it is a central object in non - equilibrium statistical physics .    even though main framework of our formalism mentioned above of the irreversible processes is settled on the microscopic laws of the fundamental dynamics , its application to actual systems is generally extremely complex , because the infinitely many degrees of freedom are mutually interacting in systems that show irreversibility .",
    "moreover , the kinetic equation derived from the eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian has a nonlinear structure that comes from two different origins ; ( i ) one is due to the appearance of the product of the one - body distribution function due to the many - body effect , and ( ii ) the other is due to the fact that the collision operator itself depends on its eigenvalue . due to these complexity , we have applied this formulation so far only to the case where drastic approximations to solve the complex eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian is applicable , such as the cases , for example , near equilibrium state where a linearized approximation with respect to the product of the distribution function is applicable , or the spatial inhomogeneity has a macroscopic scale at least of the order of the mean - free - length @xcite .",
    "since one can not analyze the dynamics in a microscopic scale much smaller than the mean - free - length by this drastic approximation , we have not yet been able to demonstrate the advantage of our microscopic approach over the phenomenological coarse - graining approach .",
    "the main purpose of this paper ( and successive forthcoming papers ) is to analyze microscopic origin of irreversibility that is applicable to all spatial scale of the inhomogeneity including microscopic scale of the interaction range for the weekly - coupled 1d quantum perfect lorentz gas where the mass of a light test particle is negligible as compared with mass of heavy particle .",
    "the advantage of the lorentz gas is a mathematical simplicity .",
    "thanks to the disparity in number of degrees of freedom between a light test particle and background many heavy particles , one can neglect the time evolution on the distribution function of the heavy particles in the thermodynamic limit . as a result , the complexity of the nonlinearity associated to the origin ( i ) mentioned above does not exist in the lorentz gas .",
    "we especially focus our attention in this paper on limitations of the usual phenomenological boltzmann approximation . through our microscopic approach based on the complex spectral representation of the liouvillian ,",
    "the meaning of the coarse - graining will become clearer .",
    "in addition , we report our discovery on an interesting shifting motion in space that is generated by the boltzmann collision operator , especially for the distribution function localized in moderately small spatial scale less than the mean - free - length , but yet with a large enough width as compared with the microscopic scale given by the interaction range .",
    "we found that there are two completely different mechanisms of the shifting motion in space ; one is due to the asymmetry of the momentum distribution and predominates in a moderately small wavenumber associated to the inhomogeneity , while the other is due to the wave propagation associated to the real part in the eigenvalue that appears only in a moderately large wavenumber .",
    "as we shall see , this shifting motion can not be described in the hydrodynamic approximation ( such as the diffusion equation ) that is applicable only to situations with extremely larger spatial scale as compared with the mean - free - length .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows : in sec.ii , we introduce the 1d quantum perfect lorentz gas . in sec.iii , we summarize general formalism of the complex spectral representation of the liouvillian and apply it to the model . in sec.iv , we discuss limitations of the boltzmann approximation . in sec.v",
