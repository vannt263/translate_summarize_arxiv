    "the last few years witnessed an explosion of studies in population imbalanced ( ` polarized ' ) fermi gases , partly fueled by the mit and rice experiments with resonantly interacting ultracold @xmath0li atoms @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations of these and following experiments @xcite is to search for the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state , a spatially modulated superfluid @xcite .",
    "so far , no evidence of fflo was found in three dimensional ( 3d ) traps .",
    "this is in agreement with the mean field theory prediction that fflo state only occurs in a tiny region in the phase diagram of 3d polarized fermi gas @xcite .",
    "contrary to 3d , in one dimension ( 1d ) , bethe ansatz @xcite and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies @xcite show that a fflo - like phase ( which only has algebraic order ) occupies a rather large region in the phase diagram of polarized attractive fermi gas .",
    "taking these results together , recently parish _ et al _ @xcite proposed that the most promising regime to realize fflo state is in quasi - one dimension , i.e. , a 2d lattice array of cold atomic `` tubes '' @xcite where the transverse tunneling @xmath1 is weak .",
    "they obtained the phase diagram of the quasi-1d system using mean field theory @xcite .",
    "these works prompted the experimental search for the fflo phase in quasi-1d atomic gas systems .",

    ", one has to first answer a related question : 2 ) what is the low energy effective description for the 1d fflo phase ?",
    "an effective theory can yield analytical expressions for the zero and finite temperature correlation functions and serve as a starting point to analyze the instability of 1d fflo against @xmath1 .",
    "note that a field theory for 1d fflo state was previously proposed by yang to describe 1d superconductors in magnetic field @xcite . in yang s model , spin and charge degrees of freedom",
    "are assumed decoupled .",
    "however , we shall show that this model does not apply to attractive fermi gases with",
    "_ finite _ spin imbalance ( ` magnetization ' ) because the assumption of spin - charge separation breaks down @xcite .    in this paper , we answer these open questions using a combination of several well established theoretical techniques .",
    "we first develop an effective field theory for the 1d fflo state , which properly treats the spin - charge mixing in trapped two component atomic gases and fully takes into account the intratube quantum fluctuations .",
    "then we treat the transverse tunneling perturbatively @xcite to obtain the phase diagram of a 2d lattice array of weakly coupled 1d fermi gases , which is an anisotropic 3d system .",
    "we also derive the scaling formula for the transition temperature of the quasi-1d fflo state .",
    "our approach , based on exact solutions , is complementary to the mean field method of ref @xcite , which applies to the opposite limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "taken together , they can provide a more complete understanding of the dimensional crossover of quasi-1d attractive fermi gases with finite population imbalance , and provide guidance for the experimental search of the quasi-1d fflo phase .",

    "@xmath66 has been investigated thoroughly by many authors since the pioneer works of ref . .",

    "this is drastically different from typical situations in solids where the zeeman energy is much smaller than the fermi energy . in general , the spin - charge mixing terms have to be treated on the same footing as other terms in @xmath54 .",
    "while a direct perturbative analysis of @xmath74 is possible , it is unclear how well the bosonized hamiltonian @xmath54 describes the system for the case of strong interaction and large population imbalance .",
    "for these reasons , we shall adopt an alternative but much more powerful method , which is valid for arbitrary @xmath75 and treats the spin - charge mixing effect exactly , to construct the bosonized effective field theory of @xmath30 .",
    "the method is based on the bethe ansatz solution of the microscopic model @xmath30 ( or @xmath76 ) and general principles of conformal field theory .",
    "in this section , we show that despite the spin - charge mixing , the 1d fflo phase features a more general decoupling of two critical degrees of freedom . in the language of conformal field theory , the 1d fflo state is a critical phase with two gapless normal modes and it is formally described by the direct product of two virasoro algebras with central charge @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "such a  two fluid \" description is in accordance to our physical intuition in higher dimensions , e.g. , the 3d attractive fermi gas with population imbalance in the strong interaction ( bec ) limit can be described by a fermion - boson mixture with some residue interactions . however , the distinction between bosons and fermions is lost in 1d .",
