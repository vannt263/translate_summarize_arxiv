    "absorption line systems detected in the spectra of quasi stellar objects ( qso ) originate in intervening galaxies or protogalaxies . among the different classes of absorbers , the damped lyman @xmath0 systems ( dla ) are those characterized by n(hi )",
    "@xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3 and by showing many low ionization species such as feii , siii , crii , znii and oi , which are in their dominant ionization stage for a hi region .",
    "the high accuracy in the hydrogen column density determination derived from the damped wings and the absence of significant ionization corrections allow accurate absolute abundance determinations of the gas phase elements . since dla systems are observable up to the highest redshift they provide a unique tool for the study of the cosmic chemical history of the early universe .",
    "such observations are complementary to the hubble deep field ones ( mobasher et al . 1996 ) which show that high redshift galaxies have a large variety of morphological types including many peculiar objects with traces of interaction and merging : interestingly , a large fraction are starburst galaxies , as suggested by their colors .",
    "the relative elemental abundances rather than absolute ones are a valuable diagnostic of the first elemental buildup .",
    "this is because absolute abundances are affected by all the model assumptions , whereas abundance ratios generally depend only on the assumed nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes .",
    "the way of using the information contained in abundance ratios is to compare the observed ratios with predictions from chemical evolution models which take into account detailed stellar nucleosynthesis and lifetimes . as in the milky way",
    ", we hope to distinguish halo - like abundances , produced by type ii sne and characterized by enhancements of @xmath0 elements with respect to the iron - peak elements , from disk - like abundances , produced by the cumulative effect of both type ia and type ii sne , where the abundance ratios become progressively solar .",
    "the halo abundance pattern follows from the fact that fe arises mostly from type ia supernovae with some contribution from type ii , while the reverse is true for si and o. the longer lifetimes of the snia , which are believed to have progenitors with masses of 1 - 8 m@xmath4 , result in a delayed iron enrichment compared to the major snii products such as @xmath0-elements ( tinsley , 1980 ; greggio and renzini , 1983a ; matteucci and greggio , 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios is mainly dependent on the relative lifetimes of type ia and ii supernovae .",
    "another key element is nitrogen and the ratio n / o . this element , in fact , is thought to originate mainly from low and intermediate mass stars and to be a `` secondary '' element , in the sense that it is produced proportionally to the initial stellar metallicity . as a consequence nitrogen is restored into the interstellar medium with a large temporal delay relative to oxygen , which is produced in massive stars and",
    "is a `` primary '' element , namely its production is independent of the initial stellar metallicity .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath0/fe and n / o ratios can be used as cosmic clocks and represent a clue in understanding the nature of high redshift objects such as qso ( hamman and ferland , 1993 ; matteucci and padovani , 1993 ) and dla systems ( matteucci , 1995 ) .",
    "the dla systems are generally believed to be the progenitors of the present - day spiral galaxies ( wolfe et al .",
    "however , it has also been suggested that they could be dwarf galaxies , since they have a large amount of gas , low metallicities and low dust - to - gas ratios ( pettini et al . 1990;meyer and york 1992 ; steidel 1994 ) .",
    "whether dla are proto - spirals or proto - dwarfs can be indicated by their observed abundance pattern . to this purpose in this paper",
    "we will present models of chemical evolution for galaxies of different morphological type and compare them with the observed abundances in dla .",
    "so far chemical abundances have been measured in a set of dla systems and with a variety of resolutions and accuracies by black et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , meyer & york ( 1987 ) , chaffee et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , meyer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , meyer & roth ( 1990 ) , rauch et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , pettini et al .",

    "( 1995 ) , lu et al ( 1995b ) . here",
    ", we would like to focus on the abundances which could be used to compare with chemical evolution models and in particular with the few nitrogen detections so far reported in the literature .",
    "a summary of the abundances for the systems for which nitrogen detection or upper limits are available are reported in table 1 and 2 .",
    "all the original abundances have been renormalized to the solar abundances of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , with the exception of @xmath5=@xmath6 taken from hannaford et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ( [ m / h ] @xmath7 log(m / h)-log(m / h)@xmath8 ) .",
    "the abundances in the tables are derived from column density ratios of different atomic and ionic species in the gas phase , and can be translated to elemental abundances only if ionization effects and dust depletion are negligible or can be accounted for . in the following",
    "we discuss shortly these two effects .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath9 values taken from lipman ( 1995 ) .",
    "the n / o versus o / h distribution is shown in fig . 1 where the models with only one burst together with the models for the solar neighbourhood are shown .",
    "the dot - dashed curve is from model n. 5 from kunth et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( model 3 of table 3 ) and it can reproduce the observations of izw 18 . incidentally , we note that this model can fit very well the n / o upper limit by pettini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) but for a burst age shorter than 20 myr .",
    "on the other hand , pettini s et al.s point , as well as the other points from lipman ( 1995 ) , could be marginally reproduced also by the evolution of a disk galaxy in the earliest phases of its evolution ; in particular during the halo phase , as it is shown in the figure .",
    "in fact , the continuous curves in fig .",
    "1 represent the predictions from the model of chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood under different assumptions about the nucleosynthesis of n. in particular , the area delimited by those models goes from purely secondary n in stars of all masses ( the straight line at the right end ) to primary n in massive stars and secondary and primary n in low and intermediate mass stars . on the other hand , the n / o ratios observed by molaro et al.(1995 ) and green et al.(1995 ) are reproduced by models with a strong starburst and very strong galactic wind ( models 4 and 5 in table 2 ) , so that models for the solar neighbourhood seem to be completely ruled out in explaining these two dla systems .",
    "thus we show that it is possible to have large n / o ratios even at low o abundances if the nitrogen produced by massive stars , restored on relatively short time scales , is primary and with a strong differential effect in the galactic wind . as shown in fig .",
    "2 the same model produces solar ratios of alpha - elements ( such as s , o and si ) to iron peak elements ( such as fe and zn ) , as it is observed at least in few dla . in particular , in fig",
    "2 we show the predictions of the models for o and si relative to iron to be compared with the data of table 4 . the x - axis does not extend to abundances larger than [ fe / h]=-2.0 since in one - burst models the metallicity does not increase any further . sulphur is not shown here but it should closely follow oxygen . on the other hand , the predicted [ si / fe ] is lower than [ o / fe ] and the reason for this resides in the fact that more si than o is produced in type ia sne ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ; thielemann et al .",
    "1993 ) and that we assume the same @xmath10 parameter for si and o. studies of abundances in halo stars do not allow us to discriminate clearly on this point ( franois , 1986 ; ryan et al . 1991 ; primas et al . 1994 ; mcwilliam et al . 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , it does not seem safe to assume [ si / o]=0 in order to derive oxygen abundances in dla systems ( see lipman , 1995 )",
    ". however , as indicated in figure 2 the observed [ o / fe ] is lower than [ si / fe ] for the dla observed by molaro et al .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that , in the framework of the differential galactic wind , o , which originates mostly in type ii sne , should be lost from the galaxy in a larger percentage than silicon , which originates also from type ia sne . in other words ,",
    "si should be treated as we do with c and fe .",
    "however , numerical experiments show that even in this case is difficult to invert the situation and have [ si / fe ] higher than [ o / fe ] , as indicated by the data taken at face values !    in figure 3",
    "we show the predicted n / o vs. o / h from models with 4 short bursts ( 20 myr each ) all occurring inside the first gyr from the start of star formation , so that they can be representative of high redshift objects . in particular , we show the predictions of model 6 and 7 which are similar to model 3 and 2 , respectively , but with four bursts of star formation.these models show that in principle the dla systems from green et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and from molaro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) could be explained by a galaxy like izw18 experiencing more than one burst of star formation and observed during the interburst period , without invoking an extremely large wind parameter .",
    "in fact , during this phase the n / o ratio increases as due to the fact that oxygen is no more produced while n continues to be restored from low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "this is a well known effect as shown by pilyugin ( 1992;1993 ) .    in figs .",
    "4 and 5 we show the [ o , si / fe ] ratios predicted by model 6 and 7 , respectively . here too we can see the oscillating behaviour due to the alternating burst and quiescent phases .",
    "in particular , in both models the [ o , si / fe ] ratios decrease during the interburst phase and increase again during the bursts . the difference between the two models",
    "resides in the efficiency of the wind in model 7 , which reflects in a stronger variation of the abundance ratios between the burst and the interburst phases .",
    "the reason for this variation in model 7 is that the stronger wind acting during bursts is responsible for very low absolute abundances at the end of each burst , so the increase of fe during the interburst is stronger relatively to model 6 where the absolute abundances at the end of each burst are higher .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that current models for elliptical galaxies ( see matteucci and padovani , 1993 ) would never reproduce such the high n / o ratio observed by molaro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for such low metallicities . in figure 1 , for example , the predictions of models for an elliptical galaxy of initial luminous mass @xmath11 would lie at the right side of the solar neighbourhood curve for only secondary nitrogen , and even in the case of primary n from massive stars would be completely outside of the metallicity region where the dla systems are observed .",
    "the abundance pattern of non refractory elements in some primeval dla systems at high redshift seems not to follow the pattern observed in the halo of the milky way .",
    "this suggests that these objects had a different chemical evolution than the milky way and the spirals in general , at variance with the general belief that dla are the progenitors of present day spirals .",
    "we have shown that the most promising models to explain the observed abundances are those succesfully applied to the dwarf irregular galaxies such as izw18 ( marconi et al .",
    "1994 , kunth et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the conclusion about these dla systems being dwarf galaxies has also been independently suggested by meyer and york ( 1992 ) and by steidel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) from the low abundances found in the few dla observed at low redshifts .      - in order to explain the high n / o ratios observed in two dla systems by green et al .(1995 ) and molaro et al.(1995 ) one has to assume that these systems are dwarf irregular galaxies experiencing their first or one of their first bursts of star formation .",
    "these galaxies should also experience strong enriched galactic winds carrying away mostly the products of sn ii explosions such as oxygen and other @xmath0-elements .",
    "in particular , the high n / o abundance ratios could represent either the situation of an interburst phase where n increases and o does not , or the situation of a burst triggering an extremely strong and enriched galactic wind .",
    "-nitrogen in massive stars should have a primary origin as already suggested by matteucci ( 1986 ) .",
    "this seems to be possible but is strongly dependent on the assumed treatment of convection in stellar interiors .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of n in stars of all masses , especially in low and intermediate mass stars , which are the main producers of this element , needs revision and a homogeneous set of calculations for stars of all masses is required .",
    "new yields , but only for stars below 4 @xmath12 , have been recently computed by marigo et al .",
    "unfortunately , the mass range above that mass limit is very important for nitrogen production and therefore firm conclusions can not yet be drawn .      - some of the differences in the abundances observed among different dla systems could be due to the fact that some of them are proto - spirals ( see the systems observed by pettini et al .",
    "1995 and lipman , 1995 ) and some are proto - dwarfs ( see the systems observed by molaro et al .",
    "1995 and green et al .",
    "1995 )    - abundance ratios between elements produced from stars at different rates such as n / o and @xmath0/fe represent a very useful tool either to date a galaxy or to understand the nature of high red - shift objects ."
