    "the recent discovery of superconductivity @xcite at 39 k in the binary intermetallic mgb@xmath1 , having a simple hexagonal structure consisting of alternating honeycomb layers of b and closed packed layers of mg , has evoked a widespread interest .",
    "initial experiments suggest that the superconductivity in this system arises due to phonon - mediated interaction , as supported by experiments on isotope effect @xcite ; measurements on the superconducting gap by tunnelling @xcite and optical spectroscopy @xcite , as also the decrease of t@xmath4 with the application of pressure @xcite .",
    "there have been several theoretical calculations @xcite that emphasise the importance of electron - phonon coupling , though alternative mechanisms @xcite for superconductivity have also been proposed .",
    "electronic structure calculations in mgb@xmath1 indicate that mg is completely ionised and the bands at the fermi level are derived from @xmath5 orbitals of boron .",
    "there are four distinct zone centre vibrational modes : a silent mode b@xmath6 , the doubly degenerate raman mode , e@xmath7 , and two infrared active modes of a@xmath8 and e@xmath9 symmetry . while there is a general agreement with regard to electronic structure and vibrations ,",
    "the details differ , both with respect to the calculated frequencies and the relative importance of these modes with respect to superconductivity in the system .",
    "for example , in the calculations of an and pickett @xcite , using the deformation potential approach , it is the e@xmath7 mode that is shown to have a dominant coupling with the electrons , whereas in the calculations of kong et al @xcite , the electron phonon interaction is spread over all the modes .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments measuring the vibrational density of states @xcite indicate acoustic modes at less than 40 mev and peaks in the phonon density of states at 54 , 78 , 89 and 97 mev corresponding to the optic modes .",
    "raman scattering measurements @xcite indicate a mode at @xmath2 600 @xmath0 , which is characterised by very large width @xmath2 200 @xmath0 , indicative of strong electron phonon interaction .    in this paper ,",
    "results of infrared absorption measurements on superconducting mgb@xmath1 , covering a spectral range of 125 - 700 @xmath0 , in which the optic modes are predicted to exist , are reported .",
    "in addition supportive experiments have also been carried out in the mid infrared range , upto 2000 @xmath0 .",
    "based on these experiments and comparison with theoretical calculations @xcite , the optic modes of mgb@xmath1 are identified . from studies on the temperature dependence of infrared absorption , it is seen that the optic modes show an interesting temperature variation in that the hardening behaviour at low temperatures is arrested below 100 k , below which they soften .",
    "in addition , the ir mode at 333 @xmath0 shows a distinct softening below t@xmath4 .",
    "the mgb@xmath1 sample used in the present experiments was prepared from mg ( 99.99 @xmath10 ) powder of 50 mesh and b ( 99.98 @xmath10 ) powder of 325 mesh .",
    "the starting materials were thoroughly mixed and put in ta tube that was sealed in ar atmosphere .",
    "this was subsequently sealed in a quartz tube that was heat treated at 1223 k for 2 hours . after cooling down to room temperature",
    ", the polycrystalline lumps were crushed using agate mortar and pestle and subsequently used for experimentation .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements were carried out using cu - k@xmath11 radiation in the bragg - brentano geometry .",
    "ac susceptibilty measurements were carried out with a mutual inductance bridge and lock - in amplifier , using a dipstick cryostat operating in the 4 to 300 k range . the diamagnetic signal corresponding to the sharp superconducting transition at 39 k , and the results of the x - ray diffraction measurements are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the diffraction pattern of mgb@xmath1 can be indexed to hexagnal structure ( p6/mmm ) with lattice parameters : a= 3.0864 a and c=3.5253 a , in agreement with earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the diffraction pattern of crystalline @xmath12 rhombohedral boron is also shown , and it is seen that boron peaks are not discernable in the diffraction pattern of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "however , there are a few peaks that could be associated with mgo , whose concentration is estimated to be @xmath13 . from the powder ac - susceptibilty measurements , using pb powder as standard , the superconducting volume fraction was estimated to be @xmath14 .",
    "infrared absorption measurements were carried out on finely ground mgb@xmath1 sample pelletized along with kbr , using a bomem -da8 spectrometer operating with a resolution of 2 @xmath0 .",
    "measurements in the range of 125 - 700 cm @xmath3 were carried out using a mylar beam splitter and a dtgs detector .",
    "experiments in the mid infrared range of 400 to 2000 @xmath0 have been carried out using the combination of kbr beam splitter and mct detector .",
    "to study the temperature variation of ir modes , the sample was mounted inside a janis continuous flow cryostat in which temperature variation of 300 to 5 k could be achieved .",
    "fig.2 shows the ir absorbance of mgb@xmath1 in the range of 300 to 650 @xmath0 .",
    "the region below 300 @xmath0 is supressed , as it is dominated by kbr absorption .",
    "the absorption spectrum in mgb@xmath1 is characterised by a broad band centred at 485 @xmath0 with shoulders at 333 , 387 @xmath0 .",
    "further sharp features are also noted at 542 , 592 and 633 @xmath0 .",
    "the latter modes match with those of @xmath12 rhombohedral boron @xcite , whose absorption spectrum is also shown .",
    "the occurrence of these modes , while the x - ray diffraction pattern does not indicate the presence of any b ( cf .",
    "1 ) , p points to the activation of b - like modes in mgb@xmath15 due to disorder ( see below ) .",
    "information on the frequencies , widths and intensity of the various phonon modes have been obtained by fitting the absorption curves to a sum of gaussians and a linear background .",
    "the resulting fits along with the components is shown in the right panel of fig.2 , for the two representative temperatures of 297 k and 5 k.    factor group analysis predicts for mgb@xmath15 ( space group p6/mmm , z=1 ) b@xmath6 + e@xmath7 + e@xmath9 + a@xmath8 zone centre optic modes , of which e@xmath9 and a@xmath8 are ir active and e@xmath7 is raman active .",
    "there have been several calculations of these mode frequencies @xcite with a general agreement .",
    "kortus et al @xcite have calculated the two ir active modes of e@xmath9 and a@xmath8 symmetry to be at 320 and 390 @xmath0 respectively and a raman mode of e@xmath7 symmetry at 470 @xmath0 . in the calculations of kong",
    "et al @xcite , carried out using lmto method , the infrared modes are at 335 and 401 @xmath0 and the raman mode is at 585 @xmath0 .",
    "yildrim et al @xcite have calculated the infrared modes to be @xmath16(e@xmath9 ) = 40.7 mev , @xmath16(a@xmath8 ) = 49.8 mev and the raman mode @xmath16(e@xmath7 ) = 74.5 mev .",
    "comparing these theoretical calculations @xcite with our experimental results , we identify the absorption features at 333 and 387 @xmath0 with e@xmath9 and a@xmath8 infrared modes .    as for the absorption band centred at 485 @xmath0 , we first note that it is different from the raman mode identified to be at 560 @xmath0 in the experiments by bohnen et al @xcite and at 620 @xmath0 in the experiments of chen et al @xcite , and goncharov et al @xcite . in all these experiments ,",
    "the raman mode is observed to be very broad @xmath17 @xmath0 .",
    "chen et al @xcite have suggested that this broad feature arises due to disorder which relaxes the momentum selection rule resulting in phonons in the entire brillouin zone being sampled in the raman experiment .",
    "taking cue from this , we note that the broad feature at 485 @xmath0 , observed in the present infrared absorption experiments ( cf .",
    "fig.2 ) can be associated with the peak in the phonon density of states at @xmath2 54 mev , that is seen in the theoretical calculations and neutron scattering experiments@xcite . in effect",
    "the broad absorption band centred at 485 @xmath0 arises due to sampling of the phonons in this energy range over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the exact nature of disorder that is being invoked to account for the absorption spectrum is not clear at present , but could be off - stoichiometry or disorder in the arrangement of layered structure .",
    "we reiterate that the present infrared absorption measurements have been carried out on a sample characterised by sharp x - ray diffraction pattern and superconducting transition ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) .",
    "the results of additional infrared absorption experiments in mgb@xmath15 , carried out over an extended range upto 2000 @xmath0 , are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the absorption spectrum is characterised by a linear background with broad humps centred at 485 , 1040 , 1442 and 1635 @xmath0 . while the band at 1040 @xmath0 matches with crystalline b ( also shown ) , we discount the possibilty of attributing this feature in mgb@xmath15 to the presence of a second phase of b in our sample , since our x - ray diffraction pattern does not indicate the presence of unreacted b. to substatntiate this , we also show in fig .",
    "3b the absorption spectrum of superconducting mgb@xmath15 synthesised from amorphous b. this is also characterised by an absorption band at 1040 @xmath0 , a feature that is absent in the starting amorphous b. this could not have arisen due to crystallisation of amorphous b itself , a process that is known @xcite to occur only beyond 1500 k. from these studies , as also several control infrared and x - ray diffraction experiments on mgb@xmath15 samples in which intentionally crystalline b has been added , and studies @xcite on cu doped mgb@xmath15 , we infer that the absorption spectrum of mgb@xmath15 shown fig.3 , viz .",
    ", as characterised by a linear background with broad bands centred at 485 , 1040 , 1442 and 1635 @xmath0 is intrinsic to the system .",
    "we note that the absorption bands occurring at 1040 , 1442 and 1635 @xmath0 are beyond the range of optic phonons predicted by theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "this once again points to the important role of disorder in this system which may be activating the the high frequency b - like modes @xcite in mgb@xmath15 .",
    "we also note that these high frequency features appear like replication of the absorption band at 485 @xmath0 and hence may be due to combination modes .",
    "the relatively large intensity of these combination modes could be due to the large anharmonicity , which has been shown to exist @xcite in this system .",
    "the temperature dependence of ir absorption in the range of 300 - 650 @xmath0 has been followed across the superconducting transition .",
    "fig.4 summarises the results on the temperature variation of the frequencies and widths of the phonon features at 333 , 387 and 485 @xmath0 .",
    "these are seen to harden initially with the lowering of temperature , but this trend is arrested at @xmath2 100 k , below which they soften .",
    "an anomalous variation is also noticed in the widths , in that they increase with the lowering of temperature .",
    "in contrast , it is seen from fig.5 that the phonon modes at 542 , 592 and 634 @xmath0 , which are b - like modes(cf .",
    "fig.2 ) , indicate a regular behaviour , viz . , a hardening of the modes and a decrease in phonon width with the lowering of temperature .    the observed softening of the mode frequencies below @xmath2 100 k in fig.4 point to a structural anomaly .",
    "while the presence of an incipient structural instability is well known in the case of strong electron phonon coupled superconductors @xcite , this is not clearly established in the case of mgb@xmath1 . in fact the experiments by jorgensen et al @xcite on the variation of lattice parameters of mgb@xmath1 with temperature , down to 11 k , indicate only a continuous decrease in the a and c axis parameters with no anomalies . at the same time , experiments on the suppression of superconductivity with small decrease in c - parameter , obtained by al doping @xcite , is indicative of the fact that mgb@xmath15 is near a structural instabilty .",
    "the present infrared absorption measurements , which shows softening of the phonon modes suggest that there could be a minor increase in c axis parameter below @xmath2100 k. this calls for further detailed structural investigations using techniques such as exafs .    in the case of mode at 333 @xmath0 ,",
    "there is also a distinct softening below t@xmath4 .",
    "while the underlying reason for this behaviour is not clear , we would like to point out that in the experiments of jorgensen et al @xcite , a distinct increase in the debye - waller factor , u@xmath18 , has been observed below t@xmath4 .",
    "this increase in the thermal factor of b along the z axis may have a bearing on the softening of the optic mode , observed in the present investigations .",
    "earlier neutron diffraction measurements by sato et al @xcite indicated an anomolous behaviour of a mode at 17 mev , subsequently discounted in other experiments @xcite . in the studies by yildrim",
    "et al @xcite , no substantial changes in the phonon density of states has been observed with the lowering of temperature from 200 to 7 k. while this is contrary to the present observations , this may be pointing to the sensitivity of infrared absorption measurements to pick up small changes in the mode frequencies with the lowering of temperature .",
    "we also note that while we have seen a small softening of the 333 @xmath0 mode , there is no corresponding change in the width , which is expected to be modified with the appearence of electronic energy gap in the superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "to summarise , through infrared absorption measurements , optic modes in mgb@xmath1 have been identified .",
    "infrared modes are seen at 333 and 387 @xmath0 , in accordance with theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "while the present experiments have been carried out on mgb@xmath15 sample characterised by sharp diffraction peaks and superconducting transition , it is noted that the infrared absorption shows broad features that can be accounted by invoking disorder and the consequent relaxation of momentum selection rule .",
    "the broad band centred at 485 @xmath0 , has been identified with the peak in the phonon density of states and additional broad features corresponding to combination modes are also seen in the present experiments . in effect , the measured absorption spectrum is an indication of the phonon density of states as sampled by the infrared absorption .",
    "these optic modes in the far infrared range exhibit interesting temperature dependence involving a softening below @xmath2 100 k. the implications of this on a possible structural anomaly needs to be investigated .",
    "it is seen that the infrared modes at 333 and 387 @xmath0 are characterised by a widths of @xmath2 40 @xmath0 , which is considerably smaller than the width of the raman mode @xcite @xmath2 200 @xmath0 .",
    "this may be taken as an evidence for the strong electron phonon interaction with the e@xmath7 mode , as has been suggested by theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "however , given that in this system disorder and dispersion effects seem to play a considerable role , to dileneate the electronic contribution to the width and to estimate the electron phonon interaction from the measured widths , using allen formula @xcite , experiments need to be carried out on single crystals of mgb@xmath15 .",
    "this will also help to clarify the possible role , if any , of disorder on the superconductivity in mgb@xmath1 .",
