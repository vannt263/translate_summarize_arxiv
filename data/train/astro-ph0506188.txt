    "millisecond radio pulsars are the product of an extended period of mass and angular momentum transfer to a neutron star ( ns ) from an evolving companion star . this `` recycling '' scenario was proposed @xcite shortly after the discovery of the first binary and recycled pulsars @xcite .",
    "overviews of the mass transfer process are given in several places ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has become clear that there are in fact several sub - classes of recycled pulsars , the most obvious distinction being between those that have ns versus white - dwarf ( wd ) companions . even within the latter category and focusing on galactic field binaries only ,",
    "a wide range of companion masses and evolutionary histories are represented .",
    "one sub - group is the `` intermediate - mass binary pulsars '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which have spin periods of tens of milliseconds and/or companions that are likely massive ( co or onemg ) wds .",
    "many of these systems may have experienced an ultra - high mass transfer rate , or else undergone a period of common - envelope evolution @xcite . among pulsars with lower - mass helium",
    "wd companions , there is another split .",
    "systems whose initial orbital periods were less than the `` bifurcation '' period of about 1 or 2 days @xcite will see their orbits shrink through magnetic braking and gravitational radiation , ultimately forming a low - mass binary pulsar in a tight orbit . systems with longer initial orbital periods undergo stable , long - lived mass transfer via an accretion disk , once the companion star has evolved onto the giant branch .",
    "the resulting systems have long orbital periods of several days or more .",
    "the prototype of this `` wide - orbit binary millisecond pulsar '' ( wbmsp ) group , psr  b1953 + 29 , was one of the first recycled pulsars discovered @xcite ; over the years the number of these pulsars with orbital periods greater than 4 days has grown to 18 .",
    "the wbmsps are the best - understood class of pulsar  wd binaries .",
    "for instance , the companion mass and orbital separation are thought to follow the `` core - mass  orbital - period '' ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) relation , in which the mass of the core which eventually forms the white dwarf is directly related to the size of the envelope of the roche - lobe - filling giant star and hence the orbital radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of companion masses to date ( via pulsar timing or optical spectroscopy ) indicate that this relation is fairly well satisfied @xcite , although we shall discuss this issue further below .",
    "furthermore , although the orbit becomes tidally circularized during the companion s giant phase , fluctuations of convective cells in the giant s envelope force the eccentricity to a non - zero value @xcite ; thus , to within an order of magnitude or so , the eccentricities of these wbmsp systems can be predicted from the orbital periods .",
    "more examples of wbmsp pulsars are needed to further test these predictions , and also to provide additional constraints for population synthesis efforts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these objects are also valuable for constraining departures from general relativity ( gr ) in the form of equivalence principle violations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , some pulsar - wd binaries permit measurement of ns and wd masses through relativistic or geometric timing effects ; thus new systems potentially add to the pool of objects that can be used to constrain theories of the ns interior and/or the amount of matter transferred in different evolutionary processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of three more wbmsps during the parkes multibeam pulsar survey . in   [",
    "sec : obs ] we describe the search and follow - up timing observations . in   [ sec : psrs ] we describe the characteristics of the new pulsars and relate them to evolutionary theory including a comparison with the predictions of the @xmath6@xmath5 relation . in ",
    "[ sec : gr ] we use the ensemble of pulsars with white - dwarf companions to set new , stringent limits on equivalence principle violations . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] we summarize our results and look to the future .",
    "the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) used a 13-beam receiver on the 64-m parkes telescope to search the galactic plane ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) for young and recycled pulsars .",
    "observations were carried out at 1374mhz with 96 channels across a 288mhz bandpass , using 35-minute integrations and 0.25ms sampling .",
    "more than 700 pulsars have been discovered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nearly doubling the previously known population .",
    "the survey processing includes dedispersion of the data at numerous trial dispersion measures , followed by a periodicity search using fast fourier transforms and harmonic summing @xcite .",
    "recently , the entire data volume has been reprocessed using `` acceleration '' searches for pulsars in fast binary orbits , as well as improved interference excision techniques .",
    "this has resulted in a number of new binary and millisecond pulsars ( faulkner et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) , including two of the objects described in this paper .",
    "psr  j1751@xmath92857 has been observed since mjd 51972 with parkes at 1390mhz using a 512-channel filterbank across 256mhz bandwidth and 0.25ms sampling and with the 76 m lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory at 1396mhz using a 64-channel filterbank across 64 mhz with 0.13ms sampling .",
    "psrs  j1853 + 1303 and j1910 + 1256 were discovered in observations taken on mjds 52321 and 52322 , respectively , and identified as candidates using the reaper program selection procedure @xcite .",
    "both were confirmed as pulsars on mjd 52601 .",
    "subsequently , they have been timed at parkes and jodrell bank using the systems described above .",
    "both have also been regularly observed using the 305 m arecibo telescope in puerto rico .",
    "these observations initially used one 100mhz wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) in a fast - sampled `` search '' mode , and , since 2004 feb .",
    ", 3 wapps in an online folding mode , in all cases with 256 lags and 64@xmath10sec sampling .",
    "the single - wapp observations were centered at 1400mhz and when 3 wapps were used they were centered at frequencies of 1170 , 1370 and 1470mhz .",
    "some of the single - wapp observations display timing systematics similar in both pulsars relative to the contemporaneous parkes data ; as this likely reflects instrumental errors in the fairly new wapp , these data points have been left out of the timing analysis .",
    "some of the arecibo observations were flux calibrated using a pulsed noise diode of known strength ; the resulting calibrated profiles are used to determine the flux densities for psrs  j1853 + 1303 and j1910 + 1256 . the flux density for psr  j1751@xmath92857",
    "was determined using the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "the data from each telescope were dedispersed and folded modulo the predicted topocentric pulse period ; this was accomplished off - line for the parkes data and arecibo search - mode data and on - line for the jodrell bank and arecibo folding - mode data .",
    "a time - of - arrival ( toa ) was determined for each observation by cross - correlation with a high signal - to - noise standard template @xcite .",
    "the timestamp for each observation was based on the observatory time standard , corrected by gps to universal coordinated time ( utc ) .",
    "the jpl de200 ephemeris @xcite was used for barycentric corrections .",
    "the timing solutions were found using the standard pulsar timing program tempo , with uncertainties containing a small telescope - dependent amount added in quadrature and scaled to ensure @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting pulsar parameters are shown in table  [ tab : params ] , while the timing residuals and standard pulse profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : resids ] .",
    "we note that the correctly folded arecibo data have rms residuals on the order of 1@xmath10sec per wapp for psr  j1910 + 1256 and 12@xmath10sec per wapp for psr  j1853 + 1303 for roughly 30-minute integrations .",

    "thus the magnitude of @xmath75 and the angle @xmath76 between @xmath77 and @xmath78 are additional parameters .    for any one @xmath79 of the 21 pulsars",
    ", we may then use bayes theorem to write : @xmath80 we compute the integral over @xmath81 and @xmath76 separately , effectively calculating the marginal @xmath82 for a particular set of parameters @xmath83 , @xmath5 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 . for each such set of parameters ,",
    "the angle between @xmath84 and the true @xmath85 , and hence the possible values of @xmath86 for which the likelihood is significantly non - zero , will almost always be very tightly constrained , due to the small measurement errors on @xmath87 and @xmath29 .",
    "we therefore determine the four points representing @xmath88-@xmath89 ranges in both @xmath87 and @xmath29 , and use these to find minimum and maximum values of @xmath81 and @xmath76 .",
    "the likelihood for the set of parameters @xmath83 , @xmath5 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 is then set to 1 for values of @xmath81 and @xmath76 fall between their minimum and maximum values and 0 otherwise .",
    "thus the integral will be roughly proportional to @xmath90 , assuming a uniform prior on @xmath76 and a log prior on @xmath81 .",
    "we set the integral to zero if @xmath91 and use @xmath92 as a lower bound on possible values of @xmath93 ; this conservatively allows each pulsar much more than the eccentricity ranges permitted by @xcite .",
    "this approximation to the likelihood is necessary as both numerical integration over or ( equivalently ) monte carlo sampling of the full allowed ranges of @xmath81 and @xmath76 would be computationally prohibitive .    for the remaining nuisance parameters @xmath83 , @xmath5 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 we perform a monte carlo simulation , drawing @xmath5 uniformly from twice the @xcite @xmath4@xmath5 range , @xmath44 from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 ( combining these two parameters and the mass function yields a value of the pulsar mass @xmath94 ; we use only those systems for which @xmath94 is between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , or other limits set by timing of the individual pulsar ) , @xmath62 from a uniform distribution between @xmath97 and @xmath98 and @xmath61 from a gaussian distribution about the best @xcite distance , assuming a distance uncertainty of 25% , or from a gaussian distribution in parallax , where measured . for psr",
    "j1713 + 0747 , we restrict the parameters @xmath83 , @xmath62 , @xmath94 and @xmath5 to the region constrained by the recent measurement of the orientation of the orbit @xcite , while for psr  j0437@xmath94715 we assume gaussian distributions about the parameters given in @xcite .",
    "we repeat this procedure for values of @xmath53 from 0.00002 to 0.1 , in steps of 0.00002 , then normalize ; this results in the posterior pdf @xmath99 for each pulsar @xmath79 . for psr  j1713 + 0747 alone ,",
    "the resulting 95% confidence limit on @xmath1 is about 0.0158 , similar to the value derived in @xcite .",
    "the pulsar data sets are independent , and thus we multiply the pdfs to derive @xmath58 . from this , we derive a 95% confidence upper limit on @xmath1 of @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_sep ] shows the pdf curves for this test .",
    "we note that while a logarithmic prior on @xmath1 would result in an upper limit a few orders of magnitude smaller , we have chosen a uniform prior on @xmath1 in order to be as conservative as possible and more consistent with previous work .    for the @xmath54 test ,",
    "we proceed in a similar fashion . here",
    "the forced eccentricity is @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the gravitational self - energy fraction of `` compactness '' of the pulsar , approximated by @xmath103 @xcite , and @xmath104 is the ( unknown ) angle between the pulsar s absolute velocity @xmath105 ( relative to the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background ) and its spin vector . for this test",
    ", we also need the 3-dimensional velocity of the system . where proper motion measurements are available , we draw from gaussian distributions for the proper motion to get the transverse velocities ; in other cases , and always for the unknown radial velocities , we draw from gaussian distributions in each dimension centered on the galactic rotational velocity vector at the pulsar location and with widths of 80 kms@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we sample uniform steps of @xmath106 ranging from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "we find a 95% confidence upper limit on @xmath109 of @xmath2 . figure  [ fig : pdf_a3 ] shows the pdf curves for this test .",
    "the 95% confidence limits we derive of @xmath0 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath109 are considerably better than previous limits of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively @xcite , while still taking into account the contribution from all pulsars with similar evolutionary histories . the sep test appears weaker than the best solar - system tests of @xmath112 @xcite but pulsars test the strong - field regime inaccessible to the solar - system measurements and are therefore qualitatively different .",
    "the @xmath113 test is nearly thirteen orders of magnitude better than tests derived from the perihelion shifts of earth and mercury @xcite , and again tests the strong - field regime of gravity .",
    "of the three new wbmsp systems presented here , at least two can be timed at the microsecond level with current instrumentation at large telescopes .",
    "these objects thus show promise for measurement of geometrical and/or relativistic timing phenomena in future , giving us an idea of the system inclination angles and perhaps the masses of the objects .",
    "this information will be extremely useful in evaluating the validity of the @xmath4@xmath5 relations for estimations of companion masses .",
    "all three systems should provide proper motion measurements within a few years ; these will add to our understanding of millisecond pulsar velocities throughout their population . finally , in combination with the other low - mass circular - orbit systems discovered in recent years , the new pulsars set firmer limits on violations of relativistic equivalence principles in the strong - field regime of @xmath0 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath109",
