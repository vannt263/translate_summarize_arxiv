    "low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary systems in which a @xmath51@xmath6 star transfers matter to a neutron star or a black hole",
    ". a large fraction of the lmxbs are transient , the so called soft x  ray transients ( sxts ; see ) .",
    "characterising properties of sxts are i ) the accretion rate drops several orders of magnitude when the source returns to quiescence ( ) and ii ) the spectra become soft when in outburst .",
    "there are several mechanisms which can produce the low  level x  ray emission observed in quiescence ( see for an overview ) .",
    "firstly , mass accretion may be ongoing at a low level possibly via an adaf type flow ( e.g. ) .",
    "secondly , provided the neutron star has a substantial magnetic field ( @xmath7 gauss ) and a short spin period ( milliseconds ) , centrifugal forces may prevent accretion onto the neutron star ( the propeller mechanism ; ) .",
    "shocks produced by this propeller mechanism are then responsible for the x  ray emission .",
    "thirdly , the switch  on of a radio pulsar mechanism may produce x  rays ( ) . finally , the neutron star core and crust are heated by accretion episodes during outburst ; subsequent cooling of the neutron star in quiescence produces ( soft ) x  rays , ( e.g. ; ) .",
    "sxts have been studied both in outburst and in quiescence with various satellites ( e.g. with rosat , with asca , with rxte , with beppo_sax _ ) . from these studies a basic picture of the outburst mechanism has emerged ; the thermal  viscous disk instability model ( , , ; for a recent review and a more detailed account see ) .",
    "recent observations of neutron star sxts in quiescence with the _ chandra _ and xmm_newton _ satellites have fueled the debate on the nature of the quiescent x  ray emission ( e.g. see and ) .",
    "furthermore , using data obtained with the beppo_sax _ satellite and suggested that @xmath110 bursting neutron stars form a separate class of _ faint _ sxts .",
    "some may have a low peak  luminosity ( typically @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 ) , possibly like the accreting millisecond x  ray pulsar sax  j1808.43658 (; ) .",
    "later , showed that a class of faint sxt is expected on evolutionary grounds .",
    "these are systems which have evolved beyond the period minimum of @xmath180 minutes to orbital periods of 80120 minutes .",
    "recently , proposed that the excess emission near 0.6 kev , unaccounted for by continuum models , found in a handful of x  ray binaries ( among which 4u  162667 , which has an orbital period of @xmath141 minutes ; ) can be explained by varying the absorption abundances of circumstellar o and ne with respect to solar .",
    "the abundances and the ultra  short orbital periods of several of these systems can be explained providing these systems are accreting from a degenerate companion (;",
    "see for detailed evolutionary considerations ) .",
    "recently , two other transient accreting millisecond x  ray pulsars have been found , xte  j1751305 (; ) and xte  j0929314 (; ) with orbital periods of @xmath142 and @xmath143 minutes , respectively . these systems fit  in with the class of ultra  short period binaries . however , despite the fact that these millisecond pulsars have short orbital periods xmm_newton _ observations of xte  j1751305 and _ chandra _ observations with the low energy transmission grating spectrometer of xte  j0929314 did not show evidence for excess emission near 0.6 kev , complicating the picture (; ) .",
    "rx  j170930.2263927 was discovered by the rosat all sky survey ( ) . in 1997",
    "the source was found in outburst with the proportional counter array onboard the rxte satellite ( ) .",
    "using beppo_sax _ s wide field camera , found that the source exhibits bursts , probably type  i x  ray bursts , which would establish the compact object in rx  j170930.2263927 as a neutron star .    in this paper we present results from _ chandra _ observations of the sxt rx  j170930.2 - 263927 obtained during the decay after an x  ray outburst .",
    "we observed rx  j170930.2263927 five times with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) back  illuminated s3 chip onboard the _ chandra _ satellite ( ) . a log of the observations is given in table  [ log ] . to mitigate the effects of pile  up the acis s3 chip",
    "was read out in _ continuous clocking _",
    "mode during the first four observations ( cc  mode , providing a time resolution as high as 2.85 ms ) and in a windowed timed exposure mode during the last observation ( te  mode ; time resolution of 2.24 s ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      the rosat satellite observed and detected rx  j170930.2263927 twice .",
    "the source was first detected in the rosat all sky survey observations on august 21 , 1990 ( ) .",
    "we analysed these archival rosat data using the ftool xselect ( lheasoft version 5.2 ) .",
    "the 0.22.4 kev rosat spectrum was fitted with an absorbed blackbody . fixing the amount of absorption to the value we found using the _ chandra _ observations ( n@xmath10 @xmath11 ) a blackbody temperature of 0.22@xmath120.01 kev and radius of ( 2@xmath120.5)@xmath13 km were found .",
    "the unabsorbed source flux ( 0.110 kev ) was 4.8@xmath14 erg @xmath11 s@xmath9 .",
    "the source was also in the field of view of a @xmath1900  s pointed pspc observation of the source v2051  oph obtained on september 22 , 1992 ( see also ) .",
    "the 0.22.4 kev source spectrum was well fit by an absorbed blackbody of a temperature of 0.22@xmath120.02 kev and a radius of ( 2.9@xmath121.0)@xmath15 km ( again the n@xmath0 was fixed at @xmath16 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed source flux ( 0.110 kev ) was 7.3@xmath17 erg @xmath11 s@xmath9 .",
    "we observed the soft x  ray transient ( sxt ) rx  j170930.2263927 five times with the _ chandra _ satellite in march april 2002 after an x  ray outburst . the spectrum of the source was well fit by a model consisting of two blackbodies and a power law , all absorbed by interstellar absorption ( taking into account excess absorption due to contamination of the acis optical blocking filters . )",
    "fit blackbody temperatures and radii ( see table 2 ) imply that the accretion disk contribution is soft ( blackbody temperature of 0.10.2 kev ) and that there is a contribution from a hotter ( blackbody temperature of @xmath10.6 kev ) , smaller site , possibly the neutron star or the neutron star boundary layer . in the accreting millisecond pulsar xte  j0929314 an 0.6 kev blackbody component has been found as well ( ) , whereas in xte  j1751305 the blackbody temperature is @xmath11 kev ( ) . with a power law index of 1.11.5 the power law index is somewhat harder than typical for lmxbs ; they have indices s of @xmath12 (; ) .",
    "the spectral fits of the first two _ chandra _ observations showed evidence for excess emission at @xmath10.6 kev . such an excess has been found in other lmxbs as well and has been identified with a blend of emission lines from o  vii ",
    "o  viii and/or fe xvii  fe  xix ( ) .",
    "recently , showed that this excess can also be explained by an enhanced ne / o ratio with respect to solar .",
    "since two of the sources which show such an excess have an ultra short orbital period and the other sources have low absolute visual magnitudes , it was proposed that this enhanced ne / o ratio is due to the fact that the compact objects are accreting matter of a neon  rich degenerate dwarf in ultracompact systems . in rx",
    "j170930.2263927 the excess can be well  fit by a gaussian line with an equivalent width of @xmath15080 ev centred at @xmath10.59 kev .",
    "could the extra emission component in the spectrum be due to the enhanced absorption due to the contamination of the optical blocking filters ?",
    "tests performed by the _ chandra _ x  ray center show that the model describing the excess absorption as a function of time is better than 10% except near the c k  edge but this edge falls outside the spectral range we considered . we included this 10 per cent as a systematic uncertainty in our fits for channels below 1 kev ; still we found excess emission near 0.6 kev .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that this excess emission is due to the imperfect correction for the contamination of the optical blocking filters . hence ,",
    "if the 0.6 kev excess is a unique feature of ultracompact x  ray binaries rx  j170930.2263927 has a short orbital period as well .",
    "so far , two outbursts of rx  j170930.2263927 have been observed with rxte s asm since the launch of rxte ( december 1995 ) .",
    "both outburst profiles show a steepening of the decay approximately 50 days after the start of the outburst ( see for a figure of the first outburst profile , and figure  [ decay ] for the profile of this outburst ) .",
    "such a steepening in the decay of the outburst has been observed in other sxts as well ; this steepening has been interpreted as evidence for the onset of the propeller mechanism (;",
    "aql  x1 , ; sax  j1808.43658 , )",
    ". however , since type  i x  ray bursts are observed after the alleged onset of the propeller mechanism (; this work ) this means that mass accretion must be ongoing after the steepening of the decay .",
    "furthermore , found that in the accreting millisecond x  ray pulsar sax  j1808.43658 pulsation were found after the supposed onset of the propeller effect .",
    "together , these findings pose a serious problem for the interpretation of the steepening of the decay as being due to the onset of the propeller mechanism .",
    "no pulsations have been reported for rx  j170930.2263927 ( we determined a 95 per cent upper limit to pulsations in the frequency range 1001000 hz of 4.4 per cent fractional rms amplitude using the archival rxte / pca observation [ 260 kev ; i d 20208 - 01 - 02 - 00 ] obtained during the previous outburst ) .    from the spectral fits and",
    "the hardness ratio ( see table  [ fluxunabs ] ) it was found that the source spectrum softened considerably between the third and fourth observation .",
    "typically the spectra of sxts become soft when @xmath18 erg s@xmath9 ( ) .",
    "it is unclear what causes this softening , but it has been shown that the spectra of accreting neutron stars become soft for low mass accretion rates ( ) .    the best ",

    "a more accurate calculation of the interstellar absorption in the direction of rx  j170930.2263927 based on the work of finds n@xmath200.34@xmath19@xmath11 .",
    "possibly , some of the absorption is local to the system . given the high galactic latitude of the source this provides a lower limit to the source distance of 2.5 kpc .",
    "we detected a burst from rx  j170930.2263927 .",
    "due to effects of pile  up , the first 20  s of the burst could not be used for spectral analysis .",
    "analysis of the data obtained during the later stages of the burst showed evidence of spectral cooling , making it likely that this is a type  i x  ray burst , establishing the nature of the compact object of this transient as a neutron star ( confirming the findings of ) .",
    "the burst e ",
    "folding time of 38@xmath123 seconds makes it a typical mixed he / h burst ; this is not contradicting the possibility that rx  j170930.2263927 is accreting from a hydrogen deficit donor star as showed that nearly all metals will be destroyed in the atmosphere of the neutron star due to spallation processes .",
    "derived an upper limit to the distance of rx  j170930.2263927 of 10@xmath121 kpc by assuming that the peak burst flux is less than the eddington luminosity for a 1.4 m@xmath3 neutron star ( l@xmath21 erg s@xmath9 ) .",
    "approximately the same upper limit is derived assuming that the peak _ outburst _ flux ( 12@xmath22 @xmath23 ) is less then the eddington limit for a 1.4 m@xmath3 neutron star .",
    "if the distance to rx  j170930.2263927 is less then 45 kpc the source outburst luminosity is low and the source outburst luminosity fits in with that of the proposed class of faint sxts (; ) .",
    "we analysed data of rx  j170930.2263927 obtained by the rosat satellite .",
    "rosat observed and detected the source twice ; once in august 1991 at a 0.110 kev unabsorbed flux level of 4.8@xmath14 erg @xmath11 s @xmath9 ( l@xmath24 @xmath25 erg s@xmath9 ) , and once in september 1992 at an unabsorbed flux level ( 0.110 kev ) of 7.3@xmath17 erg @xmath11 s @xmath9 ( l@xmath26 @xmath27 erg s@xmath9 ) . since the possiblity that rosat observed the source during an outburst is low",
    "given the fact that the asm only observed two outbursts in over 6 years , we conclude that rx  j170930.2263927 must either have had a much shorter outburst interval time when the rosat observations were made , or that the source is active for a long time at a low luminosity level , similar to the neutron star sxts sax  j1808.43658 ( ) , 4u  160852 ( ) , aql  x1 ( ) , sax  j1747.02853 ( ) , and exo  0748676 .",
    "variability of ongoing low ",
    "level accretion in these transient systems could provide an alternative explanation for some of the _ faint _ sxt sources ( ) . as was explained by low level accretion in transient sources and variability therein",
    "could also explain the properties of several of the faint burst sources detected with the _ beppo_sax satellite .",
    "variability up to a factor of 10 has been observed during ongoing low ",
    "level accretion in 4u  160852 ( ) whereas much larger variations ( up to a factor 1000 in 5 hours ) have been observed in sax  j1808.43658 ( ) .",
    "black hole candidate sxts have also shown activity after the decay of an outburst ( e.g. 4u  163047 , ) .",
    "it is unclear whether rx  j170930.2263927 was already in quiescence during our last _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the source luminosity during the last observation was between @xmath28@xmath29 erg s@xmath9 for a distance of 2.510 kpc , respectively .",
    "this luminosity range is consistent with the luminosity expected from cooling of a neutron star core ( ) , although for a distance of 2.5 kpc the luminosity is rather low .",
    "the ratio between the outburst flux and quiescence flux is @xmath30 ( see fig .  [ decay ] ) ; this is similar to that of cen  x4 .",
    "the outburst recurence time is @xmath15 years and the outburst duration is @xmath1100 days ( as determined from the rxte / asm records ) .",
    "possibly , the time averaged mass accretion rate is an order of magnitude ( or more ) lower than 10@xmath31 m@xmath3 yr@xmath9 , leaving the neutron star core relatively cold .",
    "the quiescent core luminosity after the neutron star crust has cooled should be very low ( 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath9 , for a time averaged mass accretion rate of 10@xmath33 year@xmath9 , respectively ) .",
    "such a low time averaged mass accretion rate is not unfeasible for ultracompact systems ( e.g. see ) .",
    "however , the fluence of the march  april 2002 outburst of rx  j170930.2263927 is @xmath34 erg @xmath11 . for a recurrence time of five years",
    "this leads to a time averaged flux of 1.3@xmath35 erg @xmath11 s@xmath9 and @xmath36m@xmath37 m@xmath3 yr@xmath9 @xmath38 , making it unlikely that the neutron star core is very cold as the result of a very low time  averaged mass accretion rate .",
    "alternatively , enhanced neutrino cooling of the core ( ) may take place ; this could occur for massive neutron stars ( 1.71.8 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "the low quiescent luminosity of the accreting millisecond x  ray pulsar sax  j1808.43658 can also be explained by enhanced core cooling ( ) .    from the _ chandra _ acis  te observation we derived an accurate position for rx  j170930.2263927 .",
    "we note that this position is @xmath1910 arcminutes away from the centre of the metal  poor globlar cluster ngc  6293 at a distance of 8.5 kpc ( although the uncertainties in the cluster distance are considerable ; ) .",
    "this globular cluster has a tidal radius of 14.2 arcminutes ( ) .",
    "it is not unfeasible that the source was slung out of the globular cluster by interactions with other more massive components in the globular cluster .",
    "if the association is real and not a chance alignment , rx  j170930.2263927 has a projected distance of @xmath39 pc from the centre of the cluster .",
    "if the source is unassociated with the globular cluster it has travelled from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "e.g. for a distance of 8.5 kpc rx  j170930.2263927 is 1.2 kpc above the galactic plane ; assuming rx  j170930.2263927 was born in the galactic plane and it is at the highest point in its galactic orbit , the initial space velocity must at least have been 120 km s@xmath9 ( we used the potential for the galaxy used by in the implementation of ) .",
    "we did not detect the optical counterpart with a five sigma upper limit of m@xmath4020.5 .",
    "the upper limit on the absolute magnitude of the counterpart to rx  j170930.2263927 is @xmath13.5 for an optical visual extinction of 2.4 magnitudes ( taking n@xmath10 @xmath11 , the relation between n@xmath0 and a@xmath41 of , and a distance of 8.5 kpc [ if the source is closer than that the absolute optical magnitude will be larger ] ) .",
    "this absolute optical magnitude is large for an lmxb ( cf . ) .",
    "although , since our optical observations were performed when rx  j170930.2263927 was most likely in quiescence it is difficult to compare this absolute optical magnitude with the work of as those authors considered actively accreting sources . during periods of accretion sxts are known to be much brighter in optical than in quiescence ( in case of the black hole candidate a  062000 the optical magnitude decreased by @xmath17 magnitudes , see ) . since it is unknown by how much rx  j170930.2263927 brightened in outburst it is unclear what the absolute optical magnitude was .",
    "however , from the upper limit on the absolute visual magnitude we derive that the spectral type of the companion must be later than f5g0 , making rx  j170930.2263927 a low  mass x  ray binary , unless the distance to the source is much larger than 8.5 kpc .",
