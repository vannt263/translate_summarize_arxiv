    "@xcite presented a search for infrared counterparts to galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) that were sampled by the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) legacy survey @xcite .",
    "the glimpse survey imaged the inner galactic plane  specifically the galactic latitude and longitude ranges of @xmath10@xmath11@xmath10@xmath121@xmath13 and 10@xmath13@xmath14@xmath15@xmath1665@xmath13 , respectively  at four wavelength bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath17 m ) with the infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite aboard the",
    "_ spitzer space telescope _",
    "the results presented by @xcite were very intriguing : of the 95 snrs known ( at the time ) that were sampled by glimpse , eighteen snrs were detected ( many for the first time ) and the infrared emission from these sources typically coincided ( at least partially ) with known radio structures . @xcite also presented simple models to generate template colors in the irac bands for the primary emission mechanisms expected from snrs .",
    "these primary emission mechanisms include the following : ( i ) _ molecular _ line colors that were estimated using a three temperature component h@xmath18 excitation model based on numerous h@xmath18 lines detected toward ic 443 @xcite , ( ii ) _ ionized _ gas line colors that were estimated based on hydrogen recombination as well as the dominant fine - structure lines of iron and argon ( assuming solar abundances ) and ( iii ) interstellar medium ( ism ) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) colors that were estimated using a spectrum of the reflection nebula ngc 7023 . in their analysis",
    ", @xcite found that the spectra of nine snrs , three snrs and four snrs were dominated by molecular lines , fine - structure lines and pahs , respectively .",
    "the spectra of the remaining snrs indicated a mixture of ionic and molecular shocks , suggesting a combination of shock types .",
    "interestingly , many of the snrs detected with irac also appear to be interacting with relatively dense gas .",
    "evidence for such interactions is the excess emission detected from these snrs at a wavelength of 4.5 @xmath17 m : such an excess is likely produced by h@xmath18 and co line emission and such line emission is associated with molecular shocks .",
    "furthermore , follow - up spectroscopy observations conducted with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) aboard _ spitzer _  @xcite revealed h@xmath18 emission from all of the snrs with irac by the survey conducted by @xcite , suggesting that each of these snrs are interacting with molecular clouds @xcite . we shall refer to these snrs as molecular snrs for the remainder of the paper .",
    "several molecular snrs are detected in the x - ray ( see @xcite for a review of x - ray emission from snrs ) and all of them belong to the class of sources known as mixed - morphology snrs ( mm snrs ) .",
    "the distinguishing characteristics of mm snrs are a center - filled thermal x - ray morphology paired with a well - defined radio shell @xcite .",
    "examples of well - known mm snrs include w28 , w44 and 3c 391 : each of these snrs was observed in the infrared with the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; * ? ? ?",

    "( iso ) @xcite and h@xmath18 emission was detected from all three snrs @xcite .",
    "many of the molecular snrs detected by @xcite have not been well - studied in the x - ray , probably because the galactic column densities toward these sources are elevated ( @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath3 10@xmath21 @xmath22 ) , causing them to appear to be faint in the x - ray . in this paper",
    "we describe the x - ray properties of five molecular snrs detected by @xcite : kes 17 ( g304.6@xmath00.1 ) , g311.5@xmath10.3 , g346.6@xmath10.2 , ctb 37a ( g348.5@xmath00.1 ) and g348.5@xmath10.0 . for this study",

    "these snrs had been studied almost exclusively in the radio before the infrared observations made with _",

    "we note that three of these snrs ( kes 17 , g346.6@xmath10.2 and ctb 37a ) have been the subjects of pointed _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations that have been described and analyzed in separate publications @xcite .",

    "g348.5@xmath10.0 which appear adjacent to each other in the sky , these particular sources were located too close to the edges of the gis fields of view to extract useful spectra . in addition , as noted by @xcite , contaminating stray flux from bright x - ray sources located out of the field of view and south of these two snrs made it difficult to isolate their x - ray emission ( see section [ xmmg348section ] for more details , particularly about our attempt to extract x - ray spectra for g348.5@xmath10.0 from the _ xmm - newton _ observation , which also contained contaminating stray x - ray flux ) .",

    "therefore , we also extracted sis spectra of this snr as well .",
    "unfortunately the signal - to - noise of the extracted sis1 source spectrum of kes 17 was too poor for any detailed spectral fitting , so we do not consider it further in this paper .",

    "for example , in the case of w44 , @xcite found significant residuals at @xmath31.5 kev and @xmath3 2 kev , which are attributed to the mg - ly@xmath40 line and the si - ly@xmath40 line , respectively . in the cases of w44 @xcite ,",
    "ic 443 @xcite and g359.1 - 0.5 @xcite , residuals that emerged after fitting with cie models are seen at 2.7 and 3.5 kev : lines at these energies are associated with h - like si ( 2.67 kev ) and h - like s ( 3.48 kev ) , respectively .",
    "finally , in the case of w49b , @xcite identified residuals at the energies of 5.6 , 6.2 , 6.7 , 6.9 , 7.9 , 8.5 kev : these lines are attributed to cr k@xmath40 , mn@xmath40 and four fe lines ( of he@xmath114 , ly@xmath40 , he@xmath115 and he@xmath46 ) , respectively .    we have examined the x - ray spectra of the snrs in our sample to search for evidence of overionized plasmas associated with these sources . unfortunately , in the case of ctb 37a , the extracted _ chandra _ spectra do not have sufficiently high signal - to - noise to reveal significant residuals ( if present ) : therefore , there is no clear evidence that the x - ray emitting plasma associated with this snr is overionized .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed _ suzaku _ spectra of g346.6@xmath10.2 and argued that the plasma associated with this snr is overionized .",
    "unfortunately the signal - to - noise of our _ asca _ spectra of g346.6@xmath10.2 is insufficient for a study of the overionization of this snr .",
    "inspection of the _ asca _ spectra reveals a hint of residual dips at 1.5 kev ( note the residuals between 1.5 - 2.5 kev as shown in figure [ g346spectra ] ) .",
    "the residual at 1.5 kev ( which is consistent with the mg ly@xmath40 line ) could be evidence of over - ionization as seen in w44 @xcite but the scatter is too large to quantify the overionization .",
    "lastly , the signal - to - noise of our _ asca _ spectra of g311.5@xmath10.3 is too poor to identify any lines , while g348.5@xmath10.0 was not clearly detected by any of the x - ray observations considered here .",
    "examination of the mos1+mos2+pn spectra of kes 17 ( as shown in figure [ kes17_mos1mos2pn_spectra ] ) reveals evidence for residuals at 1.5 kev ( a positive dip ) and 1.9 kev ( a negative dip ) .",
    "based on the presence of these residuals , we have investigated whether or not the x - ray - emitting plasma associated with kes 17 is indeed overionized .",
    "we conducted a spectral analysis patterned after the analysis presented by @xcite where those authors determined that the x - ray - emitting plasma associated with g346.6@xmath10.2 is overionized . using the spex software package @xcite , those authors fitted the extracted _ suzaku _ xis spectra of the snr using the neij model .",
    "as described by @xcite , this model describes an x - ray emitting plasma where initially the ion temperature @xmath2@xmath116 and the original electron temperature @xmath2@xmath117 were the same ( that is , @xmath2@xmath116 = @xmath2@xmath117 ) and the plasma itself was in collisional ionization equilibrium . over time , the electron temperature drops to @xmath2@xmath118 due to rapid electron cooling .",
    "such a model can reflect accurately a rapid electron cooling as predicted in models of snr evolution .",
    "in addition , the neij model was multiplied by the absm model to account for interstellar absorption ( also consistent with the work of @xcite ) .",
    "we first used the spex ( version 2.03.03 ) tool trafo ( version 1.02 ) to convert the extracted _ xmm - newton _ spectral files for the whole snr into .spo files suitable for analysis by the software package .",
    "we were unable to generate a statistically - acceptable fit with the neij model that is superior ( in other words , with an improved value for @xmath53@xmath67@xmath42 ) to the fits obtained with the thermal models described above .",
    "the residuals of the fits obtained with the neij model originate from inconsistencies between the different datasets and because of these limitations the overionization model can not improve the fit .",
    "thus , the poor signal - to - noise of the datasets prevent us from testing sufficiently whether or not the x - ray - emitting plasma is overionized .",
    "a deeper x - ray observation is required to investigate more rigorously the possibility that kes 17 belongs to the class of overionized mm snrs .",
    "in table [ snrxraystable ] we present a summary of the properties of the diffuse emission associated with the four snrs examined in this paper that were detected in the x - ray .",
    "we find that the x - ray properties of three of these snrs  kes 17 , g311.5@xmath10.3 and ctb 37a  are similar to those of such archetypal mm snrs as 3c 391 and w44 @xcite . specifically , the x - ray temperatures of these three snrs range from @xmath2@xmath30.7 kev to @xmath2@xmath31 kev , the abundances of the diffuse emission associated with each snr are approximately solar and all of the snrs are middle - aged ( that is , the ages of all of the snrs are @xmath6@xmath7@xmath310@xmath108 yr old ) .",
    "lastly , all three of these snrs are known to produce infrared emission that originates from shocked molecular hydrogen ( that is , warm h@xmath18 ) : this indicates that these snrs are interacting with dense ( 10@xmath119 - 10@xmath120 @xmath50 ) molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude these three particular snrs in our sample are similar to the archetypal mm snrs listed above and others ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray properties of g346.6@xmath10.2 differ somewhat from both those of these three mm snrs as well as those of the archetypical mm snrs .    while g346.6@xmath10.2 does feature a center - filled thermal x - ray morphology with a contrasting well - defined shell - like radio morphology that typifies mm snrs ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this snr is harder with a higher temperature and the presence of a second harder spectral component is implied .",
    "the morphology shows center - filled x - ray emission within a well - defined radio shell like those in other mm snrs .",
    "however , the x - ray spectrum is harder than these other mm snrs ( with a higher temperature , @xmath2@xmath32.5 - 3.4 kev ) and the fitted ionization timescale is rather lower .",
    "we do note however that an age estimate based on the observed infrared line emission from this snr  recall that the shock velocity used in our analysis is based on detected ionic infrared emission  is similar to the ages estimated for kes 17 , g311.5@xmath10.3 , ctb 37a and the archetypal mm snrs mentioned above .",
    "we do not have a clear idea why g346.6@xmath10.2 shows harder x - ray emission , but perhaps it is somehow related to a particular property of this snr : the detected h@xmath18 emission from g346.6@xmath10.2 differs from the h@xmath18 emission detected from the other mm snrs in that the detected emission from g346.6@xmath10.2 requires a high velocity j - shock component or a high - velocity c - shock component coupled with a slow - velocity c - shock component to be fit properly .",
    "in contrast , the emission detected from the other snrs requires two slow c - shock components .",
    "it is possible that the x - ray emission from g346.6@xmath10.2 is associated with the forward shock of this snr , which is necessarily a j - shock because c - shocks do not shock - heat the plasmas of snrs .",
    "in addition , or perhaps as an alternate explanation , c - shocks are associated with lower shock velocities : this might indicate that g346.6@xmath10.2 is dynamically a younger snr .",
    "therefore , this would be an indirect connection between the shock and the x - ray emission seen from the interior of this snr .",
    "more x - ray observations of this intriguing snr are clearly warranted .",
    "observations made with the _ fermi _ telescope have detected many mm snrs at @xmath46-ray energies , including w28 , w44 , w49b , w51c and ic 443 @xcite , among others ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath46-ray emission detected from these sources may be explained as hadronic particle acceleration by the mm snrs expanding into a dense environment .",
    "of the five snrs considered in this paper , two  kes 17 and ctb 37a  have been detected at @xmath46-ray energies : kes 17 was detected by _",
    "@xcite , while ctb 37a was detected with very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath46-ray telescopes @xcite and _ fermi _ @xcite .",
    "our present research has helped to confirm that kes 17 and ctb 37a are mm snrs that feature center - filled x - ray emission .",
    "we argue that additional @xmath46-ray observations of mm snrs are needed to investigate the inter - relationship between x - ray and @xmath46-ray emission from these particular sources and mechanisms of particle acceleration .",
    "we note that infrared observations of the five snrs considered in this paper have revealed that the infrared emission detected from these snrs is radiative and produced by shocks with velocities @xmath99@xmath102@xmath370 to 150 km s@xmath73 .",
    "it appears that each of these snrs is currently in the snowplow stage of evolution and the x - ray emission detected from kes 17 , g311.5@xmath10.3 , g346.6@xmath10.2 and ctb 37a is fossil radiation that was produced during an earlier evolutionary stage of the snrs . the x - ray emission from several mm snrs  as observed by _ suzaku _",
    " often exhibits multiple ionization states which come from elemental differences in ionization and recombination timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the rarefaction of the recombining plasma is likely due to continuous fast cooling of the plasma due to radiative shocks encountering dense clouds ( as inferred by the characteristics of the detected infrared emission from these snrs ) .",
    "our sample of four x - ray - detected mm snrs in this paper help confirm that a strong correlation exists between infrared shocked h@xmath18 emitting snrs and mm snrs .",
    "we also note that _ chandra _ observations of other mm snrs  such as w44 and 3c 391  have confirmed the presence of uniform temperature profiles in x - ray emission from these sources @xcite .",
    "in addition , wide ranges of plasma conditions and metal enrichment have also been revealed by _ asca _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observations of mm snrs , such as an over - ionized plasma in ic 443 @xcite , a suggested abundance gradient at the bright projected center of w44 @xcite and iron - rich ejecta in the mm snrs 3c 397 and sgr a east @xcite .",
    "finally , evidence for x - ray emission from an ejecta - dominated plasma associated with ic 443 as detected by _ xmm - newton _ was presented by @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown that the center - filled thermal x - ray emission as observed in mm snrs can be produced through anisotropic thermal conduction .",
    "specifically , snrs expanding into denser environments tend to be smaller , making it easier for thermal conduction to dictate large changes in the temperatures of their expanding hot gas bubbles .",
    "therefore , thermal conduction plays a prominent role in determining the observed x - ray morphology of mm snrs @xcite .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) modeling of snrs expanding through an inhomogeneous ism also confirms that x - ray emission detected from mm snrs can be reproduced when both thermal conduction and the reverse shock of the snr are included in the modeling @xcite .",
    "after the reverse shock has reached the center of the snr , a maximum in the x - ray emission is seen toward the center of the snr and the morphology is centrally brightened : such a morphology is a defining characteristic of mm snrs .",
    "therefore , it is evident that thermal conduction plays a crucial role in producing snrs of this class .",
    "follow - up x - ray observations of the mm snrs in our sample are vital to investigate further their properties . while these snrs have already been observed with such current x - ray observatories as _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ and _ suzaku",
    "_ , we argue that a deeper observing campaign of these snrs ( as well as other known mm snrs ) is crucial and will permit detailed comparisons between these snrs to be made .",
    "analysis of the x - ray spectra obtained from these observations will allow us to investigate the line emission of elements present in the x - ray emitting plasma of these sources , specifically their ionization states and temperatures .",
    "such analysis may also reveal the presence of enhanced elemental abundances in the ejecta emission : this phenomenon has been seen in other mm snrs .",
    "finally , @xmath46-ray observations of the mm snrs in our sample which have not yet been detected at such high energies  such as g311.5@xmath10.3 and g346.6@xmath10.2  as well as other mm snrs are clearly warranted .",
    "the detection of @xmath46-ray emission from such sources will provide exciting opportunities to advance our understanding of particle acceleration by these sources .",
    "the conclusions of this paper may be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) using archival x - ray observations made with _",
    "asca _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , we have conducted a spectroscopic analysis of the x - ray properties of five snrs ( kes 17 , g311.5@xmath10.3 , g346.6@xmath10.2 , ctb 37a and g348.5@xmath10.0 ) detected in the infrared by the _",
    "glimpse survey .",
    "four of the five snrs ( namely kes 17 , g311.5@xmath10.3 , g346.6@xmath10.2 and ctb 37a ) are clearly detected by these observations and we have placed an upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of g348.5@xmath10.0 ) .",
    "our work represents the first published detection of x - ray emission from g311.5@xmath10.3 .",
    "\\2 ) the four x - ray detected snrs all feature a center - filled x - ray morphology with a contrasting shell - like radio morphology : therefore , these sources may be classified as mm snrs .",
    "the x - ray emission from each snr appears to be thermal in origin : however , when the spectral properties of the x - ray - emitting plasmas of the snrs are compared , significant variations are seen from one snr to the other .",
    "for example , the plasma associated with kes 17 may be overabundant in magnesium , suggesting that the plasma may be ejecta - dominated .",
    "in addition , evidence exists for the presence of hard components in the x - ray emission from g346.6@xmath10.2 .",
    "we also note that we have identified a hard discrete x - ray source seen in projection toward ctb 37a ( and distinct from the extended emission with a hard spectrum seen toward the northwest rim of the snr ) and suggest that it may be a neutron star associated with this snr .",
    "\\3 ) we have discussed the plasma conditions of the four x - ray detected snrs and estimated such properties of the plasma as @xmath4@xmath5 , @xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath9 : these values range from @xmath30.4 - 0.8 @xmath50 , @xmath32.3 - 4.2@xmath2910@xmath108 yr and @xmath313 - 88 @xmath8@xmath110 , respectively .",
    "these values are similar to those observed for other mm snrs .",
    "\\4 ) we discuss the implications of our results for studies of snr evolution . because all four of the x - ray detected snrs feature lines produced by shocked @xmath121@xmath18 in their infrared spectra , we argue that each of them is interacting with a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "we believe that our results help strengthen the link between mm snrs and interactions between snrs and molecular clouds : this may help to explain the origin of the center - filled thermal x - ray morphologies of these sources .",

    "<S> we argue that these snrs should be classified as mixed - morphology snrs ( mm snrs ) : our study strengthens the correlation between mm snrs and snrs interacting with molecular clouds and suggests that the origin of mixed - morphology snrs may be due to the interactions between these snrs and adjacent clouds . </S>",
