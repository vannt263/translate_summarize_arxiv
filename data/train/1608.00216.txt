    "weak gibbs measures are conformal probability measures obtained as eigenvectors of ruelle - perron - frobenius operators associated with continuous potentials on topological dynamical systems . when the system @xmath3 has nice enough geometric properties , for instance in the case of a conformal repeller , these measures provide natural , and now standard examples of measures obeying the multifractal formalism : their hausdorff spectrum and @xmath4-spectrum form a legendre pair .",
    "specifically , for such a measure @xmath5 on @xmath3 , the ( lower ) @xmath4-spectrum @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7 where the supremum is taken over all families of disjoint closed balls @xmath8 of radius @xmath9 with centers in @xmath10 ; the hausdorff spectrum of @xmath5 is defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the hausdorff dimension , @xmath13 with @xmath14 and we have the duality relation @xmath15 a negative dimension meaning that the set is empty .",
    "in fact , due to the super and submultiplicativity properties associated with @xmath5 , the same equality holds if we replace the limit by a @xmath16 or a @xmath17 in the definition of the local dimension .",
    "the rigorous study of these measures started with the gibbs measures case , which corresponds to hlder continuous potentials , or continuous potentials possessing the so - called bounded distorsions property , and in particular on the so - called `` cookie - cutter '' cantor sets associated with a @xmath18 expanding map @xmath19 on the line @xcite ( see @xcite for an extended discussion of dimension theory and multifractal analysis for hyperbolic conformal dynamical systems ) .",
    "this followed seminal works by physicists of turbulence and statistical mechanics pointing the accuracy of multifractals to statistically and geometrically describe the local behavior of functions and measures @xcite . in the case of gibbs measures ,",
    "the @xmath4-spectrum of the gibbs measure is differentiable , and analytic if the potential @xmath20 is hlder continuous ; it is the unique solution @xmath21 of the equation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands for the topological pressure .",
    "the general case of continuous potentials was solved later in @xcite , with the same formula for the @xmath4-spectrum .",
    "these progress then led to the multifractal analysis of bernoulli convolutions associated with pisot numbers @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic formalism and large deviations are central tool in these studies .    in the context of random dynamical systems ,",
    "the multifractal analysis of random gibbs measures ( to be defined below ) associated with random hlder continuous potentials on attractors of random @xmath18 expanding ( or expanding in the mean ) random conformal dynamics encoded by random subshifs of finite type has been studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these works , as well as the dimension theory of attractors of random dynamics @xcite , are based on the thermodynamic formalism for random transforms @xcite .",
    "the multifractal analysis of random weak gibbs measures is also implicitly considered in @xcite ( which deals with the multifractal analysis of birkhoff averages ) , but the fibers are deterministic , and the techniques developed there seems difficult to adapt in a simple way in the case of random subshifts .    in this paper",
    "we consider , on a base probability space @xmath24 , random weak gibbs measures on some class of attractors included in @xmath25 $ ] and associated with @xmath0 random dynamics semi - conjugate ( up to countably many points ) , or conjugate , to a random subshift of finite type .",
    "we provide a study of the multifractal nature of these measures , including the validity of the multifractal formalism , the calculation of hausdorff and packing dimensions of the so - called level sets of divergent points , and a @xmath1-@xmath2 law for the hausdorff and packing measures of the level sets of the local dimension .",
    "compared to the above mentioned works , apart the source of new difficulties coming from the relaxation of the regularity properties of the potentials , our assumptions provide a more general process of construction of the random cantor set in terms of the distribution of the random family of intervals used to refine the construction at a given step : it can contain contiguous intervals ( i.e. without gap in between , and even no gap ) with positive probability ; thus , for instance , it covers the natural families of cantor sets one can obtain by picking at random a fiber in a bedford - mcmullen carpet .",
    "extensions of our results to the higher dimensional case will be discussed in remark  [ higherdim ] .",
    "we focus on the one dimensional case because our model will be used in a companion paper to study the multifractal nature of discrete measures obtained as `` inverse '' of the random weak gibbs measures considered here .",
    "section 2 developes background about random dynamical systems and thermodynamic formalism , and presents our main results , namely theorems  [ multifractal initial ] and  [ multifractal initial2 ] , as well as concrete examples of random attractors .",
    "section 3 provides the basic properties that will used in the proof of this theorem in section 4 .",
    "we first need to expose basic facts from random dynamical systems and thermodynamic formalism .",
