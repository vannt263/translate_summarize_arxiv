    "one of the most amazing areas in the northern , winter sky is orion and its myriads of star forming regions ( sfr ) .",
    "one of the most prominent , albeit not very well studied , is the sfr dominated by the o8 iii star @xmath2@xmath3 ori , the lambda orionis sfr ( losfr ) . among other structures , it includes a co and a dust ring whose diameter is about nine deg , the s264 hii region , a large number of iras sources , the barnard 30 and 35 dark clouds and a cluster associated with the central star , the lambda ori cluster ( collinder 69 ) . as a laboratory for the star formation process ( or processes ) , the losfr represents a unique environment due to its diversity , its proximity ( 400 pc ) , its age range ( @xmath45 myr ) and low extinction in the internal area of the ring ( a@xmath5=0.37 ) . prior to our study ,",
    "several groups have published studies focused on different aspects of the sfr , such as the initial discovery by wade ( 1957 ) , the photometric properties of the high mass members by murdin & penston ( 1977 ; hereafter m&p77 ) , a h@xmath6 survey by duerr , imhoff & lada ( 1982 ) , the analysis of the iras data ( zhang et al . 1989 ) and the photometric and spectroscopic search by dolan & mathieu ( 1999 , 2001 , 2002 ; hereafter d&m ) .",
    "this last set of studies reached i@xmath7=14.5 , about 0.5 m@xmath1 .",
    "our aim is to carry out a comprehensive study in the losfr , reaching well below the hydrogen burning limit ( hbl , the substellar border line at @xmath40.072 m@xmath1 , as derived by the lyon models , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) . here",
    ", we present some initial results mainly concerning the central area of this fascinating sfr .",
    "the star cluster associated with the star @xmath2 orionis is clearly identified in figure 1 by the overdensity of b stars ( four point stars ) . in order to identify low mass members of this association ,",
    "we have conducted several photometric and spectroscopic campaigns , both in the optical and the near infrared .",
    "details regarding the first of them , an optical search figure 2 with the cfht and the 12k mosaic , supplemented with 2mass jhk data and spectroscopy from keck and magellan , can be found in barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 2004 , paper i ) .",
    "note that for a 5 myr age , and based on nextgen and cond ( chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ) models , the hydrogen and deuterium burning limits are located at i@xmath7=17.6 and i@xmath7=22 , i.e. , we have sampled the complete brown dwarf domain .",
    "based on this wealth of data , we have found 170 candidate members in the range i@xmath7=12.522.0 , which translate to 1.20.01 m@xmath1 for bona fide members . of these 170",
    ", 33 have been spectroscopically observe at low - resolution ( i@xmath7=15.220.7 , m4.5m8.5 spectral types ) , whereas another 25 have medium resolution spectra ( i@xmath7=13.717.6 , m4m6.0 ) .",
    "the analysis of the optical - ir information see color - magnitude and color - color diagrams in paper i indicates that the pollution rate should be about 30% .",
    "a similar value is derived from the spectroscopy .",
    "we have also studied other properties of the low mass stellar and substellar population of the lambda orionis cluster coll  69 and compare those properties with previous results from the losfr and other young associations . in particular , we have measured the strength of the lithium doublet at 6708  ( see palla & randich , this volume ) and h@xmath6 , another signpost of youth and accretion .",
    "our targets show lithium in their medium - resolution spectra , clearly indicating that they are pms objects . on the other hand , by comparison with the criterion for h@xmath6 defined in barrado y navascus & martn ( 2003 )",
    ", we find that coll  69 has a paucity of ctt stars compared with the clusters associated with the dark clouds barnard 30 and 35 ( as already noted by d&m ) .",
    "this might be related to the obvious richness of hot , high mass stars in the first association , compared with the other two , as is easily appreciated in figure 1 .",
    "d&m suggested a scenario to explain these differences , with the episodes of star formation in b30 and b35 ( and eventually in the ring in the losfr ) triggered by a supernova in coll  69 .",
    "this catastrophic event is speculated to have removed most of the disk material around the young stars in coll  69 .",
    "if this scenario is true , coll  69 should be older than the other two clusters , and have a different history of star formation - possibly leading to a different imf .",
    "we have derived a luminosity and initial mass functions ( lf and imf ) for the bona fide members of coll  69 .",
    "we emphasize that our imf characterize only the central part of the cluster . for more massive stars , we used data from d&m and m&p77 , scaling the areas in the appropriate way .",
    "regarding the lf ( figure 3a ) , the solid and dashed lines were computed including all possible members ( solid line ) and removing the photometric binaries ( possible members , dashed line ) , respectively .    the imf is displayed in figure 3b . in order to extend the imf to the high mass domain , we have included data from m&p97 .",
    "we have faced three important problems : the in - homogeneity of the photometric data ( we have derived bolometric magnitudes from @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , the paucity of massive stars i.e . , the validity of the lf in that range and the selecting of a theoretical models .",
    "we have used models by girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) and baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , for massive , intermediate and low mass objects ( dashed , dotted and solid lines ) , respectively .",
    "the dip at about 2 m@xmath1 is due to incompleteness in the sample .",
    "the last point ( open triangle ) at the massive end correspond to the possible sn .",
    "note that the binning in the lf is arbitrary , although the results do not change much by selecting other values .",
    "the slopes of the imf ( bold , dashed segments ) are @xmath6=2.27@xmath10 , and @xmath6=0.73@xmath110.05 , for the mass ranges 250.70 and 0.70 - 0.02 m@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the figure indicates that the sn hypothesis is compatible with the imf of the cluster . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this imf is one of the most complete and accurate due to the reduced internal reddening of the cluster imf published in the literature , covering more than three orders of magnitude in mass ."
