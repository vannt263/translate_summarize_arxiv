    "in statistical physics , any large - scale universal behavior is expected to come from some underlying renormalization ( rg ) procedure that eliminates all the details of microscopic models . in the presence of quenched disorder ,",
    "interesting universal scaling behaviors occur both at phase transitions ( as in pure systems ) but also in the low - temperature disorder - dominated phases . since the main property of frozen disorder is to break the translational invariance , the most natural renormalization procedures that allow to describe spatial heterogeneities are a priori real - space rg procedures . among real - space renormalization procedures that have been introduced for pure systems @xcite , migdal - kadanoff block renormalizations",
    "@xcite play a special role , because they can be considered either as approximate renormalization procedures on hypercubic lattices , or as exact renormalization procedures on certain hierarchical lattices @xcite .",
    "they have thus been used to study various disordered models , such as the diluted ising model @xcite , ferromagnetic random potts model @xcite and spin - glasses @xcite . for the case of spin - glasses , the main output of these migdal - kadanoff rg studies is that the probability distribution @xmath0 of the effective coupling @xmath1 on scale @xmath2 satisfies a closed rg equation whose solution flows towards a fixed shape with a scale - dependent width @xmath3 that defines the droplet exponent @xmath4 . to adapt this idea to hypercubic lattices ,",
    "the notion of domain - wall rg has been developed @xcite , where the droplet exponent @xmath4 is defined via the change of the free - energy of a given sample when periodic boundary conditions are replaced by antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "this definition can be used numerically in dimensions @xmath5 to obtain a fixed shape for the probability distribution of this free - energy difference when rescaled by @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although this result is expected to come from some underlying rg procedure , we are not aware of an explicit principle to define a real - space rg procedure for this distribution for hypercubic lattices ( apart from the migdal - kadanoff approximation that actually replaces the hypercubic lattice by a hierarchical lattice ) . because of the difficulties to formulate an appropriate coarse - graining in real space ( see the discussion in section vi of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , fisher and huse @xcite have preferred to formulate their droplet scaling theory as a scaling ansatz for the nature , statistics , energetics and dynamics of the low - lying large scale excitations [ ... ] using rg ideas only to justify our scaling assumptions.    the aim of the present paper is to show that the universal scaling behaviors that appear in the low - temperature disorder - dominated phases of disordered systems can be understood within an explicit and consistent rg procedure _ in configuration space_. we adopt here the broken ergodicity point of view @xcite ( see more details in section [ bepalmer ] ) , so that the aim of the rg procedure is to construct the valleys of configurations that are separated by large barriers . to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of disordered systems",
    ", we have recently introduced a strong disorder rg procedure to characterize the statistics of barriers on various scales and the extremely - slow logarithmic growth of the coherence length @xmath6 @xcite . in the present paper , we show how this method can be used to construct the valleys that are separated by barriers above a given threshold and to study their statistical properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ coarsegrained ] , we briefly recalled the broken ergodicity point of view and explain how a coarse - grained dynamics between valleys allows to obtain their free - energy differences . in section [ full ] , we describe the explicit strong - disorder rg rules for random master equations and discuss the properties of the valleys that emerge .",
    "in particular , we explain how the free - energy differences between valleys is constrained by a conservation law for ratios of renormalized transition rates along the rg flow . in section",
    "[ simplified ] , we describe the simplified rg rules that are valid at large scales near infinite disorder fixed points , and that correspond to the notion of quasi - equilibrium inside each valley .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the statistical physics of equilibrium is based on boltzmann s ergodic principle , that states the equivalence between the time average of any observable @xmath7 over a sufficiently long time @xmath8 by an ensemble average over microscopic configurations @xmath9 of energies @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the boltzmann measure at temperature @xmath13 @xmath14 and where @xmath15 is the partition function @xmath16 even if historically and physically , this dynamical interpretation of the equilibrium is crucial , it is sometimes a bit forgotten. in particular to discuss the appearance of low temperature symmetry broken phases in pure systems such as ferromagnets , it has become usual to reason only _ statically _ in terms of the properties of the boltzmann measure in the thermodynamic limit , but this way of thinking usually involves some cheating , in the sense that one adds an infinitesimal magnetic external field , or some special boundary conditions for the spins to select the possible pure states that are obvious from the very beginning . for disordered systems , many discussions of the equilibrium are based on the same purely static way of thinking , but they face the very essential problem that whenever disorder induces some frustration , the possible pure states are not at all obvious because they depend on the realization of the randomness . in particular for spin - glasses",
    "( see the reviews @xcite ) which constitute the most studied frustrated disordered system , there exists a long - standing controversy on the nature and the number of pure states , as well as on the definition of appropriate order parameters .",
    "the main descriptions are the mean - field - inspired replica - symmetry - breaking point of view @xcite , the renormalization - inspired droplet scaling picture @xcite , the more recent numerically - inspired trival - non trivial @xcite and state hierarchy of correlated spin domains @xcite descriptions . as a consequence ,",
    "a purely static definition of pure states based on the infinite - volume limit of finite - volume boltzmann measures which is simple for ferromagnets when the answer is known in advance , turns out to become very subtle for frustrated disordered systems where the number and the nature of pure states are not known in advance ( see for instance the discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "we thus feel that for such systems , a much clearer physical description can be achieved by returning to the historical point of view of statistical mechanics where the equilibrium is considered as the stationary measure of some _ dynamics _ , so that the question on the number of phases for the equilibrium becomes a question of ergodicity - breaking for the dynamics : are there valleys in configuration space that become separated by diverging barriers in the thermodynamic limit and that keep nevertheless finite free - energy differences ?",
    "this broken - ergodicity point of view is actually also the historical point of view for the spin - glass problem : in their original paper @xcite , edwards and anderson have defined their order parameter by the following sentence : `` if on one observation a particular spin is @xmath17 , then if it is studied again a long time later , there is a non - vanishing probability that @xmath18 will point in the same direction '' .",
    "the importance of this definition has been further emphasized by anderson in @xcite : `` if the spins are going to polarize in a particular random function [ ... ] , we had better not try to characterize the order by some kind of long - ranged order in space , or by some kind of order parameter defined in space , but _ we must approach it from a pure non - ergodic point of view , as a long - range order in the time alone _ : if the system has a certain order at @xmath19 , then as @xmath20 there remain a finite memory of that order '' @xmath21 many works have then tried to characterize the phase space structure of spin - glasses via dynamical studies , in particular by measuring numerically the distance between two configurations that are submitted to the same thermal noise to detect the presence of different valleys that become separated by diverging barriers in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "since the works on spin - glasses that are based on a dynamical point of view of the equilibrium are too numerous to be summarized here , we will stop here this reminder , and we refer the reader to the papers of palmer where the issues related to broken ergodicity are discussed in detail , both for statistical physics models in general @xcite and for spin - glasses in particular @xcite . once one has adopted this broken ergodicity point of view , the aim is to construct the valleys that tend to confine the dynamics in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the starting point is thus some microscopic dynamics in phase space .      in statistical physics",

    "in the present section , we explained why the strong disordered renormalization of master equation introduced in @xcite is the appropriate way to construct the coarse - grained dynamics between valleys starting from the microscopic master equation .",
    "strong disorder renormalization ( see @xcite for a review ) is a very specific type of rg that has been first developed in the field of quantum spins : the rg rules of ma and dasgupta @xcite have been put on a firm ground by d.s .",
    "fisher who introduced the crucial idea of `` infinite disorder '' fixed point where the method becomes asymptotically exact , and who computed explicitly exact critical exponents and scaling functions for one - dimensional disordered quantum spin chains @xcite .",

    "the validity of this approximation within the present framework will be discussed in detail below in [ strongdisorderfixedpoint ] .",

    "this point is very important to understand the meaning of the renormalization procedure : the remaining configurations at a given renormalization scale are formally microscopic configurations of the initial master equation ( eq . [ master ] ) , but each of these remaining microscopic configuration actually represents some valley in configuration space that takes into account all the previously decimated configurations .",
    "\\(4 ) return to point ( 1 ) .",
    "note that in practice , the renormalized rates @xmath69 can rapidly become very small as a consequence of the multiplicative structure of the renormalization rule of eq [ wijnew ] .",
    "this means that the appropriate variables are the logarithms of the transition rates , that we will call barriers in the remaining of this paper .",
    "the barrier @xmath70 from @xmath71 to @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 and similarly the exit barrier out of configuration @xmath71 is defined by @xmath74 note that a very important advantage of this formulation in terms of the renormalized transition rates of the master equation is that the renormalized barriers take into account the true barriers of the dynamics , whatever their origin which can be either energetic or entropic .      as mentioned above , the approximation made in the renormalization rule of eq .",
    "[ wijnew ] consists in neglecting the time spent in the decimated configuration @xmath47 with respect to the other time scales remaining in the system . in the present framework , this means that the maximal exit rate chosen in eq [ defwmax ] should be well separated from the exit rates of the neighboring configurations @xmath53 .",
    "the crucial idea of infinite disorder fixed point @xcite is that even if this approximation is not perfect during the first steps of the renormalization , this approximation will become better and better at large time scale if the probability distribution of the remaining exit rates becomes broader and broader upon iteration .",
    "more precisely , if the renormalization scale @xmath75 is defined as the exit barrier of the last decimated configuration @xmath76 @xmath77 one expects that the probability distribution of the remaining exit barrier @xmath78 will converge towards some scaling form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the fixed point probability distribution , and where @xmath81 is the appropriate scaling factor for the width .",
    "the notion of infinite disorder fixed point means that the width @xmath81 grows indefinitely with the renormalization scale @xmath75 @xmath82 whenever this infinite disorder fixed point condition is satisfied , the strong disorder renormalization procedure becomes asymptotically exact at large scales . in previously known cases of infinite disorder fixed points where",
    "calculations can be done explicitly @xcite , the scale @xmath81 has been found to grow linearly @xmath83 .",
    "this behavior means that the cut - off @xmath75 is the only characteristic scale and thus describes some critical point @xcite . for the present procedure concerning the dynamics in disordered models",
    ", this property means some criticality in the time direction , i.e. the absence of any characteristic time scale between the microscopic scale and the macroscopic equilibrium time of the full disordered sample ( see @xcite for more detailed discussions ) .",
    "for the present strong disorder renormalization of a master equation , the convergence towards an infinite disorder fixed point will depend on the initial condition of the transition rates , i.e. on the model ( and on the temperature if there are phase transitions ) .",
    "however , the form of the rg rules of eq [ wijnew ] is sufficiently similar to the usual ma - dasgupta rules @xcite to think that the convergence towards some infinite disorder fixed point should be realized in a very broad class of disordered systems in their glassy phase . in practice",
    ", it should be checked numerically for each model of interest .",
    "we refer to @xcite where this scenario has been checked numerically for the dynamics of a directed polymer in a two dimensional random medium .",
    "we have explained above how the free - energy difference between two valleys can be obtained from the ratio of the two transition rates between them ( eq . [ freediffwr ] ) .",
    "it is thus convenient to introduce the following notation for these ratios @xmath84 to see how they evolve upon renormalization . in the initial condition ( rg scale @xmath85 ) corresponding to the microscopic master equation of eq .",
    "[ master ] , the values of all these ratios are fixed by the detailed balance condition of eq [ detailedbalance ] @xmath86 in terms of the energies @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the microscopic configurations @xmath89 .    from the full rg rules of eqs [ wijnew ] and [ picstar ] , we obtain the following rg rule for the ratio @xmath90 r   \\left ( { c}_i   \\to { c}_j \\right ) + \\left [ w ( { c}_j \\to { c}^ * ) w \\left ( { c}^ *   \\to { c}_i \\right ) \\right ] r ( { c}_i \\to { c}^ * ) r \\left ( { c}^ *   \\to { c}_j \\right ) } { \\left [ w_{out } \\left ( { c}^*\\right ) w   \\left ( { c}_j   \\to { c}_i \\right)\\right ] + \\left [ w ( { c}_j \\to { c}^ * ) w \\left ( { c}^ *   \\to { c}_i \\right ) \\right ] } \\nonumber   \\label{ratiorg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us first consider the first rg step : since the initial value of eq .",
    "[ ratioinitial ] has actually a factorized form , one obtains that the product of the second term in the numerator is simply @xmath91 . as a consequence in eq .",
    "[ ratiorg ] , the factor @xmath92 can be factorized and what remains in the numerator is exactly equal to the denominator .",
    "this simplification is actually valid at all steps of the rg procedure by recurrence .",
    "we thus obtained that the ratios @xmath93 are actually conserved by the rg flow in the following sense @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the microscopic configurations that label the renormalized valleys @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "since the free - energy difference between two valleys can be obtained from the ratio of the two transition rates between them ( eq . [ freediffwr ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath99 i.e. the free - energy difference between the two renormalized valleys @xmath97 and @xmath98 is simply given by the difference of energy of the two microscopic configurations @xmath95 and @xmath96 that label the renormalized valleys .",
    "this property indicates that the statistics of free - energy differences between renormalized valleys is the same as the statistics of energy differences between good microscopic configurations .",
    "this property is usually assumed within the droplet scaling picture @xcite where the low - temperature phase is expected to be governed by a zero - temperature fixed point . within the strong disorder rg procedure ,",
    "this property emerges as a consequence of a conservation law for the ratio @xmath93 of the transition rates between two renormalized configurations .    as a final remark",
    ", we should stress here that this conservation law does not mean that the free - energy differences remain the same as the temperature @xmath100 varies , because the valleys @xmath97 and @xmath98 that survive during the rg procedure are temperature - dependent , i.e. the microscopic configurations @xmath95 and @xmath96 that label the longest - lived renormalized valleys will change with the temperature . within our present rg framework , the chaos properties with respect to temperature changes , that are expected within the droplet scaling theory @xcite , should correspond to the sensitivity of the rg flow with respect to changes in the initial condition , as in migdal - kadanoff real - space rg procedures ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however a detailed study of these chaos properties for the present strong disorder procedure goes beyond the present work and these effects will not be discussed further here .",
    "as explained in @xcite where the rule of eq .",
    "[ wijnew ] has been proposed to eliminate fast states in dynamical problems with two very separated time scales , the prescription to obtain the new transition rates actually corresponds to an adiabatic approximation. let us explain this point within our present notations since it has important consequences for the present the coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the idea of the adiabatic approximation @xcite is that fast degrees of freedom adapt rapidly to ensure that the probability flow entering into them is exactly compensated by the probability flow emerging from them .",
    "within our present notation where the fast state is the configuration @xmath64 , the probability flow entering into @xmath64 from its neighbors @xmath101 reads @xmath102 whereas the probability flow emerging from @xmath64 reads @xmath103 the adiabatic approximation consists in assuming that on time scales much larger than the typical relaxation time @xmath104 of @xmath64 , the occupation probability @xmath105 adapts to ensure the global zero - flow condition @xmath106 leading to @xmath107 i.e. the occupation probability @xmath105 of the fast configuration @xmath64 now only varies slowly in time by following the external slow inputs @xmath108 given by the slow configurations @xmath29 that are connected to it .",
    "physically , this means that the fast configuration @xmath64 is equilibrated as much as it can in the out - of - equilibrium environment produced by the slow configurations .",
    "the equivalence of this way of thinking with the renormalization rule of eq [ wijnew ] is immediate by replacing the value of eq .",

    "as emphasized in @xcite , the adiabatic interpretation shows that even if one eliminates the fast modes to obtain the effective dynamics of slow modes , the information on the fast modes is actually not completely lost since its slow variation in time can be reconstructed via eq .",
    "[ probaadiabatique ] from the dynamics of the slow modes .",
    "moreover , this point of view allows to derive how the decimated valley @xmath64 contributes to modify the energies of the neighboring renormalized valleys .",
    "equation [ probaadiabatique ] can be interpreted as follows : after the elimination of @xmath64 , when the system is in the renormalized configuration @xmath97 , it is actually in the decimated configuration @xmath64 with a temporal weight @xmath111 . as a consequence , the appropriate rg rule for the energies of the neighboring valleys",
    "@xmath97 upon the elimination of the configuration @xmath64 reads @xmath112 more generally , one may write similar rg equations for observables that are linear in the probabilities @xmath113 , but not for the entropy which involves logarithms .",
    "( the definition of intra - valleys entropies will be possible only with the simplified rg rules discussed in section [ simplified ] ) .",
    "the interpretation in terms of an adiabatic approximation allows also to understand the effects of bad decimations , defined as the cases where the exit rate out of @xmath64 is not very well separated from the exit rates out of its neighbors .",
    "as explained in @xcite , there exists some commutativity of the rg rules in the following sense : the order of elimination of the fast states is not important anymore when all the fast states have been decimated .",
    "the reason is that in the adiabatic approximation , one may eliminates all the fast states simultaneously by requiring that all the corresponding probability currents vanish simultaneously .",
    "the solution of this linear system is unique and the rg procedure simply corresponds to solve this system by substitution in a given order , but any other order would have given the same unique solution .",
    "this shows that when there are only two very different time scales as in @xcite , all fast states can actually be eliminated at once .",
    "but in our present framework for disordered systems where a broad distribution of time scales exist , from the microscopic time scale of a single move to the equilibrium time of the whole system , it is not obvious at the beginning which set of microscopic configurations should be eliminated to obtain a consistent set of renormalized valleys whose exit rates is above some prescribed threshold . as a consequence , the iterative rg procedure that renormalizes the exit rates out of the surviving configurations is actually essential to determine which are the longest - lived renormalized valleys in each sample . nevertheless , the commutativity property is important , since it shows that bad decimations will actually be corrected in the later stages of the renormalization when the neighbors will themselves be decimated .",
    "this phenomenon is very reminiscent of what has been found by d.s .",
    "fisher for quantum spin chains in appendix e of @xcite dedicated to the effects of a bad decimation :  we recover exactly at a later stage from the errors made earlier. this property explains why strong disorder rg methods are usually much more accurate than one might think from the approximations involved in the first stages of the rg procedure where the probability distributions are not yet broad enough .",
    "the final picture is that at large rg scale @xmath75 , where the probability distributions are broad enough to ensure a separation of scales between the decimated configuration and its neighbors : ( i ) the present errors are small and of order @xmath114 ( ii ) the past errors due to the first stages of the rg procedure have been cured by later decimations .",

    "\\(4 ) return to ( 1 )    as explained in @xcite , these simplified rg rules are interesting both from a computational point of view ( they allow to study bigger system sizes ) and from a theoretical point of view to make the link with the idea of internal ergodicity in each valley @xcite as we now explain .      in the studies on slowly relaxing systems such as disordered systems , glasses or granular media , it is usual to separate the dynamics into two parts : there are ` fast ' degrees of freedom which rapidly reach local quasi - equilibrium plus a slow non - equilibrium part . within the present strong disorder renormalization in configuration space",
    ", these ideas can be applied directly as follows .",
    "to each time @xmath8 , one may associate a set of valleys which are labelled by the surviving configurations at the rg scale @xmath162 . since at large scale , the rg flow for the barrier distribution is towards some `` infinite disorder '' fixed point , the different time scales are effectively very well separated . and",
    "thus asymptotically we recover the palmer s decomposition into components from which the escape probability is small and in which there is internal ergodicity , i.e. the interior of each valley has been able to equilibrate @xcite .",
    "moreover , the slow non - equilibrium part of the dynamics corresponds to the evolution of the renormalized valleys with the rg scale : some valleys disappear and are absorbed by a neighboring valley . here",
    "again , we see that the rg procedure corresponds asymptotically to palmer bifurcation cascade of components : see figure 4 of @xcite where the bifurcation cascade is drawn as a function of temperature for a fixed time . in our present framework , it is better to represent this bifurcation cascade as a function of time for fixed temperature .",
    "this is because it has been understood since the papers of palmer @xcite that disordered systems have some chaos property with respect to temperature changes , i.e. the valleys that will emerge at large scales for different temperatures are not simply related ( for more details on these chaos properties , see @xcite ) .",
    "to finish this discussion , we would like to emphasize a very important point : the asymptotic dominance of the preferred exit channel near the infinite disorder fixed point is actually crucial to obtain quasi - equilibrium inside valleys . in particular ,",
    "if the degeneracy between the second preferred exit channel and the first preferred exit channel could occur with a finite probability , then finite contributions of out - of - equilibrium situations at all scales would ruin the quasi - equilibrium approximation : the probability to be in a configuration @xmath71 at time @xmath8 would not depend only on its energy @xmath163 and on the partition function of the renormalized valley it belongs to , but would be instead a very complicated function of all possible paths from @xmath164 to @xmath165 with their appropriate dynamical weights . to better understand the importance of this discussion ,",
    "it is useful to recall here a well - identified exception of the quasi - equilibrium idea , namely the symmetric bouchaud s trap model in one dimension , where even in the limit of arbitrary low temperature , the diffusion front in each sample consists in two delta peaks , which are completely out of equilibrium with each other @xcite : the weights of these two delta peaks do not depend on their energies , but instead on the distances to the origin that determine the probability to reach one before the other ( see @xcite for more details ) . in this trap model ,",
    "the reason is clear : whenever the particle escapes from a trap , it jumps either to the right or to the left with equal probabilities @xmath166 , i.e. the two possible exit channels are degenerate by the very definition of the model that imposes this symmetry . in other disordered models where this degeneracy is not imposed by a symmetry of the model , this degeneracy can only occur accidentally with some probability .",
    "the question is then whether this probability of accidental degeneracy between the two preferred exit channels remains finite or becomes rare ( i.e. decays to zero ) at large times . within the present strong disorder rg where the flow is towards some infinite disorder fixed point",
    ", the dominance of the preferred exit channel precisely means that the probability of these accidental degeneracy decays to zero , so that the quasi - equilibrium approximation becomes asymptotically exact at large times .",
    "( as discussed in detail in @xcite for the case of the sinai model and in @xcite for our present rg procedure in configuration space , the rare events where the quasi - equilibrium approximation breaks down occur with a vanishing probability of order @xmath167 at large times . )",
    "the property of quasi - equilibrium inside each valley discussed above allows to write rg rules for the intra - valley energies and entropies as we now explain . within the simplified rg rules where the preferred exit channel @xmath168 out of the decimated configuration @xmath64 actually dominates",
