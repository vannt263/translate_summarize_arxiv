    "<S> we consider a one - dimensional gas of cold atoms with strong contact interactions and construct an effective spin - chain hamiltonian for a two - component system . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting heisenberg spin model can be engineered by manipulating the shape of the external confining potential of the atomic gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find that bosonic atoms offer more flexibility for tuning independently the parameters of the spin hamiltonian through interatomic ( intra - species ) interaction which is absent for fermions due to the pauli exclusion principle . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism can have important implications for control and manipulation of the dynamics of few- and many - body quantum systems ; as an illustrative example relevant to quantum computation and communication , we consider state transfer in the simplest non - trivial system of four particles representing exchange - coupled qubits . </S>"
