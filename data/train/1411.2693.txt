    "the scaling of @xmath191 is akin to the _ mean magnetic field renormalization _ in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in which the random mean magnetic field @xmath192 , substitution of which in kraichnan s spectrum for the mhd turbulence yields @xmath193^{1/2 } k^{-3/2 } = \\pi^{2/3 } k^{-5/3},\\ ] ] which is the kolmogorov s spectrum for strong mhd turbulence ( also see zhou _ et al . _",
    "a detailed field - theoretic computation of @xmath191 scaling is desirable in view of the above result .",
    "thus , we show that the random mean velocity field @xmath14 could yield @xmath194 spectrum in the weak turbulence limit in which the length scale of the velocity fluctuations are much smaller than that of @xmath14 .",
    "however , in the strong turbulence limit , @xmath14 is scale - dependent with @xmath195 , and it yields kolmogorov s energy spectrum .",
    "hence , the large - scale random velocity sweeps the velocity fluctuations , and it could yield both @xmath194 and @xmath8 energy spectra depending on the scale separation between @xmath14 and the velocity fluctuations .",
    "in this paper we address the sweeping effect in fluid turbulence in the eulerian picture .",
    "we show that for a constant mean velocity field @xmath102 , the properties of turbulence independent of @xmath102 , namely that the renormalized or effective viscosity @xmath80 and the energy spectrum @xmath196 for any @xmath102 .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the velocity field however contains signature of @xmath102 , and it exhibits damped oscillation with a time period of @xmath197 and a decay rate of @xmath198 .",
    "the decay rate or @xmath199 is independent of @xmath14 , which is a statement of the galilean invariance of the renormalized turbulent viscosity .",
    "we exploit the independence of @xmath1 with @xmath102 to validate our theoretical predictions using numerical simulations .",
    "we find a very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and numerical results .",
    "the above computations resolve the concerns raised by kraichnan  @xcite .",
    "the difference between our results and those of kraichnan is due to the random mean velocity field @xmath102 used by kraichnan . in sec .",
    "[ sec : random_galilean ] of the present paper , we follow the dia computation of kraichnan  @xcite but with a small modification .",
    "we replace the @xmath200 term of the navier stokes equation with @xmath168 with an interpretation that @xmath14 represents the velocity of the large - scale structures oriented in random directions . in the weak turbulence limit ,",
    "the above dynamics yields @xmath194 energy spectrum , which is same as kraichnan s result .",
    "it is not surprising since the aforementioned computation is the same as kraichnan  @xcite .",
    "the scale separation assumed in the weak turbulence limit does not hold for fully - developed turbulence .",
    "for this case , the dimensional counting of dia s green s function and correlation function indicates that @xmath14 is @xmath132-dependent with @xmath195 that yields kolmogorov s energy spectrum .",
    "physically , the large - scale eddies sweep the small - scale eddies , but the velocity of the large - scale eddies scales as @xmath201 . in the inertial range , the above scaling holds at all levels .",
    "the aforementioned dia results for random @xmath14 shows that we can obtain both @xmath8 and @xmath194 energy spectra depending on the scale separation ( strong turbulence and weak turbulence respectively )",
    ". thus we demonstrate agreement between  random galilean invariance \" , strong vs. weak turbulence , and the kolmgorov s spectrum .",
    "we however remark that the @xmath195 computation needs to be demonstrated explicitly in similar lines as verma  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a variation of dia captures the sweeping effect due to the random large - scale structures .",
    "our results show that eulerian picture is suitable for field - theoretic computation of fluid turbulence , and it yields kolmogorov s energy spectrum .",
    "earlier mccomb and coworkers  @xcite , yakhot and orszag  @xcite , and zhou and coworkers  @xcite employed renormalization group technique in eulerian formalism , and obtained consistent results .",
    "however , none of the aforementioned work explicitly showed invariance of the renormalization group procedure with @xmath0 , as done in our present paper .    based on the renormalization group analysis of navier stokes equation in the eulerian framework , yakhot  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that the rms value of the mean velocity field @xmath202 , when @xmath203 is the rg expansion parameter . therefore @xmath7 is negligible when @xmath204 .",
    "note however that yakhot  _ et al .",
    "_ s arguments too are based on random mean velocity field @xmath7 , not on the constant mean velocity field , as envisaged in galilean invariance .",
    "also , yakhot and orszag s rg computation  @xcite yield kolmogorov s spectrum for @xmath205 , hence the limit @xmath204 employed to @xmath202 is inconsistent with kolmogorov s spectrum .",
    "sreenivasan and stolovitzky  @xcite analysed the velocity fluctuations of the atmospheric data and showed that the conditional expectation of @xmath206 depends on the _ local mean velocity field _",
    "@xmath207 for small reynolds number @xmath208 , but it is independent of @xmath207 for large reynolds number .",
    "here @xmath209 , where @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively , are the velocity component and the separation distance in the direction @xmath212 .",
    "we could possibly argue that for large @xmath208 , @xmath206 may be independent of @xmath207 due to large scale separation between the scales of @xmath207 and @xmath211 .",
    "however , for small @xmath208 , the large - scale velocity fluctuation @xmath14 could affect @xmath206 since their scales are not well separated .",
    "we need further investigation to relate the renormalized local mean velocity field @xmath191 with @xmath206 that may provide insights into the experimental results of sreenivasan and stolovitzky  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "a constant mean velocity field does not change the properties of turbulence .",
    "but large - scale random velocity field sweeps the structures within the flow , and it could lead to @xmath8 or @xmath194 energy spectrum depending on the whether the turbulence is weak or strong .",
