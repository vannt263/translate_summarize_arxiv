    "<S> in this work we study the formation and dynamics of polarons in a system with a few impurities in a lattice immersed in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> this system has been experimentally realized using ultracold atoms and optical lattices . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a two - band model for the impurity atoms , along with a bogoliubov approximation for the bec , with phonons coupled to impurities via both intraband and interband transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we decouple this frhlich - type term by an extended two - band lang - firsov polaron transformation using a variational method . </S>",
    "<S> the new effective hamiltonian with two ( polaron ) bands differs from the original hamiltonian by modified coherent transport , polaron energy shifts , and induced long - range interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a lindblad master - equation approach is used to take into account residual incoherent coupling between polaron and bath . </S>",
    "<S> this polaronic treatment yields a renormalized inter - band relaxation rate compared to fermi s golden rule . for a strongly coupled two - band frhlich hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , the polaron is tightly dressed in each band and can not tunnel between them , leading to an _ inter - band self - trapping _ effect . </S>"
