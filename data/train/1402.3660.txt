    "if @xmath1 is a random matrix , then @xmath7 is a random discrete probability measure .",
    "an extensive body of work has been devoted to the study of the behavior of the spectral measure of large dimensional random matrices .",
    "while wigner @xcite considered hermitian matrices , the non - hermitian case has also attracted attention , starting with the early work by mehta @xcite , who proved , by using explicit formulas due to ginibre @xcite , that the average spectral measure of @xmath0 matrices with i.i.d .",
    "standard complex gaussian entries scaled by @xmath9 converges to the uniform measure on the unit disc .",
    "we will call this measure the _ circular law_. in a series of subsequent developments @xcite , culminating with the work of tao and vu @xcite , this result has been strengthened to almost sure convergence and to sequences of random matrices with i.i.d .",
    "entries of unit variance .",
    "the tao - vu theorem is an instance of the _ universality phenomenon _ , which has become one of the main themes of random matrix theory .",
    "namely the limiting spectral object depends on the actual distribution of the entries of the random matrix only via a global scale parameter such as the variance .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this universal behavior extends to models of random matrices with heavy - tailed entries or with dependent entries .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that the spectral measure of matrices with independent entries in the domain of attraction of an @xmath10-stable distribution with @xmath11 converges to a measure which depends only on @xmath10 and is supported on the whole complex plane .",
    "in particular the limiting distribution is not the circular law .",
    "regarding the independence assumption , several classes of random matrices have been discussed in the literature , starting from models with i.i.d .",

    "log - concave rows @xcite , and random @xmath12 matrices with i.i.d .",
    "rows of given sum @xcite .",
    "the circular law still holds for models with dependent rows , for instance for blocs of haar unitary matrices @xcite , for random doubly stochastic matrices following the uniform distribution on the birkhoff polytope @xcite , for random matrices with log - concave unconditional distribution @xcite , and for random matrices with i.i.d .",
    "quaternionic entries @xcite ( seen as @xmath13 i.i.d .",
    "real blocks with possible dependencies inside the blocks ) .",
    "the present work introduces first a model of random matrices with exchangeable entries , obtained by shuffling a globally constrained deterministic matrix using a random uniform permutation .",
    "such random matrices have dependent entries , rows , and columns .",
    "we show that the asymptotic behavior of the spectral measure is governed by the circular law .",
    "the precise formulation is given in theorem [ th : circular_law ] below .",
    "this first result is then used to deduce the circular law for a larger class of random matrices with exchangeable entries , as stated in theorem [ th : circular_law_2 ] below .",
    "this second result can be seen as a counterpart of the one of chatterjee @xcite , who proved that the spectral measure of symmetric random matrices with exchangeable entries in the upper triangle converges to wigner s semi - circular law , which is the universal limit for random matrices with i.i.d .",
    "entries of finite variance . our model of random matrices with exchangeable entries , like all the available models belonging to the universality class of the circular law ,",
    "has symmetries related to the canonical basis . on the other hand , we stress that the sole invariance under permutation of rows and columns , which is weaker than full exchangeability , is not sufficient , as shown by the simple example of haar unitary random matrices for which the limiting spectral distribution is the uniform distribution on the unit circle ( not the unit disc ! ) often referred to as the arc law @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , note that the uniform law on the birkhoff polytope of doubly stochastic matrices is invariant by permutations of rows or columns , but is not exchangeable globally .",
    "a main tool in our proof is a lower bound on the smallest singular value of random matrices with exchangeable entries , formulated in theorem [ th : ssv ] . in recent years",
    ", an extensive amount of work has been devoted to the analysis of the smallest singular value of random matrices with ( partially ) independent entries or rows , in connection with the circular law , but also with numerical analysis or geometry , which makes our result of independent interest .",
    "our approach follows the path introduced by rudelson and vershynin in @xcite for random matrices with i.i.d .",
    "entries , more precisely what they call the `` soft approach '' ( nothing more is needed for the purpose of the circular law ) .",
    "however several technical problems related to the lack of independence among the entries have to be overcome .      for any @xmath14 ,",
    "let @xmath15 be a deterministic real matrix , with    * @xmath16 ; * @xmath17 .",
    "thanks to assumption ( a2 ) we have @xmath18    of course , the entries of @xmath19 depend typically on @xmath20 , hence the notation .",

    "we consider the random matrix @xmath24 the matrix @xmath25 inherits the structure of @xmath19 .",
    "namely , from ( a1-a2 ) we get @xmath26 since the uniform law on the symmetric group is invariant under translation ( it is a normalized haar measure ) , it follows that the law of @xmath25 is invariant under any deterministic permutation of its @xmath27 coordinates , i.e. the random vector @xmath28\\times[n])$ ] of @xmath29 has exchangeable coordinates . in other words , for every permutation @xmath30 of @xmath23\\times[n]$ ] , @xmath31 it follows that for every @xmath32\\times[n]$ ] , and for every @xmath33\\times[n]$ ] with @xmath34 , @xmath35 except for special choices of @xmath19 , the random matrix @xmath25 is non - hermitian , and even non - normal with high probability .",

    "the random matrix @xmath25 has exchangeable entries obtained by shuffling the globally constrained deterministic matrix @xmath19 using the random uniform permutation @xmath22 .",

    ". this would allow to prove theorem [ th : circular_law_2 ] under the assumption on moments of order @xmath85 .",
    "on the other hand , chatterjee s counterpart @xcite to theorem [ th : circular_law_2 ] in the hermitian case works under the assumption which when translated to our setting would be @xmath86 .",
    "one way to improve our growth / integrability assumptions would be to obtain a better bound on the operator norm of @xmath25 defined in .",

    "this factor comes from the combinatorial central limit theorem and can not be further improved by our methods . in the i.i.d .",
    "case it has been strengthened to @xmath92 by relating the bound on the smallest singular value to the littlewood - offord problem @xcite .",
    "while certain ingredients of this approach can be transferred to the exchangeable setting , an important step seems to rely on a fourier analytic argument , related to esseen s inequality , involving independence of the entries of the matrix .",
    "it would be interesting to develop tools which would allow to use similar ideas in the exchangeable case . note that since the right hand side in theorem [ th : ssv ] is not summable in @xmath20 , one can not use the first borel - cantelli lemma in order to get an almost sure lower bound on @xmath93 .",
    "one can consider a model of the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is deterministic with @xmath96 , satisfying a bound on the operator norm .",

    "in fact one can check that the proof given there works for @xmath21 being a small power of @xmath20 .    however , to get larger range of @xmath21 we will adapt the proof by chatterjee @xcite , who obtained the semi - circular law for symmetric random matrices with exchangeable entries , by using the cauchy - stieltjes trace - resolvent transform , and a generalization of the lindeberg principle for the central limit theorem .    for a probability measure @xmath127 supported on @xmath8 ,",
