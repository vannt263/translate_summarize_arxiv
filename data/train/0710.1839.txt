    "understanding the growth of supermassive black holes along with their host galaxies is one of the fundamental questions in current astrophysics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "although all three emission lines have a common calibration based on the reverberation sample in the local universe , it is important to verify that different recipes give consistent results ; any systematic changes could mimic evolutionary trends given that different recipes are often used in various studies .    at @xmath3",

    ", we compare the different methods of estimating m@xmath0 , and derive a set of self - consistent equations for m@xmath0  estimates using every combination of velocity scale ( fwhm and line dispersion @xmath7 of mgii , h@xmath1 , or h@xmath2 ) and luminosity ( 3000 , 5100- nuclear and total - h@xmath1 , or h@xmath2 ) .",

    "the reduction of the blue spectra was very similar to that of the red spectra described by @xcite , except that arc lamp emission lines for hg and cd were used for wavelength calibration due to the paucity of sky lines .",
    "the flux was calibrated using spectrophotometric stars or a0v type hipparcos stars .",
    "galactic extinction correction was applied to all data based on the average extinction law derived in @xcite .",
    "the final step in the reduction process involved normalizing all spectra to the proper ab magnitude values from the sloan photometric database .",
    "this was achieved by calculating synthetic @xmath15 and @xmath16 magnitudes from the spectra taking into account the sdss bandpasses and finding the constant multiplicative factor appropriate to match the sdss photometry .",
    "the final flux - calibrated spectra of all nineteen observed agns are shown in figures  [ spectra1 ] and  [ spectra2 ] .",
    "the relevant quantities for our purpose are line widths and line and continuum fluxes . in this paper , line widths",
    "are measured as fwhm or line dispersion , i.e. the square root of the second central moment :    @xmath17    where f@xmath18 is the flux density , c is the continuum , @xmath19 is the wavelength and @xmath20 is the central wavelength of the line . as described in this section , we derive line widths and fluxes by fitting a gauss - hermite series to the data after subtraction of the continuum , fe emission , and when necessary a narrow component of the line . while the gauss - hermite fit is not necessary for the high s / n ratio keck data  where the quantities can be measured directly from the data @xcite  the fitting procedure is needed to obtain robust measurements for the noisier sdss data . as we demonstrate below by comparing the h@xmath1 measurements from keck and sdss data , this fitting procedure gives consistent results between the two datasets , and therefore indicates that the quality of the sdss data is adequate to measure the width and flux of h@xmath1 and , especially , h@xmath2 , since the latter is considerably stronger .",
    "the emission lines , especially for h@xmath1 , are often asymmetrical , thus making a symmetrical gaussian approximation of the line profiles undesirable . to account for the asymmetries in the emission lines , we fit a truncated gauss - hermite series to the profiles @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the gauss - hermite expansion is that it provides an orthonormal basis set and that the coefficients of the hermite polynomials ( commonly referred to as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc . )",
    "can be derived by straightforward linear minimization , leaving only two non - linear parameters ( the center and the width of the gaussian ) .",
    "furthermore , the coefficients can be interpreted in terms of the kinematics of the tracing population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the best fit profiles are then used to measure the luminosity , fwhm , and @xmath7 of the emission lines as parameters for the m@xmath0  formulae .",
    "we begin the fitting process with continuum subtraction .",
    "we identify the continuum level on each side of the three emission lines , using a window of 60 @xmath23 . in the case of mgii , a narrower 40 @xmath23 window is used because the blue continuum of mgii is close to the end of the observed spectral range . for mgii ,",
    "the ranges typically used are 2660 - 2700 @xmath23 for the blue continuum level and 2930 - 2970 @xmath23 for the red continuum level .",
    "similarly for h@xmath1 , the ranges are 4670 - 4730  and 5080 - 5140   for blue and red , respectively , and for h@xmath2  the ranges are 6290 - 6350 @xmath23 and 6700 - 6760 @xmath24 .",
    "we then independently subtract the continuum by linear interpolation for each line .",
    "together with the featureless continuum , we also remove broad nuclear fe emission underneath mgii and h@xmath1 .",
    "for this task we use template spectra of i zw 1 kindly provided by todd boroson and ross mclure .",
    "the procedure is similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "a typical example of fe subtraction in the wavelength region around mgii is shown in figure  [ fig : feii ] .",
    "removing nuclear fe emission changes the measured width of h@xmath1 by a negligible amount ( the fwhm is unchanged and @xmath7 is reduced by 0.013 dex ) , but it has a significant effect on mgii ( the fwhm is reduced by 0.027 dex , while @xmath7 is reduced by 0.106 dex ) .    before fitting the broad lines , we subtract out the narrow lines , extending the procedure described by @xcite . for h@xmath1",
    "this involves subtraction of the [ oiii ] @xmath194959 and @xmath195007 narrow lines , as well as the narrow h@xmath1  line .",
    "we subtract [ oiii ] @xmath195007 directly , and subtract [ oiii ] @xmath194959 by dividing [ oiii ] @xmath195007 by 3 and blueshifting .",
    "the narrow component of h@xmath1  is subtracted by rescaling and blueshifting [ oiii ] @xmath195007 .",
    "the line ratio h@xmath25 / [ ] @xmath195007 was allowed to range between 1/20 and the maximum value consistent with the absence of `` dips '' in the broad component ( typically 1/10 - 1/7 ; e.g. marziani et al .",
    "the adopted value of the scale factor is listed in table  [ tab : derive ] .",
    "the narrow component of h@xmath2  is subtracted by multiplying the determined h@xmath1  narrow component by 3.1 @xcite and redshifting .",
    "no attempt is made to remove narrow nii emission lines around h@xmath2 , since they are effectively rejected by the gauss - hermite fitting procedure as noise spikes , nor the narrow component ( if present ) of mgii .",
    "the final step in approximating the line profiles involves fitting the gauss - hermite series to the broad lines .",
    "the fitting procedure finds the minimum @xmath26 by increasing the order of the hermite polynomials as required by the data ( i.e. only if the goodness of fit , measured by the reduced @xmath26 , improves ) .",
    "most objects required up to order 6 polynomials ( i.e. @xmath27 ) to plateau in reduced @xmath26",
    ". figures  [ fig : fits1 ] to  [ fig : fits3 ] show our best fits to the mgii , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath2 lines for the nineteen objects .",
    "the derived measurements of @xmath7 and fwhm , after removal of the instrumental resolution , are listed in table  [ tab : derive ] .",
    "the formulae for m@xmath0  estimates require line luminosities or monochromatic continuum luminosities at given wavelengths .",
    "for consistency with @xcite the line luminosities are calculated from the total flux for the combined broad and narrow components of the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 emission lines , where the broad component is taken as the best gauss - hermite fit , and the narrow component is taken as the appropriately scaled and shifted [ oiii ] @xmath195007 narrow line ( see   [ ssec : gauss ] ) .",
    "we note that the narrow components contribute only a small fraction of the total flux of the balmer lines ( e.g. , @xmath145% for h@xmath1  see table  2 , and similarly to h@xmath2 ) and therefore they make a contribution of about 0.01 dex to the broad - line size estimates .",
    "the h@xmath2 to h@xmath1 flux ratio ranges between 3 and 7 as expected for seyfert 1s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the total continuum luminosity at 3000 ( 5100 ) @xmath23 is calculated from the average flux in the 2950 - 3050 ( 5050 - 5150 ) @xmath23 rest frame . in this paper",
    ", we use the term total continuum luminosity to indicate the total luminosity as measured within the spectroscopic aperture , i.e. without removing the host galaxy contamination .",
    "the fraction of host galaxy contamination depends on the properties of the individual object as well as on the instrumental setup , and it is hence a source of scatter . nevertheless , the total luminosity is often the only measurement available and therefore it is important to investigate estimators based on this quantity .",
    "the total continuum luminosities at 5100 @xmath23 measured from the sdss spectra agree to within a few per cent of those inferred from the keck spectra and those listed in the paper by @xcite . by comparing the values listed here with respect to those given by @xcite , we infer 0.014 dex as the error on the continuum ( l@xmath28 and l@xmath29 ) . for line luminosities ,",
    "we compare measurements on the fit with measurements on the data , and we take the r.m.s .",
    "scatter as the average error .",
    "this error is 0.011 and 0.062 dex on l@xmath30 and l@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "nuclear luminosities are taken from the hst measurements presented by @xcite , except for three objects ( s11 , s28 , and s29 ) , where the nuclear luminosity has been estimated from scaling the total luminosity by the average nuclear fraction for the sample , 0.31 .",
    "in addition to measurement errors , agn variability effectively limits the accuracy of the calibration of luminosity - based estimators , to the typical level of variability of 5 - 10% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the m@xmath0  estimators depend either on @xmath7 or on the fwhm as a measurement of line width , and hence of the broad line kinematics .",
    "both of these quantities were measured from the gauss - hermite fit to the broad lines .",
    "errors on the keck line width measurements are obtained by comparison with those reported by @xcite , which were measured independently and did not rely on gauss - hermite expansion .",
    "the average error is 0.017 dex for the mgii and h@xmath1  fwhm and @xmath7 .",
    "the errors on the sdss h@xmath2 line width measurements are obtained by comparing the results for h@xmath1 with the keck fit and assuming that the error is the same for h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 .",
    "the average error is 0.051 dex for @xmath7 and 0.040 dex for the fwhm .",
    "the distribution of the fwhm to @xmath7 ratios is shown in figure  [ fig : widthhisto ] .",
    "the average ratio for h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 is close to the gaussian value ( 2.35 ) , although with large scatter , consistent with the sample of @xcite . for mgii",
    "the average is considerably smaller indicating significant departure from gaussianity .",
    "a large range of fwhm/@xmath7 ratios indicates a large scatter between m@xmath0  based on fwhm and m@xmath0  based on @xmath7  for the sample since velocity is simply derived either from fwhm or @xmath7by multiplying by a constant as shown in ",
    "[ sec : form ] ( see detailed discussion by @xcite ) .    figure  [ fig : widthcomp ] compares the fwhm of mgii with that of h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 .",
    "the fwhm are correlated albeit with substantial scatter . comparing all the velocity scales , the average ratios and r.m.s .",
    "scatters ( in parenthesis ) are : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "summarizing these relations , the width of h@xmath2 is generally narrower by @xmath1420% than that of h@xmath1 as expected from other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while mgii and h@xmath1 are similar in fwhm but not in @xmath7 .",
    "these differences are expected given that different lines trace different species and that their shapes reflect the ionization and excitation variations throughout the region .",
    "this finding implies that each line has to be calibrated independently as a velocity estimator and that one can not go from fwhm to @xmath7 using the simple scaling for a gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore , we conclude that in general and balmer line width can not be used interchangeably , although in the case of the fwhm of mg and h@xmath1 the ratio is close to unity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussion ) .",
    "as far as m@xmath0 estimators are concerned , the scatter is of order 0.1 dex ( i.e. significantly larger than the measurement errors ) , which sets a lower limit of @xmath36 dex on the relative uncertainty of the cross calibration of simple velocity estimators based on line widths .",
    "we begin this section with a list of the 12 formulae for m@xmath0estimation considered in this paper (   [ ssec : formi ] ) . in these formulae ,",
    "we adopt a notation where l@xmath37total luminosity @xmath38 at @xmath39 , l@xmath40nuclear luminosity @xmath38 at @xmath39 , and l@xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "all formulae are given in the original notation , without applying any correction for different assumptions on the virial coefficient .",
    "in   [ ssec : res ] we will compare the various estimators to infer how much they differ when applied to the same sample of objects before presenting our cross - calibrated recipes in   [ sec : res ] .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite give equations based on the width of the mgii line and the optical / uv continuum luminosity :    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xcite and @xcite present equations based on the width and luminosities of the h@xmath1  and h@xmath2 broad lines :    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite adopt the following formulae based on l@xmath29 and the width of the h@xmath1  broad line :    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    note that the formulae listed above adopt different estimators of broad - line region velocity ( @xmath7 or fwhm ) and size ( continuum luminosity or line luminosity ) .      in this section",
    "we assess the relative consistency of the m@xmath0estimators taken from the literature by comparison with our fiducial black hole mass @xmath55 ( as listed in the paper by treu et al .",
    "the choice of the fiducial estimator is based on reverberation mapping studies of local agns , which are mostly based on h@xmath1 and @xmath56 .",
    "these studies show that @xmath7 is the most robust velocity estimator @xcite .",
    "they determine the slope of the size - luminosity relation , taking into account the host galaxy contamination @xcite , and they set the virial coefficient by requiring that the m@xmath0-@xmath57 relation be the same for active and quiescent galaxies , modulo selection effects @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the formulae @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62  have been calibrated on the isotropic spherical virial coefficient ( f=3/4 in the notation of netzer , 1990 ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 adopt f=1 , and @xmath55 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68  are based on the recalibration of the virial coefficient given by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent on average with our result for the balmer lines , albeit with large scatter , but not for the line . ] .",
    "therefore , we expect the first set of m@xmath0estimators to give lower values than @xmath55 by @xmath69 dex , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 to give lower values by @xmath70 dex . in the case of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , an isotropic spherical virial coefficient was used . however , their equations were based on a different size - luminosity relation , hence making these formulae approximately equivalent to having the same virial coefficient as @xmath55 , @xmath65 , and @xmath68  @xcite . as noted by @xcite , @xmath65 , @xmath68 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62  agree on average to within a few per cent of @xmath55 .",
    "the more discrepant black hole masses are those with different virial coefficients , which can differ on average by as much as @xmath4 dex ( i.e. more than a factor of two ) . even renormalizing these formulae to the same virial coefficient would still leave discrepancies of order 0.1 dex : after renormalization , @xmath66 and @xmath59   are approximately 0.1 dex larger than @xmath55  while @xmath58 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64  are still 0.1 dex smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "this is approximately twice the expected error on the mean given the size of the sample .",
    "these results show that _ systematic _ errors as large as @xmath4 dex can be introduced when comparing m@xmath0 estimates based on different diagnostics or when comparing agn m@xmath0 estimates to local samples with direct m@xmath0  measurements from stellar or gaseous kinematics .",
    "we conclude by discussing the absolute calibration of our fiducial mass estimator .",
    "a study by @xcite finds that for the local sample with reverberation based m@xmath0 , the widths of the balmer lines measured on mean spectra are systematically larger than those measured on the r.m.s .",
    "spectra for variable objects , suggesting that a smaller virial coefficient than that advocated by @xcite and used for our fiducial mass estimator , should be adopted when measuring widths from mean spectra .",
    "this could possibly indicate that our fiducial m@xmath0 are overestimated by approximately 0.15 dex . to investigate this effect , in section  [ sec : res ] we apply our calibrated recipes  based on our fiducial estimator  to the local sample with reverberation based m@xmath0 , using published line widths and fluxes measured from single epoch and mean spectra .",
    "as discussed in the next section , we find an excellent agreement with the mass inferred from reverberation mapping based on line widths from the r.m.s .",
    "spectra , indicating that no such correction is necessary .",
    "data for a larger number of objects with reverberation - based masses are needed to determine the zero point of the virial scalings more accurately , as discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we examine all possible combinations of velocity and flux estimators to produce a set of cross calibrated recipes . by comparing with our fiducial mass estimator @xmath55 ,",
    "we compute the r.m.s . scatter of the residuals to infer a lower limit on the intrinsic uncertainty of each recipe .    in practice",
    ", we adopt the following relation :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is a velocity estimator in units of 1000 km s@xmath11 , l is a luminosity estimator in units of 10@xmath73 erg s@xmath11 or 10@xmath74 erg s@xmath11 , respectively for continuum or line luminosity , and we find the @xmath2 that best matches the @xmath55 fiducial estimates .",
    "our range in luminosities is too small to fit for @xmath1 as well , and therefore , we assert the following fiducial values : @xmath75 for l@xmath28 , 0.518 for l@xmath76 , 0.67 for l@xmath77 , 0.56 for h@xmath1 , and 0.55 for h@xmath2 .",
    "these choices are based on the most current calibration of the size - luminosity relation for each wavelength / line . in particular , following the results of the study by @xcite we adopt 0.518 as the slope of the broad - line region size vs _ nuclear _ luminosity relation , while for the size vs _ total _ luminosity ( i.e. including host galaxy contamination within the spectroscopic aperture ) relation we adopt the slope given by @xcite .",
    "although the former slope is to be preferred when the nuclear luminosity is available , we also provide results for the second slope , which appears to be the best estimate whenever the light from the nucleus and from the host galaxy can not be disentangled . in general",
    ", extrapolations well outside the range considered here are to be done with caution , since most of the local calibrators for the size - luminosity relation are seyferts and pg quasars in @xmath78 .",
    "we emphasize that this procedure produces self consistent mass estimates , but these all share a common uncertainty in the zero point . in practice , all @xmath2 can be shifted by a constant if it turns out that a different value of the virial coefficient for the local sample of reverberation mapped agns is to be preferred . as a sanity check , we applied our calibrated recipes to the local sample with reverberation m@xmath0 ( @xcite and recent updates by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "based on the single epoch measurements given by @xcite we compared our two estimators based on the fwhm of h@xmath1 , and on l@xmath77 and h@xmath1 line flux , with the reverberation masses .",
    "the agreement is excellent , with average @xmath79 equal to 0.009 dex and 0.023 , respectively , with r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.46 dex and 0.49 dex .",
    "based on the measurements from mean spectra given by @xcite we compared our two estimators based on the fwhm and line dispersion of h@xmath1 , and on l@xmath77 , with the reverberation masses .",

    "scatter of 0.35 and 0.29 dex .",
    "the scatter of the difference is combination of effects from uncertainties in time - lag , line width , and luminosity measurements , and scatter in the size - luminosity relation .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath2 together with the r.m.s .",
    "scatter are listed in table  [ tab : alphas ] .",
    "the best fit relations are shown in figure  [ fig : bhm ] .",
    "we note that we included in the recipes the combination of h@xmath1 @xmath7 and l@xmath76 that was used to compute @xmath55 by @xcite .",
    "the goal of this exercise is to estimate the measurement errors associated with the relation , given that the input parameters were measured independently for this paper , based on the gauss - hermite polynomial expansion fit .",
    "since measurement errors such as narrow line and continuum subtraction dominate over pixel noise , given the high s / n of the keck data , the r.m.s .",
    "of these residuals divided by @xmath81 is effectively the total measurement error , i.e. @xmath82 dex .",
    "thus we can conclude that , for all practical purposes , the r.m.s .",
    "scatter that we observe for the other recipes is intrinsic scatter in the relation and not measurement error .",
    "this is also the rationale for not showing measurement error bars in the plots .",
    "looking at table  [ tab : alphas ] , it appears that the smallest relative scatter is obtained when comparing @xmath55 to black hole masses based on the same velocity scale @xmath83 .",
    "this is not surprising , as the velocity scale enters with the square in the m@xmath0estimate and we have seen that velocity scales have typical relative scatter of 0.1 dex .",
    "however , the scatter means that adopting optical / uv continuum luminosity as a proxy of the size of the broad - line region introduces an uncertainty of @xmath14 0.10 - 0.15 dex in the m@xmath0  estimate , with the larger r.m.s .",
    "for the line luminosities .",
    "the velocity scale that best matches the @xmath7 of h@xmath1 is the line width of mgii , which gives an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.17 dex .",
    "this is better than the @xmath7 of h@xmath2 ( 0.20 dex ) and the fwhm of h@xmath1 ( 0.23 dex )  as expected from the large distribution of fwhm/@xmath7 ratios  which are in turn slightly better than the other indicators .",
    "the worst match is obtained for line luminosities with fwhm , with an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of @xmath84 dex . from this study , we infer a lower limit to the relative accuracy of the various indicators of order 0.1 - 0.2 dex , depending on the choice of estimators .",
    "if the relationships presented here were to be extended beyond the range of m@xmath0  considered , it is likely that the scatter will increase , as suggested by the slope of the points in the corresponding panels .",
    "otherwise , the slope @xmath1 of the size luminosity relation will have to be fitted independently .",
    "in this paper we have used keck and sdss spectra of nineteen seyferts at @xmath3 , to perform a comprehensive study of `` virial '' black hole mass estimators for broad line agns .",

    "we have fit gauss - hermite series to the data in order to measure the fwhm and @xmath7 of mgii , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath2 , as well as h@xmath2 and h@xmath1 luminosities and continuum luminosities at 3000and 5100 .",
    "measurement errors are approximately 0.02 dex on the mgii and h@xmath1  line widths , 0.04 - 0.05 on the h@xmath2  line widths , 0.01 dex on the continuum luminosity , 0.01 dex on the h@xmath1  luminosity , and 0.06 dex on the h@xmath2  luminosity .",
    "we have compared twelve formulae taken from the literature , showing that m@xmath0  estimates can differ systematically by as much as @xmath4 dex ( or @xmath5 dex , if the same virial coefficient is adopted ) .",
    "such differences should be taken into account when comparing data obtained with different methods .",
    "we have cross - calibrated a set of 30 empirical recipes based on all combinations of the velocity and luminosity indicators corresponding to the , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath2  broad lines .",
    "taking the masses measured by treu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as our fiducial black hole masses , we find that : the absolute scale of the different indicators is calibrated to within @xmath140.05 dex ; the best agreement is found when using the line dispersion of h@xmath1 as a velocity estimator , with the residual 0.1 dex r.m.s .",
    "scatter resulting from the various continuum luminosity estimators ; adopting the line dispersion of raises the scatter to 0.2 dex ; for the other estimators the intrinsic scatter is in the range 0.2 - 0.38 dex .",
