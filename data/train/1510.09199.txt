    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theories ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite , which relates a @xmath0-dimensional quantum field theory with its dual gravitational theory that lives in @xmath1 dimensions , has been employed to gain a better understanding of the high @xmath2 superconductor systems from the gravitational dual , for reviews , see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "it was suggested that the instability of the bulk black hole corresponds to a second order phase transition from normal state to superconducting state which brings the spontaneous @xmath3 symmetry breaking @xcite , and the properties of a ( @xmath4)-dimensional superconductor can indeed be reproduced in the ( @xmath5)-dimensional holographic dual model where the ads black hole geometry corresponds to a relativistic cft at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "since many condensed matter systems do not have relativistic symmetry , it is of great interest to construct the corresponding holographic superconductor models by using the nonrelativistic version of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the holographic superconductors in the lifshitz black hole spacetime were constructed in refs . @xcite and further investigated in ref .",
    "it was observed that the lifshitz black hole geometry results in different asymptotic behaviors of temporal and spatial components of gauge fields than those in the schwarzschild - ads black hole , which brings some new features of holographic superconductor models @xcite .",

    "recently , the so - called hyperscaling violation metric @xcite which can be considered as an extension of the lifshitz metric has received considerable attention due to its potential applications to the condensed matter physics @xcite . besides the anisotropic ( lifshitz ) scaling characterized by the dynamic critical exponent @xmath6 @xcite",
    ", the hyperscaling violation can also be used to describe holographically the realistic condensed matter systems with scaling properties going beyond the standard lorentz scaling at criticality @xcite .",

    "thus , we will reinvestigate the holographic s - wave superconductors with hyperscaling violation in this work .",
    "in addition to giving a more complete picture of how the hyperscaling violation affects the condensation for the scalar operator and the conductivity , we will present an interesting fact that the value of the hyperscaling violation , which gives the minimum critical temperature , remains unchanged even we vary the mass of the scalar field .",
    "furthermore , comparing with the second order trial function used in ref .",
