    "it is believed that the vacuum of the su(@xmath0 ) yang - mills theories should be in the colour - confined phase at zero or low temperature , while at sufficiently high temperature the colour - deconfined phase would emerge where perturbative calculations do well or at least somewhat make sense .    in the su(@xmath0 ) pure yang - mills theories at finite temperature the centre symmetry is known to be deeply connected with the criteria of colour confinement@xcite .",
    "the order parameter of the symmetry is given by the expectation value of the polyakov loop operator , @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the inverse temperature , @xmath3 is the time ordering operator and @xmath4 denotes the trace over the colour index in the fundamental representation .",
    "one can readily relate it to the free energy @xmath5 in the presence of a single quark with infinitely heavy mass : @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the confined phase ( @xmath7 ) corresponds to @xmath8 , whereas @xmath9 in the deconfined phase .",
    "if the vacuum is centre symmetric , that is to say @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , it follows that @xmath8 , i.e.  that the realization of the centre symmetry is accompanied by the confining vacuum .    the effective potential of the polyakov loop has been calculated both in the perturbative approach@xcite and in the strong - coupling expansion on the lattice@xcite .",
    "the perturbative results have revealed that the centre symmetry is broken spontaneously due to the appearance of the debye mass at high temperature .",
    "it was also proven that any perturbative calculation inevitably leads to @xmath12 , that is the perturbative vacuum@xcite , though the proof is based on the suspicious assumption that the haar measure could be harmlessly negligible .",
    "recently , however , bohik@xcite and engelhardt and reinhardt@xcite have pointed out in the polyakov gauge ( static gauge @xmath13 with an additional condition that @xmath14 should be diagonal ) that the effective action , which includes not only potential terms but also kinetic terms , has a singularity right at the perturbative vacuum .",
    "the singularity stems from the haar measure , whose meaning is still a little confused@xcite .",
    "this fact seems to suggest that the haar measure or some configurations with spatial variations such as calorons ( multi - instantons at finite temperature ) , magnetic monopoles and domain walls might be relevant to the dynamics of the confinement - deconfinement mechanism .",
    "these former results , however , are somewhat ambiguous with respect to the two points , i.e.  _ renormalization _ and _ gauge invariance_. because of the singular character of the polyakov gauge , it is likely that gauge spurious objects might arise from incomplete renormalization . thus instead of using the singular polyakov gauge we prefer the covariant background field gauge in our calculation as in @xcite at the cost of the renormalization necessary for the polyakov loop",
    ".    one might think that the kinetic energy must be dominated by the tree term and that the loop corrections should be much smaller than the tree term so as to make sense of the perturbative calculation .",
    "however , the longitudinal gluon propagator , for instance , acquires the debye mass from the contribution of the loop corrections and then in the soft momentum region the tree term @xmath15 proportional to squared momentum can be certainly negligible compared with the finite debye mass . of course , when the momentum becomes larger the tree term grows to be dominant eventually .",
    "consequently , one has to take account of loop corrections until the momentum exceeds the order of @xmath16 .",
    "because we are interested in the momentum region around @xmath16 , the effective action should be expanded in powers of variational amplitudes instead of derivatives or momenta@xcite .",

    "[ sec : per_eva ] is divided into three subsections .",
    "firstly , we expand the one - loop effective action to quadratic variational terms .",
    "the result suggests possible instability for the perturbative vacuum .",
    "secondly , quartic terms are found to stabilize the slipped vacuum .",
    "finally we remark upon the zero temporal modes and the resultant cubic term in the potential . in sec .",

    "we evaluate the variational term of quartic order from which all the temporal zero - mode terms are subtracted to be resummed afterwards .",
    "once we get rid of the zero mode it can be expected that the result will be almost independent of @xmath114 in the interested region @xmath136 , because the expansion in terms of @xmath114 becomes a power series of @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the momentum to be integrated and @xmath29 is the matsubara frequency .",

    "it is therefore probable that the position of the absolute minimum jumps from @xmath101 to @xmath208 in the su(3 ) case if the free energy density is attained in a non - perturbative way , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "it might seem curious that in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_ene ] the potential value at @xmath210 is lower than that at @xmath211 near @xmath102 ; this is because we have searched for the most unstable mode @xmath212 within a range larger than @xmath213 in order to avoid spurious negative values of the running coupling constant .",
    "when the temperature becomes larger , the lower bound of the momentum range to be searched decreases and thus the potential value also decreases .",
    "we investigate the effective action of the polyakov loop defined in a field - theoretic manner .",
    "the gauge invariance of the effective action can be proven by the same strategy as deriving the gauge dependence identities .",
    "owing to the appropriate definition of the effective action any effect of the renormalization of the polyakov loop that is necessary for higher - order calculations is automatically generated through non - local interaction vertices . in order to evaluate the effective action we choose the background field gauge where the background gauge symmetry remains manifestly . in this gauge the most essential properties to attain reliable results ,",
    "that is , the gauge invariance and the unambiguous renormalization , are satisfied simultaneously .    in the actual calculation",
    "we expand the effective action in powers of the variational amplitudes @xmath83 instead of the derivatives .",
    "the quadratic term of the variational field shows the possibility of the vacuum instability for marginal modes around @xmath101 or for the constant background @xmath103 .",
    "the reason why the vacuum may become unstable is comprehensible from our resultant expression : as for the former case ( @xmath101 ) , the variational background is usually absent because such a configuration costs more kinetic energy . in the thermal circumstance , however , on - shell particles are excited to obey the thermal distribution function , in addition to the quantum excitation .",
    "if the mode of the variational background becomes comparable with the inter - distance of the thermal particles , i.e.@xmath214 and if the interaction is sufficiently strong , then the vacuum can decay into non - vanishing variational background .",
    "as for the latter case ( @xmath103 ) the statistical character of the transverse gluon changes into that of the fermi particle , that is to say , the transverse gluon obeys the antiperiodic boundary condition .",
    "moreover the distribution number of particles turns to be negative .",
    "the serious problem we encounter is the magnitude of the coupling constant .",
    "it depends on the smallness of coupling constant whether our effective action at one - loop order is reliable or not . in the su(3 ) case the critical coupling constant is @xmath131 . particularly at finite temperature",
    "this value is too large to regard it as small .",
    "it is well known that the higher - order corrections to the free energy up to @xmath215 order ( this is the upper limit of linde s problem ) is so oscillating that the perturbative series does not seem to converge at all .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the physical picture may be reflected qualitatively in the one - loop effective action .",
    "it is an interesting and essential point that the kinetic term of the effective action even at one - loop order can bring about instability at the perturbative vacuum , which is out of reach of the conventional effective potential .",
    "the effective action at one - loop order already has a non - trivial physical content .",
    "once we pursue the policy of studying the physics contained in the one - loop effective action or believe in the perturbative evaluation despite the large coupling value , we can proceed to expand the effective action to quartic order .",
    "a brief discussion reveals that the quartic term is independent of modes provided that the temporal zero mode is subtracted .",
    "looking over the weiss potential we can see that any terms higher than quartic order come from the temporal zero mode .",
    "the zero - mode resummation is performed , where we make clear the origin of the cubic term in the weiss potential .",
    "the effective action density determines the stationary vacuum for the variational background @xmath83 and the constant background @xmath82 .",
    "the minimum lies at @xmath101 so that the polyakov loop decreases only by non - vanishing @xmath88 provided that the instability near @xmath102 is harmless .",
    "since we know that in the su(2 ) case the transition is continuous ( second order ) , the instability found in this paper is likely to be relevant to the real physics . in the su(3 )",
    "case , on the other hand , the discontinuous transition implies the possibility that the infrared instability around @xmath102 comes to play an essential role .",
    "it is necessary , of course , that the qualitative argument discussed here is justified by some reliable method other than perturbative evaluations .",
    "some methods , such as the thermal renormalization group and infrared effective theory successfully predict the non - perturbative contribution for the infrared region .",
    "the application of these methods to estimate the effective action is quite difficult due to the presence of the non - local intricate vertices corresponding to the renormalization of the polyakov loop . that is the future work to resolve .",
