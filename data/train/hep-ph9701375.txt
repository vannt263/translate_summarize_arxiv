    "the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) is a convenient tool to describe the physics of hadrons containing a heavy quark @xcite .",
    "it provides a systematic expansion around the limit @xmath4 , in which new symmetries of the strong interactions arise , relating the long - distance properties of many observables to a small number of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the hqet is @xcite@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] is the gluon field - strength tensor , and @xmath7 the velocity - dependent field describing a heavy quark inside a hadron moving with velocity @xmath8 .",
    "this field is subject to the constraint @xmath9 .",
    "the leading term in the effective lagrangian , which gives rise to the feynman rules of the hqet , is invariant under a global @xmath10 spin  flavour symmetry group , where @xmath11 is the number of heavy - quark flavours .",
    "this symmetry is broken by the higher - dimensional operators arising at order @xmath12 .",
    "the first operator corresponds to the kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside the hadron , and the second operator describes the magnetic interaction of the heavy - quark spin with the gluon field .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 result from short - distance effects and , in general , depend on the scale at which the operators are renormalized .",
    "hadronic matrix elements of the higher - dimensional operators in ( [ leff ] ) play a significant role in many applications of the hqet .",
    "it is therefore important to study the properties of these operators , in particular under renormalization .",
    "the reparametrization invariance of the hqet ( an invariance under infinitesimal changes of the velocity ) implies that , in regularization schemes with a dimensionless regulator , the kinetic operator is not renormalized , i.e.  @xmath15 to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite . ( in regularization schemes with a dimensionful regulator , the kinetic operator mixes with lower - dimensional operators @xcite . ) the renormalization of the chromo - magnetic operator at the one - loop order is known for some time @xcite .",
    "it is governed by the anomalous dimension , defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the renormalization constant that relates the bare operator with the renormalized one , @xmath18 .",
    "the last relation is valid in dimensional regularization with a ms - like subtraction scheme , such as @xmath0 @xcite , and follows from the requirement that the anomalous dimension be finite as @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the coefficient of the @xmath21 pole in @xmath17 . at the one - loop order , @xmath22 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the anomalous dimension to two - loop order .",
    "this completes the renormalization of the hqet lagrangian at order @xmath12 , and to next - to - leading order in @xmath23 .    a direct calculation of the renormalization factor @xmath17 at order @xmath24 would require the evaluation of a large number of two - loop diagrams .",
    "the equivalent calculation for the chromo - magnetic operator of a light quark has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for heavy quarks ,",
    "we follow a different strategy , which exploits the symmetries of the hqet . instead of the chromo - magnetic operator itself ,",
    "we study the renormalization of the two operators @xmath25 for the special choice @xmath26 , the first operator reduces to the chromo - magnetic operator , while the second one vanishes . because the feynman rules of the hqet do not involve @xmath27 matrices , the dirac structure of @xmath28 is not altered by radiative corrections , and it is of advantage to treat it as a general matrix .",
    "then the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 form a basis of physical ( class-1 ) operators , i.e.  operators that do not vanish by the equations of motion .",
    "the mixing of these operators under renormalization is such that @xcite @xmath31 in the rest frame of the heavy quark , the operator @xmath30 contains only chromo - electric field components .",
    "the virial theorem of the hqet @xcite relates this operator to the kinetic operator in ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "since the kinetic operator is not renormalized , we have the exact relation @xmath32 , i.e.  @xcite @xmath33 below we calculate @xmath34 to order @xmath24 , and then use ( [ nice ] ) and ( [ gammag ] ) to obtain the two - loop anomalous dimension of the chromo - magnetic operator .",
    "the particular structure of the operator @xmath30 greatly facilitates the calculation . to obtain the factor @xmath34 in ( [ mix ] ) at order @xmath24",
    ", we calculate the insertion of @xmath29 into the amputated green function with two heavy quarks and a ( background - field ) gluon to two - loop order , as well as the one - loop diagrams with counterterm insertions needed to subtract the subdivergences of the two - loop diagrams",

    "then , taking into account the feynman rules of the hqet , it is straightforward to derive the following selection rules :    1 .",
    "if the external gluon is attached to the operator , the diagram is proportional to @xmath41 or @xmath42 and does not contribute to the structure @xmath40 .",
    "if the external gluon is attached to a heavy - quark line , the diagram only depends on @xmath43 and does not contribute to the desired structure . on the other hand , the external gluon must be connected to a heavy - quark line through other gluons ( or through a light - fermion or ghost loop ) , otherwise one can not get @xmath44 .",
    "the external gluon must be connected to the operator through other gluons ( or through a light - fermion or ghost loop ) .",
    "if it is not , one can not get @xmath45 .",
    "accounting for these rules , only the two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] need to be calculated at the one - loop order .",
    "they give identical contributions . at the two - loop order ,",
    "all diagrams that yield terms proportional to @xmath40 can be generated by first drawing the two - loop diagrams that contribute to the heavy - quark two - point function with an insertion of @xmath29 , and then attaching an external gluon in all possible ways to one of the gluon , ghost or light - quark lines or vertices .",
    "this gives rise to the graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] .    in evaluating the two - loop diagrams",
    ", we only need to keep terms linear in the gluon momentum @xmath39 .",
    "because the pole parts are polynomial in the external momenta , we can first take one derivative with respect to @xmath39 and then set @xmath46 and @xmath47 , so that all integrals are of propagator type and depend on the single variable @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the external momenta of the heavy quarks .",
    "however , this straightforward application of the method of infrared ( ir ) rearrangement @xcite fails for some of the diagrams ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , for which setting @xmath46 after differentiation leads to ir divergences . in these cases ,",

    "@xmath68 becomes a tadpole integral and vanishes , so that @xmath69 coincides with the original integral with @xmath39 set to zero .",
    "this integral can be calculated using the general algorithm described below .",
    "on dimensional grounds , it is proportional to @xmath70 . the contribution @xmath68 , which is necessary to subtract the ir subdivergence of the original integral @xmath67 , factorizes into an ir counterterm ( the @xmath63 integral ) and the original diagram with the lines of the ir sensitive subgraph removed .",
    "this deletion of lines follows from the locality of ir divergences in momentum space . because of this factorization , ir subtraction terms such as @xmath71 are proportional to @xmath72",
    "the construction just described is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rstar ] .",
