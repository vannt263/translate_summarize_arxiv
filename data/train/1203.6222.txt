    "the accurate determination of the hubble constant , @xmath0 , is considered one of the most fundamental tasks in the interface between astronomy and cosmology .",
    "the importance of measuring the expansion rate of the universe to high precision stems from the fact that @xmath0 , besides providing cosmic distances , is also a prerequisite for independent constraints on the mass - energy content of the universe ( e.g. , suyu et al .",
    "the direct determination of the hubble constant can only be obtained by measuring cosmic distances and mapping the local expansion of the universe , since the hubble relation , @xmath6 , is valid and independent of the mass - energy content of the universe only locally ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a variety of methods have been used to estimate @xmath0 , based on cepheids , surface brightness fluctuations , masers , the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , or type ia supernovae [ sne  ia ] ( for general reviews see jackson 2007 ; tammann , sandage & reindl 2008 ; freedman & madore 2010 ) .",
    "in particular , the use of sne  ia to measure the hubble constant has a long history in astronomy ( eg . ,",
    "sandage & tammann 1982 ; 1990 ) .",
    "the subsequent discovery of the correlation between the magnitude at peak brightness and the rate at which it declines thereafter ( eg . , phillips 1993 ) allowed the reduction of the distance determination intrinsic scatter .",
    "however , one has to remember that sne  ia are secondary indicators and their use relies on the determination of well - established local calibrators , like the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , galactic cepheids , the `` maser '' galaxy ngc 4258 , etc .",
    "riess et al . 2011 ) .",
    "indirect methods to measure @xmath0 have also been developed ( e.g. bonamente et al .",
    "2006 ; suyu et al .",
    "2010 ; beutler et al .",
    "2011 ) , however , all of the indirect methods use as priors other cosmological parameters , and thus the resulting @xmath0 determinations are model dependent . returning to the direct method to estimate @xmath0 , an important breakthrough occurred a decade or so ago by the _ hst _",
    "calibration program ( saha et al . 2001 ; sandage et al .",
    "2006 ) who found cepheids in local galaxies that host sne  ia and provided a cepheid based zero - point calibration , and by the _ hst _ key project ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) who furnished a value of @xmath8 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , based on cepheid distances of external galaxies and the lmc as the first rung of the distance ladder .",
    "this value was recently revised by the same authors , using a new cepheid zero - point ( benedict et al .",
    "2007 ) and the new sne  ia of hicken et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , to a similar but less uncertain value of @xmath9 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( see freedman & madore 2010 ) .",
    "tammann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used a variety of local calibrators to recalibrate the sne  ia and found a significantly lower value of @xmath10 km s@xmath5mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the difference has since been explained as being due to a variety of external causes among which the use of heavily reddened galactic cepheids and of less accurate photographic data ( riess et al .",
    "2009a , b ) .",
    "the most recent analysis of riess et al .",
    "( 2011 ) uses new _",
    "hst _ optical and infrared observations of 600 cepheid variables to determine the distance to eight galaxies hosting recent sne  ia .",
    "the resulting best estimate for the hubble constant is : @xmath11 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 including random and systematic errors .    from the above discussion it becomes clear that sne  ia are the only tracers of the hubble expansion utilized to - date , over a relatively wide redshift range ( @xmath12 )",
    "therefore , due to the great importance of direct determinations of the hubble constant for cosmological studies ( eg .",
    ", suyu et al 2012 ) it is highly desirable to independently confirm the sne  ia based @xmath0 value by using an alternative tracer .",
    "hii galaxies have been proposed as such an alternative .",
    "they are massive and compact ( in many cases unresolved ) bursts of star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of hii galaxies is completely overpowered by that of the starburst . as a consequence",
    "they show the spectrum of a young hii region , that indeed is what they are , hence their name .",
    "their similarity with gehr is underlined by the fact that the first examples of prototype hii galaxies , i  zw18 and ii  zw40 , were called  isolated extragalactic hii regions \" and found to be observationally indistinguishable from gehr in nearby galaxies ( sargent and searle 1970 ) .",
    "they are discovered mainly in spectroscopic surveys due to their strong narrow emission lines , i.e. very large equivalent widths .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the optical properties of hii galaxies are those of the young burst with almost no information ( or contamination ) from the parent galaxy .",
    "this is a direct consequence of selecting hii galaxies as those systems with the largest equivalent width ( w ) in their emission lines , i.e. w(h@xmath13 50 .    because the starburst component can reach very high luminosity , hii galaxies",
    "can be observed at large redshifts ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "what makes these galaxies interesting cosmological distance probes ( cf .",
    "melnick , terlevich & terlevich 2000 ; siegel et al .",
    "2005 ) is the fact that as the mass of the starburst component increases , both the number of ionizing photons and the turbulent velocity of the gas , which is dominated by the star and gas gravitational potential , also increases .",
    "this induces a correlation between the luminosity of recombination lines , e.g. @xmath15 and the ionized gas velocity dispersion @xmath16 ( see terlevich & melnick 1981 ; hippelein 1986 ; melnick , terlevich & moles 1988 ; melnick , terlevich & terlevich 2000 ; fuentes - masip et al .",
    "2000 ; telles et al . 2001 , bosch et al . 2002 ; siegel et al . 2005 ; bordalo & telles 2011 ) .",
    "a first attempt to estimate @xmath0 , using hii galaxies and gehr as local calibrators , was presented in melnick , terlevich & moles ( 1988 ) .",
    "the use of hii galaxies as deep cosmological tracers was discussed by melnick , terlevich & terlevich ( 2000 ) and siegel et al .",
    "recently , we presented a thorough investigation of the viability of using hii galaxies to constrain the dark energy equation of state , accounting also for the effects of gravitational lensing , which are expected to be non - negligible for very high redshift ` standard candles ' and we showed that indeed hii galaxies can provide an important cosmological probe ( plionis et al .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to use hii galaxies and a local calibration of the @xmath1  relation based on gehr of nearby galaxies , as an alternative direct approach for estimating the hubble constant over a redshift range of @xmath17 .",
    "a sample of 128 hii galaxies was selected from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic data release ( abazajian , et al .",
    "2009 ) within a redshift range @xmath18 , chosen for being compact ( @xmath19 ) , having large balmer emission line fluxes and equivalent widths .",
    "a lower limit for the equivalent width of @xmath20 of 50   was chosen to avoid starbursts that are either evolved or contaminated by an underlying older stellar population component ( cf .",
    "melnick , terlevich & terlevich 2000 ) .",
    "the redshift lower limit was chosen to minimize the effects of local peculiar motions relative to the hubble flow and the upper limit to minimize any possible malmquist bias and to avoid gross cosmological effects . in order to improve the parameters of the @xmath1   relation obtained from previous work , high - resolution echelle spectroscopy for the hii galaxy sample",
    "was performed at 8 meter class telescopes .",
    "we used the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) ( dekker et al . 2000 ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) in chile , and the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) ( noguchi et al . 2002 ; sato et al .",
    "2002 ) at the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) subaru telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the chosen setups provided uves spectra centred at @xmath21 with a slit - width of 2 , giving a spectral resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "the hds spectra were centred at @xmath23 , and with a slit width of 4  the spectral resolution obtained was @xmath24 .    to obtain accurate total @xmath20 fluxes for the hii galaxy sample ,",
    "we performed long slit spectrophotometry at 2-meter class telescopes under photometric conditions and using a slit width ( 8 arcsec ) larger than the upper limit of the hii galaxies size in our sample .",
    "we used the boller & chivens spectrographs at the 2.1 m telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional ( oan ) in san pedro mrtir and at the 2.1 m telescope of the observatorio astrofsico guillermo haro ( oagh ) in cananea , both in mxico .",
    "full details of the sample selection , observations and data reduction and analysis are given elsewhere ( chvez et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . here",
    "we summarize the relevant results regarding the determination of the distance estimator and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath26\\ \\lambda \\lambda 4959,\\ 5007 $ ] line widths were measured fitting single gaussians to the line profiles .",
    "as previously found most hii galaxies show line profiles that are well fitted by single gaussian ( e.g. melnick et al .",
    "1988 , bordalo & telles 2011 ) .",
    "we cleaned the sample by first removing from the original list those hii galaxies with either asymmetric or double / multiple line profile .",
    "we also removed those hii galaxies showing rotation or large photometric errors in their @xmath20 fluxes or with an uncertain reddening correction .",
    "all this reduced the sample from 128 to 69 hii galaxies .",
    "the values of the observed velocity dispersions , @xmath27 , were corrected for thermal ( @xmath28 ) and instrumental ( @xmath29 ) broadening , and the final corrected dispersion was estimated according to : @xmath30    the @xmath31 uncertainties of the velocity dispersion were estimated from multiple observations computing the variance over the repeated measurements ; otherwise as the mean value of the obtained relative errors .",
    "@xmath20 integrated fluxes were measured by fitting a single gaussian to the long slit spectra , while their @xmath31 uncertainties were estimated from the expression ( e.g. tresse et al .",
    "1999 ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean standard deviation per pixel of the continuum on each side of the line , @xmath34 is the spectral dispersion , @xmath35 is the number of pixels covered by the line and @xmath36 is the line equivalent width .",
    "heliocentric redshifts and their uncertainties were obtained from the sdss dr7 and dr8 spectroscopic data when available , otherwise from our echelle data or the spectrophotometric catalog of hii galaxies ( terlevich et al .",
    "the redshifts have been transformed from the heliocentric to the local group reference frames following courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) and corrected for the local bulk flow using the model of basilakos and plionis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 uncertainties were propagated using a montecarlo procedure .    to determine the zero point for the @xmath1  relation , we obtained data from the literature for a sample of 23 gehr in 9 nearby galaxies whose distances have been measured by means of well tested primary distance indicators .",
    "the details of the gehr data will also be given in chvez et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . for these objects , velocity dispersions have been taken from melnick et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , whereas distance moduli have been obtained averaging over the available measurements published after 1995 , selecting only those based on cepheids , rr lyrae , mira variables and eclipsing binaries except for those in ic  2574 and ngc  4236 for which only trgb measurements are available .",
    "the adopted distance moduli ( @xmath37 ) are listed as an inset in figure [ fig : lsgeh2r ] .",
    "the global integrated @xmath20 fluxes and corresponding extinction were obtained from the values reported by melnick et al .",
    "the procedure we use to estimate the hubble constant comprises three steps :    1 .",
    "first we determine the slope of the @xmath2 relation for hii galaxies .",
    "since the slope is independent of @xmath0 we use an arbitary value of @xmath0 to determine luminosities from the observed @xmath20 flux and the hubble distance does not alter the determined slope value . ] .",
    "2 .   we then determine the intercept of the relation from a fit to the ` anchor ' gehr sample , but fixing the slope to that determined in step one , i.e. , that based on hii galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : lsgeh2r ] shows the @xmath1  relation for the gehr sample . the slope of the correlation has been fixed to the value obtained from the hii galaxies sample fitting in ( i ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath1  correlation for the joint sample of gehr and hii galaxies is : @xmath38 has r.m.s .",
    "@xmath39 and is shown in figure [ fig : lsigjoin ] .",
    "finally we determine the value of @xmath0 by minimizing , over a grid of @xmath0 values , the function : @xmath40 ^ 2}{\\delta_{l , i}^2 + \\delta_{\\tilde{l } , i}^2},\\ ] ] + where the summation is over the hii galaxies , @xmath41 are the measured velocity dispersions ( eq .",
    "[ eq : sig ] ) , @xmath42 are the luminosities estimated from the ` distance indicator ' as defined in equation  3 , @xmath43 are their errors propagated from the uncertainties in @xmath16 and the slope and intercept of the relation .",
    "@xmath44 are the luminosities obtained from the measured fluxes and redshifts by using a particular value of @xmath0 in the hubble law to estimate distances , and @xmath45 are the errors in this last estimation of luminosities , propagated from the uncertainties in the fluxes and redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : chsqplot ] shows the resulting @xmath46 for the range of @xmath0 values used , with the solid line being a cubic fit to the points .",
    "the @xmath31 confidence limits of @xmath0 were obtained from the values for which @xmath47 since the fit has only one degree of freedom ( see the inset panel in figure [ fig : chsqplot ] ) .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath0 using the above described procedure is : @xmath48    figure [ fig : hrsh ] shows the hubble diagram for the sample of hii galaxies used for the @xmath0 value determination .",
    "the continuous line shows the redshift run of the distance modulus , obtained from the linear hubble law and the fitted @xmath0 value , whereas the points correspond to the individual hii galaxy distance moduli obtained through the @xmath1  correlation .",
    "the quoted hubble constant uncertainty in equation 5 reflects only the random errors , while systematic errors can also affect the mean value as well as the overall @xmath0 uncertainty .",
    "we have identified as potential sources of systematic errors the following : ( a ) the broadening of the emission lines , being contaminated by a rotational velocity component , ( b ) the internal structure / multiplicity of gehr and hii galaxies , ( c ) stellar winds affecting the line profiles ( d ) internal extinction , ( e ) coherent or peculiar motions affecting the redshifts of nearby hii galaxies , ( f ) the age of gehr and hii galaxies , ( g ) the malmquist bias , ( h ) variations in the imf .",
    "the detailed discussion of these systematics is an important aspect of the @xmath0 determination and will be presented in a future paper ( chvez et al . in preparation ) .",
    "here we briefly discuss these systematics , and the procedures used to minimize them .",
    "\\(a ) and ( b ) to minimize the rotation and multiple component systematic effect we have used in our correlation only those objects with emission line profiles that are gaussian and show no multiple components [ for a discussion see bosch et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ] .",
    "\\(c ) the presence of weak extended ( non - gaussian ) wings in the emission line profiles introduces a small systematic effect .",
    "these weak wings are probably associated with stellar winds .",
    "the resulting effect is that taking into account the wings in the fit the final fwhm tends to be slightly smaller .",
    "this should affect similarly both gehr and hii galaxies .",
    "we estimate that this may introduce a systematic error of about 2 percent in @xmath0 .",
    "\\(d ) the extinction has been always estimated using the balmer decrement method .",
    "we do not expect a sizeable systematic effect associated with this correction .",
    "\\(e ) hii galaxies tend to populate the voids so local peculiar motions should be relatively small .",
    "furthermore , to minimize the effects of coherent bulk flows on the redshifts of the hii galaxies , we imposed a lower radial velocity limit of 3000 km / s . in any case , we have also computed @xmath25 including a local bulk flow correction and found no overall effect .",
    "\\(f ) the age of the gehr and hii galaxies affects their m / l ratio and therefore the zero point of the @xmath1  relationship . to minimize this effect",
    "we have specifically selected objects with @xmath49 .",
    "this guarantees that the age of the star forming region is less than 6 myr , thus minimizing the effect of evolution ( leitherer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we estimate that at most a plausible systematic difference in ages between gehr and hii galaxies may affect @xmath0 at a 2% level .",
    "\\(g ) we have calculated the malmquist bias following the procedure proposed by giraud ( 1987 ) adopting a power law luminosity function , with a slope @xmath50 .",
    "we have obtained a value of @xmath51 at @xmath52 , which we consider as one of the systematic error components .",
    "( h ) the @xmath1  distance estimator relies on the universality of the imf .",
    "any systematic variation in the imf will affect directly the m / l ratio and therefore the slope and zero point of the relation .",
    "the fact that our estimates of the hubble constant are in agreement with those from sn  ia supports the hypothesis of a universal imf .",
    ".systematic error budget on the @xmath0 determination [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : seb ] shows the systematic error budget on the @xmath0 determination .",
    "it is indisputable that in the epoch of intense studies aimed at measuring the dark energy equation of state , it is of paramount importance to minimize the amount of priors needed to successfully complete such a task .",
    "one such prior is the hubble constant @xmath0 and its measurement at the @xmath53 accuracy level has been identified as a necessary prerequisite for putting effective constraints on the dark energy , on neutrino physics and even on tests , at cosmological scales , of general relativity ( see suyu et al .",
    "furthermore , it is highly desirable to have independent determinations of @xmath0 , since this will help understand and control systematic effects that may affect individual methods and tracers of the hubble expansion .",
    "it is within this latter strategy that our current work falls .",
    "we have carried out vlt and subaru observations of a sample of nearby hii galaxies identified in the sdss dr7 catalogue and 2 m class telescopes spectrophotometry , in order to define their @xmath2 correlation , which we use to estimate the value of the hubble constant .",
    "this is achieved by determining the zero - point of the distance indicator using gehr in nearby galaxies , for which accurate independent distance measurements exist ( based on cepheids , rr lyrae , trgb and eclipsing binaries ) .",
    "using our sample of 92 objects ( 69 hii galaxies with @xmath54 and 23 gehr in 9 galaxies with distances determined via primary indicators ) we obtain : + @xmath55(random ) @xmath56 ( systematic ) km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , + in excellent agreement with , and independently confirming , the recent sne  ia - based results of riess et al .",
