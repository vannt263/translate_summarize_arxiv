    "though the grand unification paradigm is around for almost four decades @xcite it still attracts a lot of attention across the high - energy - physics community . unlike many other extensions of the standard model ( sm ) featuring extra symmetries ( global or local ) , grand unified theories ( guts )",
    "tell us implicitly something about the typical scale the extended gauge symmetry such as @xmath5 or @xmath0 is spontaneously broken and , at the same time , the underlying gauge dynamics always leaves its imprints at low energies .",
    "the most prominent of these are namely the heavy topologically stable monopoles created at the gut phase transition in the early universe and the baryon and lepton number non - conservation associated to the gauge and yukawa interactions among quarks and leptons sharing irreducible representations of the gut gauge group .    although it may be fundamentally difficult to get a grip on the gut monopoles that could have been extremely diluted during the inflationary period , baryon and lepton number violating processes such as the proton decay , neutron - antineutron oscillations , neutrinoless double beta decay etc",
    ". can be within reach of upcoming facilities .",
    "in particular , proton instability - if observed - would provide a smoking - gun signal of grand unification and as such it has been searched for for decades by many dedicated experiments . among these , the best sensitivity is provided by large - volume water erenkov detectors ( such as , e.g. , imb , kamiokande , super - kamiokande ) where the proton decay searches naturally support neutrino physics activities .",
    "it is also likely that in the near future these `` classical '' experiments will be further complemented by large liquid argon detectors ( e.g. glacier , lartpc ) whose tracking properties and , in particular , a very good particle discrimination potential , can improve substantially the existing proton lifetime limits , especially for the decay modes with kaons in the final state .",
    "reaching a mega - ton scale ( as assumed in the recent proposals such as hyper - kamiokande ) is , however , a costly enterprise ; a robust proton lifetime prediction including , optimally , branching fractions into at least the leading modes at a factor - of - few level of precision is vital to make a real physics case .    from the theory point of view",
    ", reaching such a high level of accuracy within a specific gut is often an enormous challenge .",
    "this has to do namely with the fact that , unlike the gauge structure dictated solely by the shape of the relevant gauge group the form of the higgs sector is not derived from first principles and as such it is mainly subject to experimental ( and often also aesthetic ) constraints . since , at the same time , it supplies the key ingredients entering the proton lifetime calculation , namely , the symmetry breaking pattern constraining the position of the gut scale and the yukawa interactions governing the flavour structure of the relevant feynman diagrams , it becomes one of the central issues of the whole gut programme . in that respect ,",
    "the quality of any such prediction is strongly correlated with the `` simplicity '' of a given gut model ; on the other hand , oversimplified settings are often trivially incompatible with the existing electroweak and flavour data .",
    "remarkably enough , the borderline between `` trivially wrong '' and `` too complicated to be predictive '' models is rather thin and there are only several settings which historically qualified as `` truly minimal '' guts .",

    "moreover , both fail on the flavour side as they do not accommodate massive neutrinos .",
    "there are several ways out advocated in the existing literature : giving up renormalizability the proton lifetime in the minimal supersymmetric @xmath5 can be , at least in principle , prolonged to acceptable values @xcite .",
    "on a similar footing , one can , e.g. , add extra higgs representations such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 and/or extra matter fields such as @xmath9 in attempt to make the flavour structure of the model more realistic ( giving masses to neutrinos and , at the same time , smearing the notorious down - quark and charged - lepton mass degeneracy ) . at the same time , accidentally light multiplets can restore the gauge coupling unification even in the non - supersymmetric scenario .",
    "for more detail , an interested reader is deferred namely to the original works @xcite and references therein .",
    "unfortunately , these models in practice still rely on a certain ( though limited ) set of effective operators so their predictive power is not very clear .",

    "though this setting was successful in accommodating all the flavour data and even provided an interesting argument in favour of a relatively large leptonic 1 - 3 mixing angle ( which typically fell within the range reported by the recent first direct measurements by double - chooz  @xcite , daya - bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite ) , the `` minimal susy gut '' did not pass the full consistency tests @xcite revealing a strong tension between phenomenological bounds on the absolute neutrino masses and the gauge unification and proton decay constraints .

    "alternatively  @xcite , one can attempt to push the @xmath3 breaking scale up to the required @xmath4 gev domain by `` populating '' the desert by a suitable multiplet which can take over the role of a `` non - susy running helper '' and , thus , lift the usual constraints the gauge unification studies  @xcite imposed on the @xmath3 sector ( i.e. , on the @xmath3-breaking higgs multiplet and the relevant gauge boson ) .",
    "this is the scenario we shall focus on here .",
    "in a full theory , pushing a chosen multiplet away from its natural scale does not need to be entirely trivial .",
    "indeed , the entire scalar spectrum is driven by a limited number of parameters that must conspire in order to pull the desired multiplet s mass down to the gut desert .",

    "the scalar spectrum resulting from the minimization of @xmath25 is given in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the scalar potential ( [ potential ] ) is driven in total by 14 real parameters and 2 phases .",
    "let us also recall that there are three sm singlet vevs residing in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 sub - multiplets of @xmath8 and in the @xmath28 component of @xmath11 where the quantum numbers correspond to the @xmath29 subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "the minimization conditions constrain three combinations of the parameters above ( we choose @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . since , however , @xmath33 does not enter the scalar masses at all and @xmath34 enters only as @xmath35 one is in general left with just 10 real numbers parametrizing the scalar spectrum should in general pop up in the diagonalization matrices . ]",
    ". finally , an attempt to reconcile the seesaw scale with the light neutrino mass limits by pushing one extra scalar into the desert amounts to one ( and only one ! ) more fine - tuning , so for each choice of the three vevs constrained by gauge unification and proton decay , one is left with only 9 independent real parameters , cf .",
    "table  [ tablesampleparameters ] .      in connection to this , let us recall that the predictive power of the minimal susy @xmath0 was related mainly the fact that its sm vacuum manifold was parametrized by only two real numbers  @xcite . in this respect , the minimal non - susy @xmath0 scenario seems to be in a much worse shape .",
    "nevertheless , it is rather premature to claim that the model is free of any interesting and robust low - energy predictions . indeed",
    ", it is clear that not all configurations of the 9 independent parameters correspond to stable vacua of the theory .",
    "thus , the real predictive power of the model under consideration remains unclear and should be studied in detail in convolution with all the other available phenomenology constraints ( i.e. , flavour structure , proton lifetime , big - bang nucleosynthesis ) . in this respect",
    "one should also not forget about the need for an extra @xmath17 in the higgs sector in order to make the yukawa structure potentially realistic . nevertheless ,",
    "since @xmath17 does not participate at the high - scale symmetry breaking the vacuum stability considerations remain unaffected .",
    "however , such a complete analysis , though highly desirable , was beyond the scope of the study  @xcite and will be elaborated elsewhere . here",
    "we shall focus solely on the first step in the desired direction , i.e. , on the identification of the settings in which the seesaw scale falls into the @xmath4  gev ballpark and , hence , provides the best chance to accommodate the light neutrino masses within the relevant experimental limits .        in doing so , one has to address the question of the radiative stabilization of the physically interesting vacua of the current model .",
    "unlike in the @xmath36 case that has been worked out in great detail in reference  @xcite , the full - fledged calculation of the one - loop effective potential is very difficult with @xmath19 in the higgs sector due to the higher number and complexity of the @xmath37-invariants in the tree - level potential above .",
    "nevertheless , as it was argued in  @xcite it is ( at least for the time being ) sufficient to focus at the most universal scalar one - loop correction , namely , at the leading non - logarithmic @xmath0-invariant @xmath38 term which can be evaluated by a simple diagrammatic calculation . indeed ,",
    "as it yields a positive correction to all scalar masses , it should be enough to regularize the key tachyonic instabilities of the tree - level spectrum invariant piece can be viewed as a minimal way to stabilize the tachyons .",
    "] , c.f .",
    "it is not difficult to see that such leading scalar - loop induced non - logarithmic corrections come from tadpole type of diagrams and that the @xmath38-proportional non - logarithmic term emerges only through the renormalization of the stationary conditions for the @xmath8 vevs .",
    "diagrammatically , they correspond to the one - loop correction to the one - point function of @xmath8 of the form @xmath39{tau_graph - schematic}}\\ni \\parbox{2.6cm}{\\includegraphics[width=2.6cm]{tau_graph-1vev}}+ \\text{higher order terms}\\ ] ] where the `` higher order terms '' denote diagrams with higher number of vev insertions ( via the @xmath40-vertex ) . given the @xmath0 structure of the relevant @xmath40-term in  ( [ potential ] ) the universal mass shift due to this class of graphs reads @xmath41 where the symbol `` logs '' denotes all the logarithmic corrections that are minimized at the gut scale .      without a detailed information about the flavour structure of a specific model",
    "the best one can do about the @xmath42 proton decay limits is to focus on the `` universal '' gauge transitions parametrized ( in the current basis ) by the unified gauge coupling and the gut breaking scale @xmath43 and assume @xmath44 entries of the unitary matrices corresponding to the rotations from the current to the mass bases ; in such a case the position of the gauge unification point translates directly to the proton lifetime .",
    "for that , we shall impose namely the latest ( 2011 ) super - kamiokande limit  @xcite : @xmath45 and , for sake of illustration , a couple of assumed future sensitivity limits that hyper - kamiokande ( hk )  @xcite should reach by 2025 and 2040 : @xmath46 on the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) side , we require that any accidentally light scalar coupled to the sm matter decays well before the bbn phase of the early universe evolution in order to prevent any distortion of the successful standard bbn picture  @xcite",
    ". we do not expect any trouble here because all the candidate multiplets identified in  @xcite come from @xmath11 whose renormalizable yukawa coupling to the sm matter are assumed to be non - negligible .

    "one should also note that the results obtained in  @xcite are subject to several sources of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "in particular , given the need for a radiative stabilization of the tree - level tachyons , a full - fledged two - loop renormalization group analysis is highly desirable . in this respect ,",
    "the one - loop running performed in  @xcite should be interpreted as an indication of viability rather than a full - fledged analysis ; nevertheless , even such a simplified picture should account for all the qualitative features of the full two - loop approach and , as such , it can be viewed as a good first approximation . for a more detailed discussion an interested reader",
