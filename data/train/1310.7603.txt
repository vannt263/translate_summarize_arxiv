    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have provided cosmologists with a wealth of information about our early universe . on its own , and especially in concert with data from complementary probes , cmb observations",
    "have lead to increasingly tight constraints on the inferred values of cosmological parameters , and have allowed us to to distinguish among various models of our universe .",
    "this has resulted in a standard cosmological model : inflationary flat lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) .    despite its great successes ,",
    "@xmath1cdm has had difficulty explaining certain features in the cmb that were initially characterized by the _ cosmic background explorer s differential microwave radiometer ( cobe - dmr ) _ @xcite or using _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _",
    "observations @xcite and recently confirmed @xcite with the first release of temperature data from the _ planck _ satellite .",
    "these features are predominantly in the large - angle , or low ( @xmath4 ) multipole , regime .",
    "the anomalies include an ecliptic north - south hemispherical asymmetry @xcite , the alignment of the quadrupole and octopole patterns with one another @xcite , with the ecliptic @xcite and with the cosmological dipole @xcite , and low variance across the sky @xcite . a full list as well as comparison to _ wmap _ observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "another large - angle anomaly , namely the lack of correlation on the cmb sky at angles larger than about @xmath0 , currently has no compelling explanation .",
    "the importance of this feature has been outlined in papers over the last several years  @xcite . thus far , this anomaly has been observed only in the temperature auto correlation function .",
    "there has been some suggestion that it is merely a statistical fluke ( which we call the fluke hypothesis , or the null hypothesis because it is just standard cosmology informed by the experimental data ) especially since it was only noted and characterized _ a posteriori_. moreover , it will be difficult to improve on the current statistical significance purely through further observation of the temperature correlations because of cosmic variance and because the measurements are statistics limited .",
    "the use of temperature data exclusively is due to to a lack of high signal - to - noise full - sky maps of other cosmological quantities , such as polarization and lensing potential . with the highly anticipated upcoming release of the _ planck _ polarization map as well as several upcoming lensing experiments",
    ", cosmologists will have information on large - angle correlation functions beyond just microwave temperature data . recently",
    "the ability for a temperature-@xmath5 polarization cross correlation to test the fluke hypothesis was investigated  @xcite .",
    "the results of that work showed that there was a possibility for @xmath6 correlations to rule out the null hypothesis , but that it would not necessarily be a definitive test . in this work",
    "we will investigate the possibility for a cross correlation between temperature and cmb lensing potential to provide a test of the statistical fluke hypothesis as well as a consistency check for observations .",
    "we provide predictions for the distribution of a standard statistic used in two - point correlation function analysis , @xmath7 , as well as define an optimal , _ a priori _",
    "statistic for use with temperature - lensing cross correlations .",
    "while in this paper we present results comparing two particular models  unconstrained and constrained @xmath1cdm  we use a generic prescription for optimization and for determining the viablity of an @xmath7-like statistic",
    ". this analysis can be repeated for any set of models as long as one knows how to produce realizations within that framework .",
    "this reason in particular was a driving force in the choice of unconstrained @xmath1cdm for our comparison model , as generating realizations is straightforward . with the particular choice of @xmath8 correlations , the discriminating power of the @xmath9 statistic will depend on how a particular model suppresses the @xmath10 term in the correlation , as this is the piece that dominates the signal , unlike @xmath11 correlations",
    "however , this analysis can _ always _ be carried out such that the @xmath7-like statistic can be optimized _ a priori _ for correlations between cosmological data sets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ background ]",
    "we will give the theoretical background for cmb two - point correlation function analysis , in sec .",
    "[ constrained ] we will describe how we generate constrained @xmath1cdm realizations , in sec .",
    "[ s12 ] we will outline our general prescription for calculating statistics , in sec .  [ results ] we will present our results for the distributions of the statistic for two models ( constrained and unconstrained @xmath1cdm ) , and finally in sec .  [ conclusions ] we will summarize and state our conclusions .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function for the cmb temperature is calculated by taking an ensemble average of the temperature fluctuations in different directions : @xmath12 since we are not able to compute the ensemble average in practice , we instead calculate @xmath13 , a sky average over the angular separation . in general ,",
    "any @xmath14 can be expanded in a legendre series , which we write as @xmath15 where the @xmath16 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ theta_ell ] are the measured power spectrum values . on a full sky",
    ", the coefficients @xmath16 obtained from the estimator @xmath17 where the @xmath18 are the usual spherial harmonic coefficients of a map , are identical to the @xmath16 in eq .",
    "[ theta_ell ] .",
    "computationally it is more efficient to use the relations  ( [ theta_ell ] ) and ( [ powerspectrum ] ) than to directly correlate pairs of pixels on the observed cmb sky .    the two - point function from the _ cobe - dmr _",
    "s fourth - year data release @xcite highlighted a lack of temperature auto - correlations for angular separations larger than 60 degrees .",
    "wmap _ first - year data release @xcite first quantified this feature using an ( _ a posteriori _ ) statistic that neatly captured the simple observation that @xmath14 nearly vanished at large angles @xmath19 ^ 2.\\ ] ] we generalize this to @xmath20 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 can be any combination of cosmological quantities for which @xmath22 can be calculated .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "team calculated @xmath23 on the most reliable part of the sky  that outside the galactic plane  and found it to be @xmath24 , much smaller than the expected @xmath1cdm value of @xmath25 .",
    "they remarked : ` for our @xmath1cdm markov chains@xmath26only 0.15% of the simulations have lower values of s. '    the simplest ( and perhaps leading ) explanation for this anomaly is that it is just a statistical fluke within completely canonical @xmath1cdm . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to define _ a priori _ a statistic that can be used with future data to test the fluke hypothesis .",
    "we therefore need to find an independent cross correlation that would respond to the same statistical fluctuations as the temperature two - point function . to this end",
    "we focus on the lensing of the cmb , and construct the cross correlation , @xmath27 , between the cmb temperature @xmath28 and the cmb lensing potential @xmath29 . since both derive from the gravitational potential @xmath30",
    ", we expect that if statistical fluctuations generated by primordial physics in @xmath30 caused the lack of large - angle temperature auto - correlation , then those statistical fluctuations would also imprint themselves in a new , distinct way on @xmath27 .",
    "since we know that at large angles the cmb signal is dominated by the sachs - wolfe ( sw ) and integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) contributions , we can write @xmath31 and can describe @xmath32 as a correlation of these two terms only .",
    "the sw and isw pieces of the primordial temperature fluctions in terms of the metric potential , @xmath30 , are @xmath33 and @xmath34 which allows us to write @xmath32 in terms of correlations of @xmath30 as @xmath35    similarly , we can write the cmb lensing potential @xmath29 in terms of the metric potential , @xmath36 which allows us to write an expression for the two - point function of the cmb temperature and lensing field : @xmath37 where computations to find @xmath27 from data will use sky averages rather than ensemble averages .    from ( [ eqn : ctphi ] ) , we see that the lensing field also accesses the information encoded in @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if the anomalous absence of large - angle correlations in @xmath32 is due to statistical fluctuations , then it should be present in a predictable way in the @xmath27 cross correlation .",
    "it should be noted , however , that @xmath27 traces the same physics in a different way  the terms eq .",
    "[ eqn : ctphi ] do not exactly match the sw and isw terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : ctt ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 is dominated by the isw-@xmath29 term , meaning the behavior of the two - point cross correlation is dominated by physics on the interior of our hubble volume , whereas @xmath32 has its largest contribution from the sw - sw term and is therefore dominated by physics at the last scattering surface .",
    "this makes @xmath27 a complementary probe into the nature of the lack of correlation in @xmath32 at large angles .",
    "the way that the cross correlation of the temperature and lensing fields will be affected depends on the underlying details contained in the metric potential .",
    "this means that predictions of how @xmath38 will be affected by new physics can only occur after choosing a particular model .",
    "consequently , absent a specific alternative model we can not construct a statistic that fits well into a bayesian statistical approach and differentiates between the fluke hypothesis and all other models generically .",
    "the approach we therefore take is to use @xmath1cdm ( without the constraints imposed by the fluke hypothesis ) as the comparison model for its predictions of the statistical properties of @xmath38 and then construct as @xmath39-like statistic that optimizes the ability to select between the fluke hypothesis and this comparison model .",
    "the statistic we propose can thus be used to falsify the prediction of the fluke hypothesis .",
    "we know that we live in a universe with a particular angular power spectrum of the temperature , @xmath40 , and a particular value of @xmath41 , and we must see what including this as a prior constraint on the allowed realizations of @xmath1cdm does to the probability distribution of values of our target statistic .    it is well known how to create realizations of ordinary @xmath1cdm with a fixed set of parameters .",
    "it is more unusual to create constrained realizations of @xmath1cdm  ones that reproduce , within the measurement errors , the angular power spectrum of the observed sky , and with both a full sky and a cut sky @xmath41 no larger than those of the observed sky . a detailed description of how create constrained realizations is contained in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we treat the observational errors in the _",
    "wmap_-reported @xmath40 as gaussian distributed and generate many random @xmath40 from gaussian distributions centred on the _ wmap_-reported values , and correct this realization for the slight correlation induced on partial skies .",
    "the resulting sky realization is guaranteed to have a full - sky @xmath23 consistent with the small value in the full - sky _ wmap _ ilc map .",
    "we only keep realizations with an @xmath23 less than the observed cut - sky calculated value ( @xmath42 for _ wmap_-7 and @xmath43 for _",
    "wmap_-9 ) for analysis .    with a set of @xmath44 such constrained temperature realizations , @xmath45",
    ", we can compute the corresponding set of constrained lensing potential realizations , @xmath46 .",
    "this is done using standard techniques for generating correlated random variables using the healpix package@xcite and is reviewed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the required input spectra @xmath47 and @xmath48 were generated with@xcite .",
    "a full - sky analysis of the cmb relies on a reconstruction of the fluctuations behind the galactic cut .",
    "we instead use the cut - sky measured value as a threshold to avoid any bias that the reconstruction might induce .",
    "we emphasize that no attempt is made ( nor is any necessary ) to argue that the cut - sky statistic is a better estimator of the value of some full - sky version of the statistic on the full - sky ( if we could measure it reliably ) or on the ensemble .",
    "the cut - sky statistic need only be taken at face value as a precise prescription for something that can be calculated from the observable sky . calculating @xmath7 with partial sky data",
    "has a well defined procedure ",
    "statistics are just calculated using pseudo-@xmath16s without reference to any full sky estimators .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this can be found in  @xcite .",
    "once we have a set of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we can calculate @xmath39 as above ( [ s12eq ] ) .",
    "however , instead of using @xmath14 directly , we calculate the statistic using @xmath16s : @xmath50 ^ 2     = \\sum_{\\ell=2}^{\\ell_{\\mathrm max } } c_{\\ell}^{xy } { i}_{\\ell\\ell ' } c_{\\ell'}^{xy}.\\ ] ] in computing eq .",

    "we then determine the fraction of the values in the @xmath58 distribution for the unconstrained ensemble that are _ larger _ than the @xmath57 per cent constrained value .",
    "the higher the percentile , the better @xmath56 is at discriminating between the constrained and unconstrained models .",
    "we repeat the analysis for @xmath59-percentile .",
    "we choose two different confidence levels for analysis here to show that optimization will lead to different @xmath60 ranges . the confidence level and corresponding per centage for optimization",
    "should always be chosen before any analysis on a particular data set is carried out .",
    "this process was performed using reported @xmath61 and corresponding error bars from both _",

    "in light of the new data from _ planck _ , large - angle anomalies have been gaining more traction in the community as potential evidence of interesting primordial physics that deviates from the widely accepted @xmath1cdm paradigm . in particular , the observed lack of temperature - temperature correlations at angles larger than @xmath0 has been characterized by the @xmath23 statistic , and the measured value has shown to occur in less than @xmath79 per cent of standard @xmath1cdm realizations on a 9-year kq85 masked sky  @xcite . since @xmath23 was an _ a posteriori _ choice of a statistic after seeing the shape of the two - point function from the _ wmap _ data , the possibility that our universe happens to just be a statistical fluke has been advocated .",
    "we wish to test this hypothesis by calculating statistics for a different correlation function whose distribution would be expected to be markedly altered ( compared to normal ) in realizations of @xmath1cdm that reproduce the observed small @xmath41 . for this purpose we have used the cross - correlation between temperature and lensing potential @xmath29 as an _ a priori _ test of the null hypothesis .",
    "we have calculated the distribution of the @xmath80 statistic for @xmath75 realizations of unconstrained @xmath1cdm with the _ wmap _ 7 and _ wmap _ 9 best - fitting cosmological parameters , as well as a similar number of realizations constrained to have a value for @xmath23 no larger than the observed value , and found no significant difference between results calculated from each data set despite changes to the reported central values and error bars .",

    "however , because the improvement over the @xmath80 statistic is modest , and because @xmath86 is optimized to select between constrained @xmath1cdm and unconstrained @xmath1cdm , simplicity argues for using @xmath80 to parallel previous analysis of @xmath61 .    the outlined procedure for assessing the discriminating power of the @xmath8 cross - correlation statistics",

    "clearly , some model comparisons will provide statistics from @xmath8 that are more useful than others .",
    "in particular , since the @xmath29 field is dominated by effects inside the last - scattering surface , it has a large correlation with @xmath87 .",

    "regardless , @xmath8 correlations will provide an important consistency check for the data , as the large @xmath10 contribution is a probe of physics on the interior of our hubble volume .",
    "it is therefore complimentary to the @xmath11 signal which is largely comprised of effects at the last - scattering surface .",
    "the @xmath9 statistic is not particularly helpful for testing a hypothesis that the underlying gravitational potential fluctuations lack correlations on scales larger than some comoving scale subtending @xmath0 at the redshift of last scattering .",
    "any suppression in @xmath88 that gives rise to the observed @xmath11 spectrum would _ not _ have any significant effect on the shape of @xmath27 compared to @xmath1cdm .",
    "this fact is precisely due to the large @xmath10 term .",
    "other cross correlations may prove to be more fruitful .",
    "for example , 21 centimeter emission correlated with temperature fluctuations will partially mitigate the large @xmath10 problem .",
    "the 21 centimeter emission spectrum comes to us from localized region of redshift space , and does not have a component which is an integral along the line of sight .",

    ", we will show how viable this cross correlation will be for testing the null hypothesis , as well as provide predictions for the shape of @xmath89 with an imposed cutoff .    a related calculation @xcite examined the implications of the fluke hypothesis for the temperature - polarization angular correlation function , in particular the correlation of temperature with the stokes @xmath5 parameter , @xmath90 .",
    "this statistic excludes the fluke hypothesis at 99.9 per cent c.l . for 26 per cent of realizations of unconstrained @xmath1cdm , or at 99 per cent c.l . for 39 per cent of such realizations .    in summary",
    ", the temperature auto - correlation of the cmb sky behaves oddly at large angular separations .",
    "no satisfactory current theory explains this anomaly , and so the leading explanation is that it is a statistical fluke . in the absence of specific models to compare directly with @xmath1cdm ,",

    "<S> this feature arises as a random occurrence within the standard @xmath1cdm cosmological model less than @xmath2 per cent of the time , but so far no other compelling theory to explain this observation has been proposed . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the theoretical cross - correlation function between microwave background temperature and the gravitational lensing potential of the microwave background , which in contrast to the temperature correlation function depends strongly on gravitational potential fluctuations interior to our hubble volume . </S>",
    "<S> for standard @xmath1cdm cosmology , we generate random sky realizations of the microwave temperature and gravitational lensing , subject to the constraint that the temperature correlation function matches observations , and compare with random skies lacking this constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of large - angle temperature - lensing correlation functions in these two cases is different , and the two cases can be clearly distinguished in around @xmath3 per cent of model realizations . </S>",
    "<S> we present an _ a priori _ procedure for using similar large - angle correlations between other types of data , to determine whether the lack of large - angle correlations is a statistical fluke or points to a shortcoming of the standard cosmological model . </S>"
