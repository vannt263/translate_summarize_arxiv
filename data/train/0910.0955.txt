    "cooperation is observed at many levels of biological organization .",
    "the evolution of cooperation in these systems has been a subject of extensive debate and studies@xcite .",
    "primarily , five different mechanisms have been proposed to explain how natural selection lead to cooperative behavior .",
    "they are kin selection , group selection , direct or indirect reciprocity and network reciprocity @xcite .",
    "kin selection explains the cooperation between genetically close organisms as a tendency to help reproductive success of the relatives even at a cost to themselves @xcite .",
    "cooperation may evolve not only on individuals level but also in groups .",
    "thus , a group of cooperators are more likely to survive and grow than group of defectors .",
    "however , some authors believe that , the kin selection models are not different from the group selection models @xcite . cooperation is also observed between organisms who are not genetically close .",
    "reciprocal altruism is a possible mechanism to explain the cooperation between such agents @xcite .",
    "emergence of sustained cooperation when agents have an incentive to cheat as well as tension of being defected @xcite , has been a topic of extensive investigation . in this case",
    ", the benefit is extended to another organism in the hope that it will be reciprocated in future and this strategy is reversed if the act is not reciprocated . sustaining such strategy is more likely in an iterated or spatial game theoretical model .",
    "we would like to mention that the cooperation is not always direct .",
    "sometimes we help strangers , and there is no possibility for direct reciprocation .",
    "we would like to also mention that altruism is still an open problem .    among various attempts at constructing a theory of cooperation",
    ", game theoretical models have played an important role @xcite .",
    "in particular , prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) has emerged as a paradigm for the explanation of cooperative behavior among selfish individuals @xcite .",
    "this kind of cooperative behavior observed in real life in systems ranging from biological to economic and social systems @xcite .",
    "pd has now become a standard model to explain cooperation in these systems @xcite . in its original form",
    ", pd describes the pairwise interaction between two players .",
    "the player either cooperates(@xmath2 ) or defects(@xmath3 ) at any confrontation . if both players choose to cooperate ( defect ) , they get a pay - off of magnitude @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) each ; if one(@xmath3 ) chooses to defect , while the other(@xmath2 ) chooses to cooperate , the defector gets the biggest pay - off @xmath6 , while the other gets @xmath7 . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , total reward for both players is higher if they cooperate . however , an individual has better payoff if he defects while the other player cooperates .",
    "thus the best choice for any player is to defect irrespective of the opponent s choice if the game played for one round .",
    "however , on a two - dimensional lattice , it was found that a fraction of players keep cooperating with their neighbors with repeated interaction .",
    "_ thus , with repeated interactions and spatial structure , it was found that it is possible to have mixed state where clusters of cooperators coexist with defectors .",
    "_ we must mention that recently other spatial structures have also received a fair share of attention @xcite .    in the context of ecology , nowak and may simulated pd game with choice of parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "( some authors called this game weak dilemma when @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , nowak and may @xcite found that their qualitative results does not change when @xmath15 , at least for small absolute values of @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 .",
    "hence , we work with @xmath14 in this paper . we have studied the case when @xmath17 and @xmath18 to demonstrate that our main results do not change for @xmath15 . )",
    "they believe that , with this choice of parameters most of the interesting behavior is reproduced .",
    "they studied pd on a two dimensional array with synchronous updating and explored the asymptotic behavior for various values of the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "players interact with their local neighbors through simple deterministic rules and have no memory of past @xcite .",
    "this explanation was debated and robustness of the conclusions was studied under several perturbations of the model .",
    "et al . _ as well as huberman and glance studied the system under introduction of asynchronicity @xcite .",
    "mukherji et al .",
    "investigated if cooperation can survive in the spatial pd in the presence of noise in general .",
    "they considered some more stochastic variants of this system .",
    "other modifications by mukherji _",
    "_ were random introduction of cooperators and defectors at any site and spontaneous conversion of cooperators into defectors with some probability @xcite .",
    "et al . _ replied stating that , their results are robust with respect to these modifications . if one studies the entire parameter regime , cooperation is found to persist in the system even in presence of high values of noise @xcite .",
    "we will make a detaied study of one of the cases studied by mukherji _",
    "_ in which cooperators turn into defector spontaneously with probability @xmath0 .",
    "we call this model as model stochastic prisoner s dilemma ( permanent ) ( abbreviated as spd(p ) ) .",
    "_ simulated spd(p ) on a @xmath20 lattice , for @xmath21 generations with an initial condition of @xmath22 cooperators .",
    "they found that , the density of cooperators quickly decreases with @xmath0 and above certain value of @xmath0 all agents become defor increase up to point where all players become defector@xcite .",
    "this variant was criticized by nowak _",
    "_ as ` this assumption is well chosen for attempting to eliminate cooperators ' @xcite .",
    "hence , we will study one more variant , stochastic prisoner s dilemma ( temporary ) ( spd(t ) ) . in this model",
    ", each cooperator turns into defector _",
    "temporarily _ with probability @xmath0 and returns to being cooperator at the next time step . in both models ,",
    "each agent imitate the best ( unconditional imitation ) strategy of neighboring agents in last time - step .    in this paper",
    ", we make an extensive study of spd(p ) and spd(t ) from the viewpoint of dynamic phase transition . in both cases ,",
    "only one absorbing state is possible , namely , in which all players choose to defect at all times .",
    "coexistence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 is considered as active phase or fluctuating phase . for large values of noise @xmath0 , we observe a transition from coexistence state to an all - defector state .",
    "this kind of phase transition to absorbing state has attracted much attention recently @xcite .",
    "we can study this phase transition borrowing tools used extensively for studies in equilibrium systems , we find whether or not transition is continuous and find the several critical exponents .",
    "we also find the scaling functions which give a better idea of universality . at the basic level , the critical exponents allow us to classify the system in different universality classes .",
    "the concept of the universality is one of the most important concepts in study of phase transitions .",
    "it allows us to group different systems to small number of classes and lets us know the essential and not so essential details of the systems .",
    "it is generically believed that , all the continuous phase transitions from fluctuating phase to a single absorbing state are in the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite .",
    "( most system with multiple absorbing state also fall in the dp class @xcite . ) however , under some additional conditions , the systems with absorbing state may not fall under the dp class .",
    "the other well known universality class for such systems are parity conserving class @xcite , the pair contact process with diffusion @xcite , the conserved lattice gas @xcite and manna class @xcite .",
    "these systems has been studied extensively in past two decades @xcite .",
    "the spd(p ) and spd(t ) have an unique absorbing state , no obvious conservation laws , so we expect them to be in the dp universality class .",
    "we must mention that , phase transition to dp class has been observed in the pd game in a previous studies @xcite . however , there are a few differences between these works and the present one .",
    "the updating rule in these works was different from the updating rule suggested by nowak and may .",
    "most of earlier studies computed only the static exponent @xmath23 . in this",
    "work , we have made exhaustive and systematic simulations and found all the three independent exponents of dp class .",
    "( in fact , we also find the fourth exponent and explicitly demonstrate time reversal symmetry . )",
    "qualitatively , we have only one possible absorbing state in this system unlike previous studies where there are two absorbing states are possible .",
    "thus there is a stronger ground for janssen and grassberger s , @xcite conjecture to hold in this case . in the other hand",
    ", these transitions could be discontinuous .",
    "in fact , experimentally discontinuous transitions are observed often and unfortunately there are no clear thumb rules on when the transition is continuous and when it is not except in cases where mean field theory is applicable @xcite .",
    "however , the transition in our case is clearly continuous .    in this paper",
    ", we make a complete study of transition to absorbing state of the above two models and we find that they are indeed in dp class .",
    "furthermore , we study persistence in these systems .",
    "recently , there have been several studies on persistence in dynamic phase transitions .",
    "they lead to nontrivial exponents which have no obvious relation with other critical exponents in the system since persistence takes into account time correlations of arbitrary order .",
    "we study local persistence in these two models and determine the value of the local persistence exponent .",
    "our studies further support the fact that the conjecture of superuniversality of the exponent @xcite made in initial studies is not true .",
    "( superuniversality means having an exponent which is independent of dimension . ) in fact , the exponent is not even universal in the sense that different models in same universality class in same dimension yield widely different exponents .",
    "the exponents obtained by us are much larger than ones obtained in previous studies for some other systems belonging to dp class . with systematic numerical studies",
    ", we will demonstrate that the two variants studied by us are unambiguously in dp universality class .",
    "however , they show different persistence exponents .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected since then persistence exponent probes a full non - markovian evolution of the system and is one of the least universal exponents .",
    "the dependence of persistence exponent on detailed dynamics of the system has been observed previously in other systems such as spin systems @xcite .",
    "our results further demonstrate that , the persistence exponent is very much dependent on the dynamics and having the same exponent in two different systems could simply be a coincidence .",
    "we consider evolutionary pd game on the two dimensional lattice of size @xmath24 .",
    "each lattice site can take only two values @xmath25 ( defector ) or @xmath26 ( cooperator ) .",
    "we fix boundary condition and players have no memory of the past .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we study the model under variation of @xmath11 .",
    "each player @xmath29 interacts with his eight nearest neighbors ( moore neighbors ) and himself . the total pay - off of any player @xmath30 is the sum of the pay - offs from all nine interactions ( with neighbors and self ) .",
    "in each monte carlo step , each player is allowed to update his strategy by adopting the strategy of the most successful neighbor . in spd(p ) , after each monte carlo step , each cooperator may choose to change his state to defector state with probability @xmath0 . in spd(t ) , each cooperator defects with his neighbors with probability @xmath0 , but unlike spd(p ) , returns to cooperator status in the next time step even if temporary defection has delivered him a good payoff .",
    "if his payoff is lesser than any agent in the neighborhood ( except himself ) , he mimics that neighbor s strategy _ in previous timestep_. if the successful neighbor has cooperated ( defected ) in previous time step , he becomes cooperator ( defector ) . in both cases , for @xmath31",
    "we recover the pd on the two dimensional lattice where agents are either pure cooperators or pure defectors .",
    "furthermore , in both cases , the only possible absorbing state is an all - defector state for any value of @xmath32 ( we have also checked that , both models still show dp phase transition if we make @xmath15 at least when @xmath33 . )    the order parameter in this case is the density of cooperators(active ) sites @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total number of a lattice sites and @xmath36 denotes to the ensemble average .",
    "clearly , this parameter has a nonzero value in the mixed state while it is zero in an all - defector state . for both models spd(p ) and spd(t ) , we plot a phase diagram for the asymptotic states in the phase space @xmath37 .",
    "we explore the range @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the two parameters .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig.1 . as we can see , the system has two different phase all defector phase ( absorbing phase ) and mixed phase ( active phase ) . for fixed value of @xmath19 , we vary @xmath0 and study the nature of phase transition in the system .    schematic phase diagram of ( a ) spd(p ) and ( b ) spd(t ) when @xmath14 .",
