    "in a family of superconductors in which the transition temperature @xmath1 varies sensitively according to the lattice structure and/or the constituent elements , it is imperative to extract parameters that are systematically correlated with @xmath1 . for the high-@xmath1 cuprates in particular ,",
    "_ have shown that there is a striking correlation between the experimentally observed @xmath1 and the fermi - surface warping [ see fig.[fig1](b ) ] [ ] .",
    "namely , they have obtained single - orbital tight - binding models for various cuprates to estimate the ratio `` @xmath3 '' between the nearest and second - nearest - neighbor hoppings , which is a measure of the warping of the fermi surface .",
    "plotting the experimental @xmath1 against the theoretically evaluated @xmath3 , they noticed that @xmath1 empirically increases with the fermi surface warping .",
    "the trend for higher @xmath1 for more degraded nesting is rather puzzling , since , while there have been some approaches for explaining the trend @xcite , fluctuation exchange ( flex)@xcite as well as dynamical cluster approximation studies@xcite have shown that the fermi surface warping and @xmath1 should theoretically be _",
    "anti_-correlated when the cu-@xmath4 orbital ( plus the hybridized oxygen @xmath5 orbitals ) alone is taken into account in the models . in order to resolve this puzzle ,",
    "some of the present authors have previously introduced a two - orbital model that explicitly considers the @xmath2 wannier orbital on top of the @xmath4@xcite .",
    "in fact , there has been a long history of the study on possible importance of the @xmath2 orbital and/or the apical oxygen@xcite . in refs .",
    ", we showed that @xmath6 , the level offset between @xmath4 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals , dominates both of the warping of the fermi surface and @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown , focusing on the single - layer cuprates , that la@xmath7cuo@xmath8 has , despite a better - nested fermi surface , a lower @xmath1 than those in hgba@xmath7cuo@xmath8 , tl@xmath7ba@xmath7cuo@xmath9 , and bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cuo@xmath9 due to a strong @xmath2 orbital mixture on the fermi surface that degrades @xmath1 . however , among the above mentioned four single - layer cuprates , only la@xmath7cuo@xmath8 has a small @xmath6 ( i.e. , a strong @xmath2 mixture ) , so that we are still in need of a convincing study to clarify whether @xmath6 indeed controls @xmath1 systematically in a wider range of cuprates that include the multilayer ones as analyzed in pavarini s plot@xcite .",
    "thus the purpose of the present paper is to examine the systematics , where we extend the analysis to bilayer cuprates as well as those single - layer ones that have relatively lower @xmath1 .",
    "this has enabled us to study the correlation between the theoretically estimated @xmath1 and the fermi - surface warping for a much wider class of existing materials ( fig.[fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the systematics have turned out to reproduce the experimental trend in @xmath1 , and we shall unambiguously conclude that the @xmath2 orbital mixture is indeed a key factor that strongly governs the @xmath1 in the cuprates .",
    "let us start with the construction of the two - orbital model .",
    "first - principles electronic structures of the materials are obtained with the vasp package@xcite , where experimentally determined lattice parameters are adopted .",
    "we have used the pbe exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we then employ the @xmath4 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals as projection functions@xcite to model the band structure around the fermi energy .",
    "the main band around the fermi energy contains considerable contributions from the oxygen @xmath5 orbitals , so that they are effectively included in the wannier functions .",
    "similarly , the @xmath10 orbital in the apical oxygens is implicitly included in the @xmath2 wannier orbital .",
    "namely , we consider two kinds of anti - bonding state between the @xmath11 orbitals of copper and @xmath12 orbitals of oxygen in this model . in the bilayer systems ,",
    "the total number of wannier orbitals is four .",
    "let us mention in passing that the present @xmath6 , the level offset between the two wannier orbitals , should not be directly compared to the @xmath11-@xmath11 excitation energy observed experimentally in , e.g. , the rixs experiments@xcite , because , while the present @xmath6 , defined for the wannier orbitals consisting of cu-@xmath13 and o-@xmath5 orbitals , is evaluated within the gga scheme ( with the correlation effects beyond the gga taken into account in the flex procedure ) , rixs experiments measure the energy that includes full electron correlation effects .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] compares the band dispersion of the two - orbital model for eight cuprates@xcite : single - layer ( a ) la@xmath7cuo@xmath8 , ( b ) pb@xmath7sr@xmath7cu@xmath7o@xmath9 , and bilayer ( c ) la@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath9 , ( d ) pb@xmath7sr@xmath7ycu@xmath14o@xmath15 , ( e ) eusr@xmath7nbcu@xmath7o@xmath15 , ( f ) yba@xmath7cu@xmath14o@xmath16(ybco ) , ( g ) hgba@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath9(hbco ) and ( h ) tl@xmath7ba@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath15 . the crystal structures are given in refs .",
    ", respectively .",
    "experimentally , the first five materials are known to have relatively lower @xmath1 ( @xmath17 k ) , while the last three have higher @xmath1 ( @xmath18 k)@xcite . in fig.[fig2 ] , we display the weight of the @xmath2 wannier orbital with the thickness of the lines , which shows that there exist significantly strong @xmath2 mixtures around the flat portions of the bands near the fermi energy in ( a)-(e ) .",
    "by contrast , compounds ( f)-(h ) have the @xmath2 orbital components mostly on the bands well below the fermi energy . in bilayer systems the main band is split into two , where the @xmath2 component , if any , is seen to primarily reside on the upper band .",
    "the band splitting is known to be caused by the interlayer hoppings , which are mediated by orbitals spreading along the @xmath19axis such as the @xmath20 and @xmath2 orbitals@xcite . in fig.[fig2 ] we also display the fermi surfaces at @xmath21 , where we can see that in ( a)-(e ) the ( outer ) fermi surfaces are basically concave against the @xmath22 point ( @xmath23 , while the inner fermi surfaces ( arising from the upper band ) that have larger @xmath2 weights are convex for bilayer systems in ( c)-(e ) .      from the above result",
    ", we can see that the warping of the inner fermi surface decreases as the @xmath2 mixture becomes stronger . in the figure the band filling is fixed at @xmath24 , but we have checked that this tendency persists when the band filling is varied .",
    "although this trend has been noticed in our previous studies@xcite , we can now describe this more systematically and quantitatively for various materials . for this purpose",
    "we have first to quantify the degree of warping of the fermi surface .",
    "this is accomplished by constructing a _ single_-orbital model so that the main bands intersecting the fermi level are reproduced with a single wannier orbital per site .",
    "this wannier orbital mainly consists of the @xmath4 orbital , but also has tails with a @xmath2 orbital character",
    ". we can then define the parameter , @xmath25 in terms of the second ( @xmath26 ) and third ( @xmath27 ) neighbor hoppings of the single - orbital model , which is a direct measure of the fermi surface warping@xcite . for bilayer materials",
    ", @xmath3 can be defined with hoppings within each layer .",
    "bilayers have two sites per unit cell with outer and inner fermi surfaces , so that we can also obtain the respective measures of the warping of the outer and inner fermi surfaces as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the interlayer hopping to the sites vertically above ( or below ) the @xmath30-th neighbor .",
    "we stress that @xmath3 in the single - orbital model includes the effects of both the hoppings within the @xmath4 wannier orbitals and those between the @xmath4 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals in the two - orbital model .    in fig.[fig3](a ) , we plot @xmath3 against @xmath6 for all the bilayer cuprates considered .",
    "the result shows that @xmath3 tends to increase with @xmath6 , which can be understood as follows@xcite . in the two - orbital model that explicitly considers the @xmath2 orbital , the second ( and also the third ) neighbor hopping",
    "takes place via two paths , i.e. , ( i ) directly between @xmath4 wannier orbitals and ( ii ) indirectly via the @xmath2 orbital . as @xmath6 becomes smaller , path ( ii )",
    "becomes more effective . in the single - orbital model ,",
    "the two paths both contribute to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but they have opposite signs , so that @xmath31 and hence @xmath3 are smaller when the contribution from path ( ii ) is larger . to be precise , @xmath32 is larger than @xmath33 despite @xmath34 being smaller than @xmath35 . by analyzing the two - orbital model , we find that the ratio @xmath36 _ within the @xmath4 wannier orbitals",
    "_ , i.e. , path ( i ) ) , which we refer to as @xmath37(ref . ) , is significantly larger in ybco , and we are coming back to this point below .",
    "we now move on to superconductivity . as shown in our previous studies@xcite",
    ", it is imperative to adopt the two - orbital model that explicitly considers the @xmath2 orbital to have a reliable estimate of @xmath1 . in the two - orbital model we consider intra- and inter - orbital electron - electron interactions .",
    "the intra - orbital @xmath38 is considered to be in the range of 7 - 10@xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ev is the nearest - neighbor hopping ) for the cuprates , so we take the intra - orbital @xmath41 ev . the hund s coupling @xmath42 and the pair - hopping @xmath43 are typically @xmath44 , so we take @xmath45 ev . here",
    "we observe the orbital rotational symmetry which gives the inter - orbital @xmath46 ev .",
    "we apply flex@xcite to this multi - orbital hubbard model , and solve the linearized eliashberg equation . in multiorbital",
    "flex , the green s function and spin and charge susceptibilities are given as matrices@xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation @xmath47 increases upon lowering the temperature , and reaches unity at @xmath48 .",
    "therefore @xmath47 at a fixed temperature can be used as a qualitative measure for @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath49ev in the present calculation . the total band filling ( number of electrons /site ) is fixed at @xmath24 , for which the filling of the main band amounts to 0.85 ( 15 % hole doping ) .",
    "we take a @xmath50 @xmath51-point mesh for the three - dimensional lattice with @xmath52 matsubara frequencies .",
    "flex takes account of the self - energy correction self - consistently and amends the overestimated tendency toward magnetism in the random - phase approximation . on the other hand , flex can not reproduce the mott transition that should be present at half - filling nor the @xmath1 suppression in the underdoped regime .",
    "therefore , we stick to the optimal doping regime in the present study .",
    "in fig.[fig3](b ) we plot @xmath47 against @xmath6 calculated for the five bilayer cuprates .",
    "we can see a very well - defined correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath47 . if we combine figs.[fig3](a)(b ) , we can look at the relation between @xmath47 ( obtained for the two - orbital model ) against the measure of the fermi surface warping @xmath3 ( defined in terms of the single - orbital model)@xcite , which is precisely fig.[fig1](a ) . since @xmath47 is a measure of @xmath1",
    ", we can immediately notice that the figure strikingly resembles pavarini s plot@xcite for the experimentally observed @xmath1 against @xmath3 in fig.[fig1](b)@xcite .",
    "this is the key result in the present work .    for comparison ,",
    "we show in the inset of fig.[fig1](a ) the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation within the _ single - orbital _ model , @xmath53 , for the same materials . here",
    "we take the same value of on - site @xmath38 as in the two - orbital model , but raise the temperature to @xmath54 ev , since flex convergence in the single - orbital model is degraded for small @xmath3 at lower temperatures .",
    "the result for @xmath53 exhibits an opposite tendency of decreasing with @xmath3 , which firmly endorses that the @xmath2 orbital mixture is indeed a key factor that determines @xmath1 of the cuprates .    besides the overall trend",
    ", we can also note the following two features .",
    "first , in our @xmath47-@xmath3 plot @xmath47 is larger for bilayer systems than in single - layer ones , which reflects the difference in @xmath6 .",
    "there may be some interlayer many - body interactions ( such as the pair hopping@xcite ) that can further enhance @xmath1 in the bilayer systems , which is not taken into account here .",
    "another point to note is the comparison between ybco and hbco . despite @xmath55 , @xmath47",
    "obtained here is larger for hbco , which agrees with the experimental results for @xmath1 . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath37 is very large for ybco , which is the main reason why the single - orbital @xmath3 is large in this material .",
    "namely , a smaller @xmath47 in ybco is caused by a large @xmath37 rather than by a small @xmath6 , which we have actually checked by varying these quantities in a range covering these materials .",
    "finally , let us pinpoint the origin of the material dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "for this purpose , we now construct a model that explicitly considers all of the cu-@xmath13 and o-@xmath5 orbitals by introducing as many number of wannier orbitals .",
    "namely , the level offset @xmath56 between cu-@xmath4 and cu-@xmath2 and the level offset @xmath57 between in - plane o-@xmath58 and apical - o-@xmath59 , determine the final @xmath6 as shown in our previous study@xcite .",
    "the level offsets , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are defined as the differences in the on - site energies between the atomic - like orbitals . in fig[fig3](c)(d ) , we plot @xmath6 against @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we are now in position to discuss how the two level - offsets are determined by the lattice structure .",
    "the apical oxygen height @xmath62 controls the crystal - field splitting , so that @xmath62 is correlated with @xmath56 ( ref . ) . in the bilayer materials , however , we can see that @xmath56 tends to be larger than in the single - layer ones despite the small @xmath62 .",
    "we can identify this to be coming from the _ pyramidal _ coordination of the oxygen atoms with one apical oxygen per cu in the bilayer cuprates , as opposed to the octahedral coordination with two apical oxygens in single - layer cuprates .",
    "thus the effect of the apical oxygen is more or less halved in the bilayer systems , so that the _ effective _ @xmath62 becomes larger .",
    "this in turn makes @xmath57 play a more important role in the material dependence of @xmath6 and hence @xmath1 .",
    "for example , la@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath9 and ybco have very small values of @xmath62 [ in fig.[fig3](e ) ] , and consequently they have similar values of @xmath56",
    ". however , ybco has a much larger @xmath57 ( smaller absolute value ) , which results in a larger @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath57 playing a more important role than @xmath56 is also seen in terms of the madelung energy difference , @xmath63 , between the apical and in - plane oxygens .",
    "@xmath1 is found to be correlated with @xmath63 rather than the apical oxygen height as in a previous study ( ref . ) , where @xmath63 is in turn correlated with @xmath57@xcite .",
    "one way to control @xmath62 is to apply a hydrostatic pressure to decrease it , but this has small effect on @xmath1 especially for multilayer cuprates because of the reason mentioned above@xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have revealed a systematic correlation between the fermi surface warping and the theoretically evaluated @xmath1 by constructing two- and single - orbital models of various bilayer as well as single - layer cuprates .",
    "a striking agreement of the theoretical result with pavarini s plot for experimental @xmath1 s [ ] unambiguously indicates that the @xmath2 mixture is indeed a key factor that determines @xmath1 in the cuprates .",
    "the level offset @xmath6 between @xmath4 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals mainly depends on two parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , but in multi - layer cuprates the latter plays a more important role than the former , so that the apical oxygen height is less important .",
    "let us recapitulate that the strongly warped fermi surface is not the _ cause _ of the high @xmath1 , but a consequence of the @xmath3-@xmath1 correlation where the @xmath2 orbital mixture ( i.e. , small @xmath6 ) happens to suppress both of the warping ( the single - orbital @xmath3 ) and @xmath1 _ at the same time_. conversely , we can exploit this to note that higher-@xmath1 materials can in principle be conceived if we can realize smaller @xmath3 where @xmath3 is reduced due to smaller @xmath37 ( the hopping ratio within the @xmath4 wannier orbitals ) rather than due to smaller @xmath6 .",
    "the reason why we have an almost universal @xmath3-@xmath1 correlation in actual materials is traced back to @xmath3 that increases with @xmath6 ( fig.[fig3](a ) ) because @xmath37 does not vary widely within the known cuprates . from these observations",
    ", we here propose that _ designing _ materials with small @xmath2 mixture and strongly reduced @xmath37 ( which would give a small @xmath3 ) may lead to higher @xmath1 than the known cuprates , provided other conditions are essentially unchanged@xcite .",
