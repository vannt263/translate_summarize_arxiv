    "high energy - resolution experiments on nuclei excited in the region of giant resonances present a unique way to extract information about the dominant processes of the decay .",
    "this information is imprinted into the fragmentation of giant resonances visible as fine structure in excitation energy spectra .",
    "recent work has established fine structure as a global phenomenon in medium - mass to heavy nuclei for the case of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isgqr ) @xcite .",
    "fine structure has also been demonstrated for a variety of other modes like the spin - isospin flip gamow - teller ( gt ) mode @xcite , the isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr ) @xcite and the magnetic quadrupole resonance @xcite .",
    "a variety of theoretical approaches has been put forward to understand the fine structure including doorway - state analysis @xcite , a local scaling dimension model @xcite , an entropy index method @xcite and wavelet analysis @xcite .",
    "a comparison for representative cases indicates that a wavelet analysis is a particularly promising tool @xcite , since it provides simultaneously a quantitative measure of the fine structure and information on the localization in the excitation energy spectrum .",
    "characteristic scales can be extracted from the power spectra of wavelet transforms , which allow a direct comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "a systematic study of the isgqr @xcite shows that the observed scales in medium - mass to heavy nuclei originate from a collective damping mechanism induced by the coupling of elementary one - particle one - hole ( 1p-1h ) states to low - lying surface vibrations @xcite .",
    "recently , the high energy - resolution measurements of the isgqr have been extended @xcite to the low - mass region @xmath4 .",
    "these experiments were motivated by the question whether collective damping remains the most important decay mechanism in light nuclei or whether other contributions like direct decay or landau damping become more important @xcite .",
    "the present work focuses on the case of @xmath0ca where considerable fragmentation of e2 strength has been observed in electron @xcite , proton @xcite and alpha scattering @xcite studies , albeit measured with varying resolution .",
    "the choice of a doubly magic nucleus allows a comparison to calculations within the framework of rpa and srpa and thus to distinguish between the role of 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations . since in the calculations a modern realistic interaction derived by the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) described in refs .",
    "@xcite has been used , the experimental data serve at the same time as a test bench for ucom .",
    "this interaction is one of a family of realistic interactions and has been used with quite some success in the description of basic nuclear quantities such as masses @xcite and the gross features of giant resonances , in particular the giant dipole and giant quadrupole ones on the srpa level @xcite .",
    "the experiments were carried out with a 200  mev proton beam produced by the separated sector cyclotron ( ssc ) of the ithemba laboratory for accelerator based sciences ( ithemba labs ) , south africa .",
    "the protons scattered inelastically on a @xmath0ca target with an areal density of 3.0 mg/@xmath5 were momentum analyzed with a k600 magnetic spectrometer after scattering .",
    "dispersion matching techniques were used in order to exploit the high energy - resolution capability of the spectrometer .",
    "energy resolutions @xmath6 kev full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) were achieved .",
    "the scattering angles were selected to be below , at and above the maximum of the cross section for @xmath7 transitions into the isgqr .",
    "therefore , measurements were performed at three different scattering angles , @xmath8 , 11@xmath9 and 15@xmath9 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : targetspectra ] , for excitation energies between 6 and 30 mev .",
    "details of the data analysis procedures are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "ca at scattering angles of @xmath10 = 7@xmath11 , 11@xmath11 and 15@xmath11 .",
    "note that the isgqr is most strongly excited at @xmath10 = 11@xmath11 .",
    "the drop of counts in the spectra above 27  mev is due to a gradual loss of angular acceptance towards the end of the spectrometer focal plane.,width=321 ]    the excitation energy spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : targetspectra ] taken at @xmath10 = 11@xmath11 , which corresponds to the maximum cross section for the isgqr , reveals a broad resonance at a mean energy @xmath12 mev with strength distributed between approximately 12 and 22  mev .",
    "intermediate structure is visible through peaks around 12 , 14 , 16 , 17 and 18 mev consistent with previous experimental work @xcite .",
    "pronounced fine structure is observed up to about 20 mev . at the larger scattering angle of @xmath13 , the overall structure",
    "is reduced in size but distinctive features of the fine structure persist . at the smaller scattering angle @xmath10",
    "= 7@xmath11 , the fine structure changes somewhat indicating the presence of other multipoles .",
    "the dominant quadrupole nature of the bump on top of a smooth quasifree background @xcite has been demonstrated by multipole decompositions of angular distributions measured in alpha @xcite and proton @xcite scattering .",
    "properties of the isgqr have also been investigated with electromagnetic probes @xcite and capture experiments @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent in that the energy weighted sum rule for isoscalar e2 strength is almost exhausted in the excitation range of interest .",
    "strong transitions at energies @xmath14  mev consist of a mixture of different multipoles @xcite , while the peaks in the excitation region around 14  mev were shown to have quadrupole character @xcite .    the multipole analysis of proton scattering data in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that for the kinematics of the present experiment at the optimum angle for @xmath15 transfer , contributions from the overlapping isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) and low - energy @xmath16 strength are at the level of a few percent at best .",
    "the ivgdr is strongly populated at forward scattering angles by relativistic coulomb excitation .",
    "however , the angular distribution falls off steeply such that the contribution is already small ( but still sizable ) at @xmath17 and negligible at @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of the spectra along the lines described in ref .",
    "@xcite with the additional constraint of a constant level density independent of the kinematics indicates only limited contributions to the cross sections in the isgqr region from quasifree processes and/or other multipoles .",
    "thus , it seems justifed to assume that the fine structure of the cross sections at @xmath19 arises solely from the isgqr .",
    "another way to verify this conjecture is to use a cross correlation analysis as described e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite . for that purpose ,",
    "any smooth background in the spectra was removed by a discrete wavelet analysis @xcite . in a next step gross structures",
    "were taken out by folding with a gaussian of appropriate width .",
    "the ratio between these two spectra - the so - called stationary spectrum - then contains local fluctuations around the mean only @xcite .",
    "the normalized cross correlation functions @xmath20 between stationary spectra including the @xmath21 angle are quite similar : @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in contrast , a much larger value @xmath24 is found for the @xmath25 angle pair indicating a high degree of correlation , since the value is above an expression derived for the angular cross - correlation function of cross - section fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the fine structure observed in the @xmath18 spectrum is indeed due to the isgqr and contributions from other modes must be small .",
    "wavelet analysis techniques @xcite have been utilized for the extraction of characteristic energy scales from the region of the isgqr excitation @xcite .",
    "continuous wavelet transforms ( cwt ) using both the real and complex morlet mother wavelets have been successfully applied previously @xcite .",
    "application of the cwt to the present data in the energy region of the isgqr is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cawavelet ] . by plotting the real part of the complex coefficients in a two - dimensional distribution of energy scales vs.  excitation energy , the positions of the structures within the original energy spectrum can be identified .",
    "maxima of the wavelet coefficients at certain scale values over the energy region of isgqr ( or parts of it ) indicate characteristic scales .",
    "this is illustrated in the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig : cawavelet ] , where the plotted wavelet energy scale was restricted to 3.0 mev in order to reveal scales related to intermediate structure . the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ fig : cawavelet ] shows the same results but with an expanded wavelet scale to emphasize the presence of characteristic scales in the fine structure as well .    in order to obtain a quantitative measure for the characteristic scales , the absolute values of the complex coefficients",
    "are projected onto the wavelet scale axis .",
    "the resulting power spectrum obtained is shown in r.h.s .",
    "[ fig : catheory](a ) and maxima representing characteristic scales are indicated by arrows .",
    "three peaks at scale values 150 , 240 and 460  kev arising from the fine structure can be identified as well as three scales at 1.05 , 2.0 and 3.9  mev corresponding to intermediate structure .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , all existing rpa calculations of the isgqr in @xmath0ca ( see refs .",

    "[ fig : catheory](b ) on the l.h.s .  are characterized by a dominant peak , which can not yield a scale in the wavelet power spectrum ( cf .",
    "fig .  13 in ref .",
    "we have verified this result using skyrme and gogny interactions .",
    "thus , the experimentally observed fragmentation is usually attributed to mixing of the 1p-1h states with more complex configurations , including collective phonons @xcite .    as such",
    ", here we perform large - scale rpa and srpa calculations with a realistic interaction , @xmath26 .",
    "the main differences of the present to other srpa approaches are : ( i ) the two - body , finite - range interaction is the sole input , describing both the ground state and the residual couplings . in particular , we use @xmath26 , a potential derived from the argonne v18 interaction by renormalizing it within the unitary correlation operator method @xcite .",
    "( ii ) no truncation is imposed on the model space describing the excited states , other than that due to the exhaustion of the single - particle space .",
    "this means that the hartree - fock ( hf ) equations are solved within a selected single - particle space and all 1p-1h and 2p-2h configurations available within that space are taken into account when building the srpa matrix .",
    "the single - particle basis used here consists of harmonic - oscillator wave functions with orbital angular momentum @xmath27 and node quantum number @xmath28 , providing reasonable convergence .",
    "the number of 1p-1h and 2p-2h configurations is about @xmath29 .",
    "further details on the srpa approach can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the isoscalar quadrupole strength distributions and power spectra resulting from both rpa and srpa are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : catheory](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "while the rpa results using @xmath26 sytematically overestimate isgqr energies @xcite , a striking result is that the isgqr strength in @xmath0ca already appears fragmented at the rpa level .",
    "the same interaction produces one dominant isgqr peak for heavier nuclei like @xmath30zr and @xmath31pb @xcite .",
    "we return to this point later . in srpa",
    "the resonance is shifted strongly to lower energies compared to rpa .",
    "indeed , since @xmath26 is a bare interaction with respect to long - range correlations , the srpa is employed not only to supplement rpa with a damping mechanism , but also to effectively dress the 1p-1h configurations , affecting their energy ( for a relevant discussion see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . also observed is that the resonance strength and the profile of the strength distribution are altered , but , as is usually the case with this type of calculation @xcite , not dramatically . the srpa with the present interaction reproduces the global properties of the isgqr well ( the same holds for the ivgdr ) , considering that the input has not been fitted to this end @xcite . in this work",
    "it is used for the first time to analyze the fine structure of the isgqr .",
    "the power spectra analysis reveals that the intermediate and large scales are comparable in rpa and srpa , but in srpa small scales are somewhat more important in the power spectrum .",
    "characteristic scales indicated by arrows in fig .  [ fig : catheory ] show a good correspondence between the theoretical results ( for both rpa and srpa ) and the experimental data except for the smallest scale where the relation to the calculations is unclear , and the largest one , which is suppressed in the calculations .",
    "the question arises as to the origin of the various scales .",
    "the rpa model accounts only for landau damping .",
    "therefore , our rpa results , fig .  [ fig : catheory](b ) , suggest that this mechanism plays an important role in the case of @xmath0ca ( but not in heavier nuclei ) , contrary to predictions using phenomenological effective interactions and density functionals , as already mentioned . regarding the @xmath32 structure of the dominant peaks , we find that the leading components as well as their spacings are quite similar in rpa and srpa .",
    "for example , the two strongest peaks at the higher - energy part of the resonance ( rpa : @xmath33  mev ; srpa : @xmath34  mev ) in both cases contain large @xmath35 components , while the lowest prominent peak ( rpa : 21.59  mev ; srpa : 14.88  mev ) in both cases is rather dominated by @xmath36 configurations .    apparently , landau damping accounts for most of the scales .",
    "this result must be a consequence of the properties of the @xmath26 , which differs in many respects from phenomenological effective interactions .",
    "firstly , it retains all the complexities of the realistic nn interaction and has not been fitted using hf and rpa calculations ( therefore it yields , e.g. , underbound nuclei in hf and too high gqr energies in rpa calculations ) .",
    "we found strong landau fragmentation also with a different renormalized realistic interaction , namely the cd - bonn potential transformed via the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) , suggesting that we are not observing an artifact of the ucom procedure .",
    "semi - realistic effective interactions supplemented with a phenomenological three - body contact term  @xcite , leading to an improved description of nuclear radii  @xcite and of the three major giant resonances on the rpa level  @xcite , still produce considerable fragmentation , by comparison . regarding the tensor terms of @xmath26 which do not affect the hf ground state",
    ", we find only a weak influence on the rpa strength function , although in srpa they account for roughly half of the energy shift of the isgqr between rpa and srpa results .",
    "secondly , the present interaction does not parameterize long - range correlations and corresponds to a very low nucleon effective mass @xmath37 in hf , as is evident from the very broad unperturbed spectra  @xcite .",
    "this alone , however , seems not to be a critical property .",
    "we find , for example , that for traditional skyrme functionals and using continuum rpa , a low @xmath37 value does not lead to fragmentation .",
    "neither does the coupling with the particle continuum produce sufficient spreading ( only up to about 1  mev fwhm ) .",
    "next , we examine the role of 2p-2h configurations in the vicinity of the resonance and of high - lying ones ( the present model space contains 2p-2h configurations with energies up to about 600  mev ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : catheory](d ) and ( e ) , srpa results are shown using only 2p-2h configurations with energies below or above 200  mev , respectively , the latter being roughly the median 2p-2h energy within the present model space .",
    "the configurations in the vicinity of the resonance alone tend to produce spreading , but the corresponding scales are somewhat too large and the energy of the resonance is also too high , as expected @xcite .",
    "subsequent inclusion of the highest states compresses and shifts the spectrum to lower energies .",
    "conversely , high - lying 2p-2h configurations alone tend to produce smaller scales",
    ".    the smallest srpa scale must reflect , to some extent , the structure of the density of states in the vicinity of the resonance and in particular the distribution of 2p-2h configurations acting as doorway states .",
    "therefore , its precise value and prominence could be sensitive to the diagonal approximation ( use of unperturbed 2p-2h configurations ) employed in the present srpa calculation .",
    "that approximation is expected to have no other significant influence on our results though  @xcite .    within the quasiparticle phonon model ( qpm ) and the extended time dependent hartree - fock ( etdhf ) model ,",
    "it has been possible to attribute scales observed in the isgqr to the coupling to low - lying surface vibrations ( collective mechanism ) @xcite . in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , we have attempted to solve the srpa problem while excluding or selecting the strongest matrix elements coupling the 1p-1h and the 2p-2h spaces .",
    "the probability distribution of the matrix elements here is similar to qpm results ( strongly cusp - shaped around zero ) .",
    "no conclusion could be reached as to the effect of the few strongest or the many weak couplings .",
    "small scales were present in all cases .",
    "we note that the present formalism contains only incoherent couplings to the 2p-2h space , although some collective - phonon effects may be present on a tamm - dancoff approximation level , to the extent that the diagonal approximation has been found to be rather good . in any case",
    ", it is not possible to isolate collective effects unambiguously , if at all .",
    "no clear signature is found in the calculatons for the smallest experimental scale .",
    "fine structure in the experimental spectra at these scales is most likely due to overlapping compound nuclear states , i.e.  ericson fluctuations @xcite damped by the experimental resolution @xcite . finally , regarding the largest experimentally extracted scale at about 4  mev",
    ", we can only speculate that it is due to the smooth part of the resonance ( its width ) , not reproduced by the calculations .",
    "the smooth part certainly contains contributions due to a coupling with the particle continuum , broadening all peaks .",
    "escape widths in light nuclei up to @xmath0ca have been shown to be significant @xcite .",
    "also higher - order configurations and correlations may play a role .",
    "we note that in some existing srpa and extended shell - model calculations empirical single - particle states are used , i.e. , the input is already correlated which may be the reason why they appear more efficient in producing more or less a smooth spreading  @xcite .",
    "this discussion , however , is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "fine structure of the isgqr in @xmath0ca has been observed in high energy - resolution proton scattering experiments and analyzed in the framework of a wavelet approach .",
    "comparisons with rpa and srpa calculations using the ucom interaction reveal that the scales characterizing the fine structure are largely present already on the mean - field level .",
    "this finding is in contrast to previous calculations of the isgqr strength distribution in @xmath0ca , which attribute the fragmentation to the coupling of 1p-1h states to low - lying phonons @xcite . at present",
    "we can not exclude that the agreement of scales deduced from rpa and srpa is - at least partly - fortuitous .",
    "however , tests using different interactions indicate that the above result is possibly a consequence of the properties of the renormalized interaction used , which retains all the complexities of the realistic nn interaction as compared to phenomenological mean - field interactions .",
    "the dressing of 1p-1h states in a srpa calculation is necessary to achieve a proper reproduction of the mean isgqr energy and to improve details of the strength distribution .",
    "it seems unlikely that a full treatment of the particle continuum can lead to fragmentation . at the same time",
    ", we can not rule out that coupling to collective phonons additionally plays a role in generating the experimentally observed scales .",
    "the present results underline the relevance of studies of the fine structure of giant resonances as a tool for an improved understanding of collective modes and their decay .",
