    "one of the theories for high-@xmath0 copper - oxide superconductors is the interlayer pair tunneling ( ilpt ) model first proposed by wheatly , hsu and anderson @xcite and later refined by chakravarty , sudb , anderson and strong @xcite .",
    "recently , chakravarty and anderson @xcite gave an indirect justification of this model based on a non - fermi liquid form of the normal state electron propagator .",
    "in the ilpt - model the pairing in the individual copper oxygen layers is enhanced and sustained by the pair tunneling between the layers within the unit cell .",
    "the specific symmetry of the component of the order parameter resulting from in - plane interactions is not an essential feature of the model , although in the original work @xcite it was assumed that this component has s - wave symmetry . in this paper",
    "we generalize the bcs - like form of the ilpt - model given by chakravarty _",
    "et al_.  to include the retardation ( i.  e.  the strong coupling ) effects resulting from in - plane interactions .",
    "this generalization is necessary in order to obtain a more realistic dependence of @xmath0 and other quantities characterizing the superconducting state on the interaction parameters @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strong coupling form of the interlayer pair tunneling model is suitable for including the effect of in - plane nonmagnetic impurity scattering .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on impurity concentration @xcite is considered to be an important indicator of the symmetry of the order parameter in oxide superconductors and of the underlying pairing mechanism @xcite .",
    "the self - energy equations derived in this paper are valid for any kind of in - plane pairing interaction within the one - boson exchange approximation . in our numerical work , however , we consider only the case when the in - plane pairing arises from electron coupling to optical phonons .",
    "this was motivated by the fact that the ilpt - mechanism is novel enough that its consequences should be examined first when the in - plane pairing is caused by the conventional electron - phonon interaction before more exotic in - plane interaction models are considered . also , song and annett @xcite recently derived an effective single - band hubbard - type hamiltonian for cuo@xmath2 planes which includes the electron - phonon coupling to oxygen breathing modes .",
    "the electron - phonon matrix element squared is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron momenta . with this form of coupling song and annett initially predicted that the order parameter with d@xmath1-wave symmetry would lead to a higher transition temperature than the order parameter with s - wave symmetry , because in the former case the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 becomes ineffective .",
    "subsequently , they found this prediction to be erroneous , which we independently confirmed during the course of this study .",
    "we found , however , that the d@xmath1-wave state could be stabilized by the interlayer tunneling .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give in some detail the derivation of the interlayer tunneling contribution to the electron self - energy in the superconducting state and list the well known results for the self - energy parts arising from in - plane interactions .",
    "in addition , we summarize the @xmath0-equations for the case of pairing induced by electron - optic phonon coupling .",
    "section iii contains our numerical results for the transition temperature as a function of increasing disorder and the oxygen isotope exponent , and finally in section iv we give conclusions .",
    "in the ilpt - model it is assumed that in the superconducting state the quasiparticle picture is approximately valid for motion within a layer , while the coherent motion of quasiparticles from layer to layer within the unit cell is blocked @xcite . the part of the hamiltonian which describes the interlayer pair tunneling for two layers per unit cell @xcite is @xmath7\\>,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is an electron creation operator for the state of two - dimensional momentum @xmath4 and spin @xmath9 in the layer @xmath10 , and @xmath11^{2}\\>,\\ ] ] as suggested by band structure calculations @xcite . here",

    "moreover , in the weak coupling approximation for in - plane interactions @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 do not depend on matsubara frequency , and the sum in ( 7 ) could be easily performed using contour integration @xcite .",

    "the precise form of the self - energy due to in - plane interactions depends on the model used and we will restrict ourselves to the case where the pairing interaction is due to one - boson ( e.  g.  phonon or spin - fluctuation ) exchange .",
    "the electron - phonon contribution to the self - energy is @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath47 is the electron - phonon matrix element for the momentum transfer @xmath48 and the phonon polarization @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the corresponding phonon propagator at the boson matsubara frequency @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the electron propagator for the layer @xmath31 .",
    "an analogous expression is obtained for the self - energy due to the exchange of antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations , except that @xmath53 is replaced by the spin - fluctuation propagator and the pauli matrix @xmath54 by the unit @xmath55 matrix @xcite .    in the case of phonon - mediated superconductivity",
    "one can include the effect of short - range coulomb repulsion within an effective single band hubbard model for copper - oxygen planes @xcite .",
    "the resulting contribution to the electron self - energy is @xmath56 where @xmath6 is the on - site coulomb repulsion and @xmath57 is the off - diagonal part of the electron nambu green s function @xcite .",
    "finally we consider the effect of in - plane electron - impurity scattering .",
    "we will not consider all the possible effects of electron - impurity scattering in two - dimensional superconductors ( e.  g.   the enhancement of the coulomb repulsion @xcite ) , but will confine ourselves to the simplest treatment using either the second born approximation or the t - matrix approximation . in the second born approximation and assuming a constant electron - impurity matrix element @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the change in the crystal potential due to nonmagnetic impurity , the electron self - energy resulting from scattering off impurities is @xmath60 while in the t - matrix approximation the self - energy is given by @xmath61^{-1}\\>.\\ ] ]      we consider the case where the in - plane pairing is mediated by an optic phonon of energy @xmath62 .",

    "the results for @xmath103 and isotropic in - plane interaction served as a check of the accuracy of the results obtained from the calculations in @xmath4-space . due to memory size restrictions on the computers that were available to us ( 4 processor sgi r4400 and fujitsu vpx240/10 ) the largest lattice size that we could consider was @xmath104 .",

    "otherwise , the truncation of the sum over the matsubara frequencies in ( 25 ) and the finite lattice size could lead to an error in @xmath0 as great as @xmath106 in the case of isotropic in - plane interaction with @xmath103 .",
    "this error in @xmath0 is largely due to error in the chemical potential @xmath15 which leads to an incorrect value for the density of states near @xmath15 .",
    "we found that this trick of adding and subtracting leads to values of @xmath0 that are accurate to better than @xmath107 for the largest lattice size that we could consider .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath66 in ( 14 ) was obtained using the power method @xcite and due to the simple structure of the sums over the matsubara frequencies in ( 25 - 31 ) there was no need to use the fast fourier transform technique of serene and hess @xcite .",
    "the resulting code vectorized @xmath108-@xmath109 on fujitsu vpx240/10 .",
    "we first consider the isotropic model of electron - phonon interaction and , naturally , assume the s - wave symmetry of the pairing self - energy .",
    "3 illustrates the suppression of @xmath0 by in - plane impurity scattering obtained within the born approximation for four different values of the interlayer pair tunneling parameter @xmath110 ( eq .  ( 2 ) ) , and with the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath111 .",
    "it should be stated from the outset that with the strong coupling effects ( i.  e.  renormalization ) one needs a larger value of @xmath112 to achieve a transition temperature of about 100@xmath66 with no disorder than in the bcs - like treatment @xcite ( here the electron phonon mass renormalization parameter is @xmath113 as deduced from the value of z at the first matsubara frequency and @xmath96 ) . in the born approximation",
    "the impurity scattering is parametrized by @xmath114 , and we plot @xmath0 as a function of this quantity . if we take @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the band electronic density of states at the fermi level , as the measure of the elastic scattering rate , the range shown in fig .",
    "3 corresponds to about @xmath117 ; with @xmath118 the maximum value of @xmath114 in fig .  3 is obtained for the in - plane impurity concentration @xmath119 per cell .",
    "the overall shapes of the curves in fig .",
    "3 are similar to the results obtained by bang @xcite in the bcs - type of treatment using the circular fermi surface and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 gives the position of @xmath122 on the fermi surface .",
    "however , we find that @xmath0 is suppressed at a much slower rate than what was obtained by bang in the born limit @xcite . at first , it is surprising that we get a drop in @xmath0 with increasing @xmath114 for @xmath103 . in this case",
    "there is no gap anisotropy which could be washed out by the impurity scattering leading to the suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "also , the structure in @xmath94 within a range @xmath123 around the fermi level does not seem to be significant enough ( see the inset in fig .",
    "2 ) for the smearing caused by the elastic scattering rate @xmath124 to have any significant effect on @xmath0 .",
    "we checked the result for @xmath103 by converting the @xmath4-sums into integrals over electronic energies , as discussed at the beginning of this section , and found the same result .",
    "upon inspection we found that with increasing @xmath114 there is a slight shift in the chemical potential to the region of lower density of states .",
    "although the reduction of the density of states at the chemical potential is small , the exponential dependence of @xmath0 on the interaction parameters presumably leads to the observed decrease in @xmath0 for @xmath103 . note that the rate of suppression is greater for increased @xmath112",
    "the reason for this trend has been discussed by bang @xcite .",
    "next we consider the effect of in - plane disorder in the t - matrix approximation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  4 for @xmath125 .",
    "we plot @xmath0 as a function of the in - plane impurity concentration @xmath126 for several values of the impurity scattering potential parameter @xmath127 . note that for @xmath128 the t - matrix approximation ( solid line ) and the born approximation ( dots ) give very similar results as one would expect in the limit of small @xmath127 ( see eqs .",
    "( 11 - 12 ) ) .",
    "increasing @xmath127 leads to a more rapid suppression of @xmath0 with increasing impurity concentration , and the unitary limit is reached by @xmath129@xmath130 with @xmath111 .",
    "note , however , the change in curvature of @xmath0 versus @xmath126 as @xmath127 is increased .",
    "this trend was not found in the weak coupling calculation of bang @xcite in crossover from the born limit to the unitary limit .",
    "however , the overall rate of suppression of the transition temperature with increasing disorder that we find in the unitary limit is comparable to the rate found by bang @xcite for @xmath131 ( with our @xmath132 states / cell / mev / spin the impurity concentration @xmath133 cell@xmath134 corresponds to the impurity scattering rate in the unitary limit @xmath135 mev ) .",
    "we also obtained step - like features in the @xmath0-curves in the unitary limit which we are not able to associate with any particular feature of the model and/or the numerical procedure used .",
    "the experiments @xcite in general do not report the data on the very fine scale over which we observe the steps , and only in @xcite was there an attempt to interpret fine features of the observed dependence of @xmath0 in y@xmath136pr@xmath137ba@xmath2cu@xmath138o@xmath139 on pr concentration .",
    "it should be kept in mind that only the experiment of tolpygo _",
    "et al_.   @xcite addresses specifically the in - plane defects in yba@xmath2cu@xmath140o@xmath141 at the fixed carrier concentration to which our model calculations apply . the most important aspect of fig .",
    "4 is that it illustrates the profound effect of the coulomb interaction on the dependence of @xmath0 on the concentration of in - plane impurities . for @xmath142 ( the bandwidth )",
    "the solid curve in fig .  4 obtained for @xmath143 in the t - matrix approximation is pushed down to the line given by squares .",
    "the decrease in @xmath0 for @xmath142 is about 5k per 1% of in - plane defects , similar to the value found by monthoux and pines @xcite for @xmath143 in the model of spin - fluctuation - induced superconductivity and d - wave paring , and to the value measured by tolpygo _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found that for this choice of parameters ( @xmath113 , @xmath144ev ) switching off the interlayer pair tunneling reduces the transition temperature from 84.5k ( for @xmath145mev ) to 1.6k for @xmath146 .",
    "this illustrates the remarkable effect of the interlayer pair tunneling mechanism on the enhancement of @xmath0 .",
    "next , we turn to the anisotropic model of the electron - phonon coupling function , eq .  ( 33 ) . the results for @xmath145mev using the t - matrix approximation are shown in fig .  5 .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction we were not able to obtain a finite transition temperature assuming d@xmath1-symmetry of the pairing self - energy for @xmath103 down to the lowest temperature that we could consider using the @xmath4-space method ( about 20k ) .",
    "however , with @xmath145mev we obtained a transition temperature of 114k assuming d@xmath1-symmetry of the gap for @xmath146 .",
    "it is interesting that the s - wave case with @xmath147 and the d@xmath1-wave case ( the on - site coulomb repulsion drops out , eq .",
    "( 10 ) ) give quite a similar dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath126 for both @xmath143 and @xmath148 .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath143 are similar to the experimental results on yba@xmath2cu@xmath140o@xmath141 with in - plane oxygen defects @xcite , although we find that the squares in fig .",
    "4 more closely resemble the experimental data at the highest values of @xmath126 where the data seem to fall on a curve that becomes less steep as @xmath126 is increased . in the unitary limit",
    "@xmath148 the @xmath0-curves initially rise with increasing @xmath126 and then precipitously drop .",
    "there seems to be a common threshold @xmath126 beyond which superconductivity disappears for both the s - wave pairing with either @xmath147 or @xmath142 and for d@xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "we have found a similar behavior for s - wave pairing with @xmath142 , @xmath145mev and @xmath143 ( not shown here ) , except that the initial rise in @xmath0 is much less pronounced and the threshold occurs at a higher value of @xmath126 .",
    "we would like to point out that with the electron - phonon coupling function given by eq .",
    "( 33 ) it is possible to have an impurity induced crossover from the d@xmath1-wave state in a very pure system to the s - wave state at a higher impurity concentration , fig .",
    "all of the interaction parameters for the two curves in fig .",
    "6 are the same .",
    "the only difference is that for the solid curve the d@xmath1-symmetry of the pairing self - energy is assumed ( in this case the on - site coulomb interaction drops out , eq .",
    "( 10 ) ) , while for the triangles the s - wave symmetry is assumed . at a given impurity concentration",
    "the system will go into a state with a higher @xmath0 in order to lower its free - energy .",
    "we have examined the isotope effect associated with the optic phonon which mediates the in - plane interaction . in the original work of chakravarty _",
    "et al_.  it was suggested that the interlayer pair tunneling mechanism could explain a small isotope effect in high-@xmath0 copper oxide superconductors simply because in the interlayer tunneling model the most important pairing process is associated with the pair tunneling .",
    "our results for the isotope exponent @xmath149 associated with the optic mode at @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "7 . in the same figure",
    "we give the corresponding transition temperatures .",
    "the impurity scattering was set equal to zero and the results for s - wave symmetry were obtained for the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 equal to zero .",

    "7)a value approximately equal to what is found for the oxygen isotope effect in high-@xmath0 y - ba - cu - o systems @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that in the site selective oxygen isotope experiments of nickel _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , where only the oxygen in copper - oxygen planes is replaced by heavier isotope , a small negative isotope effect is observed with the partial isotope exponent @xmath155close to the resolution limit @xcite . for anisotropic electron - phonon interaction , eq .",

    "turning on @xmath142 reduces the @xmath0 to 78k and increases the isotope exponent to @xmath158 . for d@xmath1-symmetry of the gap we obtain very small positive values of @xmath156likely smaller than the experimental resolution @xcite",
    "we have generalized the interlayer pair tunneling model of anderson and coworkers to include the retardation effects associated with in - plane interactions . through numerical solutions of the @xmath0-equations for a model",
    "in which electrons couple to an optic phonon at 500 cm@xmath134 ( i.  e.   62 mev ) we found , without trying to fit the experiments , that a reasonable choice for the band parameters ( @xmath160mev , @xmath91 ) , band filling factor ( 0.75 electrons per cell ) , electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath113 ) , on - site coulomb repulsion ( @xmath161 the bandwidth ) , and the interlayer pair tunneling strength ( @xmath162ev ) yields results in surprisingly good agreement with the experiments on both a @xmath0 suppression by in - plane oxygen defects @xcite and the oxygen isotope effect @xcite in yba@xmath2cu@xmath140o@xmath141 . the best agreement is found for the isotropic model of the electron - phonon coupling function with @xmath142 which leads to a @xmath0 suppression rate of about 5k per 1% of the in - plane defects ( with the impurity matrix element @xmath143 ) and to the oxygen isotope exponent @xmath154 .",
