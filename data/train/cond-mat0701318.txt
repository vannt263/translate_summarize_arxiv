    "these issues are investigated in the present paper .",
    "before we give a summary of the main points of the present paper let us give a brief introduction of the basic ideas behind matrix berry phases .",
    "consider a degenerate pair of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which may be _ single particle or many body states_. if the system is in a superposition state @xmath2 at time t=0 an adiabatic evolution of the parameters @xmath3 can transform this state into another state @xmath4 after some time @xmath5 . here",
    "the orthonormal basis states @xmath6 are the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian . for a cyclic change with the period @xmath7 , represented by a closed contour @xmath8 in the parameter space , the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 return to the initial states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 may not return the initial values . in such a case a @xmath15 matrix berry phase (",
    "non - abelian berry phase ) @xmath16 is generated @xmath17 the expansion coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfy the time - dependent schr@xmath20dinger equation @xmath21 the matrix elements @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 , where the sum over @xmath24 in @xmath22 is meant to be the sum over @xmath3 .",
    "the non - abelian vector potentials @xmath25 are @xmath15 matrices @xmath26 note that the wavefunctions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are _ degenerate_. the role of the non - abelian vector potentials is to keep the energy degeneracy intact while the system parameters change .",
    "our investigation shows that when even number of electrons are present the many body groundstate may not be doubly degenerate .",
    "however , when odd number of electrons are present the groundstate may be doubly degenerate . in the simplest possible approximation the antisymmetry of many body wavefunctions can be ignored .",
    "then the degenerate groundstates for three electrons are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are single electron wavefunctions , see fig.[fig : single ] . in this case",
    "one can show that the solutions of the time dependent schroedinger equation , eq.([eq : time_schrod ] ) , have the form @xmath32 the function @xmath33 depends on the single electron non - abelian vector potentials of the _ first _ shell , and the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on the single electron non - abelian vector potentials of the _ second _ shell , see fig.[fig : single ] ( the function @xmath33 is periodic with the period @xmath7 ) . the probability to find an electron in the state @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "so these probabilities are _ independent _ of the phase factor @xmath38 , i.e. , of the non - abelian vector potentials of the first shell .    in the next simplest possible approximation",
    "the antisymmetry of many body wavefunctions can be included . in this case",
    "the doubly degenerate many body groundstates may be taken to be two slater determinant wavefunctions , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , that are time reversed states of each other , see fig.[fig : many ] .",
    "it will be shown below that the antisymmetry of these slater determinant wavefunctions does _ not _ change the results obtained above for the matrix berry phase .",
    "in addition to the antisymmetry one can include correlation effects .",
    "this can be done by including four basis vectors @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , see fig.[fig : many ] . in this case",
    "the groundstates are given by linear combinations of these four states and are thus correlated .",
    "it can be shown that the non - abelian gauge potentials for a correlated electron system are related to non - abelian gauge potentials for single electrons , provided that the definition of single electron non - abelian gauge potentials is extended to @xmath43 when @xmath44 and @xmath45 belong to _ different _ single electron energy shells .",

    "this can be done by following the steps given in sec.iii .",
    "the number of single electron basis states @xmath119 can be truncated to a reasonable number by comparing the relative magnitude of the single particle energy spacing and the strength of the coulomb interaction .    using _ these _ single electron eigenstates slater determinant states @xmath27 and their time reserved states",

    "the matrix berry phase is thus absent . in the simplest possible approximation",
    "the groundstate @xmath144 of two electron system is given by the single slater determinant made of the single particles states @xmath145 .",
    "in this case the initial state should return to itself after the adiabatic cycle .",
    "it is instructive to verify this explicitly by transforming each single particles states .",
    "the initial state is @xmath146 the transformed two electron slater determinant is @xmath147 , which is @xmath148 . since the transformed single electron states are time reversed states of each other @xmath149 .",

    "@xmath178 this is precisely the non abelian vector potentials for the _ second _ energy shell . the probability to find an electron in the state @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "so these probabilities are _ independent _ of the non - abelian vector potentials of the first energy shell .",
    "in addition it should be noted that the antisymmetry of the many electron wavefunction does _ not _ change the value of the matrix berry phase obtained from the wavefunctions without the antisymmetry , see eq.([eq : berry ] ) .",

    "usually the non abelian vector potentials are defined between two degenerate states , see eq.([eq : vector_pot ] ) .",
    "when electron correlations are important the matrix elements between two single electron states belonging to _ different _ energy shells are relevant ( see the last four equations in eq.([eq : result ] ) ) . we will call these inter shell non - abelian vector potentials .",

    "it would be interesting to investigate the role of these inter shell non - abelian vector potentials in parabolic dots .",
    "optical dipole transitions@xcite can be used to detect matrix berry phases even when several electrons interact strongly with each other .",
    "this is because the dipole oscillator strength will depend on the matrix berry phase@xcite .",
    "however , our results in sec .",
    "v indicate the matrix berry phases will be independent of many body physics when the energy level spacing between the shells is larger than the characteristic coulomb energy . in self",

    "is expected to be larger than the the dresselhaus coupling and in iii - v semiconductors the opposite is true@xcite .",
    "the typical value of the energy scale associated with the rashba constant depends on the electric field applied along the z - axis and the semiconductor material : it is of order @xmath202 , where the length scale @xmath203 is the lateral dimension of the quantum dot .",
    "the second adiabatic parameter @xmath204 represents the strength of the distortion potential @xmath205 : the expectation value of the distortion potential is @xmath206 .",
    "its magnitude is of order @xmath207 , depending on the electric field applied along the y - axis .    in self - assembled inas quantum dots@xcite",
    "the level spacing can be larger than the characteristic coulomb energy , and our investigation shows that in such a case the many problem essentially reduces to a single particle problem ( the energy @xmath208 associated with the length scale @xmath209 is typically of order 20 - 40mev in self - assembled quantum dots ) . in this regime , as we explained above , the exchange effect disappears in matrix berry phases and it is only the last singly occupied electron that matters .",
    "the presence of the other electrons in the inert filled shells will just modify the confinement potential .",
    "thus the matrix berry phase can be calculated following the method outlined in ref[11 ] , and below we give some typical values of the matrix berry phases .",

    "we have verified that two different values of the frequency @xmath220 give the same values of @xmath221 as long as the other parameters are unchanged , confirming that the matrix berry phase is a geometric phase@xcite .",
    "this should be tested in any experimental investigation of matrix berry phases .",

    "<S> adiabatic time evolution of degenerate eigenstates of a quantum system provides a means for controlling electronic states since mixing between degenerate levels generates a matrix berry phase . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling in n - type semiconductor quantum dots </S>",
    "<S> the electron hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal operation and the many body groundstate may be doubly degenerate . this double degeneracy can generate non - abelian vector potentials when odd number of electrons are present . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the antisymmetry of many electron wavefunction has no effect on the matrix berry phase . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived equations that allow one to investigate the effect of electron correlations by expressing the non - abelian vector potentials for many electron system in terms of single electron non - abelian vector potentials . </S>"
