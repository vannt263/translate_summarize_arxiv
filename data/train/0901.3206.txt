    "discrimination of quantum states is a challenging task which dramatically differs from discrimination of states of a classical system .",
    "the main difference between quantum and classical discriminating problems is that single copies of _ nonorthogonal _ quantum states can not be distinguished perfectly .",
    "there exist several strategies how to approach the problem of quantum - state discrimination which are related to different choices of a figure of merit that defines what is considered to be the best measurement .",
    "in particular , the strategy that minimizes a mean probability of error is called the _ min - error _ approach @xcite .",
    "another equally well motivated strategy is the so - called unambiguous discrimination @xcite . in this strategy errors in conclusions",
    "are not permitted , which implies that also inconclusive results are acceptable . nevertheless , whenever we obtain a conclusive result we know for sure that it is correct .",
    "various discrimination tasks may differ by _ a prior _ information about the quantum system we are measuring .",
    "the discrimination among two known pure states represents a situation , where we have the maximum knowledge about the possible preparations of the system . on the other hand one can consider a situation when we have no classical information available about the preparation",
    "specifically , instead of being given only one unknown quantum system , we are given additional quantum systems , denoted as reference states , that represent possible preparations .",
    "our task is to determine unambiguously with which reference states the unknown quantum system match .",
    "this problem is coined as the unambiguous identification ( ui ) and can be used , for example , in a communication of parties that do not share common reference frame . in such case",
    "reference states can be seen as an `` alphabet '' that is always send along with the classical information carried by the unknown state .",
    "if parties are communicating over medium unstable in time ( e.g. optical fiber , air,@xmath0 ) then the ui overcomes a standard need for a re - calibration of communication channel induced by the changes in the medium .    in our previous paper @xcite ( to which we will refer as to paper i )",
    "we showed that the ui for modes of an electromagnetic field can be efficiently performed if we known that states to be discriminated are coherent states with unknown amplitudes .",
    "we shown that this prior knowledge ( or , a reduction of a set of considered states of an electromagnetic mode ) significantly improves the success of a discrimination process .",
    "furthermore , we proposed a simple optical setup consisting of a set of beam splitters and photodetectors for implementation of optimal ui measurement .",
    "this setup was also recently experimentally realized by l. bartukov _",
    "_ @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study possible generalizations of an optical setup proposed in paper i and we investigate modifications and generalizations of the unambiguous identification of coherent states .",
    "more specifically , in sec .",
    "[ genstrat1 ] we show how the ui of coherent states can be performed in a general case when multiple copies of unknown and reference states are available .",
    "this investigation is motivated by the observation that with the increase of the number of identically prepared particles we can better identify the preparator , so we are `` closer '' to a classical domain . in sec .",
    "[ recov1 ] we investigate the possibilities for a recovery of reference states after the measurement is performed .",
    "this recovery process might seem to be prohibited by the rules of quantum mechanics ( due to irreversible disturbance of a quantum state by a measurement ) .",
    "nevertheless , we show that in spite of the fact that the recovered reference states are `` degraded '' ( disturbed ) , nevertheless they can be used in the next round of ui - this is true under the condition that an undisturbed ( new ) copy of an unknown state is provided . such a scenario can be seen as a repeated search in a quantum database , where the data , i.e. the reference states , degrade with their repeated use . in sec",
    "iv we investigate the influence of various imperfections and a noise on the performance of our ui setups .",
    "our findings are summarized in sec .",
    "v while the appendix contains some technical details of our calculations and proofs .",
    "we start our investigation of unambiguous identification tasks with posing the problem within a sufficiently wide framework .",
    "specifically , we shall consider a set of modes of quantum electromagnetic field ( linear harmonic oscillators ) each of which with a semi - infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we shall consider that each of the mode is prepared in a coherent state of a specific amplitude .",
    "all together we will consider a set of @xmath2 groups of electromagnetic modes .",
    "the group @xmath3 of @xmath4 modes @xmath5 carries @xmath4 copies of an unknown coherent state @xmath6 .",
    "each of the remaining @xmath7 groups @xmath8 contains @xmath9 copies of the reference states @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we are guaranteed that the unknown state @xmath6 is the same as one of the reference states @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "our task is to find out unambiguously with which reference state the unknown state matches .",
    "thus , in general , the discrimination problem corresponds to a selection among one of @xmath7 possible types of states : @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the most general measurement strategy unambiguously discriminating among these @xmath7 possibilities can be described by a positive operator value measure ( povm ) consisting of @xmath2 elements @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the element @xmath17 corresponds to a correct identification of @xmath18 while @xmath19 corresponds to an inconclusive result , i.e. the failure of the measurement .",
    "these elements must obey `` no - error '' conditions [ eq .",
    "( [ stavy2 ] ) ] and they have to constitute a proper povm [ eq .",

    "the optimality of a ui measurement is defined with respect to the average performance @xmath25 .",
    "however , we will see that in most of the optical setups we propose it suffices to optimize @xmath26 , because the optimal value of the transmittivities in the setup does not depend on specific reference states . in eq .",
    "( [ meanpi ] ) we integrate over multiple infinite ( complex ) planes of complex amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately , a uniform distribution on an infinite plane can not be properly defined .",
    "thus , @xmath24 can not be uniform , but instead should be `` regularized '' , i.e. it should satisfy some reasonable physical requirements .",
    "for example , the probability of having reference states with very big amplitudes , i.e. of very high energy , should be vanishing . in the present paper",
    "we will calculate @xmath26 , because most of the features that the averaged probability @xmath25 will have are already apparent in @xmath26 .    in paper",
    "i we focused our attention mainly on the ui problem with a single copy of an unknown state and a single copy of each of two reference states ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) .",
    "we proposed a simple efficient ui measurement utilizing three beam splitters and two photodetectors .",
    "the whole setup is supposed to operate as follows : the unknown state @xmath6 is split by the first @xmath29 beam splitter . as a result",
    "we obtain two equally `` diluted '' copies of the unknown state of a coherent state of a single mode is distributed into two modes each in a coherent state with the amplitude @xmath30 . due to the unitarity of the process no information was lost . ] described by a vector @xmath31",
    ". each of these `` copies '' @xmath32 is , together with one of the reference states , fed into the second ( respectively the third ) unbalanced beam splitter .",
    "the second ( respectively the third ) beam splitter performs the comparison of the diluted unknown state @xmath32 with the first ( respectively the second ) reference state .",
    "detection of photons at the output modes of these quantum - state comparison measurement setups @xcite unambiguously indicates that @xmath6 differs from @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "this enables us to conclude that @xmath35 or @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we show in appendix [ app1 ] , that this measurement is optimal if we restrict ourselves to discrimination of coherent states with the use of linear optical elements , number resolving photodetectors .",
    "naturally , coherent states encode complex numbers . from this point of view the state @xmath32 carries formally the whole information about the complex amplitude .",
    "this is due to the fact that we know the factor @xmath37 by which @xmath38 is rescaled .",
    "if the complex amplitude @xmath38 is encoded in the state @xmath39 then for @xmath40 we will speak about a `` diluted '' unknown state while the case @xmath41 will be referred to as a `` concentrated '' unknown state @xmath6 .",
    "these terms come from the fact that the `` diluted '' state can be obtained by mixing a coherent state and a vacuum at an input of a beam splitter . as a result of the beam splitter transformation two modes at the output of the beam splitter are in the diluted states . on the contrary",
    ", the `` concentrated '' state can be prepared by launching two copies of the same coherent state into the beam splitter . as a result",
    "we obtain one of the output modes in the `` concentrated '' state while the second mode in the vacuum state . using a sequence of beamsplitters and corresponding resources one",
    "can prepare ",
    "diluted or `` concentrated '' states with arbitrary value of the scaling factor @xmath42 .",
    "copies of a coherent state @xmath43 we obtain at the output of a sequence of @xmath44 beamspitters one mode in the coherent state @xmath45 and @xmath44 modes in a vacuum state @xmath46 .",
    ", width=264 ]    actually , preparation of `` concentrated '' states is the main idea we will employ in our investigation of the ui measurement with multiple copies of unknown and reference states . at the beginning of the ui measurement we will , for each kind of a state , concentrate the information encoded in its @xmath47 copies into a single quantum system .",
    "this can be done by a sequence of @xmath44 beam splitters ( see fig .  [ collector ] ) with transmitivities chosen so that the input state @xmath48 constructively interferes to produce the state @xmath49 .",
    "more details about this transformation can be found in sec .",
    "iii.a of @xcite .",
    "the result of these preliminary transformations is a mapping of possible types of states @xmath18 into states @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . as a next step",
    "we will use the setup proposed in sec .",
    "iii of paper i for a single copy of the unknown state and single copies of @xmath7 reference states .",
    "of course , as we will see below the transmitivities of all beam splitters in the setup must be modified according to the number of copies of the unknown and the reference states we are given .",
    "the unambiguous identification of two types of coherent reference states is the first natural step in generalizing the scenario with single copies of unknown and reference states investigated in paper i. in this section we consider @xmath27 and @xmath52 are arbitrary .",
    "the above mentioned idea of `` concentration '' of quantum information implies that we first feed all provided copies of the unknown state into @xmath53 beam splitters to obtain the first state @xmath54 in the mode @xmath55 ( for brevity later called only @xmath3 ) .",
    "the other modes @xmath56 end up in a vacuum state , therefore we will not consider them further .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 ( respectively , @xmath58 ) beam splitters are used to prepare the state @xmath59 ( respectively , @xmath60 ) in the modes @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "next , we feed these concentrated states into essentially the same scheme as in paper i ( see fig .",
    "[ multi1 ] ) .",
    "thus , altogether we are going to use @xmath63 beam - splitters .",
    "the analysis of the setup presented in fig .",
    "[ multi1 ] is analogous to paper i , therefore we comment on it only briefly .",
    "a beamsplitter transforms two input modes prepared in coherent states @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , as @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for a reflectivity and a transmittivity coefficients of the beamsplitter . the setup in fig .",
    "[ multi1 ] employs one additional input mode @xmath68 initially prepared in a vacuum state , i.e. the state vector describing four input modes reads @xmath69 where @xmath38 is guaranteed to be either @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "the action of the three beamsplitters in the setup is described by a unitary transformation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is associated with the @xmath74-th beamsplitter @xmath75 acting on the modes @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "since beamsplitters do not entangle coherent states it follows that the output state @xmath78 remains factorized . in the first step the beamsplitter @xmath61 with transmittivity @xmath79 prepares two `` diluted '' copies of the state @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath80 in the second step the beamsplitters @xmath81 perform the transformation such that the output state reads @xmath82 with @xmath83",
    "a crucial observation is that the parameters @xmath84 can be adjusted so that either the mode @xmath3 , or the mode @xmath85 , ends up in a vacuum state providing that @xmath86 , or @xmath87 , respectively . in particular , setting the transmittivities to @xmath88 we find @xmath89    finally , we perform photodetection in output the modes @xmath3 and @xmath85 by photodetectors @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively . by detecting a photon in one of the two modes we can unambiguously identify the unknown state . in particular , for these two modes we have @xmath92 we note that due to the fact that at least one of the modes is in a vacuum state both detectors can not `` click '' ( detect the photons ) at the same time .",
    "therefore , in each single run of the experiment only three situations can happen : none of the detectors click , only the detector @xmath91 clicks , only the detector @xmath90 clicks.if only the detector @xmath91 clicks that following eqs .",
    "( [ identifstavy ] ) we unambiguously conclude that @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , if only the detector @xmath90 clicks we unambiguously conclude that @xmath94 .",
    "if none of the detectors click we can not determine which mode was not in the vacuum state and therefore this situation represents an inconclusive result .",
    "if @xmath93 , then the probability of a correct identification is given as the probability of detecting at least one photon in the mode @xmath85 @xmath95 analogously , in the case @xmath94 the probability of a correct identification reads @xmath96 thus the total probability of the identification of reference states @xmath33 and @xmath34 is equal to @xmath97    next we will optimize the performance of the setup by choosing an appropriate value of transmittivity @xmath79 .",
    "the definition of the uniform distribution on the set of coherent states is problematic , therefore we first focus our attention on the probability of identification for a particular choice of reference states @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , expressed by eq .",
    "( [ pibsstavy ] ) .",
    "the investigation of the first derivative @xmath98 reveals that the optimal choice of @xmath79 does not depend on the reference states @xmath33 , @xmath34 only if @xmath99 .",
    "as one expects , because of symmetry arguments , @xmath79 is optimally set to @xmath100 if @xmath99 . in such a case",
    ", @xmath101 can be simplified to take the following form : @xmath102 let us note that if @xmath103 then there exists a prior probability @xmath104 for which the optimal choice of @xmath79 does not depend on the reference states . however , as already mentioned , we focus on the @xmath21 case and we will assume that we are given the same number of copies of each reference state .",
    "the number of copies of an unknown state or of a reference state we have can be seen as a measure of some resource . from this point of view",
    "an interesting question immediately arises . which type of resource is more useful for an unambiguous identification of coherent states ? are unknown states more useful than reference states or vice versa ? to answer these questions we consider the following situation .",
    "imagine we will get altogether @xmath105 quantum systems ( modes of electromagnetic field ) but we have a liberty to specify whether the specific mode is prepared in in the unknown state or in one of the two reference states . thus ,",
    "if we ask for @xmath4 copies of the unknown state we will obtain @xmath106 copies per a reference state .",
    "let us for simplicity assume that @xmath105 and @xmath4 have the same parity .",
    "the probability of identification for a reference states @xmath33 , @xmath34 then reads @xmath107 and it is maximized for @xmath108 , because the terms in the exponent are nonnegative .",
    "hence , from the point of view of the resources , it is optimal to ask for a preparation of @xmath109 unknown states and the equal number of copies per a reference state ( specifically , @xmath110 ) .",
    "unambiguous identification is a discrimination task in which we have very limited prior knowledge about the possible preparations of the quantum system we are given .",
    "the amount of information about the possible preparations is essentially given by the number of copies of the reference states we obtain . in the limit of infinite number of them the preparation of reference states",
    "become known to us and thus the ui is becoming equivalent to discrimination among _ known _ states .",
    "the unambiguous discrimination among pair of known pure states ( for equal prior probabilities ) was solved by ivanovic , dieks and peres @xcite in 1987 .",
    "their optimal measurement succeeds with a probability @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , @xmath113 are the known states in which the system can be prepared . in what follows",
    "we will show that in the aforementioned limit ( @xmath114 ) our beam - splitter setup achieves the same optimal performance . in order to prove this we have to evaluate the limit of eq .",
    "( [ puibs ] ) : @xmath115 in the last equality we have used the expression for the modulus of the overlap of the two coherent states @xmath116 . in the limit @xmath117 the two known states that could be unambiguously discriminated by the ivanovic - dieks - peres measurement are @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "thus , we see that eq .",
    "( [ puibslim ] ) is equal to @xmath111 and so our beam - splitter setup performs optimally in this limit . let us note that for @xmath120 our setup is in this limit equivalent to the setup proposed by k. banaszek @xcite for unambiguous discrimination between a pair of known coherent states . for @xmath117 our @xmath121 , @xmath122 ,",
    "i.e. the `` concentrated '' reference states are nearly reflected , which induces a displacement of the `` diluted '' unknown state @xmath32 . in the same way k.",
    "banaszek uses very unbalanced beam - splitters to cause the displacement of the outputs of the beam - splitter .    for the limiting case @xmath27 , @xmath123 it is natural to expect a classical behavior , i.e. a unit probability of identification . for",
    "unequal reference states this result is easily obtained by taking the limit of eq .",
    "( [ puibs ] ) .",
    "let us consider a basic version of ui of coherent states ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "we will describe a measurement , which in the case of success , leaves all the input states nearly unperturbed and achieves the same probability of identification as the original setup from paper i. the measurement procedure goes as follows .",
    "we first equally split each of our resource states into @xmath105 parts .",
    "thus , we have @xmath105 copies of states @xmath124 .",
    "we use the beam - splitter setup from paper i for each of these @xmath105 triples .",
    "the ui measurement performed on the first triple will succeed with probability @xmath125 . if we find @xmath93 we can combine the unmeasured @xmath126 modes into states @xmath127 .",
    "for @xmath94 we operate analogously obtaining @xmath128 .",
    "if ui measurement of the first triples fails we continue by measuring the other triples until we find a conclusive outcome or use all the triples . in case of k - th triple leading to conclusive result",
    "we concentrate the remaining resources to obtain states @xmath129 or @xmath130 depending on @xmath38 being @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "we do not get a conclusive result only if the measurements of all @xmath105 triples yield inconclusive results . hence , the overall probability of successful identification of the unknown states is @xmath131 and equals that of the optimal beam - splitter setup from paper i. however , in contrast to the setup from paper i , if a conclusive result is obtained before measuring the @xmath105-th triple we still have `` diluted '' input states at our disposal .      in the previous section",
    "the optimal values transmittivities in our beam - splitter setup were state - independent only in the case of equal number of copies per reference state .",
    "thus , for more than two types of reference states we will discuss only cases with the same number of copies of each reference state .",
    "unfortunately , we will see that even in this restricted scenario , the optimal choice of transmittivities in the setup we propose will depend on the reference states .",
    "the generalization of the beam - splitter unambiguous identification scheme from the previous subsection is straightforward .",
    "we start by preparing the `` concentrated '' states @xmath132 .",
    "we use @xmath133 beam - splitters to sequentially split the `` concentrated '' unknown state @xmath54 into @xmath7 states .",
    "each of these @xmath7 states is then merged with one of the `` concentrated '' reference states @xmath134 on beam - splitter @xmath135 .",
    "the transmittivity @xmath136 ( of beam - splitter @xmath137 ) is chosen so that destructive interference yields vacuum on the second output port of @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "these output ports are monitored by photodetectors @xmath139 .",
    "detection of at least one photon by photodetector @xmath140 unambiguously indicates @xmath141 . if all photodetectors except the @xmath47-th fire , then we conclude that @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath27 we had freedom in choosing the ratio @xmath79 with which the `` concentrated '' unknown state @xmath54 was split into two parts used for the two comparisons . in order to maximize the probability of identification we can tune @xmath133 transmittivities of the beam - splitters that result in splitting the `` concentrated '' unknown state .",
    "the optimal choice of these transmittivities even for equal prior probabilities @xmath142 depends on the choice of the reference states .",
    "once we consider @xmath143 then let us consider equal splitting of the `` concentrated '' unknown state into @xmath7 parts , even though it is not necessarily the optimal choice .",
    "in such a case the beam - splitters @xmath135 are performing the following transformation : @xmath144 the condition of @xmath145 being a vacuum for @xmath138 forces us to set the transmittivity to @xmath146 .",
    "the probability of observing at least one photon in @xmath145 if @xmath147 is @xmath148 .",
    "the corresponding probability of identification therefore reads : @xmath149 let us note that for a single copy of an unknown state and a single copy of a reference state ( @xmath150 ) the scenario is the same as in the sec .",

    "in this section we examine the information that remains in the unmeasured modes of our beam - splitter ui setups . in particular , we focus on the possibility of `` recreating '' the reference states out of those modes .",
    "this can be useful for creating a quantum database , which would not be completely destroyed by the search performed on it .",
    "instead , the data i.e. the reference states would degrade gradually with repeated use . first , we show that reference states can not be `` recreated '' without additional resources if the first unambiguous identification yields an inconclusive outcome .",

    "in this appendix we shall prove optimality of the ui setup if only linear optical elements , number resolving detectors and sources of multimode coherent states are allowed to be used .",
    "due to the fact that the linear optical transformations preserve the tensor product structure of coherent states it follows that in any measurement ( using arbitrarily many photodetectors ) the measured state is a factorized coherent state of @xmath105 modes of the form @xmath286 . in order to use an outcome of the measurement for the unambiguous conclusion the probabilities for all the other options must vanish .",
    "let us notice that for the considered family of states each photodetector measuring the individual mode has a nonvanishing probability to observe @xmath287 photons unless this mode is in the vacuum state , i.e. if @xmath288 , then @xmath289 for all @xmath287 .",

    "we shall show that the events on detectors leading to the same conclusion can be replaced by a single detector while the success probability is preserved .",
    "in other words , an experiment in which @xmath312 detectors are used to conclude that @xmath86 and @xmath313 detectors to detect that @xmath87 can be replaced by an experiment with only two photodetectors . in particular , by renaming the output ports the output vector can be rearranged into the form @xmath314 in such case we denote @xmath315 and the success probability reads @xmath316 because the ui measurement fails only if none of the conclusive detectors fire .",
