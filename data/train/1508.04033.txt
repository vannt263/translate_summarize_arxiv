    "this picture , however , is highly idealized . in reality",

    "this is both due to the finite time needed to move existing anyons towards each other , and due to the fact that we will in general need more than one round of fusion to get rid of all existing non - abelian anyons .    for abelian anyons models ( such as the toric code @xcite )",

    "i.e. , on the task of preserving a topologically stored quantum state . it is generally assumed that the thresholds for quantum information processing are identical to those for quantum information storage .",
    "our main result is that a sufficiently low rate of errors can indeed be corrected continuously , allowing in principle to preserve a topologically stored quantum state indefinitely in a sufficiently large system .",

    "@xcite , we consider a square lattice of size @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions which hosts _ ising anyons_. anyons are quasi - particles that live in 2d space , and this space needs to be discretized to allow for measurements of the local anyonic charge .",
    "our setting is thus the most generic choice that is agnostic with respect to the physical realization of the ising anyons .",
    "the chosen setting is also of interest from a coding - theoretic perspective , in that it provides an example of correcting a code without an explicit pauli - matrix tensor product structure @xcite . for proposals to realize majorana fermions in nanowire hybrid systems , which are experimentally most advanced @xcite",
    ", other geometries may be more adequate @xcite .",
    "each cell of the square lattice can carry either _ vacuum _",
    "@xmath4 , a _ fermion _",
    "@xmath5 , or a ( non - abelian ) _ anyon _ @xmath6 .",
    "these satisfy the fusion rules @xmath7 all @xmath3 charges are measured periodically at times @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that these measurements can be performed flawlessly .",
    "this assumption means that we neglect the inevitable errors that arise during the complex measurements of non - abelian anyons .",
    "however , it is common to study this ideal case in quantum error correction to establish a foundation for later studies that include measurement noise .",
    "we study the question of whether it is possible to preserve a quantum state stored in this system despite a constant rate of errors affecting it . more specifically",
    ", we consider whether it is possible to preserve a certain state of the degenerate vacuum of the system .",
    "transitions between different vacuum states can be induced by dragging fermions or anyons around the torus .",
    "more realistically , one would consider storing a quantum state in the fusion space of a set of well - separated anyons @xcite .",
    "however , we focus on the task of preserving a certain vacuum state of the torus for simplicity , since at sufficiently large length - scales , the question of correctability is independent of the particular encoding scheme chosen .",
    "let us assume that between any two rounds of charge measurement a pair of fermions and a pair of anyons are created on each pair of adjacent cells of the lattice with probability @xmath9 each ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "error events can thus be associated with edges of the square lattice .",
    "note that the case of both a pair of anyons and a pair of fermions being created on the same edge is indistinguishable from only a pair of anyons being created .",
    "we thus restrain from considering this case explicitly . hopping and",
    "braiding of anyons can emerge from pair creation processes .",
    "while in reality different processes will have different rates , we can think of @xmath9 as the probability associated with the highest - rate process .",
    "finally , we assume that we are able to move an anyon or a fermion to an adjacent cell over the course of one measurement period .",
    "our goal is to show that for sufficiently low rates @xmath9 , it is possible to perform error correction ( for any number of time - steps ) such that the probability of failure _ per error correction period _ is exponentially small in @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , a given state of the anyonic vacuum can be preserved for a time that is exponentially long in @xmath11 .    the basic idea behind",
    "our error correction approach is that it is always possible to first fuse all @xmath6 anyons in pairs , and then fuse all @xmath5 fermions in pairs in order to obtain a vacuum state @xcite .",
    "note that according to the second of the fusion rules in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fusion ] ) , if a fermion and an anyon move to the same cell , they will fuse to an anyon . if that anyon is further moved around , it will carry with it the additional fermionic charge .",
    "we will refer to this informally as the anyon `` swallowing '' the fermion .",
    "the fermion will be recovered if the anyon is brought to fusion with an other anyon , as the fermionic parity is conserved .",
    "we will thus continuously fuse the anyons in pairs , recovering any `` swallowed '' fermions . since the fermions are abelian , error correction for them can be postponted : it suffices to correct a net error after some time .",
    "this is similar to the idea of updating a pauli frame instead of performing actual corrections in a surface code ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "if we are moving two anyons towards each other in an attempt to fuse them , further errors may happen along their path that make one of them disappear .",
    "we will shortly discuss how we deal with this .    in order to formally discuss error correction",
    ", we consider a @xmath12-dimensional cubic lattice , in which time flows `` upwards '' , and with periodic boundary conditions in horizontal ( spatial ) direction .",
    "charge measurements correspond to horizontal faces .",
    "it will prove convenient to identify error events and paths along which we move anyons with edges of the _ dual _ lattice of this cubic lattice .",
    "error events happen between consecutive rounds of charge measurement and affect two adjacent cells .",
    "they can thus naturally be identified with vertical faces of the primal lattice , and , in turn , horizontal edges of the dual lattice .",
    "we will call the one - cell - per - time - step paths along which we move the anyons during error correction their _ world - lines_. error events will not be counted as part of this world - line .",
    "horizontal faces of the primal lattice ( charge measurements ) are naturally identified with vertical edges of the dual lattice . for every charge measurement which detects an anyon",
    ", we consider the associated vertical edge of the dual lattice to be part of the anyon s world - line .",
    "if an anyon is moved to an adjacent cell , the horizontal edge connecting the old and new vertical edge is also considered to be part of the anyon s world - line .",
    "note that error events always correspond to horizontal edges of the dual lattice , while anyon world - lines include both horizontal ( intentional movements ) and vertical ( charge measurements ) edges .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the union of all world - lines .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the set of all anyonic ( as opposed to fermionic ) error events and @xmath15 the set of all fermionic error events .",
    "both of these are subsets of the horizontal edges of the dual of the @xmath12-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the set of cells of the cubic lattice which have an _ odd _ number of elements of @xmath14 incident upon them .",
    "elements in @xmath16 correspond to _ unexpected changes in the anyonic charge _",

    "since the fusion rules in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fusion ] ) preserve the parity of the number of anyons that exist at any given time , the sets @xmath18 always have even cardinality .",
    "it is the task of a classical error correction algorithm to form a hypothesis about the set @xmath17 that is compatible with the given set @xmath18 .",
    "this problem is exactly identical to the well - studied problem of finding the most likely error set in a toric code with bit - flip errors and perfect syndrome measurements @xcite .",
    "we can thus employ the standard algorithm used to find such a pairing in the toric code case , namely an efficient minimum - weight perfect matching ( mwpm ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the weight of a path connecting two lattice cells is thereby given by the @xmath21-dimensional @xmath22-norm , i.e. , the manhattan distance in the @xmath3 lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we stress that despite the fact that we deal with anyon world - lines in @xmath12 dimensions , the algorithmic part of the error correction problem for the anyons is a @xmath21-dimensional one .",
    "this is in contrast to the error correction problem for the fermions .",
    "let us call a subset of the edges of the dual lattice a _ string _ if there are exactly two cells of the cubic lattice which have exactly one of the edges incident upon them , and all other cells have either zero or two edges incident upon them . the mwpm algorithm will return strings that connect the elements in @xmath18 in pairs .",
    "the union of these strings , which we call @xmath23 , forms our hypothesis about what anyonic errors have happened between charge measurements @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the union of all hypotheses up to the present time .",
    "we note that @xmath17 can in general not be decomposed into strings ending at elements of @xmath18  it can contain _",
    "these are defined as sets of edges of the dual lattice such that each cell of the cubic lattice has zero or two edges of the set incident upon them .",
    "each element in @xmath16 is connected by a string which is a subset of @xmath25 to a contemporaneous element of @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , each element in @xmath16 is the beginning or the end of an anyon world - line .",
    "this world - line connects the element either to another element in @xmath16 , which has a different time - coordinate , or to a currently existing anyon .",
    "each currently existing anyon is thus connected through a chain consisting of strings which are alternately subsets of @xmath13 and @xmath25 to another currently existing anyon .",
    "if two currently existing anyons are connected this way , we move them towards each other , one cell per time - step , along the shortest possible path which is homologically equivalent to the chain that connects them @xcite .",
    "the error correction problem for the fermions is much more involved than for the anyons because fermions are not only created and moved by elements of @xmath15 , but also by elements of @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates a process in which two fermions are created while correcting two pairs of anyons , and a process in which a fermion is `` swallowed '' during anyon error correction .",
    "both of these processes illustrate that it is possible to create pairs of fermions which do not appear in the same measurement period . for this reason ,",
    "the error correction problem for the fermions is @xmath12-dimensional .",
    "we need to pair unexpected changes of the fermionic charge which may have different time - coordinates .",
    "( since before the final time - step we never attempt to move fermions , any change in fermionic charge is unexpected .",
    ") unexpected appearances of fermions are due to fermion error events , or due to fusion of two anyons .",
    "unexpected disappearances are due to an anyon `` swallowing '' a fermion , or due to an appearance event at a location where a fermion has already been present . when applying mwpm to the fermionic problem , the weight we assign to connecting two spatio - temporally separated events is the @xmath12-dimensional @xmath22-norm .",
    "clearly , a more sophisticated weight would take knowledge about anyon world - lines into account .",
    "this would be similar to the idea of introducing `` shortcuts '' in ref .",
    "it may also help to weight spatial and temporal distances differently , and to take entropic contributions to the weight into account .",
    "however , we restrict to the @xmath22-norm for simplicity .     anyons can produce or `` swallow '' @xmath5 fermions .",

    "right process : an error string creates a pair of anyons which are brought to fusion .",
    "along one of the anyonic world - lines , a pair of fermions is created and one of the two fermions is `` swallowed '' by the nearby anyon .",
    "the second fermion is recovered only when the two anyons are fused . ]",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm ] if error correction is performed as described above , there is a finite threshold @xmath0 such that for @xmath1 the error rate per error correction period on the stored quantum information is exponentially small in @xmath11 .",
    "while we prove the existence of a finite lower bound for @xmath27 , this lower bound is very small .",
    "nevertheless , it demonstrates the important fact that the threshold is non - zero , and hence that continuous error correction for non - abelian anyons is possible in principle .",
    "we expect the value for the lower bound to be very pessimistic , and so it should not be confused for an estimated value for @xmath27 .",
    "our proof is similar in nature to the proofs for the correctability of the toric code by means of mwpm @xcite .",
    "as long as we only consider the ( non - abelian ) anyons , the error model for them is exactly identical to the one for the toric code @xcite with bit - flip rate @xmath9 and perfect syndrome measurements .",
    "the correctabiliy of the anyons thus follows from the correctability of this ( very well - studied ) error model . indeed ,",
    "@xcite contains an analytical proof that for this problem @xmath28 .",
    "our main difficulty is correcting the fermions which may be produced or `` swallowed '' during the continuous correction of the anyons , leading to a more involved , correlated effective error model for the fermions .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows two examples of such processes . from here on ,",
    "we consider the _ hypothetical completion _ of @xmath13 .",
    "that is , we consider the _ hypothetical _ world - lines @xmath13 that we would obtain if we could complete error correction in accordance with our hypothesis @xmath25 at a given time and bring all anyons to fusion , without any further errors occurring .",
    "there is thus no longer a notion of `` currently existing anyons '' .",
    "each string in @xmath13 ( anyon world - line ) begins and ends at an element of @xmath16 ( unexpected change in anyonic charge ) .",
    "the hypothetical completion of @xmath13 is introduced in order to study whether error correction has been successful up to a given time , and is used to avoid explicitly modeling a realistic fault - tolerant read - out step .",
    "we stress that no assumption is made that we can actually complete error correction without any new errors occurring in reality .",
    "similarly , we assume that the system is initially free of anyonic defects to avoid explicitly modeling a fault - tolerant read - in step .",
    "the idealized assumptions of an error - free initial state and a final fault - less period of error correction are standard in the study of fault - tolerant qubit - based quantum computation ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "while read - in and read - out will have to be performed in a fault - tolerant way in reality , we do not consider these for simplicity and in order to keep our results independent from the particular encoding scheme .",
    "we have remarked that the set @xmath14 can be decomposed into loops and strings which connect elements in @xmath16 in pairs .",
    "we choose this decomposition such that each element in @xmath16 has exactly one string incident upon it .",
    "let @xmath29 be such a decomposition .",
    "( note that the decomposition is in general not unique . )",
    "the sets @xmath30 , @xmath25 , and @xmath13 can then all be decomposed into strings , each of which ends at an element of @xmath16 .",

    "note that the sets @xmath25 and @xmath13 are not necessarily disjoint : it can happen that we attempt to move an anyon to an adjacent cell and , between the same two rounds of charge measurement , an anyonic error affecting the same two cells happens .",
    "let us thus study the disjoint union @xmath31 here , the index @xmath32 in the ordered pair @xmath33 tells us which of the three sets @xmath30 , @xmath25 , or @xmath13 the edge @xmath34 belongs to . if , for example , an edge is an element of both @xmath25 and @xmath13 , there will thus be two corresponding edges in @xmath35 .",
    "the set @xmath35 forms a trivalent graph , with each vertex corresponding to an element of @xmath16 , and having an @xmath30 , an @xmath25- , and a @xmath13-string incident upon it .",

    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denote the union of all strings in @xmath30 , @xmath25 , and @xmath13 , respectively , that belong to connected component @xmath39 .",
    "finally , let @xmath40 denote the set of horizontal edges ( i.e. , intentional anyon movements ) and @xmath41 the set of vertical edges ( i.e. , charge measurements which detect an anyon ) in @xmath38 . recall that @xmath36 and @xmath37 consist of horizontal edges only .    from the way our error correction procedure is defined , we have the inequalities @xmath42",
    "the first inequality is due to us moving anyons along the shortest path which is homologically equivalent with @xmath37 . we could always choose @xmath43 by undoing exactly the errors that happened according to our hypothesis .",
    "the second inequality is due to using mwpm for error correction .",
    "assume by contradiction that @xmath44 .",
    "then , replacing @xmath37 with @xmath36 would yield a perfect matching of the unexpected changes in anyonic charge which is of lower weight than the one returned by the mwpm algorithm , which contradicts its definition .",

    "[ lem1 ] all loops @xmath46 satisfy @xmath47    note that for the simplest possible process , a single anyon error event that is immediately corrected ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , the bound is tight .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the number of fusion events of a pair of anyons in @xmath46 .",
    "an anyon needs to be moved away from each location at which it appears .",
    "however , before fusion two anyons may be adjacent so that we need to move only one of them .",

    "<S> we thereby focus on ising anyons as the most prominent example of non - abelian anyons and show that for these a finite error rate can indeed be corrected continuously . </S>",
    "<S> there is a threshold error rate @xmath0 such that for all error rates @xmath1 the probability of a logical error per time - step can be made exponentially small in the distance of a logical qubit . </S>"
