    "from the view point of dynamical systems , _ automata _ constitute semi - group actions on trees which play the essential roles in two different subjects , where one is theory of _ automata groups _ and the other is _ discrete integrable systems_.    both subjects have been developed from the point of view of dynamical scale transform called _ tropical geometry_@xcite or _",
    "ultradiscretization_@xcite ( they are essentially the same but the original sources have been different , where the former arose in real algebraic geometry and the latter from discretization of integrable systems ) .",
    "it provides with a correspondence between automata and real rational dynamics , which by taking scaling limits of parameters , allows us to study two dynamical systems at the same time , whose dynamical natures are very different from each other .",
    "particularly it eliminates detailed activities in rational dynamics and extracts framework of their structure in automata , which allows us to induce some uniform analytic estimates@xcite .    from the computational interests ,",
    "many of the integrable systems have been discretized . in particular kdv equation @xmath0",
    "is a fundamental equation in the integrable systems , and its discretized equation has been extensively studied @xcite , as a rational dynamical systems . in @xcite ,",
    "tropical transform has been applied to the discrete kdv equation @xmath1 and the ultradiscrete kdv equation @xmath2 is obtained , which is the so - called _ box - ball systems _ ( bbs)@xcite .",
    "we verify that bbs is described by automata diagram :        which is given by a direct limit of the mealy type automata bbs@xmath3 for @xmath4 , that are the carrier capacity extensions of bbs ( see section [ sec : bbsc ] ) .",
    "moreover each bbs@xmath3 is described by automata diagram ( lemma [ lem:3.1 ] ) .",
    "rational dynamics can be regarded as approximations of the corresponding evolutional systems in partial differential equations@xcite . from the view point of dynamical scaling limits",
    ", automata can be regarded as frame - dynamics which play the roles of underlying mechanics for pde@xcite . from dynamical view point ,",
    "distribution of orbits can be measured by probability approach , which is a quite fundamental method .",
    "so far there has been little done on study of bbs from probability aspect . on",
    "the other hand study of random walk on automata group has been extensively developed .",
    "so our basic and general question is , whether the frame dynamics of integrable systems share their structural similarity with geometric properties of automata groups",
    ". it would give us much deeper understanding of dynamical structure of bbs .",
    "in @xcite , we have verified that the automaton is recursive if and only if the associated rational dynamics is quasi - recursive .",
    "quasi - recursiveness represents ` almost ' recursive which differs from periodic within uniform estimates independent of the choice of initial values . as an extension of the above property , we have applied tropical geometry to theory of automata groups to analyze global behaviour of real rational dynamical systems .",
    "a discrete group is called an _ automata group _ , if it is realized by actions on the rooted trees , which are represented by a mealy automaton .",
    "the automata group is a quite important class in group theory , which have given answers to many important questions .",
    "of particular interests for us are , counter - example to the milnor s conjecture , solution to the burnside problem on the existence of finitely generated infinite torsion groups , non - uniform exponential growth groups , etc .",
    "these applications are described in @xcite and @xcite . as an application of tropical geometry to the construction of the burnside group",
    ", we have verified that there exists a rational dynamical systems of mealy type which satisfy infinite quasi - recursiveness @xcite .",
    "this property again allows error from recursiveness which corresponds to infinite torsion , while rationality corresponds to finite generation .    in case of finitely generated groups one can consider as the space @xmath5 functions on groups and as the operator the sum of translations by chosen generators and their inverses .",
    "the study of spectra of such operators was initiated by kesten and the normalized operators are called random walk or _ transition operators _ @xcite .",
    "in general it is a very difficult problem to compute spectra of these operators .",
    "some important progresses have been achieved by studying different approximations of such operators using the representations of the group , in particular their actions on finite sets .",
    "for instance in @xcite the spectrum of the random walk operator on the heisenberg group was computed using approximations harper operators via theory of rotational algebras . in case of groups generated by automata",
    "one can study their actions on finite sequences .",
    "the simplest case when one obtains an interesting spectral information is the automaton on two states which generated the lamplighter group .",
    "all other two state automata lead to very elementary cases . in the case of bbs",
    "we do not deal with invertible transformations which would define groups .",
    "however we can still define the operators similar to random walk operators and consider their action on finite sequences .",
    "this enables us to compute the limit spectral measures for such sequences as was done for automata in @xcite .",
    "even though both bbs and automata group are constructed from mealy automata , their scopes are quite different . as a result ,",
    "one finds quite different characteristics from each other .",
    "it would be of particular interest for us to combine such properties via dynamical study of mealy automata .",
    "we want to investigate bbs systems via spectra of some operators associated to them , as it is common in non - commutative geometry .",
    "recall that both the lamplighter group and bbs act on the rooted binary tree @xmath6 .",
    "for convenience let us describe its action in the case of the lamplighter group ( see section [ sec : lamp ] ) .",
    "each state acts on the binary tree , and in this case there are two actions @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to the state set @xmath9 .",
    "it is defined inductively on each level set .",
    "the actions on the second level set are depicted as follows :        in general transition operators of automata can be given by filtration of finite rank matrices with respect to the restriction of the action on each level set .",
    "it was known that these matrices of the lamplighter automaton all satisfy stochastic property .",
    "such property is quite important for automata groups in relation to random walk on automata groups . in comparison",
    "to bbs automata , we have verified that the same property holds for all @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the filtration of the transition operators for bbs@xmath3 .",
    "they are defined in section [ sec : bbs_translation ] by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the restrictions of the representation matrices on the level @xmath13 set and the superscript @xmath14 denotes the transpose of the matrix .    the matrix @xmath15 is double stochastic for all @xmath4 , @xmath16 , i.e. the sum of each row and each column is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "it is known that there is an example of mealy automata whose transition operators do not satisfy stochastic property .",
    "the simplest case bbs @xmath18 ( bbs translation ) satisfies rather trivial behavior from dynamics view points , since it is translation .",
    "however the above proposition would suggest that bbs translation is closely related to the cases for @xmath19 .",
    "concerning bbs translation , we have discovered non trivial phenomena from spectral analysis view point .",
    "\\(i ) the spectra of the transition operators coincide with each other between the lamplighter group as an automata group and the bbs translation .",
    "it is totally discrete and dense in @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "because the eigenvalue distributions coincide , we may expect that both transition operators are mutually conjugate by some orthogonal matrices .",
    "actually we verify that it certainly holds .",
    "moreover it would be natural to ask whether the conjugation might be chosen from tree automorphisms .",
    "we have the negative answer :    there are no automorphisms of @xmath6 which conjugate between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    on the other hand , one might still ask whether it comes from permutations , or from an automorphism of the one sided shift .",
    "we have the affirmative answer , which gives the complete answer to the conjugations .",
    "let @xmath23 .",
    "let us denote the set of indices as @xmath24 .",
    "there exists a permutation matrix @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 holds .",
    "we have the explicit recurrence formulas for @xmath25 which involves the sierpinski gasket pattern .    in the cases for @xmath27 , we present numerical computations of the spectral distributions and observe that there exist structural similarities in the distributions of eigenvalues between the bbs@xmath3 and the lamplighter group .",
    "based on the observations , we give conjectures ( conjecture [ conj1 ] and [ conj2 ] ) .",
    "if one reduces an integrable system to an automaton by extracting its dynamical framework , then it should posses high symmetry , which will have some structural similarity with finitely generated groups .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate further coincidence between spectra of automata associated to integrable system and the one associated to automata groups .",
    "an _ automaton _ is defined by finite rules which can create quite complicated state dynamics over the sequences of alphabets .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be finite sets , and consider the set of all infinite sequences : @xmath30    a _ mealy automaton _",
    "@xmath31 is given by a pair of functions : @xmath32 which gives rise to the state dynamics on @xmath33 as follows .",
    "let us choose any @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "then : @xmath36 @xmath37 is determined inductively by : @xmath38 besides the dynamics over @xmath33 , the change of the state sets play important roles in a hidden dynamics .",
    "any sequences @xmath39 give dynamics by compositions : @xmath40 it can happen that different automata give the same state dynamics .",
    "in such a case , the dynamics of @xmath41 are the same , but the systems of change of state sets can be very different .",
    "such two automata are called _",
    "equivalent_.    suppose @xmath42 are permutations for all @xmath43 .",
    "if we identify @xmath33 with the rooted tree , then the mealy dynamics give the group actions on the tree , since the actions can be restricted level - setwisely .",
    "the group generated by these states is called the _ automata group _ given by the automaton @xmath44 .",
    "next we introduce the diagram expression of the automaton @xmath31 defined via the quadruple @xmath45 . in the diagram each vertex corresponds to a state @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the vertex @xmath48 is connected to the vertex @xmath49 with the directional arrow equipped with the pair of input and output strings , @xmath50 .",
    "the lamplighter group : @xmath51 is generated by canonical generators , which are @xmath52 , one copy of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , the generator of @xmath55 .    the corresponding automaton can be represented by the following diagram :        which shows that the quadruple @xmath45 of the lamplighter group as an automata group is given by @xmath56    for example , we give actions of the lamplighter automata @xmath7 and @xmath8 as follows : @xmath57    let @xmath58 be the infinite matrix representations of @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",

    ", we have two operator recursions @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath52 and @xmath66 to @xmath54 .",
    "the bbs is one of the ultradiscrete integrable systems .",
    "the bbs is composed of an array of infinitely many boxes , finite number of balls in the boxes , and a carrier of balls .",
    "each box can contain only one ball and the carrier can hold arbitrary number of balls . the evolution rule from time @xmath67 to time @xmath68 is defined as follows .",
    "the carrier moves from left to right and passes each box .",
    "when the carrier passes a box containing a ball , the carrier gets the ball ; when the carrier passes an empty box , if the carrier holds balls , the carrier puts one ball into the box .",
    "+   +   +   +   +   +   +    let us describe bbs with carrier capacity @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "in this case the carrier can hold at most @xmath69 balls .",
    "the only difference with the previous situation is that when the carrier holds @xmath69 balls and passes a box containing a ball , the carrier does nothing .",
    "similar to the case of kdv , the bbs with carrier capacity @xmath69 can be obtained from the discrete modified kdv equation @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 are constants , which reduces to the modified kdv equation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant .",
    "the bbs with carrier capacity @xmath69 is presented by @xmath74    [ lem:3.1 ] the diagram expression of the bbs with carrier capacity @xmath69 is given by        the ( simple ) bbs is obtained as the limiting case of the above automaton with @xmath75 .",
    "the state @xmath76 corresponds to the situation when the carrier holds @xmath77 balls .",
    "thus we start at the state @xmath78 . if we have 1 as the input we go from the state @xmath76 to @xmath79 if @xmath80 and we change 1 to 0 .",
    "this corresponds to the fact the carrier picks up the ball if the number of balls it already holds is @xmath80 . if we have 0 as the input we go from the state @xmath76 to @xmath81 if @xmath82 and change 1 to 0 .",
    "this corresponds to the fact the carrier puts the ball if the number of balls it already holds is at least 1 .",
    "it remains to check the situation for @xmath78 with the input 0 and for @xmath83 with the input 1 .",
    "the first one corresponds to the carrier with 0 balls passing an empty box ( it does nothing and still holds no balls ) and the last one to the carrier with @xmath69 balls passing a box with a ball ( it does nothing and still holds @xmath69 balls ) .      the bbs translation can be represented by        for example ,",
