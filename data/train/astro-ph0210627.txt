    "recent progress of numerical celestial mechanics has made it possible to accurately predict the occurrence time , position , and rate of meteoric activities ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these theories predict that meteor storms occur when the earth passes through the dense regions of meteoroids , or dust trails .",
    "the dust tubes are produced along the trails of the comet near perihelion passages and are kept in narrow tubes by combined effects of gravitational perturbations from planets and solar radiation pressure .",
    "the development of dust trail theories is important not only from celestial mechanics or interplanetary physics points of view but also from planning the strategies for protecting artificial satellites or manned missions against collisions of meteoroids ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these theories have successfully predicted the peak time of meteoric activities , no extensive verifications have been made from other aspects . since the radiant of meteors is directly related to the dust trails , the observational measurements of the radiant can be critical test for the dust trail theories . for 2001",
    "november activity of leonids meteor streams , mcnaught and asher ( 2001 ) predicted the presence of two strong outbursts ( zhr@xmath1 2000 and 8000 ) over east asian longitudes each of which is due to meteoroids released from the comet 55p / tempel - tuttle around its 1699 ( 9 revolutions ago ) and 1866 ( 4 revolutions ago ) return , respectively .",
    "we have thus made observations for verifying the dust trail theories ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our method differs from conventional ones in several ways .",
    "we use cooled ccd cameras with relatively narrow field of view optics .",
    "these instruments enable accurate ( @xmath210 arcseconds ) measurement of each meteor with reference to background fixed stars .",
    "we have also employed a new image processing technique ( @xcite ) which effectively picks up faint line shapes of meteors superposed on the background fixed stars .",
    "our aim here is not to measure the orbit of each meteor as conventionally studied but to measure the apparent radiant point projected on the celestial sphere .",
    "we therefore did not make the observations from multiple observing sites .",
    "two sky positions which subtend nearly right angle to the predicted radiant were observed .",
    "radiant is obtained as the intersections of orthogonal lines detected from the two cameras .",
    "observations were made on 2001 november 18 ut on the premises of akeno observatory ( 35@xmath047@xmath3n , 138@xmath030@xmath3e , 900 m altitude ) of institute for cosmic ray research , university of tokyo .",
    "we used unfiltered telephoto lenses with the focal lengths of 180 mm ( nikkor ) and cooled ccd cameras as summarized in table 1 .",
    "camera 1 is apogee s ap7p with the backside illuminated ccd site si-032ab ( 512@xmath4512 pixels of @xmath5m@xmath6 m ) .",
    "camera 2 is apogee s ap6e with the kodak s ccd kaf-1001e ( 1024@xmath41024 pixels of @xmath5m@xmath6 m ) .",
    "the exposures were continuously made with integration times of 20-s .",
    "readout times are 10-s and 3-s for the cameras 1 and 2 , respectively , which result in @xmath7% and @xmath8% of dead time in the observation .",
    "the pixel scales were @xmath9/pixel and @xmath10/pixel for the cameras 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "limiting magnitudes for background fixed stars were @xmath11 mag for a single frame .",
    "these cameras were placed on an equatorial mount and tracked at the sidereal rate .",
    "the pointing positions ( centers of the field of view ) , as summarized in table 1 , subtended @xmath12 to the expected radiant .",
    "camera 1 pointed at a position about @xmath13 ( minus sign means westward ) away from the radiant along right ascension while the camera 2 pointed at a position about @xmath14 ( plus sign means northward ) along the declination .",
    "the position angles of the cameras were slightly rotated from the north so that the line shapes of the meteors do not become parallel to the column or row of the ccd pixels .",
    "this setting reduces the false events due to instrumental effects ( e.g. , column defects of the chip ) .",
    "table 2 shows the start times of exposures for the first and last frames for the two cameras as well as the total number of frames .",
    "the weather condition was very good and no significant clouds bothered our abbreviations .",
    "we detect linear shapes of meteors from the obtained images and extrapolate the lines toward the radiant . the radiant",
    "is thus determined as intersections of many lines detected by the two cameras .",
    "systematic errors for the determination of lines come from several factors .",
    "first , the fixed stars revolve @xmath15 arcseconds during the integration time of @xmath16}$ ] , which leads to uniform error within @xmath17 for the current observation ( @xmath18}$ ] ) . in the current configuration , an error in the angle determination of a line corresponding to 1 pixel is magnified to @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the radiant .",
    "these two factors are combined to make total systematic error of @xmath21 .",
    "this value is marginally smaller than the expected separation ( @xmath22 ) of the two radiants corresponding to the dust tubes of 4-revolutions and 9-revolutions ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows some bright meteors as observed by the current system .",
    "this image was created by stacking 65 frames from camera 2 .    .observing instruments .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 80mm,80mm)fig1.eps",
    "the data were stored in the local hard disk and later processed offline .",
    "after dark frame subtraction and flat fielding , astrometric measurement was made for each frame with reference to usno - a 2.0 catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "the softwares pixy and imwcs were used and the field center and the rotation angle were determined for each frame .",
    "the accuracy of the astrometry ( field center ) is typically better than the pixel scale and that for the position angle is typically better than @xmath23 .",
    "we have used the new method ( @xcite ) for detecting meteors from the observed frames .",
    "this technique was originally developed for detecting trails of space debris or artificial satellites from ccd images while it can be generally used for detecting line shapes on two dimensional images in the presence of point - like backgrounds .",
    "the details of the algorithm is described in @xcite and the method is briefly explained here . each image is rotated around its center by a trial angle @xmath24 .",
    "then the central square region is extracted and the median values of each row is calculated and stored . in the absence of a line in the image , the median values are randomly distributed as background levels . if a line is present and the rotation correctly puts the line along the row , the median value becomes higher than those of adjacent rows , due to the systematic shift in the distribution of the pixel values toward higher side . since the presence of point - like stellar images does not systematically shift the distribution , this technique effectively picks up line shapes from the background stars and noise fluctuations . for detecting a line of unknown angle , we make trials with different rotation angles @xmath24 with small steps . in the current analysis",
    ", we subtracted the @xmath25-th image ( image of the previous exposure ) from the @xmath26-th image so that the effects of fixed stars and small imperfection of flat fielding are further reduced .",
    "we have examined the appropriate thresholds to discern real events ( lines ) from background fluctuations .",
    "to do this , we have created histograms of rotation angles at which the lines were detected . for bright real events ,",
    "the angles are concentrated toward the radiant , while the background events are uniformly distributed .",
    "we set the thresholds so that the signal to noise ratios are more than 2 in the histogram .",
    "consequently , the limiting magnitude of the current observation is estimated to @xmath27 mag for meteors by the cross calibration with the wide - field tv observation at the same site . as the results of the line detection analyses",
    ", we detected 9 and 80 lines from the camera 1 and 2 .",
    "the small number of detected line for the camera 1 is partly due to the presence of a stellar cluster ( m  44 = ngc  2632 ) and a bright star ( @xmath28 cnc , @xmath13.9 mag ) within the field of view which made background higher than that for the camera 2 .",
    "based on the astrometry of fixed stars , we have converted the positions of each line to the celestial coordinates ( right ascension and declination ) and extrapolated ( extended ) back to their origin on the spherical coordinates .",
    "the apparent position of radiant moves due to the combined effects of diurnal aberration and zenithal attraction .",
    "these effects smear out the apparent radiant in a short time of interval and makes it difficult to resolve the radiant structures .",
    "we therefore calculated the shift as a function of time and corrected the positions of each line to cancel the effect .",
    "the reference time for this correction was set to november 18 18:13 ut which was the predicted peak time for the 4-rev trail encounter ( @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure makes it possible to combine data of long duration to improve the statistics .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the lines are distributed around the expected position while we can clearly see the concentration at around ( @xmath29 , @xmath28)=(154@xmath0.35 , 21@xmath0.55 ) .    to clearly see the radiant ,",
    "we have examined the concentration of the lines in the following way . for each grid point near the radiant , we calculated the distance between the position and the lines . if the number of lines within the threshold distance @xmath30 is more than the threshold numbers , that positions is considered as the correct radiant .",
    "this procedure has thus three free parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 which are not given apriori .",
    "we use @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "this value of @xmath30 is chosen so that the value is comparable to the systematic error as estimated above .",
    "the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are determined by the number of detected lines .",
    "particularly , the value of @xmath31 had to be set to as small as 3 due to the small number of detected lines from the camera 1",
    ". the value of @xmath36 may be reasonable , taking into account the effective area and exposures of the two cameras .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the radiant structure as finally determined .",
    "the position derived in the current work is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction of @xcite . the measured position in declination looks displaced by @xmath37 from that predicted ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , we may not conclude that they are inconsistent , taking into account the small number of east - west lines used to constrain the declination .",
    "the better constrained right ascention is consistent with the prediction both in the central position and the extension .",
    "although we expected to resolve the two radiants from the two dust trails , they could not be resolved partly due to the small number of the east - west lines and partly due to the relatively large systematic error of the current study .",
    "we find weak evidence of shift of right ascension from ra@xmath38 to ra@xmath39 by the time resolved analysis .",
    "although it is as expected from the peak times of the two dust trails , limited statistics does not allow us to conclude that they unambiguously come from the two distinct points or from relatively extended ( @xmath40 ) region .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig2_gray.eps    ( 71mm,71mm)fig3.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)fig4.eps    the measured position is also found to be in reasonable agreement with the complementary result by using longer ( 530  mm ) focal length optics at the same observing site ( @xcite ) .",
    "since all the hardwares and softwares are independent between the two works , this agreement ensures the adequacy of the whole procedures of the two analyses .",
    "we have shown that the new method presented here can be a powerful diagnostic tool for studying the radiant structure of meteor storms .",
    "the measured position is found to be in reasonable agreement with the prediction of @xcite based on their dust trail theory .    in 2002 , leonids meteor storm is expected to be observed in north america and in europe .",
    "the observation and analysis method presented herein will be useful to further resolve the profile structure of the dust tubes .",
    "cameras with large area , fast read - out ccds such as rotse ( @xcite ) , lotis ( @xcite),and raptor ( @xcite , @xcite ) may be most useful for detecting a large number of meteors in a short time . if enough number of meteors could be detected in a short time , the three dimensional ( time resolved ) structure of dust tubes may be obtained with the current method .",
    "the authors are grateful to prof .",
    "masahiro teshima and all the staffs of akeno observatory of university of tokyo for their kind support during our observations ."
