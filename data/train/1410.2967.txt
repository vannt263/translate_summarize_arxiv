    "layered transition - metal dichalcogenides with triangular motif have been attracting renewed interest due to the discovery of superconductivity in chemically substituted irte@xmath2 @xcite and aute@xmath2 @xcite with maximum @xmath12 of 3.1 k and 4.0 k , respectively . in particular , the electronic structure of irte@xmath2 and its derivatives has been intensively studied using various spectroscopic methods under anticipation that the strong spin - orbit interaction in the ir @xmath9 and te @xmath10 orbitals may provide a novel spin - momentum entangled quantum state .",
    "@xcite also details of the structural transition in irte@xmath2 @xcite have been revealed by recent studies using advanced x - ray diffraction and scattering techniques .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , so far , electronic structure studies on aute@xmath2 and its derivatives are limited although the au @xmath9 and/or te @xmath10 electrons with strong spin - orbit interaction can provide an interesting electronic state .",
    "aute@xmath2 is known as a natural mineral calaverite with monoclinically distorted cdi@xmath2-type layered structure ( space group c2/m ) .",
    "@xcite each au - te layer contains edge - shared aute@xmath8 octahedra which are strongly distorted with two short ( 2.67 @xmath13 ) and four long ( 2.98 @xmath13 ) au - te bonds due to te - te dimer formation in the average structure .",
    "@xcite a detailed analysis of the crystal structure has revealed the incommensurate structural modulation which may indicate charge ordering of au @xmath9 and/or te @xmath10 valence electrons .",
    "@xcite although au@xmath14/au@xmath15 charge disproportionation has been suggested to explain the structural distortion , @xcite the expected au valence modulation has not been detected by x - ray photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite in addition , _ ab - initio _ calculations have indicated that the au @xmath9 subshell is almost fully occupied by electrons and the te - te dimer formation due to the partially occupied te @xmath10 subshell should be responsible for the structural distortion .",
    "@xcite very recently , kudo _ et al .",
    "_ have found that pt substitution for au suppresses the lattice distortion of aute@xmath2 and that au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 with undistorted cdi@xmath2-type ( p@xmath16m1 ) structure exhibits superconductivity with maximum @xmath12 of 4.0 k. @xcite the electronic phase diagram for au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 is similar to ir@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 , indicating intimate relationship between the lattice distortion in aute@xmath2 and the superconductivity in au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 . in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the fundamental electronic structure of au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 ( @xmath17 = 0 and 0.35 ) by means of ultra - violet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) , x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) , and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) .",
    "the valence - band ups and xps results show that the au @xmath9 and te @xmath10 orbitals are strongly hybridized near the fermi level .",
    "the core - level xps results indicate small charge distribution of the au @xmath9 electrons which is suppressed by the pt substitution",

    "the polycrystalline samples of au@xmath0pt@xmath18te@xmath2 ( x=0.35 , @xmath12=4.0 k ) and single crystals of aute@xmath2 were prepared as reported in the literature .",
    "@xcite single crystals of aute@xmath2 were cleaved for ups and xas at 300 k. ups measurements were performed at ubc using specs phoibos 150 analyzer with the he i line ( 21.2 ev ) from a monochromatized uvs300 lamp .",

    "the broad au @xmath27 peak of aute@xmath2 would be consistent with the au valence modulation due to the lattice distortion .",

    "the shoulder structures located at @xmath22 576 ev and @xmath22 587 ev for te @xmath30 and te @xmath31 are derived from te oxide contaminations which were also observed in the irte@xmath2 single crystals and the ir@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 polycrystalline samples .",
    "@xcite the shoulder structures in the aute@xmath2 single crystal and the polycrystalline au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 are much smaller than that in the polycrystalline ir@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 and are as small as that in the high quality irte@xmath2 single crystal , indicating that the surface quality of aute@xmath2 and au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 is reasonably good .    in order to clarify the effect of pt substitution",
    ", we have subtracted the core - level spectrum of au@xmath25pt@xmath26te@xmath2 from that of aute@xmath2 as displayed in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the au @xmath4 and te @xmath5 core - level peaks do not show appreciable energy shift with the pt substitution .",
    "the difference spectrum shows that the au @xmath4 core - level spectrum of aute@xmath2 gets slightly narrow with the pt substitution , while it does not affect the te @xmath5 core level appreciably .",
    "this indicates small au @xmath9 charge modulation in distorted aute@xmath2 and partial suppression of the charge modulation by the pt substitution .",
    "here , one can not fully exclude the possibility that the au valence at the surface is different from the bulk and that the surface component is enhanced in aute@xmath2 .",
    "however , the surface condition of the aute@xmath2 single crystal is expected to be better than au@xmath25pt@xmath26te@xmath2 , and the surface component in aute@xmath2 should be smaller than the polycrystalline case if it exists . on the other hand , the au 4@xmath32 peak is broader in the aute@xmath2 single crystal than the polycrystalline case .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assign the extra broadening in aute@xmath2 to the extra charge modulation instead of the surface effect .    in fig .",
    "3 , valence - band xps and ups spectra of au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 ( x=0 and 0.35 ) taken at 300 k are displayed .",
    "the valence - band ups and xps spectra of au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 show several structures .",
    "the broad structures ranging from 0 to 4 ev below the fermi level can be assigned to the te @xmath10 orbitals ( mixed with the au 5@xmath33/6@xmath34 orbitals ) on the basis of the band - structure calculations on aute@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the structures from 4.0 to 6.5 ev can be assigned to the au @xmath9 bands since it gains spectral weight in going from ups to xps , as expected from the photon energy dependence of the photoionization cross - section of au 5@xmath33 relative to te 5@xmath35 .",
    "indeed , the valence - band spectra are consistent with the calculated density of states @xcite in which the au @xmath9 bands are located in the region from 4.0 ev to 6.0 ev below the fermi level .",
    "the valence - band spectra of au@xmath25pt@xmath26te@xmath2 is shifted toward lower binding energy , indicating that the pt substitution for au may correspond to hole doping to the te @xmath10 bands mixed with the au @xmath9/@xmath11 orbitals .",
    "another possibility is that mixing of the au @xmath9 bands with the pt @xmath9 bands leads to the energy shift of the au / pt @xmath9 bands since the pt @xmath9 bands are expected to have lower binding energy than the au @xmath9 bands .",
    "the absence of the core - level energy shift is inconsistent with the former scenario ( hole doping in a rigid band manner ) and supports the latter scenario .",
    "namely , the pt substitution changes the shape of the valence band constructed from the au / pt @xmath9/6@xmath34 and te 5@xmath35 orbitals , and it can not be viewed as a simple hole doping to aute@xmath2 in a rigid band manner .",
    "the average au valence close to + 2 and the unoccupied te @xmath10 orbitals indicate that the charge - transfer energy from the te @xmath10 orbitals to the au @xmath9 orbitals is negative to stabilize the valence state of au@xmath6(te@xmath2)@xmath7 .",
    "namely , the local electronic configuration of the aute@xmath8 octahedron is close to @xmath36 ( @xmath37 represents a ligand hole in the te @xmath10 orbitals ) instead of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , each te site accommodates approximately one hole , and the te @xmath10 holes govern the transport properties and the lattice distortions in aute@xmath2 .",
    "this picture is consistent with the te - te dimers in aute@xmath2 since the antibonding molecular orbital of the te - te dimer can be occupied by the two te @xmath10 holes from the two te sites . on the other hand ,",
    "the band - structure calculations on aute@xmath2 with the average structure @xcite as well as the valence - band spectra indicate that the au @xmath9 bands are almost fully occupied . in order to resolve this apparent paradox , strong hybridization between the au @xmath9/6@xmath34 and te @xmath10 orbitals should be taken into account . starting from the au@xmath6(te@xmath2)@xmath7 valence state ,",
    "the hybridization between the au 5@xmath33/6@xmath34 orbitals and the te - te bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals can induce additional charge transfer .",
    "since the au @xmath9 level in aute@xmath2 is much lower than the ir @xmath9 level in irte@xmath2 , charge donation from the te - te bonding orbital to the au @xmath9 orbitals can be dominant in aute@xmath2 whereas back donation from the ir 5@xmath33 orbitals to the te - te antibonding orbital would be substantial in irte@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the au 6@xmath34 component can be mixed into the au 5@xmath33 bands through the strong au 5@xmath33-te 5@xmath35 and the te 5@xmath35-au 6@xmath34 hybridizations .",
    "therefore , although the `` au 5@xmath33 bands '' constructed from the atomic au @xmath9 , au 6@xmath34 , and te 5@xmath35 orbitals are fully occupied as predicted by the band - structure calculations and observed by the valence - band photoemission experiments , actual number of atomic au 5@xmath33 electrons in aute@xmath2 can remain close to nine which is consistent with the au@xmath6(te@xmath2)@xmath7 valence state .",
    "the @xmath39 configuration of au@xmath6 is consistent with the jahn - teller like distortion of the aute@xmath8 octahedra with two short and four long au - te bonds .",
    "and au@xmath25pt@xmath26te@xmath2 compared with the total and partial density of states of aute@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite , width=302 ]     xas spectrum of aute@xmath2 and au@xmath25pt@xmath26te@xmath2 .",
    "the inset shows the wide - range xas spectrum including the main edge .",
    "( b ) the te 3@xmath40 xas spectrum is compared with the calculated density of states .",
    "@xcite here , it is assumed that the fermi level is roughly located around the absorption edge.,width=377 ]    figure 4 shows the te @xmath5 xas spectrum of au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 ( x=0 and 0.35 ) . the pre - edge and main edge structures",
    "are clearly observed .",
    "the main - edge structure corresponds to transition from the te @xmath5 core level to the unoccupied te @xmath4/au @xmath11,@xmath41 states . on the other hand , the pre - edge structure",
    "can be assigned to the transition from the te @xmath5 core level to the te @xmath10 orbitals , indicating that the te @xmath10 bands cross the fermi level and that the te @xmath10 holes play essential roles in the transport properties .",
    "this te @xmath10-hole picture is consistent with the xps and xas results . in aute@xmath2 ,",
    "the te @xmath10 orbitals are partially unoccupied , and the bond formation by the te @xmath10 holes creates the te - te dimers .",
    "the te - te dimer formation leads to the long and short te - te bonds , @xcite which can induce charge modulation of au through the strong hybridization between the au @xmath9 and te @xmath10 orbitals . on the other hand",
    ", since all the te sites belong to one of the te - te dimers , each te site accommodates almost same amount of te @xmath10 hole .",
    "when pt is substituted for au in au@xmath6(te@xmath2)@xmath7 , pt ions tend to be 3 + or 4 + and supply electrons to te - te antibonding orbitals .",
    "consequently , the local te - te dimers are partly broken around the pt sites , and the superstructure due to the short te - te bond ( intradimer ) and long te - te bond ( interdimer ) is strongly disturbed . in this scenario ,",
    "disordered local te - te dimers can remain in au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 . the remaining au charge fluctuation and",
    "the disordered te - te dimers may provide anomalous lattice behaviors to au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 and may contribute to the emergence of superconductivity . @xcite",
    "we have performed photoemission and x - ray absorption measurements on au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 ( @xmath17 = 0 and 0.35 ) in which the pt substitution for au suppresses the lattice distortion in aute@xmath2 and induces the superconductivity .",
    "the broad au @xmath4 core - level peak is consistent with the au valence modulation in distorted aute@xmath2 .",
    "the au @xmath4 core - level peak gets slightly narrow with the pt substitution , indicating that small au 5@xmath33 charge modulation in distorted aute@xmath2 is at least partially suppressed by the pt substitution . the au @xmath4 and",
    "te 3@xmath33 core - level binding energies suggest that average valence state is close to au@xmath6(te@xmath2)@xmath7 consistent with the jahn - teller like distortion of the aute@xmath8 octahedra . on the other hand ,",
    "the valence - band spectra and the band - structure calculations show that the au 5@xmath33 bands are almost fully occupied .",
    "the two apparently conflicting results can be reconciled by taking account of the strong au 5@xmath33/au 6@xmath34-te 5@xmath35 hybridization .",
    "the absence of core - level energy shift with the pt substitution shows that the simple rigid band picture is not applicable to au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "although the periodic arrangement of the te - te dimers is disturbed by the pt substitution , the te - te dimers and au valence modulation may partly remain in superconducting au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 .",
    "the relationship between the possible au charge fluctuation and the superconductivity should be studied experimentally and theoretically in future .",
    "another interesting question is that the te - te dimers still remain in au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 or not .",
    "if the pt substitution causes disordering of the dimers instead of breaking , au@xmath0pt@xmath1te@xmath2 should have highly inhomogeneous electronic states similar to the fe - based superconductors .",
