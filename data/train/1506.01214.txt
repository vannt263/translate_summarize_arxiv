    "over the last several years a sustained interest has been devoted to paired fermion phases with unconventional pairing symmetry . among these the @xmath1wave spin triplet condensate",
    "has attracted particular attention .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath1wave superfluidity in fermi systems was already studied in the sixties by anderson and morel @xcite in relation to the low temperature phase of liquid @xmath3 . in the last decade",
    "there has been a renewed interest after the observation of @xmath1wave feshbach resonances in @xmath4 and @xmath5 atoms @xcite , which had raised the prospect of realizing @xmath1wave superfluidity in cold fermi gases . in particular",
    ", the possibility of controlling the strength of the interatomic interactions via feshbach resonances has stimulated theory works on the evolution of the superfluidity from the bardeen  cooper ",
    "schrieffer ( bcs ) regime to the bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) of composite bosons @xcite .",
    "we remark that a @xmath1wave superfluid phase may occur also in the fermi component of a gaseous mixture of ultracold bosons and one  component ( spin  polarized ) fermions . in that case",
    "an attractive interaction between fermions can be induced by the exchange of virtual phonons @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore properties of a three  dimensional spin ",
    "polarized fermi gas in the @xmath1wave superfluid phase using a fermion  only model . since for the @xmath1wave superfluid phase",
    "the order parameter is given by a three  dimensional object two distinct phases are available to the superfluid . a @xmath2 phase , which is characterized by the @xmath6component of the pair angular momentum @xmath7 equal to @xmath8 and a @xmath9 phase with @xmath10 . at low temperatures the system can undergo a phase transition from a @xmath9 to a @xmath2 superfluid state @xcite .",
    "moreover , detuning the fesh- bach resonance the system can exhibit a transition from a gapless quasiparticle spectrum for positive values of the chemical potential @xmath11 ( bcs  side ) to a gapped spectrum for @xmath12 ( bec  side ) @xcite .",
    "we will address in particular the study of low  energy collective modes in the limit of vanishing temperature .",
    "the threshold for pair  breaking vanishes in the bcs  side .",
    "so the collective modes in general should be strongly damped in the bcs  side .",
    "for this reason , we will consider collective excitations of the fermi superfluid in the bec phase only .",
    "collective modes in a @xmath1wave superfluid fermi gas have been already studied in ref .",
    "however , in that paper calculations were performed only for the @xmath9 superfluid phase . moreover , the authors reported dispersion relations only for the nambu  goldstone mode related to phase  oscillations of the pairing field .",
    "we aim to do a step further .",
    "we consider the system in the @xmath2 phase , which represents the true ground state , and we extend calculations to collective modes given by amplitude fluctuations of the pairing field .",
    "furthermore , we derive from the properties of the superfluid fermi gas in the bec side the structure of the corresponding bose counterpart and the interaction between the composite bosons . since the order parameter of the fermion superfluid phase is represented by a complex vector the boson gas can be considered as a bose spinor condensate .",
    "we compare the dispersion relations for the collective modes of the fermi system with the corresponding ones of the bose condensate . from an experimental point of view the observation of the peculiarities of the excitation spectrum may help to assess the occurrence of a bec regime in a @xmath1wave superfluid fermi gas @xcite .",
    "in the imaginary  time functional formalism an effective action for the pairing field can be obtained by using a stratonovich  hubbard transformation for the couples of fermion fields ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . after integration of the fermionic part",

    "the pairing field at equilibrium , @xmath27 , is evaluated within the saddle ",

    "only solutions with vanishing center of mass momentum are considered . in this case",
    "the gap equation becomes @xmath33    now , we expand the effective action @xmath28 up to the second order in the fluctuations of the pairing field @xmath34 and for the effective action of the fluctuations we get @xmath35 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{{\\bf p},{\\bf k } } \\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau d\\tau^{\\prime}\\big[{\\widehat\\sigma}^\\dag({\\bf p},{\\bf k},\\tau ) { \\widehat a}(\\tau-\\tau^{\\prime},{\\bf p},{\\bf k } ) { \\widehat\\sigma}({\\bf p},{\\bf k},\\tau^{\\prime})\\big]\\ , ,   \\label{gauss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the vector @xmath36 and the matrix @xmath37 given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq.([gauss ] ) we have introduced the @xmath40 matrix + @xmath41 whose elements are @xmath42 where the green functions in the r.h.s . are calculated for the gas at equilibrium . then , they are diagonal in the momenta . from general properties of the green functions",

    "this can simply be accomplished by substituting in the expressions for the matrix elements @xmath47 the imaginary  time green functions with their real ",
    "time counterparts .",
    "then , we recast eq.([prop1 ] ) in the real  frequency representation @xmath48    here , we consider a gas in the limit of vanishing temperature @xmath49 . in this case",
    "the matrix elements @xmath50 are explicitly given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 while the remaining matrix elements are determined by the symmetry relations @xmath53 @xmath54 in the above equations we have used the notations @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the quasiparticle energy , @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",

    "in this paper we are concerned with the fluctuations of the pairing field in the stable phase @xmath2 . the ground  state energy and the chemical potential are determined by the magnitude @xmath98 alone . in order to calculate @xmath99 we choose a particular direction for the vectors @xmath100 and @xmath101 , say @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , we observe that once the value of the cut  off @xmath74 is fixed , the scaled quantity @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the fermi energy , depends only on the dimensionless effective coupling constant @xmath106 which is a function of the product @xmath107 and of the scaled cut  off @xmath108 . in terms of the parameter @xmath109 the equation for @xmath110 reads @xmath111 with @xmath112 and momenta expressed in units of the fermi momentum : @xmath113 .",

    "we notice that in the present case the spins of the fermions do not play any role since they are frozen along a fixed direction and there is no coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "we expect the occurrence of nambu ",
    "goldstone modes related both to the phase fluctuations of the @xmath124 component of the pairing field and to the fluctuations of the amplitudes of the pairing field .",
    "actually , by exploiting the gap equation one can see that eqs .",
    "( [ amplm ] ) show solutions with @xmath125 for vanishing momentum @xmath126",
    ". however , this does not give rise in general to undamped phonon  like excitations .",
    "this occurs because for particular directions of the momentum the energy gap vanishes , so that in the bcs side the phonon  like modes can merge in the continuum of ungapped two  quasiparticle excitations .",
    "wave energy gap as a function of @xmath127 for two values of the momentum cut  off : @xmath128 ( red circles ) and @xmath129 ( blue circles ) . ]",
    "the threshold for the quasiparticle continuum is given by the minimum value of the sum @xmath130 .",
    "the most favorable case is when @xmath117 is `` parallel '' to the complex vector @xmath121 . in this case",
    "the threshold is given by @xmath131 , and only phonon  like modes with a phase velocity such that @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the fermi velocity , can propagate without damping .",
    "explicit calculations show that this requirement can be satisfied only for large energy gaps .",
    "the corresponding values of the interaction strength are in the region close to the bcs ",
    ". we should point out that our calculations are essentially performed within the framework of a mean  field theory .",
    "the extension of the present approach to a critical region , where fluctuations of the pairing field could be important , can be rather questionable .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss collective modes in the bcs side and focus our attention on the collective excitations of the fermi gas inside the bec phase .",
    "the scaled energy gap @xmath110 and the chemical potential together with the energy per particle are reported in figs .",

    "figure ( 2 ) shows a remarkable closeness between the chemical potential and the energy per particle , the two sets of points are practically indistinguishable .",

    "the situation is quite different .",

    "condensate counterpart .",
    "the superfluid @xmath2 phase and the corresponding ferromagnetic phase for the bec break both the rotational symmetry and the @xmath123 symmetry under global gauge transformations .",
    "however , @xmath123 transformations can make up for spatial rotations about the original @xmath136 axis , i.e. the ground state displays a `` spin  gauge '' symmetry @xcite . so that a @xmath123 symmetry is still maintained .",
    "this reduces to @xmath188 the number of spontaneously broken group",

    "for a sufficiently diluted atomic fermi gas with only one component , the interaction between atoms can be considered effective only in the @xmath1channel . the transition from the bcs to the bec regime",

    "@xcite for the bec regime . in the latter paper calculations were performed within a coupled fermion  boson model for a @xmath1wave feshbach resonance .",
    "we expect that the collective modes are strongly damped in the bcs side .",
    "thus , we have studied the low  energy excitation spectrum only in the bec phase . in this phase",
    "the dispersion relations of the collective modes show peculiar features , which might also be relevant for the transport properties of the system . besides an excitation mode with the usual phonon  like dispersion relation , a gapped mode and a single  particle  like mode can occur . however , these features are consistent with the goldstone theorem . moreover , when the superfluid fermi gas is well inside the bec phase the chemical potential and the energy per particle approach each  other .",
    "this suggests that the pairs of fermions behave as a bose ",
    "einstein condensate with a weak repulsive interaction acting between composite bosons .",
    "finally , a comparison has been performed between the dispersion relations of the fermi ",
    "gas collective modes and the corresponding ones of a bose spinor condensate calculated by means of the time ",
    "dependent gross  pitaevskii equations .",
    "they coincide to a high accuracy .",
    "then , there is a tight similarity between a @xmath1wave superfluid fermi gas in the bec side and a bose spinor condensate for both the equilibrium properties and the dynamical behavior at low energy .",
    "a final comment is in order . in a mean",
    " field approximation retardation effects , arising from the renormalization of the effective interaction between fermions in a medium , are neglected . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the energy and momentum dependence of the interaction plays a significant role in determining the @xmath1wave pairing gaps in a superfluid fermi gas .",
    "then , we should expect that , from a quantitative point of view , the inclusion of such effects might affect the results , presented in the present paper , appreciably .",
