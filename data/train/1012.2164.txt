    "by applying the physical - layer network coding @xcite or analogue network coding ( anc ) @xcite in two - way relaying ( twr ) , only two time slots are required for one complete information exchange using twr . in the first time slot ,",
    "both source nodes transmit simultaneously to the relay . in the second time slot ,",
    "the relay broadcasts the common message which is obtained by combining the received messages . since both source nodes know their own transmitted signals , each of their self - interference can be completely canceled prior to decoding .",
    "the twr has been studied in @xcite to @xcite for the case of single source pair .",
    "the beamformer design for af - based multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) twr is studied in @xcite@xcite , in which the receive and transmit beamforming are derived separately and then combined to form the relay beamformer .",
    "furthermore , some strategies to enhance the performance of twr can be found in @xcite to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the non - anc - based twr for multiple source pairs is studied in @xcite to @xcite .",
    "unlike the single source pair case , in multiple source pairs scenario , additional inter - pair interference exists between different source pairs , which degrades the twr performance . in @xcite ,",
    "a relay network with multiple source pairs and multiple relay nodes is studied , where all sources and relay stations have multiple antennas .",
    "the multiuser twr is proposed and studied in @xcite , where multiple source pairs are communicating via multiple relays . in @xcite @xcite , the mimo twr where multiple wireless node pairs are communicating via a single decode - and - forward ( df ) relay",
    "is studied .    due to",
    "the presence of inter - pair interference , previous beamforming solutions for twr with single source pair is no longer useful and new solutions are required for the case of multiple source pairs . in almost all the above works @xcite to @xcite , the inter - pair interference are canceled using zero - forcing ( zf)-based approach .    in this paper ,",
    "two new non - zf - based beamforming schemes or beamformers are proposed for anc - based twr . instead of completely canceling the inter - pair interference for all source pairs by zf - based methods as was done in previous works ,",
    "we propose joint grouping and beamforming scheme that divides a given large number of source pairs into smaller subgroups , and then apply the proposed beamformers to each subgroup . to the best of our knowledge , this approach has not been studied in previous works .",
    "simulation results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed schemes .",
    "we study wireless twr with a multi - antenna relay and a total number of @xmath0 single - antenna sources , where @xmath0 is an even number . due to the fact that the inter - pair interference contains the desired signals of all the other sources ,",
    "these desired signals are also suppressed by any suboptimal beamformer which causes significant loss in the sinr , especially when @xmath0 is large .",
    "we propose to overcome that this shortcoming by first dividing a large number of @xmath0 source pairs into @xmath1 subgroups , each with a smaller number of @xmath2 source pairs , where @xmath2 is an even number .",
    "then , by using time division approach , the relay performs non - zf - based beamforming on each subgroup of users at one time , and take turn to serve all source pairs , to achieve a better throughput performance .",
    "next , we consider a given subgroup of @xmath2 sources , and derive twr beamformers for these @xmath2 sources .    without loss of generality , we assume the @xmath3-th source node @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is to exchange information with another source @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
