    "three - dimensional maps of the large - scale distribution of galaxies reveal a rich network of filaments and sheets , punctuated by dense clusters and interleaved with low density tunnels and bubbles @xcite .",
    "different classes of galaxies trace this structure differently , with early type galaxies residing preferentially in rich groups and clusters and late type galaxies residing preferentially in the filaments and walls ; this segregation of clustering was already evident in two - dimensional studies as early as @xcite .",
    "galaxy surveys map the distribution of visible baryons , but a combination of observational and theoretical arguments , beginning with zwicky ( @xcite , @xcite ) , show that the galaxies trace an underlying network of invisible , gravitationally dominant dark matter . in this paper , we measure the clustering of galaxies as a function of luminosity and color in the largest galaxy redshift survey to date , the main galaxy sample @xcite of the seventh data release ( dr7 ; @xcite ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "our primary tool is the two - point correlation function @xmath16 , which provides a simple , robust , and informative measure of galaxy clustering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , we focus on the projected correlation function @xmath0 , which integrates out redshift - space distortions caused by galaxy peculiar velocities @xcite . by modeling our measurements in the context of the @xmath5cdm cosmological framework ( inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) , we infer the relation between different classes of galaxies and the underlying distribution of dark matter , providing fundamental tests for theories of galaxy formation .    over the last few decades",
    ", a variety of `` local '' clustering studies have established an increasingly refined and quantitative characterization of the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity , morphology , color , and spectral type ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "luminous galaxies generally cluster more strongly than faint galaxies , reflecting their tendency to reside in denser environments . galaxies with bulge - dominated morphologies , red colors , or spectral types indicating old stellar populations also exhibit stronger clustering and a preference for dense environments .",
    "significant progress has also been made in recent years in measuring galaxy clustering at intermediate and high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological inferences from galaxy clustering measurements are complicated by the existence of galaxy bias , the difference between the distribution of galaxies and that of the underlying dark matter . while the gravitational clustering of dark matter from specified initial conditions can be computed reliably with cosmological @xmath17-body simulations , the detailed physics of galaxy formation  gas cooling , star formation , and the feedback effects of star formation and black hole accretion",
    " is only partly understood , so galaxy bias can not be predicted robustly from first principles .",
    "cosmological parameter studies must adopt a mathematical description of galaxy bias and marginalize over its uncertain parameters .",
    "this procedure is most straightforward at large scales , where the effects of bias are expected to be simple , i.e. , a scale - independent amplification of the matter @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "conversely , for a specified cosmological model , one can constrain detailed descriptions of galaxy bias and thus gain insights into galaxy formation physics .    in the cold dark matter scenario @xcite , which is now supported by a wide range of observational evidence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , galaxies form and reside in extended dark matter halos .",
    "the existence of such halos is well established by studies of spiral galaxy rotation curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the stellar dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) and gravitational lensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) of elliptical galaxies . studies of weak lensing and satellite galaxies show that the halos of luminous galaxies extend to hundreds of kpc , where they join smoothly onto the larger scale distribution of dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of dark matter halos is dominated by gravity and can be well predicted for a given cosmology from high - resolution numerical simulations and analytic models .",
    "dark matter halos thus become the natural bridge for connecting the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution .    in recent years",
    ", the theoretical understanding of galaxy clustering has been enhanced through development of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) framework ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hod formalism describes the `` bias '' relation between galaxies and mass at the level of individual dark matter halos , in terms of the probability distribution that a halo of virial mass @xmath18 contains @xmath17 galaxies of a given type , together with prescriptions for the relative spatial and velocity bias of galaxies and dark matter within virialized halos .",
    "the combination of a cosmological model and a fully specified hod can predict any galaxy clustering statistic on any scale , allowing integrated constraints from many observations . for an assumed cosmological model and a parameterized form of the hod motivated by contemporary theories of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , measurements of @xmath0 are already highly constraining , and hod",
    "modeling transforms data on galaxy pair counts into a physical relation between galaxies and dark matter halos .",
    "hod modeling has been applied to interpret clustering data from a number of surveys at low and high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ; zheng , coil & zehavi 2007 ; @xcite ) .    in principle , a complete model of galaxy bias might need to allow for the possibility that the average galaxy content of halos depends on large - scale environment as well as halo mass , since halo concentrations and assembly histories show some environmental correlations @xcite .",
    "however , studies assuming an environment - independent hod have proven successful at explaining galaxy clustering in different density regimes ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and theoretical models predict only a small impact of such `` halo assembly bias '' on galaxy clustering statistics for mass- or luminosity - thresholded samples @xcite .",
    "the present paper builds upon our investigation of galaxy correlations in early sdss redshift data @xcite , our use of hod modeling to interpret deviations from a power - law in the galaxy two - point correlation function @xcite , and , especially , our earlier investigation of luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy correlation function in a sample of about 200,000 sdss galaxies ( zehavi et al .",
    "2005b , hereafter z05 ) . here",
    "we take advantage of the final sdss galaxy sample  roughly three times more galaxies once appropriate cuts are applied  and advances in hod modeling methods to obtain higher precision measurements and tighter , more informative constraints on galaxy - halo relations .",
    "this study complements correlation function measurements and hod models of the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample @xcite , which probes the most luminous galaxies out to redshift @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we focus our analysis on volume - limited samples of well defined galaxy classes , which allows us to construct hod models with a small number of free parameters to interpret the measurements for each class .",
    "this approach complements other analyses of the sdss main galaxy sample that measure luminosity or stellar mass - weighted correlation functions @xcite or use marked correlation functions to quantify luminosity and color dependence @xcite .",
    "these analyses typically yield smaller error bars because they use more sample galaxies for the measurement , but they require a more complete global description of the galaxy population to model the results .",
    "there are many parallels between our program and the one pursued by van den bosch , mo , yang , and their collaborators ( e.g. , papers cited above and @xcite ) , though they have largely focused on analysis of group catalogs @xcite rather than detailed fitting of the correlation function .",
    "the two approaches yield qualitatively similar results ( e.g. , z05 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our correlation function measurements provide basic empirical characterizations of large - scale structure at low redshift ( @xmath20 ) , and the luminosity and color dependence of these correlation functions can test predictions from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) or semi - analytic models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the derived hod constraints provide informative tests of galaxy formation models , a low redshift baseline for evolutionary studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a description that can be used to create realistic mock catalogs from simulations ( @xcite ; mcbride et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ". as discussed extensively by @xcite , the hod formalism can also be used in cosmological parameter determinations , allowing marginalization over the parameters of a bias prescription that applies to a wide range of clustering statistics from the linear to the highly non - linear regime .",
    "combinations of spatial clustering statistics and dynamically sensitive measures ( such as galaxy - galaxy lensing , redshift - space distortions , or group and cluster mass - to - light ratios ) can break the main degeneracies between cosmological parameters and galaxy bias .",
    "a number of papers have implemented variants of this approach to constrain the matter density parameter @xmath21 and the amplitude of matter clustering @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these analyses argued for a significant downward revision of the wmap1 values of @xmath21 and/or @xmath22 , anticipating the parameter changes that occurred with wmap3 ( see also @xcite , who reached a similar conclusion by a related method ) .",
    "our correlation function measurements are providing essential constraints for such analyses using the sdss dr7 data set .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes the sdss data and the methods we use to measure galaxy clustering and to interpret it via hod modeling . in  [ sec : lum ] we present results on the luminosity dependence of @xmath0 and its implications for hod models . in ",
    "[ sec : color ] we examine the dependence of clustering on galaxy color , including cross - correlations between red and blue galaxy samples , and we investigate the luminosity dependence for red and blue galaxies separately .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our results .",
    "appendix a discusses some technical issues relating to predictions of the galaxy cross - correlation function .",
    "appendix b illustrates the robustness of our measurements to different systematics .",
    "appendix c presents in tabular form the @xmath0 measurements for most of the samples discussed in the paper .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) was an ambitious project to map most of the high - latitude sky in the northern galactic cap , using a dedicated 2.5 meter telescope @xcite .",
    "the survey started regular operations in april 2000 and completed observations ( for sdss - ii ) in july 2008 .",
    "a drift - scanning mosaic ccd camera @xcite imaged the sky in five photometric bandpasses @xcite to a limiting magnitude of @xmath23 .",
    "the imaging data were processed through a series of pipelines that perform astrometric calibration @xcite , photometric reduction @xcite and photometric calibration @xcite .",
    "objects were selected for spectroscopic followup using specific algorithms for the main galaxy sample @xcite , luminous red galaxies @xcite , and quasars @xcite .",
    "targets were assigned to spectroscopic plates using an adaptive tiling algorithm @xcite and observed with a pair of fiber - fed spectrographs .",
    "spectroscopic data reduction and redshift determination were performed by automated pipelines .",
    "galaxy redshifts were measured with a success rate greater than @xmath24 and typical accuracy of @xmath25 . to a good approximation ,",
    "the main galaxy sample consists of all galaxies with petrosian magnitude @xmath26 , with a median redshift of @xmath27 .",
    "the lrg redshift sample uses color - magnitude cuts to select galaxies with @xmath28 that are likely to be luminous early - type galaxies , extending up to redshift @xmath29 .",
    "galaxy samples suitable for large - scale structure studies have been carefully constructed from the sdss redshift data @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes are k - corrected @xcite and evolved to rest - frame magnitudes at @xmath30 ( which is near the median redshift of the sample and thus minimizes corrections ) using an updated version of the evolving luminosity function model of @xcite@xmath31 . the radial selection function is derived from the sample selection criteria .",
    "when creating volume - limited samples below , we include a galaxy if its evolved , redshifted spectral energy distribution places it within the main galaxy sample s apparent magnitude and surface brightness limits at the limiting redshift of the sample . the angular completeness is characterized carefully for each sector ( a unique region of overlapping spectroscopic plates ) on the sky .    due to the placement of fibers to obtain spectra , no two targets on the same plate can be closer than @xmath32 .",
    "this results in @xmath33 of targeted galaxies not having a measured redshift .",
    "we assign these galaxies the redshift of their nearest neighboring galaxy ; roughly speaking , this method double - weights the galaxy that _ was _ observed , but it retains the additional information present in the angular position of the `` collided '' galaxy . as shown in z05 , this treatment works remarkably well for projected statistics such as @xmath0 , above the physical scale corresponding to @xmath32 ( @xmath34 at the outer edge of our sample ) .",
    "we thus limit the measurements in this paper to scales larger than that .",
    "the median deviation of @xmath0 for the range of separations we utilize is 0.2% , much less than the statistical errors on the measurements ( fig .  3 in z05 ) .",
    "it is , in fact , possible to correct for fiber collisions down to scales as small as @xmath35 using the ratio of small - angle pairs in the spectroscopic and photometric catalogs @xcite , but we have not implemented this technique here .",
    "the clustering measurements in this paper are based on sdss dr7 @xcite , which marks the completion of the original goals of the sdss and the end of the phase known as sdss - ii .",
    "the associated nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ) includes approximately @xmath36 main sample galaxies over about 8000 deg@xmath3 on the sky .",
    "this data set can be compared to the much smaller sky coverage of the samples in previous correlation function analyses of the sdss main galaxy sample : @xcite used an early sample of @xmath37 deg@xmath3 , and z05 analyzed a sample of about @xmath38 deg@xmath3 .",
    "the contiguous northern footprint of dr7 offers further advantage over earlier data sets by reducing boundary effects .",
    "figures  [ fig : pie]-[fig : pie_lum ] show the distribution of the main sample galaxies in right ascension and redshift for slices near the celestial equator .",
    "these plots nicely illustrate the large - scale structure we aim to study using the two - point correlation function , as well as the potential dependencies on galaxy properties .",
    "diagrams that show contiguity of structure over multiple sdss slices appear in @xcite , who analyze the topology of large scale structure in the dr7 main galaxy sample .    throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to distances in comoving units , and for all distance calculations and absolute magnitude definitions we adopt a flat @xmath5cdm model with @xmath39 .",
    "we quote distances in @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 ) , and we quote absolute magnitudes for @xmath42 .",
    "our correlation function measurements are strictly independent of @xmath43 , except that the absolute magnitudes we list as @xmath44 are really values of @xmath45 . changing the assumed @xmath21 or @xmath46 would have a small impact on our measurements by changing the distance - redshift relation and thus shifting galaxies among luminosity bins and galaxy pairs among radial separation bins .",
    "however , even at our outer redshift limit of @xmath47 , the effect of lowering @xmath21 from 0.3 to 0.25 is only 1% in distance , so our measurements are effectively independent of cosmological parameters within their observational uncertainties .    in order to work with well - defined classes of galaxies , we study volume - limited samples constructed for varying luminosity bins and luminosity thresholds .",
    "while volume - limited subsamples include fewer galaxies than the full flux - limited sample , they are much easier to interpret . for a given luminosity bin , we discard the galaxies that are too faint to be included at the far redshift limit or too bright to be included at the near limit .",
    "we include galaxies with @xmath48 , with the conservative bright limit imposed to avoid small incompletenesses associated with galaxy deblending ( the nyu - vagc ` afe   ` amples ) .",
    "we further cut these samples by color , using the k - corrected @xmath49 color as a separator into different populations .",
    "we also study a set of luminosity - threshold samples , namely volume - limited samples of all galaxies brighter than a given threshold , as these yield higher precision measurements than luminosity - bin samples and are somewhat more straightforward for hod modeling . for these samples",
    "we relax the bright flux limit to @xmath50 , in order to be able to define a viable volume - limited redshift range ( the nyu - vagc ` right   samples ) .",
    "the distri`ution in magnitude and redshift and the cuts used to define the samples are shown in figure  [ fig : samples ] .",
    "details of the samples are given in tables  [ table : bins ] and [ table : thres ] .",
    "for luminosity - threshold samples , one could improve statistics by using the flux - limited galaxy catalog and weighting galaxy pairs by the inverse volume over which they can be observed , as done by @xcite for samples weighted by stellar mass and luminosity .",
    "this procedure would extend the outer redshift limit for the more luminous galaxies above the threshold , thus reducing sample variance , but it has the arguable disadvantage of using different measurement volumes for different subsets of galaxies within the sample , and we have not implemented it here .",
    "the full spectroscopic survey of the sdss dr7 legacy survey contains 900,000 unique , survey - quality galaxy spectra over 8000 deg@xmath3 . of these objects ,",
    "the main galaxy sample target criteria selected 700,000 .",
    "sdss targeted the remainder as luminous red galaxy candidates ( around 100,000 ) or in other categories ( e.g. , as quasar candidates or in special programs on the equator ) .",
    "we use a reduced footprint of 7700 deg@xmath3 , which excludes areas of suspect photometric calibration @xcite and incomplete regions near bright stars .",
    "this reduction leaves 670,000 main sample galaxies . because we are using an updated photometric reduction , a substantial fraction of targets",
    "are assigned fluxes fainter than the original flux limit , which further reduces the sample to about 640,000 galaxies . for uniformity",
    "we have imposed an even stricter faint limit of @xmath51 in this paper , which yields 540,000 galaxies .",
    "about 30,000 of the original targets at that flux limit were not assigned fibers because of fiber collisions ; we assign these objects the redshift of their nearest neighbor as discussed above .",
    "the resulting sample of 570,000 galaxies constitutes the parent sample for all of the volume - limited samples in this paper .",
    "when we apply a bright magnitude cut of @xmath52 , it eliminates about 6,000 galaxies .",
    "further details and the samples themselves are available as part of the public nyu - vagc datasets .      the auto - correlation function is a powerful way to characterize galaxy clustering , measuring the excess probability over random of finding pairs of galaxies as a function of separation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to separate effects of redshift distortions from spatial correlations ,",
    "it is customary to estimate the galaxy correlation function on a two - dimensional grid of pair separations parallel ( @xmath53 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath54 ) to the line of sight .",
    "following the notation of @xcite , for a pair of galaxies with redshift positions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we define the redshift separation vector @xmath57 and the line - of - sight vector @xmath58 .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular separations are then @xmath59 to estimate the pair counts expected for unclustered objects while accounting for the complex survey geometry , we generate volume - limited random catalogs with the detailed angular selection function of the samples . for the different galaxy samples , we use random catalogs with 25 - 300 times as many galaxies , depending on the varying number density and size of the samples .",
    "we have verified that increasing the number of random galaxies or replacing the random catalog with another one makes a negligible difference to the measurements .",
    "we estimate @xmath60 using the @xcite estimator @xmath61 where dd , dr and rr are the suitably normalized numbers of weighted data - data , data - random and random - random pairs in each separation bin .",
    "we weight the galaxies ( real and random ) according to the angular selection function ; because we are using volume - limited samples , we do not weight by a radial selection function .",
    "we also tested the alternative @xmath62 estimators of @xcite and @xcite and found only small differences in the measurements .",
    "see appendix  [ sec : systematics ] for these and other tests of our standard analysis procedures .    to examine the real - space correlation function ,",
    "we follow standard practice and compute the projected correlation function @xmath63 in practice , for most samples we integrate up to @xmath64 , which is large enough to include most correlated pairs and gives a stable result by suppressing noise from distant , uncorrelated pairs . for samples with low outer redshift limits we use @xmath65 ( see tables  [ table : bins ] and  [ table : thres ] ) .",
    "we use these @xmath66 values consistently when performing hod modeling of the clustering results ( not including the small residual effects of redshift - space distortions ) .",
    "we use linearly spaced bins in @xmath53 with widths of @xmath67 .",
    "our bins in separation @xmath54 are logarithmically spaced with widths of 0.2 dex .",
    "we checked the robustness to binning in @xmath54 and @xmath53 and found our results to be insensitive to either .",
    "the measurements are quoted at the pair - weighted average separation in the bin .",
    "we estimate that this separation varies by at most 1% from the @xmath54 for which @xmath68 equals the pair - weighted average of @xmath69 in the bin .",
    "this corresponds to a change of the same magnitude in @xmath69 , significantly smaller than the statistical errors on the measurements , and an up to 0.5% shift in the best - fit correlation length .",
    "the projected correlation function can be related to the real - space correlation function , @xmath70 , by @xmath71 @xcite . in particular , for a power - law @xmath72 , one obtains @xmath73 allowing one to infer the best - fit power - law for @xmath70 from @xmath69 .",
    "alternatively , one can invert @xmath69 to get @xmath70 independent of the power - law assumption . here , however , we focus on @xmath69 itself , as this is the statistic measured directly from the data that is determined by the real - space correlation function .",
    "we note that equation  ( [ eq : wp3 ] ) strictly holds only in the limit of integrating to infinity to obtain @xmath69 . for most of our measurements used in the fits , however , @xmath74 , and this has a minimal effect . in this paper",
    ", we focus on hod modeling of the measurements ( using the finite @xmath66 values consistently ) and provide power - law fits only as qualitative guidelines , but see @xcite for a possible way to modify the power - law fitting .",
    "we estimate statistical errors on our different measurements using jackknife resampling , as in z05 .",
    "we define 144 spatially contiguous subsamples of the full data set , each covering approximately 55 deg@xmath3 on the sky .",
    "our jackknife samples are then created by omitting each of these subsamples in turn .",
    "the error covariance matrix is estimated from the total dispersion among the jackknife samples , @xmath75 where @xmath76 in our case , and @xmath77 is the mean value of the statistic @xmath78 measured in radial bin @xmath79 in all the samples ( @xmath62 denotes here the statistic at hand , whether it is @xmath62 or @xmath69 ) .",
    "in z05 we used @xmath80 for the smaller sample .",
    "the larger value here is chosen to enable better estimation of the full covariance matrix , while still allowing each excluded subvolume to be sufficiently large .",
    "@xcite have recently studied a variety of error estimators for dark matter correlation functions in n - body simulations , comparing internal methods such as jackknife and bootstrap to external estimates derived from multiple independent catalogs , each comparable in size to our @xmath15 galaxy samples .",
    "they find good agreement between jackknife and external estimates for the variance in @xmath0 on large scales , with jackknife errors somewhat overestimating the externally derived errors on small scales ( @xmath81 ) . our own tests of the jackknife method on pthalos mock catalogs @xcite , described by zehavi et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 ) and z05 , show that it yields error and covariance estimates similar to those derived from multiple independent catalogs ( see z05 , figure 2 ) . in principle ,",
    "covariance matrices derived from large numbers of realistic mock catalogs are preferable because they use larger total volumes and include cosmic variance on scales of the full survey ( while jackknife or bootstrap estimates only include cosmic variance on the scale of individual subsamples ) . however , the tests mentioned above suggest that jackknife estimates are sufficient for our purposes , and they are a far more practical tool when working with many subsamples of different clustering properties , as the mock catalog approach would require a new set of realizations mimicking the clustering signal of each one .",
    "the @xcite tests suggest that parameter uncertainties derived using the jackknife errors should , if anything , be conservative . because of potential noise or systematics in jackknife estimates of the full covariance matrix",
    ", we also present some model fits below that use only diagonal elements .",
    "we interpret the clustering measurements in the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , which describes the bias between galaxies and mass in terms of the probability distribution @xmath82 that a halo of virial mass @xmath18 contains @xmath17 galaxies of a given type .",

    "figure  [ fig : wp_vl_z ] compares projected correlation functions of adjacent luminosity bins when using their respective full volume - limited redshift range ( points with error bars ) and when restricting both to their common overlap range ( lines ) .",
    "the overlap volume is similar to the full volume of the fainter sample ( differing only because of the @xmath171 bright limit ) , so the filled points and solid lines are usually in close agreement .",
    "the most significant cosmic variance effect on the measurements appears to be due to the sloan great wall ( sgw ) , a huge supercluster at @xmath172 , which is the largest coherent structure detected in the sdss ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pie_color ] ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "its distance places it right at the edge of the @xmath147 sample ( see table  [ table : bins ] ) .",
    "its exclusion from this sample when limiting to the overlap range with the @xmath125 sample causes the decrease in clustering amplitude on large scales seen in the bottom - left panel .",
    "hence , this structure also causes the flattening in the projected correlation function of this sample at large separations seen in figure  [ fig : wp_vl ] .",
    "conversely , restricting the brighter @xmath153 sample to the smaller overlap range accentuates the supercluster s dominance and gives rise to the increased clustering seen in the top - right panel ( dashed line ) .",
    "taken together , these results strongly suggest that the most reliable estimate of @xmath0 for the @xmath147 luminosity bin comes from the sgw - excluded sample rather than the full sample .",
    "brighter , larger volume samples are much less affected by the sgw , while fainter samples do not extend as far and are thus not affected .",
    "these results are very similar to those of an identical test performed with the smaller samples of z05 .",
    "we have performed similar tests with the luminosity - threshold samples , and we find an analogous effect of the sgw , mostly for the @xmath148 sample and , to a lesser degree , for the @xmath149 sample .",
    "we have also done tests where we have excluded specifically the sgw region with angular and redshift cuts , confirming its significant impact on the large - scale clustering measurement for these samples .",
    "it is striking that even with the full sdss sample , the effect of the sgw is still significant , and one should use caution in interpreting clustering measurements for relatively large separations ( @xmath173 ) for the few specific samples whose redshift range extends just up to ( and including ) this structure . for this reason , in tables  [ table : bins ] and [ table : thres ] , we also provide power - law fits of these samples when restricted to a redshift limit that excludes the sgw ( @xmath150 , the same limiting redshift as for the @xmath125 and the @xmath174 samples ) .",
    "the hod parameters derived for these samples are relatively insensitive to the choice of sample volume , and the correlation functions corresponding to these hod models differ much less than the power - law fits ( see , e.g. , fig  15 in z05 ) .",
    "this insensitivity reflects the constrained nature of hod fits for a specified cosmological model : there is little freedom within these fits to adjust the large - scale correlation amplitude relative to the more robust measurements at @xmath175 , so the hod modeling just accepts the @xmath111 penalty of missing the large - scale data points .",
    "other large structures in the survey volume may affect the clustering measurements in more subtle ways .",
    "@xcite investigated the impact of such structures on the 3-point correlation function by analyzing the residuals of individual jackknife samples .",
    "the 2-point correlation function is much less sensitive to such effects , with individual deviations at the few percent level at most scales ( c.  k.  mcbride , private communication ) .",
    "of course , it is the cumulative impact of these residuals that determines the jackknife error bars , so the fact that they exist does not in itself imply that errors are larger than our estimates .",
    "the tests of z05 and @xcite suggest that jackknife error estimates for @xmath0 are typicallly accurate or conservative ( see  [ subsec : xi ] ) .",
    "an investigation of the individual residuals also suggests that the jackknife errors follow a gaussian distribution to a fair approximation , but with some noticeable skewness ( c.  k.  mcbride , private communication ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , we find only a small difference between measuring @xmath0 from the full data sample and taking the median of the jackknife @xmath0 values in each separation bin , which suggests that any non - gaussianity will have minimal impact on our clustering results .",
    "additional cosmic variance concerns have to do with the relatively small volumes associated with the lowest luminosity samples we consider .",
    "figure  [ fig : wp_vl_z ] can shed some light on this issue as well . specifically , the bottom - right panel checks the sensitivity to the volume probed in the correlation functions measured for the @xmath176 and @xmath125 luminosity bins .",
    "the general agreement of the curves ( calculated in the overlap volume ) to the respective sets of points ( calculated for the full volume - limited sample ) , within the measured uncertainties , is reassuring .",
    "we perform similar tests with the magnitude - threshold samples , looking at the robustness of the clustering measurements of different samples when limiting to the inner small volumes associated with the fainter thresholds . here",
    "we find substantial volume effects when considering the volume of the faintest threshold sample @xmath164 , but very weakened effects for the @xmath128 and brighter thresholds ( see figure  [ fig : wp_lvoid ] ) .",
    "we are unsure why the effects for the @xmath161 sample appear larger than those for the @xmath177 luminosity - bin sample , as they have the same outer redshift limit ; however , the galaxy populations are different in the two cases , with the luminosity threshold sample including also brighter galaxies .",
    "we find these finite - volume effects to be smaller than those found in the earlier samples of z05 , due to the larger sky coverage of sdss dr7 .",
    "the comparisons of solid and dashed curves in figure  [ fig : wp_vl_z ] provide the fairest test of luminosity dependence between the samples , as the effects of cosmic variance are essentially removed by matching volumes .",
    "for the fainter samples shown in the lower panels , the evidence for luminosity dependence is marginal relative to the error bars .",
    "the detection is stronger in the upper right panel and overwhelming for the brightest galaxies in the upper left .",
    "the difference between the dashed line and the open points in this panel is plausibly explained by the small sample ( @xmath178 galaxies ) of @xmath179 galaxies in the overlap volume : the larger volume of the full sample is required to give a robust measurement of large - scale clustering for these rare galaxies .",
    "these conclusions  evidence for increased clustering at @xmath180 and dramatically increased clustering at @xmath181  are consistent with the @xmath160 data points in figure  [ fig : bias_vl ] .",
    "to investigate further the implications of the luminosity - dependent clustering , we turn to hod modeling .",
    "we find the best - fit hod models for our set of volume - limited luminosity - threshold samples , using the five - parameter model described in   [ subsec : hod ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : hod_lum ] shows the hod best fits to the projected correlation functions ( staggered by 0.25 dex for clarity ) . here",

    "we also list @xmath182 , the fraction of sample galaxies that are satellites from the hod modeling results .",
    "we see that the hod models provide reasonable fits to the projected correlation functions , with deviations from a power - law more apparent for the brighter samples .",
    "the characteristic inflections in @xmath0 at @xmath183 arise at the transition from the small - scale , one - halo regime , where most correlated pairs come from galaxies in the same halo , to the large - scale , two - halo regime , where the shape of @xmath16 approximately traces the shape of the matter correlation function @xcite .",
    "the @xmath111 values for these fits are also specified in the table and can be compared to the corresponding values for the power - law fits ( table  [ table : thres ] ) . in all cases",
    "the hod model has a better goodness - of - fit than the best - fit power law model .",

    "( 2009 , appendix a ) , the greater departures from a power - law @xmath0 evident for brighter galaxies arise mainly because @xmath13 and @xmath100 are larger than the characteristic halo mass @xmath276 where the halo mass function begins to drop exponentially ; this change in the halo mass function shape leads to a sharper transition between the one - halo and two - halo regimes of the correlation function .    there is a considerable gap between the values of @xmath13 and @xmath100 at all luminosities . as in earlier works , we find an approximate scaling relation of @xmath277 , implying that a halo hosting two galaxies ( one central galaxy and one satellite ) above the luminosity threshold has to be about 17 times more massive on average than a halo hosting only one ( central ) galaxy above the luminosity threshold .",
    "halos in this `` hosting gap '' mass range tend to host more luminous ( higher mass ) central galaxies rather than multiple galaxies , consistent with the predictions of @xcite based on hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : m1_mmin]@xmath260 , this scaling factor is somewhat smaller at the high luminosity end , corresponding to massive halos that host rich groups or clusters .",

    "our results are consistent with previous measurements of these trends ( z05 ; @xcite ) .",

    "these assumptions allow us to use constraints from smaller scale clustering and the galaxy number density , greatly reducing the error bars on @xmath145 and reducing the sensitivity to cosmic variance in the large - scale clustering . given the significant finite - volume variations that remain even in sdss dr7 (  [ subsec : cosmicvariance ] ) , we consider these hod - based @xmath145 values to be our most robust estimates of the luminosity dependence of galaxy bias , despite their dependence on an assumed model .    to obtain hod - based bias factors for luminosity - bin samples , we have taken the central and satellite occupation functions for each bin to be simply the difference of the occupation functions for the bracketing threshold samples , yielding the open circles in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bias_vl ] .",

    "to the extent that halos have correlation coefficient @xmath294 with the matter distribution , the geometric mean result should hold throughout the two - halo regime , even if the halo bias is scale - dependent and the matter field is non - linear . on small scales , in the one - halo regime , the cross - correlation encodes information on the mixing of galaxy populations within the halos .",
    "any tendency of red or blue galaxies to segregate from one another will be reflected as a deviation of the cross - correlation function from the geometric mean .",
    "for example , if some halos contained only red galaxies while other halos contained only blue galaxies , this would depress the number of one - halo pairs and push the cross - correlation function below the geometric mean . however , the prediction of the cross - correlation function has a number of subtleties ; we discuss these issues and provide some simplified estimates in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we also show in this appendix that the cross - correlation function of two galaxy populations is mathematically determined if one knows the auto - correlation of the individual populations and of the combined population ; nonetheless , the cross - correlation presents this implicit information in a more intuitive form .",

    "note , however , that this is very far from suggesting a full segregation into `` red halos '' and `` blue halos '' .",
    "that extreme case would lead to no one - halo contribution at all , making the projected cross correlation approximately flat for @xmath175 .",
    "we find similar behavior for the cross - correlation of red and blue galaxies in all of our luminosity subsamples .",

    "@xcite find that the colors of satellite galaxies are correlated with those of their central galaxy .",
    "however , this trend , which they termed `` galactic conformity '' , is found to have roughly the same strength independent of luminosity , so its connection to our findings is unclear .",
    "it is known that the fraction of red galaxies that are satellites becomes larger with decreasing luminosity ( e.g. , z05 ; see also related discussions in the following subsections ) .",
    "thus , the luminosity - dependent suppression of the cross - correlation function in the one - halo regime may be simply related to the relative paucity of blue galaxies compared to red ones within large halos ( see also @xcite ) . in future work , we will model the cross - correlation results with hod in detail , and study the implication of these measurements for the distribution of red and blue galaxies within dark matter halos .",

    ". the amplitude of the satellite occupation function increases steadily going from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies .",
    "the lower - left panel plots the satellite fraction @xmath343 of each color bin against the median halo mass of galaxies in that bin .",
    "the satellite fraction rises from @xmath344 for the bluest bin to @xmath345 for the reddest bin , and the median halo mass increases as the fraction of galaxies that are satellites in massive halos grows .",
    "green - valley galaxies have occupation functions intermediate between the red and blue galaxies , consistent with the idea that they are a transitional population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    as discussed in  [ subsec : hodlum ] ,",
    "the trend of clustering strength with luminosity is explained principally by a rise in the central galaxy halo mass , and the satellite fraction drops with increasing luminosity because the halo mass function steepens at higher masses .",
    "in contrast , the trend with color at fixed luminosity can be explained with a constant halo mass for central galaxies and a steady increase of satellite fraction with redder color .",
    "the increase in typical host halo mass leads to an increase in the large - scale bias factor and thus a higher clustering amplitude at large scales .",
    "however , increasing @xmath343 drives the one - halo term up more rapidly than the bias factor , so the correlation function steepens for redder galaxies as well .",
    "the success of our simple hod model does not rule out a shift in central - galaxy halo mass for redder galaxies , but explaining the strong observed color trend solely through the central galaxy occupation would require placing moderate luminosity red galaxies at the centers of very massive halos , and it might well be impossible to match the clustering and number density constraints simultaneously .",
    "returning to the joint dependence on color and luminosity (  [ subsec : collum ] ) , figure  [ fig : hod_col_lum ] presents hod model fits to the blue and red galaxy populations for three of the luminosity bins shown in figure  [ fig : wp_col_lum ] .",
    "we use the same modeling approach adopted above for the fine color bins : we difference the central galaxy occupation functions of two luminosity - threshold samples to get the central galaxy occupation function of the luminosity bin , fix the satellite slope to @xmath346 , and vary only the relative central and satellite normalizations within each population to fit the red and blue @xmath0 measurements . with the other hod parameters fixed previously by fitting the correlation functions of the full luminosity - threshold samples ,",
    "this modeling has just one adjustable parameter within each luminosity bin .",
    "the model explains the rather complex color - luminosity trends from figure  [ fig : wp_col_lum ] fairly well .",
    "in particular , it is able to reproduce the small - scale clustering of red galaxies increasing towards low luminosities , both in absolute terms and relative to the large scale clustering , while the shape of @xmath0 for the blue galaxies stays roughly constant .",
    "the fraction of red galaxies that are satellites increases sharply with decreasing luminosity , from 33% to 60% to 90% in the three luminosity bins , while the fraction of blue satellites ( 13% , 19% , 19% ) is smaller and only weakly dependent on luminosity .",
    "the precise values of the satellite fractions depend on the hod parameterization used to fit @xmath0 , but the general trend is robust : most blue galaxies at these luminosities are central , and the satellite fraction for red galaxies is higher and increases towards faint luminosities .    the largest quantitative failure of this model is its overprediction of the large - scale @xmath0 for the faintest red galaxies ( and , to a smaller extent , for the faintest blue galaxies ) .",
    "it could be that our jackknife method underestimates the errors for this small - volume sample , and we have already noted ( figure  [ fig : hod_bin ] ) that our hod model overpredicts the total ( red+blue ) galaxy correlation function in this luminosity bin .",
    "however , this discrepancy could indicate a limitation of our restricted hod parameterization . to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we have considered models for the faint red galaxy population in which we vary the satellite slope @xmath98 , the concentration parameter of red galaxies in halos , and , most notably , the satellite cutoff parameter @xmath96 in equation  ( [ eq : hod ] ) .",
    "the dot - dashed curves in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : hod_col_lum ] show an example in which red satellites arise only in halos above @xmath347 , reducing the satellite fraction from 90% in our original fit to 34% , thereby lowering the large - scale bias factor .",
    "the physical motivation for such a model is that gas accretion ( and subsequent star formation ) by a satellite system might be shut off only if it enters a halo whose mass is much larger than the `` birth '' halo in which it was a central galaxy ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the lower satellite fraction of this model is more consistent with the results of @xcite , who argue , based on group catalogs , that 30 - 60% of faint red galaxies ( significantly fainter than those modeled here ) are central rather than satellite galaxies .",
    "the fit to the smallest scale data points is improved by increasing the galaxy concentration parameter @xcite to twice the dark matter value , steepening the profile of the one - halo term .",
    "visually , the @xmath0 prediction of this model is not much better than that of the original model , but the @xmath348 drops from 3.3 to 1.4 ( since the mid - range points where the deviation is largest are the most covariant ) , a large statistical improvement . despite its flexibility , this model underpredicts @xmath0 in the one - halo regime and overpredicts it in the two - halo regime , emphasizing how difficult it is to simultaneously reproduce the strong small - scale clustering and low large - scale bias factor of this galaxy sample .",
    "this tension could be a sign of environment - dependent effects on the hod , but the expected form of `` assembly bias '' for low mass halos , putting the redder central galaxies into older , more clustered halos , would exacerbate the discrepancies with the data further .",
    "overall , our inferences from hod modeling accord well with the theoretical predictions of @xcite , who compared the results of cosmological sph simulations to hogg et al.s ( @xcite ) measurements of galaxy environments as a function of luminosity and color .",
    "in particular , @xcite find that the environment of satellite galaxies in the simulations is strongly correlated with stellar population age ( hence color ) , and that for low and intermediate luminosities the environmental dependence of the overall galaxy population tracks that of satellite galaxies .",
    "@xcite also find that the great majority of faint red galaxies in the simulation are satellites , though the simulation they use to study this population is small .",
    "the success of our simple hod models in reproducing the observed color dependence of @xmath0 contrasts with the recent conclusions of @xcite , who find that some segregation of early- and late - type galaxies into separate halos is required to reproduce their measured angular clustering of an sdss photometric galaxy sample , which extends to smaller separations .",
    "the sdss galaxy redshift survey allows high - precision clustering measurements for a broadly selected galaxy sample with extensive , high quality photometric information .",
    "we have examined the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy correlation function in the dr7 main galaxy sample , which includes approximately @xmath36 galaxies over @xmath2 deg@xmath3 , with a median redshift of @xmath349 .",
    "this is the largest sample used to date for such studies , by a factor of several .",
    "furthermore , the dr7 main galaxy sample is likely to remain the definitive low redshift galaxy survey for many years ; other ongoing and planned surveys , including the boss survey of lrgs in sdss - iii @xcite , will probe larger volumes and higher redshifts , but they will not target a wide range of galaxy types in the present - day universe .",
    "our analysis focuses on the projected auto - correlation functions calculated for volume - limited samples defined by luminosity and color cuts , with measurements tabulated in appendix  [ sec : measurements ] .",
    "we use hod modeling to interpret these measurements in terms of the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos , assuming a @xmath5cdm cosmological model with @xmath350 , @xmath86 , @xmath351 , @xmath90 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath0 increases with increasing galaxy luminosity , slowly for @xmath6 and rapidly for @xmath352 , where @xmath15 corresponds to @xmath155 ( @xcite ; we quote absolute magnitudes for @xmath42 throughout the paper ) . for @xmath154 , @xmath0",
    "is reasonably described by a power - law at @xmath353 , while brighter samples show clear and increasingly strong inflections at @xmath354 .",

    "we find @xmath356 , similar to the luminosity dependence found by @xcite for @xmath170-selected galaxies in the 2dfgrs .",
    "at fixed luminosity , the redshift - space correlation function of red galaxies exhibits stronger `` finger - of - god '' distortions than that of blue galaxies , while the blue galaxies exhibit stronger large - scale , coherent flow distortions .",
    "the projected correlation function of red galaxies is steeper and higher in amplitude .",
    "the cross - correlation of red and blue galaxies is equal to the geometric mean of the auto - correlation functions on large scales , but it falls slightly below the geometric mean for @xmath357 . adopting fine color bins , we find a continuous trend of clustering with color : the bluest galaxies have a shallow , low - amplitude correlation function , the clustering of `` green valley '' galaxies is intermediate between that of blue and red galaxies , and the reddest galaxies have a ( slightly ) steeper correlation function than galaxies that trace the ridge of the red sequence .",
    "we present detailed results for the @xmath125 luminosity bin , but we find similar trends in other bins where our statistics are good enough to measure them .",
    "the luminosity dependence of clustering for the red and blue populations is strikingly different . for blue galaxies ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath0 increases slowly but steadily with luminosity over the range @xmath358 to @xmath152 , with nearly constant shape . for red galaxies ,",
    "there are only weak luminosity trends over the range @xmath359 .",
    "the @xmath360 galaxies have a much higher correlation amplitude and a strong break in @xmath0 at @xmath361 .",
    "most remarkably , the small - scale ( @xmath175 ) correlation function of the @xmath176 red galaxies is equal to that of the @xmath360 red galaxies , a factor of @xmath362 higher than that of intermediate luminosity red galaxies .",
    "red galaxies with @xmath363 show even stronger small - scale clustering , though our survey volume for such low luminosity systems is small .",
    "our hod modeling shows that these varied trends in the amplitude and shape of @xmath0 can , for the most part , be well explained by the combination of @xmath5cdm cosmology and physically plausible recipes for the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos .",
    "the luminosity dependence of @xmath0 arises from an overall shift in the mass scale of the mean occupation function @xmath83 .",
    "the halo mass @xmath94 for hosting central galaxies of luminosity @xmath8 rises with luminosity .",
    "correspondingly , the central galaxy luminosity increases with halo mass as @xmath364 , where @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and @xmath13 is the halo mass at which the median luminosity of central galaxies is @xmath8 .",
    "the mass @xmath100 at which halos host an average of one satellite above luminosity @xmath8 follows a similar trend : we find @xmath365 over most of our luminosity range , with a smaller factor at the highest luminosities .",
    "we find substantial scatter ( @xmath366 dex ) between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity for @xmath352 , while fits for lower luminosities are consistent with little or no scatter .",
    "the color dependence of @xmath0 at fixed luminosity can be explained well by a change in the relative fractions of central and satellite galaxies . in our best - fit models of the @xmath125 bin , for example",
    ", the satellite fraction rises steadily from 15% for the bluest galaxies to 75% for the reddest galaxies . increasing the satellite fraction increases the large - scale bias factor by placing more galaxies in high mass halos , and it produces a steeper correlation function with a stronger inflection by boosting the one - halo term relative to the two - halo term . a modest offset in the halo mass scale for _",
    "central _ red and blue galaxies is physically plausible , but our models are able to fit the main observed trends without such offsets , and it is unlikely that the central - galaxy mass scale can be the primary driver of the observed color trends in @xmath0 .    differences in satellite fractions largely explain the different luminosity dependence of @xmath0 for red and blue galaxies .",
    "however , within our standard parameterization we are unable to find a statistically acceptable fit to the clustering of the red @xmath282 galaxies . after adjusting the model to allow red satellites only in relatively high mass halos ( @xmath367 , a factor of 100 above @xmath13 ) , we do find a statistically acceptable fit , but even this model underpredicts the one - halo term of @xmath0 while overpredicting the two - halo term .",
    "the difficulty in reproducing @xmath0 for faint red galaxies could signify a breakdown of our assumption that the hod is independent of large - scale environment , but the obvious forms of environment dependence ( redder central galaxies in older halos ) go in the wrong direction .",
    "clearly the clustering of the faint red galaxy population merits further study . while we do not know of any planned redshift surveys that will provide better statistics for such low luminosity galaxies ,",
    "cross - correlation of photometric samples with redshift samples of more luminous galaxies may allow higher precision clustering measurements from a larger effective volume .",
    "our measured luminosity and color trends agree with those found in earlier studies , most notably the @xcite studies of the 2dfgrs and the z05 study of sdss dr2 , but the sdss dr7 sample allows measurements of higher precision , greater detail , and wider dynamic range .",
    "our conclusions about the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy halo occupations are generally consistent with those found in earlier studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; z05 ) , although the greater precision and dynamic range of our clustering measurements allows us to examine this dependence in substantially greater detail .",
    "even with sdss dr7 , the tests in  [ subsec : cosmicvariance ] reveal significant finite - volume effects for samples with limiting absolute magnitude @xmath368 , which extend just far enough to enclose the sloan great wall , and for samples with limiting magnitude @xmath369 , which have small total volume .",
    "these effects have a significant influence on the @xmath370 values of power - law fits to these samples ( and their color - defined subsamples ) .",
    "they have little impact on the best - fit values of hod parameters , though they do affect the @xmath111 values of hod fits .",
    "the finite - volume uncertainties limit the strength of our conclusions about the faint red galaxy population .",
    "our modeling in this paper derives hod parameters for well - specified classes of galaxies defined by thresholds or bins in luminosity and divisions in color .",
    "the related formalism of conditional luminosity functions @xcite seeks to provide a continuous description of the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on halo mass . in a subsequent paper ( zheng et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we will present a generalization of this approach to luminosity - color distributions and apply it to our @xmath0 data , resulting in a comprehensive model that synthesizes the information from all of the measurements presented here .",
    "our hod parameterization is flexible enough to describe the predictions of galaxy formation models accurately @xcite , and with an assumed cosmological model the @xmath0 measurements are themselves sufficient to provide tight constraints on hod parameters .",
    "studies of other real - space clustering measures , such as the multiplicity function of groups , the three - point correlation function , the topology of isodensity surfaces , and the void probability function can test the hod models presented here , perhaps revealing breakdowns of this parameterization that would point to new aspects of galaxy formation physics .",
    "most interesting would be to find evidence for environmental variations of the hod , as this would tie observable galaxy properties to features of halo formation history that correlate with large - scale environment at fixed halo mass .",
    "conversely , limits on environmental variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) limit the degree to which galaxy properties can be driven by quantities such as halo formation time or concentration .    uncertainties in cosmological parameters within the range allowed by other data have little impact on our conclusions . the largest effect is that changes to @xmath21 or @xmath22 would shift the mass scale of the hod @xcite .",
    "the combination of @xmath0 constraints with dynamical measures that are sensitive to the halo mass scale allows novel constraints on these cosmological parameters .",
    "efforts in this direction are underway , using cluster mass - to - light ratios , galaxy - galaxy lensing , and redshift - space distortions .",
    "we expect these analyses , together with the cluster abundance analysis of @xcite , to yield tight independent constraints on @xmath22 and @xmath21 with several systematic cross - checks .",
    "these constraints , based on the inferred amplitude of dark matter clustering , are complementary to those derived from the large - scale _ shape _ of the galaxy power spectrum @xcite , which can themselves be sharpened by using hod modeling to account for the effects of scale - dependent galaxy bias @xcite .",
    "the combination of these constraints with those derived from cmb data , type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , and other cosmological observables will allow stringent consistency tests of the @xmath5cdm cosmological model , at the few - percent level .",
    "surveys of the next decade will extend many of these techniques to higher redshifts , but the sdss maps of structure in the present - day universe still have much to teach us about galaxy formation and the physics of the cosmos .",

    "@xcite consider the general case of the relation between the two - point auto - correlation functions of a galaxy sample and the auto- and cross - correlation functions of its subsamples ( see their appendix ) .",
    "here we focus on the specific case of the correlation functions of red , blue and all galaxies .",
    "the point we make here is that only three of the four correlation functions ( blue - blue , red - red , all - all auto - correlation functions , and red - blue cross - correlation functions ) are independent .",
    "that is , if we measured blue - blue , red - red , and all - all auto - correlation functions , there would be no new information from the red - blue cross - correlation functions .    to demonstrate that this is the case",
    ", we recall that the two - point correlation function represents a galaxy pair count .",
    "the total number of pairs of all galaxies in the parent sample is simply the sum of the numbers of red galaxy pairs , blue galaxy pairs , and red - blue galaxy pairs .",
    "that is , @xmath371 where @xmath372 , @xmath373 , and @xmath374 are the mean number density of the parent sample and the red / blue subsamples , @xmath375 , @xmath376 , and @xmath377 are the two - point auto - correlation functions , and @xmath378 is the red - blue two - point cross - correlation function .",
    "the factor of @xmath379 in front of the auto - correlation terms is to avoid the double count of auto - pairs . since @xmath380 ,",
    "the above identity reduces to @xmath381 the same relation holds for projected correlation functions @xmath69 .",
    "thus the red - blue cross - correlation function can be derived from the three auto - correlation functions .    as a test of this relation",
    ", we predicted the red - blue cross - correlation function based on the measured all - all , red - red , and blue - blue auto - correlation functions for the @xmath125 volume - limited galaxy sample .",
    "the prediction agrees essentially perfectly with the measured cross - correlation function shown in figure  [ fig : cross_corr ] , with deviations much smaller than the @xmath382 error bars .",
    "there is thus , in theory , no new information provided by the cross - correlation function , when one has measured the three individual auto - correlation functions . in practice ,",
    "the relation in equation  ( [ eq : cross ] ) and that for projected two - point correlation functions can be used for a consistency check .",
    "furthermore , for understanding the mixture among different galaxy populations , the cross - correlation function is more readily interpreted than the consistency relation itself .",
    "for example , segregation of `` red '' and `` blue '' halos would produce a distinctive suppression of the one - halo term of the cross - correlation function , while its effect on the auto - correlation functions ( boosting the red and blue auto - correlations relative to the all auto - correlation ) might be difficult to disentangle from changes in satellite occupation slopes , concentration parameters , and so forth .",
    "the two - point cross - correlation function of two populations ( e.g. , red and blue galaxies we study here ) is often compared to the geometric mean of the two - point auto - correlation functions to infer the information about the mixing of the the two populations . on large scales , where the two - halo term dominates the correlation functions , the cross - correlation function",
    "is guaranteed to be the geometric mean of the auto - correlation functions . on small scales , where the one - halo term dominates , it is not obvious what we can infer if there are deviations of the cross - correlation function from the geometric mean .",
    "we show here that the situation becomes even less clear for projected correlation functions .    as an example , consider the two - point auto - correlation functions of red and blue galaxies , @xmath377 and @xmath376 , and their cross - correlation function @xmath378 . under the assumption that these correlation functions are positive",
    ", we have @xmath383 from the cauchy - schwartz inequality .",
    "even if we had @xmath384 on all scales , the above inequality would mean that the projected correlation functions satisfy @xmath385 the equality only holds for the case where both galaxy populations trace the same dark matter distribution and @xmath377 and @xmath376 are parallel to each other , which is true on large scales but not on small scales .",
    "measuring projected correlation functions from galaxy redshift data involves a set of standard procedures .",
    "we test here the sensitivity of our measurements to some key details of these procedures ( described in   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : system ] presents projected correlation functions for several variants of our standard technique , calculated for the @xmath139 sample , which yields the smallest statistical errors among our samples .",

    "the measurements presented in the paper all use the @xcite estimator , the standard for such studies , and we show here ( left - hand side ) results when using also the estimators of @xcite ( long - dashed red line ) and @xcite ( short - dashed blue line ) .",
    "we find that the alternative estimators provide similar measurements to the landy - szalay one , with some differences on small scales for the hamilton estimator and a significant deviation of the davis - peebles measurement on large scales .",
    "our results are in accord with long - standing claims that the davis - peebles estimator is more sensitive to uncertainties in the galaxy mean density , with the differences becoming apparent on large scales @xcite , and that the landy - szalay estimator has improved shot - noise behavior @xcite .",
    "a detailed examination of different clustering estimators is given by @xcite .",
    "the angular selection function is carefully calculated in each sector on the sky , with an average completeness of 0.97 .",
    "the detailed angular completeness is mimicked in the random samples , and is then used to weight both real and random galaxies .",

    "a more conservative cut of @xmath387 ( which eliminates @xmath388 additional galaxies ; dot - dashed green line in the left - hand side ) results in negligible changes to the measurements .",
    "if we drop the weighting of both real and random galaxies by the angular completeness , it also makes no difference to the results .",
    "however , neglecting to address the angular incompleteness altogether ( i.e. , by not including it in the random catalog and not weighting either data or randoms by it ; dotted magenta line ) results in a couple of percent difference .",
    "we test additional variants of our standard procedures in the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : system ] .",
    "the dashed blue curve shows the effect of integrating @xmath0 up to @xmath389 instead of @xmath390 .",
    "replacing the random catalog with another realization of equal size makes negligible difference except at the smallest separations ; the slight changes in the innermost bins show the importance of using a sufficiently large random catalog .",
    "changing the assumed @xmath21 from 0.3 to 0.25 when calculating comoving separations produces a small ( @xmath391 ) systematic shift of the measurements . finally , relaxing the bright flux limit of 14.5 , needed for defining the luminosity - threshold samples , might introduce occasional problems with galaxy deblending or saturation nearby ( @xmath392 ) , but increasing the minimum redshift from 0.02 to 0.05 results in negligible differences .",

    "<S> we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the largest - ever galaxy redshift survey , the main galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) seventh data release ( dr7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the projected correlation function @xmath0 of volume - limited samples , extracted from the parent sample of @xmath1 galaxies over @xmath2 deg@xmath3 , extending up to redshift of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modeling assuming a @xmath5cdm cosmology ( inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of @xmath0 grows slowly with luminosity for @xmath6 and increases sharply at higher luminosities , with a large - scale bias factor @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the sample luminosity threshold . at fixed luminosity , </S>",
    "<S> redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function , a steady trend that runs through the `` blue cloud '' and `` green valley '' and continues across the `` red sequence . '' </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation of red and blue galaxies is close to the geometric mean of their auto - correlations , dropping slightly below at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations separately are strikingly different . </S>",
    "<S> blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of clustering strength with luminosity , with nearly constant shape of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the large - scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at @xmath10 , but the lowest luminosity red galaxies ( @xmath11 ) show very strong clustering on small scales ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the @xmath5cdm+hod framework . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of @xmath0 for higher luminosity galaxies reflects an overall shift in the mass scale of their host dark matter halos , in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass at which a halo has , on average , one satellite galaxy brighter than @xmath8 is @xmath14 over most of the luminosity range , with a smaller ratio above @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the growth and steepening of @xmath0 for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high mass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos , a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> our extensive measurements , provided in tabular form , will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy formation , a firm grounding of semi - empirical models of the galaxy population , and new constraints on cosmological parameters from combining real - space galaxy clustering with mass - sensitive statistics such as redshift - space distortions , cluster mass - to - light ratios , and galaxy - galaxy lensing . </S>"
