    "cp violation is generally divided into three types : cp violation in mixing ( indirect ) , cp violation in decay ( direct ) , and cp violation in the interference between decay and mixing ( indirect or direct ) . in all cases ,",
    "cp violation occurs when the decay rate of a particle differs from that of its cp conjugate .",
    "this requires contributions from two different cp violating terms with different phases .",
    "in addition , two cp conserving terms must also have different phases .",
    "the cp conserving phase shift is usually generated by qcd final state interactions . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "two cp violating terms often come from tree level and penguin decays .",
    "extensions to the standard model can introduce other cp violating terms which can interfere with the sm weak decays to generate cp violation .    in charm , mixing is very suppressed so at current experimental sensitivities , cp violation searches are generally searching for direct cp violation .",
    "one measures the cp violation rate by looking at the asymmetry : @xmath0 in the fixed - target experiments e791 and focus , the production mechanism gives rise to different numbers of produced particles and antiparticles .",
    "therefore , these experiments normalize to another ( copious ) decay mode which is unlikely to exhibit cp violation .",
    "the most precise charm cp violation results come from the fermilab fixed - target experiments e791 and focus and the @xmath1 central detector , cleo .",
    "e791 ( focus ) took data at fermilab during the fixed - target running of 19912 ( 19967 ) .",
    "these experiments , like all modern fixed - target charm experiments are quite similar .",
    "both sport silicon strip detectors in the vertex region to separate the charm production and decay vertices , a key requirement in separating signal from background . following the silicon detectors are wire chambers and magnets which track and momentum analyze the decay products .",
    "particle identification of charged hadrons is accomplished by the use of 2 ( e791 ) or 3 ( focus ) multi - cell threshold erenkov counters .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters identify electrons and photons while scintillation counters downstream of absorbing steel walls are used to identify muons .",
    "both experiments used a hadron calorimeter to trigger on interesting events with high efficiency .",
    "the targets in both experiments were segmented to allow charm decays in air .",
    "e791 used a 500  gev/@xmath2 @xmath3 beam while focus used a photon beam with an average energy of 180 gev ( for events with a reconstructed charm particle ) .",
    "the average charm momentum was around 60  gev/@xmath2 for both experiments . from a collection of 20 billion ( 6 billion ) triggered events ,",
    "e791 ( focus ) fully reconstructed more than 200,000 ( 1,000,000 ) charm particles .",
    "the cleo experiment utilizes the cesr storage ring at cornell which is a symmetric @xmath1 collider .",
    "the cleo results presented here come from data taken at and near the @xmath4 , mostly from cleo ii.v ( 19969 ) . both cleo ii@xcite and cleo ii.v@xcite detectors use wire chambers for particle tracking and an excellent electromagnetic csi calorimeter providing good reconstruction of photons , electron , and @xmath5 s .",
    "these detectors are inside a 1.5  t axial magnetic field and surrounded by muon chambers . in cleo",
    "ii.v a silicon strip system near the beam was also present .",
    "the data presented here utilize 4.713.7  pb@xmath6 of luminosity .",
    "charm particles produced at cleo generally have a momentum of a few gev/@xmath2 .",
    "e791@xcite , focus@xcite , and cleo@xcite have all looked for cp violating behavior in the cabibbo suppressed decays @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these measurements , shown in fig .  [ fig : cpviol_d0 ] and tabulated in table  [ tab : cpviol_d0 ] are approaching the 1% level where non - standard model effects might show up .",
    "[ fig : cpviol_d0 ] _ , width=451,height=288 ]    0.1 in    ._measurements of the cp asymmetry from @xmath9 decays . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : cpviol_dp_ks ]      searching for direct cp violation in three - body decays is significantly more complicated than two - body decays .",
    "one can look for cp violation by integrating over phase space , by looking at quasi two - body decays by cutting on resonances , or by using a full dalitz plot analysis of the charm and anticharm particle to look for discrepancies .",
    "focus@xcite and e791@xcite have both reported results for @xmath10 .",
    "focus reported @xmath11 and plans to perform a cp violation dalitz plot analysis in the future .",
    "e791 also reported results for the sub - resonances : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "as a byproduct of their dalitz plot analysis of @xmath14@xcite , cleo measured @xmath15 again consistent with zero .",
    "it is common knowledge that point particle lorentz invariant field theories require cpt invariance@xcite .",
    "however , some standard model extensions need not be lorentz - invariant@xcite .",
    "in fact , it might be possible to find evidence for strings which dominate at the plank scale using data which exists today .",
    "limits on cpt violation have been set using neutral @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons ( mixing interferometry ) .",
    "it is possible , however , for these effects to manifest at different levels in different flavors so a check in the charm system is also important .",
    "this analysis mostly follows the notation of ref .",
    "first , the standard effective hamiltonian is rewritten : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are complex and @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is the cpt violating term .",
    "the time - dependent right - sign @xmath24 decay probability is given by : @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time - dependent @xmath26 decay probability @xmath27 is simply @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 . from this , one can form an asymmetry for right - sign decays as : @xmath31 by taylor expanding @xmath32 to 1st order and switching to the standard mixing variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 , one finds : @xmath35 \\gamma t\\ ] ] given the measured limits on mixing and the lifetime range probed by the focus experiment , this approximation is sufficiently accurate . experimentally : @xmath36 therefore , measuring the slope of the lifetime ratio distribution immediately returns @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpt_mass ] shows the invariant mass distribution for right - sign @xmath38 decays .",
    "these decays have been tagged using the charge of the soft pion from @xmath39 decays .     for events which have a @xmath40 tag .",
    "[ fig : cpt_mass ] _ , width=451,height=264 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt_fit ] , the ratio of @xmath41 to @xmath42 as a function of reduced proper time , @xmath43 , is plotted .",
    "the reduced proper time is defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the distance between the production and decay vertex , @xmath46 is the calculated resolution on @xmath45 , and @xmath47 is the minimum detachment cut applied .",
    "this has the effect of starting the clock at the moment at which the particle could first be reconstructed by the experiment ( with the given detachment cut ) and thus greatly reducing the amount of correction needed due to acceptance .",
    "the fit to fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt_fit ] is the basis of the preliminary focus result : @xmath48 the actual limit on the cpt violating parameter depends on mixing parameters ; for example if @xmath49 and @xmath50 then @xmath51 .",
    "the systematic errors were determined by exploring the effect of different absorption lengths in the monte carlo simulation , different selection criteria , and different sideband selections for the background subtraction .",
    "to @xmath42 as a function of reduced proper time , @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig : cpt_fit ] _ , width=451,height=288 ]",
    "considerable progress is currently being made by focus and cleo in the search for direct cp violation in the charm system .",
    "current limits are approaching the 1% level at which non - standard model effects might be seen . in the near future ,",
    "babar and belle should be able to probe even further in this exciting area . following this",
    ", btev will also have an opportunity to search for cp violation in the charm sector with a sample of more than 1 billion reconstructed charm decays .",
    "in addition , the search for cpt violation is also being extended into the charm sector .",
    "both types of searches have the potential to uncover exciting new physics .",
