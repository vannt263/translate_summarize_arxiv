    "since 1998 , the type ia supernova ( sne ia ) observations @xcite have shown that our universe has entered into a phase of accelerating expansion . during these years from that time , many additional observational results , including current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurement from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)@xcite , and the data of the large scale structure ( lss ) from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , also strongly support this suggestion .",
    "these observational results have greatly inspirited theorists to understand the mechanism of the accelerating expansion of the universe , which is usually attributed to an exotic energy component with negative pressure , dubbed dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the simplest but most natural candidate of de is the cosmological constant @xmath17 , with the constant equation of state ( eos ) @xmath18 .",
    "as we know , the cosmic concordance model confronts with two difficulties : the fine - tuning problem and the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "both of these problems are related to the de density . in order to solve or alleviate cosmological constant puzzles ,",
    "many dynamical de models are proposed , where the de density and its eos are time - varying .",
    "however , the predictions of the cosmological constant model still fit to the current observations @xcite .",
    "therefore the dynamical de models being proposed should not be far away from the cosmological constant model , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , ghost condensate @xcite , holographic de @xcite and agegraphic de @xcite etc .",
    "although many de models have been presented , the nature of de is still a conundrum .",
    "this puzzle can not be understood before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established .",
    "but the two additional aspects from the current cosmological observations and some basic quantum gravitational principles may shed light on probing the nature of de .",
    "on the one hand , provided that we know little on the theoretical nature of de at present , the combined cosmic observations can play an important role in understanding the nature of de .",
    "the cosmological parameters space in the de model can be determined by the constraints of the data combinations .",
    "recently , the 397 sn ia data was compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite by adding cfa3 sample from the cfa sn group to the union set by ref .",
    "@xcite , which include 250 sn ia at high redshift but only 57 at low redshift , to form the constitution set .",
    "aside from the sn ia data , the combined analysis is required in order to break the degeneracy between the cosmological parameters , which includes cosmic observations from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , cmb and the observational hubble data ( ohd ) .",
    "the bao are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dfgrs and sdss main galaxy samples or the sdss luminous red galaxies and measure the distance - redshift relation . from these samples ,",
    "the values of @xmath19 $ ] and their inverse covariance matrix in the measurement of bao can be obtained @xcite . for the measurement of cmb",
    ", we utilize the shift parameter @xmath20 at the photon decoupling epoch @xmath21 , the acoustic scale @xmath22 , and together with the physical baryon density parameter multiplied by 100 , thus it is @xmath23 @xcite . here , it is worth noting that the wmap distance information @xmath24 and @xmath22 can not be measured by wmap directly , but are derived from making a global fitting constraint with mcmc method by using the full wmap data on the assumption that a certain cosmological model has been given in advance @xcite .",
    "although in theory the inverse covariance matrix on @xmath24 and @xmath22 is model dependent , it is feasible to use the derived results about @xmath24 and @xmath22 to constrain the parameters in another de model since @xmath24 and @xmath22 do not depend strongly on the de model which is not far away from the cosmological constant model @xcite .",
    "what is more , the paper @xcite has been demonstrated that @xmath25 $ ] effectively provide a good summary of cmb data when the de model parameters are constrained .",
    "in addition , we employ the ohd at twelve different redshifts determined by using the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the value of the hubble constant is replaced by @xmath26 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and add the three more observational data @xmath27 and @xmath28 in @xcite . since the constraint results of a given model are dependent on the combined data @xcite , in this paper we use a fully combined observations from the 397 sn ia standard candle data , the value of @xmath29 $ ] and their inverse covariance matrix in the measurement of bao , the values of @xmath25 $ ] and their inverse covariance matrix in the measurement of cmb , and the fifteen ohd .",
    "on the other hand , the models which are constructed in light of some fundamental principle are more charming , since this kind of de model may exhibit some underlying features of de , for instance the holographic de model @xcite and the agegraphic de model @xcite .",
    "the holographic de model is built on the basis of holographic principle and some features of quantum gravity theory .",
    "the agegraphic de model is derived from taking the combination between the uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics and general relativity into account . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the holographic de model , which is considered as a dynamic vacuum energy .",
    "according to the holographic principle , the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and is related to the area of its boundary . by applying the principle to cosmology , one can obtain the upper bound of the entropy contained in the universe . for a system with size @xmath30 and uv cut - off @xmath17 without decaying into a black hole , it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath30 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus @xmath31 .",
    "the largest @xmath30 allowed is the one saturating this inequality , thus we obtain the holographic de density @xmath32 where c is a numerical constant and @xmath33 is the reduced planck mass @xmath34 .",
    "it just means a duality between uv cut - off and ir cut - off .",
    "the uv cut - off is related to the vacuum energy , and ir cut - off is related to the large scale of the universe , for example hubble horizon , particle horizon , event horizon , ricci scalar or the generalized functions of dimensionless variables as discussed by @xcite .",
    "next , we give a brief review on the main results when hubble horizon , particle horizon , event horizon or ricci scalar are taken as the ir cut - off , respectively .",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , it is found that the holographic de density is in proportion to @xmath37 , the same as dark matter density , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "it appears that it is natural to solve the coincidence problem .",
    "however , hsu @xcite pointed out that the dark energy eos @xmath39 was obtained in this instance .",
    "it is obvious that this result is not consistent with the current observations .",
    "this bad situation can be changed by considering the holographic de with hubble horizon as the time variable cosmological constant .",
    "more detailed analysis is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath35 @xmath40 .",
    "as shown in paper @xcite , li pointed out that this yields the dark energy eos is not less than @xmath41 .",
    "thus the current accelerated expansion of our universe can not be well explained .",
    "however , this result in @xcite is obtained on the assumption that de dominates .",
    "the holographic de model with particle horizon has been discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 @xmath42 . the holographic de model with event horizon",
    "can reveal the dynamic nature of the vacuum energy and provide a desired eos of the holographic de with the model parameter @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , the holographic de behaves like quintessence , cosmological constant and phantom respectively for the different values of the model parameter : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the value of model parameter @xmath43 plays a crucial role in determining the property of holographic de in this case . however , this model is confronted with the causality problem : why should the present density of de be determined by the future event horizon of the universe .    @xmath35 @xmath47 . in @xcite , it has shown that this model can avoid the causality problem and naturally solve the coincidence problem of dark energy after ricci scalar is taken as the ir cut - off and the parameters have been well constrained by the combined astronomical observations @xcite .    subsequently , in @xcite , granda and oliveros generalized the form of the ir cut - off on the basis of the ricci scalar : @xmath48 where there are two independent model parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which can be determined by using the combined constraints of the thorough observational datasets . in this paper , we consider the holographic de model with new ir cut - off in both flat and non - flat case .",
    "the performance of a global fitting will be made by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method . in this way",
    ", we can work in the framework of multi - parameter freedoms , including the basic cosmological parameters ( @xmath51 ) and the new - added model parameters ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section ,",
    "we briefly review the holographic de model with new ir cut - off . in section iii",
    ", we perform the cosmic observation constraint on the holographic de model .",
    "the last section is the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review on the general formula in the holographic de model with new ir cut - off . with a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the einstein field equation can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the hubble function , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the energy density and the pressure of a general piece of matter , and their subscripts @xmath58 denote @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which respectively correspond to matter component , the holographic de with new infrared cut - off and the curvature part of space . here",
    "the matter component includes the cold dark matter and the baryon matter , i.e. @xmath62 the parameter @xmath63 denote the closed , flat and open geometries , respectively . the effective energy density and the effective pressure of the curvature part are @xmath64    as suggested by granda and oliveros in paper @xcite , the energy density of the holographic de with new ir cut - off is given as @xmath65 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the dimensionless parameters in holographic de model with new ir cut - off , which are regarded as independent of each other . in this paper ,",
    "a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath66 . after changing the variable from the cosmic time @xmath66 to @xmath67",
    ", we can rewritten the eq .",
    "( 4 ) as @xmath68 with the help of the definitions as follows : @xmath69 the eq .",
    "( 10 ) can be ulteriorly rewritten as @xmath70 solving this first order differential equation about @xmath71 , we can obtain @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the integral constant and can be derived from the initial condition @xmath74 , which is @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the dimensionless energy density of the holographic de with new ir cut - off : @xmath77 then , combining the above definition of the dimensionless energy density of the holographic de with its conservation equation , we can obtain the eos of the holographic de with new ir cut - off @xmath78 in addition , we shall investigate the evolution of the deceleration parameter .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) with the definition of the deceleration parameter , we can get @xmath79 where we have utilized the definitions of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . according to the energy conservation equation , we have @xmath82    in the review above , it is direct and natural to consider the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 when we solve the differential eq .",
    "next , we discuss three special cases when the denominators in eq .",
    "( 13 ) equal zero as follows :    * case 1 : * @xmath85 and @xmath86    in this case , we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath88 . now the energy density of the holographic de is @xmath89 .",
    "compared to the friedmann equation , it is found that the de density is not consistent with the current observations of @xmath90 exotic component in the universe .",
    "* case 2 : * @xmath91 and @xmath86    from the latter equation , we can get @xmath92 .",
    "then the energy density of the holographic de is @xmath93 . in this case , the solution of the first order differential equation is @xmath94 where we have set the integral constant @xmath95 and defined @xmath96 as the dimensionless energy density of the holographic de . considering the current value of the dimensionless de density ,",
    "we can obtain the value of the only model parameter @xmath97 .",
    "so the case is a viable de model .",
    "* case 3 : * @xmath85 and @xmath98    from the former equation , we can obtain @xmath99 .",
