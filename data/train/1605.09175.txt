    "magnetic flux tubes with vortex filaments at their core were discovered by abrikosov in the ginzburg - landau theory of type ii superconductivity @xcite . in that context",
    "these extended string like objects are macroscopic and do not require an specific treatment in a quantum framework .",
    "nielsen and olesen , however , rediscovered identical extended objects in the relativistic abelian higgs model , see @xcite , and proposed for them to play a r@xmath0le in hadronic physics as dual strings .",
    "it is thus clear after the nielsen - olesen proposal that in this new framework the vortex filaments are of quantum nature and there is the need of clarifying to what kind of quantum state they correspond .",
    "it was later shown by bogomolnyi @xcite that abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortices , seen in a two dimensional space , belong to a special class of topological solitons when the masses of the scalar and vector particles in the ahm are equal , or , the correlation lengths of scalar and magnetic fields correspond to the critical point between type i and type ii phases in ginzburg - landau superconductors .",
    "it is thus natural to try the understanding of quantum bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield planar vortices within the general quantum theory of solitons .",
    "the first successful attempts in this direction were achieved by vassilevich in @xcite , and rebhan et al . in @xcite , by attacking this problem in the @xmath1 supersymmetric ahm .",
    "almost simultaneously bordag and drozdov in @xcite computed the vacuum energy due to purely fermionic fluctuations on a nielsen - olesen vortex .",
    "together with other colleague we performed similar calculations in the purely bosonic planar ahm in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used the spectral heat kernel / zeta function regularization procedure to control the divergences , both ultraviolet and infrared , arising in the computation of vacuum energies caused by one - loop fluctuations of bps vortices , as well as those associated to tadpole and self - energy graphs .",
    "invented by hawking @xcite and dowker et al @xcite to describe quantum fields in curved space - times this method was used for the first time in the analysis of quantum fluctuations of kinks and solitons by van nieuwenhuizen et al in @xcite within a @xmath1 supersymmetric framework .",
    "we took profit of these ideas to calculate the quantum corrections to the masses of several types of topological kinks in scalar field models with different number of fields in references @xcite .",
    "the vortex casimir energy is the main ingredient in the formula giving the vortex mass ( 2d ) or string tension ( 3d ) quantum corrections .",
    "it is formally given by the trace , both in the matrix and the @xmath2-functional sense , of the square root of the matrix elliptic partial differential operator that governs the one - loop vortex fluctuation .",
    "this hessian operator is a matrix second - order partial differential operator ( pdo ) of schr@xmath3dinger type .",
    "its square root is defined in the framework of complex powers of elliptic ( pseudo ) differential operators , a well developed and sound mathematical theory .",
    "the formal trace is then the spectral zeta function of the elliptic pdo exhibiting analytical properties in the complex @xmath4-plane of the exponent .",
    "nevertheless , use of the zeta function with the purpose of regularizing divergences in qft requires to dispose of more detailed information about its description .",
    "the usual strategy developed by the physicist s community is to take profit of the more tractable spectral heat function to pass to the zeta function via mellin transform , see e.g. references @xcite . in particular it is a common technique in dealing with quantum fields on curved spaces and/or extended / solitonic backgrounds to start from the high - temperature ( short time ) asymptotic expansion of the heat equation kernel following the seminal works of dewitt @xcite and gilkey @xcite .",
    "all this machinery is well behaved if the field fluctuations are strictly @xmath2 . in qft , however , two charactristic of the spectrum of the pdo at the stake disturb this naif picture : ( 1 ) first , usually there are fluctuations belonging to the continuous spectrum . to cope with this problem one",
    "put the system in a normalization box and impose periodic boundary conditions on the fields .",
    "equivalently , a toric variety is taken as space and only at the end the volume is allowed to go to infinity .",
    "( 2 ) second , much more dangerous is the existence of massless particles and/or zero mode fluctuations . these long range fluctuations do not disappear in the low temperature ( long time ) regime and use of the high temperature asymptotics is made dubious .",
    "barvinsky and vilkovisky proposed to introduce non - local terms to treat this problem in covariant perturbation theory , see e.g. reference @xcite , an idea that was put at work by gusev and zelnikov @xcite to compute the effective action in dilatonic two - dimensional gravity .",
    "recall that effective actions are related to determinants of elliptic pdo , susceptible of being regularized by means of the derivative of the spectral zeta function at the origin of the @xmath4-complex plane .",
    "e. weinberg in @xcite showed an index theorem in the open @xmath5-plane for the deformation operator arising from the linear perturbations of the first - order partial differential equations satisfied by self - dual / bps vortices .",
    "the theorem , see also @xcite , stated that the algebraic kernel of the deformation operator has dimension @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vorticity .",
    "this means that there exist @xmath6 linearly independent zero modes of fluctuation around bps vortices .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to compute the quantum correction to the bps vortex string tension induced by the vortex fluctuations taking into account the existence of these vortex zero modes .",
    "essentially we shall follow an strategy similar to that developed in @xcite and @xcite but we shall adapt our treatment to the heat kernel / zeta function procedure as applied in quantum theory of solitons .",
    "in fact , in reference @xcite we proposed and tested the improved heat kernel expansion , with the impact of zero modes , in one scalar field theory models in order to compute one - loop kink mass shifts .",
    "the idea was to include in the heat kernel expansion a ( non local ) term that takes care of the effect of zero modes surviving in the low temperature range .",
    "this modification allowed a much more precise evaluation of the mellin s transform extending the integration interval to all the temperature range .",
    "because in the kink case many exact evaluations of kink mass quantum corrections are known we were able to check that the improved heat kernel expansion offered much better approximations as compared with the results obtained by using the standard gdw method .",
    "moreover , in reference @xcite we extended the procedure to many component scalar field theory . in these type of models",
    "there are families of bps kinks in such a way than other kink zero modes besides the translational zero mode arises .",
    "the results also were much more precise than those previously obtained using the standard gdw expansion , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more interesting , in this last paper we do not only consider the problem in @xmath8-dimensional space - time but we analyzed the one - loop fluctuations in a three dimensional perspective where kinks become domain walls . in reference",
    "@xcite the same problem was addressed over standard supersymmetric kink domain walls relying on dimensional regularization procedures .",
    "our method method consequently also works for extended objects of @xmath9-brane type and , in the case of the model we studied , an interesting phenomenon was unveiled : within a family of classically degenerate bps kinks repulsive forces were induced by the quantum fluctuations that broke the classical degeneracy .",
    "we plan to address identical issue in the moduli space of bps vortices in the abelian higgs model .",
    "jaffe and taubes showed in @xcite that the vortex moduli space is the set of @xmath7 unordered points in @xmath5 .",
    "as a consequence vortices with one quantum of magnetic flux move freely without any interaction .",
    "the @xmath10 vortex zero modes obey to this freedom in the critical point between type ii and type i superconductivity phases , in the first case surge repulsive whereas in the second case attractive forces between vortices .",
    "we shall discuss wehther or not this classical picture is maintained at one - loop order after the effect of vortex fluctuations is accounted for .",
    "we shall perform the pertinent calculations generalizing the improved gdw heat kernel procedure developed previously for scalar field theories to abelian gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the analysis will be first focused in the planar ahm where the bps vortices are topological solitons .",
    "after that we shall move to study the same problem in a three dimensional space , where we find bps vortices magnetic tubes or vortex strings . to perform this task , evaluation of the quantum corrections to bps vortices by using the modified gdw expansion we need a detailed information of the spectrum of the matrix second - order pdo that governs the vortex fluctuations . all the information needed about vortex zero modes and bound states",
    "is collected in our recent papers @xcite and @xcite where pertinent references can be found .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  .2",
    "we thoroughly address the planar system .",
    "subsection  .2.1 summarize the well known facts about planar bps fluctuations , in sub - section  .2.2 the modified or improved gdw heat kernel expansion is generalized to planar abelian gauge systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking by one scalar field , and finally , in sub - section  .2.3 the one - loop mass shifts of rotationally symmetric planar bps vortices are computed .",
    ".3 is fully devoted to describe the quantum corrections at one loop order of the bps vortex string tensions in the three dimensional abelian higgs model . some conclusions and further comments",
    "are offered in section  .4 .",

    "it is well known that these magnetically charged objects are also solutions of the second - order static field equations and , because they satisfy the pde system ( [ pde1 ] ) , the bps vortices are absolute minima of the action in the different topological sectors characterized by @xmath7 . therefore , these bps or self - dual vortices are stable .",

    "perturbations of these vortex classical solutions in the form @xmath48 respond to small fluctuations around the topological defects and open a window to observe the behaviour of these objects in the quantum world up to the semi - classical or one - loop order .",
    "the analysis of the physics of the bps vortex small fluctuations starts by assembling them in a four - component column which we write as the transpose of the four - component field vector @xmath49 in order to avoid spurious pure gauge fluctuations we impose the background gauge condition @xmath50 which can be generated as a field equation by adding to the action the following gauge fixing term : @xmath51 ^ 2 \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ] the expansion of the action up to quadratic order in the fluctuations plus the gauge fixing term reads @xmath52 \\xi(x^0,\\vec{x})\\right\\}+o(\\xi^3)\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the hessian or second - order fluctuation operator and terms of third and quartic order in the perturbations are neglected . in the operator @xmath54 we denote : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this background",

    "we develope this program by using the symbolic software platform _",
    "mathematica_. the code of this task can be found in the web page http//:campus.usal.es/@xmath276mpg / general / mathematicatools.htm . estimation of the matrix and functional traces of these densities provides us with the previously mentioned seeley coefficients .",

    "from the results in this work we draw two main conclusions :    * the modified gilkey - dewitt heat kernel expansion designed in references @xcite and @xcite to control the impact of zero modes in the calculations of quantum corrections to kink masses and domain wall surface tensions due to one - loop fluctuations in scalar field theory has been successfully generalized to analyze one - loop fluctuations of both planar and cylindrical bps vortices in the abelian higgs model . * the new estimations are more precise than those obtained in @xcite and @xcite by using the standard gilkey - dewitt expansion .",
    "the new data clearly suggest that weak repulsive forces between bps vortices arise caused by the one - loop fluctuations . in extended @xmath1 supersymmetry , however ,",
    "the one - loop vortex mass shift and the central charge are adjusted in such a way that one may say the bps bound is preserved at the quantum level , see @xcite .",
    "we stress that our calculations have been performed over vortex solutions with a few number of quanta of magnetic flux . in reference",
    "@xcite the dual situation has been analyzed .",
    "the authors addressed the quantization of a bunch of magnetic flux quanta in a parallelogram so high that the bradlow limit was almost reached .",
    "this means that , after imposing quasi - periodic boundary conditions on the fluctuations , the magnetic flux of the vortex configuration is very close to the area of the equivalent genus one riemann surface .",
    "exactly at the bradlow bound the zero modes form the first landau level in this riemann surface and a reshaping of the work of ferreiros at al from the point of view proposed in this paper will be probably rewarding .",
    "although the new technique has been designed to deal with one - loop fluctuations or vacuum energies of low dimensional topological solitons one may speculate with its application to other extended objects supporting zero modes of fluctuation .",
    "for instance , it is tempting to try this quantization method on the bps magnetic monopoles of the bosonic sector in the @xmath277 susy gauge theory of seiberg and witten , see @xcite , and compare the results obtained with those achieved in the supersymmetric framework in @xcite .",
    "we have successfully applied the improved zeta function procedure in calculations of domain wall surface tension @xcite and in the regularization of tunnel determinants in quantum mechanics , see @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that the new method may be also effective in the analysis of tunnel determinants appearing in connection with yang - mills and/or gravitational instantons , see @xcite .",
    "other objects of the greatest physical interest as black holes may be understood as solitons , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus , our method is of potential interest in dealing with quantum fields in the background of solitonic black holes .",
    "to finish , one might think about the applicability of the improved gilkey - dewitt expansion to more exotic topological solitons as , for instance , the bps vortices of two species arising in the gauged non - linear @xmath278 @xcite , or , to compactons appearing in models with higher - order kinetic terms , see @xcite where one - loop correction to their classical masses have been computed .",
