    "in august 1982 j.  d.  bjorken published a preprint @xcite on `` energy loss of energetic partons in quark - gluon plasma : possible extinction of high @xmath0 jets in hadron - hadron collisions '' , in which he discussed that high energy quarks and gluons propagating through quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) suffer differential energy loss , and where he further pointed out that as an interesting signature events may be observed in which the hard collisions may occur such that one jet is escaping without absorption and the other is fully absorbed .",
    "the arguments in this work have been based on elastic scattering of high momentum partons from quanta in the qgp , with a resulting ( `` ionization '' ) loss @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the energy density of the qgp .",
    "the loss turns out to be less than the string tension of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , as in qed , bremsstrahlung is another important source of energy loss @xcite . due to",
    "multiple ( inelastic ) scatterings and induced gluon radiation high momentum jets and leading large @xmath0 hadrons become depleted , quenched @xcite or may even become extinct .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that a genuine pqcd process ( fig .  [ fig : rad ] ) is responsible for the dominant loss : after the gluon is radiated off the energetic parton it suffers multiple scatterings in the medium . indeed , further studies by @xcite support this observation @xcite .    in the following",
    "i mainly concentrate on the influence of the medium - induced energy loss on the large @xmath0 leading hadron spectrum .",
    "more about the recent theoretical developments can be learned from the contributions to the `` high transverse momentum '' session at this conference @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that for the first time large @xmath0 leading hadron data from @xmath4 collisions have been measured by the phenix and star collaborations at rhic @xcite .",
    "after its production in a hard collision the energetic parton radiates a gluon which both traverse a finite size @xmath5 medium .",
    "due to its non - abelian nature and its interaction with the medium this gluon follows a zig - zag path ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rad ] ) , with a mean free path @xmath6 , which is the range of screened multiple gluon interactions .",
    "it can be shown that the average energy loss of the parton ( in the limit @xmath7 ) due to gluon radiation with a spectrum @xmath8 is determined by the characteristic gluon energy @xmath9 as follows , @xmath10 where @xmath11 the medium dependence is controlled by the transport coefficient @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density of the medium ( a nucleus , or partons ) and @xmath14 the cross section of the gluon - medium interaction . in order to understand ( [ loss ] )",
    "the coherent pattern of the induced gluon radiation is important .",
    "the following semiquantitative arguments are crucial :    @xmath15 number of coherent scattering centers , which act as a single source of gluon radiation : @xmath16    @xmath15 coherence / formation time : @xmath17    @xmath15 random walk of emitted gluon ( fig .",

    "gluon dynamics is responsible for the following important relations :    @xmath31 relation to @xmath32 broadening    due to multiple scatterings off nucleons there is transverse momentum broadening of the gluon , @xmath33 such that the differential energy loss is expressed by @xcite @xmath34    @xmath31 relation to `` saturation scale '' @xmath35 @xcite    the saturation momentum of gluons for central gluon - nucleus ( radius @xmath36 ) collisions at small @xmath37 is given by @xcite , @xmath38   ~2 r_a \\ ,   = 2 r_a~ \\hat{q } \\ , .\\ ] ]    @xmath39 medium dependence of @xmath27    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] the dependence of @xmath27 as a function of the energy density of ( equilibrated ) media is shown ; e.g. for qgp the number density is translated into @xmath2 as @xmath40 . a `` smooth '' increase of @xmath27 with increasing @xmath2 is observed , such that    @xmath41    however , it is difficult to deduce from the behaviour indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , how the qcd phase transition near @xmath42 @xcite may be observed by measuring jet quenching .",
    "@xmath39 expanding medium @xcite    in case of a dynamically expanding collision region the gluon radiation spectrum , and the resulting energy loss depend on an effective @xmath43 , equivalent to a static coefficient , which is obtained by    @xmath44    when @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the starting time of the expansion , which , however , may not be very small .",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to bjorken s longitudinal expansion @xcite .",
    "which medium is actually probed by quenching ? according to the possible time behaviour of the hadronic system produced in heavy ion collisions : colour glass condensate in the initial state - ( non - equilibrated ) quark gluon matter - qgp - mixed phase @xcite , it is most likely that the hard probes propagate through different expanding , not necessarily thermalized , but dense gluonic media .",
    "the yield of inclusive large @xmath49 hadrons in @xmath50 collisions is essentially modified due to the radiative medium induced energy loss , leading to significant jet quenching , i.e. to a shift of the leading particle / pion spectrum    @xmath51    or , by introducing the medium dependent _ quenching factor _",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 which is related to the _ shift _ @xmath54 by    @xmath55    the vacuum leading hadron distribution is a steeply falling spectrum with increasing @xmath56 , in terms of an effective power @xmath57 , @xmath58 i.e. at rhic : @xmath59 .",
    "this behaviour causes a strong bias leading to an additional suppression of real gluon emission , with the important result that the shift is @xmath56 dependent and that @xmath60    the _ additional _ energy loss due to medium induced gluon radiation in the final state is characterized by the probability @xmath61 that radiated gluons carry away the energy @xmath62 by independent emission of soft primary gluons , @xmath63 \\delta \\left(\\e - \\sum_{i=1}^n   \\omega_i\\right ) \\cdot \\exp \\left [ - \\int d\\omega \\frac{di}{d\\omega } \\right ]   \\ , ,   \\label{prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the inclusive soft lpm gluon spectrum given above ( fig .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] . to obtain the inclusive hadron spectrum the vacuum production cross section at energy @xmath66 has to be convoluted with the distribution @xmath61 , @xmath67 the resulting quenching factor @xmath68 scales in the dimensionless variable @xmath69 fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows a significant suppression for small @xmath70 , i.e. for a hot medium @xmath71 .",
    "typical @xmath70 values are for @xmath72 cold matter ( @xmath73 ) @xmath74 , hot matter ( @xmath75 ) @xmath76    in the region of interest for rhic data the shift is plotted in fig .",

    "fig : fig11 ] , i.e. there is less energy loss and less suppression for heavy quarks than for pions .",
    "this effect could be studied experimentally in the @xmath101 ratio in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "after 20 years the studies of hard / large @xmath0 phenomena in nucleus - nucleus collisions in the context of ( p)qcd are now becoming very exciting , since more and more detailed information is available",

    "remaining open questions are related e.g. to the determination of the precise properties of the dense medium ( cold hadronic , colour glas condensate , qgp , .. ) , and to the relevant time scales : non - equilibrium versus thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "detailed quantitative predictions , including more complete treatments of the collision geometry @xcite , have still to be worked out . as reference and comparison @xmath107 and @xmath108 data have to be taken .",
    "the first indications of the presence of parton energy loss form a promising start for the further studies of jet physics , especially for lhc , where jets with energies of @xmath109 will be measured and where , due to the medium induced gluon radiation , a characteristic dependence on the finite angular jet cone is predicted @xcite ."
