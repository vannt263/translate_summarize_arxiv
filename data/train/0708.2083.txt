    "the ability to access the higher free energy states on ( @xmath84-@xmath7 ) time scale is a consequence of the conformational heterogeneity of the enzyme which leads to low barriers separating the relevant kinetic states . in dhfr , this is reflected in the broad tse with heterogeneous structures that results in a broad distribution of crossing times between the allosteric states .",
    "we also obtained the temperature ( @xmath85 ) dependence of the rates of the forward and reverse transition for the wt and the forward transition for the cl .",
    "the rates were computed by fitting the time dependence of @xmath39 for @xmath85 in the range @xmath86 .",

    "if the two states are comparable then the conformational changes during the cs@xmath0os transition might be coupled to hydride transfer . in general , it is important to formulate a method that couples the dynamics of the cs@xmath0os transition ( including the cofactors ) and the chemical step",
    ". such a formalism must account for both the kinetics of transitions along the lines described here and the hydride transfer processes described by others @xcite .",
