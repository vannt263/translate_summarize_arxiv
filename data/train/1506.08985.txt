    "lattice qcd predicts that , under conditions of extremely high temperatures and energy densities , a phase transition or crossover from hadronic matter to a new form of matter , known as quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite , will occur .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) was built to search for the qgp and to study its properties in laboratory through high - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "many observables have been proposed to probe the qgp created in heavy - ion collisions . among them , the @xmath5 suppression caused by the color - charge screening in qgp is one of most important signatures  @xcite .    over the past twenty years",
    ", @xmath5 production in hot and dense medium has been a topic attracting growing interest .",
    "suppression of @xmath5 production has been observed in various experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "a similar suppression pattern and magnitude of @xmath5 was observed at sps and rhic despite of huge collision energy difference .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath5 is suppressed more in forward rapidity than that in midrapidity at rhic 200 gev au@xmath4au collisions  @xcite .",
    "these experimental observations suggest that , in addition to color screening , there exist other effects contributing to the modification of @xmath5 production .",
    "cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , the combined contribution of finite @xmath5 formation time and finite space - time extent of qgp and recombination from uncorrelated c and @xmath6 in the medium may account for these contributions  @xcite . among these contributions ,",
    "the regeneration of @xmath5 from the recombination of c@xmath6 plays an important role to explain the similar suppressions at sps and rhic . as the collision energy increases ,",
    "the regeneration of @xmath5 from the larger charm quark density would also increase which partly compensates for the additional suppression from color - screening .",
    "the regeneration also expects a stronger suppression at forward rapidity at rhic where the charm quark density is lower than that at midrapidity . at lhc ,",
    "the @xmath5 is less suppressed in both mid - rapidity and forward rapidity than that at rhic  @xcite , which may indicate that the regeneration contribution is dominant in the @xmath5 production at lhc energies .",
    "measurements of @xmath5 in different collision energies at the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) can give us indications on the balance of these mechanisms for @xmath5 production and medium properties .    to qualify the medium effects on the modification of @xmath5 production",

    ", star has collected abundant events of au@xmath4au collisions at @xmath7 and 62.4 gev , while the reference data in @xmath0 collisions is not in the schedule of rhic run plan . as what we did in ref  @xcite",
    ", we study the world - wide data to obtain the @xmath5 reference at these collision energies .    in this letter , we report an interpolation of the @xmath3-integrated and differential inclusive @xmath5 cross section in @xmath0 collisions at mid - rapidity to @xmath8 39 and 62.4 gev .",
    "we establish a strategy to estimate the inclusive @xmath5 cross section and kinematics at certain energy points , which makes the calculation of the @xmath5 nuclear modification factors for any colliding system and energy at rhic possible .",
    "the extrapolation is done in three steps .",
    "the first step is an energy interpolation of the existing total @xmath5 cross section measurements .",
    "the second step is the description of the energy evolution of the rapidity distribution .",

    "the measurements of @xmath5 hadroproduction have been performed for about forty years . in such a long period ,",
    "different experimental techniques have been utilized and different input information was available at the time of the measurements . therefore , comparison of different experimental results on an equal footing needs an update of the published values on several common assumptions and aspects .",
    "for example , the branching ratio of @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) have changed with time ; the assumed functional forms for the @xmath11 and @xmath3 shapes , which can be used to infer the total @xmath5 production , are different in different measurements ; and the treatment of the nuclear effects are not homogeneous . in this section ,",
    "we update all the results with the current best knowledge of branching ratios , kinematics and nuclear effects .",
    "the cross section for @xmath5 on a nuclear target is often characterized by a power law : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath5 proton - nucleon cross section and @xmath14 is the corresponding proton - nucleus cross section for a target of atomic mass number @xmath15 .     as a function of @xmath11 by various experiments in different collision energies .",
