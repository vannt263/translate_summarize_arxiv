    "a wide variety of chemical and physical systems exhibiting patterns and textures can be characterized by spatial modulations in thermodynamical equilibrium . some of the most common morphologies are stripes and circular droplets in two dimensions ( 2d ) , as well as sheets , tubes and spherical droplets in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "these systems are very diverse and include type i superconductor films , ferromagnetic films , block copolymers ( bcp ) , and even lipid bio - membranes  @xcite . in each case",
    "the physical origin of the order parameter and the pattern characteristic differ with length scales or periodicity that vary from mesoscopic scales of tens of nanometers in biological membranes  @xcite , to centimeters in ferrofluids  @xcite .",
    "the fact that such a vast variety of physical , chemical , and biological systems display morphological similarities , irrespective of the details of microscopic structure and interactions , is striking and can be explained by a generic mechanism of competing interactions @xcite .    a ginzburg - landau ( gl )",
    "expansion  @xcite applicable to modulated phases was introduced  @xcite by adding to the free energy a term preferring a specific wavelength @xmath0 .",
    "this gl - like approach works rather well close to the critical point ( weak segregation limit ) , and its advantage lies in its simplicity and analytical predictions . the added term in the gl free - energy expansion can be written as : @xmath1 ^ 2d^2r , \\label{brazovskii.e.q.}\\ ] ] this positive - definite form is known as the brazovskii form @xcite , and has a minimum at @xmath0 .",
    "close to the critical point ( the weak segregation limit ) , also called the order - disorder temperature ( odt ) in bcp systems , it has been shown by brazovskii  @xcite and leibler  @xcite that the amplitude of the most dominant @xmath2-mode , @xmath0 , grows much faster than other @xmath2-modes .",
    "this free - energy form and similar ones have been used extensively in the past to calculate phase diagrams and grain boundaries of modulated phases  @xcite , as well as to study the effects of chemically patterned surfaces on such phases  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "such coarse - grained models compare well with experimental phase diagrams  @xcite and grain boundaries studies of bcp  @xcite .",
    "other and more accurate numerical schemes exist and rely on self - consistent field theories ( scft ) , as well as monte carlo simulations .",
    "for a recent review of these complementary techniques see , e.g. , ref  @xcite .    in the present study we consider an extension of modulated phases that are diluted by a solvent .",
    "although our phenomenological approach can apply to any modulated phase , we apply it explicitly to symmetric lamellar phases of bcp diluted by a solvent in a variety of solvent conditions  @xcite . for example , in bad solvent conditions the phase separation between a bcp - rich phase and a solvent - rich phase allows us to explore the free interface between a bcp film and bad solvent ( vapor ) .",
    "our study is relevant to a large number of experimental situations where a bcp film is spin casted on a solid substrate  @xcite . as the solvent",
    "evaporates , the polymer / air free interface can deform , and the free interface self - adjust its shape in order to minimize the total free energy .",
    "another focus of our study is to consider the shape and orientation of multi - lamellar bcp domains , during phase separation between the polymer and a bad solvent .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in the next section we present our model , which is a generalization of phenomenological free - energy expansions used to model pure di - bcp systems .",
    "the free energy includes additional terms that depend on the solvent ( s ) and its coupling with the a / b relative composition . in section",
    "iii we present the bulk properties of the solvent - diluted bcp system , including an explanation of the period - doubling phenomena found for the polymer density and an analysis of the critical point in the low - solvent limit . in section iv , we present results for grain boundaries between lamellar domains of different orientations , and show how a chemically patterned substrate influences deformations of a flat free interface and formation of bcp droplets .",
    "we then proceed by calculating the temperature dependence of the lamellar - solvent surface tension for parallel and perpendicular lamellar orientations .",
    "we also show how such an anisotropic surface tension affects the shape of circular lamellar drops of bcp during the overall solvent / polymer phase separation process and compare with experiments .",
    "in this study we employ a phenomenological free - energy of mixing  @xcite of a ternary mixture composed of three components : @xmath3,@xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 components are the two components of a di - bcp  @xcite and have volume fractions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while @xmath5 is a solvent with volume fraction @xmath8 .",

    "there is no bilinear term @xmath36 and the lowest - order coupling term is @xmath37 .",
    "the free energy can be reduced to two simple limits .",

    "the bcp phase has a critical point ( odt ) at @xmath41 and for @xmath42 , only the disordered phase is stable .",
    "\\(ii ) another simple limit is obtained by setting @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) , yielding @xmath45 this is the free energy of a solvent / solute binary mixture , where @xmath24 is the solute volume fraction  @xcite . in the bulk , @xmath46 , and one gets a demixing curve between two macroscopically separated phases .",
    "the demixing curve terminates at a critical point located at @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since our free energy reduces to eq  [ eq_rhoeq1 ] for @xmath49 ( no solvent ) , a bcp phase for the pure a / b system exists as long as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the critical point ( odt ) . to gain some insight of the behavior for the ternary system with @xmath52 , we plot in figure  [ fig1 ] typical energy landscapes corresponding to the free energy @xmath17 of eq  [ eq_full - free - energy ] without the spatial - dependent @xmath34 and @xmath53 terms . in figure  [ fig1](a ) , @xmath54 is above the critical point , @xmath41 , and we notice three local minima denoted by @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "point @xmath5 , on the other hand , has low solute density ( @xmath58 ) and is composed of an equal amount of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , note also that the free energy is concave on the @xmath49 line .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) should be compared with [ fig1](b ) , for which @xmath60 . in this case , only two minima exist and are denoted as @xmath5 ( solvent rich as before ) and @xmath61 ( disorder solute - rich ) . for the d minimum",
    "the concentration @xmath62 is high and equal amounts of @xmath3 and @xmath4 component are present @xmath59 .",
    "the free energy is convex on the @xmath49 line .",
    "we conclude that modulations can only occur if the @xmath3 and @xmath4 minima exist so that the two component tend to phase separate , while the modulation term dictates the length scale of spatial modulations by having the @xmath25 composition oscillates between these two states .",
    "looking at figure  [ fig1](a ) along the symmetric @xmath43 line , we further remark that the free energy changes from being slightly concave at @xmath63 to highly convex close to @xmath64 .",
    "this change in convexity suggests that a lamellar phase in @xmath25 will only be energetically favorable at @xmath65 , because in the highly convex region only one minimum exists .",
    "it also suggests that the critical point @xmath66 will grow as @xmath62 decreases below @xmath49 .",
    "next , we would like to obtain an analytical expression of @xmath67 , for @xmath68 , while recalling that without any solvent , @xmath69 . we use the lamellar single - mode approximation , and expand the free energy in powers of @xmath70 . because @xmath71 , @xmath70 may serve as a small expansion parameter around the ( @xmath72 , @xmath43 ) corner of the phase diagram . expanding the entropy in eq  [ eq_full - free - energy ] to fourth order in @xmath70 results in : @xmath73 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ~k(\\nabla\\rho)^2 -\\mu_{\\rho}\\rho-\\mu_{\\phi}\\phi .",

    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that close to the critical point , where @xmath25 starts to modulate , the modulations in @xmath24 are small and their effect on the @xmath25 modulations can be neglected ( to be further justified below ) .",

    "the modulations in @xmath25 cause the overall bcp density , @xmath24 , to modulate as well .",
    "interestingly , the modulations in @xmath24 are found to have half the wavelength of the @xmath25 modulations .",
    "we would like to explain how this period doubling phenomenon is manifested in our formalism , and note that it has been already suggested and is not unique only to the lamellar phase  @xcite .    in figure  [ fig2 ] such oscillations in @xmath25 and @xmath24",
    "can be clearly seen , where the amplitude of the @xmath24 oscillations is much smaller than the @xmath25 ones .",
    "the reason for such oscillations is the nonlinear coupling between the @xmath25 and @xmath24 order parameters .",
    "as we restrict ourselves to the case of symmetric interactions between a / s and b / s , @xmath30 in eq  [ eq_full - free - energy ] , this coupling originates in our model only from the entropy terms . note that in figure 2 and in all subsequent figures we have chosen for convenience @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    in figure  [ fig3 ] we show the contour plot of the free energy for @xmath92 and @xmath54 .",
    "the spatial modulations in @xmath25 can be represented as an oscillatory path between the two free - energy minima denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the path between the two points will not take the direct route denoted by ` 1 ' for which @xmath46 , but rather a curved and longer route denoted by ` 2 ' , because the latter is energetically preferred as it avoids the energy barrier along the direct path .",
    "thus , oscillations in the @xmath25 order parameter induce oscillations in @xmath24 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath24 wavenumber is doubled ( @xmath93 ) , as compared with the @xmath25 wavenumber ( @xmath0 ) , can also be understood from figure  [ fig3 ] . for each cycle going from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and back , @xmath25 completes one cycle , while @xmath24 completes two cycles .",
    "we note that increasing @xmath28 will cause these oscillations to decrease their magnitude as the potential well in the @xmath24 direction moves to higher values of @xmath24 and becomes deeper .",

    "the approximation worsens not only when @xmath79 becomes large , but also next to the critical density @xmath119 when @xmath98 becomes smaller .",
    "we proceed by obtaining grain boundaries separating lamellar domains of different orientations .",
    "this problem was considered in the past for pure bcp boundaries  @xcite and here we extend it to solvent - diluted bcp lamellae .",
    "the lamellar / lamellar grain boundaries are obtained by minimizing numerically the free energy in a simulation box , with boundary conditions that are periodic on the vertical walls , while the top and bottom surfaces of the simulation box induce lamellar order with different orientations .",
    "such 2d patterns in @xmath25 and @xmath24 can be seen in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "the left panels show the @xmath25 patterns , whereas the right panels show the corresponding @xmath24 ones with a doubled wavenumber in their spatial periodicity , as was discussed in section  iii.b .",
    "omega - shaped tilt grain boundaries ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) and t - junction grain boundaries ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) are shown as examples of possible grain boundaries between lamellar phases and agree well with previous works on pure bcp systems  @xcite . due to the wavenumber doubling effect",
    "one can see in both figures  bulbs \" of higher density at the grain boundaries , which is more pronounced for the @xmath24 patterns than for the @xmath25 ones .",
    "this result is in agreement with experiments on dilute bcp systems  @xcite and calculations on blends of bcp and homopolymer acting as a solvent , which show that the homopolymer density is higher at the interfaces ( e.g. , t - junction ) .",
    "this probably can be explained in terms of a mechanism where the solvent molecules accumulate at the location where the bcp chains have large deformation and , hence , release some of their strain at the interface  @xcite .",
    "in general , the solvent is enriched at the interface in order to dilute the unfavorable interactions between the two polymer species .",
    "since a bcp lamella contains two a / b interfaces , their distance is half the lamellar spacing and can be obtained in other types of grain boundaries , as well as at interfaces between two coexisting phases at equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "chemically and topographically patterned surfaces with preferential local wetting properties toward one of the two polymer blocks result in a unique organization of bcp thin films and have been investigated thoroughly in experiments  @xcite .",
    "we will explore here the interplay between such chemical heterogeneities on surfaces and the structure of bcp thin films .",
    "the bulk bcp phase is placed in contact with a chemically patterned surface , modeled by two surface interactions : @xmath120 and @xmath121  @xcite , which are coupled linearly to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",

    ", we examine the effect of the patterned substrate on structure and orientation of a parallel ( l@xmath125 ) lamellar phase as can be seen in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the substrate is constructed in such a way that its field , @xmath126 , prefers the @xmath4 component in the surface mid - section , while is neutral elsewhere : @xmath127 in addition , the field @xmath128 is fixed to be zero on the entire substrate .",
    "the upper bounding surface of the simulation box is taken as neutral , while the vertical walls obey periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the deformation of the lamellar structure due to the surface pattern are clearly seen close to the substrate and decays fast into the lamellar bulk as was previously studied for pure bcp systems  @xcite .",
    "we can also address within our model and numerical scheme the _ free interface _ between a thin lamellar film in coexistence with a bad solvent ( vapor )  @xcite , as is schematically plotted in fig  [ fig8 ] .",
    "in particular , and motivated by experimental set - ups , we explore deformations of such a free interface and their coupling with domain nucleations as induced by different surface chemical patterings .    in order to allow deformations of the free interface ,",
    "we consider specifically the case where the segregation in @xmath24 is weak but that of @xmath25 is still strong .",
    "this is done by choosing @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( and @xmath132 for symmetric lamellae ) , while recalling that the critical point values are @xmath41 and @xmath133 ( see section ii ) .",
    "the effect of surface - induced modulation on a weakly - segregated interface is seen in figure  [ fig9 ] , where the lower surface is chosen to have the following step pattern : @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the entire substrate .",
    "this patterning causes a defect formation at the mid - point @xmath136 , where the change in @xmath126 occurs .",
    "the defect , in turn , induces a deformation of the solvent / polymer ( free ) interface , forming several terraces .",
    "the jumps in terrace height is about half of the lamellar periodicity , in agreement with previous results obtained on free interfaces in contact with chemical patterns using self - consistent field theory ( scft )  @xcite .",
    "a defect can also be obtained between the two lamellar orientations : parallel to the substrate ( @xmath137 ) and perpendicular one ( @xmath138 ) by choosing a patterned substrate that prefers the @xmath137 one in its mid - section and an l@xmath139 elsewhere : @xmath140 and @xmath135 for the entire substrate . as can be seen in figure  [ fig10 ]",
    ", this surface pattern causes a deformation of the free interface between the bcp ( lamellar ) and solvent phases . in the mid - section",
    ", l@xmath125 has a thickness of three layers ( @xmath141 ) , and a terrace then separates the mid - section l@xmath125 from the side ones where the l@xmath139 is the preferred orientation .",
    "moreover , the @xmath138 phase is deformed and tilted at the boundary with the l@xmath125 phase , and the width of this boundary increases as @xmath27 approaches its critical value .",
    "another way of deforming the free interface is to induce a bcp droplet by a patterned substrate in coexistence with the solvent phase .",
    "for that purpose the substrate is separated into a central section that prefers the bcp with @xmath142 ( bcp wetting condition ) , while on the rest of the surface @xmath143 , which repels the lamellar phase ( non - wetting condition that prefers the solvent ) .",
    "in addition , by manipulation the @xmath126 field , we can induce different domains inside the same droplet .",
    "such a case in which both @xmath138 and @xmath137 domains co - exist within the same bcp droplet is shown in figure  [ fig11 ] , with @xmath128 and @xmath126 given by : @xmath144 @xmath145 the patterning leads to central domain of the droplet in the @xmath137 orientation surrounded by two deformed @xmath138 domains that compensate between the height of the @xmath137 phase and the edges of the droplet .",
    "the morphologies and free - interface profiles found in this section result from substrate patterning , and are in agreement with the ones obtained recently using a more computationally intensive method of scft  @xcite .",
    "as seen in the preceding sections , our model describes different types of coexisting phases and their interfaces .",
    "we proceed by analyzing the surface tension between a solute - rich lamellar phase and a solvent - rich disordered phase as function of the phase separation controlling parameters : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "an illustration of the two coexisting phases in shown schematically in figure  [ fig8 ] , and our calculations are performed for @xmath146 systems of volume @xmath147 .",
    "the surface tension between any two coexisting phases ( i and ii ) , is defined as @xmath148/a$ ] , where @xmath149 is the projected area of the interfacial layer , and for convenience , each of the two phases occupies half of the total volume .",
    "coexistence between the two phases is achieved by tuning the appropriate chemical potentials .",
    "the free energy @xmath150 of a lamellar bcp phase of volume @xmath151 is calculated numerically by imposing periodic boundary conditions on the side boundaries and free boundary conditions on the upper and lower surfaces .",
    "the distance between top and bottom surfaces of the box , @xmath152 , is adjusted so that the free energy @xmath150 is minimized .",
    "this occurs when @xmath152 is an integer multiple of the modulated periodicity .",
    "therefore , @xmath150 corresponds to a lamellar phase with no defects , and with a free energy density @xmath153 .",
    "the same ( but much simpler ) procedure is used to calculate the bulk free energy of the second ( disordered ) phase , @xmath154 .",
    "this procedure is repeated iteratively until we find the chemical potential yielding two coexisting phases with @xmath155 . when the simulation box @xmath156 is big enough and for the proper chemical potentials , an initial guess of the upper ( i ) and lower ( ii ) phases will converge into two coexisting phases with a interface in between them .",
    "we would like to compare the surface tension between a symmetric lamellar phase ( @xmath43 ) and a solvent phase where the lamellae meet the l - s interface at different angles , for @xmath42 . by choosing proper initial conditions we consider two limiting lamellar orientations : parallel to the interface ( @xmath137 ) and perpendicular one ( @xmath138 ) . in principle , other angles @xmath157 can be chosen as was done in ref  @xcite but we only consider the two extreme cases of @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the corresponding surface tensions , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , are then computed as function of @xmath27 for @xmath162 and plotted on figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "as @xmath27 increases above @xmath163 , the segregation between the a / b components becomes stronger , causing an increases in the density change across the @xmath5 - @xmath164 interface .",
    "this leads to an increase of the two surface tensions , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , to increase .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath161 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath27 while @xmath160 is non - monotonic .",
    "however , while the segregation between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 component grows , the modulation amplitude reaches saturation , @xmath165 , causing the width of the boundary between a and b to diminish .",
    "this is in accord with ref  @xcite where similar trends with @xmath27 have been reported at the lamellar - disorder interface ( without a solvent ) . comparing the two orientations of the lamellar phase",
    ", it is seen that for low values of @xmath27 , the transverse orientation is preferred at the interface , while for larger @xmath27 values , @xmath137 is the preferred one .",
    "the crossover occurs at @xmath166 and indicates that the mere existence of the solvent interface may induce a preferred direction of bulk modulations .",
    "this result implies that by incorporating steric repulsion ( in which @xmath167 on any of the confining surfaces ) , the @xmath137 phase is preferred next to any neutral surface for large @xmath27 values .",
    "because @xmath168 and @xmath169 have very different dependence on @xmath27 , one might expect to see that an initial round droplet containing a lamellar bcp becomes oval .",
    "for example , by choosing @xmath170 and @xmath162 , @xmath171 causes the @xmath137 ",
    "@xmath5 interface to reduce its length , while the @xmath138  @xmath5 compensates and increases its length .",
    "this is seen in figure  [ fig13 ] . at initial times of the simulation",
    "[ figure  [ fig13](a ) ] , we have chosen a circular bcp droplet embedded in a solvent phase . the droplet is circular and the lamellae are preset to orient vertically . at progressive time steps of the simulation ,",
    "the lamellar orientation deforms so that the lamellae meet the interface at a right angle . as in our simulations",
    "the bcp droplet is metastable , it diminishes in size but not in a uniform way .",
    "because the parallel boundary diminishes faster ( @xmath171 ) , the droplet undergoes a continuous shape change , giving the droplet a biconvex lentil - shape at later time steps [ figure  [ fig13](d ) ] .",
    "if we continue the simulations even further , the droplet will eventually disappear , since the solvent phase is preferred .",
    "we would like to compare our findings with experimental ones .",
    "formation of lens - like bcp macro - domains embedded in a solvent matrix during solvent / polymer phase separation was observed experimentally  @xcite for blends of poly(styrene - block - isoprene ) and homopolystyrene acting as a bad solvent .",
    "the relationship between the macro - phase separation ( solvent / bcp ) and the self - assembly of the bcp inside the domains was reported and analyzed .",
    "although we can not offer a direct explanation of these experiments because our model is restricted to study lamellae in 2d , while in ref  @xcite cylindrical phases of bcp are studied in 3d , the resemblance of our fig . 15 with fig .",
    "5 of ref  @xcite is striking , and may be regarded as 2d cuts through the 3d cylindrical bcp domain .",
    "we note that in ref  @xcite a similar explanation for the creation of lens - like domains with orientation of the cylinders along the smaller lens axis was given , and is consistent with a difference in surface tension between the two orientations , @xmath172 .",
    "more recently , addition of au - based surfactant nanoparticles led to change in shape and morphology for particles based on poly(styrene - b-2-vinylpyridine ) diblock copolymers @xcite .",
    "the added nanoparticles are adsorbed at the interface between block copolymer - containing droplets and the surrounding amphiphilic surfactant . in turn",
    ", it causes a preferred perpendicular orientation of the bcp lamellae and led to distortion of the bcp droplets into ellipsoid - shaped ones .",
    "the system is more complex as it includes an additional component , but the explanation presented by the authors for the distorted shape is similar to ours and relies on the anisotropic surface tension as enhanced by the added au nanoparticles .    in another study  @xcite ,",
    "lamellar domain formation has been reported following a temperature quench from a disordered bcp phase to the lamellar one .",
    "the formed lamellar domains are lens - shaped with their axes along the smaller domain axis .",
    "it might be of interest to see if a large change in the final temperature of quenching may cause the formation of lens domains with parallel - oriented lamellae , as is predicted by our study , where @xmath161 and @xmath160 have different ( and non - monotonous ) temperature dependence .",
    "we also note that the nucleation of a droplet of stable cylinder phase from a metastable lamellar phase was examined within the single - mode approximation for bcp melts in ref .",
    "in this paper , we investigate bulk properties of solvent - diluted bcp phases , and a variety of interfaces between coexisting bcp and solvent phases , restricting ourselves to phases with the 1d ( symmetric lamellar ) morphology .",
    "the main assumption made is the dominant nature of a single @xmath0 mode close to the odt , which allows us to write a simplified mean - field form of the free energy .",
    "although the dominant @xmath0-mode can be justified in the weak - segregation limit ( close to odt ) , we believe that many of the reported results are qualitatively correct also at stronger segregation .    to further simplify the model ,",
    "the numerical investigations are conducted for the case where the interactions between the a and b monomers of the bcp and the solvent ( s ) are identical .",
    "namely , there is be no bilinear enthalpic term as @xmath36 in the free energy ( @xmath30 ) of eq  [ eq_full - free - energy ] .",
    "hence , the coupling between the two order parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath24 , originates only from entropy of mixing that enhances solvent mediation between the two incompatible species .",
    "this term is even in @xmath25 and its leading order is @xmath37 .    the coupling between @xmath24 , the volume fraction of the solute , and @xmath25 , the bcp relative a / b composition leads to two interesting analytical results valid in the low solvent limit , @xmath173 .",
    "first , the critical point @xmath174 that determines the onset of bcp phases becomes @xmath24 dependent , @xmath175 .",
    "second , due to the non - linear nature of the coupling , modulations in @xmath25 induce modulations in @xmath24 , with a doubled wavenumber , as was explained in detail in section  iii.b .",
    "this phenomenon also results in formation of density bulbs at the interface between a modulated bcp and a disordered phase ( figures  @xmath176 and @xmath177 ) .",
    "we show how the presence of a chemically patterned substrate leads to deformations of the free interface separating polymer - rich phase from a solvent - rich one .",
    "the patterns can induce formation of terraces in lamellar bcp film and even formation of multi - domain droplets .",
    "our results are in agreement with previous self - consistent field theory calculations  @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to remark on the rotational - symmetry breaking of bcp domains at the bcp / solvent coexistence .",
    "we found that the surface tension of the parallel phase ( @xmath160 ) is higher than that of the transverse phase ( @xmath161 ) for values of @xmath27 close to @xmath174 , while the opposite occurs for large @xmath27 values in agreement with ref  @xcite .",
    "this crossover causes a bcp lamellar phase to change its orientation relative to the interface as one changes @xmath27 , and should be taken into consideration , as it may be used to induce some preferred direction or interfere with such an attempt .",
    "this difference in surface tension causes bcp droplets to deform .",
    "we believe that it represents a general phenomenon that can be applied to other situations , such as the shape of domains composed of a hexagonal bcp phase coexisting with a solvent phase .",

    "it was applied to minimize the ginzburg - landau free - energy expansion , given in eq  [ eq_full - free - energy ] .",

    "the free energy is coupled to some surface field that can be uniform or represents a surface pattern .    as our model does not include random fluctuations , the initial guess of the order parameters",
    ", @xmath25 and @xmath24 , plays an important role . in some cases a random initial guess is used to make the solver converge to the absolute minimum ( which is very time demanding ) , while in other cases a well chosen initial guess is used to speed convergence , especially when it is applied to model the interface between two coexisting phases .",
    "we repeated the numerics by starting from several initial conditions in order to check that the convergence is toward the global free - energy minimum .",
    "when the thermodynamics dictates that only one phase is at thermodynamical equilibrium , the average value of the order parameters can be adjusted by changing the chemical potential related to them . in a coexistence region of two ( or more ) phases defined by setting the chemical potentials to their proper values ,",
    "the total bcp amount is not conserved for two - phase coexisting phases during the numerical iterations of the cg algorithm . however , the local convergence of the lamellar phase and corresponding interface is much faster and our results indicate qualitatively the system state .",
