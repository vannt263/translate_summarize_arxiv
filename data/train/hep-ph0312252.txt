    "energy loss of high energy quark and gluon jets in relativistic a+a collisions leads to jet quenching and thus probes the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "recently the considerable suppression of hadron spectra at moderately high @xmath2 gev was found in the central au + au collisions , especially for @xmath0 production  @xcite .",
    "this suppression can be explained by the energy loss of the moderate @xmath3 gev gluons jets .",
    "this is one of the major new results at rhic energy , which has not been observed before at lower sps energy .",
    "the energy loss was investigated in the work  @xcite in various orders in opacity @xmath4(where @xmath5 is nuclear radius and @xmath6 is the gluons mean free path ) .",
    "it was shown that these series is strongly dominated by the first term .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that finite kinematic boundaries decrease the energy loss at intermediate jet energies as compared to the asymptotic limit .",
    "recently , in paper @xcite , the physical characteristics of initial plasma phase and also of mixed phase at sps and rhic energies ( i.e. the values @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) were investigated on the basis of the quasiparticle model and isentropic expansion . in the present work we use these initial conditions for investigation of the energy loss of high energy gluon and quark jets at rhic energy . in these studies",
    "we take into account also the possibility of two stages of equilibrium , i.e. production of the hot glue at first stage  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of energy loss is important for investigation of the phase transition structure of quark - gluon plasma into hadrons . in the refs .",
    "@xcite the phenomenological parametrization of coupling constant @xmath10 was used in accordance with new lattice data .",
    "when approaching to phase transition point from above , the decrease of thermodynamic values is caused , according to @xmath11 gauge theory , by increase of the thermal gluon mass and also of the coupling constant @xmath10 . in these conditions",
    "the applicability of perturbation theory is questionable . in phenomenological model of confinement",
    "@xcite the decrease of thermal gluon mass @xmath12 at @xmath13 from above is assumed , which is connected with decrease of effective coupling strength @xmath10 .",
    "it can be understood , as the more and more gluons become confined and form heavy glueballs with decrease of t , and the effective glueball exchange interaction between gluons are reduced . however , in this case the entropy density @xmath14 will exceed the lattice entropy because of domination of light masses near @xmath15 .",
    "this difference may be accounted for in quasiparticle model by modification of the number of effective degrees of freedom in thermodynamic functions : @xmath16 the explicit value @xmath17 may be estimated as ratio of the lattice entropy and the quasiparticle entropy density @xmath18 with decrease of the mass @xmath12 . at @xmath19",
    "we have @xmath20 , and near @xmath21 we have @xmath22 .",
    "the value @xmath17 for gluons has the form @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 1.25 , @xmath25 0.0026 , @xmath26 0.31 .",
    "the thermal mass @xmath12 can be parameterized well by formula : @xmath27 where @xmath28 0.1 , @xmath29 10@xmath30 .",
    "it possible to vary some parameters , for example @xmath31 10@xmath32 are reasonable  @xcite . the form ( [ eq.3])is analogous to behaviour of debye mass @xmath33 , extracted from lattice data  @xcite . the value @xmath34 can be determined by asymptotic value of the thermal mass , chosen from coincidence of lattice and perturbative masses at @xmath35 @xcite",
    ". we had found for pure gluons : @xmath36 1.9 @xcite .    the relations ( [ eq.2 ] ) , ( [ eq.3 ] ) with above - mentioned parameters give good description of @xmath11 lattice data for entropy @xmath37 , energy density @xmath38 , and pressure @xmath39 for @xmath40 close to @xmath15 .",
    "it is possible to extend the effective quasiparticle model to a system with dynamic quarks , with analogous effective coupling @xmath10 , and the function @xmath41 with some variation of parameters  @xcite .",
    "one can show that the same constant @xmath42 1.9 describes the lattice data for 2 and 2 + 1 flavors ( for example , the lattice pressure  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the massive constituent quarks ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) appears also due to the decrease of number of degrees of freedom in the presence of octet of pseudogoldstone states .",
    "this is a consequence of conservation of the entropy and of the number of net nucleons .",
    "it can also be demonstrated that hadrons ( in the hadronic part of the mixed phase ) appears with the same effective number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it can be shown , that such picture of phase transition ( with decrease of effective coupling strength @xmath10 near @xmath45 ) gives reasonable quantitative description of the jet quenching and of suppression of the hadronic spectra in the central au + au collisions at rhic energy .",
    "however , the use of the `` running '' coupling @xmath46 in the perturbative decomposition of the thermodynamic values in plasma leads to too large energy loss of jets , which disagrees with experimental data for suppression of the hadrons with large @xmath47 at rhic energy .    in the ref .",
    "@xcite we do not find a noticeable difference for meson and baryon spectra in the ordinary perturbative theory with the running coupling @xmath46 and also in model with phenomenlogical parametrization of coupling @xmath10 @xcite in comparison with the effective quasiparticle model .",
    "however , the ordinary perturbative model disagrees with @xmath11 lattice data in the region of phase transition .",
    "thus the spectra of particles apparently weakly depend on the character of phase transition .",
    "therefore the investigation of jet quenching represent significant interest .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we calculate the energy loss of the high energy gluon and quark jets in quark - gluon plasma at rhic energy . in these calculations",
    "we use the initial conditions in plasma at sps and rhic energies , which were found in the quasiparticle model  @xcite .",
    "we also take into account here the production of hot glue at the first stage .",
    "we show that the energy loss at sps energy is too small .",
    "we show also , that in the perturbative theory the energy loss of gluon jets is too large .    in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we calculate the suppression of @xmath0 at moderate @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) gev in the central au+au collisions . we take into account the jet quenching and the parton shadowing factor in nucleus .",
    "we show that suppression of the @xmath0 spectra at @xmath49 gev / c does not contradict the experimental data at rhic energy .",
    "in the effective quasiparticle model  @xcite we have investigated the initial condition and the evolution of the plasma stage , where there is equilibrium for both quarks and gluons .",
    "we have found for rhic case the values @xmath50 mev , @xmath51 fm and @xmath52 fm . we have also found corresponding values for sps energy @xmath53 mev , @xmath54 fm , @xmath55 fm , so , here we have the short plasma stage .",
    "the production of a more hot glue plasma at the first stage is caused by the relatively large @xmath56 cross section in comparison with the @xmath57 and @xmath58 cross section of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the lowest order , the matrix elements @xmath59 in formula : @xmath60 at large angles are related thus as @xcite : @xmath61 i.e.  @xmath56 scattering is most important .",
    "the small angle scattering leads to divergent cross - sections , which however are finite in @xmath62 due to the finite `` debye mass '' @xmath63 .",
    "the cross section at large angles is defined by formula : @xmath64 the cross section at small angles has the form : @xmath65 the effective scattering rate @xmath66 is determined by a sum of large and small angle values : @xmath67 here the value @xmath68 is determined by the effective coupling constant @xmath69 , where : @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see eq .",

    "we make the following assumptions : at the first stage we have the hot glue in equilibrium and nonequilibrium quarks .",
    "the total entropy of gluons and such quarks ( at temperature @xmath78 ) is less than the entropy of gluons and _ all _ quarks at more a later stage ( at above mentioned temperature @xmath7 ) . with expansion of the system",
    "the temperature decreases and the entropy of quarks and gluons decreases ( if to assume that all the quarks are nonequilibrium ones ) .",
    "however , in reality , some part of quarks achieves equilibrium and entropy increases . with subsequent decrease of t the number of equilibrium quarks increases , and near @xmath7 we have the equilibrium of both gluons and quarks .",
    "after that the cooling becomes isentropic .",
    "one can estimate the fraction of gluons and sea @xmath79 quarks ( and antiquarks ) from the structure function @xcite , if to imagine the system moving backward in time from many secondaries into hot partonic plasma .",
    "this approach has to normalize parton multiplicity to the total entropy , later observed as multiplicity of secondaries .",
    "we assume its conservation at later stage ( for @xmath80 ) and its additional production at previous stage  @xcite .",
    "for average number of partons ( for example , gluons in nucleon ) we use formula  @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is structure function , @xmath83 is characteristic hadrons mass , and @xmath84 is nucleon momentum . for rhic energies we have @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , the number of the sea quarks is @xmath86 this gives estimate @xmath87 .",
    "this correspond to known fact , that gluons dominate in structure function at small x : the number of gluons is more than twice larger than the number of sea quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the characteristic average value @xmath88 is close to value @xmath89 in the works of other authors ( for example e.v.shuryak ) .",
    "these meanings are reasonable for estimation of the hot glue temperature @xmath78 , since partons with @xmath90 carry only a small part of the total momentum . for estimation of the number of gluons in central region of rapidity we use the relation ( [ eq.12 ] ) : @xmath91 where @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 @xcite is the number of net nucleons for rhic in central region of rapidity ) .",
    "hence , the estimate for gluons is : @xmath94 taking into account eq .",

    "( [ eq.37 ] ) if the scaling @xmath269 is used : @xmath270 .",
    "this gives the value @xmath271 , which is close to experimental data available for charged particles .",
    "in this paper we investigate the energy loss of quark and gluon jets in the quark - gluon plasma and suppression of the @xmath0 spectra at rhic energy .",
    "we use the initial conditions in plasma , which were found earlier in the effective quasiparticle model for sps and rhic energies @xcite .",
    "we take into account also the possibility of production of the hot glue at the first stage with more high temperature and density .",
    "it can be shown , that plasma is sufficiently thin : @xmath272 , where @xmath273 is an average number of jet scatterings .",
    "the energy loss in expanding plasma is calculated in the dominant first order @xcite taking into account the finite kinematic limits .",
    "the energy losses @xmath142 of gluon and quark jets are calculated in a wide range of parton energies @xmath125 .",
    "these energy losses are used for calculation of suppression of @xmath0 spectra with moderately high @xmath47 ( @xmath274 gev / c ) , which is done by modification of gluon and quark fragmentation functions .",
    "we also take into account the parton shadowing factors in nucleus @xcite .",
    "we obtain a considerable suppression of @xmath0 spectra , which is caused by the effects mentioned above .",
    "this suppression agrees with the data reported by phenix in the region @xmath275 gev / c .",
    "the estimates of @xmath262 ( [ eq.37 ] ) in the soft region ( @xmath268 gev / c ) also agrees with experimental data if the scaling @xmath269 is taken into account .",
    "the intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath195 at rhic energy is neglected in this work .",
    "it is important at sps energy ( cronin effect ) , but at rhic energy one can neglect the effects of initial @xmath195 with a good precision @xcite . in principle",
    "a small increase of @xmath262 is possible at moderate @xmath47 because of transverse momentum broadening .",
    "we are planning to take into account the intrinsic @xmath195 in the next work .",
    "the most important conclusion of this work is the possibility to investigate the structure of the plasma phase transition into hadrons with the help of hard processes .",
    "the correct quantitative description of @xmath0 suppression is probably possible only in a model of phase transition which includes the decrease of thermal gluon mass @xmath12 and effective coupling @xmath10 near the phase transition ( @xmath45 ) point .",
    "however , the quasiparticle model with increase of these values at @xmath276 leads to a too high energy losses ( which can even exceed the energy of the jet itself ) . the main reason of this problem is too large value of the coupling @xmath10 near @xmath15 .",
    "we show also that energy losses at sps energy are very small as a consequence of a too low initial temperature of the plasma phase at this energy .",
