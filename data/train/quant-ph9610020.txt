    "one of the most fascinating open problems in the area of dynamical systems is the search for an adequate semiclassical description of quantum systems .",
    "several attempts focus on obtaining @xmath3 corrections to the dynamics of the corresponding classical system .",
    "a pioneer work along this idea is the semiclassical method proposed by einstein - brilloin - keller @xcite which leads to quantization rules for integrable systems .",
    "other important contributions are approximations to the feynman path integral formulation @xcite , used to derive the periodic orbit trace formula for chaotic systems : the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite .",
    "this relates the spectrum of quantum systems to a weighted sum over the unstable periodic orbits of the classical system .",
    "recently semiquantal dynamics has been derived via ehrenfest s theorem and recast as an extended classical system with the fluctuation variables coupled to the average variables @xcite @xcite . a different approach which can be shown to yield identical results",
    "is the time dependent variational principle where the true solution is approximated by squeezed states , the so called gaussian variational approximation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other methods for this propose are quoted in ref .",
    "the wigner formalism has also recently been applied to study diffusive and dissipative type of corrections @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present contribution is twofold .",
    "the first one is of formal character .",
    "we show that a mean field expansion in the sense of nonrelativistic many body theories can be used as a consistent and systematic tool to analyse the nature of quantum corrections to the classical limit .",
    "we show that such corrections can be classified in two types : unitary quantum corrections , which amount to considering ( on top of the dynamics of the average values ) the dynamics of the width of gaussian wave packets .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom of this system is therefore doubled , and the semiclassical limit can be cast into the form of hamilton s equations .",
    "this unitary dynamics reveals in particular general features of quantum kinematics - a centrifugal type barrier involving the width of the packet is the classical counterpart of the uncertainty principle - and the resulting dynamics is in general chaotic even if we start from a simple integrable system , as we will show .",
    "the same result in spirit has been obtained in the context of a variational calculation by pattanyak and schieve @xcite in the framework of heisenberg s equations of motion . the second type of corrections to the classical limit in the context of many body mean field calculation is non unitary in character . it arises from the inclusion of quantum correlation contributions .",
    "their inclusion induce , given adequate approximations , a langevin - type force on top of the hamiltonian description provided by the unitary evolution .",
    "they can thus formally account for diffusive and dissipative type behaviors , making immediate contact with the work of reference @xcite .",
    "the second purpose of the present work is to explore in detail the unitary type corrections in the context of the integrable @xmath0 lipkin model @xcite .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular model , aside its simplicity , resides in the fact that it possesses a well defined classical limit when the number of particles @xmath4 goes to infinity @xcite . in this case",
    "it can be rigorously shown that the classical limit corresponds to constructing the hamiltonian dynamics for the parameters of coherent states , a special case of gaussian wave packets . in this case",
    "we will be safe to perform comparisons between the classical , unitary semiclassical and exact dynamics .",
    "we show that the derived corrections improve the classical results both qualitatively and quantitatively . from the qualitative point of view",
    "we show that the presence of quantum degrees of freedom ( widths of wave packet ) induces chaotic motion and this is the mechanism through which quantum tunneling is effected , a clear quantum correction to the classical description . also from the qualitative point of view",
    "we analytically study the time evolution of observable for short times , investigating in this way modifications introduced by quantum corrections . from the quantitative point of view , in order to assess the time of validity of the approximation we perform a comparative numerical study of the time evolution given by the approximations and the exact result for the time evolution of observable .",
    "we show that despite of chaotic behavior the semiclassical or gaussian approximation gives a better description of the dynamics .",
    "we also set up a quantitative measure of the time of validity of the approximation according to which the gaussian approximation is better than the classical one and this quality increases with @xmath4 , as it should .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : section @xmath5 contains the formalism based on which we define the semiclassical limit , section @xmath6 contains an application to the @xmath0 lipkin model , section @xmath7 contains a discussion of our numerical results and section @xmath8 contains some conclusions .",
    "one of the most widely used method to construct the classical limit of a quantum system is by means of coherent states @xcite .",
    "as is well known such method can be viewed as a mean field approximation where the width of the wave packet is minimal and remains unchanged during the time evolution .",
    "the idea of defining the semiclassical limit as some kind of mean field approximation is appealing .",
    "a very general and unique definition of mean field approximation can be given once one requires that the density function which should be used to calculate traces be the one which reproduces in exact form all expectation values of one body operators . in other words a gaussian density operator @xcite .",
    "the formalism stated below is a simple application of techniques developed before for the treatment of the reduced dynamics of gaussian observable of interacting many boson systems in many body nuclear physics and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "we make here an option for self - containedness . in the eventual lack of technical details the reader",
    "is referred to the works in references @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "quantum bosonic states are represented by density operators @xmath9 so that mean values of a chosen operator @xmath10 are given in terms of traces , e.g.    @xmath11    and the basic dynamical equation is the liouville - von neumann equation for @xmath9 @xmath12 \\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "gaussian states are particular densities which are fully determined by the mean values of the field operators and their bilinear or quadratic combinations , in addition to statistics . for bosonic systems ( @xmath14=1 $ ] ) the relevant quantities are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the first of these can be conveniently parameterized in terms of two real quantities @xmath18 and @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the density matrix ( it will be defined later ) and @xmath22 is a scale parameter ( we set @xmath23 ) . to deal with",

    "notice that the operator @xmath53 in the expression of @xmath21 is a linear combination of the bosonic operators @xmath54 and the coefficients are functions of @xmath55 and @xmath41 . more technical details are given in the didactic work by de cloizeaux @xcite .",
    "it is a simple matter to check that @xmath21 need not be a pure state and that in the limit @xmath56 it goes to the pure gaussian state @xmath57 .",
    "this state precisely corresponds to the variational state used in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the usual coherent state approximation corresponds to setting @xmath58 and moreover requiring the fullfilment of the minimal uncertainty relation , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for all times .",
    "notice that the equation @xmath61 is a consequence of the definition of @xmath62 and therefore imposes no constraints on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore we have four undetermined parameters re@xmath63 , im@xmath63 , re@xmath64 and im@xmath64 and three conditions to fix them , namely , eq . ( 10 ) and the normalization condition .",
    "the fourth one can be obtained by imposing an overall null phase in the state @xmath21 .",
    "we now sketch the mean field expansion method : in general the state @xmath9 is not of the form @xmath21 , but even so can be used to evaluate @xmath65 and @xmath66 and hence a set of gaussian parameters . in terms of these",
    "we can set up a gaussian state @xmath21 and split the complete state @xmath9 as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 is a pure correlation part of @xmath9 .",
    "we make essential use of the fact that the decomposition ( 14 ) can be implemented in terms of a projection operator @xmath70 such that @xmath71 ( the explicit form of @xmath70 for bosons is given in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) to rewrite eq .",
    "( 14 ) as a set of coupled equations for @xmath21 and @xmath72 .",
    "this eventually allows one to write @xmath72 as a function of the past history of the gaussian projection @xmath73 :    @xmath74\\ ] ]    using this result one can close the equations of motion for the gaussian parameters again by taking appropriate traces of the liouville - von neuman equation ( 2 ) and using @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "the first term will reproduce the mean field result , while the second will give rise to additional terms involving memory integrals ( refs @xcite and @xcite ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the expression for equation ( 15 ) is in general not computable even in simple model problems without approximations .",
    "however a consistent and systematic approximation scheme has been constructed based on a criterium of energy conservation @xcite    @xmath76    so that to every order of approximation one makes sure that @xmath77 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and implemented in various systems @xcite @xcite this criterium leads to a systematic , controllable expansion around the mean field approximation .",
    "since we have defined @xmath78 the occupation probability does not evolve on time on the mean field approximation level ( unitary contributions ) .",

    "this has been explicitly studied in the context of the anharmonic oscillator @xcite and of the maser model @xcite , showing both qualitatively and quantitatively what are the effects of many body correlations at the level of one body observables . in the present work these nonunitary contributions",
    "have been neglected , since they are of higher order than the unitary ones .",
    "it is however worthwhile noticing that the inclusion of such corrections may lead to fokker - planck type equations making thus immediate contact with the works of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the classically corresponding invariant tori are localized in the two symmetric regions e@xmath250 with @xmath265 or @xmath266 exclusively and because of classical integrability the time evolution of any chosen initial condition will be confided on its respective region .",
    "therefore , destroying integrability is the way the quantum correction works to effect quantum tunneling .",
    "choosing an initial condition with energy @xmath267 in the @xmath268 semiplane as an example we show in figure 3(a ) its classical poincar section . for finite values of @xmath167 this same initial condition ( evolved semiclassically ) is able to access the symmetrical region @xmath269 ( figure 3(b ) ) .",
    "the quantum observable associated to the transition between the semiplanes @xmath265 and @xmath266 is @xmath270 .",
    "its mean value sign on the poincar section ( @xmath271 , @xmath272 ) is determined by the @xmath273 sign .",
    "@xmath274=sign[\\frac{1}{2}(q_b q_a + p_b p_a)]= sign[p_a ] \\;\\;\\;.\\ ] ]    the frequency of such transitions also depends on energy , increasing for energies near the separatrix and decreasing as @xmath167 increase .",
    "a quantitative measure of this process may be achieved by studying its time scale .",
    "we define the confinement time @xmath275 as the time interval between two transitions @xmath276 .",
    "we then divide it by the poincar time @xmath277 , _ i.e. _ , the amount of time required by starting with an initial condition on the poincar plane and evolving until it reaches the plane again .",
    "we take the average over the first thousand values of @xmath278 and evaluate the dimensionless quantity @xmath279 as a function of @xmath167 for different energies ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this quantity can also be interpreted as the average number of iterations of the poincar map necessary for a transition to occur . from the figure we note that the transitions become scarce as @xmath167 increase . for",
    "any finite value of @xmath167 there must occur a transition , although , for large values of @xmath167 ( or energies close to the minimum value ) this may require numerically integrating the equations of motion for an _ enormous _ amount of time . another interesting feature in figure 4 is the dependence on energy . for an energy close to the separatrix ( @xmath280 ) @xmath281 increases slower than for lower energies ( @xmath282 and @xmath283 ) .",
    "since tunneling effect manifests itself through chaotic motion it must be more conspicuous where chaos ( roughly speaking ) persists , _",
    "i.e. _ , near the separatrix .    notice that here we do not intend to rigorously define a tunneling rate ( in terms of energy splittings ) , which is an interesting problem in itself in particular for spin systems , we are just characterizing the phenomenon in the gaussian representation .",
    "an important question that naturally arises in this work concerns the time evolution of observables .",
    "since the nonintegrability of the semiclassical description is alien both to the quantum and classical dynamics of the system , it is natural to ask whether the approximation makes sense quantitatively .",
    "we show that despite of introducing chaos the inclusion of the quantum degrees of freedom @xmath262 gives a better approximation to the time evolution of the observable @xmath284 which we analyse as an example .",
    "in figure 5 we display @xmath284 ( @xmath252 , @xmath285 ) for the three cases : the exact calculation , the semiclassical approximation and the classical result . as can be seen from the figure the semiclassical approximation represents an improvement over the classical result .",
    "we have checked that this is always true for short enough times .",
    "the validity of the approximation is of course sensitive to the value of @xmath240 .",
    "we next arbitrarily define one possible quantitative measure of the accuracy of the approximations .",
    "consider the expression    @xmath286    in figure 6 we display for three different values of time , the value of @xmath287 as a function of @xmath288 for both the classical as well as for the semiclassical approximation .",
    "notice that the error so defined depends linearly on @xmath288 and the classical calculation lies always above the semiclassical one .",
    "figure 6 also shows explicitly that in both cases @xmath287 goes to zero as @xmath194 .",
    "we have also defined a _ breakdown _",
    "time in the following way : we fix a maximum value for the error @xmath289 and plot the time @xmath290 when this occurs for several values of @xmath167 in both cases , the classical and the semiclassical ( gaussian ) approximations . again , according to this measure we see that the gaussian approximation is systematically better , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is valid for longer times ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the form of the curve is the same for both approximations .",
    "the problem of the form of the curve for the breakdown time has been the subject of recent investigation @xcite .",
    "in the present contribution we have shown how a mean field expansion in the sense of nonrelativistic many body theories can be used to obtain quantum corrections to the classical limit .",
    "the unitary time evolution of a gaussian state is shown to contain the classical limit plus corrections coming from allowing the width of the wave packet to become an independent variable .",
    "we have discussed the connection between this approach and other approaches in the literature and applied it to the @xmath0 lipkin model .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the unitary quantum corrections showing that they give rise to chaotic behavior , which is essentially the mechanism through which the tunneling phenomenon can happen in this context .",
    "we have also shown that the quantum corrections systematically improve the results obtained in the classical limit .",
    "the question left unexplored in the present work is the effect of nonunitary contributions .",
    "we believe this is an important next step , _",
    "i.e. _ , including the time evolution of occupation probabilities in the dynamics which is rather natural in the present formalism . it would be interesting to cast these contributions in the form of diffusive and dissipative processes .",
    "in particular , as can be seen from the equations of motion , when @xmath291 , @xmath292 the centrifugal barrier will be time dependent , affecting thus in particular the tunneling rates .",
