    "moreover , being limited by energy and momentum conservation @xmath6  can not reach arbitrarily large values .",
    "in particular , these models implement a pp impact parameter dependence which explains the so called jet - pedestal effect in the underlying event of hard collisions @xcite .    the underlying event is conventionally defined as the region transverse to the leading jet or particle in an event , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the azimuthal distance to the leading object .",

    "two - particle azimuthal correlations represent a powerful tool to understand the origin of high - multiplicity pp collisions .",
    "such studies involve measuring the distributions of the relative azimuthal angle @xmath12 between pairs of particles : a `` trigger '' particle in a certain transverse momentum @xmath23-interval and an `` associated '' particle in a @xmath24-interval . in these correlations , the fragmentation products of parton - parton scatterings manifest themselves as characteristic near - side ( @xmath25 ) peak- and away - side ( @xmath26 ) ridge - structures .",
