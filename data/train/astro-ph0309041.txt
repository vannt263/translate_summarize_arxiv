    "it is becoming clear that a proper understanding of galaxy formation and evolution must address the role played by the supermassive black holes ( sbh ) now suspected to be present in most galaxy nuclei ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) and responsible for the agn phenomenon . in the local universe , the importance of the sbh ",
    "host - galaxy relationship has been highlighted recently by the tight correlation of sbh mass with the host bulge velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) and concentration index ( graham et al .  2001 ) .",
    "it is of great interest to probe the agn  host - galaxy relationship out to higher redshifts , where , for example , the strong evolution observed at the low end of the agn luminosity function by _ rosat _ deep x - ray surveys ( hasinger et al .",
    "1999 ; miyaji et al .",
    "2000 ) has been associated with an increased rate of galaxy interactions and distorted / irregular morphologies in the early universe ( lilly et al .",
    "1998 ; abraham et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the recent _ chandra x - ray observatory _",

    "these studies have also confirmed that the cosmic x - ray background is largely attributable to moderate - luminosity agn ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) at moderate to high redshifts ( @xmath6 ) , many with significant obscuration by the host galaxy .",
    "this underscores the desirability of studying the agn  host connection with samples detected at hard x - ray energies , where there is much less bias against the dust obscuration that segregates agn into type  1 ( unobscured ) and type  2 ( obscured ) in the standard unified model ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "although much has been learned from studies of agn and their hosts at low redshift , and from comparisons of the evolution of higher - luminosity agn and field galaxies at high redshifts , the fundamental question of whether nuclear activity drives galaxy evolution , or vice versa , can only be fully addressed by obtaining high - resolution multi - wavelength observations of _ typical _ agn _ and _ their hosts over a _ wide range _ of redshifts .",
    "the combination of _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and _ cxo _  deep imaging offers a unique opportunity to satisfy these requirements : the _ chandra _ deepest fields contain the requisite large , unbiased sample of distant low- to moderate - luminosity agn with the high positional accuracy ( @xmath7 ) necessary for unambiguous association with their faint host galaxies ; subsequent high - resolution _ hst _  images of these regions then permit the detailed investigation of their host galaxy morphologies and environments .    to this end",

    "again we found a @xmath10% fraction with unambiguous _",
    "_  counterparts , and the combined x - ray and optical properties of this expanded sample largely reinforced the conclusions of paper i : the optical counterparts to the x - ray sources are divided into two distinct populations , namely 1 )  an optically faint group with relatively blue colors , similar to the faint blue field galaxy population , and 2 )  an optically brighter group , including resolved galaxies with average colors significantly redder than the corresponding bright field galaxy population .",

    "this algorithm neglects the small - scale noise correlation introduced into the data by our drizzling procedure , but we expect the effect to be minimal ( see also casertano et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we implement the parameter fitting in idl , using as inputs : the data image section ; the associated rms noise image ; and the psf image .",
    "the fitting proceeds in two stages , starting with a downhill simplex optimization of @xmath73 based on the `` amoeba '' subroutine from numerical recipes ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) . in order to minimize our sensitivity to starting values in the optimization",

    "1992 ) .",
    "we extensively tested the fidelity of the model - fitting code with simulated galaxy images matched to the psf and noise properties of our data , with representative fluxes ( @xmath75@xmath76 counts : @xmath77 ) and scale lengths ( 310 pixels : 01505 ) , and spanning the full ranges of profile shape parameters .",
    "we found that the code performed very well at recovering @xmath61 and moderately well at recovering @xmath60 for simulated galaxies with @xmath78 counts ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "for example , the code typically recovered @xmath80 in simulated @xmath81 galaxies to within 10% over the full range of @xmath61 , and for @xmath82 models it typically returned @xmath83 upper limits of @xmath84% ( @xmath85 ) . for fainter simulated galaxies of @xmath75 counts ( @xmath86 ) ,",
    "the signal - to - noise became too poor for adequate model fits .",
    "we therefore restrict our discussion of the two - dimensional profile - fitting results to the @xmath3 galaxies in our sample , where in particular we have high confidence in the central point - source recovery .    to determine the uncertainty in the best - fit value for the central point - source flux @xmath80 , we first define the psf - weighted chi - square of the best - fit parameter set : @xmath87 . starting from the best - fit point - source flux @xmath88 , we step away from this value with increasing @xmath89 , at each step carrying out a downhill simplex minimization of all the parameters subject to the constraint @xmath90 .",

    "we have adopted this more conservative approach to estimating the errors on the point - source component because the @xmath93/pixel in the immediate vicinity of the galaxy core is often much larger than the mean @xmath93/pixel across the entire comparison region . if this procedure indicates that @xmath82 is not excluded at @xmath94 , we quote a @xmath83 upper - limit to the galaxy s point - source component in table [ tab : hst_cxo_pap3 ] .",
    "otherwise we quote @xmath88 with its @xmath95 errors .",
    "we measure an asymmetry index @xmath43 of all wfpc2 sources ( both x - ray counterparts and x - ray undetected field sources ) in the three fields following the prescription of conselice et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which we summarize here . for each source , we determine its half - light radius @xmath39 using sextractor .",
    "we then extract the square image section @xmath48 centered on the source with sides of length @xmath96 .",
    "we rotate @xmath48 by @xmath97 to obtain the comparison image @xmath98 .",
    "the asymmetry index is then calculated according to the formula @xmath99 where the summation is over individual pixels , and the minimization is over a fractional - pixel grid ( with spacing of 0.2 pixel , or 001 ) of possible centers of rotation .",
    "we determine the asymmetry zeropoint @xmath100 from a fixed large square region @xmath101 of blank sky on the particular chip where the source resides .",
    "because the background noise properties vary between pointings and between the wfs and the pc , we can not simply use a single @xmath102 for all sources .",
    "sources which happen to fall close to a chip edge , or happen to have a spurious companion very close in projection , will have artificially inflated asymmetry estimates in this prescription .",
    "we have modified the asymmetry index code ( in iraf , provided to us by c.  conselice ) to correct for the former bias by masking the regions along chip edges where the exposure map falls off .",
    "when a source s image section @xmath48 contains such masked pixels , we exclude those pixels ( and their @xmath97-rotated counterparts ) from the summation above .",
    "fortunately , this chip - edge asymmetry inflation affects only a small fraction of all sources ( e.g. , two of 37 _ cxo _",

    "non-_cxo _  sources .",
    "we do not attempt to correct the `` spurious - companion '' bias , because we do not know _ a priori _ if two neighboring sources are only close because of projection .",

    "we plot the asymmetries of all sources versus magnitude in figure [ magasymfig ] , denoting the _ cxo _  counterparts by large symbols keyed to morphological type as classified in paper  ii : e / s0 ( circles ) ; s / irr ( squares ) ; unresolved ( stars ) ; and indeterminate ( triangles ) .",

    "there is also some suggestion that the bluer - centered objects have a slightly higher @xmath118 on average than the flat - color and redder - centered objects .",
    "the correlation between higher @xmath118 and blue central color gradient is expected since the bluer - centered objects are probably all type  1 agn and are therefore detected at somewhat higher distances on average .",

    "having measured the asymmetry and concentration indices of all sources appearing in our three wfpc2 pointings (  [ asymconcsec ] ) , we can make statistical comparisons of these morphological indicators between the _ cxo_-detected and the _ cxo_-undetected sources .",

    "our finding that the brighter resolved cdfs sources , almost all at moderate redshifts @xmath1281 , have a strikingly similar asymmetry distribution to the @xmath3 field may be compared with earlier morphological studies of the _ local _ agn population .",

    ", corbin  ( 2000 ) concludes that minor mergers either have _ no _ role in the triggering of lower - luminosity agn , or that the agn manifests only in the late stages of the mergers  implying that the nuclei in his nearby sample have only been active within the last @xmath139  gyr .",
    "inasmuch as the hard x - ray sensitivity of the cdfs provides a near - complete census of both obscured and unobscured agn at @xmath140 down to modest luminosities , similar to the bjc00 sample , the cdfs counterparts unexceptional asymmetries and paucity of obvious merger candidates ( @xmath141 ; c.  conselice 2003 , private comm . )",

    "however we note that 8  corresponds to a narrow range of angular diameter distance , @xmath14365  kpc , over a broad redshift range @xmath144 in our adopted cosmology .",
    "this redshift range includes almost all the cdfs counterparts at @xmath3 , whose redshift survey is virtually complete ( szokoly et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , and presumably the majority of the @xmath3 field galaxies .",
    "if the @xmath3 galaxies were not clustered , an 8  radius would on average contain 1.1 such objects given their source density over the @xmath145  arcmin@xmath146 of our three wfpc2 fields .",

    "the cdfs counterparts show an enhancement in the fraction with a single near neighbor and a corresponding deficit of isolated systems ; the fraction with multiple companions is almost identical between the two populations . while it is obvious that the near - neighbor frequency histogram ( fig .",
    "[ nnfig ] ) shows greater discrepancy between the x - ray host and field populations than the asymmetry parameter , nonetheless the @xmath93 statistic between the two histograms gives only a modest rejection of the null hypothesis ( prob@xmath147 ) that the nearest - neighbor frequencies are consistent .",
    "larger samples are clearly needed to establish the significance of a bias against isolated cdfs sources ( see  [ concsec ] ) .",
    "as the current data do not support a significant enhancement in the fraction of cdfs sources with near neighbors , this reinforces our interpretation from the asymmetry analysis (  [ asymdisc ] ) that there is no strong association between low- to moderate - luminosity agn at moderate redshifts and recent / ongoing merger activity of the host galaxies .",
    "similar conclusions at low redshift have emerged from recent studies of the agn fractions among close pairs versus the field ( barton , geller , & kenyon  2000 ) , and of the companion fractions of agn versus non - agn ( schmitt  2001 ) .",

    "hst_-resolved cdfs counterparts , i.e.  those whose optical flux is not dominated by the central engine , one may still worry that their concentration indices may be biased by the presence of optical flux from the agn .",
    "indeed we have found several of the cdfs host galaxies to be best - fit with a nuclear point source comprising @xmath149% of the total flux ( fig .",
    "[ ptsrcfig ] ) .    in theory , our two - dimensional modeling could be used to refine the @xmath44 estimates by removing nuclear point - source bias .",
    "for example , one may consider computing @xmath44 from a galaxy image _ after _ subtracting the best - fit nuclear point source .",
    "the model psf does not precisely match the shape of the true psf , however , and scaled psf subtraction leaves relatively large - amplitude residuals in the host s central pixels which hamper @xmath44 estimation via sextractor .",
    "alternately , one may consider computing @xmath44 from a model galaxy image constructed from the other , non - point - source , parameters in the two - dimensional fit . in practice",
    "this approach also fails , as our simulations indicate the two - dimensional fitting robustly recovers the point - source flux but not the input bulge and disk shape parameters .",
    "furthermore , a proper comparison with the field control sample in either case would require extending the two - dimensional modeling and `` nuclear point - source correction '' to the whole population , which is beyond the scope of the current study .",
    "fortunately , our calculations below suggest that any enhancement of @xmath44 from nuclear point - source flux is at most a small fraction of the observed @xmath44 discrepancy ( fig .",
    "[ conccdffig ] ) between _ cxo _  hosts and field .",
    "the effect of added point - source flux to a galaxy s concentration index is not straightforward , since the near - gaussian _",
    "hst_psf is significantly less concentrated than an exponential or @xmath53 profile .",
    "small additions of nuclear flux will cause @xmath44 to rise as @xmath150 shrinks faster than @xmath151 , but when the point - source becomes sufficiently dominant the concentration will peak and then collapse to the lower @xmath44 of the psf .",
    "we have attempted to quantify this effect by creating a suite of model galaxies based on a fiducial galaxy profile typical of our @xmath3 cdfs counterparts : a psf - convolved , @xmath152 devaucouleurs profile with @xmath153  pixels ( 0.25 ) .",
    "we then steadily increase the flux fraction in the point - source nucleus , and measure @xmath44 as a function of the point - source fraction .",
    "the result is plotted in figure [ concbiasplot ] , where we see that the peak increase of @xmath44 is only @xmath139 . over the range corresponding to our measured point - source fractions ,",
    "the deviation is @xmath154 .",
    "this is only @xmath155 of the discrepancy seen in figure  [ conccdffig ] , from which we conclude that the agn host concentration bias is truly related to differences in the host galaxy structure , and not to the possibility of nuclear point - source flux contribution .",
    "graham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have found a tight correlation between sbh mass and host galaxy concentration index exists among the nearby galaxy samples which previously established the close correlation between sbh mass and host bulge velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt  2000 , gebhardt et al .",

    "our wfpc2 findings therefore suggest , for the first time , that the close linkage between sbh mass and host galaxy properties extends to the substantial look - back times ( @xmath157 ) typical of the @xmath3 cdfs x - ray sources .",
