    "thanks to the new breed of radioactive isotope beam ( rib ) facilities set up in the last years all over the world the study of exotic systems far away from the valley of stability has become one of the main topics in today s nuclear physics . on the neutron rich side , because neutrons do not carry electric charge , the dripline can extend far away from the valley of stability .",
    "many neutron rich regions have been the subject of detailed studies in recent years and just to give an example one should mention the regions around the magic neutron numbers n=20 and n=28 .",
    "these exotic systems show many new interesting features which deserve a careful study @xcite . among them , the weakening of the neutron magic numbers n=20 and n=28 in some nuclei is probably the most challenging to study .",
    "it was in the neutron rich region n @xmath1 20 where the breaking of a shell closure was first detected @xcite and related with a shape transition to prolate deformed shapes @xcite .",
    "ground state deformations in this region easily explain the anomalous isotope shift observed in @xcite as well as the decrease in the two neutron separation energy @xmath2 in and @xcite .",
    "a large deformation has also been inferred in the n=20 nucleus through the measurements of @xmath3 transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "in addition , the low excitation energy of the first @xmath4 excited state @xcite in and the ratio @xmath5 are consistent with the expectations for a rotational state .",
    "recently , evidence for a rotational band in has also been obtained @xcite .",
    "although indirect , another evidence for the deformed nature of the ground state comes from the strong ground state deformation of inferred from the large value of the @xmath6 transition probability measured @xcite in this nucleus and the @xmath7 ratio of 3.18 @xcite which is very close to the rotational limit .",
    "further evidence for deformed ground states in the neutron rich mg isotopes have also been obtained experimentally @xcite .",
    "in addition , the quadrupole collectivity in was experimentally studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , an extensive account of older experimental results can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the framework of the mean field approximation",
    "the ground state has been found to be spherical ( see for example @xcite ) but it has also been argued that dynamical correlations may play an important role in this and other nuclei of the region . in particular , the results presented in @xcite gave initial hints concerning the importance of the restoration of symmetries and configuration mixing in some of the exotic nuclei considered . from the shell model point of view , the large deformations around n=20 have been explained by invoking excitations of pairs of neutrons across the n=20 shell gap ( 2 @xmath8 configurations ) . in a small set of nuclei ( the _ island of inversion _ )",
    "the coexisting 2 @xmath8 intruder states actually fall below the normal 0 @xmath8 states and become the ground state configurations . in this way shell",
    "model calculations with different levels of complexity @xcite have been able to explain the increased quadrupole collectivity around n=20 .    the existence of anomalies in shell closures , as already found in nuclei with n @xmath1 20 , is one of the main features for the experimental and theoretical studies carried out up to now in the neutron rich nuclei with n@xmath9 28 .",
    "the @xmath10-unstable nuclei around have attracted particular interest since these nuclei play an important role in the nucleosynthesis process .",
    "the experimental study of the @xmath10-decay properties of ( n=28 ) indicated @xcite that this nucleus is deformed .",
    "this has been confirmed in subsequent intermediate energy coulomb excitation studies @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments on nuclei of this region @xcite suggest that is indeed a deformed nucleus but with strong shape coexistence making more challenging its theoretical description .",
    "the region n @xmath1 28 has been studied using the skyrme hartree - fock ( hf ) model and the relativistic mean field approximation ( rmf ) @xcite .",
    "these studies also showed the onset of deformation for some nuclei with n @xmath1 28 .",
    "surprisingly , in none of these mean field calculations the rotational energy correction has been considered in spite that it is known to be a key ingredient for a proper description of the energy landscape as a function of the quadrupole deformation . however , in the mean field calculations of @xcite with several parameterizations of the skyrme interaction , in the calculation reported in @xcite in the framework of the bohr hamiltonian method with the gogny interaction or in our recent study @xcite of the phenomenology of quadrupole collectivity around n=28 the rotational energy correction was explicitly taken into account either in an approximate way or exactly .",
    "the conclusions extracted from those calculations concerning the erosion of the shell closure at n=28 do not differ qualitatively ( but they do in the quantitative side ) from the ones extracted from the calculations without the rotational energy correction .",
    "this indicates that the n=28 shell closure can be more easily broken than the n=20 one ( see also @xcite ) . from the shell model point of view",
    "an erosion of the n=28 shell closure in the sulphur isotopes has also been found in calculations with the full @xmath11 shell for protons and the full @xmath12 shell for neutrons ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic study , in the nuclei , of the quadrupole deformation properties of the ground and excited states .",
    "this isotopic chain contains the three spherical magic numbers n=8 , n=20 and n=28 and therefore it is a good testing ground to examine both the systematic of deformation and the possible erosion of spherical shell closures .",
    "besides , most of the considered nuclei are examples where the mean field energy landscape as a function of quadrupole deformation shows prolate and oblate minima which are practically degenerate in energy .",
    "therefore , the correlation energies associated with the restoration of broken symmetries ( mainly the rotational symmetry ) and the collective quadrupole motion have to be considered at the same time . in the present study both effects are taken into account in the framework of the angular momentum projected generator coordinate method @xcite .",
    "the main reason to perform an exact angular momentum projection is that the usual approximations , like the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) , used to compute the rotational energy correction as well as the @xmath13 transition probabilities are not expected to work well @xcite at least for some of the nuclei considered in this study .",
    "we have used in our calculations the gogny interaction @xcite with the parameterization @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the use of the gogny interaction in this systematic study is justified not only by the fact that this interaction provides reasonable results for many nuclear properties all over the nuclear chart , but also by the good description of the phenomenology of quadrupole collectivity in the regions n @xmath1 20 and n @xmath1 28 obtained recently in the same framework as the one used in this study @xcite as well as in the context of the bohr collective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "as the results presented in this paper will show , this force also provides reasonable results for the systematic description of the phenomenology of quadrupole collectivity in the chain of magnesium isotopes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the theoretical formalisms used in the present paper .",
    "these formalisms are the angular momentum projection ( amp ) and the angular momentum projected generator coordinate method ( ampgcm ) @xcite with the axially symmetric quadrupole moment as generating coordinate .",
    "the angular momentum projection technique is presented in section 2.1 where also special attention is paid to the specific problems appearing in the case of a density dependent interaction like the gogny force . in section 2.2",
    "we present the simplified expressions corresponding to the results of 2.1 in the case of axially symmetric intrinsic wave functions .",
    "configuration mixing of angular momentum projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov states is presented in section 2.3 .",
    "there we also present the expressions to compute both transition probabilities and spectroscopic quadrupole moments ( for more details the reader is referred to appendix a ) .",
    "the results of our calculations for several magnesium isotopes are discussed in section 3 . in section 3.1",
    "we present the results for the underlying mean field studies . in section 3.2",
    "the topological changes introduced in the mean field potential energy surfaces due to the exact restoration of the rotational symmetry are presented and then the results of the angular momentum projected configuration mixing calculations are discussed and compared with the available experimental data and other theoretical calculations . finally section 4 is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "as the results of the next sections will show , the mean field approximation is just an starting point and additional correlations have to be incorporated in order to properly describe the considered nuclei .",
    "the small energy differences observed between the coexisting minima indicate that many body effects beyond the mean field , like the restoration of the rotational symmetry and/or quadrupole fluctuations , may change the conclusions extracted from the raw hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation .",
    "the restoration of the rotational symmetry leads to an energy gain ( the so called rotational energy correction ) which is proportional to the quadrupole deformation of the intrinsic state and ranges from zero ( spherical intrinsic state ) to a few mev for typical well deformed configurations in the region of the nuclear chart considered in this study .",
    "therefore , the consideration of this effect might play a key role for a more qualitative and quantitative description of the nuclei we are interested here .",
    "in addition , it is very important to consider the effect of quadrupole mixing @xcite ) in those cases where the angular momentum projected potential energy surfaces show important topological changes compared with the corresponding mean field surfaces .",
    "the theoretical background for the restoration of rotational symmetry is treated extensively in the literature ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and also very good books and papers concerning the treatment of correlations beyond mean field in the framework of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) are available ( see , for example , refs .",
    "thus we are not going to dwell on these details here . in spite of this",
    "we believe that it is useful to present a short outlook of our procedure to carry out both angular momentum and configuration mixing in the case of a density dependent interaction like the gogny force .",
    "in addition , the issue of which density dependence has to be used in these calculations beyond mean field will be discussed in detail and strong arguments in favor of the prescription used will be given .",
    "let us consider a set of mean field states @xmath15 depending on the parameters @xmath16 which define the corresponding mean field configurations .",
    "from this set we can build another set of states where the rotational symmetry is restored @xcite    @xmath17    the operator @xmath18 is the angular momentum projection operator @xcite given by    @xmath19    with @xmath20 representing the set of the three euler angles @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the well known wigner function @xcite and @xmath23 is the rotation operator .",
    "the energy @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25    the above procedure is based on the assumption that the hamiltonian is rotational invariant and therefore the intrinsic energy @xmath26 is independent of the orientation of the intrinsic wave function @xmath27 , that is @xmath28    however , when dealing with density dependent ( dd ) forces the above assumption apparently breaks down as , in general , the density dependent term is not rotational invariant .",
    "this apparent paradox can be solved if density dependent hamiltonians are thought not as genuine hamiltonians but rather as devices to get an elaborated energy functional of the density . with this point of view the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rotinv ] ) has to be treated as @xmath29\\hat{r}(\\omega ) |\\varphi ( \\vec{q})\\rangle\\ ] ] where the interaction depends on the rotated density @xmath30 with the density operator defined in the usual way @xmath31 before proving that eq .",
    "( [ rotinv ] ) holds for density dependent interactions let us present some basic results .",
    "first , we introduce the @xmath32 unitary rotation matrix @xmath33 that appears when eigenstates @xmath34 of the position operator are rotated @xmath35 this is the same matrix that appears when vector operators ( like the position operator ) are rotated @xmath36 now we have to consider the role played by the density operator .",
    "its mean value ( or overlap ) appears in the density dependent part of the hamiltonian and therefore the  parameter \" @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ densop ] ) has to be treated as the position operators in that case . as a consequence the action of the rotation operator on @xmath37 has to be considered @xmath38 as well as its action on the internal coordinates @xmath39 @xmath40 with these results we have for the rotated density of eq .",

    "( [ rotdens1 ] ) whereas the second is the result of applying eq .",
    "( [ rotdens2 ] ) .",
    "the result thus obtained shows that even for density dependent forces eq .",
    "( [ rotinv ] ) holds .    in order to evaluate the projected energy we need to know the hamiltonian overlaps @xmath42 . for density independent and rotational invariant interactions",
    "the hamiltonian overlap is simply given by @xmath43 .",
    "for density dependent interactions this quantity is not well defined and therefore we have to look for a prescription for the density dependent term .",
    "the most popular prescription so far is to use the density @xmath44 in the density dependent part of the interaction .",
    "several arguments to show the credibility of this prescription have been given .",
    "for example , for those skyrme forces , with a linear dependence in the density , that can be cast as a three body force the hamiltonian overlap can be computed without ambiguity and the resulting density dependent term depends on the density of eq .",
    "( [ hamdenj ] ) .",
    "arguments based on the extended wick theorem ( the fundamental tool to compute the overlap of operators between different product wave functions ) are also very popular . apart from the previous arguments , it is mandatory for the prescription to be used that it fulfills the following two requirements : first",

    "the main reason why we can not consider so large @xmath131 in the present study is obvious : the enormous amount ( typically of the order of one thousand ) of angular momentum projected hamiltonian overlaps to be computed in the configuration mixing calculation make the problem intractable . in ( using the @xmath80 range @xmath132 , the mesh @xmath133 and 16 points in the angular momentum projection )",

    "it is worth to remark that besides the technical difficulties in the configuration mixing calculation , our force is a finite range force and its mathematical structure leads to very complicated matrix elements whose evaluation is very time consuming .",
    "on the other hand , as the absolute value of the binding energy does not affect very much the collective motion ( it is only affected by the shape of the energy landscape ) we can select a reasonable value of @xmath131 for which the energy landscape is well converged ( i.e. its shape remains almost unchanged in the regions of physical significance when the value of @xmath131 is increased ) . as we will see in the next paragraph",

    "the nucleus , with its oblate intrinsic state at @xmath179 is the exception in all the mg isotopes studied . as it was mentioned before ,",

    "our results are also consistent with the predictions of the quantum monte carlo shell model @xcite and the shell model @xcite . our results , although not as good as the sm or qmcsm ones , are very satisfactory considering that the parameters of the force have not been fitted to the region and/or the physics of quadrupole collectivity and also that no effective charges have been used in our calculations of the transition probabilities .",
    "the calculated excitation energies for the @xmath4 and @xmath206 states are plotted in panels c ) and d ) .",
    "they reproduce quite well the experimental isotopic trend and are again consistent with the theoretical trends predicted by both the shell model @xcite and the quantum monte carlo shell model @xcite . in most cases , however , our values come too high as compared with the experiment . in our previous works",
    "@xcite we also noticed the same behavior in some n @xmath1 20 and n @xmath1 28 nuclei ( our predictions were too high as compared with the experiment ) .",
    "probably a proper treatment of some missing correlations will give the quenching factors we need for a much better agreement with the experiment .",
    "although it is very difficult to assert before hand what are the missing correlations , the mixing of different @xmath259 values with a full triaxial angular momentum projection and a beyond mean field treatment of the dynamical pairing fluctuations can be important ingredients for a more realistic description of the nuclei studied in this paper .",
    "another source of discrepancy could be related to the fact that ours is a calculation of the projection after variation ( pav ) type instead of the more complete projection before the variation ( pbv ) .",
    "having all this in mind and the free parameter character of our calculation we conclude that our results for the excitation energies of the @xmath4 and @xmath206 states show a rather satisfactory agreement with the available experimental and are consistent with other theoretical predictions .",
    "with the aim to describe the phenomenology of quadrupole deformation in light nuclei we have performed calculations with the gogny force and in the framework of beyond mean field theories for the nuclei .",
    "first of all , the results show the fundamental role played by the angular momentum projection for a proper description of the physics under study .",
    "the effect of projection in all the physical observables is so big that it can not be overlooked as it has been common practice in many previous calculations .",
    "in addition , we also find that the effect of configuration mixing is in most cases rather relevant . from our results",
    "we conclude that for the magnesium isotopes the n=8 shell closure is preserved whereas for n=20 and n=28 deformed ground states appear in the calculations .",
    "the three isotopes from to the drip line nucleus are predicted to be prolate deformed in their ground states . concerning the excitation energies and @xmath13 transition probabilities of the low - lying excited states we obtain a reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "the agreement is not as good as the one obtained with other approaches like the shell model or the quantum monte carlo shell model .",
    "the reason for that probably lies in the fact that our treatment of the problem , although it contains the most important ingredients , is not as refined and complete as the one of the sm and/or the qmcsm .",
    "in addition , the interaction used has not been fitted to this specific region of the periodic table .",
    "the later could be consider as a drawback of our calculations but we think it is the other way around and in fact is a manifestation of the strong predicting power of the gogny interaction .",
    "it is rather satisfactory to obtain the results presented in this paper with an interaction that is also able to reproduce , for instance , the fission barrier heights of .    finally , the consistency of the prescription used for the density dependent term of the interaction in the present calculations beyond mean field has been discussed in great detail .",
    "this work has been supported in part by dgi , ministerio de ciencia y tecnologa , spain , under project bfm2001 - 0184 .",
    "in this appendix we present the basic formulas for the computation of angular momentum projected transition probabilities in the framework of the ampgcm .",
    "the starting point is the transformation property of the multipole operators @xmath260 under rotations                        in the present work we are interested in the calculation of transition probabilities for axially symmetric hfb states labelled by the quadrupole deformation @xmath80 .",
    "taking advantage of the axial symmetry of the intrinsic wave function as well as the selfconsistent symmetry @xmath66 we can simplify the above expressions as follows .",
    "first we have @xmath269 that leads to @xmath270 applying this result to the expression of eq .",
    "( [ red_qlambda ] ) we obtain @xmath271 where we have , in the last line , reduced the integration interval to half the original one .",
