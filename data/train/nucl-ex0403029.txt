    "<S> we present results on identified particle production in p+p , d+au and au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev at mid - rapidity measured by the phenix experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality and flavor dependence of the cronin effect in d+au collisions is measured . </S>",
    "<S> the cronin effect for the protons in d+au is larger than that for the pions , but not large enough to account for the `` anomalous '' proton to pion ratio in central au+au collisions .    in the search for the quark gluon plasma at the relativistic heavy ion collider </S>",
    "<S> it was discovered that hadron production at high transverse momentum ( @xmath1gev/@xmath2 ) is suppressed in central au+au collisions  @xcite compared to nucleon - nucleon collisions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the yields of @xmath3 and @xmath4 near 2gev/@xmath2 in central events  @xcite are comparable to the yield of pions ( @xmath5 ) , in contrast to the proton - to - pion ratios of @xmath6 in p+p  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> novel mechanisms of particle production in the environment of hot and dense nuclear matter were proposed  @xcite to explain this phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the properties of this environment is not straightforward though and requires control over the interplay between many competing nuclear effects  @xcite that influence the particle spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these include shadowing , enhanced production at moderate @xmath7 , and energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of paramount importance to perform a control experiment to quantify these competing mechanisms and distinguish effects of the surrounding cold nuclear matter ( initial state effects ) from those originating from highly excited nuclear matter ( final state effects ) .    consequently , rhic collided d+au at @xmath8200  gev , and also provided p+p collisions for a baseline measurement . </S>",
    "<S> phenix measured identified particle spectra , yields , ratios , and nuclear modification factors from these data . </S>",
    "<S> the d+au experiment , besides serving as a comparison measurement for relativistic heavy ion collisions , acquires a significance of its own . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality dependence of particle production in d+au collisions can provide detailed information on the microscopic origin of the cronin effect and possibly provide insights on the baryon enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> also , protons exhibit a larger cronin effect than pions and kaons at lower energies  @xcite and at rhic  @xcite while no theoretical calculations can account for the species dependence of the effect .        the data were collected in run02 for au+au and p+p collisions at @xmath9  gev ; in run03 , d+au collisions at the same energy were studied . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed presentation of the au+au analysis can be found in  @xcite . in the following we discuss the analysis of the p+p and d+au data . </S>",
    "<S> minimum bias events with vertex position along the beam axis within @xmath10  30 cm were triggered by the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) located at @xmath11  =  3.0 - 3.9 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum bias trigger accepts ( 88 @xmath12 4% ) of all inelastic d+au collisions and ( 51.6 @xmath12 9.8% ) of all p+p inelastic collisions that satisfy the vertex condition . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 1.4 @xmath13 10@xmath14 d+au events and 1.35 @xmath13 10@xmath14 p+p events were analyzed .    </S>",
    "<S> charged particles are tracked using the central arm spectrometers . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrometer on the east side of the phenix detector ( east arm ) contains the following subsystems used in this analysis : drift chamber ( dc ) , pad chamber ( pc1 ) and time - of - flight ( tof ) . </S>",
    "<S> identified charged particles are measured using a portion of the east arm spectrometer covering pseudo - rapidity @xmath15 and @xmath16 in azimuthal angle . </S>",
    "<S> particle identification is based on particle mass calculated from the momentum measured by the dc and the velocity obtained from the time - of - flight and the path length along the trajectory .    </S>",
    "<S> collision centrality is selected in d+au using the south ( au - going side ) bbc ( bbcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the bbcs signal is proportional to the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath17 ) in the au nucleus , and that the hits in the bbcs are uncorrelated to each other . using a glauber simulation of d+au collisions the distribution of @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> is generated for different impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for a given centrality the charge distribution of the bbcs is described by a negative binomial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are assumed to be proportional to @xmath17 , and fitted to reproduce the data , yielding a bbcs charge response function . </S>",
    "<S> we define 4 centrality classes in d+au collisions with @xmath18=@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .     for pions and protons in d+au and au+au collisions.,width=10 ]    the proton to pion ratio from p+p , d+au and au+au is shown in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the protons are not feed - down corrected in this ratio since this correction was not available for the d+au and p+p data . for feed - down corrected @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra in au+au see  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 ratio in d+au is very similar to the peripheral au+au while the p+p ratio is somewhat lower . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the high value of the @xmath23 ratio in central au+au collisions can only be attributed to the hot and dense nuclear matter created in this class of collisions while the baseline measurement is much lower .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : figure2 ] shows the central to peripheral ratio in d+au and au+au for @xmath18 scaled @xmath24 spectra of @xmath25 and pions . </S>",
    "<S> we define the central to peripheral ratio @xmath26 as : @xmath27 although the protons have a larger cronin effect than the pions in d+au , on the order of 20 - 25% , this phenomenon can not account for the approximately factor of 3 enhancement of the protons with respect to the pions in the au+au case . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the enhancement of the protons relative to the pions in central au+au is not just due to the species - dependent cronin effect . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon production mechanism must depend on the produced medium ; even if it is already present in d+au , the effect is necessarily much smaller @xcite .     for pions and protons.,width=10 ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : figure3 ] shows @xmath28 , the nuclear modification factor using the p+p spectrum as a reference , for pions and protons in two momentum bins . </S>",
    "<S> the modification factors are plotted as a function of the number of collisions suffered by the deuteron participant nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the lower momentum bin is in the @xmath7 region where @xmath28 is less than 1.0 , and the dependence on the number of collisions is minimal . in the higher @xmath7 bin </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath28 shows a steady increase with the number of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of increase is larger for baryons than for mesons .    </S>",
    "<S> traditional explanations of the cronin effect involve multiple soft scattering of incoming partons that lead to an enhancement at intermediate @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> there are various theoretical models  @xcite of the multiple scattering , predicting somewhat different dependence upon the number of scattering centers . </S>",
    "<S> recently , hwa and collaborators  @xcite have shown an alternative explanation of the cronin effect , attributed to the recombination of shower quarks with those from the medium , even in d+au collisions .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the centrality and species dependence of identified particle spectra in all 3 collision systems studied at rhic to date . </S>",
    "<S> the proton to pion ratio in d+au is similar to the peripheral au+au while the corresponding ratio in p+p is somewhat lower . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear modification factor in d+au for protons shows a larger cronin effect than that for pions but not large enough to account for the abundance of protons in central au+au collisions . </S>"
