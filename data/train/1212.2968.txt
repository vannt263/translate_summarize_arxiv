    "this suggestion and the consideration of relativistic quantum statistics refined the bbn model @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite indicated that the early universes was hot and dense , and bbn theory was confirmed .",

    "the baryon to photon ratio , @xmath0 , is one of the important parameters characterizing the bbn model .",
    "recently , we have constrained @xmath0 from observations of cmb @xcite and tested various models of bbn using the constrained value of @xmath0 as an input .",
    "effects of a primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) on bbn have been studied @xcite .",
    "the pmf directly affects rates of weak reactions @xcite , and also the cosmic expansion rate through the pmf energy density . results of bbn could , therefore , be different from that for the case with no pmf @xcite .",

    "a power law ( pl ) spectrum is one of the most familiar distributions for the energy densities of various physical phenomenon on cosmological scales , including the pmf(e.g . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus many researchers have been studying the effect of the pmf with the pl spectrum on various physical processes in the early universe @xcite and have tried constraining parameters of such pmfs .    in this article , providing the pl as the distribution function of the pmf ( pl - pmf ) , we report effects of the pl - pmf on primordial abundances of light elements up to li as a function of the baryon to photon ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the energy density of the pl - pmf is dependent on the field strength , the pl index , and the maximum and minimum scales of the pmfs at the generation epochs .",

    "we modify the kawano s bbn code @xcite , taking into consideration the pmf effects , and use the updated reaction rates with the recommendations of the jina reaclib database v1.0 @xcite as adopted in ref .",
    "we use @xmath5 s as the neutron lifetime @xcite , which is estimated with an improved measurement @xcite .",

    "the uncertainties in the calculated abundances originating from an uncertainty in the neutron lifetime are much smaller than both uncertainties in observationally induced abundances and changes in calculated abundances caused by the magnetic field .",

    "we assume that the main components of the universe are photon , neutrino , baryon and cold dark matter ( cdm ) , they are the ideal fluid , and the universe expands adiabatically .    we describe a rate of reaction between some particles as @xmath24 .",
    "the time scale of the reaction is then @xmath25 .",
    "when the reaction time scale becomes larger than the age of the universe , i.e. , @xmath23 , the reaction effectively stops in the universe . whether a reaction is operative or not is determined by the following condition , i.e. , @xmath26 since the final nuclear abundances of bbn depend on when the respective reactions become ineffective , the energy densities of the universe influence the abundances of the elements produced in bbn .",
    "we will explain how the pl - pmf energy density affects the cosmic expansion and bbn .",
    "in the early universe including the bbn epoch , we can assume that statistically average motions of fluids are negligibly small .",
    "in this case , from maxwell s equations and ohm s law , we derive the induction equation @xcite @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the magnetic diffusivity , which is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electric conductivity and @xmath31 is the electrical resistance @xcite as follow , @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the mass of the electron , @xmath34 is the electron charge , @xmath35 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath36 is the number density of the photon , @xmath37 is the number density of the electron , and @xmath0 is the baryon to photon ratio .",

    "therefore , the magnetic field is hard to be generated on the scale @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic field on a scale much larger than @xmath44 is hard to dissipate in the universe by time @xmath40 , and the magnetic field is `` frozen - in '' the dominant fluids @xcite . in this article",
    ", we are interested in magnetic fields which survive until the end of bbn . in the epoch during which the electron positron annihilation has been completed ( @xmath45mev ) ,",
    "the cutoff scale for pmf generations , @xmath44 for @xmath46 , is @xmath47 the comoving scale @xmath48 is @xmath49 and the comoving wave number @xmath50 is @xmath51 here we use @xmath52 .",
    "thus we will report results of the effects on bbn from the pmf with a comoving wave number less than @xmath53 .",
    "the pl spectrum is one of the most familiar forms for distributions of the energy densities including that of the pmf @xcite .",

    "many researchers have been studying the effect of the pmf with the pl spectrum on various physical processes in the early universe @xcite , and have tried to constrain parameters of such pmfs .",
    "we then assume that the pmfs with the pl spectrum are statistically homogeneous , isotropic , and random , as assumed in previous studies , and we research their effects on bbn .",
    "after a magnetic field is generated , the total energy density originating from that of the magnetic field is conserved , even if part of the magnetic field energy is transferred to other physical degrees of freedom ( e.g. kinetic or / and thermal energies of dominant fluids or the gravitational wave ) in the adiabatic universe .",
    "the cosmic expansion depends on the total energy density in the universe .",
    "therefore , when we consider the effect of the pmf energy density on the cosmic expansion , it is reasonable to define the total energy density originating from the pmf at its generational epoch .",
