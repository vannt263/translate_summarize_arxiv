    "<S> the ability of neutrino factory for constraining cpt violation is enhanced with increase in energy for normal neutrino mass hierarchy(nh ) . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino factory with the exposure time of 500 kt - yr will be able to capture cpt violation with @xmath5 gev at 3@xmath6 level for nh and for ih with @xmath7 gev at 3@xmath6 level .    </S>",
