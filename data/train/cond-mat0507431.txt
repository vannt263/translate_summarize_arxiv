    "scattering of an electron off a magnetic impurity embedded in a conductor is known to be anomalously strong  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the anomaly is rooted in the degeneracy of the localized spin states .",
    "this degeneracy , being removed by a weak exchange interaction with the itinerant electrons in a metal , gives rise to the strong scattering of electrons with low energy ",

    "perturbation theory in the exchange interaction constant @xmath10 is singular .",
    "the second - order contribution in @xmath10 to the scattering amplitude diverges logarithmically  @xcite if the electron energy @xmath0 ( measured from the fermi level ) and temperature @xmath4 are approaching zero .",
    "it is important to notice that the logarithmically divergent contribution to the amplitude corresponds to an elastic process .",
    "indeed , this contribution comes from the change of state of _ one _ electron ; states of all other itinerant electrons are the same in the beginning and end of the scattering process .",
    "therefore , the energies of the electron before and after the scattering is unchanged .",
    "the divergence noticed by kondo is not unique to the second order of the perturbation theory .",
    "its higher orders ( @xmath11 ) also contain divergent terms of the type @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is some ultraviolet energy cut - off , whose value depends on the specific model ; @xmath15 .",

    "it is clearly seen  @xcite , however , that the scattering is not purely elastic at @xmath22 . at @xmath23 , for example , the inelastic contribution to the electron scattering cross - section scales as @xmath24 , and becomes comparable to the elastic part at @xmath25 .",

    "the measurable characteristics , such as the contribution to the susceptibility or resistivity due to magnetic impurities depend smoothly on temperature . similarly , the electron scattering off a magnetic impurity , which is deeply inelastic at @xmath26 , must have some inelastic component at any energy @xmath0 . in this paper",

    "the separation of the electron scattering cross - section in the kondo effect into elastic and inelastic parts at @xmath32 was not addressed for decades , as it does not affect the routinely measured quantity , the resistivity .",
    "the anomalously fast electron energy relaxation in some mesoscopic metallic wires  @xcite , which was discovered in the last decade , prompted a search for relaxation mechanisms driven by impurities with internal degrees of freedom .",

    ". the removal of degeneracy of the localized spin states by the exchange interaction results in an anomaly of the electron - electron scattering cross - section at small energy transfers  @xcite ; the collision of two electrons with energies @xmath33 leads to a re - distribution of the energies between the two particles , @xmath34 , and has cross - section @xmath35 in the lowest - order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 dependence of @xmath37 allowed the experimental observations  @xcite to be explained qualitatively .",
