    "we present and analyze results of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 measurements of stars collected from different bibliographic sources and personal communications , as well as our own determinations obtained at special astrophysical observatory ( russian academy of sciences ) , see bychkov ( 2008 ) and bychkov et al .",

    "1 - 4 present sample rotational magnetic phase curves ( mpc ) for stars of various types and the distribution of the available mpc over spectral classes .",
    "for each star in the catalog the average magnetic phase curve was obtained by the least squares fitting of a sine wave or a double wave to observed @xmath0 points .",
    "this is the same method as that used in the first version of the catalog ( bychkov et al .",
    "in general the second version of the catalog is mostly very similar to the first version .",
    "recently the amount of available data sharply increased partly due to the flow of new high - precision observational data obtained with the least squares deconvolution method ( lsd ) described by donati et al .",
    "these circumstances caused discovery of variable longitudinal magnetic fields in a number of stars of different types and more precise determination of mpc s in magnetic stars already known .",
    "1 shows the distribution of stars with known mpc among spectral types . as the figure shows , the bulk of stars for which mpc s are known is concentrated in the spectral region around type a. this is due to the large contribution from ap / bp stars .",
    "table 1 shows the types of stars for which mpc s were determined .",
    "precise specification of types of stars sometimes is not possible .",
    "for example , hd96446 consists of a he - r and @xmath1 cep stars , hd97048 consists of tts ( t tau ) and ae / be herbig objects , flaring dt vir consists of uv cet + rs cvn types ( flare + rs cvn type stars ) .",

    "6 - 7 depict distribution of the coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 of double sine waves best fitted to the magnetic @xmath0 time series observed in these stars . in the first version of the catalog ( bychkov et al .",
    "2005 ) we pointed to the unusually large bias of @xmath4 towards negative values .",
    "we attributed the effect to the low statistics of total 19 double wave stars in the old catalog .",
    "actually we have 45 stars in the sample , over twice more than before .",
    "now the distribution of @xmath4 is more symmetric around the value of zero and only a slight imbalance towards the negative values of the average @xmath4 still remains there .    only in one exceptional star hd37776 ,",
    "the mpc is best described by the triple sinusoid .",
    "catalog of the magnetic rotational phase curves mpc primarily represents a review and synthesis of the longitudinal magnetic field measurements of stars of various classes , accumulated up to now .",
    "principal reason of the longitudinal field variability is rotation of a star with its magnetic field frozen into ionized gas and seen at different aspect angles .",
    "magnetic field itself evolves relatively rapidly , which can be observed in cool red dwarfs ( flare stars ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the strongly differential rotation of those stars , which causes steady generation of local magnetic fields , which sometimes annihilate one another causing flares . on the contrary ,",
    "sometimes local fields add up to change strength and configuration of the global magnetic field in time scales from months to years .",
    "this causes changes of parameters and shape of the magnetic phase curve .    in case of stars of other types",
    ", global magnetic fields do not evolve rapidly .",
    "nevertheless , there are apparent indications that in some stars there are signatures of rapid evolution of the global magnetic fields .",
    "we collected and uniformly processed all available observations on the variability of longitudinal magnetic fields of stars in the unified form , which allows one for a statistical analysis of the data and for testing and verification of various theoretical models .",
    "the catalog will be also useful for the development of observational programs .",
    "we believe , that the accumulated observational data will be used to refine rotational periods and parameters of many stars included in this catalog .",
