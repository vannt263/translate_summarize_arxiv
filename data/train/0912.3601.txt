    "now , we take a large rectangle @xmath6 in @xmath1 , decide that one side is the `` left side '' , and accordingly name the other sides the right side , the top and the bottom of @xmath6 .",

    "informally , we ask : how does the maximal flow between the top and the bottom behave when @xmath6 gets larger and larger ?",
    "this question was first considered in @xcite , where a law of large numbers and large deviation estimates where proved , but only for `` straight '' rectangles @xmath6 , i.e. with sides parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "let us mention that lower large deviations are of surface order , i.e. of the order of the width of @xmath6 whereas upper large deviations are of volume order , i.e. of the order of the area of @xmath6 . in a previous work , @xcite , the authors extended the law of large numbers of @xcite to rectangles @xmath6 with arbitrary orientation .",
