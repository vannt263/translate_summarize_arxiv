    "the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) matter subject to a strong magnetic field has been a hot topic of intense investigation @xcite . the strange quark matter ( sqm )",
    "is regarded as a ground state composed of deconfined @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 quarks @xcite .",
    "the new state is expected to be searched in extreme conditions of high density and/or high temperature .",
    "in addition to these environments , the sqm is argued to be subject to strong magnetic fields .",
    "the extreme strong magnetic field theoretically seems beyond the scope of the conventional condensed matter , and its origin remains not very clear until now .",
    "however , it has been recently proposed to be produced in noncentral collision experiments in the relativistic heavy ion collider and the large hadron collider on the one hand @xcite , or to be naturally existing in the core of pulsars on the other hand .",
    "the large magnetic fields in nature are normally associated with astrophysical objects , where the density is much higher than the nuclear saturation .",
    "the typical strength could be the order of @xmath9 g on the surface of pulsars @xcite .",
    "some magnetars can have even larger magnetic fields , reaching the surface value as large as @xmath10 g @xcite . by comparing the magnetic and gravitational energies ,",
    "the physical upper limit to the total neutron star is of the order @xmath11 g. for self - bound quark stars , the limit could go higher @xcite .",
    "maximum strengths of @xmath12 g in the interior of stars are proposed by an application of the viral theorem @xcite . in the lhc / cern energy",
    ", it is possible to produce a field as large as @xmath13 g @xcite .    the special properties of qcd matter are widely affected by strong magnetic fields in many branches , such as the ( inverse ) magnetic catalysis @xcite , the anisotropies @xcite , the magnetic oscillations @xcite , the magnetization @xcite , the phase diagram with a critical end point @xcite etc .",
    "the magnetic field larger than @xmath14 g can obviously change the spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "all of these are essentially resulted due to the landau levels arrangement of charged particles in magnetic fields . in principle",
    ", not only quark masses will change in the medium , but also the coupling constant will run in the medium , such as the magnetic - field - dependent coupling and magnetic - temperature - dependent coupling @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the dressed masses of three flavors are very different , which leads to a flavor - dependent fraction in quark matter and strangelets @xcite .",
    "similarly , the threshold condition and the quantum numbers of the landau level of quarks are also flavor dependent .",
    "generally , @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks dominate the bulk matter at low densities . as the density increases ,",
    "strange flavor begins to take part in its landau levels .",
    "therefore , the phase was argued to be divided into three regions such as the chirally broken phase ( b - phase ) , the massive phase ( c - phase ) , and the chirally restored phase ( a - phase ) in previous work @xcite , where the detailed locations of the two - flavor landau levels were shown in the @xmath3-@xmath4 phase panel .",
    "however , at a proper density , the @xmath2 quark can not participate in the previous discussion because its dressed mass is larger than the chemical potential , thus the @xmath2 quark could not occupy its lowest landau level ( lll ) . in this work , we will show the critical density for the appearance of @xmath2 quarks by considering the two kinds of coupling interactions , the conventional coupling constant and the magnetic - field - dependent running coupling respectively .",
    "the main aim of this work is to perform a detailed analysis of the landau levels with and without the @xmath2 quark depending on the magnetic field strength .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , a brief review of the nambu@xmath15jona - lasinio ( njl ) model description of cold sqm in a strong magnetic field is provided .",

    "[ sec : result ] , the numerical results and discussion are given at common chemical potential and under the @xmath16 equilibrium respectively . a detailed analysis of the occupied landau levels with respect to the magnetic field is given .",

    ", the interaction coupling constant between quarks should be solved by the rg equation , or can be phenomenological expressed in an effective potential @xcite . in the infrared region at low energy , the dynamical gluon mass represents the confinement feature of qcd @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of a strong magnetic field , the gluon mass becomes large together with a decreasing of the interaction constant , which leads to a damping of the chiral condensation . for sufficiently strong magnetic fields @xmath59",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath60 is proposed to be related to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "motivated by the work of miransky and shovkovy @xcite , the similar ansatz of the magnetic - field - dependent coupling constant is introduced in the su(3 ) njl models @xcite .",

    "only two - flavor light quarks fill in their landau levels , where the @xmath2 quark is excluded because of its dressed mass larger than @xmath3 .",
    ", width=264,height=264 ]    in a strong magnetic field with a certain direction , quarks wrap around the magnetic field and the orbital motion will be ruled by the landau energy level . because dressed masses of quarks are different , the occupations of the discretized landau level are flavor dependent . at a proper density ,",
    "the dynamical masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks are smaller than their chemical potential and have a real distribution in the landau levels .",
    "but the dynamical mass of the @xmath2 quark is much heavier than that of the @xmath0/@xmath1 quark , and thus it can not occur until the critical chemical potential above its dynamical mass is reached . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the critical chemical potential is shown by the solid line for the conventional constant coupling @xmath70 , and by the dashed line for the running coupling @xmath69 respectively . when the chemical potential is above the line , the @xmath2 quarks have real distributions in the landau levels . in the region below the line , there are only two - flavor quarks in their landau levels , and the @xmath2 quark is excluded because of its dressed mass larger than @xmath3 .",
    "it can be found that at much higher field strengths , the regions of three quark matter in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane become wider .",
    "furthermore , the region is much wider with the running coupling @xmath69 than the constant coupling @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that the running coupling interaction could broaden the region of three - flavor quark matter . in other words ,",
    "the strange quark can exist at lower density with the running coupling than the constant coupling case .",
    ".[tab : level ] the quantum number of landau levels occupied by quarks for the fixed chemical potential @xmath71 mev at several magnetic fields .",
    "the number @xmath72 means the lll .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is well known that the chemical potential dominates the energy spectrum of the particle without the magnetic field .",

    "it can be found that the much higher magnetic field can accommodate quarks in lower levels .",
    "furthermore , the onset of the @xmath2 quark can be seen in its lll until the field reaches @xmath73 g. while at lower magnetic field , the quantum number of filled landau levels is larger and the quantization effects are washed out .     and @xmath1 quarks change with the strong magnetic field .",
    "the solid line and dashed line are , respectively , for the constant coupling @xmath70 and the running coupling @xmath69 .",
    ", width=264,height=264 ]        before the onset of the @xmath2 quark , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks dominate the quark matter .",
    "because of the identity @xmath74 , the level number of the @xmath1 quarks is exactly 2 times the level number of the @xmath0 quark in order to meet the global charge neutrality . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the landau levels of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks with the same chemical potential @xmath3 are shown in the range of the magnetic field ( @xmath75 g ) .",
    "we use the logarithm to label both the vertical axis and the horizonal axis .",
    "then the landau level number as functions of the magnetic field vary linearly , which is very near the red dotted line ( @xmath76 ) for @xmath1 quarks .",
    "consequently , we can easily find that the @xmath0/@xmath1 quark landau level number @xmath43 and the magnetic field @xmath4 nearly satisfy a simple inverse proportional relation , @xmath77 at the coupling @xmath70 , where the scale is @xmath6 g for @xmath1 quarks , which is 2 times @xmath7 of @xmath0 quarks .",
    "the experiential formula indicates the constraint on the strong magnetic field . in strong magnetic fields ,",
    "charged fermions acquire infrared phase space proportional to @xmath78 . as the magnetic field strength increases",
    ", quarks are suppressed to the lower levels . at the same time the degeneracy factor of each energy level is enlarged to @xmath79 .",
    "when the magnetic field increases up to the order of @xmath80 or so , almost all three flavors are concentrated on the lll .",
    "the lll would make the qcd matter more interesting , where the quarks are independent on the magnetic field with zero transverse energy @xcite . after taking into account the running coupling @xmath69 ( marked by dashed lines ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the line deviates from the straight line at the field strength larger than @xmath11 g. therefore the running coupling can move the location of the lll to a field strength slightly lower than @xmath80 .",
    "it can be expected that at the same magnetic field , the sqm can be more easily realized at the running coupling than the conventional coupling .",
    "the strong magnetic field drastically affects the structural properties and the thermodynamics .",
    "as far as we know , the chemical potential increases together with the number density .",
    "but for the sqm under a strong magnetic field , the variation relation between the chemical potential and the number density is not always monotonous . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the quark chemical potential changes with the baryon number density at several values of the magnetic fields .",
    "the curves from top to down denote the increasing of the magnetic field . at a low density",
    "less than @xmath81 @xmath82 , the effect of the magnetic field strength is very important , where the degeneracy contribution from the magnetic field is much larger than the fermion momentum .",
    "so at the same density , the chemical potentials are very different for different magnetic fields . furthermore",
    ", a small number of quarks under the influence of the strong fields can easily produce the oscillation behavior of the chemical potential . while in the high density region , the fermion momentum increases and the oscillation behavior can not be easily found anymore .     as the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is shown under the @xmath16 equilibrium condition .",
    ", width=264,height=264 ]    in realistic situations for neutron stars , the chemical potentials for different flavors will be different and related by the physical constraints in a neutron star .",
    "so we can do the calculation by assuming the three - flavor quark matter is in @xmath16 equilibrium .",
    "now there are three dynamical masses and two independent chemical potentials , which can be determined by the three gap equations ( [ eq : gapsu3 ] ) , the baryon number conservation , and the neutral charge condition , @xmath83     and @xmath1 quarks versus the magnetic field as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are shown under the @xmath16 equilibrium .",
    ", width=264,height=264 ]    under the @xmath16 equilibrium condition @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ fig40 ] , we can get the similar result as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , namely , the critical potential @xmath85 for the onset of @xmath2 quark is about @xmath86 mev with the coupling @xmath70 . but at much higher magnetic field",
    ", the value of @xmath85 has an apparent drop due to the contribution of electrons .    before the onset of the @xmath2 quarks ,",
    "the landau level number is approximately inverse proportional to the magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we can also find the similar inverse proportional relation between the maximum landau quantum number and the magnetic field . under the @xmath16 equilibrium",
    ", it should be changed as @xmath87 we can see that the contribution of electrons can hardly change the relation of @xmath1 quarks .",
    "but the value of @xmath88 is decreased to @xmath89 g because its chemical potential is reduced to @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , the charge neutral condition can still be reached due to the reduction of the @xmath1 quark density in addition to the contribution of electrons . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the corresponding contribution of the electron density is shown on the left axis .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath91 is shown on the right axis .",
    "we can see that the @xmath91 will decrease as the magnetic field increases . on the contrary , due to the degeneracy factor @xmath79 , the density will keep increasing monotonously at the higher magnetic field .",
    "in this paper we have studied the energy level of the sqm in a strong magnetic field within the su(3 ) njl model .",
    "the critical chemical potential was shown for the onset of @xmath2 quarks .",
    "we found that the running coupling scheme can broaden the existing region of the three - flavor quarks in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane .",
    "as the density increases , the quarks in the high level participate in the system . just before the onset of @xmath2 quarks , we found that the maximum quantum number of the @xmath92 landau level is directly dependent on the field strength through a simple inverse proportional relation @xmath5 .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is certainly flavor dependent . in particular , the value @xmath93 of @xmath1 quarks is approximately 2 times @xmath7 of @xmath0 quarks . it should be pointed that the chemical potential does not monotonously vary as the density increases . at high densities ,",
    "the chemical potential keeps increasing with the density .",
    "but at low density , the chemical potential could be a decreasing function of the baryon number density , otherwise , the oscillation behavior becomes clear .",
    "the corresponding work can be done under the @xmath16 equilibrium .",
    "the running coupling can still broaden the window of three - flavor matter .",
    "because the common chemical potential relation is changed to @xmath84 , the inverse proportional relation should be written as @xmath94 , where @xmath88 is no longer half of @xmath95 .",
    "these results will be helpful in realistic situations for neutron stars .",
    "the magnitude of magnetic field in compact stars decreases from the core to the surface of stars .",
    "the study of the relation of magnetic field and landau level is helpful to know the components of stars for a given radius .",
    "the quarks in the lll make the qcd more interesting and illustrate the nonperturbative effects , which is further enhanced by the strong magnetic field .",
    "we give the condition of the magnetic field larger than @xmath96 , under which all three - flavor quarks are lying in the llls .",
    "we expect that all of these considerations would be helpful to the theoretical investigation and future experiments searching for the sqm under an extremely strong magnet field .",
