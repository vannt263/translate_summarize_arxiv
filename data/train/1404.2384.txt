    "the scattering of electromagnetic ( em ) waves by small particles is a common optical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "according to the size of scatters , it can be classified into rayleigh ( for scatterer sizes much smaller than the wavelength ) and mie scattering ( for scatterer sizes comparable to the wavelength ) .",
    "the most known example of rayleigh scattering is the blue color of the sky wherein the scattering intensity by the gas molecules in the atmosphere varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength .",
    "the scattering of em waves depends not only on the scatterer size and geometry but also on the em properties of scatters .",
    "in addition to conventional dielectric ones , scatterers made of emerging artificial materials have received broad interest in recent years and many extraordinary scattering properties have been revealed @xcite .",
    "for instance , the scattering of an object composed of metamaterial in the far field could be reduced to zero ( cloaking ) @xcite , or even transformed to other objects of different appearance @xcite . for a subwavelength nanorod consisting of multiple concentric layers of dielectric and plasmonic materials ,",
    "its scattering cross - section can far exceed the single - channel limit , leading to superscattering @xcite . for particles with magnetic responses ,",
    "many unusual em scattering properties such as zero forward scattering has been proposed and confirmed experimentally @xcite . even being one - atom thick ,",
    "arrays of graphene nano - disks could nearly completely absorb infrared light at certain resonant wavelengths @xcite .    as an emerging phase in condensed matter physics , topological insulators ( tis ) has been of great interest in recent years @xcite due to their exotic properties . in the bulk ,",
    "tis resemble ordinary insulators possessing a bulk energy gap .",
    "however , their surface states are gapless ( metallic ) and protected topologically by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "ti materials have been theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed in several material systems @xcite . in additional to exotic electronic and transport properties ,",
    "tis show many unusual em properties @xcite .",
    "for instance , a point charge atop the surface of a ti can induce an image magnetic monopole @xcite . in a ti thin film ,",
    "there exist a giant magneto - optical kerr effect and an interesting faraday effect with a universal rotation angle defined by the fine structure constant @xcite . from the kerr and faraday angles in a ti thick film",
    ", one can even determine the half - quantized hall conductance of the two ti surfaces independently without knowing the material details @xcite .",
    "on ti surfaces , the surface plasmon modes can even couple to spin waves , forming interesting hybridized spin - plasmon modes @xcite . in two ti plates , casimir forces",
    "could even be switched to be repulsive @xcite although they are usually attractive in two ordinary dielectric plates .",
    "all these interesting phenomena stem from the topological magneto - electric ( tme ) effect arising from the unusual em response in tis @xcite .    in this letter , we study theoretically the scattering of em waves by circular ti cylinders , particularly in the rayleigh scattering limit",
    ". unusual scattering properties due to the tme effect are revealed . in three - dimensional tis ,",
    "the em response can be described by a lagrangian consisting of a conventional maxwell term and an additional term related to the tme effect @xcite , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electric and magnetic fields , respectively ; @xmath3 is the fine structure constant ; and @xmath4 with @xmath5 being an integer is a quantized angular variable to characterize the tme effect , known as the axion angle in particle physics @xcite . by breaking the time - reversal symmetry at the surface ( e.g. , coating a ti with a thin ferromagnetic layer ) ,",
    "a surface energy gap will open up so that the value of @xmath6 can be specified definitely as discussed in refs . .",
    "indeed , @xmath6 gives a half - quantized hall conductance @xmath7 which can be viewed as the origin of the tme effect @xcite . in tis",
    ", the propagation of em waves can still be described by conventional maxwell s equations . however , owing to the presence of the tme effect the constitutive relations in tis should be modified as @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the electric displacement and the magnetic field strength , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability , and @xmath14 is a quantized quantity in units of the fine structure constant .",
    "note that the effective description of the modified constitutive relations of tis applies only for the photon energy @xmath15 much smaller than both the bulk and surface energy gaps , where @xmath16 is the angular frequency of em waves . compared to conventional media such as anisotropic ones @xcite , the scattering of em waves by a ti cylinder differs in an additional contribution resulting from the tme effect , basically a surface and topological effect that gives rise to many unique and novel quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "the system under study is schematically shown in fig .",
    "a circular ti cylinder with a radius @xmath17 is placed along the @xmath18 axis . in this study , we focus on transverse electric ( te ) waves ( with the magnetic field along the ti cylinder ) which are incident perpendicularly to the ti cylinder .",
    "transverse magnetic ( tm ) incident waves ( with the electric field along the ti cylinder ) can be discussed similarly .",
    "the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability of the ti are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and those of the background are @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the axion angle of the ti is @xmath4 while the background takes a trivial axion angle @xmath21 for simplicity . to break the time - reversal symmetry on the surface ,",
    "the ti cylinder is coated with an ultrathin ferromagnetic layer which plays no role in the scattering since its thickness is much smaller than both the radius of the ti cylinder and the wavelength of em waves considered @xcite .    based on the standard multipole expansion theory @xcite",
    ", we can solve the scattering problem of em waves by a circular ti cylinder with the modified constitutive relations and the conventional boundary conditions at the boundary between the ti cylinder and the background .",
    "the scattering coefficients \\{@xmath22 } and \\{@xmath23 } , related respectively to the electric and magnetic multipoles of order @xmath24 , can be obtained . with these scattering coefficients ,",
    "scattering properties of the ti cylinder can be obtained accordingly .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , similar to those in ordinary dielectric cylinders @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that \\{@xmath22 } and \\{@xmath23 } are polarization - dependent . in other words , there exist two independent sets of the scattering coefficients , \\{@xmath27 ,  @xmath28 } and \\{@xmath29 ,  @xmath30}. for an incident wave with an arbitrary polarization , its scattering properties can be discussed since it can be decomposed as a linear combination of te and tm waves .    compared with ordinary dielectric cylinders , extra contributions resulting from the tme effect appear in both \\{@xmath22 } and \\{@xmath23 } , leading to many unusual scattering properties .",
    "for example , for an ordinary dielectric cylinder a te incident wave can not excite the magnetic multipoles because of @xmath31 ( not valid for @xmath30 in general ) .",
    "however , for a ti cylinder @xmath28 does not vanish in general , implying that the magnetic multipoles can be excited .",
    "the underlying physics lies in the tme effect whereby an electric ( magnetic ) field can induce a magnetic ( electric ) polarization . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the scattering coefficients of a ti cylinder for te incident waves as a function of the size parameter @xmath32 is shown .",
    "in general , the electric multipoles give much larger contributions to the scattering than the magnetic multipoles . in the rayleigh scattering limit ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 ) , for te incident waves",
    "it can be shown that only the following scattering coefficients have order of @xmath36 ,    @xmath37    all other scattering coefficients have order of @xmath38 or higher , and can be hence neglected in rayleigh scattering . in other words , in rayleigh scattering only the electric dipole , and magnetic monopole and dipole play roles for te incident waves . in the mie scattering regime ( @xmath39 ) , however , both the electric and magnetic multipoles will contribute to the scattering .",
    "interestingly , at certain frequencies resonant peaks appear , known as mie resonances @xcite , corresponding to the resonant excitations of the electric or magnetic multipoles .",
    "for example , the peak at @xmath40 in @xmath41 corresponds to the resonant excitation of the electric monopole while the peak at @xmath42 in @xmath43 implies the resonant excitation of the magnetic monopole .",
    "in addition to resonant peaks , there exist sharp dips in @xmath44 showing a _ anti - resonance _ behavior .",
    "the underlying physics is that at the dips a te incident wave can not induce a transverse magnetic field , leading to @xmath31 , i.e. , the absence of the tme effect at the dips . for tm incident waves on the other side",
    ", it can be shown that only the scattering coefficients @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 have the @xmath49 term , and all other coefficients are in order @xmath38 or higher , namely , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "different from te incident waves , a tm incident wave can excite the electric monopole in rayleigh scattering .    to obtain the fields of scattered waves in the far field ,",
    "an amplitude scattering matrix @xmath54 is usually introduced which relates the electric field of scattered waves to that of incident waves @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the components of the electric field parallel and perpendicular to the ti cylinder , respectively ; and @xmath58 is the radial distance from the center of the ti cylinder in the @xmath59-@xmath60 plane . from the definitions in fig .",

    "it vanishes at @xmath82 . by analyzing the origin",
    ", the element has a dominant contribution from @xmath83 , namely , the electric dipole .",
    "in contrast , the element @xmath84 , which is linearly proportional to @xmath85 in rayleigh scattering , shows a rather weak dependence on @xmath77 since there are two contributions from @xmath86 and @xmath87 , associated with the magnetic monopole and dipole , respectively .    from the amplitude scattering matrix ,",
    "information on scattering properties can be inferred .",
    "for instance , for a te incident wave the scattered waves in general are still dominantly te - polarized for the scattering angle away from @xmath88 , although there is a very small rotation of the polarization due to the tme effect . this is because @xmath84 is much smaller than @xmath78 except for @xmath76 in the vicinity of @xmath89 . around @xmath88 ,",
    "the polarization of the scattered waves undergoes a drastic change , and the scattered wave becomes purely tm - polarized at @xmath88 .",
    "this is a strong manifestation of the tme effect . for a tm incident wave ,",
    "however , the scattered wave is always dominantly tm - polarized even at @xmath88 .",
    "this is why in this study we focus on te rather than tm incident waves . from the scattering matrix , the measure of the tme effect",
    "is associated with the ratio @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) for te ( tm ) incident waves .",
    "note that @xmath92 is much larger than both @xmath78 and @xmath93 for any @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath91 , basically a manifestation of the tme effect , is more than an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath90 which is related to te incident waves .",
