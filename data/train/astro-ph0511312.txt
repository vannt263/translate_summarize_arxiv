    "the presence of shocks in accretion flows is a relevant fact in the theory of accretion discs .",
    "shocks are a very efficient mechanism to produce high energy emission of radiation and to induce strong acceleration of particles .",
    "spiral shocks in accretion disks in binary systems have been studied since long time , theoretically by spruit @xcite , chakrabarti @xcite and with both 2d and 3d numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore there is increasing observational evidence of their significant role in determining the accretion of gas in binary systems @xcite .",
    "however the strength of this kind of shocks is usually weak .",
    "a different scenario for shock production has been proposed by chakrabarti @xcite .",
    "it has been widely tested with numerical simulations @xcite . in this view ,",
    "an axisymmetric flow of gas , rotating with an angular velocity less than keplerian ( we will call it `` sub - keplerian '' flow ) , and with small viscosity , can produce a steady shock .",
    "this fact is mainly due to the deceleration of the radial fall and consequent heating of the gas close to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "although the origin of such flows seems unclear there are arguments to support the hypothesis that they really exist . in galactic nuclei",
    "the ambient gas feeding the central black hole may be quite well symmetric and with small rotation as shown by observations @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , taking into account also the role of the viscosity , a detailed study of the requirements for their origin from a keplerian disk has been produced @xcite .",
    "these flows may explain very well the two frequencies in the qpo phenomenon in galactic black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "so even if their direct proof of existence is still pending , we think it is useful to study their properties and characteristics",
    ".    in any case it seems to us that the phenomenon , despite of its basic physical straightforwardness , has not been adequately considered .",
    "maybe some `` unconscious '' questions are raised against their effective existence : 1 ) these shocks appear when the flow has well defined parameters , derived from the analytical treatment .",
    "2 ) in the case of non ideal gas ( i.e. if a real cooling , an heating or conduction are included ) the analytical treatment is very difficult .",
    "3 ) even in the simple ideal gas case , the standard procedure @xcite to derive a solution is rather complicated : one has to compute the sonic point location and then compute the boundary conditions on derivatives of the radial speed , sound speed etc . itself , leading to cumbersome formulae .",
    "4 ) at the end of the whole process the analytical solution is numerical and specific for the set of the chosen parameters .",
    "so no simple general formula , like the shakura- sunyaev disk structure formulae , is available .",
    "another doubt is that the parameter space seems to be limited or too compelling . roughly speaking",
    ", people might say that the sources of gas do not know the boundary conditions at the sonic point or at infinity , they spread out their gas as they like .",
    "so , for example , in bound systems , the total energy will be negative and , up to now , only positive energy solutions have been discussed and simulated . even standard adaf models ( see @xcite and references therein ) , that are similar to the mentioned sub - keplerian flows , require positive energies to fit observational data .",
    "so what about negative energy flows ? here , we explain that , even in this case , there are solutions admitting permanent shocks .",
    "obviously this does not mean that in every sub - keplerian flow there is a standing shock at work .",
    "but when the physical parameters of the accretion ( essentially the rotation amount and the thermal energy content ) are appropriate , then the shock process occurs and produces the relevant phenomena described in previous references .",
    "the arguments of the paper are given as follows : in section 2 we revise the general accretion formulae for ideal gas with negative energy , in section 3 we present the results of numerical simulations and in section 4 we make our final discussion .",
    "to explain the shock formation , let us resume the very basic physical ingredients of the phenomenon .",
    "we assume that an axisymmetric flow of an inviscid gas is falling from very large distance onto a black hole and has reached a steady state regime .",
    "we will adopt the paczyski & wiita potential @xcite to mimic the general relativistic physics .",
    "the basic physical effect can be easily understood in terms of `` classical '' physics and it is well known that the paczyski & wiita force reproduces many relativistic effects with high accuracy . as we said in the introduction , to obtain the steady state solution we may integrate the differential equations for mass , momentum and energy conservations . in this case one",
    "has to start the space integration from the sonic point as explained in the work by @xcite .",
    "however in the case of inviscid flow it is easy to find an algebraic implicit solution , since ( in this case ) the total energy is conserved .",
    "the bernoulli theorem is valid and it can be exploited to close the system of equations and to find the solutions . for the 2d case ( with real z extension of the disk )",
    "we assume that the gas falls down in a condition of vertical equilibrium , with essentially zero vertical speed .",
    "the mass conservation equation is given by : @xmath0    where h is the half thickness of the disk .",
    "+ the vertical equilibrium hypothesis gives the well known expression for the half disk thickness : @xmath1    we could use a more accurate formula , but the results are essentially unchanged while the formulae are more complicated .    according to the bernoulli theorem",
    "the energy equation is given by : @xmath2    we will look for isentropic solutions and then we will see how to connect solutions with different entropies by shocks . for a flow with constant entropy @xmath3 and with specific heat at constant volume",
    "@xmath4 we may exploit the adiabatic relation :    @xmath5    that allows us to eliminate the density @xmath6 from the equations and to use the sound speed .",
    "so we have two unknown quantities @xmath7 , @xmath8 and two equations . resolving for @xmath8 from the bernoulli relation , using the radial mach number @xmath9 , and putting all terms into the continuity equation",
    ", we have the following implicit solution for the mach number : @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the mach function which depends only on the @xmath12 values , given by : @xmath13 ^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 .",
    "this function ( we name it the `` mach '' function ) has a maximum at @xmath15 , whose value is @xmath16    @xmath17 is function only of @xmath18 ; it is given by : @xmath19 ^{{\\frac { \\gamma}{\\gamma-1 } } } \\left ( r - r_{{g } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath20 .",
    "if the e value is positive this @xmath21 function may have two minima .",
    "the inner minimum appears when the @xmath22 value increases .",
    "when the total energy of the gas is negative we expect the system to be bound and therefore the solutions describing gas inflow into the black hole should not extend to infinity .",
    "now the @xmath21 function goes asymptotically to zero at a maximum radius and may have a relative minimum , at the radial position @xmath23 , close to the black hole if the angular momentum is large enough .",
    "figure 1 shows the a function for @xmath24 and different e values ( -0.00001 , -0.00003 , -0.00009 , -0.00027 ) ; higher lines correspond to larger @xmath25 values ( smaller absolute values ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the a function for the same energy @xmath26 and different , increasing , angular momentum values ( 1.67 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) ; higher lines correspond to lower @xmath22 values .",
    "both figures are drawn with @xmath30 and @xmath18 starting from @xmath31 to avoid the singularity at @xmath32 .",
    "for the same @xmath3 value and with @xmath33 we have the value @xmath34 .",
    "the radius @xmath35 at which @xmath21 goes to zero can be found analytically ; it depends only on e and @xmath22 , not on the @xmath36 of the gas .    since the product of the mach function @xmath11 and the @xmath21 function must be constant along the flow and",
    "since the mach function has a single maximum , then the minimum of @xmath21 at @xmath23 must be coincident with the maximum of @xmath11 .    imposing @xmath37 we obtain the solutions for @xmath12 .",
    "starting from the value @xmath38 we may obtain a new variety of solutions just solving for m the implicit equation @xmath39 .",
    "the factor @xmath40 scales the entropy of the flow .",
    "decreasing the value of @xmath41 we obtain families of solutions with the mach number @xmath12 shifted to larger values .",
    "for any supersonic solution @xmath42 , by using the hugoniot relation we may calculate the post shock mach value if a shock at a generic radius value @xmath18 occurred :    @xmath43    a standing shock can occur in the solution at @xmath44 if the values @xmath45 and @xmath46 are equal :    @xmath47    among the solutions with different @xmath40 values ( i.e. with different entropy values ) we will find the ones that can be connected by a shock jump with the subsonic branch .",
    "figure 3 shows the solutions for the mach number with @xmath48 , @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "the inner curve corresponds to @xmath49 , the larger one to @xmath50 .",
    "it is clear that the solutions can reach a maximum radius @xmath51 : they do not extend to infinity .",
    "for this case the shock is at @xmath52 .",
    "we report here the results of simulations performed using a smoothed particles hydrodynamic ( sph ) code in cylindrical coordinates developed by the authors .",
    "the sph formulae have been reported in previous publications @xcite .",
    "we stress here that a very accurate conservation of the angular momentum of the flow is an essential condition to obtain the shock solutions . for the numerical simulations we use dimensionless quantities .",
    "we adopt the speed of light as reference speed and the gravitational radius of a schwarzschild black hole @xmath53 as reference length .",
    "the comparison of simulation data with 2d analytical solutions requires some care . in the analytical treatment we assumed vertical equilibrium , but",
    "numerical simulations allow the gas motion in the vertical direction .",
    "therefore it is quite reasonable that the shocks , in the simulations , will not be exactly coincident with the theoretical predicted positions .",
    "we add , as comment , that we made simulations also with a fictitious damping acting only on the @xmath54 speed .",
    "the vertically damped simulations show a shock position in better agreement with theory .",
    "we present here the data coming from the simulation of a 2d case with the parameters used to obtain figure 3 .",
    "this case has the following parameters : @xmath26 , @xmath24 .",
    "the shock is predicted to be at @xmath52 .",
    "we chose to inject matter at @xmath55 . with this parameters the radial speed and the sound speed at @xmath56",
    "are @xmath57 , @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the spatial resolution of the sph particle is @xmath59 .",
    "the steady state particle number is @xmath60 .",
    "figure 4 shows the particle distribution in the upper half of the domain .",
    "the shock of the simulation is at @xmath61 .",
    "taking into account our previous remarks we may say that the shock position of the 2d simulation is in good agreement with the theory .",
    "we also report in figure 5 the mach value versus the radial distance of a 1d simulation .",
    "the physical parameters for the 1d simulation are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; the numerical parameters are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in this case , since there is no vertical motion , the agreement between theory and simulation must be exact , and effectively this occurs . for clarity , in the figure we plotted the theoretical mach value plus a small shift(@xmath69 ) .",
    "the shock is at the predicted position of @xmath70 .",
    "the whole shape of the curve profile is very well reproduced .",
    "note that the 1d solution is obtained in the same way of the 2d case , but the functions @xmath21 and @xmath11 are different . @xcite .",
    "with our analysis we reinforce the view that the existence of permanent shocks around black holes is an important aspect of the physics of accretion flows .",
    "it has been suggested that the qpo oscillations of the x - ray luminosity of galactic black hole candidates may arise from shock oscillations @xcite.jets of out - flowing matter may arise also from the high energetic post shock gas driven by radiation @xcite .",
    "these shocks produce around the central object a bulge of hot gas comptonizing the low energy thermal emission from a cold keplerian disk .",
    "we remark that shocks produce the hot corona in a quite natural way , while the corona outcome or the adaf solutions originating from keplerian disks have been shown by molteni et al .",
    "to be very unlikely @xcite .",
    "we stress that these flows are essentially axisymmetric .",
    "so this situation is different from the one in which the gas flow , in a binary system , is captured from the wind originated by the normal star .",
    "steady shocks of this kind can not be produced in this case since the flow has low angular momentum , but has _ non - axisymmetric _ configuration .",
    "obviously a crucial point is the question of the origin of such symmetric sub - keplerian flows .",
    "it seems to us that this problem is not critical for black holes in the centers of galaxies or agn , since in this case the star environment is nearly spherically symmetric and with low global rotation @xcite . in the case of black holes in binary systems",
    "we suggest that accretion may occur not only from the inner lagrangian point , but also by a small amount of ambient gas , possessing low rotation , in the potential well of the binary .",
    "time dependent 3d numerical simulations @xcite and recent observations support this hypothesis , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore it was suggested by carrol @xcite that the poynting - roberston effect can be efficient also to drive matter from keplerian disks even in accretion on white dwarfs . in the case of accretion on weakly magnetized neutron stars",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if the luminosity of the star is @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the eddington luminosity ) a substantial fraction of the accreting matter can lose its angular momentum .",
    "we also think that , for the binary black hole case , the disk self - illumination may produce similar effect decreasing the angular momentum of the outer layers of the disks .",
    "this process would be similar to the accretion driven by radiation suggested by ballantyne @xcite to occur in neutron star luminosity bursts .",
    "we add a trivial consideration : even if the inflow parameters do not correspond to the exact analytical ones , but are close to them , steady shocks may be still formed ."
