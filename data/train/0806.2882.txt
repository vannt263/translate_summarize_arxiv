    "most of the satellites of the four giant planets in the solar system can be divided into two groups , usually called the regular and irregular satellites .",
    "regular satellites orbit close to the planet ( within @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is the hill radius , where @xmath10 is the semi - major axis of the planet orbit and @xmath11 with @xmath12 the planet mass . ] ) , and move on nearly circular , prograde orbits that lie close to the planetary equator .",
    "irregular satellites are found at distances @xmath13 , with large orbital eccentricities and inclinations , on both prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "an alternative division between regular and irregular satellites is given by the critical semi - major axis ( e.g. , goldreich 1966 ; burns 1986 ) , @xmath14 ; those with @xmath15 are classified as irregular satellites . here",
    "@xmath16 is the planet s second zonal harmonic coefficient ( augmented by any contribution from the inner regular satellites ) and @xmath17 is the planet s radius .",
    "this critical radius marks the location where the precession of the satellite s orbital plane is dominated by the sun rather than by the planet s oblateness .",
    "the current number ratios of irregular to regular satellites are @xmath18 for jupiter , @xmath19 for saturn , @xmath20 for uranus , and @xmath21 for neptune ( e.g. , jewitt & haghighipour 2007 ) .",
    "the regular satellites are likely to have formed within a circumplanetary disk of gas and solid bodies .",
    "the kinematic differences between regular and irregular satellites suggest that the latter must have formed through a quite different mechanism , most likely capture from the circumstellar disk ( for a recent review , see jewitt & haghighipour 2007 ) .",
    "the search for irregular satellites of the giant planets has been fruitful in recent years , owing mainly to modern high - sensitivity , large - scale ccds ( e.g. , gladman et al .",

    "; sheppard & jewitt 2003 ; sheppard et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "up to 2007 , 106 irregular satellites of the giant planets had been discovered , compared to 53 regular satellites .",
    "two features stand out in the distributions of orbital parameters of these irregular satellites .",
    "first , retrograde irregular satellites extend to larger semi - major axes than prograde ones ( @xmath22 compared to @xmath23 ) ; second , satellites with orbital inclination in the range @xmath24 relative to the ecliptic are absent .",
    "a number of authors have shown that these features can be explained reasonably well by the requirement that the satellite orbits be stable .",
    "hnon ( 1969 , 1970 ) studied the planar circular restricted three - body problem in hill s ( 1886 ) approximation , where the mass ratio @xmath25 while the radii of interest shrink to zero as @xmath26 .",
    "he showed that prograde satellite orbits are stable up to a mean distance from the planet @xmath23 , while retrograde satellite orbits can be stable at much larger distances from the planet .",
    "thus it is not surprising that retrograde satellites are found at larger distances than prograde ones .",
    "hamilton & krivov ( 1997 ) studied the dynamics of distant satellites of asteroids in heliocentric orbits using a `` generalized tisserand constant '' and , among other conclusions , confirmed that retrograde orbits are more stable than prograde ones .",
    "carruba et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used a combination of analytic arguments and numerical integrations to show that high - inclination orbits inside the hill sphere exhibit large eccentricity oscillations ( kozai oscillations ; kozai 1962 ) due to secular solar perturbations .",
    "they found that orbits with inclinations ( relative to the planetary orbital plane ) between @xmath27 and @xmath28 are generally unstable , thus explaining the absence of irregular satellites on high - inclination orbits .",
    "nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2003 ) performed detailed orbital integrations of the four giant planets plus a grid of test - particle satellites for intervals of @xmath29@xmath30 yr .",
    "they confirmed that retrograde satellites can be stable at larger radii than prograde ones , and that highly inclined orbits are unstable .",
    "they argued that the largest semi - major axes at which satellites of the four giant planets could survive for times comparable to the lifetime of the solar system were @xmath3 for retrograde satellites and @xmath23 for prograde ones , and that these upper limits were achieved only for nearly circular orbits close to the plane of the ecliptic .",
    "other authors have examined the possibility that stable satellite orbits exist with mean distance from the planet @xmath31 . in the planetocentric frame ,",
    "the dominant force on such satellites is due to the sun , rather than the planet .",
    "nevertheless , the satellite remains close to the planet because it is in a 1:1 resonance in the sense that its heliocentric mean longitude librates around that of the planet ; the resulting orbit relative to the planet is a retrograde ellipse with axis ratio 2:1 , the short axis pointing towards the sun , and synodic period equal to the planet s orbital period .",
    "the analytical theory of such orbits is described by jackson ( 1913 ) , lidov & vashkovyak ( 1994a , b ) , mikkola & innanen ( 1997 ) , namouni ( 1999 ) , mikkola et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and others .",
    "hnon s ( 1970 ) numerical analysis of hill s approximation to the planar circular restricted three - body problem suggests that stable retrograde satellites can exist at arbitrarily large distance from the planet . benest ( 1971 )",
    "confirmed that stable retrograde orbits at large distances persist in the elliptic restricted three - body problem , where the mass ratio and eccentricity were chosen to match those of jupiter .",
    "wiegert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) demonstrated that retrograde satellites of uranus and neptune could be stable for up to @xmath0 yr at distances up to @xmath8 , suggesting that primordial objects of this type could still exist in the solar system although none are currently known .    despite the number and quality of these investigations , there are several unanswered questions that lead us to revisit the problem of orbital stability of satellites at large distances from the host planet .",
    "( i ) wiegert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found stable satellite orbits beyond the hill radius only for uranus and neptune , not jupiter or saturn .",
    "what is the reason for this difference ?",
    "the possibilities include differences in the planetary masses and orbital eccentricities , or different perturbations from neighboring planets .",
    "( ii ) wiegert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) explored orbits outside the hill radius , while nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2003 ) explored orbits inside the hill radius ( indeed , in the former paper the integrations were terminated when the particles entered the hill sphere of radius @xmath1 around the planet , while in the latter paper the integrations were terminated when the particles exited the hill sphere ) . are there stable satellite orbits that cross the hill sphere ?",
    "( iii ) as we shall describe further in  [ sec : method ] , the grids of initial conditions used by nesvorn et al .  and wiegert et al .",
    "do not provide a complete exploration of the phase space in which stable satellite orbits exist .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to map out the entire stability region in phase space  both inside and outside the hill sphere  in which satellite orbits that can survive around the four giant planets for times comparable to the age of the solar system ( our main integrations last for up to 100 myr ) .",
    "we describe our setup in  [ sec : method ] , and present the results in  [ sec : result ] .",
    "we conclude and discuss our results in  [ sec : con ] .    following fabrycky ( 2008 )",
    ", we shall define a `` satellite '' of a planet to be a small body whose distance from the planet never exceeds the semi - major axis of the planet , @xmath10 .",
    "this definition excludes bodies on trojan orbits around the triangular lagrange points , bodies on horseshoe orbits , and objects such as asteroid 2003 yn107 ( connors et al .",
    "2004 ) , which oscillates between a horseshoe orbit and an orbit centered on earth .",
    "this definition seems simple and reasonable to us , but other definitions are common in the literature .",
    "many authors define `` satellite '' to be an object that always remains within the hill sphere of the planet or whose jacobi constant constrains it to remain within the last closed zero - velocity surface around the planet .",
    "benest ( 1971 ) defines a satellite to be a body whose heliocentric orbital frequency is the same as the planet s , but whose synodic frequency around the planet is non - zero .",
    "wiegert et al .",
    "use the term `` quasi - satellite '' for an object that remains outside the hill sphere but whose heliocentric longitude difference from the planet never exceeds @xmath32 and regularly passes through zero .",
    "however , the term `` quasi - satellite '' is confusing because it is also used for objects such as 2003 yn107 that spend part of their time on horseshoe orbits and thus are only temporarily satellites in our sense .",
    "although all of our results are based on direct numerical integrations of the n - body problem ( sun , one or four giant planets , plus a test particle orbiting one planet ) , we shall find it useful to interpret our results in terms of the coordinates and notation used by hnon ( 1970 ) in the exploration of satellite orbits in hill s approximation .      when studying satellite motions near a planet ( @xmath33 ) it is conventional to employ a _",
    "non - rotating _ planetocentric coordinate system , which we denote as @xmath34 .",
    "however , in hill s approximation to the circular restricted three - body problem , it is more convenient to use a _ rotating _",
    "planetocentric coordinate system @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are scaled coordinates in the rotating frame in which the planet is at the origin , the @xmath36 axis is along the direction opposite the sun and the @xmath38 axis is perpendicular to the sun - planet orbital plane . in hill s formulation the unit of length is @xmath39 , and the unit of time is @xmath40 where @xmath41^{1/2}$ ] is the mean motion of the planet . as usual , the orbit of the planet in the inertial frame is counter - clockwise as viewed from the positive @xmath42 or @xmath38 axis . in hill",
    "s coordinate system the collinear lagrangian points @xmath43 and @xmath44 are located at @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the hill radius is @xmath47 .",
    "similar definitions are used in this paper when the planet orbit is eccentric and/or perturbed by other planets ; in this case the @xmath36 axis points away from the instantaneous position of the sun , the @xmath38 axis is perpendicular to the instantaneous orbital plane of the planet around the sun , and @xmath10 is the initial semi - major axis of the planet .    in the circular",
    "restricted three - body problem , hill s approximation is achieved by taking the limit @xmath25 , where the equations of motion reduce to ( e.g. , hnon 1974 ; murray & dermott 1999 ) : @xmath48    there exists an integral of motion for these equations , @xmath49 which corresponds to the jacobi constant in the circular restricted three - body problem .         for the moment let us restrict ourselves to motion in the sun - planet orbital plane , so @xmath50 at all times .",
    "then to study orbital motions we may use a surface of section defined by @xmath51 , @xmath52 . the trajectory in the four - dimensional @xmath53 phase space",
    "is then represented by a set of points in the @xmath54 plane , and for a given value of the jacobi constant @xmath55 the other two phase - space coordinates can be derived from @xmath56 we define `` prograde '' and `` retrograde '' in the rotating frame unless otherwise noted .",
    "thus retrograde orbits have @xmath57 in this surface of section and prograde orbits have @xmath58 .",
    "a drawback of this surface of section is that a different plot is needed for each value of the jacobi constant @xmath55 . to obtain a global view of the dynamics",
    ", we use a different surface of section defined by @xmath51 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "a trajectory is represented by a point in the @xmath61 plane .",
    "this surface of section was introduced by hnon ( 1969 ; 1970 ) , and we shall call it the hnon surface of section or hnon diagram . the hnon diagram , like any surface of section , will not show orbits that do not cross it ; the usefulness of the hnon diagram derives from the observation that most stable orbits periodically pass close to the point @xmath62for example , this occurs for nearly keplerian orbits close to the planet when their line of apsides precesses past the sun - planet line .",
    "the orbits not shown on the hnon diagram include those confined to some resonant islands , which should occupy a small fraction of phase space , and escape orbits , which we are not interested in anyway .",
    "[ fig : check_henon ] ( _ left panel _ ) is a hnon diagram modeled on figure 12 of hnon ( 1970 ) .",
    "the lagrange points are at @xmath63 .",
    "forbidden regions , in which @xmath64 would be negative , are shaded in gray .",
    "the stable regions of phase space , as estimated by hnon , are denoted by vertical stripes .",
    "the diagram shows that retrograde satellites ( @xmath57 ) have a larger stable region than prograde satellites ( @xmath58 ) , a conclusion consistent with the numerical studies described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "moreover , the stable band in this diagram that begins at @xmath65 and stretches downward to the left shows that retrograde satellites can be stable at distances much larger than the hill radius ; in fact , this band continues to arbitrarily large negative values of @xmath55 and @xmath36 ( see figure 13 of hnon 1970 ) , so retrograde satellites can be stable at arbitrarily large distances from the planet , at least in hill s approximation to the planar circular restricted three - body problem .    in future discussions we divide the stable regions in fig.[fig : check_henon ] into three branches : the inner prograde branch ( @xmath58 ) , the inner retrograde branch ( @xmath57 and @xmath66 ) , and the outer retrograde branch ( @xmath57 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "a simple and rather complete way to sample initial conditions in the planar three - body problem is to use the hnon diagram , i.e. , to sample uniformly in the @xmath61 plane .",
    "as described above , this approach is based on the assumption that most stable orbits periodically have their apocenter or pericenter on the sun - planet line .",
    "note that even without invoking hill s approximation the question of which initial conditions on the hnon diagram correspond to stable orbits is well - posed .",
    "accordingly , we may present our stability results in terms of the hnon diagrams , even though our orbit integrations do not use hill s approximation .",
    "we may compare this approach to the grids of initial conditions used in other investigations of the stability of satellite orbits .",
    "the initial conditions for nesvorn et al.s `` high - resolution survey '' were chosen from a grid of planet - centered osculating keplerian orbital elements , with semi - major axis @xmath68 given typically by @xmath69@xmath70 , eccentricity @xmath71@xmath72 , inclination @xmath73@xmath74 , argument of pericenter @xmath75 , and the other elements distributed uniformly between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : check_henon ] shows similar initial conditions on the hnon diagram ( @xmath73 or @xmath74 and @xmath78 or @xmath74 ) . the conversions from osculating elements to @xmath61",
    "were done using equations ( 8) and ( 10 ) in hnon ( 1970 ) .",
    "it is clear that the initial conditions sampled in nesvorn et al .",
    "do not provide a complete exploration of the phase space in which stable satellite orbits could exist ; in particular , they completely missed the stable region that extends beyond the hill sphere ( of course , such orbits are also excluded from their study by their artificially imposed escape criterion @xmath79 ) .",
    "in fact , most of the stable orbits beyond the hill sphere have hyperbolic osculating elements . in fig .  [",
    "fig : check_henon ] we plot the boundaries that separate regions of hyperbolic osculating elements from those with elliptical osculating elements , where the latter are shaded by a dotted pattern .",
    "the functional forms of these boundaries are : @xmath80    the initial conditions explored by wiegert et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were chosen from a grid of heliocentric osculating keplerian elements , these being the same as the elements of the host planets except for the eccentricity and inclination .",
    "the eccentricity was typically chosen in the range @xmath71@xmath81 and inclination in the range @xmath76@xmath82 . with this procedure ,",
    "zero - inclination orbits appear in the hnon diagram along the locus @xmath83 where the expression for @xmath55 is evaluated using hill s approximation .",
    "the grid sampled by wiegert et al .  for @xmath84 is also shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : check_henon ] , converted from the heliocentric frame using hill s units ( but without hill s approximation ) ; for clarity , only jupiter and uranus are shown .",
    "although wiegert et al.s initial conditions do probe the stability region found by hnon beyond the hill sphere , the coverage is far from complete .                        to extend our study to three - dimensional orbital motions we use a surface of section at @xmath85 , @xmath86 . in the rotating frame ,",
    "we define the initial inclination angle @xmath87 by @xmath88 such that the initial @xmath37 and @xmath38 component velocities are @xmath89 since @xmath52 , the inclination is restricted to the range @xmath90 .",
    "therefore each point in the @xmath61 plane represents a unique set of initial conditions for a given inclination .",
    "the usefulness of the hnon diagram in this case is based on the assumption that most stable orbits periodically have their line of apsides and their line of nodes simultaneously on the sun - planet line .",
    "this assumption is not always valid : it requires that the argument of pericenter @xmath91 is periodically 0 or @xmath92 , while a satellite trapped in the kozai resonance has an argument of pericenter that librates around @xmath93 or @xmath94 ( kozai 1962 ; carruba et al .",
    "we estimate the incompleteness in our survey due to such orbits in  [ sec:3d_result ] .    because the equations of motion are symmetric around the @xmath95 plane",
    ", we may further restrict the inclination to the range @xmath96 .",
    "as in the two - dimensional case , we define `` prograde '' and `` retrograde '' in the rotating frame unless otherwise noted .",
    "thus retrograde orbits have @xmath57 and prograde orbits have @xmath58 at this surface of section @xmath85 , @xmath52 .      even in the two - dimensional case , we expect that the stable regions for distant satellites of the giant planets will be somewhat different from those derived by hnon ( 1970 ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : check_henon ] , since ( i ) hnon s results are based on hill s approximation @xmath97 , while the giant planets have @xmath98 in the range 0.00096 ( jupiter ) to 0.000044 ( uranus ) ; ( ii ) hnon s results assume that the planet orbit is circular , while the giant planets have eccentricities between 0.0086 and 0.056 ; ( iii ) both the satellites and their host planets are subject to perturbations from the other planets . we must carry out long - term numerical integrations of the satellite orbits to assess the influence of these effects on the stability region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : check_henon ] .",
    "we sample the initial conditions using a fine grid on the hnon diagram , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this is shown as the dotted grid in fig .  [",
    "fig : jupiter_henon2d ] .",
    "we then convert them to the non - rotating @xmath34 planetocentric coordinate system where we do the integrations of satellite orbits .",
    "we require that in the rotating frame the sun is always located at the @xmath101 axis , and the angular velocity of the rotating frame equals the instantaneous angular velocity of the sun relative to the planet in the non - rotating planetocentric frame ; thus the angular speed of the rotating frame is time - varying if the planet s orbit is eccentric , and the direction of the @xmath38 axis may vary if the planet s orbit is perturbed by other planets .",
    "we use a unit of length @xmath39 and unit of time @xmath40 to scale the coordinates / velocities between the two frames , where @xmath10 is taken to be the initial semi - major axis of the planet .",
    "the system to be numerically integrated is composed of the four outer giant planets ( or sometimes just one of them ) , the sun , and a satellite around one of the planets ; the satellite is treated as a massless test particle .",
    "we use a second - order wisdom - holman symplectic scheme ( wisdom & holman 1991 ) , as implemented in the * swift * package ( levison & duncan 1994 ) .",
    "following nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we have modified the * swift * code such that the integration of the planets is done in the jacobi coordinate system while that of the satellites is done in the non - rotating planetocentric coordinate system .",
    "we tried different timesteps to optimize between speed and accuracy , and found @xmath102 days is short enough to produce the correct results with reasonable computational cost , for all four planets .",
    "one potential concern is that the wisdom - holman symplectic scheme , as we have implemented it , is designed for nearly keplerian orbits relative to the planet and might break down at large distances from the planet , where the orbits are nearly keplerian relative to the sun .",
    "however , the characteristic orbital period at large distances is equal to the planetary orbital period , and this is much longer than the orbital periods of satellites inside the hill radius that the integrator is designed to follow , so even a crude integrator should work well .",
    "moreover , our ability to reproduce the hnon diagram ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : check_henon ] and the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jupiter_henon2d ] ) , the long - term stability of many of our orbits , and the similarity of the characteristic orbit shapes to those found by hnon ( see  [ sec:2d_result ] ) , all indicate that even at the largest distances probed here , the symplectic integrator seems to work pretty well . as a further check , we have used the bulirsch - stoer integrator to follow satellite orbits around uranus for @xmath29 yr and found almost identical results to the wisdom - holman integrator .",
    "we terminate the integration if the distance of the satellite from the planet exceeds the semi - major axis of the planet since at this point the satellite has escaped according to our definition at the end of  [ sec : intro ] , or if the distance is less than the semi - major axis of the outermost regular satellite of each planet ( being callisto , iapetus , oberon and triton respectively ) , since at this point the satellite lifetime against ejection or collision with the regular satellite or the planet is likely to be short .",
    "any test particles that cross either of these two radii are considered lost .",
    "we have experimented with including the quadrupole moment @xmath16 of the planet ( including the contribution from the inner regular satellites ) but this has no detectable effect on our results .",
    "we first study cases in which the initial velocity vectors of satellites lie in the planet orbital plane , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "as we have described , this is different from hnon s problem because : ( i ) we do not use hill s approximation ; ( ii ) planets such as jupiter have non - zero eccentricity ; and ( iii ) there are gravitational perturbations from other planets .    as an illustration",
    "we show how the stable region changes under various conditions in fig .",
    "[ fig : jupiter_henon2d ] , for satellites around jupiter and an integration time @xmath29 yr .",
    "we consider four situations : ( a ) jupiter moves on its actual ( slightly eccentric ) orbit , including perturbations from the other three giant planets ( _ upper left _ ) ; ( b ) the planar restricted three - body problem , in which jupiter travels on an orbit with its current eccentricity of 0.048 and the other planets are absent ( _ upper right _ ) ; ( c ) the planar circular restricted three - body problem , in which jupiter travels on a circular orbit with its current semi - major axis ( _ bottom left _ ) ; ( d ) same as ( c ) except that the planet mass is @xmath104 of the jupiter mass ( _ bottom right _ ) .    by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : check_henon ] and [ fig : jupiter_henon2d ] it is clear that case ( d ) in the bottom right panel best reproduces the original hnon diagram ; this is not surprising since @xmath105 is smallest so hill s approximation is satisfied best , and the other conditions assumed in hnon s problem ( circular planet orbit , no other planets ) are also satisfied . when using the actual jupiter mass in ( c ) , the outer retrograde stable region ( i.e. , the lower - left branch ) shifts and shrinks .",
    "the overall stability region shrinks further  but does not vanish  when jupiter s orbit is eccentric as in case ( b ) , and for the most realistic case ( a ) .",
    "note that @xmath29 yr is only a small fraction of the lifetime of the solar system , and possible erosion of the stable region over longer times is somewhat indicated by the presence of a few red and blue dots in the upper panels of fig.[fig : jupiter_henon2d ] , indicating orbits that are unstable on timescales of @xmath106 and @xmath107 yr .",
    "these illustrative calculations show that some jovian satellites orbiting well outside the hill radius can survive for at least @xmath29 yr , although the stable region is substantially smaller than in hill s approximation to the circular restricted three - body problem and appears to erode slowly with time .",
    "they also show that the stable region is larger ( relative to the hill radius ) if the planet mass @xmath98 is smaller , suggesting that the stable regions of the other giant planets may be larger than jupiter s .",
    "we now extend these calculations in the following ways : ( i ) we examine satellite orbits around all four giant planets , using the actual planetary orbits including perturbations from the three other planets ; ( ii ) since stable orbits are found at the most negative jacobi constant ( @xmath108 ) examined in fig.[fig : jupiter_henon2d ] , we extend the grid of initial conditions to @xmath109 ; ( iii ) we extend the integration time from @xmath29 yr to @xmath30 yr .    the results are shown in fig .

    "( 2000 ) found no orbits that survived for @xmath110 yr , but this may reflect their less complete coverage of phase space . for saturn , the outer retrograde stable region completely disappears in less than @xmath29 yr , a conclusion already reached by wiegert et al . for uranus and neptune , in contrast , there is a large stable region of outer retrograde orbits remaining after @xmath30 yr .",
    "we expect that the stable regions around jupiter , uranus , and neptune will shrink somewhat further between @xmath30 yr and @xmath111 yr , the approximate age of the solar system , so we integrated some outer retrograde satellite orbits around these three planets for @xmath0 yr .",
    "we found that about a third of the jovian orbits and over half of the outer retrograde orbits for uranus and neptune shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : other_henon2d ] still survive .",
    "thus it is very likely that uranus and neptune could still host primordial satellites on such orbits to the present time .",
    "it is likely , but not certain , that similar satellites could survive around jupiter , at least in small volumes of phase space .",
    "the shrinkage of the stable region of the outer retrograde branch between @xmath29 and @xmath30 yr , as well as the lack of stable outer retrograde orbits around saturn , appear to be mainly due to perturbations from the other planets . to demonstrate this , we ran two @xmath30 yr integrations for saturn only and",

    "is elongated along the sun - planet axis while the inner retrograde orbit ( middle panel ) is elongated perpendicular to the sun - planet axis .",
    "the outer retrograde orbit ( bottom panel ) is also elongated perpendicular to the sun - planet axis and oscillates about the planet as an ellipse with an axis ratio of approximately 2:1 ( compare fig .",
    "11 of hnon 1970 ) , as one would expect from epicycle theory .",
    "note that the stable retrograde orbits with @xmath36 close to @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig : other_henon2d ] regularly cross the hill radius .",
    "hence such orbits are missed by the surveys of both wiegert et al .  and nesvorn et al . , who terminate their integrations if @xmath120 or @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "we now extend the initial conditions in  [ sec:2d_result ] to three dimensions by including the scaled vertical coordinate @xmath38 . as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : hill_equation ] , we consider a surface of section @xmath85 , @xmath52 at @xmath122 .",
    "similar to the two - dimensional case , we sample the initial conditions using a fine grid in the @xmath61 plane , and use equation ( [ eqn:3d_vel ] ) to generate initial velocities .",
    "we choose a sequence of inclinations in the rotating frame , @xmath123 .",
    "each satellite orbit is then integrated for @xmath30 yr along with the four giant planets and the sun .",
    "the general behavior when incorporating inclination is the erosion of stable regions in the hnon diagram . as an example",
    ", we show the results for uranus in fig . [ fig : uranus_henon_3d ] . the outer retrograde orbits quickly become unstable when the initial inclination exceeds @xmath124 .",
    "the inner retrograde stable region erodes with increasing inclination and disappears at @xmath125 .",
    "the inner prograde stable region can survive even at @xmath126 .",
    "this asymmetry between inner retrograde and prograde orbits is due in part to the definition of inclination in the rotating frame , under certain circumstances retrograde orbits in the rotating frame can even be prograde in the non - rotating frame . ] .",
    "however , even when inclination is defined in the non - rotating frame such an asymmetry may still be present ( see uk & burns 2004 for a discussion of the dynamical reasons for the asymmetry ) .    to separate the destabilizing effects of inclination from the effects of perturbations from other planets , we also ran these three - dimensional simulations for uranus without the other planets .",
    "we found that for @xmath127 , perturbations from other planets do play a major role in eroding the region of stable outer retrograde orbits , as illustrated by comparing the upper left and lower right panels of fig.[fig : uranus_henon_3d ] , which show the hnon diagram for @xmath128 with and without the other planets .",
    "however , for @xmath129 the results for uranus alone are almost identical to the realistic case which includes perturbations from the three other planets .",
    "this result suggests that bound retrograde orbits outside the hill sphere may not exist at all for @xmath130 .",
    "this is expected because the coriolis force , which stabilizes outer retrograde orbits by bending their trajectory towards the planet in the rotating frame , is reduced when the inclination angle @xmath87 increases .",
    "this shrinkage of the stable outer retrograde branch with inclination is already noticed by comparing the right panel of fig.[fig : uranus_only_henon2d ] ( @xmath131 ) and the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : uranus_henon_3d ] ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "note that the inclinations @xmath87 are planetocentric and measured in the rotating frame . for low - inclination orbits along the outer retrograde branch they can be converted to heliocentric inclinations @xmath132 using the approximate formula for small @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath133 is the heliocentric eccentricity .",
    "thus our stability region @xmath127 corresponds roughly to @xmath135 for @xmath136 , the typical heliocentric eccentricity of surviving satellites for uranus and neptune ( see fig.[fig : obs_ang_vel ] ) ; this is in reasonable agreement with wiegert et al.s estimate that most of their long - lived orbits had @xmath137 , especially considering that our sampling of initial conditions is more complete than theirs .",
    "mikkola & innanen ( 1997 ) and mikkola et al .  ( 2006 ) estimate analytically that the outer retrograde orbits are unstable if @xmath138 ( for a circular planet orbit ) , which implies instability if @xmath139 .",
    "our own results show that all the test particles with initial positions outside the hill sphere cross the escape radius @xmath10 well before @xmath106 yr for @xmath140 .",
    "as described at the end of  [ subsec : hill_equation ] , a limitation of these results is that the hnon diagram we have used will not display orbits trapped in a kozai resonance , or other stable orbits whose argument of pericenter does not periodically pass through 0 or @xmath92 . to estimate the contribution of such orbits ,",
    "we have constructed a different set of three - dimensional hnon diagrams in which the initial conditions are changed from our usual choice @xmath141 to @xmath142 ( i.e. , when the orbit is at its maximum height above the planet s orbital plane , rather than crossing the orbital plane ) . in this case , we define the initial inclination @xmath143 in the rotating frame by @xmath144 the results are shown in figure [ fig : uranus_henon_3d_alt ] , which should be compared to figure [ fig : uranus_henon_3d ] . each point in either set of hnon diagrams corresponds to a unique orbit , but orbits appearing in the hnon diagrams of one figure at a given value of @xmath145 may or may not appear in the other figure , where they will have the same value of @xmath55 but possibly different values of @xmath36 and inclination .",
    "the stable regions are somewhat larger in figure [ fig : uranus_henon_3d_alt ] at a given inclination  for example , a few outer retrograde satellites survive for @xmath30 yr at @xmath146but the conclusions described above are not significantly altered . in the following discussion , we neglect stable orbits that do not appear in our fiducial hnon diagrams ( i.e. , using the surface of section @xmath147 ) ; thus we may slightly underestimate the size of the stable regions . more discussion on orbits trapped in the kozai resonance inside the hill sphere can be found in carruba et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "we now project the phase - space volume that hosts stable orbits onto coordinate space , to explore where stable satellites might be found .",
    "we plot the positions of stable orbits in the two - dimensional plane with coordinates @xmath148 $ ] ( non - rotating frame ) or @xmath149 $ ] ( rotating frame ) .",
    "prograde and retrograde orbits are plotted separately on the left and right sides of a given figure panel , where `` prograde '' and `` retrograde '' are defined in the frame used .",

    "9 - 12 of nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , though slightly larger because we show instantaneous position rather than semi - major axis . for jupiter and saturn ,",
    "the stable prograde orbits generally extend to @xmath151 ; the stable retrograde orbits can extend further to @xmath3 , and nearly coplanar retrograde orbits even extend to @xmath4 for jupiter . for uranus and neptune , both the prograde and retrograde stable orbits can extend a little bit further relative to the hill sphere .",
    "no stable orbits exist at high latitudes , presumably because of kozai oscillations ( kozai 1962 ; carruba et al .",
    "2002 ; nesvorn et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it is also notable that there are stable regions beyond the hill sphere for jupiter , uranus and neptune , as we discussed in previous sections .",
    "this is particularly the case for uranus and neptune .",
    "most of these distant stable satellites are concentrated close to the orbital plane of the planet as for jupiter , although the appearance of a very thin layer in figs.[fig : stability_region_jupiter ] ( jupiter)- [ fig : stability_region_neptune ] ( neptune ) is somewhat an artifact of the coarse sampling of inclinations in our initial conditions ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "stable satellites can be found as far as @xmath152 from jupiter and even @xmath8 for uranus and neptune , and as high as @xmath153 above the orbital plane for the latter two planets . in the following section we discuss briefly the strategy of searches for these distant satellites .",
    "we have conducted a systematic survey of the stable regions of satellites around giant planets in the solar system , using numerical orbital integrations that include gravitational perturbations from the other planets .",
    "we confirm previous results for satellites within the hill sphere : stable retrograde satellites can exist further out than prograde satellites ( e.g. , hnon 1970 ; hamilton & krivov 1997 ; nesvorn et al.2003 ) ; and stable orbits can not exist at high inclinations ( e.g. , carruba et al .",
    "2002 ; nesvorn et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we also confirm and extend the conclusions of wiegert et al.(2000 ) that distant retrograde satellites ( `` retrograde '' as defined in the rotating frame ) can survive well beyond the hill sphere for at least @xmath30@xmath0 yr , and probably for the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "uranus and neptune are the most promising host planets for such distant satellites , since their stability regions have the largest extent ( e.g. , fig.[fig : stability_region_uranus]-[fig : stability_region_neptune ] ) .",
    "jupiter has a smaller stable region ( fig.[fig : stability_region_jupiter ] ) , and saturn appears to have no stable regions beyond the hill radius ( fig.[fig : stability_region_saturn ] ) .      to check whether any of the proposed distant satellites have already been discovered as centaurs , we take the positions and velocities of the known centaurs from the iau minor planet center that have planetocentric distances smaller than the semi - major axes of each of the four giant planets at the last observed epoch .",
    "there are 31 centaurs ( jupiter 1 ; uranus 16 ; neptune 14 ) that satisfy the criterion .",
    "we numerically integrated these objects along with the sun and giant planets for @xmath30 yr , but none of them survived as satellites according to the definition in  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "searches for satellites far beyond the hill radius can be carried out either with dedicated deep , wide - angle surveys around the giant planets , or through all - sky surveys such as pan - starrs and lsst .",
    "the most promising search areas are close to the orbital plane of the planet , since only low - inclination orbits survive ( e.g. , compare fig.[fig : other_henon2d ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : uranus_henon_3d ] ) . in fig.[fig : obs_ang_vel ] ( left panel ) we show the heliocentric angular velocity of the stable outer retrograde satellites as a function of angular distance from the planet as viewed from the sun , for jupiter ( black ) , uranus ( blue ) and neptune ( red ) respectively , sampled every myr between @xmath150 and @xmath30 yr .    in the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : obs_ang_vel ] we show histograms of the difference in heliocentric semi - major axis from their host planet and heliocentric eccentricities for the stable outer retrograde satellites .",
    "these distributions can be used to cull a large sample for potential satellites .",
    "once a candidate is identified with reliable orbit elements , a long - term orbital integration should be run to confirm its satellite nature .",
    "the discovery and characterization of satellites beyond the hill sphere would provide rich information about the early formation of the solar system .",
    "fabrycky ( 2008 ; also see kortenkamp 2005 ) recently performed simulations of capture of neighboring planetesimals from the circumstellar disk during slow planet growth , and found that such distant satellites are a natural outcome for uranus and neptune .",
    "thus an inventory of this potential population of bodies would enhance our understanding of the formation of planets and their satellites in the early solar system , and the properties of the primordial planetesimal disk ."
