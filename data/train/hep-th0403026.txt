    "in inflationary cosmology @xcite , a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations is produced as comoving scales leave the hubble horizon during an early burst of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "in cyclic cosmology @xcite , the _ same _ perturbation spectrum is produced as comoving scales leave the hubble horizon during a period of slow decelerated contraction @xcite .",
    "this agreement between two physically dissimilar models is unexpected , but not coincidental .",
    "as we shall show , the relationship between inflation and the cyclic model may be viewed as a special case of a surprisingly simple and general duality between expanding and contracting cosmologies .",
    "a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with a single scalar field @xmath7 and potential @xmath1 is a simple yet important system .",
    "in particular , it is the canonical 4d effective theory used to model the production of density perturbations in both inflationary and cyclic cosmology .",
    "recent results hint at a connection between two apparently  unrelated regimes of this model : ( _ i _ ) expanding , in the @xmath8 limit , and ( _ ii _ ) contracting , in the @xmath9 limit . here",
    "@xmath10 denotes the ratio of pressure to energy density .",
    "long - wavelength scale - invariant density perturbations are produced in the limits ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) @xcite , and the small deviations from scale invariance near these two limits are related by the simple substitution @xmath11 , where @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the relationship noted in @xcite between expanding @xmath13 models and contracting @xmath14 models , turns out to be a special case of a general and exact duality relating expanding and contracting models with identical perturbation spectra . in this paper , we derive this duality , focusing on the case where @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) is time - independent . in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we generalize the discussion to the case where @xmath15 is time - varying .",
    "when @xmath15 is constant , or varies sufficiently slowly , the duality is simple : an expanding universe characterized by @xmath15 produces _ exactly _ the same scalar perturbations as a contracting universe characterized by @xmath4 .",
    "this duality applies in arbitrary spacetime dimension ( not just 3 + 1 ) ; it applies for all @xmath16 ( not just the @xmath8 and @xmath9 limits discussed in @xcite ) ; it applies to all wavelengths ( not just the long - wavelength limit ) ; it applies to _ both _ the dominant scalar perturbation mode _ and _ a subdominant remainder ( which are related to the growing and decaying modes , respectively ) .",
    "this duality is of general theoretical interest since it provides a new relationship between expanding and contracting universes , and exposes an unexpected symmetry of cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "it is also relevant to cosmological models , like the ekpyrotic and cyclic @xcite scenarios , in which perturbations produced during a period of contraction are proposed to propagate through a bounce into a subsequent expanding phase .",
    "these models require that the growing - mode long - wavelength perturbation spectrum is preserved across the bounce .",
    "this has been a controversial matter . at first , some authors argued that growing - mode perturbations produced in a contracting phase must match to pure decaying - mode perturbations as one follows them across a bounce into an expanding phase @xcite . at heart , this conclusion followed from requiring that the bounce corresponds to a comoving or constant - energy - density slice .",
    "however , recent five dimensional calculations @xcite indicate that comoving or constant - energy - density slices are inappropriate for matching , since the bounce event ( represented in five dimensions by a brane collision ) is not synchronous in these slices . matching on collision - synchronous slices results in the propagation of growing - mode perturbations across a bounce , with no change in the shape of the long - wavelength spectrum",
    ". other aspects of the cyclic and ekpyrotic models have been criticized @xcite ( see @xcite for replies ) , and some have argued that a bounce is impossible altogether @xcite . while the consistency of a bounce remains to be proven , recent work has shown that the traditional hazard of chaotic mixmaster behavior is strongly suppressed in the contracting phase of the cyclic model @xcite .",
    "the metric perturbations exhibit ultralocal behavior in which anisotropies remain small , right up to a few planck times before the bounce .",
    "in this situation , causality suggests that the bounce should not disturb correlations on macroscopic scales over which there can be no communication in this finite time interval . under these conditions ,",
    "works by several groups @xcite suggest that perturbations generated during the contracting phase may pass into the expanding phase .",
    "the subject continues to be an area of active research .",
    "if the latter suggestions are made rigorous , it would give added significance to the results presented herein .",
    "other dualities have been identified in the literature @xcite that relate cosmological solutions and perturbations .",
    "see section [ other ] for a comparison .",
    "the duality presented here has the distinctive property that it relates two solutions that are stable under perturbations .",
    "hence , both solutions can plausibly play a role in realistic cosmological models .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ background ] , we introduce the background ( unperturbed ) model : a spatially - flat frw model with scalar field @xmath7 , potential @xmath1 , and constant @xmath15 . in section [ scalars ]",
    ", we briefly review scalar perturbation theory , before deriving exact solutions for mukhanov s @xmath17 and @xmath18 variables .",
    "we note that @xmath17 is invariant under @xmath11 .",
    "this invariance is independent of our vacuum choice for the fluctuations , and provides our first glimpse of the duality . in section [ grow_decay ]",
    "we use @xmath17 and @xmath18 to separate scalar perturbations into pieces that are dominant and subdominant at long wavelengths , and show that each piece is _ both independently invariant _ under @xmath19 .",

    "the hubble horizon is a curve connecting the @xmath44 vertex to the lightlike boundary , but the precise curve depends on @xmath15 . for illustration , we have shown the horizon for @xmath45 in ( a , c ) and for @xmath46 in ( b , d ) . in this paper , we focus on cases ( a ) and ( d ) , in which comoving scales exit the hubble horizon.,width=288 ]    the penrose diagrams for these 4 possibilities are shown in figure [ penrose ] .",

    "by contrast , the dualities in table i relate two different cosmological background solutions corresponding to _ two different lagrangians _ : an expanding universe , with potential @xmath1 , is dual to a contracting universe , with a _ different _ potential @xmath191 .",
    "beyond its inherent theoretical interest , our duality may be observationally relevant if ( as discussed in section [ intro ] ) long - wavelength correlations produced during a contracting phase successfully propagate into a subsequent expanding phase .",
    "this suggests a fundamental degeneracy : an ideal measurement of the  primordial \" scalar perturbation spectrum may be unable to determine whether the perturbations were generated by an expanding phase or by its contracting dual .",
    "luckily , as shown in section [ tensors ] , tensor perturbations break this degeneracy : an expanding model produces a much redder tensor spectrum than its contracting dual . in particular , a detection of tensors in the cosmic microwave background would indicate that these perturbations were generated in an expanding phase , since the dual contracting phase would produce an undetectably small tensor spectrum on these cosmological length scales @xcite .    using the background solutions ( [ background_soln ] )",
    ", we may think of the duality as relating two different scale factors , @xmath22 and @xmath192 , or two different scalar potentials , @xmath1 and @xmath191 .",
    "alternatively , recall that @xmath193 and @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the proper time of a comoving observer and @xmath196 is the  hubble scale . \"",
    "thus , two dual universes are related by @xmath197    so the duality effectively swaps the scale factor with the hubble scale , and simultaneously swaps expansion and contraction .",
    "for example , in the @xmath147 ( @xmath8 ) limit , the scale factor grows rapidly while the hubble length grows slowly ; whereas in the @xmath149 ( @xmath9 ) limit , the hubble length shrinks rapidly while the scale factor shrinks slowly .",
    "expanding models in which modes exit the horizon most rapidly ( @xmath8 ) and most slowly ( @xmath198 ) , are associated with contracting models in which modes exit most rapidly ( @xmath9 ) and most slowly ( @xmath198 ) , respectively .    finally , let us mention several open questions .",
    "we have studied the duality using a simple model  spatially - flat frw spacetime with a single scalar field @xmath7 ; what happens in more complicated models ? we have used linear perturbation theory ; what happens in the nonlinear regime ?",
    "we have restricted ourselves to time - independent @xmath15 ; what if we allow time - varying @xmath15 ?",
    "this final question is treated in a companion paper @xcite .",

    "gauge - invariant perturbation theory in @xmath5 spacetime dimensions is treated thoroughly in @xcite ( see especially the appendices therein ) .        where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are given by ( [ rho_p ] ) . instead of @xmath10 ,",

    "in particular , we can again introduce scalar perturbations through equations ( [ perturbed_metric ] , [ perturbed_scalar_field ] ) , and describe these perturbations with a single gauge - invariant variable .",
    "the gauge - invariant newtonian potential , @xmath60 , is most easily understood in `` newtonian gauge '' ( @xmath207 ) , where it is related to the metric perturbations in a simple way : @xmath208 .",
    "the gauge - invariant variable @xmath61 is most easily understood in `` comoving gauge '' ( @xmath209 ) , where it is related to the spatial metric perturbation in a simple way : @xmath67 .",
    "note also that @xmath69 in this gauge . if we take the @xmath5-dimensional definitions of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 to be : @xmath210 @xmath211 then sections [ scalars ] and [ grow_decay ] immediately generalize @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to show that equations ( [ uv_eom ] ) through ( [ f_dom ] ) all remain true in @xmath5 dimensions , provided we take @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 to be given by their @xmath5-dimensional definitions ( [ new_def_eps ] ) , ( [ new_def_uv ] ) and ( [ new_def_theta ] ) .    in particular , this means that the duality extends to @xmath5-dimensions : @xmath17 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 are all invariant under @xmath11 .",
    "the duality pairs expanding solutions in the range @xmath214 with contracting solutions in the range @xmath41 . note that for @xmath215 , there are some contracting models with no expanding dual ; but for @xmath216 , every expanding model has a contracting dual , and _ vice versa_.            with @xmath15 given by ( [ new_def_eps ] ) .",
    "note that these expressions are invariant under @xmath11 . as shown in @xcite",
    ", we may again introduce tensor perturbations through eq .",
