    "the covariant self - consistent mean - field approach to the nuclear many - body problem has reached a mature stage @xcite .",
    "models based on the relativistic mean - field approximation are successfully employed in the description of structure phenomena not only in medium - heavy and heavy stable nuclei , but also in regions of exotic nuclei far from the line of @xmath0-stability and close to the nucleon drip - lines .",
    "most applications have been based on the finite - range meson - exchange representation of the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory , in which the nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons coupled to exchange mesons and the electromagnetic field through an effective lagrangian .",
    "a medium dependence can be introduced either by including non - linear meson self - interaction terms in the lagrangian @xcite , or by assuming an explicit density dependence for the meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the former approach has been adopted in the construction of several very successful phenomenological rmf interactions , for instance , the popular nl3  @xcite parameterization of the effective lagrangian . in the latter case",
    ", the density dependence of the meson - nucleon vertex functions can be determined either from microscopic dirac - brueckner calculations in nuclear matter @xcite , or it can be completely phenomenological @xcite , with parameters adjusted to data on finite nuclei and empirical properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter . a series of recent studies has shown that , when compared with standard non - linear meson - exchange effective lagrangians , effective interactions with an explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings are more flexible and provide an improved description of asymmetric nuclear matter , neutron matter and finite nuclei far from stability .",
    "an alternative representation of the self - consistent relativistic mean - field approach to nuclear structure is formulated in terms of point - coupling ( contact ) nucleon - nucleon interactions . when applied in the description of finite nuclei , the framework of relativistic mean - field point - coupling ( rmf - pc ) models @xcite produces results that are comparable to those obtained in the meson - exchange picture . in principle , the point - coupling approach is more general and the interaction terms are not restricted by the constraints imposed by the finite range of meson exchange .",
    "of course , also in the case of contact interactions , medium effects can be taken into account by the inclusion of higher order interaction terms , for instance , six - nucleon vertices @xmath1 , and eight - nucleon vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] , or it can be encoded in the effective couplings , i.e. in the strength parameters of the interaction in the isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "several studies of the rmf - pc framework have been reported over the last ten years , but it is only recently that reliable and accurate phenomenological parameterizations have been adjusted and applied in the description of ground state properties of finite nuclei on a quantitative level .",

    "@xcite brvenich et al . have adjusted the pc - f1 set of coupling constants for an effective point - coupling lagrangian with higher order interaction terms .",
    "the pc - f1 interaction has been tested in the calculation of ground state properties of a large number of spherical and deformed nuclei , and the results are on the level of the best meson - exchange effective interactions",

    "this approach has been tested in the analysis of the equations of state for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , and of bulk and single - nucleon properties of finite nuclei . in comparison with purely phenomenological mean - field approaches ,",

    "a number of studies have shown that , both for finite - range meson - exchange and for point - coupling mean - field models , the empirical data set of ground - state properties of finite nuclei can only determine six or seven parameters in the general expansion of the effective lagrangian in powers of the fields and their derivatives @xcite .",
    "the influence of the adjustment procedure and of the choice of ground - state data on the properties and predictive power of the relativistic mean - field model with point - couplings has recently been investigated in ref .  @xcite . while virtually all phenomenological relativistic effective interactions have been adjusted to empirical properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , and to ground - state properties of a set of spherical nuclei , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that a comparison of relativistic rpa results on multipole giant resonances with experimental excitation energies can provide additional constrains on the parameters that characterize the isoscalar and isovector channels of the effective interactions .",
    "data on giant resonances have been taken into account in the recent adjustment of a new improved relativistic mean - field effective interaction with explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings @xcite .",
    "relativistic rpa calculations have been performed since the early eighties , but it is only more recently that non - linear meson self - interaction terms or density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings have been included in the rrpa framework @xcite . as in the case of ground - state properties ,",
    "the inclusion of a medium dependence in the residual interaction is necessary for a quantitative description of collective excited states .",
    "another essential feature of the rrpa is the fully consistent treatment of the dirac sea of negative energy states .",
    "in addition to the usual particle - hole pairs , the rrpa configuration space must also include pair - configurations built from positive - energy states occupied in the ground - state solution , and empty negative - energy states in the dirac sea .",
    "these configurations ensure not only current conservation and the decoupling of the spurious states  @xcite , but also a quantitative comparison with the experimental excitation energies of giant resonances  @xcite .",

    "moreover , the allowed interval of @xmath96 values is so narrow , that there is no room for any significant enhancement of the single - nucleon level densities in the framework of the standard phenomenological rmf models @xcite .",
    "these arguments are also valid for point - coupling rmf models .",
    "specifically , for the pc - f1 effective interaction the dirac mass @xmath105 , the effective mass @xmath106 , and therefore one should not expect pc - f1 to accurately reproduce data on the isgqr . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figd ] we plot the rrpa isoscalar quadrupole strength distribution in @xmath64pb , calculated with the pc - f1 interaction .",
    "the experimental excitation energy of the isgqr ( @xmath107 mev @xcite ) is denoted by the arrow . because of the low nucleon effective mass , the calculated excitation energy of the isgqr is above the corresponding experimental value .",
    "similar results are also obtained for lighter spherical nuclei . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we display a comparison between the experimental excitation energies and the pc - f1 predictions for the location of the isgqr in @xmath91zr , @xmath92sn , @xmath108sn , @xmath95sn , @xmath109sm , and @xmath64pb .",
    "for all these nuclei the calculated isgqr excitation energy is more than 1 mev above the experimental centroids @xmath67 .",
    "during the last decade standard meson - exchange rmf models , with either non - linear meson self - interaction terms , or with density - dependent meson - nucleon vertex functions , have been very successfully applied in the description of a variety of nuclear structure phenomena . however , the explicit inclusion of the meson degrees of freedom , in particular of the fictitious @xmath110-meson , places physical constraints on the model parameters , thereby reducing the predictive power of the model . the limitations of the meson - exchange representation of the rmf theory are especially pronounced in the description of surface properties of finite nuclei .",
    "virtually all meson - exchange rmf effective interactions , which otherwise accurately reproduce data on bulk nuclear properties and giant resonances , underestimate the empirical surface thickness .",
    "this does not seem to be the case for the self - consistent point - coupling rmf models , which therefore represent an interesting alternative to the standard meson - exchange picture of the effective nuclear interaction .",
    "self - consistent point - coupling rmf models have recently attracted considerable interest . for the phenomenological models ,",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the new pc - f1 effective interaction reproduces data with a quality comparable to that of standard meson - exchange forces . however , all calculations performed so far have only considered ground - state nuclear properties .",
    "it is , therefore , important to develop a consistent microscopic framework , based on the point - coupling rmf effective lagrangian , in which dynamical properties and excited states can be investigated .    in this work",
    "the matrix equations of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) have been derived for the point - coupling lagrangian of the ( rmf ) model .",
    "fully consistent rmf plus rpa , and rhb plus qrpa illustrative calculations of the isoscalar monopole , isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole response of spherical medium - heavy and heavy nuclei have been performed .",
    "a comparison with experiment has shown that the best point - coupling effective interactions , and in particular pc - f1 , accurately reproduce not only ground - state properties , but also data on excitation energies of giant resonances .",
    "we have also investigated the possibility to determine the parameters of the isovector - scalar channel from r(q)rpa calculations of the isovector dipole response .",
    "this is really not feasible because the isovector - scalar terms influence the symmetry energy only for nucleon densities well above the saturation density , whereas the density region characteristic for the ivgdr is located below the saturation density .",
    "the r(q)rpa based on the point - coupling rmf models presents an important addition to the theoretical tools that are employed in description of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "future applications will include studies of the multipole response of exotic nuclei far from the valley of @xmath0-stability . on a more microscopic level",
