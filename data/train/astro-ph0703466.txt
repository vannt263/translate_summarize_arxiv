    "in the present work we are interested to model a gravitational @xmath0 disk living in a universe endowed with extra dimensions . the motivation comes from the various properties one can derive as rotation curves and density and pressure profiles now carried on with a more general geometrical approach for space - time . a first serious accomplishment at this direction is only achieved by investigating solutions of einstein field equations in axially symmetric configurations in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "exact solutions of einstein field equations in axially symmetric configurations are an important tool to understand the dynamical properties of real systems which can be described approximately by a thin disk . in this sense ,",
    "axially symmetric solutions have great astrophysical interest , because they can be used to model galaxies and accretion disks .",
    "a long range of disk solutions was derived with or without radial pressure .",
    "solutions for static disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "a large class of static thin disks solutions were obtained by letelier and oliveira @xcite using the inverse scattering method .",
    "disks with radial tension have been considered in @xcite , and disk models with electric fields @xcite and magnetic fields @xcite , and both magnetic and electric fields @xcite .",
    "solutions for self - similar static disks were analyzed by lynden - bell and pineault @xcite , and lemos @xcite .",
    "another relevant approaches are the superposition of static disks with black holes or disk solutions with halos @xcite , and see other important astrophysical solutions to mimic agns in @xcite . recently",
    "vogt and letelier refined general relativist models of galaxies in a considerable way @xcite .",
    "important discussions about the role of general relativistic disks to explain rotation curves of galaxies can be found , e.g. , in @xcite and essential counter - arguments in @xcite . on axisymmetric geometries in @xmath1 dimensions ,",
    "generalized weyl solutions in @xmath1 dimensions were presented by emparan and reall @xcite and important objects were classified by them , as black rings and kaluza - klein bubbles . about disk rotation curves in higher dimensions",
    "see for instance @xcite . for other important works about solutions of einstein equations in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "see @xcite .    the treatment proposed at the present work permits to find important imprints of extra dimensions in the density profile of the disk .",
    "a first result obtained by introducing extra dimensions shows important modifications in rotation curves profiles . as rotation curves are the major tool for determining the distribution of mass in disk galaxies , and are also important to study kinematics and to infer the evolutionary histories in galactic systems , as also the most basic and classic manner to bring on the presence of dark matter in galaxies , maybe it is possible that a relativistic disk model embedded in a multidimensional universe shed some light on the dark matter problem",
    "actually , dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most intringuing problems in astronomy , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "this puzzle has paramount consequences on the deep comprehension of the universe , matter in general and particle physics in particular .",
    "rotation curves of galaxies and gravitational lensing of galactic clusters are the main basic observational tools to understand the presence of dm in universe @xcite . on this behalf",
    ", the nature of dm can be investigated by applying a range of gravitational models : by postulating a halo of exotic matter around galaxies ( e.g. cdm models @xcite ) or by modifying gravity at large scales ( e.g. mond , teves and stvg @xcite ; as an important review about the subject see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another relevant alternative approach is to enhance astrophysical and cosmological models by using extra dimensions @xcite . here , to understand the role of dynamics in producing a dm behavior in galactic disks , as a first step , we model and investigate a general relativistic disk and",
    "also calculate the gravitational lensing regime for a galactic cluster living in a universe endowed with extra dimensions .",
    "we adhere to the standard general relativity , just in space - time with 5 spatial dimensions .",
    "an important question , unanswered until now , is why a galactic disk does not follow a gravitational newtonian or general relativistic 4d profile for rotation curves .",
    "the extradimensional argument is a proposed solution in particle physics field : there the cosmological amount of dark matter is used to calculate cross sections of postulated kaluza - klein ( kk ) particles to be tested in future experiments at colliders @xcite . here",
    "we follow another direction to show quantitatively how one can calculate rotation curves from gr in a higher dimensional pattern .",
    "therefore , we construct a disk endowed with extra dimensions by solving the vacuum einstein equations for an extension of the weyl s metric . the main purpose of the work is to construct a top - down model , where we are interested in what is coming to pass at large scales assuming a multidimensional scenario . usually thin disks are solved from chazy - curzon or schwarzschild solutions and as the simplest example , we solve the case for a @xmath2 space - time .",
    "the system is constructed from such commonly used solutions : they are employed to generate the disk by introducing discontinuities in the first derivatives of the metric functions ( image method ) .",
    "two constants of motion from projection of extradimensional particle velocities are the free parameters of the model .",
    "we prevent the _ ad hoc _ adjustment of such parameters with observed rotation curves , preferring to investigate values where the disk becomes stable .",
    "the stability is achieved when the disk is newtonian - like ( where such parameters are null ) or for a tiny range of values that astonishingly makes the circular geodesics fit with great precision the rotation curves of many spiral galaxies .",
    "we compare such results to well succeeded astrophysical dark matter profiles and demonstrate that our predictions recover naturally gravity at solar system and give the same gravitational lensing as does a dynamically successful dark halo model .",
    "we propose , following such results , that the geometry of a space - time endowed with extra dimensions modify gravity at certain distance / mass scales and dark matter is replaced by the picture of a multidimensional universe .",
    "we also consider , for completeness , another interpretation where the geometry can induce kaluza - klein fields and particles on the @xmath0 space - time , and the present model could be a interesting constraint for theories on kk dark matter particles .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section [ sec:4ddisks ] we present the principal aspects of static thin disk solutions in @xmath0 and the expression for the energy - momentum tensor of the disk . in section [ sec : weyld ] , we derive general weyl s solutions . to derive weyl s solutions to higher dimensions is to find all solutions of the vacuum einstein equations that admit @xmath3 orthogonal commuting killing vector fields .",
    "we show , following @xcite , that in @xmath1 dimensions , einstein equations in a weyl geometry is reduced to the laplace s equations , what permits to use the image method to construct a disk living in a @xmath1 dimensional universe . in section [ sec:6d ]",
    "we exemplify by constructing a simple multidimensional disk model using six dimensional axially symmetric einstein equations in vacuum , with a `` schwarzschild solution '' for the four dimensional part ; the extra dimensional part is solved with a chazy - curzon solution .",
    "these solutions are employed to generate a disk by introducing discontinuities in the first derivatives of the metric functions ( image method ) . in section [ sec : rotations ] we find a equation for the circular geodesic orbits ( rotation curves ) and study the stability of such orbits in section [ sec : stability ] both by the rayleigh criterion and by a perturbative method .",
    "results and graphics for stable rotation curves and comparison to observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies are showed in section [ sec : curves ] . in section [ solar ]",
    "we introduce quantitative arguments to show that at solar system scales , the model presents the correct behavior for rotation curves ( a newtonian - like profile ) . in section [ sec : lensing ] we derive the gravitational lensing regime of the model to a spherically symmetric cluster of galaxies .",
    "discussions about such results is done in the concluding remarks ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "and although the main purpose of the present work is to construct a top - down model and not to shed light on a fundamental microscopic theory we also illustrate another possibility , considering that our model could constrain a kaluza - klein dark matter particle to be tested at large hadron collider ( lhc ) in next years , where we write considerations about the compactification of a @xmath2 space - time following the example presented . in what follows ,",
    "we do @xmath4 .",
    "much endeavor has been strongly attached to advance in techniques for finding general relativistic exact solutions in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest accomplishments in this direction was attained by weyl @xcite , who found the general static axisymmetric solution of the vacuum einstein equations : [ 4dweylmetric ] s^2 = -e^2 t^2 + e^-2 ( e^2 ( r^2 + z^2 ) + r^2 ^2 ) , where @xmath5 is an arbitrary axisymmetric solution of laplace s equation in a three - dimensional _ flat _ space with line element [ flatspace ] ^2 = r^2 + r^2 ^2 + z^2 , and @xmath6 satisfies _ , r = r [ _ , r^2 - _ , z^2 ] , _ , z = 2 r _ ,",
    "r_,z , where @xmath7 . the solution of these equations is given by a line integral .",
    "since @xmath8 is harmonic , it can be regarded as a newtonian potential produced by certain ( axisymmetric ) sources . since in this",
    "coordinate the spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein equations correspond to a bar of density 1/2 , one needs to be careful in the use of newtonian images @xcite .    as an illustration , the metric ( [ 4dweylmetric ] ) for a static",
    "axially symmetric @xmath0 space - time can be written in quasicylindrical coordinates @xmath9 in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 only . in the vacuum ,",
    "the einstein equations are equivalent to @xmath16 @xmath17 let @xmath18 .",
    "it is possible to consider @xmath11 as the real part of an analytical function @xmath19 . noting that @xmath20 , one can write @xmath21 . or even , @xmath22",
    ". thus without lossing generality one can choose @xmath23 .",
    "in such a way we can write @xmath24 as @xmath25}&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\int r\\{[\\phi^2_{,r}-\\phi^2_{,z}]\\mathrm{d}r\\nonumber\\\\ & + & [ 2\\phi_{,r}\\phi_{,z}]\\mathrm{d}z\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to obtain a solution of ( [ eq : lap1])([eq : lap3 ] ) representing a thin disk located at @xmath26 , we assume that the metric functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are continuous across the disk , but have discontinuous first derivatives in the direction normal to the disk .",
    "thin disk solutions in weyl coordinates are functions of the class @xmath27 .",
    "the reflectional symmetry of ( [ eq : lap1 ] ) - ( [ eq : lap3 ] ) with respect to the plane @xmath26 allows us to assume that @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are even functions of @xmath15 .",
    "hence , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are odd functions of @xmath15 .",
    "we shall require that they not vanish on the surfaces @xmath31 .",
    "such impositions can induce e.g. a discontinuity in the space - time by reflecting the solution through the plane .",
    "this represents the construction of the disk using the well known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method that was used by kuzmin @xcite in newtonian gravity and later in gr by many authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the material content of the disk will be described by functions that are distributions with support on the disk .",
    "the method can be divided in the following steps that are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_schem1 ] .",
    "first , in a space wherein we have a compact source of gravitational field , we choose a surface ( in our case , the plane @xmath32 ) that divides the space in two pieces : one with no singularities or sources and the other with the sources .",
    "then we disregard the part of the space with singularities and use the surface to make an inversion of the non - singular part of the space .",
    "this results in a space with a singularity that is a delta function with support on @xmath32 .",
    "this procedure is mathematically equivalent to make the transformation @xmath33 , with @xmath34 constant . in the einstein tensor",
    "we have first and second derivatives of @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the heaviside and dirac distributions , the einstein field equations will separate in two different pieces @xcite : one valid for @xmath39 ( the usual einstein equations ) , and other involving distributions with an associated energy - momentum tensor .",
    "due to the discontinuous behavior of the derivatives of the metric tensor across the disk , the riemann curvature tensor contains dirac delta functions .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be obtained by the distributional approach due to papapetrou and hamouni @xcite , lichnerowicz @xcite , and taub @xcite .",

    "here , @xmath43 .",
    "the disk at @xmath32 divides the space - time into two halves .",
    "the normal to the disk can be described by the co - vector @xmath44 . above the disk near @xmath32",
    ", we can expand the metric as g_ab = g^0_ab + z_z=0+z^2_z=0 + ... , and below @xmath32 , g_ab = g^0_ab + z_z=0+z^2_z=0 + .... the quantity @xmath45 means the value of @xmath46 at @xmath32 .",

    "the method to construct the disk is not new .",
    "actually we used well known general relativistic methods to construct thin disks , including , however , as a novelty , extra dimensions in the geometry of the system . though the presented results introduce important constraints to kaluza - klein theories .",
    "if it is true , maybe it would mean that the world we perceive is only a fraction of a greater invisible reality and maybe the @xmath0 matter is a kind of modulation demanded both by the curvature of @xmath0 space - time and the extradimensional geometry .",
    "two main questions could be formulated about the results of the present paper : i ) do such results bring an alternative to the dark matter conjecture ( showing that the strenght of gravitation may be modified by extra dimensions , which would have similar consequences ) ?",
    "ii ) or do they rather suggest a particular form of dark matter ( consisting in kaluza - klein particles that may result from extra dimensions ) ?",
    "a first observation on this aspect is that modifications in rotation curves come from the possibility that extra dimensions are endowed with dynamical test particles , i.e. , the extra dimensions must contain the presence of fields ( as similar to universal extra dimensions models ) .",
    "( [ cxcy ] ) and ( [ ddr ] ) show that the projection of extra dimensional rates is the determinant factor to obtain a deviation from a newtonian profile",
    ". becomes clear , from secs .",
    "[ solar ] and [ sec : lensing ] , that the effect of extra dimensions is to modify gravity according to the astronomical scale r / m ( distance per mass ) , thus altering the rotation curves and lensing , for instance , in a more rigid framework than that of cdm models . in this sense ,",
    "our model is similar to e.g. mond or teves @xcite , but proposes and demonstrates that modifications of gravity comes naturally from the geometry of a multidimensional universe and that a multidimensional space - time is sensitive to r / m ( distance per mass ) scales .",
    "c .- a . thanks iupap and capes and p.s.l thanks cnpq and fapesp for partial financial support . the authors are also very grateful to prd referees for enlightening views and for suggestions given in order to improve the quality of this paper . +",
    "alternatively , we can also present another interpretation for the nature of the results . one can assume that actually the model is constraining a kaluza - klein dark matter particle ( provenient from ued imprints ) .",
    "see detailed discussions about a such topic in @xcite . and maybe both interpretations ( the pure geometrical approach and the induced kk matter ) , are physically equivalent ( see for instance a idea proposed by clifford in @xcite , where not only could one describe fields through geometry , but also the particles that interact by means of those fields ) . about the particle aspect , although the main purpose of the present work is to construct a top - down model and not to shed light on a fundamental theory we can illustrate considering the possibility that our model could constrain a kaluza - klein dark matter particle to be tested at large hadron collider ( lhc ) in next years . as an example , consider for simplicity that kaluza - klein dark matter particle in universal extra dimensions could be considered as a fundamental particle , where is included also the possibility that a such particle could decay in others .",
    "following @xcite , one can derive a lagrangian from the compactification of the extra dimensions and connect such compactification to the cross section of the particle . using the generic notation @xmath301 for the coordinates of the @xmath302-dimensional space - time ( different from the usual non - compact space - time coordinates , @xmath303 ) , and the coordinates of the extra dimensions , @xmath304 ,",
    "the 4-dimensional lagrangian can be obtained by dimensional reduction from the @xmath302-dimensional theory ,      here @xmath305 are the @xmath302-dimensional gauge field strengths associated with the @xmath306 group , while @xmath307 and @xmath308 are the covariant derivatives , with @xmath309 being the @xmath302-dimensional gauge fields .",
    "the piece @xmath310 of the @xmath302-dimensional lagrangian contains the kinetic term for the @xmath302-dimensional higgs doublet @xmath311 , and the higgs potential .",
    "the @xmath302-dimensional gauge couplings @xmath312 , and the yukawa couplings collected in the @xmath313 matrices @xmath314 , have dimension ( mass)@xmath315 . the fields @xmath316 and @xmath317 describe the @xmath302-dimensional fermions whose zero - modes are given by the 4-dimensional standard model quarks . a summation over a generational index is implicit in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "for example , the 4-dimensional , third generation quarks may be written as @xmath318 .",
    "the kinetic and yukawa terms for the weak - doublet and -singlet leptons , @xmath319 and @xmath320 , are not shown for brevity .",
    "the gamma matrices in @xmath302 dimensions , @xmath321 , are anti - commuting @xmath322 matrices , where @xmath323 is an integer such that @xmath324 or @xmath325 .",
    "chiral fermions exist only when @xmath41 is even , and correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath326 of @xmath327 .",
    "the space - time is described as @xmath328 , where the extra dimensions can be compactified in a @xmath329 tori .",
    "the @xmath2 example of section [ sec:6d ] has a tori of radii @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "asymptotically the compactification tori radius is constant and it is obtained by @xmath332 , and the periodic dimensions @xmath333 , @xmath334 .",
    "the compactification is obtained by imposing the identification of two pairs of adjacent sides of the torus retangle . in a pure ued model",
    "the compactication scale arises simply from the need to produce the right amount of dm . here ,",
    "a modified ued model , the compactification scale arises from the dynamics of galaxies and from clusters lensing .",
    "a detailed investigation about the compactification of the model will be done in future works , although our preliminary results indeed strength the possibility that our model could constrain , as one of the physical interpretations , a kaluza - klein dark matter particle to be tested at large hadron collider ( lhc ) , where the proposed energy range is 114 tev , and the main signals of kk dm will be several @xmath335 resonances .",

    "<S> we find a family of exact solutions of einstein equations describing the field of a static axisymmetric thin disk living in six - dimensional space - time . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the disks constructed ( by cutting out the central part of the space - time ) from the conventional schwarzschild and chazy - curzon solutions with simple extensions in the extra 2 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the disks are interpreted in terms of two counter - rotating streams of particles on free circular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> two extra parameters  the constants of motion resulting from projections of the particle - velocities extra components  are constrained by the requirement that the orbits within the disc be stable . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement is met just in cases when the radial profile of the disc orbital speed fits the rotation curves of many spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it thus turns out that the effective modification of the gravity law by extra dimensions could explain the observed flatness of these curves equally well as the usually given dark matter interpretation . in the second part of the paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inclusion of extra dimensions also leads to better fits of the gravitational lensing data for galaxy clusters , without changing results obtained in solar system scales . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss whether the effect of extra dimensions could also be translated as following from the occurrence of extra matter ( `` kaluza - klein particles '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> a comment on possible properties of such particles and a chance to detect them at lhc is given in the appendix . </S>"
