    "at lep2 , w - pair - mediated four - fermion @xmath5 production was experimentally explored with quite high precision ( see and references therein ) .",
    "the lep2 measurements had set the scale in accuracy in the theoretical predictions for w - pair - mediated @xmath6 production , as reviewed in . for lep2 accuracy , it was sufficient to include corrections in the so - called double - pole approximation ( dpa ) , where only the leading term in an expansion about the poles in the two w - boson propagators is taken into account .",
    "different versions of such a dpa have been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "although several monte carlo programs exist that include universal corrections , only two event generators , yfsww @xcite and racoonww @xcite , include non - universal corrections .    in the dpa approach , the w - pair cross section can be predicted within @xmath7 @xmath8 in the energy range between @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 , which was sufficient for the lep2 accuracy of @xmath12 . in the threshold region ( @xmath13 ) , the dpa is not reliable , and the best available prediction results from an improved born approximation ( iba ) based on leading universal corrections only , and thus possesses an intrinsic uncertainty of @xmath14 .    at a future international @xmath15 linear collider ( ilc )",
    "@xcite , the accuracy of the cross - section measurement will be at the per - mille level , and the precision of the @xmath16-mass determination is expected to be @xmath17 @xcite by direct reconstruction and from a threshold scan of the total w - pair - production cross section @xcite . the theoretical uncertainty ( tu ) for the direct mass reconstruction at lep2 is estimated to be of the order of @xmath18 @xcite to @xmath19 @xcite , based on results of yfsww and racoonww ; theoretical improvements are , thus , desirable for an ilc . for the cross - section prediction at threshold",
    "the tu is @xmath14 , because it is based on an iba , and thus is definitely insufficient for the planned precision measurement of @xmath20 in a threshold scan .",
    "the tu in constraining the anomalous triple - gauge - boson coupling @xmath21 was estimated to be @xmath22 @xcite for the lep2 analysis .",
    "since a future ilc is more sensitive to anomalous gauge - boson couplings than lep2 by more than an order of magnitude , a further reduction of the uncertainties resulting from missing radiative corrections is necessary .",
    "recently we have completed the first @xmath0 calculation ( improved by higher - order isr ) for the @xmath6 final states @xmath23 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , which are relevant for w - pair production .",
    "we have presented results on total cross sections in and on various differential distributions in .",
    "the latter publication also contains technical details of the actual calculation , which is rather complicated . in",
    "so that one can expect that the system will be able to deal with @xmath24 processes at one loop in the near future .",
    "] in the following we briefly describe the salient features of the calculation and present a selection of numerical results that are relevant for a future ilc , comprising total cross sections and some phenomenologically interesting distributions .",
    "the actual calculation builds upon the racoonww approach @xcite , where real - photonic corrections are based on full matrix elements and virtual corrections are treated in dpa .",
    "real and virtual corrections are combined either using two - cutoff phase - space slicing or employing the dipole subtraction method @xcite for photon radiation .",
    "we also include leading - logarithmic isr beyond @xmath4 in the structure - function approach ( and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to the dpa approach , the one - loop calculation of an @xmath24 process requires the evaluation of 5- and 6-point one - loop tensor integrals . for the generic @xmath25 final state , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are different fermions excluding electrons and electron neutrinos and @xmath28 and @xmath29 their isospin partners",
    ", there are 40 hexagon diagrams , 112 pentagon diagrams , and 227 ( 220 ) box diagrams in the conventional t hooft  feynman gauge ( background - field gauge ) .",
    "a survey of feynman diagrams can be found in .",
    "we calculate the 6-point integrals by directly reducing them to six 5-point functions , as described in .",
    "the 5-point integrals are reduced to five 4-point functions following the method of .",
    "note that this reduction of 5- and 6-point integrals to 4-point integrals does not involve inverse gram determinants composed of external momenta , which naturally occur in the passarino ",
    "veltman reduction @xcite of tensor to scalar integrals",
    ". the latter procedure leads to serious numerical problems when the gram determinants become small , which happens usually near the boundary of phase space but can also occur within phase space because of the indefinite minkowski metric .",
    "we use , however , passarino  veltman reduction to calculate tensor integrals up to 4-point functions , which involves inverse gram determinants built from two or three momenta .",
    "this , in fact , leads to numerical instabilities in phase - space regions where these gram determinants become small . for these regions",
    "we have worked out two `` rescue systems '' : one makes use of expansions of the tensor coefficients about the limit of vanishing gram determinants ; in the other , alternative method we numerically evaluate a specific tensor coefficient , the integrand of which is logarithmic in feynman parametrization , and derive the remaining coefficients as well as the scalar integral from it algebraically .",
    "this reduction does not involve inverse gram determinants .",
    "in addition to the evaluation of the one - loop integrals , also the evaluation of the three spinor chains corresponding to the three external fermion ",
    "antifermion pairs is non - trivial , because the chains are contracted with each other and/or with four - momenta in many different ways .",
    "there are @xmath30 different chains to calculate , so that an algebraic reduction to a standard form which involves only very few standard chains is desirable .",
    "we have worked out algorithms that reduce all occurring spinor chains to @xmath31 standard structures without introducing coefficients that lead to numerical problems .",
    "these algorithms are described in in detail .",
    "the description of resonances in ( standard ) perturbation theory requires a dyson summation of self - energy insertions in the resonant propagator in order to introduce the imaginary part provided by the finite decay width into the propagator denominator .",
    "this procedure in general violates gauge invariance , destroys slavnov  taylor or ward identities and disturbs the cancellation of gauge - parameter dependences , because different perturbative orders are mixed ( see , for instance , and references therein ) .",
    "the dpa provides a gauge - invariant answer in terms of an expansion about the resonance , but in the full calculation we are after a unified description that is valid both for resonant and non - resonant regions in phase space , without any matching between different treatments for different regions .",
    "-1    for our calculation we have generalized @xcite the so - called `` complex - mass scheme '' , which was introduced in for lowest - order calculations , to the one - loop level . in this approach the w- and z - boson masses",
    "are consistently considered as complex quantities , defined as the locations of the poles in the complex @xmath32 plane of the corresponding propagators with momentum @xmath33 .",
    "gauge invariance is preserved if the complex masses are introduced everywhere in the feynman rules , in particular , in the definition of the weak mixing angle , which is now derived from the ratio of the complex masses .",
    "the ( algebraic ) relations , such as ward identities , that follow from gauge invariance remain valid , because the gauge - boson masses are modified only by an analytic continuation .",
    "since this continuation already modifies the lowest - order predictions by changing the gauge - boson masses , double - counting of higher - order effects has to be carefully avoided by an appropriate renormalization procedure .",
    "the use of complex gauge - boson masses necessitates the consistent use of these complex masses also in loop integrals . to this end",
    ", we have derived all relevant one - loop integrals with complex internal masses .",
    "the ir - singular integrals were taken from . concerning the non - ir singular cases ,",
    "we have analytically continued the results of for the 2-point and 3-point functions , and the relevant results of for the 4-point functions .",
    "we have checked all these results by independent direct calculation of the feynman - parameter integrals .      in order to prove the reliability of our results ,",
    "we have carried out a number of checks , as described in more detail in .",
    "we have checked the structure of the ( uv , soft , and collinear ) singularities , the matching between virtual and real corrections , and the gauge independence ( by performing the calculation in t  hooft  feynman gauge and in the background - field gauge @xcite ) . the most convincing check for ourselves is the fact that we worked out the whole calculation in two independent ways , resulting in two independent computer codes the results of which are in good agreement .",
    "all algebraic manipulations , including the generation of feynman diagrams , have been done using independent programs .",
    "the amplitudes are generated with feynarts , using the two independent versions 1 and 3 , as described in and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the algebraic manipulations are performed using two independent in - house programs implemented in mathematica , one of which builds upon formcalc  @xcite . for the calculation of the loop integrals we use the two independent in -",
    "house libraries which employ the different calculational methods sketched above for the numerical stabilization .",
    "the precisely defined input for the numerical results presented in the following can be found in .",
    "the respective figures for the relative corrections @xmath34 to the semileptonic and hadronic final states look almost identical , up to an offset resulting from the qcd corrections .",
    "specifically , the upper plots show the absolute prediction for the cross section including the full @xmath4 corrections and improvements from higher - order isr .",
    "the lower plots compare the relative corrections as obtained from the full @xmath4 calculation , from an iba , and from the dpa .",
    "the iba @xcite implemented in racoonww is based on universal corrections only and includes solely the contributions of the cc03 diagrams .",
    "the dpa of racoonww comprises also non - universal corrections @xcite and goes beyond a pure pole approximation in two respects .",
    "the real - photonic corrections are based on the full @xmath35 matrix elements , and the coulomb singularity is included for off - shell w  bosons .",
    "further details can be found in .",
    "a comparison between the dpa and the predictions based on the full @xmath0 corrections reveals differences in the relative corrections @xmath34 of @xmath36 for cm energies ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "this is in agreement with the expected reliability of the dpa , as discussed in . at higher energies , the deviations increase and",
    "reach @xmath39 at @xmath40 . in the threshold region ( @xmath13 ) , as expected , the dpa also becomes worse w.r.t .",
    "the full one - loop calculation , because the naive error estimate of @xmath41 times some numerical safety factor of @xmath42 for the corrections missing in the dpa has to be replaced by @xmath43 in the threshold region and thus becomes large . in view of that",
    ", the dpa is even surprisingly good near threshold . for cm energies below @xmath10",
    "the lep2 cross section analysis was based on approximations like the shown iba , which follows the full one - loop corrections even below the threshold at @xmath44 within an accuracy of about @xmath45 , as expected in .",
    "more results on total cross sections , including numbers on leptonic , semileptonic , and hadronic final states , can be found in .",
    "-1                further distributions , also for @xmath51 , are presented in . for",
    "the invariant - mass distribution the full @xmath4 calculation and the dpa agree within @xmath12 both for lep2 and ilc energies .",
    "for the w - production - angle distribution this is also the case in the lep2 range ( see fig .  12 of ) , but at @xmath52 the difference of the corrections in dpa and the complete @xmath4 corrections rises from @xmath53 to about @xmath54 with increasing scattering angle .",
    "note that such a distortion of the shape of the angular distribution can be a signal for anomalous triple gauge - boson couplings .",
