    "long  time network observations of delta scuti stars resulted in establishing truly multimodal character of oscillations in a few objects of this type .",
    "the four objects with the largest number of modes detected are fg  virginis with 24 modes ( breger et  al .",
    "1997 ) , 4  canum venaticorum with at least 17 modes ( breger 1997 ) , xx  pyxidis with 13 modes ( handler et  al .",
    "1997a ) and bh piscium with 13 modes ( mantegazza et  al .",
    "1996 ) . though these numbers of modes in comparison with the sun or certain oscillating white dwarfs may appear small , reproducing mode frequencies with model calculation represents a challenge .",
    "what makes our task more difficult than in the solar and white  dwarf cases , is the fact that the observed spectra do not reveal patterns enabling mode identification .",
    "modes detected in @xmath1 scuti stars are of low radial order and their frequencies do not obey simple asymptotic relations .",
    "further , these stars are rather rapid rotators and rotational splitting is not equidistant .",
    "multicolor photometry may be used to determine the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath0 .",
    "spectroscopy allows , in addition , to determine the azimuthal order , @xmath2 . in practice , however , reliable @xmath0 and @xmath2 values are only seldom available .",
    "thus , mode identification in @xmath1  scuti stars can not be done independently of calculations involving construction of equilibrium models and their oscillation properties .",
    "the aim is to construct a stellar model with frequencies of low  degree modes which fit the observed ones . in analogy to helioseismology",
    "we use the name _",
    "seismic model_.    the ultimate purpose of seismic model construction is testing the ingredients of stellar evolution theory : its basic assumptions and the input microscopic physics .",
    "stellar evolution theory has reached an advanced level some 20 to 30 years ago . however",
    ", important questions concerning convection and rotation remain unanswered .",
    "for instance , is the mixing ",
    "length theory sufficient for describing convective flux in subphotospheric layers ?",
    "if so , what is the best choice for the mixing length parameter , @xmath3 , depending on stellar parameters ?",
    "what is the extent of element penetration , @xmath4 , from the convective to the radiative regions ? what is the law of the angular momentum evolution ?",
    "what is the role of rotationally induced instabilities in chemical element mixing ?    in recent years considerable progress has been made in treatment of the equation of state and opacity for stellar interiors ( see christensen ",

    "1996 , rogers & iglesias 1994 and references there , iglesias & rogers 1996 , seaton 1996 ) .",
    "the uncertainties , however , are difficult to estimate .",
    "it is therefore important to use possibly diversified sets of observational data for testing .",
    "observers provide us very accurate frequency measurements but a major effort is needed to connect these quantities to other stellar characteristics and to parameters used in model construction .    in the next section we will outline methodology of constructing seismic models , which , we believe , is applicable to all multimode @xmath1  scuti stars in the main sequence phase of evolution . we should stress that our work is not the first effort aimed at reproducing observed frequencies in objects of this type .",
    "goupil et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) modelled gx pegasi for which five frequencies have been measured .",
    "breger et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and guzik and bradley ( 1995 ) constructed models of fg virginis , which approximately reproduced observations .",
    "our target accuracy is much higher  we want to approach the level of the observational error .",
    "the rest of this paper concerns xx  pyxidis ( cd24  7599 ) , which seemed to be a good choice for the first attempt in accurate reproducing observed spectrum . amongst most multimode @xmath1  scuti stars",
    "it is the hottest and least evolved . in such stars the predicted spectrum of unstable modes is relatively simple . with the progress of stellar evolution the instability extends to mode of mixed pressure / gravity ( p / g ) character and to pure g ",
    ". separations in frequency between modes of the same @xmath5 decrease , which complicates mode identifcation .",
    "in post main sequence stars the density of predicted spectra is so high that the task of mode identification will remain impossible unless we discover the clue to mode selection .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty in the description of the subphotosperic convection is less severe in this relatively hot star .    after presenting data in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss in section 4 constraints on mean parameters of the star .",
    "the methodology of the simultaneous search for mode identification and refinement of model parameters is described in section 5 .",
    "in the same section several alternative solutions are presented . in section 6",
    "we explain why these are unreliable and in the last section we discuss prospects for construction of a still improved seismic model of the star .",
    "the number of modes detected in individual @xmath1  scuti stars is far too small to attempt to determine radial structure directly from measured frequencies .",
    "everything we may hope to achieve is to use the observed frequencies to determine global parameters characterizing the star and certain parameters of the theory .",
    "the equations of problem are obtained by equating observed and calculated frequencies ,    @xmath6    where @xmath7 labels measured frequencies , @xmath8 are numbers identifying the mode , @xmath9 gives the set parameters characterizing the model , and @xmath10 gives the set of free parameters of the theory .",
    "a comment is needed about @xmath11 .",
    "nonradial modes excited in @xmath1  scuti stars could be p  modes , g ",
    "modes , and modes of mixed character . in the present application , continuity of @xmath12 as function of @xmath13 for specified",
    "@xmath14 is essential .",
    "the avoided crossing effect causes that the continuity is guaranteed if we define the @xmath15 values at zams where the g and p  mode spectra are separated in frequency .",
    "following unno et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) we will denote with @xmath16 and @xmath17 modes which in zams models are consecutive g and p  modes , respectively .",
    "for @xmath18 there is the fundamental mode which is denoted with @xmath19 . with this choice , in evolved models some of modes denoted with @xmath17 will have predominatly g  mode properties and _ vice versa_.    the parameters given by @xmath20 are those characterizing the evolutionary sequence like initial mass @xmath21 , chemical composition , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the angular momentum .",
    "in addition , there is a single parameter identifying the model within the evolutionary sequence .",
    "the age is always a good choice . in the present application we use the initial equatorial velocity @xmath24 instead of the angular momentum and @xmath25 instead of the age .",
    "the latter choice is acceptable because xx  pyx is certainly in the expansion phase of the main sequence evolution and @xmath26 is a monotonic function of the age . in any case",
    "there are five parameters in @xmath20 .",
    "the quantities one may include in @xmath27 are mixing ",
    "length parameter @xmath3 , overshooting distance @xmath4 , as well as parameters characterizing angular momentum evolution and mass loss .",
    "none of these will be included in the present work .",
    "constraining these parameters is certainly the most important application of asteroseismology .",
    "however , as we will see later in this paper , we are not yet at this stage .",
    "stellar evolution code we use was developed in its original version by b. paczyski , r. sienkiewicz and m. kozowski .",
    "it is in fact a modern version of b. paczyski s code ( paczyski 1969 , 1970 ) , which is now written in a modular form enabling an easy implementation of microscopic physics data from various sources . in the present application we use most recent versions of opal opacity ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) and equation of state ( rogers et  al .",
    "1996 ) data .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates are the same as used by bahcall and pinsonneault ( 1995 ) .",
    "the effect of averaged centrifugal force is taken into account in the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we assume uniform rotation and conservation of global angular momentum .",
    "these are the simplest assumptions which we are prepared to abandon if this is required for a successful seismic model construction .",
    "similarily , we are prepared to introduce overshooting and/or rotationally induced mixing of the chemical elements outside of the convective core , but these effects are ignored in the present work . with these assumptions",
    "the input parameters for sequences are total mass , @xmath21 , initial values for hydrogen abundance , @xmath22 , metal abundance , @xmath23 , and the equatorial velocity @xmath24 .",
    "initial heavy element mixture is that of grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "the assumed parameters for convection are @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the choice of @xmath3 is unimportant in the present application .    for selected values of @xmath26 the code returns all needed parameters of the model such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 and the matrix of the coefficients needed for calculation of linear nonadiabatic oscillation properties .",
    "the code we use is a modified version of the code developed long ago by one of us ( dziembowski 1977 ) .",
    "the important modification is taking into account the effect of the averaged centrifugal force .",
    "modified equations for adiabatic oscillations are given by soufi et  al .",
    "the corresponding change in the full nonadiabatic set is trivial .",
    "the input to this code specifies the range of frequencies and the maximum value of @xmath0 .",
    "the standard output are the following characteristics of the @xmath33 modes : complex dimensionless frequencies @xmath34 , modified growth rates , @xmath35 , and the complex ratio of the flux to displacement eigenfunctions at the surface , @xmath36 .",
    "the frequency , @xmath12 , which we compare with observations is given by the real part of @xmath34 :    @xmath37    for higher order p  modes beginning with , say , @xmath38 or 6 ,",
    "the nonadiabatic effects are important at the level of the accuracy of frequency measurements .",
    "the growth rate is given by @xmath39 .",
    "a more convenient measure of mode stability is @xmath35 which varies from @xmath40 , if damping occurs in the stellar interior , to @xmath41 , if driving occurs everywhere . at neutral stability",
    "we have @xmath42 .",
    "values of @xmath35 are important as constraints on modes and models .",
    "we will use them in the next sections .",
    "also @xmath36 s have applications in asteroseismology , especially , in determination of @xmath0values ( see cugier et  al .",
    "1994 ) . however , we do not have neccesary observational data on xx  pyx to make use of this quantity .",
    "rotation has an important effect on the structure of oscillation spectra . even at modest equatorial velocities such as 50100 km",
    "/ s the effect of rotation can not be reduced to the linear splitting @xmath43 .",
    "our code calculating the rotational splitting is accurate up to @xmath44 .",
    "it is a version of the code by dziembowski and goode ( 1992 ) modified by two of us ( wad , aap ) and m.j .",
    "it uses the adiabatic approximation . the same nonadiabatic correction evaluated with",
    "the the code described in the previous subsection is added to all modes within the multiplet .",
    "more than 350 hours of time ",
    "series photometric observations of xx  pyx are available .",
    "these include two whole earth telescope runs ( handler et al .",
    "1996 , 1997a ) as well as follow  up measurements to study the star s amplitude and frequency variations ( handler et  al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "analysis of the two wet data sets allowed the extraction of 13 pulsation frequencies plus one 2f  harmonic .",
    "these frequencies are summarized in table  [ freqobs ] , and mostly taken from handler et  al .",
    "( 1997a , hereafter hpo ) .",
    "moreover , from an examination of the follow  up data , the values of frequencies @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 could be refined .",
    "the three revised frequencies are also listed in table  [ freqobs ] .",
    "their error sizes differ from those listed in hpo , since these frequencies are now known without alias ambiguity",
    ". however , these three frequencies are slightly variable ( handler et  al .",
    "therefore the error bars have been modified to account for the latter effect .",
    ".frequencies of the 13 pulsation modes and the @xmath48harmonic of the @xmath1  scuti star xx  pyx unambiguously detected by hpo [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "clearly , we have not succeeded in constructing the seismic model of xx  pyx .",
    "models regarded as plausible , such as those in fig",
    ".  [ fig05 ] , do not reproduce the frequencies within the observational errors .",
    "in fact , we are quite far from the @xmath49 c / d error range seen in table  [ freqobs ] .",
    "the departures from the fit for some of the identifications are in fact easily visible in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] .",
    "the problem proved more difficult than we have anticipated .",
    "we believe that we learned something in the process and that this knowledge should be shared with other groups undertaking similar efforts .",
    "undoubtedly , an improvement of the fits could be accomplished by allowing adjustment of the chemical composition parameters . the overshooting distance and parameters in the radial dependence of rotation rate",
    "should also be regarded as adjustable quantities .",
    "these degrees of freedom affect primarily the positions of the mixed modes relative to pure p  modes . in this application",
    "the mixed modes exist for @xmath50 at the low frequency end .",
    "such modes extend to higher frequencies for higher @xmath0 s .",
    "however , the freedom allows also a fine tuning of the distances between pure p  modes .",
    "one could hope that there is just one mode identification and one corresponding model of the star for which the frequency fit within the measurement errors is possible .",
    "the reason why we can not yet proceed this way is that our treatment of rotation is not adequate .",
    "we used here a perturbation theory which is accurate up to some 0.05 c / d , much worse than the measurement accuracy .",
    "we are not yet sure that the recently developed cubic theory ( soufi et  al .",
    "1997 ) would yield a sufficient accuracy .",
    "observational determination of the @xmath0 values for some of the excited modes could significantly change the situation .",
    "imagine , for instance , that we find that the photometric data place the @xmath45 mode into the @xmath51 domain of an _ amplitude ratio  phase difference _ diagram ( see watson 1988 , garrido et  al . 1990 ) .",
    "we may see in table  [ freqobs ] that this mode has far the highest amplitude and certainly it will be the first for which we will have the required data . as we have discussed in section 6 , the possibility that this is not a @xmath51 mode but rather a @xmath52 mode must be considered .",
    "fortunately , we do not see such an identification for @xmath45 in table [ ident ] .",
    "thus , we are left with only two models , d4a and d4b , with very similar parameters and the same identification for almost all modes excited in xx  pyx .",
    "we could discriminate between the two if we knew @xmath0 for @xmath53 which is the only mode with different identification .",
    "if , however , the @xmath45 position in the diagram corresponds to an @xmath54 domain , we are less lucky . the possible models are not only six models with @xmath54 for @xmath45 but also models d4a and d4b with @xmath51 because radial modes contaminated with a @xmath50 component may appear in the @xmath54 domain .",
    "the ambiguity implies a wide range of admissible model parameters .",
