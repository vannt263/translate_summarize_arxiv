    "understanding frictional sliding is a long - standing challenge with important practical and theoretical implications .",
    "it is relevant in diverse physical systems spanning a broad range of scales , from the nano - scale to the planetary - scale .",
    "a complete analytic treatment of sliding frictional interfaces is generally a formidable task .",
    "two major factors are responsible for the complexity of the problem .",
    "first , the friction law , i.e.  the constitutive relation that describes the shear traction at the frictional interface , poses experimental challenges and depends on the slip rate and slip history in a highly nonlinear fashion  @xcite .",
    "the second factor is the elastodynamics of the sliding bodies , i.e.  the time - dependent long - range stress transfer mechanisms between different points along the interface .",
    "it is particularly challenging when the two bodies are made of different materials and in the generic case in which spontaneously - generated interfacial rupture fronts dynamically propagate along the interface  @xcite .",
    "a significant simplification in relation to the second factor is obtained when the system possesses reflection symmetry across the interface , i.e.  when the two materials are identical , the geometry is symmetric , and the loading configuration is antisymmetric ( here and elsewhere we consider macroscopic geometry .",
    "differences in small - scale roughness typically exist and are effectively incorporated into the interfacial constitutive relation ) .",
    "a prototypical example of such a situation is that of two semi - infinite half - spaces made of identical elastic materials , a situation that was extensively studied in the literature ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the main simplification comes from the fact that such a symmetry precludes a coupling between tangential slip and variations in the normal stress .",
    "the lack of such symmetry has important implications on the stability of sliding  @xcite , the failure mechanism and rupture directionality  @xcite .",
    "physically , this happens because sliding can enhance ( reduce ) the normal stress , which in turn can inhibit ( facilitate ) frictional sliding .",
    "sliding atop a semi - infinite bulk .",
    "sliding occurs in the @xmath0-direction .",
    "( c ) an idealized schematic geometry of tectonic subduction motion . ]",
    "the origin of the absence of reflection symmetry is traditionally assumed to be constitutive in nature , i.e.  sliding of dissimilar materials is usually considered .",
    "this is known as the bi - material effect .",
    "sliding along such bi - material interfaces has been quite extensively studied in the literature and this material contrast is thought to have important implications for frictional dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of asymmetry of a geometric origin , i.e.  sliding of two bodies made of the same material without geometrical reflection symmetry .",
    "examples of such geometries are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometries ] : sliding of two blocks with different thickness in the direction orthogonal to sliding , an experimental setup that was used in various recent works  @xcite and will be theoretically addressed below ( panel a ) ; sliding of a block of finite height @xmath1 over a semi - infinite bulk , a simple example to be analyzed in depth in this work ( panel b ) ; finally , an idealized sketch of tectonic subduction motion is shown ( panel c ) , a situation in which one lithospheric plate is subducted beneath another one and is responsible for most of the large magnitude earthquakes ( `` megathrust '' ) occurring on the earth s crust  ( * ? ? ?",

    "obviously , many other sliding geometries which lack reflection symmetry can be conceived . generally speaking",
    ", this situation is expected to be the rule rather than the exception , since no physical system features perfect reflection symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we lay out a rather general theoretical framework to address frictional sliding in the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry and support it by extensive experiments .",
    "a major outcome is that the effect of geometric asymmetry resembles , sometimes qualitatively and sometimes semi - quantitatively , that of material asymmetry .",
    "consequently , many results obtained for bi - material interfaces are also relevant to interfaces separating bodies made of identical materials with different geometry .",
    "as first applications , two main results are obtained within the newly developed framework :    * a novel explanation of a sizable weakening effect observed in recent experiments on rupture fronts propagation along frictional interfaces  @xcite .",
    "the weakening effect is directly linked to geometric asymmetry and is shown experimentally to disappear in its absence .",
    "this result has important implications for the failure dynamics of frictional interfaces .",
    "* we demonstrate that geometric asymmetry can destabilize frictional sliding which is otherwise stable .",
    "we consequently expect geometric asymmetry to play an important role in frictional instabilities .",
    "the emerging framework should find additional applications in a broad range of frictional systems .",
    "consider two blocks in frictional contact . at this stage ,",
    "the discussion remains completely general , allowing the two blocks to be made of different materials , to feature different geometries and to experience general external loadings .",
    "we denote the displacement vector fields in the two blocks as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the superscripts correspond to the upper and lower blocks , respectively .",
    "each of these satisfies the momentum balance equation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass density of each block .",
    "cauchy s stress tensor @xmath6 is related to the displacement gradient tensor @xmath7 according to the isotropic hooke s law @xmath8\\!=\\!{\\bm \\sigma}-\\nu({\\bm",
    "i}{\\operatorname{tr}}{\\bm \\sigma}-{\\bm \\sigma})$ ] . here",
    "@xmath9 is the identity tensor , @xmath10 is poisson s ratio and @xmath11 is the shear modulus of each block .",
    "the coordinates are chosen such that the interface lies along the @xmath0-axis , which is also the direction of sliding , see  fig .",
    "[ fig : geometries ] .",
    "the direction normal to the interface is the @xmath12-axis and the interface is the surface @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14-axis is in the thickness direction , where @xmath15 is the center line . while the formulation below and the analysis in sect .",
    "[ sec : stability ] are two - dimensional ( 2d ) , we shall see that three - dimensional ( 3d ) effects involving the @xmath14-coordinate play an important role in sect .",
    "[ sec : thin - on - thick ] .",
    "since the bulk equations are linear , one can analyze separately each interfacial fourier mode , i.e.  write @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the complex phase / propagation velocity and @xmath19 .",
    "the relation between the interfacial displacements and stresses is also linear and can be written as @xmath20 , where the matrix @xmath21 can be obtained from the green s function of the corresponding medium and @xmath22 are the interfacial stresses , i.e.  at @xmath23 .",
    "for example , under quasi - static conditions for semi - infinite blocks in 2d , this relation for the lower block ( i.e. the block at @xmath24 ) takes the form  @xcite @xmath25    the essence of frictional motion is that the displacement field is discontinuous across the interface .",
    "we denote the slip discontinuity at the frictional interface by @xmath26 on the interface , @xmath13 , no separation or inter - penetration between the bulks implies @xmath27 and continuity of @xmath28 . together with the known dynamic response",
    "matrices @xmath21 , these requirements can be used to calculate the relation between the slip discontinuity and the interfacial stresses of the composite system that consists of both bulks . following  @xcite ,",
    "this is done by noting that for @xmath13 we have @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the response of the composite system in 2d reads ( in fourier space ) @xmath30 where we defined the elastic response functions @xmath31  and  @xmath32 .",
    "that is , the @xmath33 s can be expressed as functions of the response coefficients of both bulks .",
    "note that the imaginary unit @xmath34 is included in eq .   for convenience .",
    "note also that we use the same notation for a function and its fourier transform , as they are easily distinguishable by the context or the stated arguments ( e.g. @xmath35 or @xmath0 ) .",
    "the central player in the analysis to follow is @xmath36 , which represents the elastodynamic coupling between tangential slip and normal traction along the interface . in systems with complete reflection symmetry along @xmath23 ,",
    "this coupling is precluded by symmetry . to see this",
    ", note that in this case the off - diagonal elements of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are identical  @xcite , and thus @xmath39 , as well as its inverse , is diagonal .",
    "this immediately implies @xmath40 . in what follows ,",
    "we study two important frictional problems in which the sliding bodies are made of _ identical materials _ ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , yet reflection symmetry relative to the interface is absent due to asymmetry in the _ geometry _ of the bodies , leading to @xmath44 .",
    "these problems highlight the importance of geometrical asymmetry to frictional sliding and its relation to the conventional bi - material effect .",
    "the first problem that we examine , which is directly motivated by recent experimental observations  @xcite , is depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : geometries]a . in this system ,",
    "a thin block of width @xmath45 mm is pushed along its length ( the @xmath0-axis ) on top of a significantly thicker block ( here @xmath46 mm ) .",
    "this `` thin - on - thick '' experimental setup was used in various studies  @xcite , where a transparent glassy polymer ( poly(methyl - methacrylate ) , pmma ) was used .",
    "the transparent material allows a direct real - time visualization and quantification of a fundamental interfacial quantity : the real contact area , @xmath47 .",
    "the latter is the sum over isolated micro - contacts formed due to the small scale roughness of macroscopic surfaces .",
    "@xmath47 is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the nominal contact area , @xmath48 .",
    "their ratio , @xmath49 , plays a critical role in interfacial dynamics  @xcite because the frictional resistance / stress is proportional to @xmath50 , @xmath51 , i.e.  the larger the real contact area the larger the frictional resistance .",
    "@xmath50 itself depends on the normal stress and also on the slip history of the interface according to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an internal variable characterizing the state of the interface .",
    "frictional sliding leads to reduction of @xmath53 , i.e.  to a reduction of the contact area  @xcite . in the absence of sliding , @xmath53 ( and hence @xmath50 ) grows logarithmically with time , a process known as frictional aging  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite it was found that sliding is mediated by a succession of crack - like rupture fronts propagating along the frictional interface and that these fronts are surprisingly well described by the classical theory of shear cracks propagating along an interface separating identical materials , linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath50 along a few of these fronts is shown here in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]a .",
    "it is seen that the rupture fronts involve a significant overall reduction of the contact area , which weakens the interface ( i.e.  reduces @xmath53 ) and facilitates sliding .",
    "we would like to focus our attention on a distinct feature of these curves : as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]a , fronts which travel at 90% of the rayleigh wave - speed @xmath54 , here @xmath55 m / s ( for plane - stress conditions  @xcite ) , or slower ( not shown ) , feature a monotonic decrease of @xmath50 .",
    "however , in fronts propagating even closer to @xmath54 , @xmath50 features a non - monotonic behavior , i.e.  @xmath50 undershoots the asymptotic value @xmath56 ( i.e.  @xmath50 as @xmath57 ) and then rapidly increases , at a rate way too high to be explained by slow frictional aging .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior remained unexplained in  @xcite , where it was stated that `` the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath50 ... suggests interesting dynamics as @xmath58 ... '' .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]b we show the spatial profiles of the slip velocity @xmath59 , corresponding to the contact area profiles shown in fig .  [ fig : experimental]a .",
    "these profiles were calculated from the experimental data using the simplest cohesive zone model  @xcite which is consistent with the measurements of the fracture energy and cohesive zone size ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this model , while generally used to describe identical materials , is motivated by the empirical observation  @xcite that the strain fields are , to first order , quite similar in the thin - on - thin and thin - on - thick setups .",
    "this approximation would , of course , have to be modified in cases of strong material contrast , where the fields on both sides of the interface differ strongly  @xcite .",
    "we denote the maximum slip velocity in these profiles by @xmath60 .",
    "next , in order to quantify the non - monotonic effect , we define the magnitude of the undershoot @xmath61 as the difference between the asymptotic value @xmath56 and the minimum of the profile over the range @xmath62 , which is the typical spatial range for which @xmath63 is observed in the thin - on - thick setup , see fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]a .",
    "@xmath64 is plotted vs.  @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]c ( red symbols ) , demonstrating that the former is quasi - linear ( i.e.  predominantly linear ) in the latter .",
    "note that the spread in the data does not allow to identify any systematic deviations from linearity .",
    "we stress that the effect is not only qualitatively novel , i.e.  the existence of a non - monotonic contact area behavior @xmath65 , but it is also quantitatively important . as fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]c shows , the local _ reduction _ in the real contact area @xmath64 can reach nearly 25% .",
    "this is a large quantitative effect , compared to other documented frictional effects , implying the existence of significant local frictional _ weakening _ which can significantly influence interfacial dynamics .",
    "what is the source of this non - monotonicity , why does it scale quasi - linearly with the slip velocity and why does it appear only at sonic propagation velocities ? such behavior has recently been observed in  @xcite when investigating the frictional motion of bi - material interfaces in a geometrically symmetric system . there , a very large local reduction of @xmath50 was observed at sonic propagation velocities , but it entirely disappeared when the upper and lower blocks were made of the same material .",
    "we propose that the same happens in our case , only here it is due to geometric asymmetry .",
    "that is , we suggest that the non - monotonicity of @xmath50 stems from the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry of the two blocks , i.e.  from the difference in their thickness .",
    "if true , then the fast non - monotonic variation of @xmath50 is not an intrinsically frictional phenomenon , i.e.  a result of the dynamics of the state of the interface @xmath53 , but rather an elastodynamic effect emerging from the coupling between slip and normal stress variations , solely induced by geometrical effects . in terms of eq .  , we propose that @xmath53 is monotonic and that the non - monotonicity of @xmath50 results from a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath66 .",
    "our strategy in testing and exploring this idea is two - fold .",
    "first , our idea can be directly tested by a definitive experiment .",
    "that is , we expect that when the width of the lower block equals that of the upper one , i.e.  in a `` thin - on - thin '' setup , the non - monotonicity in @xmath50 disappears altogether even in the limit @xmath58 .",
    "we performed this experiment , as in  @xcite , and present a representative example ( for @xmath67 ) in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]c ( blue line ) .",
    "the curve is indeed monotonic .",
    "moreover , note that the asymptotic value @xmath56 is the same as that in the `` thin - on - thick '' setup ( cf .",
    "[ fig : geometries]a , for the same propagation velocity ) , even though the latter exhibits a large undershoot . in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]c ( main panel ) we added @xmath64 of many rupture fronts in the `` thin - on - thin '' setup ( blue symbols ) .",
    "@xmath64 is indeed very close to zero ( small negative values simply correspond to monotonic behavior ) , i.e.  all of the @xmath50 profiles in the `` thin - on - thin '' setup are monotonic .",
    "this direct experimental evidence provides unquestionable support of our basic idea that the non - monotonic behavior corresponding to the `` thin - on - thick '' setup data in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]a emerge from the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry .",
    "next , our aim is to develop a theoretical understanding of the origin of non - monotonicity .",
    "the challenge is to explain both the fact that it emerges at asymptotic propagation velocities ( @xmath58 ) and the quasi - linear relation between @xmath64 and @xmath60 .",
    "the complete problem , involving a thin block sliding atop a thicker one , is a very complicated 3d elastodynamic problem .",
    "we approach the problem by breaking it into two steps .",
    "first , we perform a simplified analysis , invoking physically - motivated approximations , which allow us to reduce the mathematical complexity of the problem and gain analytic insight into it .",
    "the major simplification is to consider the corresponding quasi - static problem instead of the full elastodynamic one .",
    "the physical rationale for this is clear : the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry should manifest its generic implications also in the framework of static elasticity and hence the simplified analysis is expected to reveal the origin of the non - monotonicity of the real contact area .",
    "then , in the second step , we use the static results in an effective dynamic calculation , to be explained below .",
    "the main outcome of the first step is that the static 3d problem can be approximately mapped onto a 2d problem involving two elastically _ dissimilar _ materials .",
    "that is , we show that the _ geometric _ asymmetry can be approximately mapped onto an effective _ constitutive _ asymmetry , i.e.  an effective _ material contrast_. to see how this emerges , we assume that both blocks are infinite in the @xmath12-direction and that the thicker ( lower ) block is also infinite in the @xmath14 direction . that is , the lower block is replaced by a semi - infinite 3d half - space , which allows us to use the well - known interfacial green s function  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the 3d real - space green s function matrix @xmath68  @xcite allows us to express the interfacial displacements at a point @xmath69 on the symmetry line , @xmath70 , induced by a point force applied by the upper block at @xmath71 , @xmath72 . note that the latter is assumed not to contain an out - of - plane component , i.e.  @xmath73 , which in principle could emerge from frustrated poisson expansion at the interface .",
    "it is reasonable , though , to neglect it to leading order .",
    "we physically expect shear tractions to be uniform across the thickness @xmath74 , hence they are taken to be constant for @xmath75 ( and of course to vanish for @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath77 where the effective 2d response matrix @xmath78 of the thicker ( lower ) block is given by the fourier transform of @xmath79 over the strip @xmath75 , @xmath80 the integration can be carried out , resulting in @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order @xmath85 ) .",
    "the outcome of the analysis , which is presented in full detail in  @xcite , is that @xmath78 appears to identify with the 2d response matrix of eq .",
    ", if one defines the effective elastic moduli of the lower ( thicker ) block as @xmath86 these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : analytical]a .    the mapping of the 3d problem onto an effective 2d problem is formally valid as long as the interfacial stresses ( and hence displacements ) in eq .",
    "are approximately localized in fourier @xmath35-space . otherwise , eq .",
    "will not identify with eq .   due to the extra @xmath35-dependence of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which is a result of the 3d nature of the original problem .",
    "we note in passing that in the limit @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which corresponds to 2d plane - strain conditions  @xcite .",
    "this is expected for small wavelengths , for which the thinner block also appears infinitely thick , and hence is a consistency check on our calculation .",
    "the important observation , though , as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : analytical]a , is that for the thicker block @xmath92 for all experimentally relevant @xmath35 s  , @xmath93 becomes minutely smaller than @xmath11 , see  @xcite ] .",
    "this suggests that the thicker block is effectively stiffer than the thinner one , as hypothesized in  @xcite where the thicker block was assumed to correspond to plane - strain conditions in numerical simulations .",
    "that is , the main physical insight gained from the performed analysis is that geometric asymmetry gives rise to an effective material contrast .    with this physical insight in hand , we aim now at addressing the non - monotonicity of @xmath50 discussed in panels a and c of fig .  [",
    "fig : experimental ] . the 3d static analysis presented above",
    "may not yield quantitatively accurate predictions when strongly elastodynamic 2d interfacial rupture fronts are considered .",
    "yet , we believe that the insight embodied in the relations @xmath92 and @xmath94 is physically robust and hence try to explore their quantitative implications in relation to the experimental observations in the dynamic regime .    to accomplish this , we consider the 2d dynamic transfer function @xmath95 in eq .   and take it to approximately describe the experimental system when the effective moduli @xmath92 and @xmath94 are used for the thicker ( lower ) block and plane - stress conditions  @xcite are assumed for the thinner ( upper ) block .",
    "note that it is justified to treat the heights of the two blocks as infinite since the experimental rupture fronts are so fast that they do not interact with the upper and lower boundaries before traversing the whole system .",
    "therefore , eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath96 v \\ ,",
    "\\label{eq : dsigma}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath97 for a constant propagation velocity @xmath18 .",
    "the 2d infinite - system dynamic transfer function @xmath98 in eq .   was calculated by weertman for sliding of dissimilar materials quite some time ago  @xcite .",
    "we reiterate that the basic idea here is to use a known result for dissimilar materials to represent a system composed of identical materials with geometric asymmetry , utilizing the effective moduli derived in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath94 . in the presence of any contrast between the shear moduli of the materials",
    ", @xmath99 is finite and increases significantly at elastodynamic velocities ( in fact , it diverges when @xmath18 approaches the shear wave - speed @xmath100 of the more compliant material ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : analytical]b .",
    "thus , we expect rupture fronts that propagate at near - sonic velocities to be accompanied by a significant reduction in the local normal stress as implied by eq .  , reducing locally the real contact area . in turn",
    ", this reduces the interfacial strength , which facilitates sliding .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observations of fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]a , where the non - monotonicity of @xmath50 becomes substantial at asymptotic propagation velocities ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this normal stress reduction is also remarkably similar to the recent observations of  @xcite in bi - material systems , a similarity that further strengthens the analogy between geometric asymmetry and material asymmetry .",
    "the connection between geometric and material asymmetries is yet further strengthened when the directionality of rupture is considered .",
    "the sub - rayleigh ( @xmath101 ) rupture fronts , shown in fig .",

    "sub - rayleigh rupture fronts that are accompanied by normal stress reduction are known to propagate in the direction of sliding of the more _ compliant _ material in a bi - material setup , the so - called `` preferred direction ''  @xcite .",
    "this is fully consistent with our result that the thinner ( upper ) block is effectively softer than the thicker ( lower ) block ( or alternatively , that the thicker block is effectively stiffer than the thinner one ) .",
    "the quasi - linearity of @xmath61 with the ( maximal ) slip velocity , observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental]c , naturally emerges from eq .  .",
    "to see this , note that @xmath102 according to eq .",
    "( recall that @xmath53 in that equation is expected to be monotonic ) and that @xmath18 remains close to @xmath54 to within a few percent . in this regime ( @xmath103 ) , @xmath36 does not change appreciably as a function of @xmath18 , while the maximal @xmath59 varies quite substantially ( cf .",
    "[ fig : experimental]a ) .",

    "the results presented in this section demonstrate that global geometric features of the sliding bodies in a frictional problem , here a difference in their thickness , affect the frictional resistance to sliding and in fact makes it easier for interfacial rupture fronts that mediate sliding to propagate .",
    "in fact , the effect of geometric asymmetry is maximal at the extreme rupture velocities that are the norm in frictional sliding .",
    "this reduction in frictional dissipation applies to any engineering or tribological system involving identical materials and geometric asymmetry . as such",

    "our major goal here is to understand the destabilizing effect associated with geometric asymmetry , i.e.  @xmath129 , which to the best of knowledge has not been studied before .",
    "consequently , in order to isolate the geometric effect , we will focus below on situations in which friction is intrinsically stabilizing such that any instability , if exists , is associated with the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry .    to achieve this",
    ", we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : simplified ] , we present a simplified analysis involving a simple velocity - dependent friction law and strong geometrical asymmetry .",
    "this will allow us to gain much insight into the role of geometric asymmetry in frictional sliding and to clearly identify the physical origin of instability .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : rsf ]",
    ", we present a significantly generalized analysis for a realistic friction law , including an internal state variable and an interfacial memory length , and for any level of geometric asymmetry .",
    "the emerging results strengthen the findings of sec .",
    "[ sec : simplified ] and extend them .      as a primer",
    ", we use here a simple friction law where @xmath128 in eq .",
    "depends only on the interfacial slip velocity @xmath130 , i.e.  @xmath131 .",
    "we focus on velocity - strengthening interfaces , @xmath132 , because in this case sliding is unconditionally stable for symmetric systems  @xcite and thus the origin of any emerging instability must be associated with the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry . moreover ,",
    "steady state velocity - strengthening friction has been recently shown to be a generic feature of dry interfaces over some velocity range  @xcite .",
    "finally , to simplify the analysis further we consider the case in which the lower block is much higher than the upper one , @xmath133 .",
    "that is , we take the limit @xmath134 , such that @xmath135 is the only lengthscale in the problem .        under what conditions",
    "is homogeneous sliding stable ?",
    "this question , which is of fundamental importance in a broad range of frictional problems ( see , for example  @xcite ) , is first investigated in the context of the simplified problem defined above . as the interface is characterized by velocity - strengthening friction , @xmath132 , friction itself tends to _ stabilize _ sliding .",
    "consequently , the only possible destabilizing piece of physics can be the geometric - asymmetry - induced coupling between interfacial slip and normal stress variations , encapsulated in the function @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) , which also played a crucial role in sect .",
    "[ sec : thin - on - thick ] .",
    "can geometric asymmetry destabilize velocity - strengthening frictional interfaces in much the same way as material asymmetry ( the bi - material effect ) can  @xcite ?    to address the stability question ,",
    "we perturb eq .   to linear order , obtaining  @xcite @xmath136 which is an implicit equation defining the linear stability spectrum @xmath137 . in the simple velocity - dependent friction case considered here , we have @xmath138 ( more general interfacial constitutive laws are considered in sect .  [",
    "sec : rsf ] ) .",
    "perturbations with @xmath139\\!>\\!0 $ ] are unstable and will grow exponentially , while perturbations with @xmath139\\!<\\!0 $ ] are stable ( remember that @xmath17 ) .",
    "an explicit calculation shows that @xmath36 reads  @xcite @xmath140 where @xmath100 and @xmath141 are respectively the shear and dilatational wave - speeds and @xmath142 was introduced .",
    "the limit @xmath143 amounts to a symmetric system , in which case @xmath144 , and indeed @xmath36 vanishes in this limit .",
    "we can thus expect the system to be unconditionally stable for @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath36 also vanishes in the limit @xmath145 .",
    "similarly , @xmath146 takes the form  @xcite @xmath147    equipped with the results for the dynamic response functions @xmath148 , the implicit equation for the spectrum , eq .",
    ", can be in principle solved , at least numerically .",
    "the equation admits a few solution branches , and in general its analysis is far from trivial .",
    "however , since the purpose of the present discussion is not a complete analysis of eq .  ,",
    "but rather a demonstration of the qualitative effect of the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry , we focus here on a particular branch of solutions which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a .",
    "it is observed that for a range of parameters , and for a finite range of wavenumbers , the solutions are unstable ( @xmath139\\!>\\!0 $ ] ) .",
    "this is a direct numerical evidence that geometric asymmetry can destabilize systems which are otherwise stable ( remember that @xmath132 ) .",
    "it seems natural at this point to ask under what conditions this instability is observed .",
    "what are the conditions on the various system parameters such that there will be a range of @xmath35 s for which @xmath149\\!>\\!0 $ ] ? as a prelude , we perform a dimensional analysis . clearly , the only lengthscale in the problem is @xmath1 and indeed the wavenumber @xmath35 only appears in the dimensionless combination @xmath150 .",
    "thus , large ( small ) @xmath35 is equivalent to large ( small ) @xmath1 and since @xmath36 vanishes in both limits @xmath145 and @xmath143 , we expect to find unstable modes only in a finite range @xmath151 , if any .",
    "another dimensionless combination is @xmath152 , which is the ratio of the elastodynamic quantity @xmath153  proportional to the so - called radiation damping factor for sliding  @xcite  and the response of the frictional stress to variations in the sliding velocity . as such",
    ", @xmath154 quantifies the importance of elastodynamics , which tends to destablize sliding when geometrical asymmetry is present , relative to velocity - strengthening friction , which generically stabilizes sliding .",
    "we thus expect large @xmath154 to promote instability , if @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath36 is the only possible source of instability in the problem , the appearance of @xmath155 is associated with destabilization ( because @xmath156 and @xmath36 enter the spectrum in eq .   only through the combination @xmath155 ) . finally , the ratio of the two wave - speeds @xmath157 is also a dimensionless parameter of the system which depends only on the bulk poisson s ratio .    to obtain analytic insight into the instability presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a , note that solutions in this instability branch are located near the rayleigh wave - speed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]b ( note that here @xmath158 ) .",
    "consequently , we expand eq .   to linear order around @xmath159 , obtaining an explicit expression for @xmath160  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this expansion is that the transition between stable and unstable modes occurs for @xmath35 s which approximately satisfy  @xcite @xmath161 this approximate stability criterion explains the existence of an instability and in fact gives reasonable quantitative estimates for its onset .    to see this , note that since @xmath162 ( which is negative , cf .",
    "and  @xcite ) vanishes for both @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and attains a global minimum for @xmath35 of order @xmath165 , eq .",
    "admits solutions only for certain values of the product @xmath166 .",
    "when @xmath167 is smaller than a critical value @xmath168 , no solutions exist and this branch of solutions is stable for all wavenumbers .",
    "note that this criterion has exactly the expected structure : the instability is indeed governed by @xmath36 , and large @xmath154 or @xmath156 promote instability , which only happens at a finite range of wavenumbers .",
    "these predictions are quantitatively verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]c .",
    "in addition , the real and imaginary parts of the approximate solution for @xmath160  @xcite are added to figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a - b ( dashed lines ) , demonstrating reasonable quantitative agreement with the full numerical solution for various parameters .",
    "the results presented in this section demonstrate the destabilizing role that the absence of geometrical reflection symmetry may play in frictional dynamics . in the next section ,",
    "we significantly extend the analysis to include more realistic friction laws and any geometric contrast .",
    "the analysis presented in the previous section adopted two simplifying assumptions , i.e.  that the frictional response depends only on the instantaneous slip velocity @xmath59 and that the lower block is much higher than the upper one , @xmath169 .",
    "frictional interfaces , however , are known to depend also on the state of the interface , not just on the slip velocity , and obviously the sliding bodies can feature any geometric asymmetry , i.e.  the system can attain any value of @xmath115 . consequently",
    ", our goal here is to relax these simplifying assumptions and to present a significantly generalized analysis applicable to a broad range of realistic frictional systems .",
    "it is experimentally well - established that the response of frictional interfaces depends , in addition to the slip velocity @xmath59 , on the state of the interface through the ( normalized ) real contact area @xmath170",
    "@xcite , as discussed in relation to eq .  .",
    "the auxiliary internal state variable @xmath171 , which represents the age / maturity of the contact and is of time dimensions , carries memory of the history of the interface .",
    "this implies that irrespective of the exact functional form of @xmath172 ( with @xmath173 ) the frictional response @xmath128 in eq .",
    "depends on both @xmath59 and @xmath171 , i.e.  we have @xmath174 .",
    "since @xmath156 does not depend solely on the instantaneous sliding velocity , but also on @xmath171 , one should distinguish between @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the steady state value of @xmath171 .",
    "it is also well - established that after a rapid variation in @xmath59 , accompanied by an instantaneous frictional response characterized by @xmath177 , a new steady state is established over a characteristic slip distance @xmath178 , which can be regarded as an interfacial memory length .",
    "this generic behaviour is described by the following evolution equation for @xmath171  @xcite @xmath179 with @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "while several functions @xmath182 were proposed and extensively studied in the literature  @xcite , the only property that affects the linear stability is @xmath183 .",
    "note that if @xmath184 ( corresponding to @xmath185 ) , the equation describes frictional aging ( @xmath171 increases linearly with time under quiescent conditions ) and that @xmath180 corresponds to steady state , @xmath186 , implying @xmath187 .",
    "the latter describes contact rejuvenation , where the typical contact lifetime is inversely proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "the physics incorporated in the distinction between @xmath177 and @xmath188 , and in the memory length @xmath178  within the so - called rate - and - state friction constitutive framework  imply the existence of two dimensionless parameters that are absent in the simplified analysis of sect .

    "this recovers the result of sect .",
    "[ sec : simplified ] where @xmath188 simply identifies with @xmath201 .    to understand the effect of @xmath192 and @xmath194 on frictional stability",

    "as we also want to consider arbitrary values of the height ratio @xmath115 , we should first derive expressions for the interfacial elastodynamic transfer function @xmath202 for any @xmath115 .",

    "in addition , as expected , @xmath36 vanishes for symmetric systems , i.e.  for @xmath117 .",
    "we are now ready to study the effect of the geometric dimensionless parameter @xmath115 , and of the constitutive dimensionless parameters @xmath192 and @xmath194 , on the linear stability of frictional interfaces .",
    "that is , we aim at solving the implicit linear stability spectrum in eq .  , with eqs .",
    "the ultimate goal of such a generalized linear stability analysis is to derive the stability phase - diagram in the @xmath154 ( here @xmath177 replaces @xmath201 in the definition of @xmath154 in sect .",
    "[ sec : simplified ] ) , @xmath156 , @xmath206 , @xmath115 , @xmath192 and @xmath194 parameter space , where the stability boundary is a complex hypersurface in this multi - dimensional space .",
    "as it is obviously impossible to visualize this high - dimensional stability boundary and in order to gain clear physical insight , we analyze this hypersurface by studying its sections along various parameter directions .",
    "a first step was done in sect .",

    "our next step is to isolate the geometric asymmetry effect embodied in @xmath115 .",
    "we therefore use the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a - b , together with @xmath209 , and vary @xmath115 over a very broad range , essentially from @xmath212 ( corresponding to a symmetric system ) to @xmath211 .",

    "this result provides direct evidence for the destabilizing role played by geometric asymmetry in frictional sliding .",
    "as @xmath115 is further increased , the system becomes more unstable in the sense of an increased range of unstable wave - numbers and a larger growth rate .",
    "obviously , the result in the @xmath211 limit identifies with that of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a .",
    "in fact , the @xmath211 analysis well captures the salient features of the instability spectrum for @xmath115 values moderately above the critical value @xmath214 .",
    "next , we would like to understand the effect of @xmath192 , i.e. of a difference between the instantaneous response @xmath177 and the steady state response @xmath188 , on the sliding stability in the presence of geometric asymmetry .",
    "for that aim , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum1]b @xmath213 $ ] for various values of @xmath192 , spanning the whole range @xmath193 , and fixed @xmath216 and @xmath211 .",

    "this result demonstrates the stabilizing role played by steady state velocity - strengthening friction in frictional sliding .",
    "we note , though , that the qualitative properties of the instability spectrum are rather well captured by the @xmath207 analysis ( i.e.  for velocity - dependent friction , where no distinction is made between @xmath188 and @xmath177 ) . we stress that while @xmath192 affects the properties of instability , the origin of instability is still geometric asymmetry ( i.e.  sufficiently large @xmath115 ) .",
    "finally , we explore the effect of varying the interfacial memory length @xmath178 , corresponding to varying @xmath194 , on frictional stability in the presence of geometric asymmetry .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum1]c @xmath213 $ ] for a broad range of @xmath194 values , and fixed @xmath211 and @xmath217 .",
    "it is observed that increasing @xmath178 ( i.e.  @xmath194 ) tends to stabilize sliding ( i.e.  shrink the instability range and growth rate ) as it makes the real contact area less sensitive to slip velocity perturbations .",
    "we also stress here that while @xmath194 affects the range and growth rate of instability , its origin is geometric asymmetry ( i.e.  sufficiently large @xmath115 ) .",
    "the results presented in this section provide a rather comprehensive physical picture of the implications of geometric asymmetry on the stability of frictional sliding , and of the interplay between geometric asymmetry and generic constitutive properties of frictional interfaces , most notably the effect of the state of the interface and of an interfacial memory length .",
    "the results significantly extend those presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : simplified ] , yet they show that the simplified analysis properly captured the destabilizing geometric asymmetry effect .",
    "we stress again that additional solutions to eq .",
    "( with eqs .  - ) exist .",
    "these additional solution branches , along with a more detailed analysis of the multi - dimensional stability phase - diagram , will be presented in a follow - up report .",
    "the results presented in this section regarding the stability of homogeneous sliding in the presence of geometric asymmetry may have far reaching implications for the dynamics of frictional interfaces in a variety of frictional systems . under homogeneous",
    "loading applied to the top of long enough sliding bodies , as assumed in the analysis , we predict that no homogeneous steady state will be established experimentally under certain conditions that were carefully quantified . instead , the interface separating geometrically asymmetric bodies will experience inhomogeneous slip related to the most unstable mode identified in the analysis .",
    "this will lead to spatiotemporal stick - slip - like motion , accompanied by distinct acoustic signature as in squeaking door hinges .    in frictional systems where the loading configuration promotes",
    "inhomogeneous slip , the obtained results may still be relevant .",
    "inhomogeneous slip in slowly driven frictional interfaces typically takes the form of an expanding creep patch .",
    "the conditions under which an expanding creep patch spontaneously generates rapid / unstable slip , an important process known as nucleation , may be related to the minimal unstable wavelength in the stability analysis presented in this section for geometrically asymmetric systems . in particular",
    ", the minimal unstable wavelength may determine the size at which the expanding creep patch loses stability .    finally , when rapid slip develops , it is typically mediated by the propagation of rupture modes .",
    "which mode is actually realized in a given experimental system may be affected by the stability analysis presented here . in particular , extended crack - like rupture modes leave behind them a homogeneous sliding state , which may be precluded under certain conditions predicted by our analysis . instead",
    ", localized pulse - like rupture modes may develop .",
    "consequently , the results presented in this section may affect rupture modes selection , a basic open problem in the field of friction .",
    "additional theoretical and experimental research should be carried out in order to fully explore these potential implications .",
    "in this paper , combining experiments and theory , we showed that frictional interfaces which separate bodies made of identical materials , but lack geometric reflection symmetry about the interface , generically feature coupling between interfacial slip and normal stress variations .",
    "this geometric asymmetry effect is shown to account for a sizable , and previously unexplained , normal - stress - induced weakening effect in frictional cracks .",
    "new experiments support the theoretical predictions .",
    "we then showed that geometric asymmetry can destabilize homogeneous sliding with velocity - strengthening friction which is otherwise stable .",
    "these analyses demonstrate that the effect of geometric asymmetry resembles , sometimes qualitatively and sometimes semi - quantitatively , that of material asymmetry ( the bi - material effect ) .",
    "since no system is perfectly symmetric , we expect the geometrically - induced coupling between interfacial slip and normal stress variations to generically exist in a broad range of man - made and natural frictional systems .",
    "consequently , it should be incorporated into various theoretical approaches , into engineering models and employed in interpreting experimental observations .",

    "while direct measurement of @xmath18 can be performed in our system to @xmath462 precision , we can significantly decrease this experimental uncertainty by exploiting the significant growth of the strain amplitudes as @xmath463  @xcite . using this ,",
    "we improve our measurements of @xmath18 by fitting the measured @xmath451 amplitudes to the singular solution , while assuming that @xmath438 does not significantly change in the vicinity of @xmath54 and that the system obeys plane - stress boundary conditions . using this method",
    ", @xmath18 is the only fitting parameter .",
    "results of this procedure are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figs2]a and are employed to determine @xmath18 in fig .  2 of the main text .",
    "note that the assumption of plane - stress conditions should be violated for the `` thin - on - thick '' setup . as mentioned above , the measured asymptotic velocities for",
    "the `` thin - on - thick '' setup are about @xmath413 above @xmath54 for plane - stress .",
    "nevertheless , for simplicity , we have used the plane - stress assumption in the above analysis .",

    "2a are all @xmath465 m / s ) .",
    "the use of @xmath466 , however , enables us to quantitatively differentiate between the different high @xmath18 measurements , despite possible systematic errors in determining the absolute values of @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the rupture propagation velocities stated in the legend of fig .",
    "2b in the manuscript should be understood in relative terms when normalized with respect to the relevant @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ figs2]c demonstrates that @xmath467 is correlated with the amplitude of @xmath442 , @xmath468 , directly measured at @xmath445 mm above the frictional interface .",
    "relating @xmath467 to the slip velocity , defined at @xmath23 , is of great interest .",
    "the lefm singular solution , which describes our measurements well at @xmath469 mm , predicts that the slip velocity ( and actually all strain and stress components ) should be singular at @xmath23 and @xmath470 .",
    "these singularities are naturally regularized at the crack tip . in this section",
    "we will explain the underlying assumptions that enable us to estimate the slip velocity and relate the direct measurements of @xmath451 presented in fig .",

    "these strain differences are only minor when compared to the large qualitative difference in strain measurements presented in  @xcite , where strong material contrast is considered .",
    "this observation enables us to adapt a perturbative approach in which we invoke the simplest cohesive zone model valid for the  thin - on - thin \" case to estimate the slip velocity at the interface for _ both _ geometrical setups . at this stage , however , we are not able to estimate the accuracy of this assumption for the  thin - on - thick \" setup .    in the non - singular cohesive zone model @xcite ,",
