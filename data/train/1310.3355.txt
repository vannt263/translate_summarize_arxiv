    "thanks to advances in laser science occurred over the last two decades , it is now possible to produce soft x - ray pulses in the femtosecond range , using different approaches : laser - induced high - order harmonic generation in gas ( hhg ) , free - electron lasers , and laser slicing at synchrotron beamlines @xcite . in hhg , noble - gas atoms",
    "interact with an intense laser field and emit light at the harmonics of the latter .",
    "the process can be described by means of a semiclassical `` three step model '' @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "a bound electron is extracted from a gas atom under the action of the laser field ; in the second step , the electron undergoes an oscillating motion imposed by the laser field ; in the third step , the electron collides back with the parent ion . as a result",
    ", laser harmonics are emitted up to wavelengths extending into the soft x - ray regime , and droping quickly at some cutoff energy @xcite .",
    "+ since the electron dynamics in atomic , molecular or more complex systems occurs at timescales ranging from hundreds of femtoseconds down to tens of attoseconds , hhg sources provide an ideal tool to study , and possibly control , the interactions between charge , lattice , orbital , and spin dynamics in a chemical reaction . + in 2008 , a new project has been funded in the framework of the `` cross - border cooperation program between italy and slovenia 2007 - 2013 '' @xcite .",
    "project s main objective is to set up a state - of - the - art light source at university of nova gorica ( slovenia ) .",
    "the source , named citius , has been assembled and commissioned at elettra - sincrotrone trieste ( italy ) and is going to be moved to slovenia .",
    "the mission of the new slovenian laboratory is to carry out cutting - edge experiments in a wide range of both applied and fundamental research fields , including materials science , catalysis , biochemistry and magnetism .",
    "part of the envisaged scientific program will be connected to that developed at the low - density matter beamline at the fermi@elettra free - electron laser @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we first provide a technical description of citius , and then report the results of two proof - of - principle pump - probe experiments , namely the characterization of the temporal structure of hhg pulses , and the selective investigation of the ultra - fast dynamics of different elements in a magnetic compound .",
    "the citius laser system and the beamline are schematically shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the laser system comprises a commercial amplifier `` legend elite duo '' and an optical parametric amplifier `` opera '' ( opa ) , both produced by coherent inc .",
    "the amplifier is seeded by a micra oscillator ( wavelength : 800 nm , spectral bandwidth about 100 nm , power about 380 mw ) and includes two amplification stages : a regenerative amplifier ( evo 30 ) , pumped by an evolution 30 laser ( frequency - doubled q - switched nd : ylf laser ) , and a single - pass amplifier ( evo he ) , pumped by an evolution he laser ( frequency - doubled q - switched nd : ylf laser ) .",
    "the system can be operated at four different repetition rates : 100 hz , 1 khz , 5 khz and 10 khz . at 5 khz , which is the currently adopted repetition rate",
    ", it generates pulses carrying about 3.1 mj , with a duration of about 35 fs , centered at 805 nm .",
    "two thirds of the energy is used for generating xuv pulses through hhg , one third as a pump for the opa , or directly in combination with the hhg beam for pump - probe experiments .",
    "the opa produces tunable radiation in the range between 0.4 ev and 5.6 ev , with variable energy per pulse ( from few to hundreds of microjoules ) .",
    "+ the beamline includes a high - vacuum section , through which the xuv beam propagates , and a section in air , used to transport the ir - uv light generated by the opa .",
    "the xuv part comprises a hhg generation chamber and a monochromator .",
    "the laser is focused in the generation chamber ( using the lens l1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , where it interacts with a noble gas of choice ( ar or ne , for the reported experiments ) contained in a cell , generating the high - order harmonics .",
    "the harmonic generation efficiency can be optimized by varying the laser intensity , the gas pressure ( typically , of the order of @xmath4 mbar ) and the relative position of the laser focus within the cell .",
    "+ the monochromator , whose scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , was developed by the c.n.r .- i.f.n .",
    "padova ( italy ) and will be described in detail in a different paper @xcite .",
    "it was designed to select one single harmonic , or a sub - band of it , in the spectral range between 250 and 25 nm ( 5 - 50 ev ) .",
    "however , the transmitted energy range could be further extended at the expense of efficiency , up to 100 ev .",
    "the citius monochromator is superior to similar systems @xcite , in that it adopts a single - grating design with a double configuration @xcite : an off - plane geometry ( opg ) for ultrafast response ( few tens of femtoseconds ) at the expense of energy resolution , and a classical geometry ( cg ) for high - energy resolution , albeit with long temporal response ( several hundreds of femtoseconds ) .",
    "a first toroidal mirror collimates the light coming from the generation chamber and deflects it onto a planar ( opg or cg ) diffraction grating .",
    "the diffracted light is then refocused by a second toroidal mirror onto the exit slit .",
    "the characteristics of the opg and cg gratings are reported in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".characteristics of the monochromator gratings .",
    "the energy resolution has been calculated on a 100-@xmath5m - wide exit slit . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table3 ]      in this section , we report the results of a pump - probe experiment demonstrating the possibility of using citius to study the ultra - fast dynamics of selected chemical species , with a temporal resolution of few tens of femtoseconds .",
    "+ the spectral range covered by citius includes the @xmath6 thresholds of transition metals ( 54.25 ev , i.e. , the 35th harmonic of the fundamental , see table [ table2 ] ) , making citius an appealing source for the study of magnetic materials . as a proof - of - principle application",
    ", we measured the demagnetization of a 100 mm thick permalloy film ( @xmath7 ) , using x - ray resonant magnetic scattering @xcite in pump - probe configuration .",
    "+ the experiment was performed using the irma reflectometer @xcite .",
    "the instrument permits to precisely adjust the angles between the sample surface and the incoming / reflected xuv beam .",
    "three photodiodes and one channel electron multiplier are mounted on the detector arm . by means of a horseshoe electromagnet",
    ", it is possible to apply a variable magnetic field up to @xmath8 oe , parallel to the sample surface .",
    "the scattering experiment was conducted in a transverse moke - like configuration @xcite . in this configuration ,",
    "using p - polarized xuv light , one is sensitive to the magnetization component perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "moreover , choosing the incoming / scattering angle close to the brewster condition ( about 45 deg at 54 ev ) , the magnetization contrast is maximized with respect to the ( strongly suppressed ) non - magnetic scattered background , thus improving the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement .",
    "+ we have measured the magnetic hysteresis loop at the fe @xmath6 edge , as a function of the delay between the transmitted ir beam ( pump ) and the xuv pulse ( probe ) .",
    "figure [ fig5]a shows the hysteresis loop when the xuv pulse arrives on the sample 1 ps before ( blue curve ) and 1 ps after ( red curve ) the ir pulse .",
    "the plots are normalized to the average scattered intensity .",
    "the magnetic asymmetry ratio is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the intensities of the reflected light as the externally applied magnetic field is reversed in direction . in figure",
    "[ fig5]b , the asymmetry ratio at saturation is plotted as a function of the pump - probe delay .",
    "data show the ultrafast demagnetization of the fe atoms of the sample .",
    "almost 80 % of the magnetization is dissipated 0.5 ps after the sample has been illuminated with the ir pulse .",
    "the data have been fitted with an exponential decay curve , indicating a characteristic demagnetization time of 0.21 @xmath12 0.02 ps . despite the modest scientific interest of this particular sample , which has been already investigated in detail by other groups @xcite , these results demonstrate that our apparatus is capable of measuring the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of selected chemical species , with a resolution of few tens of femtoseconds .",
    "we have presented the characteristics of citius , a new ir - xuv , femtosecond , italo - slovenian light source , based on laser - induced high - harmonic generation in gas . as a next step",
    ", we will carry out the commissioning of the experimental equipment for time resolved photoemission investigations .",
    "the apparatus consists of two vacuum chambers equipped with two different electron spectrometers : an angle - resolved time of flight ( vg - scienta artof 10k ) for pump - probe experiments and an hemispherical spectrometer ( vg - scienta r3000 ) , which will be used in combination with a monochromatized twin anode x - ray source for conventional x - ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements .",
    "a preparation chamber , equipped with evaporators and standard sample preparation tools , such as sample heating , ion sputtering and leed , will connect the two chambers .",
    "the sample will be hosted on a cryomanipulator ( able to reach a temperature below 10 k ) , operated with liquid helium , with five degrees of freedom .",
    "+ starting from 2014 , the source will be open to external users , interested in developing time - resolved applications in different domains of both fundamental and applied science",
    ". envisaged experiments will be in particular related to photophysics and photochemistry , including materials science , catalysis , magnetism and biochemistry .",
    "part of the activity will be carried out in close connection with that developed at the low - density matter beamline of the fermi free - electron laser .",
    "the citius project is funded by the program for cross - border cooperation between italy and slovenia 2007 - 2013 . c. grazioli gratefully acknowledges financial support through the talents programme ( 7th framework programme , specific programme : people - marie curie actions - cofund ) .",
    "we aknowledge the department of physics and astronomy of uppsala university for providing the vg - scienta ses200 , in the framework of the collaboration with cnr - iom ( tasc laboratory , gas phase beamline , trieste ) .",
    "we also thank carla puglia and monica de simone for technical assistance in setting up the photoemission experimental set - up , and sandra gardonio for valuable suggestions about the source desing .",
    "is particularly thankful to gvido bratina for technical and moral support during the preparation and implementation of the project citius .",
