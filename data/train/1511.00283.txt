    "a fundamental problem in convex geometry is to understand the intersection behavior of convex sets .",
    "classical theorems in this area include helly s theorem and its many variations , which show that the presence of lower order intersections of convex sets in @xmath5 can enforce intersections of higher order @xcite .",
    "recent work of tancer @xcite on the representability of simplicial complexes provides a sharp bound on the dimension in which intersection patterns of convex sets can be realized .",
    "we consider the problem of simultaneously realizing intersection patterns along with other relationships between convex sets , such as containment .",
    "this problem is motivated by one of the challenges of mathematical neuroscience : determining how the structure of a stimulus space is represented in the brain .",
    "neurons respond to stimuli in an environment ; the set of all such stimuli is called the * stimulus space * @xmath6 .",
    "usually , we consider @xmath7 .",
    "if we are considering data from @xmath8 neurons @xmath9 which respond to stimuli in @xmath6 , the * receptive field * for neuron @xmath10 is the subset @xmath11 of the stimulus space @xmath6 for which neuron @xmath10 is highly responsive . throughout this article , we assume the sets @xmath11 are convex . indeed , experimental data on many types of neurons , such as place cells @xcite or orientation - tuned neurons @xcite , make it evident that receptive fields are often very well approximated by convex sets .",
    "hence , for such neurons , the regions of stimulus space in which multiple neurons fire can be modeled by intersections of convex sets .",
    "because of this , the mathematical theory developed by helly , tancer , and others can inform us about the possible arrangements of receptive fields in a given dimension .",
    "helly s theorem , however , can not inform us about all types of receptive field arrangements . for example , if @xmath11 , @xmath12 are receptive fields which properly intersect , the neural data will differentiate between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , but helly s theorem merely notes that @xmath11 and @xmath12 intersect .",
    "we thus go beyond the usual scope of convex geometry to consider the problem of finding arrangements of convex sets which fully realize the information present in the neural data , including containments .",
    "this problem was posed originally in @xcite . in order to address this issue",
    ", we must first describe how neural data is represented mathematically .",
    "[ def : neuralcode ] a * neural code * on @xmath8 neurons is a set of binary firing patterns @xmath15 , representing neural activity .",
    "elements of @xmath16 are referred to as * codewords*.    the firing of a neuron is an all - or - nothing event , and so a codeword @xmath17 represents a data point in which a specific set of neurons are simultaneously firing ; with neuron @xmath10 active if @xmath18 and inactive if @xmath19 . for instance , the codeword @xmath20 represents a data point at which neurons 3 and 4 were active , while neurons 1 and 2 were not . in the receptive field context , the presence of this codeword in @xmath16 indicates that @xmath21 .",

    "however , as we have mentioned , the receptive fields @xmath11 are generally presumed to be convex .",
    "one of our main motivating example is that of place cells , whose receptive fields are generally seen to be convex as explained in @xcite .",
    "we additionally assume the receptive fields @xmath11 are open , since by restricting to open sets , we force all sets in our realization to be full - dimensional ; furthermore , their intersections , if nonempty , must also be full - dimensional , which corresponds to non - degenerate cases in reality . these assumptions are consistent with the literature @xcite .",
    "however , many of our proofs will require that we shift between closed and open convex sets which are associated to the same code .",
    "we therefore make the following definition : +    if @xmath26 is a collection of open ( respectively , closed ) convex sets in @xmath5 for which @xmath27 , then we say that @xmath16 is * open ( closed ) convex realizable in * @xmath5 , and that @xmath25 is an * open ( closed ) convex realization * of @xmath16 .",
