    "the model under consideration was introduced by physicists in order to understand the integer quantum hall effect and much investigated by mathematical physicists who introduced topological indices in order to explain the quantization of charge transport observed in the experiments ; consult @xcite for an access to the literature .",

    "dependent hamiltonian is @xmath6 where in the classical case @xmath7 and the hamiltonian is a function on the phase space and where in the quantum case @xmath8 and the hamiltonian is the friedrichs extension of @xmath9 defined on @xmath10 .    in the quantum case",
    "we discuss the meaning of the propagator and show that an adiabatic approximation is valid . to this end we introduce the notion of a propagator weakly associated to a time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "a detailed presentation is given in @xcite .",
    "for the classical case we show : in the past the center is bound and the particles spiral inward towards the flux line , their motion being accompanied by energy loss ; after hitting the puncture they become `` conducting '' , i.e. , the motion becomes a cycloid around an outward drifting center orthogonal to the induced electric field .",
    "the outgoing drift is without energy loss .",
    "the latter results have not been published yet but can be found in preprint @xcite .",
    "finally let us note that the dynamics of the classical system without magnetic field was discussed in @xcite .",
    "we discuss the case @xmath11 .",
    "after rescaling the physical parameters and restricting ourselves to a sector of fixed angular momentum we consider in @xmath12 the operator @xmath13 which is essentially selfadjoint on @xmath14 iff @xmath15 , and defined by the regular boundary condition at @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "we study the `` adiabatic '' limit ( @xmath18 ) of the evolution equation @xmath19 for the propagator @xmath20 .",
    "now , @xmath21 is time  dependent and so the existence of a unique solution of the evolution equation is not assured ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) ; on the other hand @xmath22 is not relatively bounded and the gaps between the eigenvalues , @xmath23 , are approximately constant in @xmath24 and thus the known theorems ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) do not assure the validity of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "our solution to these problems is the following : we use the explicit knowledge of the spectral measure of @xmath25 to show the existence of an `` adiabatic '' propagator @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath26 in turn is used to define a unique propagator @xmath27 weakly related to @xmath25 .",
    "then we show that @xmath26 is an approximation of @xmath27 ( see section  2.2 for the weak relationship ) .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath25 is discrete .",
    "denote respectively @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 the eigenvalues , eigenfunctions ( chosen real ) and eigenprojections ; let @xmath31 .",
    "define @xmath32 and its propagator @xmath26 by @xmath33    theorem for @xmath34 ,    1 .",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 is a positive increasing function on @xmath37 , 2 .",
    "@xmath38 differentiable such that @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 , 3 .",
    "@xmath41 4 .   for @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 ,",
    "it holds @xmath45    the main problem is to control the operator bound on @xmath46 of the matrix @xmath47 this is done in a number of steps . as an illustration ,",
    "the first step is to find a bound on @xmath48 for the selfadjoint integral operator with the kernel @xmath49 the bound reads @xmath50 .",
    "but more steps of similar nature are needed to complete the proof .    1 .",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 , + @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath42 is well defined by the dyson formula .",
    "3 .   @xmath54 is a propagator and the candidate to be generated by @xmath25 .",
    "further it holds @xmath55 4 .",
    "it is an open question whether @xmath42 preserves @xmath56 and thus whether + @xmath57 .      while we can not show that the propagator @xmath27 is the propagator of @xmath25 we can show that it is the unique propagator weakly associated to @xmath58 ;",
    "so if the propagator for @xmath25 exists , it equals @xmath27 .",
    "the definition of weak association relies heavily on the notion of the quasi - energy operator which is directly related to the propagator : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "we say that a propagator @xmath61 is weakly associated to @xmath25 iff @xmath62    one can actually prove that in this way introduced notion of weak association generalizes the standard relationship between a propagator and a hamiltonian as well as that at most one propagator can be weakly associated to a hamiltonian . for details see @xcite .",
    "we again discuss the linear case @xmath63 . after a rescaling one is lead to consider the hamiltonian flow of @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 . because of the cycloid  type nature of the trajectories @xmath67 around a moving center @xmath68 we use the natural splitting @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "let us denote @xmath72 an appropriate canonical coordinate system is then defined so that @xmath73 the action ",
    "angle coordinates read @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; the transformed hamiltonian is an integral of motion @xmath78 the fundamental relation between the center @xmath68 and the energy is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a constant depending on the trajectory .",
    "the asymptotic behavior described below is illustrated by fig .  1 depicting a typical trajectory .",
    "the problem can be reduced to a two - dimensional system with coordinates @xmath83 and @xmath84 . after a change of variables one arrives at a system of differential equations which is equivalent to the integral equations @xmath85 @xmath86 , where the numbers @xmath87 , @xmath88 involve initial conditions and @xmath89 the integral equations allow for iterative solution and are well suited for asymptotic analysis .",
