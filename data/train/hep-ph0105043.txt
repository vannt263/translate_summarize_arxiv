    "the study of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon is of fundamental importance in hadron physics to gain a deeper understanding of the baryon structure and the interplay between strong and electromagnetic interactions . completed and ongoing experiments at elsa , jlab , mami , mit , nikhef and other laboratories on improved measurements of the elastic proton and neutron form factors stimulated a comprehensive theoretical study of these quantities . the theoretical description of electromagnetic form factors was performed in detail within different approaches of low - energy hadron physics : qcd sum rules , chiral perturbation theory , relativistic and non - relativistic quark models , qcd - motivated approaches based on solutions of the schwinger - dyson / bethe - salpeter and faddeev equations , soliton - type models , etc . for recent experimental and theoretical advances with respect to the electromagnetic structure of nucleons",
    "see the proceedings of the last conferences @xcite-@xcite .",
    "since the early eighties chiral quark models @xcite-@xcite , describing the nucleon as a bound system of valence quarks with a surrounding pion cloud , play an important role in the description of low - energy nucleon physics .",
    "these models include the two main features of low - energy hadron structure , confinement and chiral symmetry .",
    "with respect to the treatment of the pion cloud these approaches fall essentially into two categories .",
    "the first type of chiral quark models assumes that the valence quark content dominates the nucleon , thereby treating pion contributions perturbatively @xcite .",
    "originally , this idea was formulated in the context of the cloudy bag model @xcite . by imposing chiral symmetry",
    "the mit bag model @xcite was extended to include the interaction of the confined quarks with the pion fields on the bag surface . with",
    "the pion cloud treated as a perturbation on the basic features of the mit bag , pionic effects generally improve the description of nucleon observables .",
    "later , similar perturbative chiral models @xcite were developed where the rather unphysical sharp bag boundary is replaced by a finite surface thickness of the quark core . by introducing a static quark potential of general form ,",
    "these quark models contain a set of free parameters characterizing the confinement ( coupling strength ) and/or the quark masses .",
    "the perturbative technique allows a fully quantized treatment of the pion field up to a given order in accuracy .",
    "although formulated on the quark level , where confinement is put in phenomenologically , perturbative chiral quark models are formally close to chiral perturbation theory on the hadron level .    alternatively , when the pion cloud is assumed to dominate the nucleon structure this effect has to be treated non - perturbatively .",
    "the non - perturbative approaches are based for example on refs .",
    "@xcite , where the chiral quark soliton model was derived .",
    "this model is based on the concept that the qcd instanton vacuum is responsible for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which in turn leads to an effective chiral lagrangian at low energy as `` derived '' from qcd .",
    "the classical pion field ( the soliton ) is described by a trial profile function , which is fixed by minimizing the energy of the nucleon .",
    "further quantization of slow rotations of this soliton field leads to a nucleon state , which is built up from rotational excitations of the classical nucleon . on the phenomenological level the chiral quark soliton model tends to be advantageous in the description of the nucleon spin structure , that is for large momentum transfers , but is comparable to the original perturbative chiral quark models in the description of low - energy nucleon properties .    as a further development of chiral quark models with a perturbative treatment of the pion cloud @xcite",
    ", we extended the relativistic quark model suggested in @xcite for the study of the low - energy properties of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "compared to the previous similar models of refs .",
    "@xcite our current approach contains several new features : i ) generalization of the phenomenological confining potential ; ii ) su(3 ) extension of chiral symmetry to include the kaon and eta - meson cloud contributions ; iii ) consistent formulation of perturbation theory both on the quark and baryon level by use of renormalization techniques and by allowing to account for excited quark states in the meson loop diagrams ; iv ) fulfillment of the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry ( low - energy theorems ) , including the current quark mass expansion of the matrix elements ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; v ) possible consistency with chiral perturbation theory as for example demonstrated @xcite for the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass . in the following we refer to our model as the _ perturbative chiral quark model _ ( pcqm ) .",
    "the pcqm is based on an effective chiral lagrangian describing quarks as relativistic fermions moving in a self - consistent field ( static potential ) .",
    "the latter is described by a scalar potential @xmath0 providing confinement of quarks and the time component of a vector potential @xmath1 responsible for short - range fluctuations of the gluon field configurations @xcite ( see also recent lattice calculations @xcite ) .",
    "the model potential defines unperturbed wave functions of quarks which are subsequently used in the calculation of baryon properties .",
    "baryons in the pcqm are described as bound states of valence quarks surrounded by a cloud of goldstone bosons ( @xmath2 ) as required by chiral symmetry .",
    "interaction of quarks with goldstone bosons is introduced on the basis of the nonlinear @xmath3-model @xcite . when considering mesons fields as small fluctuations we restrict ourselves to the linear form of the meson - quark interaction . with the derived interaction lagrangian",
    "we do our perturbation theory in the expansion parameter @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the pion leptonic decay constant in the chiral limit ) .",
    "we also treat the mass term of the current quarks as a small perturbation . dressing the baryon three - quark core by a cloud of goldstone mesons corresponds to the inclusion of the sea - quark contribution .",
    "all calculations are performed at one loop or at order of accuracy @xmath6 . the chiral limit with @xmath7",
    "is well defined .    in ref .",
    "@xcite our approach was successfully applied to the study of sigma - term physics .",
    "our result for the @xmath8 sigma term @xmath9 45 mev is in good agreement with the value deduced by gasser , leutwyler and sainio @xcite using dispersion - relation techniques and exploiting the chiral symmetry constraints .",
    "a complete analysis of meson - nucleon and meson - delta - isobar sigma - terms , is given including the strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "we have a physically reasonable prediction for the quantity @xmath10 @xcite characterizing the strange quark contribution to the nucleon mass .",
    "our predictions for the strangeness content of the nucleon and for @xmath11 sigma - terms are important for the ongoing da@xmath12ne experiments at frascati @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the pcqm to analyse the electromagnetic structure of nucleons .",
    "the main intention of the present work is to develop the full formalism for the effective lagrangian of the pcqm , where goldstone boson fluctuations are treated as higher order effects to the pure valence quark core results .",
    "we give detailed consideration of gauge invariance in noncovariant chiral quark model treating pion cloud perturbatively .",
    "in the present article we proceed as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we first describe the basic notions of our approach : the underlying effective lagrangian , choice of parameters and fulfilment of low - energy theorems .",
    "we extend our model lagangian by including the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "a consistent formalism of the perturbation series up to one meson loop and up to terms linear in the current quark masses is presented .",
    "we utilize a renormalization technique , which , by introducing counterterms , greatly simplifies the evaluation .",
    "thereby , local gauge invariance of the electromagnetic interaction is shown to be fulfilled both on the lagrangian level and for baryon matrix elements set up in the breit frame . in sect .",
    "3 we concentrate on the specific application of the pcqm to the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the nucleon charge and magnetic form factors expressed in terms of fundamental parameters of low - energy pion - nucleon physics ( weak pion decay constant , axial nucleon coupling , strong pion - nucleon form factor ) and of only one model parameter ( radius of the nucleonic three - quark core ) . numerical results in comparison with data",
    "are presented to test the basic and standard phenomenological implications of the model .",

    "the lo contribution to the neutron charge radius is zero and only one - loop diagrams give nontrivial contributions to this quantity : the meson - cloud ( mc ) @xmath264 @xmath58 and vertex - correction ( vc ) @xmath265 @xmath58 diagrams .",
    "the total contribution to the neutron charge radius is given by @xmath266 the magnitude of our result for the neutron charge radius , which is too small compared to the experimental value , is due to the reduced contribution of the pion cloud diagram ( fig.2c ) .",
    "the size of the meson cloud effects is in turn related to the magnitude of the renormalization constant , which for our model is z=0.9 and therefore close to unity . with an increased contribution of the pion cloud ,",
    "that is a decrease of z , one is able to reproduce the experimental result for the neutron charge radius , but one also obtains a worse description of the magnetic moments and the proton charge radius .",
    "also , perturbation theory up to one loop becomes less reliable in terms of good convergence properties .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath267 ( or @xmath268 ) and @xmath269 fm we obtain @xmath270 = -0.08 @xmath58 and @xmath271 . however ,",
    "for the other quantities we get a worse fit with : @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 fm , @xmath275 fm and @xmath276 fm . in comparison",
    ", the cloudy bag model @xcite gets a value of @xmath270 = -0.14 @xmath58 by an increased contribution of the pion cloud with @xmath277 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the predicted values for the proton magnetic moment are also less satisfactory with @xmath278 as in the original version of the cloudy bag model @xcite and @xmath279 in the improved version @xcite .",
    "the prediction for the proton charge radius is also relatively small : @xmath280 = 0.73 fm @xcite .",
    "an improved fit to the neutron charge radius , while keeping the good results for the other static observables , can possibly be achieved by including center - of - momentum corrections and also lorentz boost effects refs .",

    ", additional contributions of excited quark / antiquark states in the meson loop diagrams will further enhance the meson - cloud effects , which up to now were not studied yet consistently .",

    "in this paper , we have considered the perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) based on an effective chiral lagrangian which includes confinement phenomenologically .",
    "the lagrangian basically describes nucleons as bound states of three valence quarks surrounded by a perturbative cloud of pseudoscalar mesons as dictated by the chiral symmetry requirement .",
    "the main aim of this investigation was to present a consistent formalism when treating the lagrangian in the one - loop expansion .",
    "we thereby employed a technique , which by appropriate introduction of counterterms allows consistent mass renormalization both on the quark and the nucleon level . in a further extention of the pcqm we considered the coupling of the photon field to the nucleon . again",
    ", charge renormalization was introduced to keep a proper definition of the nucleon charge .",
    "local gauge invariance of the electromagnetic interaction is fulfilled on the lagrangian level by construction . due to the noncovariant nature of the effective confinement we introduced ,",
    "local gauge invariance is not necessarily fulfilled for physical amplitudes in any reference frame .",
    "only when working in the breit frame , nucleon matrix elements were shown to be consistent with the ward identity without further need to introduce extra terms , like contact interactions , in the lagrangian .",
    "the derived quantities ( magnetic moments , radii and form factors ) contain only one model parameter @xmath47 , which is related to the radius of the three - quark core , and are otherwise expressed in terms of fundamental parameters of low - energy hadron physics : axial coupling constant @xmath49 , weak pion decay constant @xmath5 and set of qcd parameters ( current quark masses @xmath291 and @xmath292 and quark condensate parameter @xmath293 ) .",
    "predictions are given for a variation of the free parameter @xmath47 in a physical region from 0.55 fm to 0.65 fm corresponding to @xmath294 ranging from 0.5 @xmath58 to 0.7 @xmath58 .",
    "our low @xmath281 results , that is for the nucleon magnetic moments , the charge radius of the proton and the magnetic radii of the nucleons are in reasonable agreement with data , strengthening the phenomenological validity of the pcqm . for the charge radius of the neutron we obtain the correct sign but",
    "its magnitude is smaller than the experimental value .",
    "we also presented a detailed discussion of the @xmath281-dependence of the nucleon form factors in the space - like region .",
    "although the model underestimates the finite @xmath281 behaviour of the form factors , certain additional physics aspects , such as c.m .",
    "correction and lorentz boost effects , are known to improve the phenomenological fit ( see detailed discussion in refs .",
    "the issue of c.m .",
    "corrections as evaluated in the pcqm machinery and their consistency with the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass will be addressed in a forthcoming publication . with",
    "the formal and phenomenological foundation established , the proposed model serves as a basis for further applications to recent issues of nucleon structure , for example such as photo- and electroproduction of pseudoscalar mesons , which will be pursued in future .",
