    "the drude model of electric conductivity @xcite offers a rather generic behavior for charge transport .",
    "although the concept of the drude conductivity seems to be old - fashioned it is very useful for different applications , so for chaotic transport and weak localization @xcite , magnetoresistance @xcite , dynamical ordering in a confined wigner crystal @xcite and optical conductivity @xcite .",
    "more recently the drude model came into the focus in describing the spin hall effect @xcite , for a more detailed consideration see @xcite . in spite of being a classical concept",
    "the drude model yields the universal dc and ac conductivity and its temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "in particular , the conductivity is expressed by the charge @xmath0 , the mass @xmath1 and the density @xmath2 of the charge carriers as well as a relaxation time @xmath3 via @xmath4 . in general",
    "the parameter @xmath3 reflects the microscopic origin of the transport process such as different scattering mechanisms . in the markov approach the relaxation time",
    "is given in terms of a simple damping constant @xmath5 .",
    "however , the drude conductivity should be influenced and corrected by the underlying periodic crystal potential . and",
    "even that point we would like to discuss in the present paper . here",
    "the drude conductivity is generalized by including the lattice potential .",
    "the analysis is based on the smoluchowski equation @xcite which yields likewise the probability density for the electrons in the lattice . as the result",
    "we get an exact expression for the charge conductivity @xmath6 in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "the final relation is illustrated for realistic model potentials .",
    "especially , the approach enables us to study the conductivity of nanocontacts by assuming piecewise constant potentials .",
    "however to find out the conductivity one is confronted with the problem , that the applied external electric field @xmath8 exhibits a feedback to the potential .",
    "the potential is deformed under the influence of the field which leads to a modification of the motion of the charge carriers .",
    "different to the quantum approach the carriers can overcome barriers or traps not by tunneling processes but by thermal activation .",
    "the classical equation of motion for the charge carriers under consideration of thermodynamic fluctuations are @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a damping parameter and @xmath11 is the strength of the gaussian process .",
    "both of them model the interaction with a heat bath .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath8 is a homogeneous electric field and @xmath14 is the periodic crystal potential which is originated by all other particles of the system , but one can also include other potentials such as defect potentials .",

    "it is easy to see that the equilibrium solution @xmath26 has a physical meaning only in case of a vanishing electric field .",
    "otherwise , the probability density @xmath26 is due to the presence of the electric field not normalizable . if there exist an equilibrium state for nonzero field all charged particles would accumulate at @xmath27 .",
    "it should be remarked that the same situation occurs in a quantum treatment of the problem where one can not find a wave function normalized in the whole space .",
    "however , different to the quantum case the statistical approach allows a steady state solution describing the physical situation adequately .",
    "the electric current is given by @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the total number of charge carriers and @xmath2 is the corresponding density .",
    "from here we conclude immediately that the equilibrium distribution is an improper distribution function because the current is zero due to the symmetry @xmath30 .",
    "in order to obtain the electrical conductivity one has to apply the steady state solution of eq .  .",

    "taking into account periodic boundary conditions and the normalization condition for @xmath34 one obtains @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 is the particle density .",
    "the last relation is nothing else than the drude conductivity where the relaxation time is given by the inverse damping parameter @xmath10 . for a non - zero potential",
    "the relation in eq .   will be modified accordingly . directly by integration",
    "it follows @xmath37 the average is taken using the field dependent steady state probability distribution function @xmath38 . to find out the contribution induced by the electric field we need the steady state solution for the current which obeys @xmath39 . because the steady state solution @xmath40 depends likewise on the electric field we have to incorporate the influence of the electric field on the averaged crystal potential , compare eq .  .",
