    "binary colloidal dispersions of hard spheres and rigid rods have been of growing interest recently.@xcite in the last two years kang _ _ et al.__@xcite reported on a series of experiments on self diffusion of macromolecular spheres of different sizes in host fd - virus dispersions . in the first work@xcite the authors studied tracer diffusion in a suspension of freely moving rods .",
    "they derived a theoretical expression for the long  time self diffusion coefficient , based on the smoluchowski equation for a sphere and a rod , neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the quantitative agreement with the experiment was obtained only for the large spheres , while for the small spheres the theoretical values of the diffusion constant turned out to be overestimated .",
    "this was believed to be due to the growing relevance of the hydrodynamic interactions . in another two papers long time diffusion of small spheres through an entangled rod network was investigated.@xcite in the theoretical approach the hydrodynamic interactions",
    "were taken into account with the rod network treated as a screening medium and the screening length remaining a free parameter .",
    "the present work is an attempt to provide a more fundamental description of the hydrodynamic interactions in the studied system .",
    "we focus on self diffusion of the sphere for short times in dilute rod suspensions .",
    "the diffusion coefficient can be expanded in the rod volume fraction , with the zeroth order term being the einstein diffusion constant of an isolated sphere and the first order term incorporating hydrodynamic interactions of the sphere with a single , freely moving rod .",
    "we provide a detailed description of these interactions applying the so  called bead model , in which the rod is replaced by a linear chain of touching spheres .",
    "the simplest bead model , in which the beads are treated like point friction sources , has been first developed by kirkwood and riseman@xcite in 1948 and used in calculations of diffusion coefficients of wormlike chains .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite took into account the finite size of beads and used the modified oseen tensor , obtained from replacing each bead by a shell of smaller subunits . following this methodology , de la torre _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite provided a numerical scheme for the so  called shell model , in which the beads are sufficiently small to reproduce the surface of the studied particle . however",
    ", a full hydrodynamic description , apart from forces and translational motions of the beads , must take into account higher order multipole components as well as lubrication effects arising for configurations near contact . as an example we mention the works of durlofsky _",
    "et al._,@xcite who included a number of low - level multipoles as well as lubrication corrections and ladd,@xcite who performed computer simulations incorporating multipoles in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the multipole method used here is based on the original solution in spherical coordinates proposed by schmitz and felderhof@xcite and further developed by cichocki and co  workers@xcite and provides very fast numerical convergence .",
    "it has already found many applications , for example in the problem of mobilities of spheres conglomerates@xcite and , more recently , transport coefficients in suspensions.@xcite in the numerical calculations the multipole truncation order @xmath6 is introduced and the accuracy of the results can be easily controlled by changing @xmath6 .",
    "also the lubrication corrections have been incorporated in the scheme , providing highly accurate results for the configurations near contact .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite first noted that only the relative motions shall contribute to the correction and proposed a method , which separates out the collective motions . in the foregoing work a new version of the numerical code",
    "is used , appropriate for spheres of different radii and thus enabling better imitation of the particle shapes .",
    "we study two different kinds of bead models : in the non  filled case the rod is represented by an array of identical , touching spheres on a straight line , while in the filled case , additional smaller spheres fill the gaps in the chain . apart from the numerical calculations , we provide a detailed theoretical description of the sphere ",

    "ii we start with the description of the system and we derive an expression for the diffusion coefficient in first order in the rod volume fraction @xmath0 . for low rod concentrations the correction to the einstein diffusion constant of the sphere due to the presence of rods is a linear function of @xmath0 with the slope @xmath1 proportional to the equilibrium averaged mobility diminution trace of the sphere interacting with a single freely translating and rotating rod . in section iii we show how the coefficient @xmath1 can be calculated numerically for the bead model of the rod using the multipole method . in section",
