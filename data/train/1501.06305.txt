    "modern all - sky surveys have revealed that our census of dwarf galaxies is significantly incomplete even within the local volume ( lv , see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the pandas , and the pan - starrs surveys ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , among others , have significantly increased the number of known nearby dwarf galaxies , suggesting that many more remain to be discovered @xcite . moreover , the newly discovered stellar systems show that actual dwarfs inhabit a much wider range of parameters space than previously believed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "for instance , the faintest and most metal - poor star forming galaxies were identified only in recent years , leo  t @xcite , lying at @xmath1  kpc with @xmath2 , and leo  p @xcite , having @xmath3  mpc and @xmath4 .",
    "leo  p , in particular , was discovered with a novel approach , i.e. by identifying a stellar counterpart of an ultra compact high velocity cloud ( uchvc ) identified by the alfalfa hi survey ( see also * ? ? ? * for the very recent identification of two dwarfs in the lv as counterparts to compact hi clouds ) . along this line , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a13 hereafter ) selected from the alfalfa database a sample of 59 uchvcs that they proposed as good candidates to be faint ( or even star - less ) dwarf galaxies associated with low - mass dark matter halos in the distance range 0.25  mpc@xmath52.0  mpc .",
    "triggered by the a13 analysis , we started the secco survey ( * ? ? ? * b14 hereafter ) , aimed at searching for stellar counterparts in the 25 most promising candidate mini - halos of the a13 sample .        here",
    "we present the results of the spectroscopic follow - up of one candidate stellar counterpart , d1 , identified in b14 by visual inspection of our deep images .",
    "candidate  d1 appears as an irregular ensemble of partially resolved and relatively bright clumps of compact sources surrounded by some fuzzy light ( see fig .  [ targets ] ) located just @xmath6 apart from the center of the a13 source hvc274.68 + 74.70 - 123 ( whose angular size is @xmath7 ; note that the density profile of the cloud is largely unresolved by the adopted beam ) .",
    "in b14 we concluded that the available data are consistent with a small dwarf irregular at @xmath8  mpc or with a distant group ( or cluster ) of galaxies ( b14 ) . to test these alternative hypotheses we obtained low resolution spectra of the two brightest nearly - point - like sources in the main clump of the candidate , labelled as s2 and s3 in fig .",
    "[ targets ] .",
    "we anticipate that the spectrum and the velocity of s3 qualifies it as a stellar counterpart of the considered uchvc , and the most likely hypothesis is that we have found a new very low surface brightness ( sb ) , very star - poor dwarf galaxy in the virgo cluster of galaxies .",
    "we obtained long - slit spectra with the multi - object double spectrographs 1 ( mods1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ; mt graham , az ) during the nights of june 16 , 17 , and 19 , 2014 .",
    "a total of seven @xmath9  s exposures were acquired with the mods1 red - arm equipped with the g670l grism and a slit @xmath10 wide .",
    "this set - up provides a spectral coverage in the range @xmath11    with a spectral resolution @xmath12 .",
    "the spectra were corrected for bias and flat - field , sky - subtracted , wavelength calibrated , then extracted and combined into flux - calibrated summed spectra using the pipeline developed at the _",
    "italian lbt spectroscopic reduction center_. the targeted sources are very faint ( @xmath13 ) and , consequently , the spectra have low signal - to - noise ( typically @xmath14 per pixel , depending on the wavelength ) , still they are useful for our purposes .    in fig .  [",
    "spec]a we show a portion of the final 2d spectra around the rest - frame h@xmath15 wavelength .",
    "the stellar continua of s2 and s3 are clearly visible .",
    "s3 shows an obvious emission in h@xmath15 and another h@xmath15 emission line , without any detectable stellar continuum , is identified @xmath16 above ( on the opposite side of s2 with respect to s3 , along the direction of the slit ) .",
    "we rename the main component of s3 as s3a and the additional continuum - less component s3b ( see the labels in fig .",
    "[ spec]a ) .",
    "the @xmath17 emission nearly at rest - frame clearly rules out the hypothesis that candidate  d1 is a distant group / cluster of galaxies .",
    "the lack of stellar continuum in s3b is likely the main reason why this source can not be identified in our deep images .",
    "however it is clear both from the images and from the spectra that ( a ) s3a is a complex source , partially resolved and with two additional points sources within @xmath18 from its center ( b14 ) , and ( b ) that the spectra of s3a and s3b contaminate each other , i.e. the two sources partially overlap .",
    "inspection of the extracted spectra reveals that s2 does not present any spectral feature that can be used to classify or obtain an estimate of its radial velocity . in the following",
    "we will discuss in more detail the spectra of the sources s3a and s3b .    .",
    "the spectra are labelled after the associated sources .",
    "note the lack of stellar continuum for s3b .",
    "negative spectra footprints ( dark features ) are artefacts of the process of sky subtraction on stacked spectra .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) : remarkable portions of 1-d spectra of s3a ( b ) and s3b ( c ) .",
    "the spectra have been smoothed with a boxcar filter of size 5  px .",
    "the emission lines that have been identified are labelled .",
    "thin vertical lines marks the rest - frame wavelength of the lines , for reference . ]    in fig .",
    "[ spec]b , c we show a portion of the 1d spectra of s3a and s3b , with the identified spectral lines in emission highlighted and labelled ; from left to right [ oiii]@xmath19 , h@xmath15 , [ nii]@xmath20 , [ sii]@xmath21 , and [ sii]@xmath22 . the line ratios of both s3a and s3b ( see table  [ targ ] ) are consistent with those of extragalactic hii regions @xcite , and not compatible with shocked gas ( e.g. , supernova remnants ) . while the [ sii / h@xmath15 ] and [ sii](6717/6731 ) ratios of s3b lie ( formally ) in the range typical of planetary nebulae ( pn ) , they are still compatible with hii regions if the errors are taken into account . on the other hand s3a falls on the hii regions loci in all the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the close spatial and kinematic association strongly suggest that s3a and s3b are probably bright knots within an extended hii   complex with different levels of excitation and displaying variations in the line ratios , like , e.g. , the giant hii region ngc  595 in m  33 @xcite .",
    "given the low s / n and spectral resolution of our spectra , as well as the paucity of spectral features , we estimate the radial velocity in different ways , using original or smoothed ( with a 5  px wide boxcar filter ) spectra , including and excluding one or more lines from the analysis , and in all cases we obtain consistent results . our final best - estimate of the heliocentric radial velocity ( @xmath24 in the following ) of s3a is obtained by cross - correlation of the smoothed spectrum with a synthetic flat spectrum with four gaussians of the proper width added at the rest - frame wavelength of the four lines identified in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ spec]b . in this way",
    "we get @xmath25  .",
    "the attached error bar takes into account both statistic and systematic uncertainties affecting our estimate , including significant uncertainties in the velocity zero point ( vzp ) .",
    "unfortunately , the low s / n of our spectra prevented the possibility to correct the vzp using telluric features .",
    "since we placed the intensity peak of s3a ( as identified in b14 ) at the center of the slit , the error on the vzp due to imperfect alignment should be limited to @xmath26  px , corresponding to @xmath27  , by far the dominant source of uncertainty . on the other hand",
    "we had no previous knowledge of the position of s3b and its luminosity peak can be misaligned with respect to the slit center by as much as @xmath28  px , corresponding to systematics in @xmath24 up to @xmath29  ; we adopt half of this value as a rough estimate of the @xmath30 error on the velocity of s3b . using only @xmath17 ,",
    "de - blended from the contamination by s3a , we find @xmath31   from the smoothed spectra of s3b .    given their proximity in the sky ( @xmath16 ) and in velocity , it seems exceedingly unlikely that s3a and s3b are not physically associated .",
    "hence the velocity of s3b is probably affected by a significant mis - centering bias and , consequently , we adopt the velocity of s3a as the systemic velocity of the two sources . this velocity is compatible with the velocity of the associated uchvc ( @xmath32 , from a13 ) , _ implying that at the center of hvc274.68 + 74.70 - 123 there is indeed a stellar counterpart , with ongoing star formation_. this conclusion is also supported by the fact that the stellar clump including s2 and s3 , as well as another stellar blob associated with candidate d1 a few arcsec to the south of s3 , are also detected in nuv images from the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) mission , and measured as a single source with @xmath33 .",
    "unfortunately , no fuv images of d1 are available .    with the information available in the spectra , we can attempt to estimate some physical and chemical properties of the two regions . from the ratio [ sii]6717/[sii]6730 we obtain an electron density @xmath34  @xmath35 for s3a ( assuming an electron temperature 10000  k ) . from the line ratio n2=log([nii]@xmath20/h@xmath15)=@xmath36 , computed from the cumulative spectrum ( s3a+s3b )",
    ", we obtain a rough estimate of the average metallicity of the whole hii   complex . using the calibration for hii   regions by @xcite we find an oxygen abundance 12+log(o / h)=@xmath37 , larger than the typical values found in hii   regions of local dwarfs @xcite .",
    "if s3a is a genuine hii region , the possibility that it belongs to our own galaxy seems highly unlikely . assuming that the most compact hii  regions with the electron density of s3a ( see below ) have diameters @xmath38  pc @xcite , and adopting , very conservatively , the observed fwhm ( @xmath39 on the r images , where the stellar point spread function has fwhm@xmath40 ) as the angular size of the region",
    ", it turns out that s3a must lie at least at @xmath41  kpc from us ( @xmath42  kpc if we consider the separation between s3a and s3b as the typical size of the complex ) . moreover , galactic star forming regions should lie in the galactic disc , while the direction to hvc274.68 + 74.70 - 123 is nearly perpendicular to it and its velocity is completely incompatible with the disc . the hypothesis of a hvc located in the outer galactic halo ( @xmath42  kpc ) and including a star forming region appears similarly unlikely , since the cases of galactic hvcs with an associated stellar component are exceedingly rare , if any @xcite .",
    "there is another possibility that may be considered .",
    "hvcs are known to host ionized gas , in addition to hi ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it can be conceived that a relatively nearby hvc , partially ionised by radiation from massive stars in the galactic disc , can be closely aligned along the line of sight , by chance , with background unrelated sources identified as candidate d1 . in this case",
    "the emission lines we see in the spectra of s3a and b would not be associated with these sources but with the cloud , and would be superimposed on the featureless stellar continuum of the background sources .",
    "the main argument against this scenario is that emission lines are not seen superimposed on the continuum of s2 , lying just @xmath43 apart from s3a , while h@xmath15 emission in hvcs is observed over scales comparable with the dimension of the clouds ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that no other rest - frame h@xmath15 emission is detected along the @xmath44 long mods slit , in our spectra , suggesting that the observed emission lines are indeed associated with the s3 stellar source . moreover , hvcs display typical h@xmath15 fluxes of @xmath45  rayleigh and generally lower than @xmath46  rayleigh @xcite , while , assuming an area of 1  arcsec@xmath47 for s3a and b , their h@xmath15 fluxes are @xmath48  rayleigh and @xmath49  rayleigh , i.e. a factor from @xmath50 to @xmath51 larger than this .",
    "the case for a galactic hvc ( associated to or simply aligned with s3a and b ) , as unlikely as it may appear , would provide a natural explanation ( a ) for the radial velocity of the system , that is clearly incompatible with the hubble flow , and ( b ) for the derived n2 value , that is fully compatible with those observed in hvcs @xcite , while , in the hypothesis of a dwarf galaxy ( explored in the next section ) it would imply an exceedingly high metallicity for the estimated optical luminosity .",
    "let us now consider the hypothesis that we have discovered a new faint dwarf galaxy , where a few clumps of star forming regions are enclosed within a ( comparatively ) huge hi   cloud .",
    "we preliminarily name it secco  1 , after the name of the survey . since there is no detectable smooth distribution of light around the clumps , to get an estimate of the integrated magnitude and of the half - light radius we recur to simple aperture photometry , taking the ellipse plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ targets ] as the tentative outer limit of the stellar system .",
    "the results are reported in tab .",
    "[ secco1 ] .",
    "the integrated color , @xmath52 , is typical of a star - forming galaxy ( see table  [ targ ] ) .",
    "unfortunately we have only broad constraints on the distance .",
    "the fact that we do not resolve rgb stars implies that @xmath53  mpc ( see b14 ) , if an old population is there . in any case , the system is not participating into the hubble flow , since for @xmath53  mpc this implies @xmath54  ( * ? ? ? * mc12 hereafter ) .    adopting distances in the range 3.0  mpc@xmath516.5  mpc ( the latter value corresponding to the distance of the virgo cluster , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can derive several physical characteristics of the stellar and gaseous body of secco  1 . in this distance interval ,",
    "the system nicely fits into the observed @xmath55 and @xmath56 relations for local dwarf galaxies shown by mc12 ( see fig .  [ compa]a , b ) .",
    "the relevant quantities span the ranges @xmath57 , 160  pc@xmath58880  pc , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "mpc the star formation rate , estimated from the h@xmath15 luminosity according to @xcite , is @xmath62  m@xmath63  yr@xmath64 , among the lowest rates recorded in local star - forming dwarfs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "secco  1 is a very low luminosity , low sb analog of the low - mass isolated star forming galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "these lie in the distance range 3.2  mpc@xmath518.7  mpc and are associated with alfalfa small clouds listed by @xcite which have stellar counterparts that are visible in sdss images .",
    "hvc274.68 + 74.70 - 123 corresponds to agc226067 in the @xcite catalog , where it is commented with the note `` no identifiable optical counterpart '' .",
    "indeed secco  1 is barely visible even in our images , more than 4  mag deeper than sdss .",
    "hence it would represent an extremely dark member of this population .",
    "still , all of the @xcite galaxies are more or less compatible with being participants in the local hubble flow , while secco  1 is not .",
    "secco  1 is a very low luminosity , low sb member of the virgo cluster .",
    "indeed , it lies at just @xmath66 from the center of the cluster and has a velocity well within the range spanned by cluster members ( that reaches @xmath67  , * ? ? ?",
    "this hypothesis also implies the lowest ( and most reasonable ) total mass to light ratio for the system , @xmath68 , and the highest baryon fraction , @xmath69 .",
    "hypothesis 2 appears as the more natural explanation of the available observational material .",
    "still , according to the stellar mass - metallicity relation for galaxies by @xcite , the metallicity we obtain from n2 implies a stellar mass of about @xmath70 for secco  1 , which appears incompatible with the estimates from the integrated magnitude , independently of the assumed distance ( @xmath71 , adopting @xmath72 ) .",
    "however the @xmath30 lower limit of our [ fe / h ] estimate is marginally compatible with the @xmath73  -  [ fe / h ] relation for lv dwarfs by mc12 , if it is assumed that secco  1 lies in virgo ( see fig .",
    "[ compa]c ) .    the final word on the nature of secco  1 can be obtained only with hubble space telescope observations , that would allow one to resolve rgb stars ( if any ) even at the distance of virgo in such a low sb system @xcite .",
    "high spatial resolution hi observations and h@xmath15 imaging may also provide very useful insight .",
    "if secco  1 is indeed a dwarf galaxy , it would be an extremely gas - dominated and star - poor one , akin to the isolated `` almost dark '' dwarf galaxies discussed by @xcite .",
    "independent of the assumed distance , its @xmath65 ( and @xmath74 ) ratio , in solar units , is @xmath75 , much larger than in the dwarfs listed by mc12 ( fig .",
