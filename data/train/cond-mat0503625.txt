    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms s ) have been studied extensively because of the potential possibility to use both charge and spin degrees of freedom of carriers in the electronic devices , namely in the spintronics  @xcite .",
    "however , the most investigated ii - vi and iii - v compounds doped with magnetic transition metal ions have curie temperature ( t@xmath4 ) about 110  k or less .",
    "recent research effort has been focused on developing new ferromagnetic semiconductors operating at room temperature . in this connection oxide semiconductors became a subject of intent interest  @xcite . in 2001",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that co - doped anatase tio@xmath0 can keep ferromagnetic order up to 400  k with magnetic moment about 0.32  @xmath2/co for co concentration up to 8  % .",
    "more recently , park _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite have successfully grown the ferromagnetic co - doped rutile tio@xmath0 films .",
    "the curie temperature was estimated to be above 400  k for 12  % of co content . by now a lot of other semiconductors showing room - temperature ferromagnetism have been fabricated  @xcite .    despite recent experimental success , there is no consistent theoretical description of dms s . at first , ferromagnetism in co -",
    "doped tio@xmath0 was explained in terms of carrier induced mechanism like in iii - v based dms s  @xcite .",
    "samples fabricated under oxygen - rich conditions show negligible magnetization and are insulators @xcite so that one can suppose that oxygen vacancies , which are easily formed in thin films , are essential to ferromagnetic order and conductivity .",
    "the magnetic moment value also depends on the sample growth conditions .",
    "for example , it is reported to be 1.26  @xmath2/co in  @xcite to compare with 0.32  @xmath2/co , obtained by matsumoto _",
    "et al . _",
    "the most recent measurements  @xcite yield a spontaneous magnetization value of 1.1  @xmath2/co atom for the films which were highly insulating with co in 2 + state .",
    "the problem of the role of magnetic ions doping and oxygen deficiency in the origin of room - temperature ferromagnetism was considered in many theoretical papers .",
    "for example , in  @xcite first - principles calculations were performed to consider the influence of vacancy position on magnetic properties of co - doped tio@xmath0 , in particular , on co spin state .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite treated an oxygen vacancy in the supercell ( ti@xmath5co@xmath6o@xmath7 ) by the lsda+u method with spin - orbit coupling taken in spin - diagonal form .",
    "they showed that for the anatase structure of ti@xmath8co@xmath9o@xmath0 ( x = 0.0625 and 0.125 ) the presence of oxygen vacancy near co results in the state with the spin magnetic moment of 2.53  @xmath2 , whereas the presence of vacancy near ti does not affect the magnetic moment value distinctly .",
    "however , according to their results , oxygen vacancy near ti site is more stable .",
    "this conflicts with  @xcite where the opposite is claimed : the oxygen vacancy prefers to stay near co , and it causes the magnetic moment on co equal to 0.90  @xmath2 . in  @xcite overlap polaron model caused by shallow donor electrons",
    "was proposed to explain high curie temperatures in co - doped tio@xmath0 . unlike super - exchange or double - exchange interaction , ferromagnetic exchange",
    "is suggested to produce long - range order .",
    "the other recent theoretical works are devoted to the role of interstitial co that might appear in the material  @xcite . from one point of view",
    ", interstitial co destroys the spin polarization of the substitutional co nearby and , hence , reduces the average impurity magnetic moment  @xcite . from the other results , there is an enhancement of the average value of the local magnetic moment relative to the co@xmath3 low spin state with the presence of substitutional co  @xcite .",
    "some theoretical investigations claimed that co impurities have strong tendency for clusterization  @xcite .",
    "process of preparation and concentrations of co impurity can lead to co metal clusters and/or dispersed matrix - incorporated co  @xcite .    at the same time , the authors of  @xcite confirm the absence of co metal clusters .",
    "thus , there are many aspects of physical properties of co - doped tio@xmath0 which are under debate up to date .",
    "the main purpose of this work was to clarify the role of co impurities and oxygen deficiency in the origin of ferromagnetism with high t@xmath4 in co - doped tio@xmath0 .",
    "since tetravalent ti@xmath10 ion is substituted by divalent co@xmath3 , there are intrinsic oxygen vacancies in doped system to compensate this charge difference .",
    "the actual value of oxygen deficiency is difficult to estimate because defect concentration strongly depends on the growth conditions .",
    "we have considered several model systems with various content of co impurity ions and vacancies . in our study",
    "we assumed that there is no co clustering , co ions are substitutional and their valency state is + 2 .",
    "our investigations were performed using the linearized muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) band structure calculation method within the local spin density approximation with the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath11 ( lsda+u )  @xcite .",
    "the lattice relaxation was neglected .",

    "the analysis was started with calculation of the electronic structure of tio@xmath0 in stoichiometric case without doping and defects .",
    "tio@xmath0 has three kinds of crystal structures : rutile , anatase and brookite . for our calculations",
    "we choose the first one with crystallographic parameters , taken from  @xcite .",

    "; two types of empty spheres ( atomic spheres with zero nuclear charge ) were added .",
    "the valence band is formed by mainly oxygen 2@xmath15 orbitals contribution , and the conduction band by ti 3@xmath16 orbitals .",
    "the lda calculation gave the value of band gap equal to 1.7  ev which is significantly less than the experimental value of 3.1  ev  @xcite .",
    "mo et al .",
    "@xcite shown that while lda underestimates the energy gap , other ground state properties such as equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "it is well - known problem of band gap underestimation in lda approach , where potential is orbital - independent .",
    "it can be improved by means of lsda+u method , where orbital - dependent potential acts in different way on the occupied and unoccupied @xmath16-orbitals  @xcite . in the top panel of figure  [ pure ] the electronic structure obtained from the lsda+u calculation",
    "the values of on - site coulomb interaction parameters @xmath11 and @xmath17 for ti 3@xmath16 orbitals were chosen to be 6.0  ev and 0.7  ev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the calculated band gap value is 3.3  ev in good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "the lmto radii and u and @xmath17 values were taken to provide experimental gap value , they weakly influence the magnetic properties .",

    "the oxygen vacancies play dual role in this material . in the first",
    ", every vacancy adds two electrons to the system and in the second , it produces localized states in the energy gap . in order to separate the influence of those factors on the electronic structure and magnetic state of the system we imitated the first one in the calculation by adding electrons to the supercell with compensating their negative charge by the uniform charge of the opposite sign distributed over the supercell",
    "this has a meaning of taking into account the presence of the vacancy in the crystal but somewhere far away from the atoms considered in the model calculations so that one can neglect the influence of the localized states produced by this vacancy .",
    "the substitution of tetravalent ti@xmath10 ion by divalent co@xmath3 has an effect of adding two holes to the system .",
    "this could be also imitated in our calculations by removing two electrons from the supercell with the adding the corresponding uniform charge of the opposite sign .",
    "this adding ( removing ) of the electrons is not simply shift of fermi energy level as in the `` rigid band '' approximation because we performed fully self - consistent calculations with the changed number of electrons and took into account the change of the charge density distribution and hence electron potential .    in the present study we adjusted total number of electrons in the system so that co ions were always in divalent state ( experimental works report @xcite that all co ions are in + 2 formal oxidation state )",
    ". in each model calculation with co impurity the supercell of tio@xmath0",
    "was considered to make impurity concentration close to the experimental values of 8 - 12  % . for vacancy states",
    "we have considered all three possible configurations : unoccupied , occupied with one electron and fully occupied with two electrons .",
    "to investigate the electronic structure of co - doped tio@xmath0 , we used a supercell containing sixteen tio@xmath0 formula units with two ti replaced by co where impurities are separated by 6.59   .",
    "such supercell corresponds to 12.5  % of co content .",
    "ti@xmath18o@xmath19 model compound . ]    in order to reproduce co ions in + 2 formal oxidation state co@xmath3 ( according to experimental evidence @xcite ) we have added to the system two electrons per co ion ( four electrons per supercell ) . physically that is equivalent to considering the system with one oxygen vacancy per co ion ( co@xmath20ti@xmath18o@xmath21 instead of co@xmath20ti@xmath18o@xmath19 model compound ) but without explicitly taking into account the localized states produced by the vacancy in the energy gap .",
    "the resulting density of states has an insulating character . in figure  [ 2co201 ]",
    "we present the electronic structure for co@xmath20ti@xmath18o@xmath19 model compound obtained from the lsda+u band calculations .",
    "the values of on - site coulomb interaction parameters @xmath11 and @xmath17 for co 3@xmath16 orbitals were chosen as 8  ev and 1  ev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "because of large distances between impurities due to small co concentration , one can expect that exchange interaction between co ions is weak . to estimate the exchange interaction parameter",
    ", we examined the total energy difference between ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) orientations of co ions magnetic moments .",
    "our results showed that fm phase is lower in energy than afm by 3  mev ( or @xmath2230 k ; that is an order of magnitude smaller then experimental value of t@xmath4 ) .",
    "the obtained magnetic moments values for co ions in the ground state are 3  @xmath2 .",
    "thus , exchange interaction of magnetic ions is fm , but weak even for the impurity concentration larger than ones in fabricated samples of co - doped tio@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "therefore exchange interaction between impurities magnetic moments alone without taking into account other states can not yield as high t@xmath4 as observed .",
    "in order to explore the electronic structure and magnetic properties changes caused by the localized states produced by oxygen vacancies , we at first considered a supercell containing four formula units of tio@xmath0 with one oxygen atom replaced by an empty sphere ; it corresponds to tio@xmath21 composition .",
    "result of the lsda+u calculation is shown in figure  [ pure ] ( bottom panel ) . electronic structure for oxygen vacancy exhibits narrow defect band , which is fully occupied .",
    "it is formed of mainly ti @xmath16-states of the ti ions nearby the vacancy split off from the bottom of conduction band and has a symmetry of @xmath23 orbital centered on the vacancy site .",
    "two electrons added to the system as the result of removing o@xmath24 ion occupy this band of @xmath23 symmetry and result in a nonmagnetic ground state . to obtain a magnetic solution and , consequently , localized moment",
    ", this band should be partially filled .",
    "that corresponds to a so - called @xmath25-center with one electron localized on an oxygen vacancy state .    to study half - filled vacancy band ( still without explicitly considering cobalt impurity ) , we added one hole per supercell . physically such occupancy of the defect states could be realized if the system contains one co@xmath3 impurity per two oxygen vacancies or one ti vacancy per four oxygen vacancies . in all our further calculations we added the number of holes which would provide half - filled band formed of oxygen vacancies .    the partial occupancy of the defect band results in a spin - polarized magnetic solution .",
    "the magnetic state has lower total energy in comparison with nonmagnetic one ; thus , it is the ground state of the system with the magnetic moment value per supercell of 1  @xmath2 . in figure  [ defect_band ]",
    "the density of states for this magnetic solution is presented .",
    "model compound in magnetic state .",
    "fermi energy is zero . ]",
    "considering our result one can suppose that not only co ions , but also vacancies yield sizeable magnetic signal in co - doped tio@xmath0 .",
    "the similar idea was proposed in recent paper  @xcite , where observed room - temperature ferromagnetism in zno was interpreted in terms of a spin - split donor impurity - band model , and @xmath25 centers , associated with oxygen vacancies , were considered as a possible source of magnetism . in principle , vacancies themselves without magnetic impurities could induce magnetization as was shown in the work of monnier _ et al . _",
    "they observed high temperature ferromagnetism in normally pure cab@xmath26 , fabricated under ca - poor growth conditions . in these crystals",
    "strong covalency of the b - b bonds makes b - vacancies more energetically preferable to form .",
    "large values of magnetic moments could be obtained in the distorted lattices where vacancies are located nearby .",
    "we have also investigated exchange interaction between vacancies , considered fm and afm configurations of vacancies moments .",
    "we dealt with a supercell containing eight formula units with two oxygen vacancies in a supercell ; it corresponds again to tio@xmath21 composition .",
    "the results of the lsda+u calculations showed that afm solution is lower in energy by 50  mev .",
    "that can be explained by the hubbard model theory .",
    "it predicts that afm solution is the ground state in the case of half - filled band .",
    "the next step is to study how vacancy moment interacts with co one and how the presence of vacancy influences on co - co interaction .",
    "in order to explore the influence of vacancy states on the magnetism of co - doped tio@xmath19 , we considered a supercell containing eight formula units with one co impurity and one oxygen vacancy at three different possible distances from each other .",
    "the energy difference between fm and afm configurations of co and vacancy was calculated for each case within lsda+u approach to estimate the strength of exchange interaction between co and vacancy magnetic moments . as in the previous section",
    ", total number of electrons in the supercell was adjusted to produce divalent co@xmath3 ions and half - filled oxygen vacancy states ( @xmath25-centers ) . that required adding one electron to the supercell because every vacancy adds two electrons to the system and",
    "two electrons are removed when tetravalent ti@xmath10 ion is substituted by divalent co@xmath3",
    ". that could be realized by the presence of additional oxygen vacancy per co - vacancy pair but without considering explicitly the corresponding localized states .",
    "ti@xmath18o@xmath21 model compound .",
    "distance is given in the units of lattice constant a=5.92   . ]",
    "the obtained results are presented in figure  [ dotes ] . in all three cases , afm arrangement of co and vacancy spins",
    "is lower in energy .",
    "the calculated moments of co and vacancy are 3  @xmath2 and -1  @xmath2 , correspondingly .",
    "thus , oxygen vacancy prefers to have the magnetic moment that is afm ordered to co moment .",
    "one can see ( figure  [ dotes ] ) that strength of interaction between co and vacancy drops rapidly with the increase of the distance between them . for the nearest and the longest distances of 1.9    and 4.1   , the energy difference values are 330  mev and 40  mev , correspondingly .",
    "this energy interval corresponds to the temperature range from @xmath223800  k to 500  k. we suppose that the presence of strong exchange interaction between co and vacancy moments might results in a strongly coupled system of co and vacancies magnetic moments with a high ordering temperature .    ti@xmath18o@xmath27 model compound obtained from the lsda+u calculations .",
    "zero of energy is at the fermi energy . ]    to investigate vacancy influence on the strength of exchange interaction between co spins , we used the same supercell as in section  [ co - doped tio2 ] , but with one oxygen ion removed from it .",
    "we chose the position of the oxygen vacancy which is at the equal distance of 3.58    from both co ions .",
    "again total number of electrons in the supercell was adjusted to produce divalent co@xmath3 ions and half - filled oxygen vacancy states ( @xmath25-centers ) . in this case that required adding three electron to the supercell .",
    "( similarly to the previous case that could be realized by the presence of three additional oxygen vacancies per supercell but without considering explicitly the corresponding localized states . )",
    "total and partial densities of states for afm and fm configurations of co ions obtained from the lsda+u calculations are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "one can see that vacancy induced states are situated around the fermi level between occupied and unoccupied co 3@xmath16 states without overlapping them .",
    "this electronic structure rather agrees with the scheme proposed for mn impurity in a spin - split donor impurity - band model ,  @xcite where there is no overlap of vacancy band with 3@xmath16 states .",
    "but in contrast with that , vacancy states are not in the middle between co majority and minority states , but shifted closer to the occupied 3@xmath16 states , although without overlapping , like in the scheme proposed for ti in  @xcite .    from the calculations we found that strength of magnetic ions interaction in the presence of vacancy is three times stronger than that without vacancy .",
    "the corresponding energy difference between afm and fm configurations of co ions is equal to 10  mev ; fm orientation of co magnetic moments is lower in energy .",
    "the obtained total cell magnetization is 5  @xmath2 . at",
    "that each co accounts for 3  @xmath2 .",
    "vacancy moment is equal to 1  @xmath2 and is afm ordered with respect to co moments .",
    "the solution with fm order of moments is not stable .",
    "again , oxygen vacancy moment prefers to be afm ordered to co one like in the previous case of one co and vacancy in the cell , which effectively results in a fm coupling between co ion moments .",

    ", 2 co , 1 vac)&co - co   ( empty / full - filled)&3 +    the next step in the investigation of vacancy influence on co spins interaction is to examine it when defect state band is empty or full , and , hence , vacancy is nonmagnetic . as vacancy states are situated between co majority and minority @xmath16-states ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) , addition of an electron or a hole makes the band full or empty , correspondingly , but does not change co valence .",
    "energy difference between fm and afm configurations of co ions appears to be about 3  mev in the case of both empty and full defect state band , like in the supercell without vacancy .",
    "thus , the presence of oxygen vacancy enhances co ions interaction only when the vacancy is magnetic .",
    "in summary , using lsda+u approach we have investigated the role of magnetic impurities and oxygen vacancies in the formation of ferromagnetism with high t@xmath4 in co - doped tio@xmath0 .",
    "we found that exchange interaction of magnetic co ions is ferromagnetic , but very weak due to the large average impurity - impurity distance .",
    "however , its strength becomes three times stronger when there is a magnetic vacancy present .",
    "the obtained magnetic moments are 3  @xmath2 and 1  @xmath2 for co and vacancy , respectively .",
    "we also found that interaction between co and vacancy moments is surprisingly very strong even for the longest distance of 4.1    in the supercell . in this case energy difference between fm and afm configurations of co and vacancy moments",
    "is 40  mev , that corresponds to @xmath22500  k. our results lead us to think that the observed magnetic signal can not be attributed to co ions only : vacancies moments should be taken into consideration too .",
    "it seems that strong interaction between co and vacancy moments is a key moment for explanation of high t@xmath4 in co - doped tio@xmath0 .",
