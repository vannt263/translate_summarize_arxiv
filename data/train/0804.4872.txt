    "spin - exchange collisions @xcite , brought about by the pauli exchange interaction , play a dominant role in the physics of spin - polarized atomic vapors and their applications @xcite .",
    "spin - exchange collisions are responsible not only for the very useful transfer of spin - polarization from one atomic species to another @xcite , but also for the detrimental effect they have on spin coherence , i.e. spin - exchange collisions cause decoherence @xcite .",
    "the spin - coherence lifetime poses fundamental limitations to precision measurements involving spin - polarized atoms @xcite , as for example measurements of a small magnetic field ( or a small larmor frequency ) performed with atomic magnetometers @xcite .",
    "however , it was early on realized @xcite that decoherence due to spin - exchange collisions can be suppressed if the spin - exchange rate is large enough relative to the frequency scale set by the atomic larmor precession in an external magnetic field . in this work",
    "we will re - interpret this result in terms of quantum measurement theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will reformulate this in terms of the quantum zeno effect @xcite , the essence of which is that a frequent enough interrogation of a quantum system fundamentally alters its time evolution .",
    "we will also consider the physical information on the atomic spin state provided by these collision - induced measurements . from this perspective",
    ", we will also describe another kind of spin - dependent atomic collisions , namely spin - destruction collisions .",
    "the latter also lead to decoherence , which however is monotonically increasing with the collision rate , contrary to spin - exchange collisions .",
    "whereas both kinds of collisions can be understood as performing a quantum measurement of the atomic spin coherence , they fundamentally differ on the route taken by the information provided by these measurements . in spin - exchange collisions ,",
    "some information is in principle available , whereas in spin - destruction collisions the information is irretrievably lost in the environment .",
    "the reason for elaborating on this alternative perspective on spin - exchange collisions is that it motivated a recently discovered analogy to a seemingly different physical system , namely the charge - recombination of radical - ion - pairs @xcite .",
    "in describing quantum measurements , we usually distinguish between the quantum system under consideration and the quantum probe which is an auxiliary quantum system .",
    "the probe interacts with the quantum system , all information on which is later extracted by performing measurements on the quantum probe @xcite .",
    "the dissipative interaction of an open quantum system with its environment can also be molded into the previous picture , only now the probe system describing the environmental degrees of freedom is unobserved , i.e. information about the quantum system irretrievable leaks into the environment . while decoherence is present in both cases , in the former it is due to the unavoidable back - action of the probe onto the system , whereas in the latter due to information leakage to the environment .    in the specific case of @xmath0 alkali - metal atoms confined in a cell ,",
    "each atom is the quantum system , whereas all other atoms form a multitude of quantum probes .",
    "this distinction obviously fades away as we describe the combined system of @xmath0 atoms , the behavior of which is an average over @xmath0 separate quantum systems .",
    "the system degrees of freedom are embodied in the atomic spin state , described as usual @xcite by the atom s @xmath1-dimensional",
    "ground state hilbert space , where @xmath2 is the atom s nuclear spin .",
    "the environmental degrees of freedom are found in the practically classical translational angular momentum of the atoms .",
    "the binary spin - exchange interaction hamiltonian of two colliding atoms with electron spin @xmath3 and @xmath4 is of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a function of the internuclear distance @xcite .",
    "for one such collision we denote by @xmath7 the integral of @xmath6 over the collision trajectory , hence the hamiltonian describing one completed collision is @xmath8 ( in units @xmath9 ) .",
    "obviously @xmath7 depends on the particular collision trajectory .",
    "if @xmath10 is the duration of the collision , then @xmath11 is the phase angle swept by each atomic spin during this collision . due to the electrostatic nature of spin - exchange collisions @xcite , @xmath12 . by measuring @xmath13 of atom 2 ( the quantum probe ) , we can in principle",
    "extract information about the spin state of atom 1 ( the quantum system ) .",
    "indeed , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath14 is interpreted by atom 2 as an effective magnetic field @xmath15 , hence @xmath13 is the precession angle of atom 2 spin in this magnetic field .",
    "although extracting the value of @xmath16 requires knowledge of the specific collision trajectory ( hidden in the precise value of @xmath7 ) , the direction of @xmath16 can be readily found from the sign of the phase rotation @xmath13 .",
    "another quantum probe ( another atom ) can extract similar directional information at a later time .",
    "a large number of such collisions is thus found to sample the atomic spin precession , hence from a series of such observations the spin - precession ( larmor ) frequency @xmath17 can be inferred .",
    "needless to mention that this is not the way that @xmath17 is measured in actual experiments .",
    "however , information being physical @xcite , the particular way of extracting it is inconsequential .",
    "the uncertainty in such a measurement of @xmath17 will be determined by the fact that the measurement can not go on forever .",
    "spin - exchange collisions will eventually produce a back - action on the measured quantum system . for small times and large spin - polarizations , this back - action is minimal @xcite .",
    "however , as the spin - polarization decays , spin - exchange collisions will be able to induce a large phase jump @xmath13 on the coherent spin precession of atom 1 ( or , equivalently , any other atom ) .",
    "the number of such phase jumps per unit time will be given by the spin - exchange rate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the atom number density , @xmath20 the mean relative velocity of two colliding atoms and @xmath21 the spin - exchange cross section . at long times ,",
    "when the spin - polarization has decayed away , the measurement of the sign of @xmath16 will merely reflect spontaneous spin noise @xcite .",
    "this collision - induced sampling process will thus result in a distribution of measured precession frequencies , the width of which will be on the order of @xmath22 .",
    "this is the spin - exchange broadening that limits the precision with which one can measure @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "from the view point of quantum measurements performed on an atom , the spin - exchange rate @xmath22 is identified with the measurement rate , i.e. the rate at which we extract information about the spin state of any given atom .",
    "an unexpected phenomenon is observed when @xmath23 : the width of the spin - resonance shrinks and scales as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this is the quantum zeno effect observed in the strongly interrogated atomic spin coherence .",
    "this dependence of the suppressed decoherence rate , i.e. the @xmath25 dependence is exactly the characteristic dependence of quantum zeno effect , as has been described in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "it can be rephrased as follows : if the rate of performing measurements on ( or extracting information from ) a coherently evolving quantum system is larger than the system s evolution rate , the measurement - induced back - action on the system is suppressed .    ) for @xmath26 .",
    "( c ) time evolution of the expectation value @xmath27 for @xmath28 and two different values of the measurement rate @xmath29 .",
    "the linear early - time dependence for @xmath30 is evident .",
    "( d ) same as before , but for longer times.,width=8 ]",
    "towards a simplified quantitative argument , we describe the effects of collision - induced measurements on the atomic spin state by the density matrix equation d / dt =- i[h,]-k[s_x,[s_x,]][eq : rho ] where @xmath31 is the zeeman interaction hamiltonian , and the second ( dissipative ) term takes into account @xcite the measurement of @xmath32 at a rate @xmath29 . in fig . [ fig1](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) we show the decay rates @xmath33 and precession frequencies @xmath34 of the four complex eigenvalues of ( [ eq : rho ] ) , which are of the form @xmath35 .",
    "the calculation was performed for constant @xmath26 .",
    "it is evident that one of the decay rates is suppressed when the measurement rate @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c , d ) we show the time dependence of the expectation value @xmath27 , for two different values of the measurement rate @xmath29 . it is seen that while at small values of @xmath29 the coherent precession of @xmath27 decays at a rate proportional to @xmath29 , at high measurement rates @xmath27 survives for a much longer time ( in this simple model the precession frequency @xmath34 is also suppressed ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) in particular , the initial linear decay ( in the case @xmath30 ) is clearly seen .    in reality , the effect of spin - exchange is described by a non - linear density matrix equation , that leads to similarly suppressed decay rates @xcite .",
    "moreover , spin - exchange collisions are different from the kind of measurements usually considered @xcite in that they do not collapse the wavefunction to the initial state , but make atoms quantum - jump from one ground - state hyperfine - multiplet to the other .",
    "the larmor spin precession has opposite sense in the these two multiplets .",
    "however , the analog of the probability to find the system in the initial state which is usually considered in quantum zeno effects @xcite is in this case found in the correlation of the spin - coherence , i.e. the overlap between an unperturbed spin precession and one including such collision - induced jumps . specifically ,",
    "if we write @xmath37 for the expectation value of the pauli operator @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the same function but including the occurrence of a jump in the precession frequency from @xmath17 to @xmath40 at time @xmath41 , then the average value of the correlation @xmath42 can be approximated for @xmath43 by p1-()^2 after @xmath0 such independent collisions taking place in a total time interval @xmath44 , the overlap between the initial unperturbed precession and the one including @xmath0 collisions will have decayed to p=^ne^-(^2/4)t thus we recover the decay rate @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the spin - exchange rate .",
    "this rather simplified analog of the rigorous statistical treatment @xcite of spin - exchange collisions is meant to point out the dependence @xmath25 common to all appearances of the quantum zeno effect in quantum systems characterized by an intrinsic frequency scale @xmath17 and a measurement rate @xmath47 .",
    "contrary to spin - exchange collisions which dissipate only spin coherence , there is another kind of binary collisions relaxing populations as well as coherences : the spin - destruction collisions @xcite , described by an interaction of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the unit vector along the internuclear axis , and @xmath50 is a function of the internuclear distance . in the first term of @xmath51",
    "we have the direct participation of the environment degrees of freedom , i.e. it is this term that opens the loss - channel of spin - angular momentum into translational angular momentum .",
    "it is clear that not even the sign of @xmath16 can be inferred by observing the phase jump of atom 2 spin , since the effective magnetic field seen by atom 2 is now proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "since these two terms are of similar magnitude , the information loss into the environment is dominant no matter what the collision rate is .",
    "this broadening is accompanied by the so - called spin - exchange frequency shift , that limits the accuracy of atomic clocks .",
    "however this effect is not relevant for the present discussion . for more details",
    "see ref . @xcite ."
