    "multiplicative processes have been well studied in different contexts and widely applied to various research fields , such as the biological , social , and economic systems @xcite .",
    "one of the major interests in these processes is the generation of power laws @xcite , which have been observed in many natural domains and indicate the properties of scale invariance and universality .",
    "in fact , the investigations of power law behaviors in systems with stochastic multiplicative dynamics can be traced back to decades ago , and the underlying physical mechanisms are still to be understood .    for the applications in financial problems",
    ", the assumption of multiplicative property for the individual capital investments @xmath0 ( the index @xmath1 may correspond to various investors / traders or companies ( stocks ) in the market ) leads to a term @xmath2 appearing in the dynamics of wealth / capital evolution .",
    "that is , the individual capital @xmath0 at time @xmath3 is proportional to the invested capital itself .",
    "the random factor @xmath4 reflects the relative gain / loss incurred by individuals between time @xmath5 and @xmath3 , and is chosen from a probability distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the pareto power law distribution @xcite of individual wealths @xmath7 @xmath8 has been found in many of the previous studies of multiplicative processes @xcite , which all follow the above dynamics ( [ eqmul ] ) ( plus some additional crucial dynamical elements that we will discuss later ) , and been verified repeatedly in the last hundred years in most of the capitalistic societies , e.g. , for individual income and wealth @xcite , size of business firms @xcite , etc . in spite of the significant fluctuations in the total wealth ( with occasional spectacular booms and crashes ) , the exponent @xmath9",
    "was observed typically in the range @xmath10 , i.e. , within the stable lvy regime @xcite .    besides the above distribution property of individual wealth , we are more interested in studying the relative fluctuations of the total wealth @xmath11 , which may represent the capitalization ( total market value ) of a company , or the market price of a stock ( when normalized to the total number of shares that stock has on the market ) , or the market index .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath12 over arbitrary periods of time @xmath13 define the market returns @xmath14 during these time periods : @xmath15 which have attracted much attention in recent financial studies , in particular for their statistical properties @xcite .",
    "there are some empirical features generic for different financial markets , including :    * the power - law decay of probability density of returns @xmath16 @xmath17 in tail region , but with exponent @xmath18 different from that of wealth distribution ( [ eqpw ] ) , i.e. , outside the lvy regime @xcite . for larger @xmath16 values",
    ", @xmath19 can be fitted by an exponential in some observations @xcite ; * the very short range ( about a few minutes ) correlation of returns and long - range persistence for correlation of square or absolute value of returns ( so - called volatility clustering ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to not only reproduce these stylized facts through microscopic models , but also understand the intrinsic mechanisms dominating the processes .",
    "the framework we use to describe the dynamics of financial systems is the generalized lotka - volterra ( glv ) model proposed by one of us a few years ago @xcite : @xmath20 with the average wealth @xmath21 .",
    "the multiplicative property at the individual level , i.e. , eq .  ( [ eqmul ] ) , is expressed in the first r.h.s . term , and the second term represents the property of wealth at the social level , which may correspond to the social security , subsidies , or funded services , and can also be interpreted as arising from the diffusion of wealth between agents ( by services , taxes , etc . ) .",
    "this term is set to be proportional to the average wealth @xmath22 with an important coupling parameter @xmath23 , supplying the correlation and coupling between investors or companies that is crucial for the distribution properties of wealth and wealth fluctuation shown below .",
    "generally , the last term @xmath24 which corresponds to the competition in the market , does not qualitatively affect the properties of the model @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we set it @xmath25 in the present study .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath26    note that in this stochastic multiplicative system an asynchronous updating mechanism @xcite is used , due to the fact that in a real market the capitals of different agents or companies are not updated simultaneously .",
    "thus , at each discrete time @xmath5 , one of the elements @xmath27 is chosen randomly and updated according to eq .",
    "( [ eqwi ] ) , while the other @xmath0 s keep unchanged .",
    "moreover , the random factor @xmath28 is taken in a rather narrow range around @xmath29 , since in practice the price returns for very small time intervals are usually rather small .",
    "the system described by eq .",
    "( [ eqwi ] ) does not approach a steady state ; instead the total wealth grows ( or decays ) exponentially with superimposed fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath30 with @xmath31 depending on @xmath23 as well as the mean and standard deviation of @xmath28 distribution . nevertheless , the instantaneous values of wealth ( or the relative value @xmath32 ) fulfill the pareto power - law distribution ( [ eqpw ] ) , with exponent @xmath33 @xcite , that is , inside the stable lvy regime .",
    "more interesting results for this multiplicative system are obtained by studying the wealth fluctuations ( i.e. , returns ) @xmath14 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqreturn ] ) .",
    "( note that due to the growth effect of total wealth @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) in this model , the return in ( [ eqreturn ] ) should be detrended , that is , change by a constant : @xmath36 . ) for a certain time interval @xmath13 , the return @xmath14 can be written as @xmath37$]@xmath38 $ ] according to eq .",
    "( [ eqwi ] ) @xcite .",
    "since the relative value of wealth @xmath39 at each step is small and generally @xmath40 is in a narrow range around @xmath25 , one obtains that the properties of the ( detrended ) return @xmath41 are the resultant of @xmath13 steps walk @xmath42 with step sizes governed by power law distribution ( [ eqpw ] ) with cut - off effect .    for @xmath43",
    "the distribution of returns differs from that of the relative wealth @xmath32 only by a random factor @xmath44 , and then displays a similar power law behavior ( [ eqpr ] ) with exponent @xmath45 and a sharp peak around @xmath25 . as @xmath13 increases ,",
    "the consequence of @xmath13 step walks described by eq .",
    "( [ eqwalk ] ) is the smoothening of this tip .",
    "note that for any finite @xmath46 the distribution of @xmath32 is not a perfect power law even if one assumes that of @xmath0 to be so , since this distribution is truncated from above : @xmath47 , shown as a bending in a log - log plot for very large values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have proven @xcite that this upper cut - off effect leads to an exponential decay for extremely large values of returns and for very wide range of interval @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the process described by eq .",
    "( [ eqwalk ] ) looks like a truncated lvy walk leading to similar power laws for different @xmath13 and slow convergence to gaussian @xcite .",
    "however , our studies below indicate a more complicated situation , that is , this process is different from the ordinary lvy walk due to the coupling between step sizes .    the numerical results of eq .",
    "( [ eqwi ] ) for the distribution of returns @xmath14 ( [ eqreturn ] ) are shown in figs .",

    "( [ eqpr ] ) can be found in the log - log plots of the distribution ( see figs .",
    "[ figr500 ] ( b ) and [ figr5000 ] ) , and interestingly , exponents much larger than that of the wealth distribution ( [ eqpw ] ) are obtained . for small interval @xmath13 ,",
    "the exponent @xmath52 is within the stable lvy regime , i.e. , @xmath53 , while for large intervals ( @xmath54 ) we obtain the result consistent with the recent empirical observations for both the stock index ( german dax @xcite and s&p 500 @xcite ) and individual stocks @xcite , that is , the effective exponent @xmath18 outside the lvy regime .",
    "similar to the findings of real markets @xcite , the exponent increases very slightly with the increase of the time interval , due to the very slow convergence to gaussian , as shown in figs .",
    "[ figr500 ] and [ figr5000 ] .",
    "the extension of this power - law region with exponent @xmath18 depends on the size @xmath46 of the multiplicative system . by comparing the results in fig .",
    "[ figr500 ] for @xmath55 with that in fig .",
    "[ figr5000 ] for @xmath56 , one can find that the range of the power - law scaling is longer for larger systems .",
    "this phenomenon is attributed to the exponential truncation effect discussed above for finite @xmath46 , which appears more obvious for smaller system . as observed in the log - log plots , the deviation and",
    "bend - down from a straight line occurs for large @xmath16 , which has been found very recently in the hang seng index ( hsi ) of hong kong @xcite if one skips the data of first 20 minutes in daily opening .",
    "the similar effect of finite size @xmath46 has been found in some microscopic models , in particular the cont - bouchaud percolation - type model @xcite , where the @xmath18 power - law exponent is obtained over an intermediate region which becomes infinitely long for infinite large market size and computer time , while the asymptotic return distribution is expected to be a ( stretched ) exponential decay in the tails .    however , different from the percolation model , the exponent @xmath52 for large interval @xmath13 decreases with increasing size @xmath46 in our system . as shown in figs .",
    "[ figr500 ] ( a ) and [ figr5000 ] , @xmath57 for @xmath55 , and @xmath58 for @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath59 ( not shown here ) @xmath60 , which is the border of the stable lvy regime .",
    "therefore , the property of returns distribution is size - dependent , and one can obtain that the effective @xmath46 for real market is not very large according to the high empirical @xmath52 value .    although the value of the exponent @xmath9 for wealth distribution depends on the parameters of the system , the behaviors of the @xmath18 power - law scaling for return distribution can exist for different parameters ( e.g. , coupling parameter @xmath23 and random factor @xmath28 ) corresponding to @xmath61 . when increasing the value of @xmath23 , one still obtains the @xmath18 power - law behaviors with larger @xmath52 value and longer extension for the same @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ figr500 ] @xmath55 and @xmath49 ( with the corresponding @xmath9 about @xmath50 ) , we have @xmath62 but with a rather limit range of power law regime , while for larger @xmath63 as well as the same @xmath46 and range of @xmath28 ( with @xmath9 about @xmath64 ) @xmath65 is obtained , and more importantly , the power law regime is much longer ( close to @xmath66 orders of magnitude ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figra23 ] .",
    "these results of @xmath18 are nontrivial , and different from the expectation that the wealth @xmath0 and the fluctuation @xmath16 should have tails obeying the similar power law , since a random walk similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqwalk ] ) with steps of sizes dominated by lvy - like distribution with finite variance still leads to a behavior within the stable lvy regime before the crossover to a gaussian process @xcite .",
    "however , this expectation is only valid for the random walk with statistically independent step sizes , while for the multiplicative process ( [ eqwi ] ) , there are cross - correlations between the relative wealths @xmath67 comprising the returns in eq .",
    "( [ eqwalk ] ) at each micro - step @xmath68 .",
    "this can be verified by studying the properties of time series @xmath32 , where @xmath0 refers to the newly updated wealth at each time @xmath5 . as expected , the probability distribution of the walk process of eq .",

    "[ figr500 ] , [ figr5000 ] , and [ figra23 ] . however , if randomizing the time series of @xmath32 , which corresponds to eliminate all the possible correlations but keep the distribution form of step sizes , and then calculating the distribution of @xmath69 due to eq .",
    "( [ eqwalk ] ) , one obtains the completely different results , that is , the convergence to gaussian is faster and only the power law regions with lvy - like exponent @xmath70 can be found , similar to the process of ordinary truncated lvy flight @xcite .    to directly calculate the cross - correlations between the relative updated wealths @xmath32 , we use the autocorrelation function of @xmath71 for some variable @xmath72 .",
    "although there is no correlation of relative wealths ( @xmath73 in ( [ eqcorr ] ) ) , the nonzero and positive correlation of the square @xmath74 is found with long persistence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcorrwi ] , verifying the existence of the coupling between step sizes of the walk ( [ eqwalk ] ) for this multiplicative system .",
    "these correlations are attributed to the social term @xmath75 introduced in our system ( [ eqwi ] ) , supplying the coupling between different wealths . a larger value of @xmath23 leads to an enhancement of cross - correlations , and then of @xmath18 behavior , including the value of @xmath52 and the extension of power - law region ( see fig .   [ figra23 ] ) .",
    "even when keeping the value of @xmath9 for wealth , the correlation of @xmath74 increases with larger @xmath23 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figcorrwi ] , different values of coupling parameter @xmath23 and different range of @xmath28 are chosen so that the corresponding @xmath9 keeps the same value @xmath50 , and from bottom to top the correlations increase with the increasing values of @xmath23 .    as the consequence of cross - correlations between @xmath39 , the volatility correlations for @xmath69 ( which is the weight - sum of @xmath39 shown in eq .",

    "@xmath78 the value is around 0 , consistent with empirical observations @xcite .",
    "this property of volatility clustering can be also reproduced in some microscopic models , but there an extra dynamics like diffusion of traders or feedback between price change and trading activity is needed @xcite , while in this asynchronous system it is obtained intrinsically .",
    "it is interesting to relate the scales @xmath13 and @xmath46 here with that of the real markets .",
    "the more natural time unit of measurement is @xmath79 , which corresponds to average updating interval of stocks or agents . to describe the properties of market index ,",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom @xmath46 could be interpreted as the major companies capitalization in the market , while for individual stocks @xmath46 may correspond to the important agents dominating the stock price .",
    "thus , the somewhat different behavior ( value of @xmath52 , exponential cut - off , etc . ) found in different markets and stocks may be attributed to different effective @xmath46 . moreover , according to our results in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the effective @xmath46 is not very large ( that is , the finite size effect is significant ) in real market , indicating a phenomenon that is also found in some microscopic models @xcite : it is a limited number of important players , not millions of small traders , who determine the market .    in summary , we have shown that the stochastic multiplicative model ( [ eqwi ] ) reproduces two different power law behaviors found in reality for the wealth distribution ( [ eqpw ] ) and the return distribution ( [ eqpr ] ) , as well as the volatility clustering .",
