    "proteins are fascinating molecules due to their ability to play many roles in biological systems .",
    "their functions often involve complex configurational changes .",
    "therefore the familiar aphorism that `` form is function '' should rather be replaced by a view of the `` dynamic personalities of proteins''@xcite .",
    "this is why proteins are also intriguing for theoreticians because they provide a variety of yet unsolved questions .",
    "besides the dynamics of protein folding , the rise in the time averaged mean square fluctuation @xmath0 occurring at temperatures around @xmath1 , sometimes called the `` protein dynamic transition '' @xcite is arguably the most considerable candidate in the search of unifying principles in protein dynamics .",
    "protein studies lead to the concept of _ energy landscape _ @xcite . according to this viewpoint",
    "a protein is a system which explores a complex landscape in a highly multidimensional space and some of its properties can be related to an incomplete exploration of the phase space .",
    "the protein glass transition , in which the protein appears to `` freeze '' when it is cooled down to about @xmath2k is among them .",
    "protein folding too can be related to this energy landscape .",
    "the famous kinetic limitation known as the levinthal paradox , associated to the difficulty to find the native state among a huge number of possible configurations , is partly solved by the concept of a funneled landscape which provides a bias towards the native state .",
    "these considerations suggest that the dynamics of the exploration of protein phase space deserves investigation , particularly at low temperature where the dynamic transition occurs .",
    "but , in spite of remarkable experimental progress which allows to `` watch protein in action in real time at atomic resolution '' @xcite , experimental studies at this level of detail are nevertheless extremely difficult .",
    "further understanding from models can help in analyzing the observations and developing new concepts .",
    "however , studies involving computer modeling to study the dynamics of protein fluctuations are not trivial either because the range of time scales involved is very large .",
    "this is why many meso - scale models , which describe the protein at scales that are larger than the atom , have been proposed . yet , their validity to adequately describe the qualitative features of a real protein glass remains to be tested .    in this paper we examine a model with an intermediate level of complexity .",
    "this frustrated g model @xcite is an off - lattice model showing fluctuations at a large range of time scales .",
    "it is though simple enough to allow the investigation of time scales which can be up to @xmath3 times larger than the time scales of small amplitude vibrations at the atomic level .",
    "the model , which includes a slight frustration in the dihedral angle potential which does not assume a minimum for the positions of the experimentally determined structure , exhibits a much richer behavior than a standard g model .",
    "besides folding one observes a rise of fluctuations above a specific temperature , analogous to a dynamical transition @xcite , and the coexistence of two folded states .",
    "this model has been widely used and it is therefore important to assess to what extent it can describe the qualitative features of protein dynamics beyond the analysis of folding for which it was originally designed .",
    "this is why we focus our attention on its low - temperature properties in an attempt to determine if a fairly simple model can provide some insight on the protein dynamical transition .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to clarify the origin of the transition in the computer model , and to determine similarities and differences with respect to experimental observations .",
    "although the calculations are performed with a specific model , the methods are more general and even raise some questions for experiments , especially concerning the non - equilibrium properties .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical findings relating to the  dynamical transitionfrom previous studies @xcite are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . as",
    "a very large body of experimental studies of protein dynamics emanates from neutron scattering experiments , it is rational to seek a connection between theory and experiment by studying the most relevant experimental observable for dynamics , the incoherent structure factor ( isf ) .",
    "we calculate the isf from molecular dynamics simulations of the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : strfact ] .",
    "we show that its main features can be well reproduced by a theoretical analysis based on the one - phonon approximation , which indicates that , at low temperature , the dynamics of the protein within this model takes place in a single minimum of the energy landscape .",
    "[ sec : is ] proceeds to an inherent structure analysis to examine how the transitions among energy states start to play a role when temperature increases . as the freezing of the protein dynamics at low temperature is often called a `` glass transition '' , this raises the question of the properties of the model protein in non - equilibrium situations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fdt ] we examine the violation of the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem after a sudden cooling of the protein .",
    "we find that the effective temperature of the quenched protein , deduced from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) deviates from the temperature of the thermostat , however it relaxes towards the actual temperature with an an arrhenius behavior as the waiting time increases .",
    "this would imply that the dynamics of the protein model is very slow but not actually glassy .",
    "this method could be useful to distinguish very slow dynamics from glassy dynamics , in experimental cases as well as in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] summarizes and discusses our results .",
    "following earlier studies @xcite we chose to study a small protein containing the most common types of secondary structure elements ( @xmath4helix , @xmath5sheets and loops ) , protein @xmath6 , the @xmath7 domain of immunoglobulin binding protein @xcite ( protein data bank code 2gb1 ) .",
    "it contains 56 residues , with one @xmath8helix and four @xmath5strands forming a @xmath9sheet .",
    "we describe it by an off - lattice g model with a slight frustration which represents its geometry in terms of a single particle per residue , centered at the location of each @xmath10 carbon in the experimentally determined tertiary structure .",
    "the interactions between these residues do not distinguish between the type of amino acids .",
    "details on the simulation process and the parametrization of the model are presented in the appendix . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", this model appears to exhibit properties which are reminiscent of the protein dynamical transition .",
    "this shows up when one examines the temperature dependence of its mean - squared fluctuations @xcite by calculating the variance @xmath11 of the residue distances to the center of mass as a function of temperature , defined by @xmath12 here , @xmath13 denotes the number of residues , and @xmath14 is distance of residue @xmath15 with respect to the instantaneous center of of mass .",
    "the average @xmath16 of the observable @xmath17 is the time average @xmath18 . the variances of 20 trajectories ( langevin dynamics simulations , each @xmath19 time units long ) were averaged for each temperature point ( @xmath20 denotes the average over independent initial conditions ) .     as a function of temperature for protein g. data adapted from @xcite .",
    "the temperatures marked @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the temperatures studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : is].,width=287 ]    figure [ fig : deltar2 ] shows the evolution of @xmath24 as a function of temperature .",
    "it exhibits a crossover in the fluctuations in the temperature range @xmath25 $ ] resembling the transition observed for hydrated proteins in neutron scattering and mssbauer spectroscopy experiments @xcite , the so - called _",
    "dynamical transition_. above @xmath26 , the fluctuations increase quickly with temperature whereas a smaller , linear , growth is observed below .",
    "one may wonder whether the complexity of the protein structure , reflected by the g model , is sufficient to lead to a dynamical transition or whether , notwithstanding the resemblance of the onset of fluctuations in the present model and the experimentally determined transition , different physical and not necessarily related events may contribute to the curves which by coincidence look similar .",
    "one can already note that , for a folding temperature in the range @xmath27 , the range @xmath28 corresponds to @xmath29 , lower than the experimentally observed transition occurring around @xmath30 .",
    "if it had been confirmed the observation of a dynamical transition in a fairly simple protein model would have been very useful to shine a new light on this transition which is still not fully understood .",
    "it is generally agreed that it is hydration - dependent @xcite , but still different directions for a microscopic interpretation are being pursued , suggesting the existence @xcite or non - existence @xcite of a transition in the solvent coinciding at the dynamical transition temperature .",
    "recently , a completely different mechanism based on percolation theory for the hydration layer has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of the interaction between the solvent and proteins , and the driving factor behind the transition , hence still remain to be understood .",
    "the dynamical transition has often been called the _ protein glass transition _ due its similarity with some physical properties of structural glasses at low temperatures . in particular ,",
    "it was pointed out that , for both glasses and protein solutions , the transition goes along with a crossover towards non - exponential relaxation rates at low temperatures .",
    "the comparison is however vague since the glass transition itself and notably its mechanism are ongoing subjects of research and debate .",
    "our goal in this paper is to clarify the origin of the numerically observed transition , which moreover gives hints on the possibilities and limits of protein computer models .",
    "if computer models of proteins are to be useful they must go beyond a simple determination of the dynamics of the atoms , and make the link with experimental observations .",
    "this is particularly important for the `` dynamical transition '' because its nature in a real protein is not known at the level of the atomic trajectories .",
    "it is only observed indirectly through the signals provided by experiments .",
    "therefore a valid analysis of the transition observed in the computer model must examine it in the same context , i.e.  determine its consequences on the experimental observations .    along with nmr and mssbauer spectroscopy ,",
    "neutron scattering methods have been among the most versatile and valuable tools to provide insight on the internal motion of proteins @xcite .",
    "indeed , the thermal neutron wavelength being of the order of ngstrms and the kinetic energy of the order of @xmath31s , neutrons provide an adequate probe matching the length- and frequency scales of atomic motion in proteins .",
    "an aspect brought forward in the discussion of the dynamical transition in view of the properties of glassy materials is the existence of a _ boson peak _ at low frequencies in neutron scattering spectra @xcite .",
    "such a broad peak appears to be a characteristic feature of unstructured materials as compared to the spectra of crystals .      in",
    "neutron scattering the vibrational and conformational changes in proteins appear as a quasielastic contribution to the dynamic structure factor @xmath32 which contains crucial information about the dynamics on different time- and length scales of the system . in scattering experiments",
    "one measures the double - differential scattering cross section @xmath33 which gives the probability of finding a neutron in the solid angle element @xmath34 with an energy exchange @xmath35 after scattering .",
    "the total cross - section of the experiment is obtained by integration over all angles and energies . neglecting magnetic interaction and only considering the short - range nuclear forces ,",
    "the isotropic scattering is characterized by a single parameter @xmath36 , the scattering length of the atomic species @xmath15 @xcite , which can be a complex number with a non - vanishing imaginary part accounting for absorption of the neutron .",
    "if one defines the average over different spin states @xmath37 as the coherent scattering length , and the root mean square deviation @xmath38 as the incoherent scattering length , the double - differential cross section arising from the scattering of a monochromatic beam of neutrons with incident wave vector @xmath39 and final wave vector @xmath40 by @xmath13 nuclei of the sample can be expressed as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the wave vector transfer in the scattering process and @xmath43 denote the time - dependent positions of the sample nuclei and the coherent and incoherent dynamical structure factors are @xmath44 the coherent structure factor contains contributions from the position of all nuclei .",
    "the interference pattern of @xmath45 contains the average ( static ) structural information on the sample , whereas the incoherent structure factor @xmath46 monitors the average of atomic motions as it is mathematically equivalent to the fourier transform in space and time of the particle density autocorrelation function . in experiments on biological samples ,",
    "incoherent scattering from hydrogens dominates the experimental spectra @xcite unless deuteration of the molecule and/or solvent are used .",
    "since the g - model represents a reduced description of the protein and the locations of the individual atoms in the residues are not resolved , we use  effective  incoherent weights of equal value for the effective particles of the model located in the position of the @xmath10-atoms .",
    "such a coarse grained view assumes that the average number of hydrogens atoms and their location in the residues is homogeneous , which is of course a crude approximation in particular in view of the extension and the motion of the side chains .",
    "these approximations are nevertheless acceptable here as we do not intend to provide a quantitative comparison with experimental results considering the simplifications and the resulting limitations of the model .",
    "we generated langevin and nos - hoover dynamic trajectories of length @xmath47 time units , i.e.  about 1000 periods of the slowest vibrational mode of the protein , after an equilibration of equal length for protein g at temperatures in the interval @xmath48 $ ] . to compute the incoherent structure factor for the g - model of protein g , we use",
    "_ nmoldyn _ @xcite to analyze the molecular dynamics trajectories generated at different temperatures .",
    "the data are spatially averaged over @xmath49 wave vectors sampling spheres of fixed modules @xmath50 @xmath51 , and the fourier transformation is smoothed by a gaussian window of width @xmath52 of the full length of the trajectory .",
    "prior to the analysis , a root - mean square displacement alignment of the trajectory onto the reference structure at time @xmath53 is performed using virtual molecular dynamics ( vmd ) @xcite .",
    "such a procedure is necessary in order to remove the effects of global rotation and translation of the molecule .",
    "figure [ fig425 ] shows the frequency dependence of the incoherent structure factor @xmath54 for a fixed wave vector @xmath55 @xmath51 for a simulation with the nos - hoover thermostat . on fig .",
    "[ fig425]-a , the evolution of the low frequency range of the structure is shown for a range of temperatures including the supposed dynamic transition region @xmath56 $ ] . at low temperatures up to @xmath57 ,",
    "individual modes are clearly distinguishable and become broadened as temperatures increases .",
    "the slowest mode , located around @xmath58 is also the highest in amplitude .",
    "it has a time constant of about @xmath59 in reduced units ( @xmath60ps ) .",
    "these well - defined lines are observed to be shifting towards lower frequencies with increasing temperature , similar to the phonon frequency shifts that are frequently observed in crystalline solids .",
    "as we show in the following section , the location of these lines can be calculated from a harmonic approximation associated to a single potential energy minimum .",
    "therefore , the shift in frequency and the appearance of additional modes can be seen as a signature of increasingly anharmonic dynamics involving several minima associated to different conformational substates .",
    "to control temperature in the molecular dynamics simulations , several types of numerical thermostats were used .",
    "most of the calculations use underdamped langevin simulations @xcite with a time step @xmath61t.u . and friction constants in the range @xmath62 .",
    "the mass of all the residues is assumed to be equal to @xmath63 .",
    "some calculations were also performed with the multi - thermostat nose - hoover algorithm using the specifications defined in @xcite .    for simulation purposes ,",
    "the variables in the g - model are chosen dimensionless ( reduced units ) .",
    "lengths are expressed in units of @xmath64 representing ngstrms , and the average mass of an amino - acid , @xmath65da , has been expressed as @xmath66 units of mass of the model . as the empirical potentials are defined at the mesoscopic scale of the amino - acids , values for the interaction constants in the effective potentials",
    "can not be easily estimated in absolute units .",
    "it is possible to estimate the energy scale of the model by comparing the reduced folding temperature of the g - model with a realistic order of magnitude of the folding temperature @xmath67 in units of @xmath68 and setting @xmath69 where the variables on the left - hand side are given in si units ( @xmath67 is the estimate of the folding temperature ) , and unprimed variables are written in reduced units ; @xmath70 is the required energy scale in units of @xmath71 to match between both . in our calculations",
    "@xmath72 ( meaning that reduced temperatures are expressed in reduced energy units ) and @xmath73 is deduced from equilibrium simulations .",
    "then a simple dimensional analysis gives the time unit of the model as @xmath74 one arrives at an estimated time unit of @xmath75ps . in the paper",
    "we refer to @xmath76ps as the unit of time ( t.u . ) for the simulations of the g - model , keeping in mind that this can merely be seen as an order of magnitude in view of the approximations that lead to this number .",
    "the dissimilarity factor is a weighted distance map between two conformations .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath78 be two conformations of the protein ( for our purpose @xmath78 will be the native structure ) and @xmath79 , @xmath80 the distance between residues @xmath15 and @xmath81 in these conformations .",
    "the dissimilarity @xmath82 between the two conformations is defined by @xmath83 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the distances between residues @xmath15 and @xmath81 in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 conformations and @xmath84 an integer which determines how much residues which are far apart contribute .",
    "we use here @xmath85 . in this article",
    "the reference conformation a is chosen as the nmr structure , see @xcite for details ."
