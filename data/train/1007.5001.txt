    "search for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments ( rhice ) has reached a very exciting stage with the ongoing experiments at rhic and with the upcoming heavy - ion experiments at the large hadron collider .",
    "no one doubts that the qgp phase has already been created at rhic but conclusive evidence for the same is still lacking .",
    "many signatures have been proposed for the detection of the qgp phase @xcite and these have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally . along with continued investigation of these important signatures of qgp , there is a need for investigating novel signals exploring qualitatively non - trivial features of the qgp phase and/or the quark - hadron phase transition .    with this view we focus on the non - trivial vacuum structure of the qgp phase which arises when one uses the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath1 as the order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "this order parameter transforms non - trivially under the center @xmath0 of the color su(3 ) group and is non - zero above the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this breaks the global @xmath0 symmetry spontaneously above @xmath2 , while the symmetry is restored below @xmath2 in the confining phase where this order parameter vanishes . in the qgp phase , due to spontaneous breaking of the discrete @xmath0 symmetry ,",
    "one gets domain walls ( interfaces ) which interpolate between different @xmath0 vacua .",
    "the properties and physical consequences of these @xmath0 interfaces have been discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these interfaces should not be taken as physical objects in the minkowski space @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has also been subject of discussion whether it makes sense to talk about this @xmath0 symmetry in the presence of quarks @xcite . however , we will follow the approach where the presence of quarks is interpreted as leading to explicit breaking of @xmath0 symmetry , lifting the degeneracy of different @xmath0 vacua @xcite .",
    "thus , with quarks , even planar @xmath0 interfaces do not remain static and move away from the region with the unique true vacuum .",
    "our main discussion will be for the pure gauge theory which we discuss first .",
    "later we will briefly comment on the situation with quarks . a detailed study with inclusion of quark effects",
    "is postponed for a future work .    in earlier works",
    "some of us had shown that there are novel topological string defects which form at the intersection of the three @xmath0 interfaces .",
    "these strings are embedded in the qgp phase and their cores consist of the confining phase .",
    "structure of these strings and interfaces were discussed in these earlier works @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that reflection of quarks from collapsing @xmath0 interfaces can lead to large scale baryon inhomogeneities in the early universe @xcite .",
    "this effect is also utilized to argue for @xmath3 enhancement of quarks of heavy flavor ( consecutively corresponding hadrons ) in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we carry out numerical simulation of formation of these @xmath0 interfaces and associated strings at the initial confinement - deconfinement transition which is believed to occur during the pre - equilibrium stage in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments . for the purpose of numerical simulation",
    "we will model this stage as a quasi - equilibrium stage with an effective temperature which first rises ( with rapid particle production ) to a maximum temperature @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the critical temperature for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition , and then decreases due to continued plasma expansion .",
    "we use the effective potential for the polyakov loop expectation value @xmath1 as proposed by pisarski @xcite to study the confinement - deconfinement ( c - d ) phase transition . within this model ,",
    "the c - d transition is weakly first order . even though lattice results show that quark - hadron transition is most likely a smooth cross - over at zero chemical potential , in the present work we will use this first order transition model to discuss the dynamical details of quark - hadron transition .",
    "one reason for this is that our study is in the context of relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments ( rhice ) where the baryon chemical potential is not zero . for not too small values of the chemical potential ,",
    "the quark - hadron phase transition is expected to be of first order , so this may be the case relevant for us any way ( especially when collision energy is not too high ) .",
    "further , our main interest is in determining the structure of the network of z(3 ) domain walls and strings resulting during the phase transition .",
    "these objects will form irrespective of the nature of the transition , resulting entirely from the finite correlation lengths in a fast evolving system , as shown by kibble @xcite .",
    "the kibble mechanism was first proposed for the formation of topological defects in the context of the early universe @xcite , but is now utilized extensively for discussing topological defects production in a wide variety of systems from condensed matter physics to cosmology @xcite .",
    "essential ingredient of the kibble mechanism is the existence of uncorrelated domains of the order parameter which result after every phase transition occurring in finite time due to finite correlation length .",
    "a first order transition allows easy implementation of the resulting domain structure especially when the transition proceeds via bubble nucleation . with this view",
    ", we use the polyakov loop model as in @xcite to model the phase transition and confine ourselves with temperature / time ranges so that the first order quark - hadron transition proceeds via bubble nucleation .",
    "the @xmath0 wall network and associated strings ( as mentioned above ) formed during this early confinement - deconfinement phase transition evolve in an expanding plasma with decreasing temperature .",
    "eventually when the temperature drops below the deconfinement - confinement phase transition temperature @xmath2 , these @xmath0 walls and associated strings will melt away",
    ". however they may leave their signatures in the form of extended regions of energy density fluctuations ( as well as @xmath3 enhancement of heavy - flavor hadrons @xcite ) .",
    "we make estimates of these energy density fluctuations which can be compared with the experimental data .",
    "especially interesting will be to look for extended regions of large energy densities in space - time reconstruction of hadron density ( using hydrodynamic models ) . in our model , we expect energy density fluctuations in event averages ( representing high energy density regions of domain walls / strings ) , as well as event - by - event fluctuations as the number / geometry of domain walls / strings and even the number of qgp bubbles , varies from one event to the other .",
    "a detailed analysis of energy fluctuations , especially the event - by - event fluctuations , is postponed for a future work .",
    "we also determine the distribution / shape of @xmath0 wall network and its evolution .",
    "in particular , our results provide an estimate of domain wall velocities ( for the situations studied ) to range from 0.5 to 0.8 .",
    "these results provide crucial ingredients for a detailed study of the effects of collapsing @xmath0 walls on the @xmath3 enhancement of heavy flavor hadrons @xcite in rhice .",
    "we emphasize that the presence of @xmath0 walls and string may not only provide a qualitatively new signature for the qgp phase in these experiments , it may provide the first ( and may be the only possible ) laboratory study of such topological objects in a relativistic quantum field theory system .    the paper is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the polyakov loop model of confinement - deconfinement phase transition . we describe the effective potential proposed by pisarski @xcite and discuss the structure of the @xmath0 walls and associated strings . in section iii",
    ", we present the physical picture of the formation of these @xmath0 walls and associated strings in the confinement - deconfinement phase transition via the kibble mechanism which provides a general framework for the production of topological defects in symmetry breaking phase transitions .",
    "we confine ourselves with temperature / time ranges so that the first order transition ( in the pisarski model ) proceeds via bubble nucleation .",
    "the other possibility of spinodal decomposition is of completely different nature and we will present it in a future work .",
    "( we mention here that a simulation of spinodal decomposition in polyakov loop model has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where fluctuations in the polyakov loop are investigated in detail . in comparison , the main focus of our work is on the topological objects , z(3 ) walls , and strings , and energy density fluctuations resulting therefrom . ) in section iv , we discuss the calculation of the profile of the critical bubble using bounce technique @xcite and also the estimates of nucleation rates for bubbles for the temperature / time range relevant for rhice .",
    "section v presents the numerical technique of simulating the phase transition via random nucleation of bubbles . in section",
    "vi we discuss the issue of the effects of quarks in our model .",
    "section vii presents the results of the numerical simulations .",

    "we discuss evolution of these quantities with changing temperature via bjorken s hydrodynamical model . in section viii",

    "section ix presents conclusions .",
    "we first discuss the case of pure su(n ) gauge theory .",
    "we will later discuss briefly the case with quarks .",
    "the order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement ( c - d ) phase transition is the expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath5 which is defined as    @xmath6    here p denotes the path ordering , g is the gauge coupling , and @xmath7 , where t is the temperature .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 being the generators of su(n ) in the fundamental representation , is the time component of the vector potential at spatial position @xmath10 and euclidean time @xmath11 . under a global z(n )",
    "symmetry transformation , @xmath5 transforms as    @xmath12    the expectation value of @xmath1 is related to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the free energy of an infinitely heavy test quark . for temperatures below @xmath2 , in the confined phase , the expectation value of polyakov loop is zero corresponding to the infinite free energy of an isolated test quark .",
    "( hereafter , we will use the same notation @xmath1 to denote the expectation value of the polyakov loop . )",
    "hence the z(n ) symmetry is restored below @xmath2 .",
    "z(n ) symmetry is broken spontaneously above @xmath2 where @xmath1 is non - zero corresponding to the finite free energy of the test quark .",
    "for qcd , @xmath15 , and we take the effective theory for the polyakov loop as proposed by pisarski @xcite . the effective lagrangian density is given by    @xmath16    @xmath17 is the effective potential for the polyakov loop    @xmath18    the values of various parameters are fixed to reproduce the lattice results @xcite for pressure and energy density of pure su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "we make the same choice and give those values below .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been taken as , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we will take the same value of @xmath23 for real qcd ( with three massless quark flavors ) , while the value of @xmath20 will be rescaled by a factor of 47.5/16 to account for the extra degrees of freedom relative to the degrees of freedom of pure su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath23 is temperature dependent @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 is taken as , @xmath24 , where r is taken as t/@xmath2 . with the coefficients chosen as above",
    ", the expectation value of order parameter approaches to @xmath25 for temperature @xmath26 . as in @xcite",
    ", we use the normalization such that the expectation value of order parameter @xmath27 goes to unity for temperature @xmath26 .",
    "hence the fields and the coefficients in @xmath28 are rescaled as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 to get proper normalization of @xmath27 .    for the parameters chosen as above",
    ", the value of @xmath2 is taken to be 182 mev .",
    "we see that the @xmath19 term in eq.(4 ) gives a cos(3@xmath33 ) term , leading to z(3 ) degenerate vacua structure . here , the shape of the potential is such that there exists a metastable vacuum upto a temperature @xmath34 250 mev .",
    "hence first order transition via bubble nucleation is possible only upto @xmath35 mev .",
    "we show the plot of v@xmath36 in @xmath37 direction in fig.(1a ) for a value of temperature t = 185 mev .",
    "this shows the metastable vacuum at @xmath38 .",
    "fig.(1b ) shows the structure of vacuum by plotting v(@xmath39 ) as a function of @xmath33 for fixed @xmath27 , where @xmath40 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath17 at @xmath41 mev .",

    ", @xmath40 corresponds to the absolute minimum of @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig.1 ]    in fig.(1b ) , the three degenerate vacua are separated by large barrier in between them . while going from one vacuum to another vacuum ,",
    "the field configuration is determined from the field equations . for the case of degenerate vacua",
    ", there are time independent solutions which have planar symmetry .",
    "these solutions are called domain wall . for the non - degenerate case , as will be appropriate for the case when quarks are included as dynamical degrees of freedom in discussing the quark hadron transition , the solutions of the interfaces separating these vacua will be similar to the bounce solutions @xcite , though the standard bounce techniques need to be extended for the case of complex scalar field .",
    "the resulting planar domain wall solutions will not be static . as mentioned above , we will be neglecting such effects of quarks , and",
    "hence will discuss the case of degenerate vacua only .",
    "later , in section vi , we will examine the justification of using the approximation of neglecting quark effects .",
    "in physical space , after the phase transition , regions with different z(3 ) vacua are separated by domain walls . inside a domain wall , @xmath49 becomes very small as @xmath50 @xcite . in ref.@xcite the intersection of the three z(3 ) domain walls",
    "was considered and , using topological arguments , it was then shown that at the line - like intersection of these interfaces , the order parameter @xmath1 should vanish .",
    "this leads to a topological string configuration with core of the string being in the confining phase .",
    "properties of these new string configurations were determined in @xcite using the model of eq.(3 ) .",
    "this string configuration is interesting , especially when we note that such a string has exactly reverse physical behavior compared to the standard qcd string .",
    "the qcd string exists in the confining phase , connecting quarks and antiquarks , or forming baryons , glueballs etc . inside the qcd string",
    ", the core region is expected to behave as a deconfined region .",
    "in contrast the string discussed in @xcite , arising at the intersection of z(3 ) walls , exists in the high temperature deconfined phase .",
    "its core is characterized by restored @xmath0 symmetry , implying that it is in the confined phase . to differentiate it with the standard qcd string ,",
    "this new string structure was called as _ the qgp string _ in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that although the standard qcd string breaks by creating quark - antiquark pairs , the qgp string can not break as it originates from topological arguments .",
    "this qgp string , thus should either form closed loops , or it should end at the boundary separating the deconfined phase from the confined phase .",
    "its structure is very similar to certain axionic strings discussed in the context of early universe @xcite .",
    "note that as these strings contain the confining phase ( with @xmath44 ) in the core , while they are embedded in the qgp phase , a transition from deconfining phase to the confining phase , in the presence of such strings may begin from regions near the strings .",
    "similarly , the presence of domain walls may lead to heterogeneous bubble nucleation in a first order quark - hadron transition .",
    "we will be studying the formation of z(3 ) domain walls and these qgp strings in the initial confinement - deconfinement phase transition , and their subsequent evolution .",
    "we now briefly describe the physical picture of the formation of topological defects via the kibble mechanism .",
    "kibble first gave a detailed theory of the formation of topological defects in symmetry breaking phase transitions in the context of the early universe @xcite .",
    "subsequently it was realized that the basic physics of kibble mechanism is applicable to every symmetry breaking transition , from low energy physics of condensed matter systems to high energy physics relevant for the early universe @xcite .",
    "basic physics of the kibble mechanism can be described as follows . after a spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transition ,",
    "the physical space consists of regions , called domains . in each domain",
    "the configuration of the order parameter field can be taken as nearly uniform while it varies randomly from one domain to another . in a numerical simulation",
    "where the phase transition is modeled to implement the kibble mechanism , typically the physical region is divided in terms of elementary domains of definite geometrical shape .",
    "the order parameter is taken to be uniform within the domain and random variations of order parameter field within the vacuum manifold are allowed from one domain to the other . the order parameter field configuration in between domains",
    "is assumed to be such that the variation of the order parameter field is minimum on the vacuum manifold ( the so - called geodesic rule ) . with this simple construction ,",
    "topological defects arise at the junctions of several domains if the variation of the order parameter in those domains traces a topologically non - trivial configuration in the vacuum manifold .",
    "see , ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of this approach .",
    "we , however , will follow a more detailed simulation as in ref.@xcite where the kibble mechanism was implemented in the context of a first order transition .",
    "bubbles of true vacuum ( determined from the bounce solution ) were randomly nucleated in the background of false vacuum .",
    "each bubble was taken to have the uniform orientation of the order parameter in the vacuum manifold , while the order parameter orientation varied randomly from one bubble to another .",
    "this provided the initial seed domains , as needed for the kibble mechanism .",
    "evolution of this initial configuration via the field equation led to expansion of bubbles which eventually coalesce and lead to the formation of topological defects at the junctions of bubbles when the order parameter develops appropriate variation ( winding ) in that region .",
    "important thing is that in this case one does not need to assume anything like the geodesic rule . as different bubbles come into contact during their expansion , the value of the order parameter in the intermediate region is automatically determined by the field equations .",
    "an important aspect of the kibble mechanism is that it does not crucially depend on the dynamical details of the phase transition .",
    "although the domain size depends on the dynamics of phase transitions , the defect number density ( per domain ) and type of topological defects produced via the kibble mechanism depends only on the topology of order parameter space and spatial dimensions .",
    "if the vacuum manifold m has disconnected components , then domain walls form . if it is multiply connected ( i.e. , if m contains unshrinkable loops ) , strings will form .",
    "when m contains closed two surfaces which can not be shrunk to a point , then monopoles will form in three dimensional physical space . in our case domain walls and",
    "string network will be produced in the qgp phase . as discussed above ,",
    "domain walls arise due to interpolation of field between different z(3 ) vacua . at the intersection of these interfaces",
    ", string is produced .",
    "as we explained in the introduction , we will study the z(3 ) domain wall and string formation with the first order transition model given by eq.(3 ) , such that the transition occurs via bubble nucleation .",
    "the semiclassical theory of decay of false vacuum at zero temperature has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the finite temperature extension of this theory was given in ref .",
    "the process of barrier tunneling leads to the appearance of bubbles of the new phase .",
    "resulting bubble profile is determined using the bounce solution for the false vacuum decay which we will discuss below .",
    "first we note general features of the dynamics of a standard first order phase transition at finite temperature via bubble nucleation .",
    "a region of true vacuum , in the form of a spherical bubble , appears in the background of false vacuum .",
    "the creation of bubble leads to the change in the free energy of the system as ,    @xmath51    where r is the radius of bubble , @xmath52 is the surface energy contribution and @xmath53 is the volume energy contribution .",
    "@xmath54 is the difference of the free energy between the false vacuum and the true vacuum and @xmath55 is the surface tension which can be determined from the bounce solution .",
    "a bubble of size @xmath56 will expand or shrink depending on which process leads to lowering of the free energy given above .",
    "the bubbles of very small sizes will shrink to nothing since surface energy dominates . if the radius of bubble exceeds the critical size @xmath57 , it will expand and lead to the transformation of the metastable phase into the stable phase .",
    "eq.(5 ) is useful for the so - called _ thin wall _",
    "bubbles where there is a clear distinction between the surface contribution to the free energy and the volume contribution .",
    "for the temperature / time relevant for our case in relativistic heavy - ion collisions this will not be the case .",
    "instead we will be dealing with the _ thick wall _",
    "bubbles where surface and volume contributions do not have clear separations .",
    "we will determine the profiles of these thick wall bubbles numerically following the bounce technique @xcite .",
    "first we note that for the effective potential in eq.(4 ) , the barrier between true vacuum and false vacuum vanishes at temperatures above about 250 mev .",
    "so first order transition via bubble nucleation is possible only within the temperature range of @xmath58 mev - 250 mev . above @xmath59 250 mev",
    ", spinodal decomposition will take place due to the roll down of field .",
    "implementation of the dynamics of phase transition via spinodal decomposition is of completely different nature , and we hope to discuss this in a future work .    as we are discussing the initial confinement - deconfinement transition in the context of rhice ,",
    "clearly the discussion has to be within the context of longitudinal expansion only , with negligible effects of the transverse expansion .",
    "however , bjorken s longitudinal scaling model @xcite can not be applied during this pre - equilibrium phase , even with the assumption of quasi - equilibrium ( as discussed above ) , unless one includes a heat source which could account for the increase of effective temperature during this phase to the maximum equilibrium temperature @xmath60 . as indicated above",
    ", this heat source can be thought of as representing the rapid particle production ( with subsequent thermalization ) during this early phase .",
    "we will not attempt to model such a source here .",
    "instead , we will simply use the field equations resulting from bjorken s longitudinal scaling model for the evolution of the field configuration for the entire simulation , including the initial pre - equilibrium phase from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "the heating of the system until @xmath63 will be represented by the increase of the temperature upto @xmath64 .",
    "thus , during this period , the energy density and temperature evolution will not obey the bjorken scaling equations @xcite .",
    "after @xmath65 , with complete equilibrium of the system , the temperature will decrease according to the equations in the bjorken s longitudinal scaling model .",
    "we will take the longitudinal expansion to only represent the fact that whatever bubbles will be nucleated , they get stretched into ellipsoidal , and eventually cylindrical , shapes during the longitudinal expansion ( ignoring the boundary effects in the longitudinal direction ) .",
    "the transverse expansion of the bubble should then proceed according to relative pressure difference between the false vacuum and the true vacuum as in the usual theory of first order phase transition .",
    "we will neglect transverse expansion for the system , and focus on the mid rapidity region . with this picture in mind , we will work with effective 2 + 1 dimensional evolution of the field configuration , ( neglecting the transverse expansion of qgp ) .",
    "however , for determining the bubble profile and the nucleation probability of bubbles , one must consider full 3 + 1 dimensional case as bubbles are nucleated with full 3-dimensional profiles in the physical space .",
    "it will turn out that the bubbles will have sizes of about 1 - 1.5 fm radius . taking the initial collision region during the pre - equilibrium phase also to be of the order of 1 - 2 fm in the longitudinal direction , it looks plausible that the nucleation of 3-dimensional bubble profile as discussed above may provide a good approximation .",
    "of course the correct thing will be to consider the bounce solutions for rapidly longitudinally expanding plasma , and we hope to return to this issue in some future work .",
    "we neglect transverse expansion in the present work , which is a good approximation for the early stages when wall / string network forms",
    ". however , this will not be a valid approximation for later stages , especially when temperature drops below @xmath2 and wall / string network melts . the way to account for",
    "the transverse expansion in the context of our simulation will be to take a lattice with much larger physical size than the initial qgp system size , and allow free boundary conditions for the field evolution at the qgp system boundary ( which will still be deep inside the whole lattice ) .",
    "this will allow the freedom for the system to expand in the transverse direction automatically .",
    "with a suitable prescription of determining temperature from local energy density ( with appropriate account of field contributions and expected contribution from a plasma of quarks and gluons ) in a self consistent manner , the transverse expansion can be accounted for in this simulation .",
    "we hope to come back to this in a future work .",
    "let us consider the effective potential in eq.(4 ) , at a temperature such that there is a barrier between the true vacuum and the three z(3 ) vacua .",
    "an example of this situation is shown in fig.1 for the case with @xmath66 185 mev .",
    "the initial system ( of nucleons ) was at zero temperature with the order parameter l(x ) = 0 , and will be superheated as the temperature rises above the critical temperature .",
    "it can then tunnel through the barrier to the true vacuum , representing the deconfined qgp phase . at zero temperature",
    ", the tunneling probability can be calculated by finding the bounce solution which is a solution of the 4-dimensional euclidean equations of motion however , at finite temperature , this 4-dimensional theory will reduce to an effectively 3 euclidean dimensional theory if the temperature is sufficiently high , which we will take to be the case .    for this finite temperature case ,",
    "the tunneling probability per unit volume per unit time in the high temperature approximation is given by @xcite ( in natural units )    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the 3-dimensional euclidean action for the polyakov loop field configuration that satisfies the classical euclidean equations of motion .",
    "the condition for the high temperature approximation to be valid is that @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the radius of the critical bubble in 3 dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the values of temperature for our case ( relevant for bubble nucleation ) will be above @xmath71 mev .",
    "as we will see , the bubble radius will be larger than 1.5 fm ( @xmath34 ( 130 mev)@xmath72 ) which justifies our use of high temperature approximation to some extent .",
    "the determination of the pre - exponential factor is a non - trivial issue and we will discuss it below . the dominant contribution to",
    "the exponential term in @xmath73 comes from the least action @xmath74 symmetric configuration which is a solution of the following equation ( for the lagrangian in eq.(3 ) ) .",
    "@xmath75    where @xmath76 , subscript e denoting the coordinates in the euclidean space .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on @xmath77 are    @xmath78    bounce solution of eq.(7 ) can be analytically obtained in the _ thin wall _",
    "limit where the difference in the false vacuum and the true vacuum energy is much smaller than the barrier height .",
    "this situation will occur for very short time duration near @xmath79 for the effective potential in eq.(4 ) .",
    "however , as the temperature is rapidly evolving in the case of rhice , there will not be enough time for nucleating such large bubbles ( which also have very low nucleation rates due to having large action ) .",
    "thus the case relevant for us is that of thick wall bubbles whose profile has to be obtained by numerically solving eq.(7 ) .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , in the high temperature approximation the theory effectively becomes 3 ( euclidean ) dimensional .",
    "for a theory with one real scalar field in three euclidean dimensions the pre - exponential factor arising in the nucleation rate of critical bubbles has been estimated , see ref .",
    "the pre - exponential factor obtained from @xcite for our case becomes    @xmath80    it is important to note here that the results of @xcite were for a single real scalar field and one of the crucial ingredients used in @xcite for calculating the pre - exponential factor was the fact that for a bounce solution the only light modes contributing to the determinant of fluctuations were the deformations of the bubble perimeter . even though we are discussing the case of a complex scalar field @xmath1 , this assumption may still hold as we are calculating the tunneling from the false vacuum to one of the z(3 ) vacua ( which are taken to be degenerate here as we discussed above ) .",
    "this assumption may need to be revised when light modes e.g. goldstone bosons are present which then also have to be accounted for in the calculation of the determinant",
    ".    a somewhat different approach for the pre - exponential factor in eq.(6 ) is obtained from the nucleation rate of bubbles per unit volume for a liquid - gas phase transition as given in ref .",
    "@xcite ,    @xmath81    here @xmath82 is the dynamical prefactor which determines the exponential growth rate of critical droplets .",
    "@xmath83 is a statistical prefactor which measures the available phase space volume .",
    "the exponential term is the same as in eq.(6 ) with @xmath84 being the change in the free energy of the system due to the formation of critical droplet .",
    "this is the same as @xmath85 in eq.(6 ) .",

    ", one needs an estimate of the critical bubble size @xmath89 as well as bubble surface energy @xmath55 , ( along with other quantities like @xmath88 etc . as given by eqs.(11)-(14 ) ) .",
    "determination of @xmath89 is somewhat ambiguous here as the relevant bubbles are thick wall bubbles as seen in fig.(2 ) .",
    "here there is no clear demarcation between the core region and the surface region which could give an estimate of @xmath89 .",
    "essentially , there is no core at all and the whole bubble is characterized by the overlap of bubble wall region .",
    "we can take , as an estimate for the bubble radius @xmath89 any value from 1 fm - 1.5 fm .",
    "it is important to note here that this estimate of @xmath89 is only for the calculation of nucleation rate @xmath73 , and not for using the bubble profile for actual simulation .",
    "when bubbles are nucleated in the background of false vacuum with @xmath105 , a reasonably larger size of the bubble is used so that cutting off the profile at that radius does not lead to computational errors and field evolution remains smooth .",
    "once we have an estimate of @xmath89 , we can then estimate the surface tension @xmath55 ( which also is not unambiguous here ) as follows . with the realization that essentially there is no core region for the bubbles in fig(2 )",
    ", we say that the entire energy of the bubble ( i.e. the value of @xmath85 ) comes from the surface energy .",
    "then we write    @xmath106    for @xmath85 = 240 mev , we get @xmath107 mev/@xmath95 if we take @xmath89 = 1.5 fm . with @xmath89 = 1.0 fm ,",
    "we get @xmath55 = 20 mev/@xmath95 .    number of bubbles expected can now be calculated for the case when nucleation rate is given by eq.(10 ) .",
    "we find number of bubbles to be about 10@xmath108 with @xmath89 taken as 1.5 fm .",
    "this is in accordance with the results discussed in ref .",
    "the bubble number increases by about a factor 5 if @xmath89 is taken to be about 1 fm .",
    "thus , with the estimates based on eq.(10 ) , bubble nucleation is a rare event for the time available for rhice .",
    "as we have mentioned above , for us the bubble nucleation on one hand represents the possibility of actual dynamics of a first order transition , while on the other hand , it represents the generic properties of the domain structure arising from a c - d transition , which may very well be a cross - over , occurring in a finite time . with this view , and with various uncertainties in the determination of pre - exponential factors in the nucleation rate , we will consider a larger number of bubbles also and study domain wall and string production .",
    "first we will consider nucleation of 5 bubbles and then we will consider nucleation of 9 bubbles to get a better network of domain walls and strings .",
    "in our simulation critical bubbles are nucleated at a time when the temperature @xmath94 crosses the value @xmath101 mev during the initial stage between @xmath61 to @xmath109 fm ( during which we have modeled the system temperature to increase linearly from 0 to @xmath60 ) .",
    "we take @xmath110 mev so bubble nucleation stage is taken to be at @xmath111 fm when @xmath94 reaches the value 200 mev . again , this is an approximation since in realistic case bubbles will nucleate over a span of time given by the ( time dependent ) nucleation rate , which could lead to a spectrum of sizes of expanding bubbles at a given time .",
    "however , due to very short time available to complete the nucleation of qgp bubbles in the background of confined phase , bubbles will have very little time to expand during the nucleation period of all bubbles ( especially as initial bubble expansion velocity is zero ) .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume that all the bubbles nucleate at the same time .",
    "after nucleation , bubbles are evolved by the time dependent equations of motion in the minkowski space @xcite as appropriate for bjorken s longitudinal scaling model .",

    "we follow the approach described in @xcite to simulate the first order transition .",
    "we need to nucleate several bubbles randomly choosing the corresponding z(3 ) vacua for each bubble .",
    "this is done by randomly choosing the location of the center of each bubble with some specified probability per unit time per unit volume . before nucleating a bubble , it is checked if the relevant region is in the false vacuum ( i.e. it does not overlap with some other bubble already nucleated ) . in case there is an overlap , the nucleation of the new bubble is skipped . the orientation of @xmath77 inside each bubble is taken to randomly vary between the three z(3 ) vacua .",
    "for representing the situation of relativistic heavy ion collision experiments , the simulation of the phase transition is carried out by nucleating bubbles on a square lattice with physical size of 16 fm within a circular boundary ( roughly the gold nucleus size ) .",

    ", the thermalization is expected to happen within 1 fm time . as mentioned above , in this pre - equilibrium stage",
    ", we model the system as being in a quasi - equilibrium stage with a temperature which increases linearly with time ( for simplicity ) . the temperature of the system is taken to reach upto 400 mev in 1 fm time , starting from @xmath94 = 0 .",
    "after @xmath109 fm , the temperature decreases due to continued longitudinal expansion , i.e.    @xmath120    the stability of the simulation is checked by checking the variation of total energy of the system during the evolution .",
    "the energy fluctuation remains within few percent , with no net increase or decrease in the energy ( for fixed and periodic boundary conditions , and without the dissipative @xmath121 term in eq.(16 ) ) showing the stability of the simulation .",
    "the bubbles grow and eventually start coalescing , leading to a domain like structure .",
    "domain walls are formed between regions corresponding to different z(3 ) vacua , and strings form at junctions of z(3 ) domain walls .",
    "recall that the domain wall network is formed here in the transverse plane , appearing as curves .",
    "these are the cross - sections of the walls which are formed by elongation ( stretching ) of these curves in the longitudinal direction into sheets . at the intersection of these walls , strings form . in the transverse plane , these strings looks like vortices , which will be elongated into strings in the longitudinal direction .",
    "we now discuss the effects of quarks . as we mentioned above , we will follow the approach where the presence of quarks is interpreted as leading to explicit breaking of the z(3 ) symmetry , lifting the degeneracy of different z(3 ) vacua @xcite .",
    "this has important effects in the context of our model .",
    "first of all , different vacua having different energies implies different nucleation rates for the qgp bubbles with different z(3 ) vacua .",
    "further , for non - degenerate vacua , even planar @xmath0 interfaces do not remain static , and move away from the region with the unique true vacuum .",
    "thus , while for the degenerate vacua case every closed domain wall collapses , for the non - degenerate case this is not true any more . a closed wall enclosing",
    "the true vacuum may expand if it is large enough so that the surface energy contribution does not dominate ( this is essentially the same argument as given for the bubble expansion , see eq.(5 ) and the discussion following it ) .    to see the importance of these effects we need an estimate of the explicit symmetry breaking term arising from inclusion of quarks .",
    "for this we use the estimates given in @xcite . even though the estimates in ref.@xcite are given in the high temperature limit",
    ", we will use these for temperatures relevant for our case , i.e. @xmath122 mev , to get some idea of the effects of the explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "the difference in the potential energy between the true vacuum with @xmath123 and the other two vacua ( @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , which are degenerate with each other ) is estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be ,    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the number of massless quarks .",
    "if we take @xmath128 then @xmath129 . at the bubble nucleation temperature ( which we have taken to be about @xmath101 mev , the difference between the false vacuum and the true vacuum is about 150 mev/@xmath130 while @xmath131 at @xmath101 mev is about four times larger , equal to 600 mev/@xmath130 .",
    "as @xmath94 approaches @xmath2 , this difference will become larger as the metastable vacuum and the stable vacuum become degenerate at @xmath2 , while @xmath131 remains non - zero . for @xmath94 near 250 mev ( where the barrier between the metastable vacuum and the stable vacuum disappears )",
    ", @xmath131 becomes almost comparable to the difference between the potential energy of the false vacuum ( the confining vacuum ) and the true vacuum ( deconfined vacuum ) .",
    "it does not seem reasonable that at temperatures of order 200 mev a qgp phase ( with quarks ) has higher free energy than the hadronic phase .",
    "this situation can be avoided if the estimates of eq.(18 ) are lowered by about a factor of 5 so that these phases have lower free energy than the confining phase .",
    "( a more desirable situation will be when @xmath131 approaches zero as the confining vacuum and the deconfining ( true ) vacuum become degenerate at @xmath2 . )",
    "it is in the spirit of the expectation that explicit breaking of z(3 ) is small near @xmath2 for finite pion mass @xcite .",
    "even with such lower estimates , the effects of quarks may give different nucleation probabilities for different z(3 ) vacua .",
    "however , in this paper we will ignore this possibility .",
    "this may not be very unreasonable as for thick wall bubbles thermal fluctuations may be dominant in determining the small number of bubbles nucleated during the short span of time available .",
    "for very few bubbles nucleated , there may be a good fraction of events where different z(3 ) vacua may occur in good fraction .",
    "also note that the pre - exponential factor for the bubble nucleation rate of eq.(6 ) , as given in eq.(9 ) increases with the value of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , for the range of values of @xmath68 for which the exponential factor in eq.(6 ) is of order 1 , which is likely in our case , the nucleation rate may not decrease with larger values of @xmath68 , i.e. for the z(3 ) vacua with higher potential energies than the true vacuum .",
    "( of course for very large values of @xmath68 the exponential term will suppress the nucleation rate . )",
    "thus our assumption of neglecting quark effects for the bubble nucleation rate may not be unreasonable .",
    "we now consider the effect of non - zero @xmath131 , as in eq.(18 ) , on the evolution of closed domain walls . the temperature range relevant for our case",
    "is @xmath132 mev . in an earlier work",
    "we had numerically estimated the surface tension of z(3 ) walls to be about 0.34 and 7.0 gev/@xmath95 for @xmath94 = 200 and 400 mev respectively .",
    "the effects of quarks will be significant if a closed spherical wall ( with true vacuum inside ) starts expanding instead of collapsing .",
    "again , using the bubble free energy eq.(5 ) , with @xmath133 and @xmath55 as the surface energy of the interface , we see that the critical radius @xmath134 of the spherical wall is    @xmath135    for @xmath94 = 200 mev and 400 mev we get @xmath136 and 1.5 fm respectively . though these values are not large , these are not too small either when considering the fact that relevant sizes and times for rhice are of order few fm anyway .",
    "the values of @xmath134 we estimated here are very crude as for these sizes wall thickness is comparable to @xmath134 hence application of eq.(5 ) , separating volume and surface energy contributions , is not appropriate .",
    "further , as we discussed above , the estimate in eq.(18 ) which is applicable for high temperature limit , seems an over estimate by about an order of magnitude at these temperatures .",
    "thus uncertainties of factors of order 1 may not be unreasonable to expect . in that case",
    "the dynamics of closed domain walls of even several fm diameter will not be affected by the effects of quarks via eq.(18 ) .",
    "we will see in the next section of simulation results that the domain walls and strings typically have large velocities ( e.g. about 0.5 - 0.8 ) at the time of formation .",
    "these result from momentum of colliding bubble walls and from curvature in the shape of these walls ( as well as asymmetries in the profiles of strings ) at the time of formation . with such large velocities present , the effects of pressure differences between different z(3 ) vacua due to quarks may become subdominant in studying the evolution of these structures for the short time duration available for rhice .    with this",
    ", we will assume that for small closed walls , of order few fm diameter , as is expected in rhice , the quark effects in the evolution of wall network may be neglected .",
    "we plan to remove these assumptions and include the effects of non - zero @xmath131 due to quarks on bubble nucleation and wall evolution in a future work .",
    "as we mentioned above , the number of bubbles expected to form in rhice is small .",
    "we first present and discuss the case of 5 bubbles which is more realistic from the point of view of nucleation estimates given by eq.(6 ) ( though a gross over - estimate for eq.(10 ) ) .",
    "note that a domain wall will form even if only two bubbles nucleate ( with different z(3 ) vacua ) . however , to see qgp string formation , we need nucleation of at least three bubbles .",
    "next we will discuss the case of 9 bubbles which is a much more optimistic estimate of the nucleation rate ( even for eq.(6 ) ) .",
    "alternatively , this case can be taken as better representation of the case when the transition is a cross over and bubbles only represent a means for developing a domain structure expected after the cross - over is completed .",

    "this means that the energy density concentrated in any extended ( sheet like for domain walls and line like for strings / hot spots ) regions may not be able to defuse away effectively . assuming local energy density to directly result in multiplicity of particles coming from that region ,",
    "an analysis of particle distribution in @xmath3 and in rapidity should be able to reflect any such extended regions . in this context",
    ", it will be interesting to investigate if the ridge phenomenon seen at rhic @xcite could be a manifestation of an underlying z(3 ) domain wall / string structure .",
    "correlation of particle production over large range of rapidity will naturally result from longitudinally extended regions of high energy density ( _ hot spots _ in the transverse plane ) .",
    "combined with flow effects it may lead to ridge like structures @xcite . if extended domain wall structure survives in the transverse plane also , this will then extend to sheet like regions in the longitudinal direction .",
    "decay of such a region of high energy density may directly lead to a ridge like structure , without requiring flow effects .",
    "we expect non - trivial signatures resulting from the consideration of interactions of quarks and antiquarks with domain walls .",
    "it was shown in an earlier work @xcite using generic arguments that quarks and antiquarks should have non - zero reflection coefficients when traversing across these domain walls .",
    "a collapsing domain wall will then concentrate any excess baryon number enclosed , leading to formation of baryon rich regions .",
    "this is just like witten s scenario for the early universe @xcite ( which was applied for the case of rhice in ref .",
    "however , for these works it was crucial that the quark - hadron transition be of ( strong ) first order .",
    "as we have emphasized above , in our case formation of z(3 ) walls and strings will be a generic feature of any c - d phase transition .",
    "even though we have implemented it in the context of a first order transition via bubble nucleation , these objects will form even if the transition is a cross - over .",
    "thus , concentration of baryons in small regions should be expected to occur in rhice which should manifest in baryon concentration in small regions of rapidity and @xmath3 .",
    "another important aspect of quark / antiquark reflection is that inside a collapsing wall , each reflection increases the momentum of the enclosed particle .",
    "when closed domain walls collapse then enclosed quarks / antiquarks may undergo multiple reflections before finally getting out .",
    "this leads to a specific pattern of @xmath3 enhancement of quarks with heavy flavors showing more prominent effects @xcite .",
    "the modification of @xmath3 spectrum of resulting hadrons can be calculated , and the enhancement of heavy flavor hadrons at high @xmath3 can be analyzed for the signal for the formation of z(3 ) domain walls in these experiments @xcite . in our simulations",
    "extended domain walls also form which show bulk motion with velocities of order 0.5 .",
    "quarks / antiquarks reflected from such moving extended walls will lead to anisotropic momentum distribution of emitted particles which may also provide signature of such walls . for collapsing closed domain walls , spherical domain walls",
    "were used for estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "our simulation in the present work provides a more realistic distribution of shapes and sizes for the resulting domain wall network .",
    "we have estimated the velocity of moving domain walls to range from 0.5 to 0.8 for the situations studied .",
    "these velocities are large enough to have important effect on the momentum of quarks / antiquarks undergoing reflection from these walls .",
    "one needs to combine the analysis of @xcite with the present simulation to get a concrete signature for baryon concentration and heavy flavor hadron @xmath3 spectrum modification .",
    "we plan to carry this out in a future work .",
    "we also plan to study effects of spontaneous violation of cp due to formation of these z(3 ) walls in rhice .",
    "our results show interesting pattern of the evolution of the fluctuations in the energy density .",
    "as seen in fig.7 and fig.12 , energy density fluctuations show rapid changes during stages of bubble wall coalescence and during collapse / decay of domain walls .",
    "even string - antistring annihilations should be contributing to these fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations near the transition stage may leave direct imprints on particle distributions .",
    "it is intriguing to think whether dileptons or direct photons may be sensitive to these fluctuations , which could then give a time history of evolution of such energy density fluctuations during the early stages as well .",
    "even the presence of domain walls and strings during early stages may affect quark - antiquark distributions in those regions which may leave imprints on dileptons / direct photons . an important point",
    "to note is that in our model , we expect energy density fluctuations in event averages ( representing high energy density regions of domain walls / strings as discussed above ) , as well as event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "these will result due to fluctuation in the number / geometry of domain walls / strings from one event to the other resulting from different distribution of ( randomly occurring ) z(3 ) vacua in the qgp bubbles .",
    "even the number of qgp bubbles , governed by the nucleation probability , will vary from one event to the other contributing to these event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulation of formation of @xmath0 interfaces and associated strings at the initial confinement - deconfinement phase transition during the pre - equilibrium stage in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "a simple model of quasi - equilibrium system was assumed for this stage with an effective temperature which first rises ( with rapid particle production ) to a maximum temperature @xmath4 , and then decreases due to continued plasma expansion .    using the effective potential for the polyakov loop expectation value @xmath1 from ref .",
    "@xcite we study the dynamics of the ( c - d ) phase transition in the temperature / time range when the first order transition of this model proceeds via bubble nucleation . as we have emphasized above , though our study is in the context of a first order transition ,",
    "its results are expected to be valid even when the transition is a cross - over .",
    "( though for non - zero chemical potential the transition may indeed be of first order ) .",
    "the generic nature of our results arises due to the fact that the formation of z(3 ) domain walls and associated strings happens due to the a general domain structure resulting after any transition ( occurring in a finite time ) .",
    "this is the essential physics of the kibble mechanism underlying the formation of topological defects in symmetry breaking transitions .",
    "the @xmath0 wall network and associated strings formed during this early c - d transition are evolved using field equations in a plasma which is longitudinally expanding , with decreasing temperature .",
    "we have neglected here the transverse expansion which is a good approximation for the early stages near the formation stage of these objects , but may not be a good approximation for the later parts of simulations when temperature drops below @xmath2 and z(3 ) domain walls and strings melt away .",
    "we have studied size / shape of resulting closed domain wall as well as extended domain walls and have estimated the velocities of walls to range from 0.5 to 0.8 .",
    "we also calculate the energy density fluctuations expected due to formation of these objects .",
    "various experimental signals which can indicate the formation of these topologically non - trivial objects in rhice have been discussed .",
    "for example , existence of these objects will result in specific patterns of energy density fluctuations which may leave direct imprints on particle distributions . in our model",
    ", we expect energy density fluctuations in event averages ( representing high energy density regions of domain walls / strings ) , as well as event - by - event fluctuations as the number / geometry of domain walls / strings and even the number of qgp bubbles , varies from one event to the other .",
    "extended regions of large energy densities arising from z(3 ) walls and associated strings may be manifested in space - time reconstruction of hadron density ( using hydrodynamic model ) .",
    "the correlation of particle production over large range of rapidity will be expected from such extended regions .",
    "this , combined with the flow effects ( for string like regions ) , or possibly directly ( for sheet like extended region ) may provide an explanation for the ridge phenomena observed at rhic @xcite . also , from the reflection of quarks and antiquarks from collapsing domain walls , baryon number enhancement in localized regions ( due to concentration of net baryon number ) as well as enhancement of heavy flavor hadrons at high @xmath3 is expected .",
    "we emphasize again that the presence of @xmath0 walls and string may not only provide qualitatively new signatures for the qgp phase in these experiments , it may provide the first ( and may be the only possible ) laboratory study of such topological objects in a relativistic quantum field theory system .",
