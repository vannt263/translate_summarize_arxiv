    "more precisely , as already mentioned above , as a consequence of metric results of khintchine  @xcite and due to the fact that the discrepancy of @xmath86 can be expressed in terms of the continued fractions expansion of @xmath1 , we have @xmath87 for almost all @xmath1 . consequently , by theorem  [ th_thue2 ] , the typical asymptotic order of the discrepancy of parametric sequences @xmath75 is significantly larger than that of typical @xmath85-sequences , and by theorem  [ th_thue ] this is also true for exponential sums .",

    "as already mentioned earlier , it is rather difficult to give the right order for the exponential sums in theorem  [ th_thue ] , the trigonometric products in theorem  [ th_theorem2 ] , and the discrepancy of @xmath19 for concrete non - trivial examples of @xmath1 .",
    "what do we mean by a `` non - trivial '' example ?",
    "in the first part of section  [ sect_proof_th4 ] we will point out the following facts :    * the order of the discrepancy of the pure kronecker sequence @xmath88 never is significantly larger than the order of the discrepancy of the thue ",

    "two such examples are given in theorem  [ th_thue4 ] . especially in the first example the difference between @xmath89 and @xmath91 is of the maximal possible form .",

    ". for some information on the analysis of hybrid sequences see for example  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "+ as already mentioned , the proofs of theorems  [ th_thue ] and  [ th_thue2 ] are based on a connection between exponential sums of @xmath3 and the lacunary trigonometric products studied in theorem  [ th_theorem2 ] .",
    "we will establish this connection in the following lines , and exploit it in section  [ sect_lac ] in more detail . for the time being , we assume that @xmath52 is of the form @xmath107 for some positive integer @xmath61 . + to analyze the exponential sums appearing in theorem  [ th_thue ] and on the right - hand side of  , we define @xmath108 by the assumption that @xmath109 we have @xmath110 which yields @xmath111 and",
    "@xmath112    a similar analysis for the sequence @xmath11 shows that @xmath113 where again we assume that @xmath109 .",

    "thus the theory of lacunary sums allows us to obtain an estimate for the size of the exponential sums @xmath114 in the case when @xmath52 is a power of 2 ; however , it will turn out that we may also drop the condition that @xmath52 is an integral power of @xmath9 by applying a dyadic decomposition method .",
