    "the last decade has seen a renewed interest in perturbative quantum field theory ( pqft ) . on the one hand , progress has been achieved on amplitudes with many legs and a low number of loops ( zero or one ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( and the references therein ) . from an experimentalist point of view",
    "these results will be vital in the analysis of upcoming lhc - data .",
    "on the other hand the study of many loops with a low number of external legs is important for the understanding of high precision experiments like the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "huge theoretical efforts on the numerical @xcite , @xcite as well as on the analytical side @xcite , @xcite ( see below ) are accompanied by new insights from conjectured relations between pqft , number theory and knot theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hopf algebras @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and algebraic geometry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this article focuses on the second aspect of pqft .",
    "since the basic concepts are motivated by physical examples let us look at the magnetic moment of the electron which is a benchmark problem of perturbative quantum electrodynamics ( pqed ) .",
    "fifty years of computations provide us with 3 orders of radiative corrections to the ` classical ' value @xmath1 .",
    "the coefficient of the first order was derived in 1948 @xcite , the second order in 1957 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the third order was finished in 1996 @xcite .",
    "we give the result in a slightly unconventional way by introducing euler sums @xmath2 now , we can give the result for @xmath3 in terms of euler sums and rational numbers ( the coupling @xmath4 is measured to @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 this result stands out from other multi - loop calculations because it is very likely correct : the above number can actually be measured to a precision that controls the calculation .",
    "we see that the first order is given by a rational number , whereas the second order is provided by a sum of 4 terms : a rational number plus 3 transcendentals .",
    "( we do not distinguish between transcendentals and very - likely - transcendentals here . )",
    "we may consider the sum as an element in a 4-dimensional vector space over @xmath7 .",
    "this picture , however , may be premature : if we give the euler sums a grading ( a weight ) by adding the indices in a product ( rational numbers have weight 0 ) we see that the first two transcendentals are of weight 3 .",
    "maybe we should combine the two numbers to provide a sole transcendental ( written as @xmath8 ) resulting in a 3-dimensional vector space over @xmath7 for the second order .",
    "how can we tell ?",
    "we have to look at all other sorts of qed - experiments and check if we can write the second order in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the lamb shift e.g.  is of this type .",
    "the second order coefficient reads @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we see that we actually need ( a minimum of ) two transcendentals at two loops because the ratio between the weight 2 and the weight 3 transcendentals differs from eq .",
    "( [ 02 ] ) .",
    "it seems to be a general fact that transcendentals of different weight can not be combined . on the other hand ,",
    "the full photon propagator features a @xmath11 not paired by a @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , the photon propagator is gauge - dependent and hence not an observable quantity .    looking at the third order contribution in eq .",
    "( [ 02 ] ) we see transcendentals up to weight 5 .",
    "the grade grows in steps of 2 with every loop order .",
    "moreover , the third order coefficient features all lower order transcendentals and some of their products .",
    "( it can not contain @xmath13 because this has weight 6 , but @xmath14 is absent for some unknown reason . )",
    "both are generic features : the coefficients lie in a graded @xmath7-algebra and the grade grows in steps of 2 with the loop order",
    ". the new numbers at order 3 are one ( at least ) weight 5 transcendental @xmath15 , one weight 4 transcendental @xmath16 , and  in the case that a sole weight 3 transcendental suffices at second order  one weight 3 transcendental to account for the new ratio between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "in this paper we focus on perturbative massless @xmath0-theory which is technically less intricate than pqed but still shows the structure we are interested in .",
    "it is known ( up to 6 loops ) that the @xmath0 beta - function expands into a power series in the coupling @xmath17 with coefficients that are rational linear combinations of multiple zeta values ( mzvs ) .",
    "the transcendentals are periods in the sense of @xcite .",
    "such periods were found to be generic for pqfts @xcite . in @xcite the @xmath0-theory periods",
    "were reported up to loop order 7 ( all rational linear combinations of mzvs with 3 numbers missing ) . here , we want to extend this list to loop order 8 ( the ` census ' ) .",
    "another objective of the paper is to simplify the graph theoretical side of the problem by lifting it to primitive 4-regular ( vacuum ) graphs .",
    "this lift uses a well - known ` conformal ' symmetry of primitive graphs in massless renormalizable qfts @xcite .",
    "primitive vacuum graphs are relatively sparse at low loop order ( e.g.  2 at 5 loops or 14 at 7 loops ) , however they become quite abundant at higher loops ( 7  635  677 at 14 loops , see table 1 , sect .  [ sect3 ] ) .    as a side effect of the approach we recognize that primitive vacuum graphs with vertex connectivity 3 evaluate to products of lower order periods ( thm .",
    "[ thm1 ] ) . graphically the product is described as gluing along triangles ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . among the 73 primitive vacuum graphs up",
    "to loop order 8 we have 13 products .    in the following we concentrate on irreducible ( non - product , vertex connectivity @xmath18 ) primitive graphs and implement another two reductions : the new twist identity which is quite ubiquitous at high loop order ( thm .",
    "[ thm2 ] ) and the well known but rather sparse fourier identity @xcite , @xcite ( thm .",
    "[ thm3 ] ) which is slightly extended in remark [ rem2 ] . both identities",
    "together reduce the number of irreducible periods up to loop order 8 from 60 to 48 .",
    "we use ` exact numerical methods ' @xcite in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] to identify 31 of the remaining 48 irreducible periods .",
    "all of these periods are found to be _ integer _ linear combinations of mzvs ( as suggested for some periods in @xcite ) .",
    "the missing 17 periods ( 2 at loop order 7 and 15 at loop order 8) are inaccessible by the method available today .    from a physical point of view one may doubt the value of these considerations because the periods considered here are not directly linked to observables .",
    "they are rather a kind of qft - concentrate originating from the most complicated feynman graphs of a given order .",
    "they hence may serve as a test for calculational techniques . if one is able to calculate all periods of a certain order one has a good method to calculate all amplitudes in this order .",
    "regretfully the today s analytical methods last only for the first few loop orders ( five , maybe six , in massless @xmath0-theory ) .    from a mathematical point of view",
    "the appearance of mzv periods hints towards ( algebraic ) geometries of mixed tate type @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "every period in @xmath0-theory that is a rational linear combinations of mzvs reveals a connection between quantum field theory and mixed tate motives .",
    "however , it can not be conjectured ( by what we know today ) that the entire @xmath0-theory ( all periods to all orders ) stays in the realm of mzvs @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is unclear if @xmath0-periods ( in the sense of this article ) exhaust the number contents of @xmath0-theory ( as suggested by the spirit of the hopf - algebra approach to renormalization @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although much of the material spawned from a conjectured connection to knot theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite this link stayed somewhat vague such that the author decided not to include it into this paper .",
    "however , it may well be possible that this connection will reappear as the knowledge on qft - periods develops",

    "the @xmath30 ` propagators ' @xmath31 ( associated to ` interior ' edges ) are inverted rank 4 quadrics in the coordinates of momentum vectors .",
    "each quadric is the square @xmath32 of a 4-dimensional euclidean vector which is a ( signed ) sum of ( some of ) the external momenta @xmath33 and internal momenta @xmath34 .",
    "the first half of the right hand side ( up to the @xmath35 ) is the amplitude of the tree graph ( with 4 edges ) whereas the second half ( for @xmath36 ) is a divergent integral : graphs that contribute to the @xmath0 4-point function have @xmath37 .",

    "the domain of integration is orientable and compact without boundary and thus a cycle in @xmath49 .",
