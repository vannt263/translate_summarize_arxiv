    "it is well - known that elementary particles interact by four fundamental interactions : gravitation , electromagnetism , the weak interaction and the strong interaction .",
    "the framework of quantum field theory has been extremely successful in describing many aspects of the last three interactions within remarkable experimental precision .",
    "there are however numerous aspects which remain poorly understood .",
    "one such long - standing puzzle comes from the strong interaction .",
    "conventional quantum field theory methods are mainly based on ( but not limited to ) perturbative techniques and are therefore generally inadequate to address various aspects of strong coupling dynamics .",
    "the quantum field theory describing the strong interaction is called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the elementary degrees of freedom of qcd are massive spin-@xmath1 particles called  quarks \" and massless spin-@xmath2 particles called  gluons \" .",
    "there are several different quarks ( named  up \" ,  down \" ,  charm \" ,  strange \" ,  top \" and  bottom \" ) .",
    "however depending on their masses the quarks can be broadly divided into two categories : the light quarks ( including the up , down and the strange ) and the heavy quarks ( including the charm , bottom and the top ) . as a first approximation we can set the masses of the light quarks to zero and the masses of the heavy quarks to infinity . in this approximation",
    "the only parameter in qcd is the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "this coupling constant is a function of the energy scale , which is encoded in the qcd beta function .",
    "the qcd beta function was calculated a long time ago in refs . @xcite and it was shown that it is an asymptotically free theory .",
    "this means that the coupling constant becomes small as the energy scale increases ( in the uv ) and becomes large when the energy scale becomes small ( in the ir ) .",
    "this notion of uv or ir energy scale in qcd is decided in terms of the only relevant scale @xmath3 generated by dimensional transmutation .",
    "physically , @xmath3 ( around @xmath4 million electron volt ( mev ) ) corresponds to the energy scale where the qcd coupling constant becomes of order one , hence the theory becomes non - perturbative .",
    "thus perturbative field theory methods based on expansion in the small coupling constant are applicable only in the energy regime much larger than @xmath3 .",
    "indeed a lot of efforts have been made to address aspects of qcd within such perturbative regime , _",
    "e.g. _ in ref .",
    "@xcite aspects of dense quark matter have been addressed in a perturbative framework , refs .",
    "@xcite have perturbatively computed thermodynamic pressure of hot qcd .",
    "there is a vast literature on similar aspects .",
    "although such perturbative approach has led us to remarkable insights about phases of qcd , this is only a small part of what we would want to understand .",
    "it is of vital theoretical interest to build up useful and efficient non - perturbative techniques to address strong coupling dynamics in general .",
    "qcd is one such strongly coupled theory which posses ( at least ) two remarkable features in the low energy regime : confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "both these effects have been observed in experiments , however their dynamical origin is not well - understood . in a confining theory ,",
    "the elementary degrees of freedom exist only in the form of bound states . in qcd",
    ", we can only observe the quark bound states such as mesons or baryons ( collectively known as the hadrons ) in the low energy regime , but not free quarks .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking , on the other hand , occurs _ via _ the formation of a condensate consisting of fermions of opposite chiralities .",
    "the understanding of both these features remains an open problem till today .",
    "there exist powerful non - perturbative techniques .",
    "lattice qcd is one such example . in this framework ,",
    "spacetime is represented by discrete lattice points and quantum fields are represented by degrees of freedom living on each lattice site .",
    "such a discrete formulation of spacetime provides a natural cut - off for the energy scale given by the inverse lattice spacing . the qcd path integral , and therefore any observable , can in principle be computed by numerical simulations on a computer .",
    "although lattice qcd is a very useful computational tool , it may not shed any light on the conceptual understanding .",
    "moreover , the lattice computations have technical limitations of their own .",
    "specifically , this framework is not ( yet ) equipped well - enough to address non - equilibrium time dependent dynamics .",
    "these computations are also limited to vanishing chemical potential due to the so called  sign problem \" .",
    "however various methods have been developed over the past decade to circumvent the sign problem ; we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "moreover , lattice qcd remains a very useful tool in studying thermal properties of qcd at vanishing chemical potential ; for a recent review see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "some pedagogical introduction on lattice qcd can be found in _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effort towards understanding the strong coupling dynamics of qcd is not purely theoretically motivated . in recent years",
    ", the relativistic heavy ion collision ( rhic ) experiments at brookhaven national laboratory have probed the strong coupling regime of qcd and thus pose a challenge for a theoretical understanding of the data .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced at rhic is at the energy scale roughly same as the @xmath3 , thus it is expected that the dynamics is presumably strongly coupled .",
    "this intuition has further been supported by the fact that rhic data is best described or fitted in the framework of ideal fluid dynamics@xcite .",
    "fluid dynamics can be viewed as an effective description of a system when the mean free path of the constituent microscopic degrees of freedom is much smaller than any characteristic length scale of the system .",
    "thus , by definition it implies the presence of strong coupling in the microscopic description of the corresponding system .",
    "for the case of rhic , some direct evidences of strong coupling further exist and can be measured in _",
    "e.g. _ , the large elliptic flow , jet quenching _ etc .",
    "_ for a pedagogical introduction of heavy ion physics and discussions on related phenomena see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "the tools of lattice qcd are not very helpful to understand the rhic results since many of the observed phenomena are time dependent non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "surprisingly string theory provides an unique toolkit to study strongly coupled aspects of qcd , at least in some qualitative sense .",
    "this is rooted on the idea of holography or gauge - gravity duality . at present , the holographic principle is a conjecture .",
    "the progress in understanding of black hole entropy and its dependence on its area rather than its volume led to the key idea@xcite .",
    "the precise statement of holography is as follows : any theory of quantum gravity in a given background is entirely equivalent to a non - gravitational theory describing the degrees of freedom living at the boundary of the spacetime and _ vice versa_. this is also referred as the gauge - gravity duality .",
    "furthermore in the known examples of this duality the non - gravitational theory turns out to be a certain class of conventional quantum field theories .",
    "string theory provides us with a natural and well - defined framework where most of such examples of gauge - gravity duality can be understood and used .",
    "however , much of the effective and working knowledge of the gauge - gravity duality can be learnt with minimal involvement of string theory .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review from this point of view",
    ". we will take a more conventional route and briefly review how this duality emerges in string theory .    in ref .",
    "@xcite t hooft made the crucial step in recognizing the rank of the non - abelian gauge group as an expansion parameter for the non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "namely , he proposed to consider an @xmath5 yang - mills theory in the limit @xmath6 keeping the t hooft coupling @xmath7 constant .",
    "in this so called large @xmath0 limit many simplifications happen .",
    "it can be shown that the partition function of the large @xmath0 yang - mills theory is dominated by the planar diagrams only and the next corrections occur at the order of @xmath8 .",
    "viewed as an approximation scheme for qcd ( where @xmath9 ) , this gives a result correct up to about @xmath10 error margin and thus not completely irrelevant .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath11 expansion of the yang - mills partition function takes an identical form of the genus expansion of the string partition function , thus suggesting a possible connection between string theory and large @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "it was realized that string theory naturally contains various extended objects called  branes \" .",
    "a certain kind of such  branes \" called the d - branes was originally realized in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however now it is well - known that there are several kinds of branes in string theory .",
    "we refer to the book in ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive discussion on the properties of various kinds of branes . here",
    "we will focus entirely on the d - branes .",
    "these extended objects are the places where an open string can end .",
    "such an extended object with @xmath12 spatial dimensions is called a d@xmath12-brane .",
    "it was further realized that these d@xmath12-branes arise as solutions of supergravity which is obtained as the low energy limit of string theory .",
    "now the crucial step was to realize that the low energy dynamics of @xmath0 coincident d@xmath12-branes can be equivalently described by the gravitational background of the d@xmath12-brane and an @xmath5 yang - mills theory in @xmath13-dimensions living at the boundary of the d@xmath12-brane background .",
    "string theory provides a large class of such examples .",
    "the existence of d@xmath12-branes in both type iia and type iib supergravity ( obtained as the low energy limits of type iia and type iib string theory respectively ) provides a rich arena to explore and realize numerous examples of gauge - gravity duality .",
    "the most popular example of this is the duality between @xmath14 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory in @xmath15-dimensions and the gravitational background of anti de - sitter ( ads ) space in @xmath16-dimensions .",
    "however none of the gauge theories mentioned above resemble qcd in precise details .",
    "it is still an open problem to construct the precise gravitational dual to qcd .",
    "the idea of using , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath17 sym to understand features of qcd is therefore completely based on the concept of universality .",
    "this idea was initially explored in refs .",
    "@xcite to learn about the phase diagram of qcd using the dual gravitational background .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for discussions on related physics . for an early review exploring this idea",
    "we refer to the chapters 18 and 19 of ref .",
    "a more recent and less technical review can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the notion of universality class is quite old in statistical mechanical systems .",
    "phase transitions in physical systems are described by critical exponents which capture the behavior of physical quantities near the phase transition .",
    "various physical systems have been observed to have the same critical exponents based on which many macroscopic systems can be grouped into one set of universality class .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of the physics of phase transitions and the notion of universality class .",
    "however , here we will consider a much relaxed notion of universality .",
    "we will merely concentrate on any statement ( qualitative or quantitative ) that holds universally for such large @xmath0 gauge theories .    that such universal statements exist",
    "is further supported by the following observation . at zero temperature ,",
    "the physics of qcd differs considerably from the physics of @xmath17 sym ( or any such large @xmath0 gauge theory for which we know the gravitational dual ) .",
    "firstly , the degrees of freedom do not match .",
    "moreover qcd is confining , with a discrete spectrum and running coupling constant whereas @xmath17 sym does not share any of these features .",
    "however at finite temperature both these descriptions consist of deconfined strongly coupled plasma of gluons and various matter fields .",
    "furthermore as it has been emphasized before , the best model describing the dynamics of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at rhic is fluid dynamics which is an effective long - wavelength description and does not necessarily rely on the microscopic details .",
    "interestingly rhic provides us with a remarkable quantitative evidence of such possible universality .",
    "recent investigations , _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite seem to suggest that the ratio of viscosity to entropy density for the qgp plasma @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the planck constant and @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "although presently we do not have any qcd calculation for this ratio , using ads / cft refs .",
    "@xcite calculated the ratio to be @xmath21 .",
    "it was further argued in refs .  @xcite that the ratio @xmath21 is universal for any gauge theory with a classical gravity dual .",
    "this remarkable qualitative and quantitative ( in terms of orders of magnitude ) resemblance to the observed data at rhic is suggestive of an universality we alluded to .",
    "let us briefly comment on a further interesting observation .",
    "generically , the finite temperature strong coupling physics seems to have universal properties which can be obtained using the methods of gauge - gravity duality and ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "thus a natural question arises : whether there is a connection between the dual gravitational and the fluid dynamic descriptions . during the past few years",
    "this possible connection has been analyzed in detail and it has been concluded that there is a precise map between a class of inhomogeneous , dynamical black hole solutions in asymptotically ads spacetime and arbitrary fluid flows in the strongly coupled field theory living at the boundary .",
    "this is now known as the fluid - gravity correspondence@xcite .",
    "we refer to the ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review and further references on this topic .",
    "thus we can boldly step forward in using techniques of gauge - gravity duality to further understand the strong coupling dynamics of qcd in some universal sense .",
    "however we will not attempt to compare any of our results with any experimental data , at most we will merely comment or compare with the results and expectations from qcd whereever necessary .",
    "our approach should thus be viewed as an attempt to use the tool of the ads / cft correspondence ( or gauge - gravity duality ) to learn about strong coupling dynamics of large @xmath0 non - abelian gauge theories in as much generality as possible .",
    "string theory is a vast subject and we will just refer the standard pedagogical textbooks  @xcite for interested readers . here",
    "we will briefly review some basic facts about string theory .",
    "the basic degrees of freedom of string theory are one dimensional objects called strings .",
    "the fundamental parameter of the theory is the characteristic length scale @xmath22 , which sets the string tension @xmath23 .",
    "the interaction strength between the strings is given by the dimensionless string coupling constant denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "strings can be both open and closed .",
    "open strings are one - dimensional line segments with a boundary and two end points . on the other hand ,",
    "closed strings are loops with no boundary or end points .    based on the presence of supersymmetry in the underlying action",
    ", string theory can be divided into two broad categories : the bosonic string theory and the superstring theory .",
    "there are various kinds of superstring theories , which go under the technical names of type i , type iia , type iib and heterotic string theories _ etc_.",
    "these apparently different theories are actually related by certain duality transformations and are connected to what is known as m - theory .",
    "although presently we lack a complete understanding of string theory ( or m - theory ) , the low energy limit of this theory is rather well - studied . in the low energy limit",
    ", string theory / m - theory reduces to ten / eleven dimensional supergravity .",
    "it is in the framework of supergravity where many aspects of the gauge - gravity duality have been discovered and used .",
    "note however that many aspects ( _ e.g. _ later when we consider branes and fundamental strings with gauge fields on them ) of the duality depends on the full string theory and not just its low energy limit .",
    "nonetheless , all our computations in the later chapters are performed within the supergravity approximation . in this thesis",
    "we will discuss two different ( the type iib and the type iia ) supergravity frameworks in particular .      in type iib theory ,",
    "we can have d@xmath2 , d@xmath25 , d@xmath16 and d@xmath26 ( stable ) branes . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the low energy limit of d3-branes only .    to lead to the conjecture ,",
    "let us start with a stack of @xmath0 parallel d3-branes .",
    "in this set - up there are two kinds of excitations : the open strings that start and end on the d3-branes and the closed strings that propagate through the ten dimensional bulk . at low energies ( _ i.e. _ energies much smaller than @xmath27 )",
    ", we can integrate out the massive modes to obtain an effective action given by @xmath28 .",
    "the bulk action @xmath29 is the action for type iib supergravity up to corrections in @xmath30 ( which appear as higher curvature corrections to the type iib supergravity action ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the massless spectrum of open strings starting and ending on the d3-branes constitute the vector supermultiplet of @xmath17 sym in @xmath15-dimensions with @xmath31 gauge group .",
    "the presence of the gauge group can be understood as follows .",
    "the massless open string spectrum ending on a stack of @xmath0 parallel d3-branes is labeled by an index known as the chan - paton factor . in case of oriented strings",
    ", it can be shown that these indices transform in the adjoint representation of an @xmath31 gauge group .",
    "this gives the brane action @xmath32 .",
    "there are also interactions between the bulk modes and the brane modes which is denoted by @xmath33 . in the limit @xmath34",
    ", these interactions are suppressed reflecting that gravity becomes free at large distance scales .",
    "thus in the low energy limit , we get a complete decoupling between the open and the closed string modes .",
    "let us now discuss this decoupling in some details .",

    "following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite this background is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the flat lorentz metric ; @xmath39 is the radial coordinate and @xmath40 is a function harmonic in the six directions transverse to the d3-branes .",
    "@xmath41 is the four - form rr potential sourced by the d3-brane and @xmath0 is an integer measuring the flux quanta of the rr field strength .",
    "this supergravity background has a horizon at @xmath42 and the boundary is located at @xmath43 . from the point of view of a boundary observer",
    ", the low energy type iib string modes near the horizon will be infinitely redshifted by the factor @xmath44 and thus these low energy excitations near the horizon should describe the low energy massless degrees of freedom seen by the asymptotic observer .",
    "on the other hand , the low energy massless excitations of type iib string theory is described by the type iib supergravity as seen by the boundary observer .    now any bulk excitation in the full background interacts with the near - horizon excitations , which is captured by the absorption cross - section of graviton scattered by the near - horizon regime , @xmath45 as obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath46 denotes the energy of the graviton .",
    "however , in the low energy limit ( denoted by @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 since the bulk excitations have a wavelength much larger than the gravitational size of the brane .",
    "thus it is appropriate to conclude that bulk excitations decouple from the near - horizon excitations in the low energy limit .",
    "now we will precisely define what we mean by the  near - horizon \" limit of the background in ( [ eqt : d3full ] ) .",
    "we achieve the near - horizon limit of ( [ eqt : d3full ] ) by sending @xmath49 and keeping @xmath50 fixed . in leading order in @xmath51",
    "we get the following background@xcite @xmath52 the metric in ( [ eqt : d3ads ] ) is the metric of ads@xmath53 background . thus we learn that the near - horizon geometry of d3-branes is identical to an anti - de sitter space",
    ".    therefore we arrive at two physical descriptions for the low energy physics of a stack of @xmath0 d3-branes : the @xmath17 sym theory and the type iib string theory in ads@xmath53 background .",
    "the essence of maldacena s ads / cft correspondence is to conjecture that these two descriptions are entirely equivalent .",
    "let us now formally state the correspondence .",
    "_ type iib string theory on ads@xmath53 background is equivalent to @xmath17 sym theory in @xmath15-dimensions . _",
    "one hint in favor of this correspondence comes from the non - trivial matching of the global symmetry group in the gauge theory with the isometry group of the geometry .",
    "let us therefore discuss this in some more details .",
    "we will not explicitly prove or demonstrate any of the following assertions , for our purposes it would suffice to just review them .",
    "@xmath54 sym is a maximally supersymmetric gauge theory with @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "the degrees of freedom are contained in the gauge multiplet of this theory which consists of gauge fields , four left - handed weyl fermions and six real scalar fields .",
    "all these fields transform in the adjoint representation of the @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "this theory has only one gauge coupling constant usually denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "a remarkable feature of this theory is the exact conformal invariance implying that the coupling constant @xmath55 does not run at all .",
    "the global symmetry group of this theory is the conformal group in @xmath15-dimensions , which is given by @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath54 sym also has sixteen real supercharges which can be rotated into each other by an @xmath57 group called the r - symmetry group .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath61 .",
    "now we focus on the geometric side .",
    "anti - de sitter spaces are defined as spaces with constant negative curvature .",
    "these spaces are obtained as a solution to einstein s equations with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the @xmath62-dimensional anti - de sitter space can be represented as the following hyperboloid in @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radius of curvature of the hyperboloid .",
    "it is evident from this description that ads@xmath66 space has @xmath56 isometry acting as the rotation group in @xmath67-dimensions .",
    "a simple way to parametrize the solution of eqn . ( [ eqt : adshyper ] ) is to set @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "however , it is not known how to quantize string theory on the curved ads@xmath66 background .",
    "thus the strong form of the conjecture is hard to confirm .",
    "a weaker form of the conjecture can be based on the t hooft limit with a fixed t hooft coupling defined by @xmath7 , while taking the limit @xmath74 . in this large @xmath0 expansion",

    "the origin of this phase transition , as we shall see , is as follows : the generic behavior of an allowed solution for @xmath231 as in equation  ( [ eqt : l ] ) , is not enough to determine whether the behavior corresponds to an @xmath240vanishing d7brane or an @xmath242vanishing d7brane .",

    "we will name these minkowski embeddings .",
    "it is this change in topology ( @xmath242 versus @xmath240 shrinking ) between the different solutions that will correspond to a phase transition .",
    "the classical equation of motion for @xmath264 is : @xmath265 when @xmath88 goes to infinity and the background metric becomes asymptotically ads@xmath266 , the equation of motion reduces to : @xmath267 which has solution : @xmath268 these two terms are exactly the non  normalizable and normalizable terms corresponding to a dimension 3 operator ( @xmath269 ) in the dual field theory with source @xmath155 and vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath241 .",
    "next we solve equation  ( [ eqt : eqt of motion ] ) numerically using a shooting technique .",
    "shooting from infinity towards the horizon , physical solutions are those that have a finite value at the horizon .",
    "this will only be accomplished for a particular @xmath155 and @xmath241 value from equation ( [ eqt : l ] ) which would have to be delicately chosen by hand .",
    "therefore , if we instead start from the horizon with a finite solution , it will shoot towards the physical asymptotic solutions we desire . in order to be able to analyze the phase transition between the black hole and minkowski solutions , we shoot from the horizon for the condensate solutions and from @xmath270 for the minkowski solutions .",
    "this technique avoids having to correctly choose the boundary conditions at infinity , which is a sensitive procedure , allowing us to have many more data points to analyze the phase transition .",
    "we impose the boundary condition that , at our starting point ",

    ", we will present the profile of the probe branes in @xmath273-plane .",
    "therefore we define the following dimensionless quantities @xmath274 in this coordinate system several d7brane embedding solutions are shown in figure  [ fig : solutionsinlandrho ] .",

    "we plot the @xmath241 values as a function of @xmath155 in figure  [ fig : c vs m ] . when enlarged , as shown in figure  [ fig : c vs m zoom ] , we find , as anticipated in the introductory remarks , the multi  valuedness in @xmath241 for a given @xmath155 . physics will choose just one answer for @xmath241 .",
    "there is therefore the possibility of a transition from one branch to another as one changes @xmath155 .    in order to determine exactly where the transition takes place",
    ", we have to calculate the free energy of the d7brane . in the semi - classical limit that we are considering ,",
    "the free energy is given by the on  shell action times @xmath275 .",
    "for our case , this is simply given by @xcite : @xmath276 where here @xmath237 .",
    "alternatively we can determine the phase transition point by considering an equivalent maxwell construction .",
    "since @xmath241 and @xmath155 are thermodynamically conjugate to each other , the free energy difference can be expressed as @xmath277 .",
    "therefore the phase transition will happen exactly at the point where the areas under the curve separated by the vertical dashed line in figure  [ fig : c vs m zoom ] are equal .",
    "thus we find a first order phase transition at @xmath278 where the condensate s vev jumps discontinuously , which is shown with the dashed black line in figure  [ fig : c vs m zoom ] .",

    "@xcite , where the authors developed an appropriate formalism to study the meson spectrum of the theory before and after the phase transition .",
    "they were able to show that after the phase transition there are no bound meson states , but only quasi - normal excitations corresponding to a melting mesons .",
    "this is why the present understanding of the observed first order phase transition is that it corresponds to the confinement / deconfinement phase transition of the fundamental matter which in the case of consideration is the meson melting phase transition .",
    "we will investigate the effect of an external constant magnetic field in the dynamics of probe flavours in the thermal @xmath17 yang - mills theory .",
    "the material presented here is based on the work done in collaboration with tameem albash , veselin filev and clifford johnson@xcite .",

    "@xcite analyzed the dynamics of probe flavours in a background constant magnetic field at zero temperature , which is the premise of the finite temperature physics we will discuss in this chapter .",

    "it is fairly evident from the form of ( [ eqt : bfield ] ) that this anti - symmetric field should be identified with an external constant magnetic field ( the strength of which is denoted by @xmath282 ) .    on the gauge theory perspective",

    "the solutions split into two classes : the first class are solutions corresponding to embeddings that wrap a shrinking @xmath240 in the @xmath71 part of the geometry and ( when the @xmath240 vanishes ) closes at some finite radial distance @xmath39 above the black hole s horizon which is located at @xmath301 .",

    "the results for the relative free energies of those solution ( compared to the other solutions at the same values of the mass ) would be the same , and so the complete story would be unaffected .",
    "a more drastic possibility is simply that the physics is considerably modified by instabilities associated with those conical solutions that our current study has not revealed  the appropriate part of the meson spectrum is particularly difficult to study numerically here , and so the tell  tale signs of tachyonic modes that represent an instability are hard to check for in this case .",

    "the straight branes correspond to the melted phase where quarks are free whereas the curved branes correspond to the mesonic phase where quarks exists in the form of bound states or chiral condensates .",

    "this implies that the asymptotic global symmetry group @xmath103 breaks down to a @xmath422 , which is very similar to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . in the limit @xmath110 , the confining phase disappears",
    "furthermore , the background topology in the @xmath411-submanifold is not cigar - shaped anymore .",
    "therefore the flavour brane ",
    "anti - brane pair can either join together or end separately in the bulk .",
    "however it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that it is energetically favourable for the probe brane  anti - brane pair to join together . thus in this model , in the low temperature regime chiral symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the type iib model .",
    "it was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the type iib set - up an external magnetic field breaks all supersymmetry and therefore can induce spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore this external magnetic field provides a natural scale for this system at zero temperature given by @xmath696 , where @xmath65 is the radius of the ads - space and @xmath282 is the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "thus conformal invariance is completely lost even at zero temperature .",
    "a naive dimensional analysis can be used to fix the behaviour of the chiral condensate @xmath697 , which we have discussed in the @xmath338 limit in chapter 3 .",
    "the background temperature is another important physical scale . in the absence of any external magnetic field",
    "we discussed the temperature driven meson - melting transition and associated meson spectrum in chapter 3 .",
    "this transition can simply be described as follows . below a certain critical temperature quarks",
    "exist in bound states such as mesons . above this critical temperature ,",
    "these bound states melt and form a plasma of the constituents . in chapter  3",
    "we also investigated the case when both temperature and magnetic field are present .",
    "the phase structure is now controlled by two physical scales : the temperature and the chiral symmetry breaking scale induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "we have found that these two physical scales have competing interplay and discussed the relevant phase structure in detail in chapter  3 .",
    "the main feature that emerged from this study is the so called effect of  magnetic catalysis \" of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "for a given temperature sufficiently high magnetic field induces chiral symmetry breaking by promoting the stability of quark bound states such as mesons or the chiral condensate .",
    "this means that for a given temperature we can increase the strength of the magnetic field so that the meson melting transition disappears altogether .",
    "in this model , this effect exists for arbitrarily large temperature .    in the type iia model ,",
    "the low temperature phase breaks chiral symmetry spontaneously . therefore introducing a magnetic field",
    "is expected to further enhance this effect .",
    "this is what we observed in chapter 4 .",
    "however , the finite temperature physics is much richer in content .",
    "sufficiently high temperature can trigger the restoration of chiral symmetry , which is similar to the meson - melting transition in the type iib set - up .",
    "interestingly we found that an external magnetic field and temperature again appear as two competing parameters resulting in a non - trivial phase diagram .",
    "an external magnetic field promotes the breaking of chiral symmetry and avoids the melting transition .",
    "however , in this model there seems to exist an upper bound of the chiral symmetry restoring temperature for arbitrarily large magnetic field .",
    "the existence of this upper bound in temperature is also in sharp contrast with what we observed in the type iib set - up .    on a related note , in chapter 6",
    "we have discussed the effect of the magnetic field on associated spectrum of mesons with both small and large spins .",
    "we have observed that the magnetic field increases the lifetime of the melting meson and enhances the angular momentum of mesons with large spin .",
    "both these effects favour the bound states over the free constituent fundamental matter .",
    "there is an interesting point to note . as we have discussed , both these gravity duals are formally quite different .",
    "even the breaking of the symmetry group that we have studied under the name of chiral symmetry is rather different .",
    "however , the qualitative feature of the  magnetic catalysis \" seems to be a robust one in both these models .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that this  magnetic catalysis \" in chiral symmetry breaking is indeed an universal phenomenon .",
    "similar conclusion has been arrived previously by studying several field theory models in various non - perturbative frameworks ( _ e.g. _ using the dyson ",
    "schwinger equation ) in _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "it is perhaps not impossible to imagine probing some of these properties of the real quark - gluon plasma within an experimental set - up with an external magnetic field .    emboldened by the interesting physics observed in the presence of an external magnetic field , it is natural to consider the effect of an external electric field .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of a constant electric field ( in the type iib model ) in chapter 4 and briefly towards the end of chapter 5 ( in the type iia model ) .",
    "intuitively , an electric field tries to dissociate any quark bound state into its constituents and drives a current .",
    "this is what we observed in chapter 4 .",
    "the probe brane analysis in both these models seems to have an interesting feature .",
    "it is the existence of a vanishing locus or the so called pseudo - horizon ( above the actual horizon ) at which the probe brane action vanishes . in order for the probe brane to extend beyond this point , an additional gauge field",
    "is excited on the worldvolume .",
    "this additional gauge field gives the expectation value of the current that is caused by the electric field .",
    "we have computed the conductivity in both the type iib and the type iia models .",
    "however , much work is still needed to understand the curious features in presence of an electric field . in chapter 4",
    ", we found that depending on the value of the polar angle of entering the vanishing locus the probe brane develops a conical singularity .",
    "similar conical singularity was observed in the type iia model in ref .",
    "we have conjectured that stringy corrections may possibly cure this singularity .",
    "another relevant avenue that we have not pursued in this thesis is the analysis of the meson spectrum in presence of the electric field .",
    "following our general approach , we can further analyze the effect of a chemical potential in both these holographic models .",
    "the phase structure of thermal @xmath17 yang - mills was analyzed in presence of a finite baryon density in ref .",
    "@xcite ; similar study was carried out in the type iia model first in ref .",
    "@xcite and later in refs .",
    "it is natural to further introduce an external electric - magnetic field and investigate their effect .",
    "it turns out to have a rich phenomenology .",
    "turning on both magnetic field and chemical potential has many interesting features , _",
    "e.g. _ it induces an axial current in the type iia model .",
    "work along this direction has been discussed in refs .",
    "this phenomenological richness is mainly sourced by the non - vanishing chern - simons term supported by the worldvolume of the probe branes .",
    "this non - vanishing chern - simons term is equivalent to the inclusion of the axial anomaly in the flavour sector of the dual field theory .",
    "it is further noteworthy that the effect of such axial anomaly terms within qcd has been recently studied in the context of the rhic physics and new phenomena , _",
    "e.g. _ the chiral magnetic effect@xcite , have been predicted .",
    "it is rather encouraging that similar effects are also observed within the type iia model .",
    "the role of finite chemical potential was studied within the type iib model in _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite and later generalized to isospin chemical potential in ref .",
    "interestingly this model also shows remarkable phenomenological richness when a magnetic field is further introduced .",
    "this has recently been studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where upon a further analysis a holographic berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition has also been observed@xcite .",
    "undoubtedly both these models have remarkable rich features .",
    "let us now go back and comment on the main theme of this thesis : the physics of chiral symmetry breaking . as we have noted",
    "earlier what we have called chiral symmetry in the models we discussed are quite different .",
    "we also noted that the symmetry breaking pattern in the type iia model , _",
    "i.e. _ the u@xmath698u@xmath699u@xmath700 , is much closer to the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd which we ultimately aim to understand better .",
    "this therefore poses a question : whether one can realize similar symmetry breaking pattern within some other brane - construction or supergravity background .",
    "to slightly rephrase this question , we can focus on the fact that despite the beautiful realization of chiral symmetry breaking in the witten - sakai - sugimoto model it has some serious drawbacks : _",
    "e.g. _ the string coupling is not constant and diverges in the uv .",
    "furthermore , the dual field theory is really a @xmath62-dimensional gauge theory compactified on a circle and not a true @xmath15-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "one is thus led to consider other possible supergravity models which might realize the chiral symmetry breaking pattern as the witten - sakai - sugimoto model but do not suffer from its drawbacks .    recently in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar chiral symmetry breaking mechanism has been proposed by considering probe d7anti - d7 branes in the klebanov - witten background@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this construction has been further generalized for the klebanov - strassler background@xcite .",
    "note that both these models are within the type iib supergravity framework .",
    "evidently , these constructions provide us with the opportunity to explore more",
    ". it would be very interesting to consider the effect of an external electric - magnetic field excited on the worldvolume of the probe brane  anti - brane system .",
    "although the finite temperature klebanov - strassler background is not analytically known ( for more details see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) and therefore hard to analyze , the zero temperature physics may still contain a rich physics .",
    "a crucial ingredient of our analysis is the large @xmath0 and the @xmath230 limit . in the real world",
    "we have @xmath701 , thus a probe computation is not sufficient .",
    "instead one needs to consider the effect of the backreaction of the probe flavour branes on the background .",
    "early attempts to include backreaction in the type iib model has been discussed in _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "some recent work has also been done to include the backreaction of the probe branes in the witten - sakai - sugimoto model in ref .",
    "however , this remains a much less controllable scenario .",
    "similar attempts have also been made to include the backreaction in _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite in the flavoured klebanov - witten and the klebanov - strassler model that we have not discussed here .    nonetheless , we hope we made a convincing case in favour of using the techniques of gauge - gravity duality to shed light on strong coupling dynamics .",
    "let us now offer some comments from a broader perspective .",
    "string theory eventually emerged as a potential candidate theory for quantum gravity , however many aspects of this theory still remain poorly - understood . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum field theories are much better understood .",
    "thus , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gauge - gravity duality can itself serve as a definition of a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "the concrete examples of this gauge - gravity duality within string theory is therefore an exciting prospect .",
    "it is also natural to construct more such interesting examples .",
    "continuing on this thought , it is tempting to ask whether we can realize the gravity duals of everyday systems .",
    "there are many condensed matter systems which are described by strongly coupled , scale invariant theories .",
    "these include high @xmath702 superconductors near their quantum critical point , fermions at unitarity _ etc .",
    "_ at the time of writing , constructing and analyzing gravity duals of various strongly coupled condensed matter phenomena is an extremely active and developing field of research .",
    "we refer to the refs .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of the current progress .    in conclusion",
    "we hope our approach of learning strong coupling dynamics by using the gauge - gravity duality , in one way or the other , will teach us interesting and useful lessons .",

    "the main result of this exercise is that the high spin meson dissociates once a critical value of the acceleration is reached .",

    "we take the former point of view .",
    "the metric for the rindler space can be written as @xmath863 where @xmath632-plane represents the plane where we would rotate the string . to add a background magnetic field we consider similar potential @xmath864 given before . now",
    "the ansatz for the string in terms of its worldvolume coordinates @xmath636 is given by @xmath865 this ansatz implies that the direction of acceleration of the string is orthogonal to the direction of its rotation .",
    "we can readily see that there are two conserved charges associated with the string , namely the angular momentum @xmath507 , which is associated with the rotation along @xmath78-direction and the boost charge , which is associated with the translation in @xmath299-direction .",
    "the nambu - goto action for the string now will be accompanied by a boundary term exactly similar to the term @xmath866 given in eqn .",
    "( [ eqt : action ] ) . therefore the full action is given by @xmath867 varying this action we can obtain the equation of motion for the string profile and the boundary conditions we should impose . in absence of any external field this exercise has been carried out in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we do not repeat here .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field enforces us to impose the following boundary condition @xmath868 where @xmath869 is the distance between the two end points of the string .",

    ", the presence of the background magnetic field does not change the equations of motion for the nambu - goto string .",
    "therefore the functional form of the string profile given in equation ( [ eqt : rsol ] ) is entirely determined by the rindler geometry@xcite .",
    "we notice that the presence of the magnetic field does induce an effective length @xmath875 by changing the boundary condition of the string end - points .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath282 brings about two key changes in the evaluation of the angular momentum .",
    "the profile of the string modifies in order to satisfy the boundary condition in eqn .",
    "( [ eqt : bcr ] ) and therefore the effective length @xmath876 arises in the formula in ( [ eqt : rsol ] ) .",
    "there is also an additional explicit contribution @xmath877 of the form shown in eqn .",
    "( [ eqt : ej ] ) , which finally gives a functional factor of @xmath878 in the expression for the angular momentum .",
    "it can be shown that the explicit contribution of the of the magnetic field to the angular momentum , denoted by @xmath877 , is actually cancelled by a term coming from integrating over the string profile .",
    "the net resulting angular momentum therefore can be lower than the angular momentum of the string in absence of the field .",
    "this is pictorially summarised in figure [ fig : jomegab ] .    to find the maximum acceleration we identify @xmath879 and look for minima of the right hand side of the equation as a function of the parameter @xmath813 .",
    "for now we content ourselves with only positive values of @xmath282 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the string angular momentum and the background field are parallel .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that such minima corresponds to values of @xmath813 which satisfy the following equation ( obtained from taking the first derivative of @xmath870 and setting it equal to zero at @xmath880 ) @xmath881^{-1/2}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly the parameter @xmath282 generates a set of such values of @xmath813 which satisfy the above equation and therefore promotes the maximum value of acceleration to a function of the magnetic field . differentiating the eqn . in the first line of ( [ eqt : solve ] ) and using identities for the trigonometric hyperbolic functions we obtain that the family of roots of the equation can be simply given by the relation @xmath882 where @xmath883 is a constant .",
    "alternatively we could imagine the rindler space to be the near - horizon approximation of a blackhole background and the acceleration is along the holographic coordinate ( we make the identification that @xmath885 , where @xmath88 is the radial coordinate in the holographic set up ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath886 ( in eqn .",
    "( [ eqt : rmet ] ) ) in this case represents the surface gravity and sets the temperature of the dual gauge theory to be @xmath887 .",

    "( [ eqt : ransatz ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of the set up is different from the earlier one ; however this brings about no change as far as the mathematics is concerned .",
    "we therefore again obtain the string profile as given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqt : rsol ] ) .",
    "however in this case the physical parameter that captures the dissociation of the meson is the size @xmath869 ( which sets the angular momentum @xmath507 via the relation in eqn .",
    "( [ eqt : rsol ] ) ) of it .",
    "the length is obtained to be @xmath889^{-1}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we would hope to see that for a given value of @xmath442 , there exists a maximum admissible size of the spinning meson beyond which it dissociates .",
    "we can treat as before the parameter @xmath813 to be independent with respect to which we will consider maximizing the length function @xmath869 . from eqn .",
    "( [ eqt : rlen ] ) it is clear that the external magnetic field does not play any role to determine the value of @xmath813 corresponding to the maximum of @xmath869 ; however it determines the the function @xmath890 and therefore also @xmath891 to be given by @xmath892^{-1}\\ , \\\\ & & j_{\\rm max}\\propto \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right ) \\left[\\arcsin\\left(1/\\sqrt{1+h^2}\\right)\\right]^{-2 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constants of proportionality depends on the background temperature @xmath96 and the parameter @xmath442 .    for",
    "the background considered in the main text the rindler spacetime does emerge when we zoom in the region close to the horizon@xcite . the toy model here",
    "can therefore be identified with a corresponding study of high spin mesons in the overheated phase .",
    "so if we want to make a direct connection between the rindler background dynamics to the specific system studied in the text , we should remember that such a background appears precisely in the over - heated phase of the system , where any small fluctuation is likely to destroy the meson and drive the over - heated phase to the melted phase .",
