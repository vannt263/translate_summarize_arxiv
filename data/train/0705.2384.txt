    "amorphous semiconductors are among the most important electronic materials . _",
    "a - si : h _ is the universal choice for tft applications in laptop displays and important photovoltaic material .",
    "thin films of a - si : h are one of the promising active elements for uncooled microbolometers@xcite as employed in focal plane arrays for night vision applications . here , the temperature ( t ) dependence of the electrical conductivity , and the temperature coefficient of resistance ( tcr ) is of paramount importance .",
    "experiments suggest that there are well - defined conductivity regimes : variable - range hopping at the lowest temperatures , phonon - induced delocalization at higher temperatures and ultimately a metallic form of conduction ( albeit with strong scattering ) .",
    "the venerable meyer - neldel rule@xcite ( mnr ) correlating the exponential prefactor of the dc conductivity with the activation energy has been observed to be almost universally valid in disordered systems .",
    "a microscopic understanding of these effects is highly incomplete , though significant progress has been made on mnr@xcite .",
    "disordered solids pose definite challenges for transport modeling .",
    "the boltzmann equation is best suited to long mean free paths , and is difficult to apply in these systems with localized states and defects .",
    "moreover , the topological disorder must have a significant influence on the conduction and a realistic calculation of transport must include this disorder explicitly ( eg through a credible structural model ) .",
    "modern density functional simulations of materials routinely provide the kohn - sham@xcite eigenvalues and orbitals at each step in a thermal molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation .",
    "the natural approximate connection of these quantities to electrical transport is provided by the kubo - greenwood formula ( kgf)kubo , greenwood .",
    "the first application of the kgf to an atomistic model with computed electronic structure was by allen and broughton@xcite for ( metallic ) liquid si with a tight - binding hamiltonian . in this paper",
    ", we explore the utility of the kgf with kohn - sham spectral properties to estimate the temperature dependence of the conductivity in _ a - si _ and _ a - si : h_. an adiabatic approximation is used for modeling the inelastic scattering of the phonons ( by thermally averaging the kgf over a constant t md trajectory ) .",
    "the underlying idea is that if the thermal fluctuations drive the unoccupied and occupied states close together ( in the spirit of landau - zener@xcite tunneling ) , then the energy conserving @xmath1 functions are nonzero , and a finite contribution to the conductivity is made by such instantaneous  snapshots \" if the dipole matrix element is non - zero .",
    "doping , the mnr and tcr are obtained and shown to be in reasonable agreement with measurements in _ a - si : h_. the results are sufficiently encouraging to justify a fuller exploration of the applicability of the method to disordered systems more generally , including other amorphous semiconductors and glasses and conducting polymers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the underlying logic of the approach and some salient previous calculations , in section iii , we briefly describe models and simulation procedures employed . in section iv , we present results for _ a - si _ and _ a - si : h _ including the t - dependent conductivity , the effect of doping on the conductivity and a discussion of mnr and tcr for _ a - si : h_. finally in section v we draw conclusions .",
    "previous work on amorphous semiconductors and glasses has shown that kohn - sham eigenvalues conjugate to localized kohn - sham states are specially susceptible to the motion of the lattice@xcite ( thermal fluctuation in the atomic coordinates involved in localized states leads to a strong modulation of such eigenvalues and eigenvectors ) .",
    "indeed , the rms fluctuation of eigenvalues conjugate to localized eigenvectors is proportional to the localization of the eigenvector as measured by inverse participation ratio@xcite .",
    "localized states appear in the gap , or in the spectral band tails .",
    "since they are close to the fermi level , they play a role in transport .",
    "the most elementary link between these states and energies and the conductivity is the kgf , which is a natural approach to strong scattering systems with short mean free paths . with this in mind",
    ", we use the kubo formalism and current _ ab initio _ methods in conjunction with fairly realistic ( structurally plausible ) supercell models of _ a - si : h _ to probe the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity .",
    "the novelty of our work lies in 1 ) using kohn - sham states and energies in kubo s expression for the conductivity and 2 ) adopting a born - oppenheimer@xcite like approximation of thermally averaging the kgf ( using instantaneous atomic configurations obtained in the course of a thermal simulation at constant temperature as  snapshots \" ) .",
    "such an approach certainly has limitations : for low temperatures in which one expects variable range hopping between defects the correct link to first principle simulation would seem to require solutions of the time - dependent kohn - sham equations@xcite or an approach more akin to a miller - abrahams@xcite model of the conductivity .",
    "there are several studies which use the kgf to compute the static lattice conductivity of amorphous materials  @xcite .",
    "the computed conductivity vanishes for localized states in a static lattice .    as an alternative to the weak scattering theory of ziman@xcite for liquid metals ,",
    "investigators have used the kgf with variants of car - parrinello@xcite simulation to explore the conductivity of liquid metals including for example , l - nasn alloys@xcite and l - nasilvestrelli , with quite satisfactory results .",
    "it was found that brillouin zone sampling had to be treated with care , which is reasonable for a metallic system .",
    "the success of such calculations is one motivation to extend the approach to doped amorphous semiconductors@xcite .",
    "another significant development of recent years is the keldysh green s function approach offered to properly handle the effects of contacts and finite potential drops for molecular electronics .",
    "an example of this approach is the code transiesta@xcite .",
    "the kgf has been applied on many occasions , and in liquids in a mode very similar to what we report here .",
    "however , there is usually no discussion of the underlying assumptions that connect the original many - body formulation of the kgf to its usual use with md averages and single particle states .",
    "for example , the kgf as used in these computations is _ not _ formulated for use with inelastic processes , and thus the use of md trajectories and averaging requires some discussion , which we offer in this section .",

    "the dc conductivity is computed from trajectory averaged quantities such as : @xmath59 where the bar denotes the average and we emphasize the dependence of the various terms on the simulation time @xmath60 .",
    "this average then picks up thermal broadening effects in the density of states , and also include time - dependence in the dipole matrix element .",
    "a gaussian approximant for the @xmath61 function with a width of 0.05 ev is used in our calculations .",
    "we have repeated our calculations for widths between [ 0.01 - 0.1 ] ev , and our results do not change appreciably .",
    "we insert thermally averaged diagonal elements as in eqn .",

    "the kgf includes three possible transitions : ( i ) localized state to localized state ; ( ii ) localized state to extended state ; ( iii ) extended state to extended state . for amorphous semiconductors ,",
    "the upper tail of valence band and the lower tail of conduction band are localized .",
    "below room temperature , carriers are mainly distributed in localized states , and ( i ) is dominant conduction mechanism .",
    "with increasing temperature , there are more holes in the upper valence tail , which are available for the electrons in lower side of mobility edge to transit . in addition",
    ", the activation energy is lowered by thermal fluctuations . at higher temperature , ( ii )",
    "becomes more important until there are enough carriers in extended states , and ( iii ) will becomes the most effective conduction channel .",
    "it is believed@xcite that the temperature range from _ ca _ 300k-700k is dominated by ",
    "phonon - induced delocalization\"@xcite , in which the phonons aid the hopping ( though not to the extent of polaron formation ) .",
    "phonon - induced delocalization has been computed from the time - dependent kohn - sham equation@xcite .",
    "it was observed that if electron energies became close ( because of phonon - induced variation in energies ) , mixing between the nearly degenerate states could occur , which results in delocalization@xcite .",
    "this leads to a monotonic and irreversible decrease in electron localization . in the present calculation ,",
    "the localization fluctuates ( see fig . 2 of ref . ) .",
    "thus , our calculation ignores the explicit phonon - driven delocalization except in so far as this effect is captured in the thermal averaging scheme .",
    "there are sources of error in any calculation of this type , which we must mention : ( 1 ) we use the kohn - sham states computed in the lda as input into the kgf .",
    "( 2 ) we employ very small structural models ( _ ca _ 70 atoms ) ; ( 3 ) except for a few test cases , we have used a minimal ( single - zeta ) basis .",
    "in fact we do this in part because this approximation gives a gap close to the physical gap in _ a - si _ ; ( 4 ) our simulations run for finite time , though we have taken some care to verify that the reported conductivities are adequately converged ; ( 5 ) there are physical mechanisms that should broaden the density of states .",
    "two of these arise from brillouin zone integration and the sparse and discrete sampling of the tail states due to the small cell size .",
    "( 6 ) classical dynamics ( no quantization of the vibrations ) is employed throughout .",
    "these errors are largely systematic , and as such , difficult to measure",
    ".    on the other hand , there are conditions that ameliorate the situation . where point ( 1 ) is concerned : quasiparticle calculations for crystalline si computed in the gw approximation and the kohn - sham states are nearly identical@xcite . also , there is a strong thermal averaging effect : even at room temperature , localized tail states can fluctuate by tenths of an ev ( far greater than @xmath62 ) ; this helps significantly in connection with points ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) above .",
    "finally , there is a convincing body of empirical evidence that the kgf employed as we do here ( or with more primitive hamiltonians ) provides reasonably quantitative predictions for the dc conductivity .",
    "the use of a sz basis is convenient computationally , and has the helpful feature that the gap is much closer to experiment than a complete basis calculation .",
    "the _ ab initio _ local orbital code siesta @xcite was used to perform the density functional calculations .",
    "we used a local density approximation for the exchange ( lda ) using the perdew and zunger expression  @xcite .",

    "we used the @xmath64 point to sample the brillouin zone in all calculations .",
    "no scissors correction was used since the sz optical gap is close to experiment ( a scissors shift is necessary for a polarized basis ) .",
    "we have used two different well relaxed models of @xmath65 ( 64 si atoms )  @xcite and @xmath66 ( 61 si and 10 h atoms )  @xcite models .",
    "we have prepared these models for six different temperatures 200k , 300k , 500k , 700k , 1000k , and 1500k . in each cases",
    "we followed the following procedures .",
    "the two models were annealed to a particular temperature for 1.5 ps which is followed by equilibration for another 1.5 ps .",
    "once the models are well equilibrated , we performed a constant temperature md simulation for another 500 steps to obtain an average dc conductivity for the respected models at a given temperature .",

    "though it requires further investigation ( by using various dopants in @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , we observe the meyer - neldel rule with exponential behavior for the pre - exponential factor @xmath121 .",
    "the computed result for tcr is in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "further study of this method involves using a richer basis set , and fuller k - point sampling in the brillouin zone ( or essentially equivalently , larger cells ) . further",
    " deconstruction \" of the kgf will be undertaken to explore the instantaneous configurations that provide significant contributions to @xmath122 .",
    "our work shows that the simplest implementation of the kgf shows promise for computing the electrical conductivity of disordered semiconductors , and this success hints that it may be used with profit on other systems beside .",
