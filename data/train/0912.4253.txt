    "it is fair to say that the two - dimensional ising model has a very particular historical importance in statistical mechanics .",
    "this model of ferromagnetism has been the first natural model where the existence of a phase transition , a property common to many statistical mechanics models , has been proved , in peierls 1936 work @xcite . in a series of seminal papers ( particularly @xcite ) ,",
    "onsager computed several macroscopic quantities associated with this model .",
    "since then , the ising model has attracted a lot of attention , and it has probably been one of the most studied models , giving birth to an extensive literature , both mathematical and physical .",
    "a few decades later , in 1969 , fortuin and kasteleyn introduced a dependent percolation model , for which the probability of a configuration is weighted by the number of clusters ( connected components ) that it contains .",
    "this percolation representation turned out to be extremely powerful to study the ising model , and by now it has become known as the _ random - cluster _ model , or the _ fortuin - kasteleyn percolation _  _ fk percolation _ for short .",
    "recall that on a finite graph @xmath0 , the fk percolation process with parameters @xmath1 is obtained by assigning to each configuration @xmath2 a probability proportional to @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denote respectively the number of open edges , closed edges , and connected components in @xmath2 .",
    "the definition of the model also involves the use of _ boundary conditions _ , encoding connections taking place outside @xmath0 .",
    "the boundary conditions can be seen as a set of additionnal edges between sites on the outer boundary , and they will play a central role in this article . the precise setup that we consider in this paper is presented in section 2 .    for the specific value @xmath7 , the fk percolation provides a _ geometric representation _ of the ising model _ via _ the _ edwards - sokal coupling _ @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we restrict ourselves here to this value @xmath7 , and we call this model the _ fk ising model_. we also stick to the square lattice @xmath8  or subgraphs of it  though our arguments could possibly be carried out in the more general context of isoradial graphs , as in @xcite . note that our results are stated for the fk representation , but that the edwards - sokal coupling then allows one to translate them into results for the ising model itself .",
    "for instance , 2-point connection probabilities for the fk ising model correspond via this coupling to 2-spin correlation functions for the ising model .    for the value @xmath7 and @xmath8 as an underlying graph ,",
    "the model features a phase transition  in the infinite - volume limit  at the critical and self - dual point @xmath9 : for @xmath10 , there is a.s . no infinite open cluster , while for @xmath11 , there is a.s . a unique one .",
    "these two regimes , known as sub - critical and super - critical , have totally different macroscopic behaviors . between them",
    "lies a very interesting and rich regime , the critical regime , corresponding to the value @xmath12 .",
    "its behavior is intimately related to the behavior of the model through its phase transition , as indicated in particular by the scaling theory .    in this paper , we prove lower and upper bounds for crossing probabilities in rectangles of bounded aspect ratio . these bounds are uniform in the size of the rectangles and in the boundary conditions , and they are analogues for the fk ising model to the celebrated russo - seymour - welsh bounds for percolation @xcite .",
    "formally , we consider _ rectangles _ @xmath13 on the square lattice , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and translations of it  here and in the following , @xmath16 denotes the integer interval between the two ( real ) end - points , _ i.e. _ the interval @xmath17 \\cap \\mathbb{z}^2 $ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the event that there exists a _ vertical crossing _ in @xmath13 , a path from the bottom side @xmath19 to the top side @xmath20 which consists only of open edges .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ rsw ] let @xmath21 .",
    "there exist two constants @xmath22 ( depending only on @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) such that for any rectangle @xmath13 with side lengths @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( _ i.e. _ with aspect ratio bounded away from @xmath27 and @xmath28 by @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , one has @xmath29 for _ any _ boundary conditions @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the fk measure on @xmath13 with parameters @xmath32 and boundary conditions @xmath30 .",
    "these bounds are in some sense a first glimpse of scale invariance .",
    "it was widely believed in the physics literature that the fk ising model at criticality , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath12 , should possess a strong property of conformal invariance in the scaling limit @xcite .",
    "a precise mathematical meaning was recently established by smirnov in a groundbreaking paper @xcite .",
    "one of the main tools there is the so - called _ preholomorphic fermionic observable _ , a complex observable that allows one to make appear harmonicity on the discrete level .",
    "this property can then be used to take continuum limits and describe the scaling limits so - obtained .",
    "our proof mostly relies on smirnov s observable .",
    "more precisely , it is based on precise estimates on connection probabilities for boundary vertices , that allow us to use a second - moment method on the number of pairs of connected sites . for that",
    ", we use smirnov s observable to reveal some harmonicity on the discrete level , which enables us to express macroscopic quantities such as connection probabilities in terms of discrete harmonic measures . note in addition that other recent works @xcite also suggest that this complex observable is a relevant way to look at fk percolation , both for @xmath7 and for other values of @xmath33 .",
    "we would like to stress that our argument is intended to be self - contained and that it stays completely in a discrete setting , using essentially elementary combinatorial tools : in particular , we do not make use of any continuum limits @xcite .",
    "crossing bounds turned out to be instrumental to study the percolation model at and near its phase transition  for instance to derive the _ scaling relations _",
    "@xcite , that link the main macroscopic observables , such as the density of the infinite cluster and the characteristic length .",
    "these bounds are also useful to study variations of percolation , in particular for models exhibiting a self - organized critical behavior .",
    "we thus expect theorem [ rsw ] to be of particular interest to study the fk ising model at and near criticality .",
    "this theorem allows us to derive easily several noteworthy results . among the consequences that we state ,",
    "let us mention the celebrated fact that there is no magnetization at criticality for the ising model , first established by onsager in @xcite , tightness results for the interfaces coming from the aizenman - burchard technology , and the value @xmath34 of the one - arm half - plane exponent  that describes the asymptotic probability of large - distance connections starting from a boundary point , and also the decay of boundary magnetization in the ising model .",
    "it should also be instrumental to prove the existence of critical exponents , in particular of the _ arm exponents_.    theorem [ rsw ] appears to be a very useful tool , enabling to transfer properties of the scaling limit objects back to the discrete models .",
    "connections between discrete models and their continuum counterparts usually involve decorrelation of different scales , and thus use spatial independence between regions which are far enough from each other . in the random cluster model",
    ", one usually addresses the lack of spatial independence by successive conditionings , using repeatedly the spatial ( or domain ) markov property of fk percolation , by which what happens outside a given domain can be encoded by appropriate boundary conditions . for this reason",
    ", proving bounds that are _ uniform in the boundary conditions _ seems to be very important .",
    "we would also like to mention that other proofs of russo - seymour - welsh - type bounds have already been proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "chelkak and smirnov give a direct and elegant argument to explicitly compute the crossing probabilities in the scaling limit , but their argument only applies for some specific boundary conditions ( alternatively wired and free on the four sides ) . in @xcite ,",
    "camia and newman also propose to obtain rsw as a corollary of a recently announced result : the convergence of the full collection of interfaces for the ising model @xcite to the conformal loop ensemble cle(3 ) .",
    "the interpretation of cle(3 ) in terms of the brownian loop soup @xcite is also used . however , to the author s knowledge , the proofs of these two results are quite involved , and moreover , the reasoning proposed only applies for boundary conditions `` in the bulk '' , that correspond to the infinite - volume limit . in these two cases , uniformity with respect to the boundary conditions is not addressed , and there does not seem to be an easy argument to avoid this difficulty . while weaker forms might be sufficient for some applications",
    ", it seems however that this stronger form is needed in many important cases , and that it considerably shortens several existing arguments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we first remind the reader of the basic features of the fk percolation , as well as properties of smirnov s fermionic observable . in section 3",
    ", we compare the observable to harmonic measures , and we establish some estimates on these harmonic measures .",
    "these estimates are instrumental in the proof of theorem [ rsw ] , which we perform in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to presenting the consequences that we mentioned .",
    "in order to remain as self - contained as possible , we recall some basic features of the random - cluster models . some of these properties , like the fortuin - kasteleyn - ginibre ( fkg ) inequality , are common to many statistical mechanics models .",
    "the reader can consult the reference book @xcite for more details , and proofs of the results stated .      the random - cluster ( or _ fk percolation _",
    ") measure can be defined on any finite graph , but here we only consider finite subgraphs @xmath0 of the square lattice @xmath35 .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the boundary of such a subgraph @xmath0 , that is , the vertices having _ less than four adjacent edges _  notice that this definition is non standard .",
    "a _ configuration _",
    "@xmath2 is a random subgraph given by the vertices of @xmath0 , together with some subset of edges between them .",
    "an edge of @xmath0 is called _ open _ if it belongs to @xmath2 , and _ closed _ otherwise . two sites",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are said to be _ connected _ if there is an _",
    "open path _  a path composed of open edges only  connecting them , which is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , two sets of vertices @xmath40 and @xmath41 are said to be connected if there exist two sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , and we use the notation @xmath45 .",
    "we also abbreviate @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "sites can be grouped into ( maximal ) connected components , usually called _",
    "contrary to usual independent percolation , the edges in the fk percolation model are dependent of each other , a fact which makes the notion of _ boundary conditions _ important .",
    "formally , a set @xmath30 of boundary conditions is a set of `` abstract '' edges , each connecting two boundary vertices , that encodes how these vertices are connected outside @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the graph obtained by adding the new edges in @xmath30 to the configuration @xmath2 .",
    "we are now in a position to define the fk percolation measure itself , for any parameters @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 . denoting by @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) the number of open ( resp . closed ) edges of @xmath2 , and by @xmath51 the number of connected components in @xmath48 , the fk percolation process on @xmath0 with parameters @xmath52 , @xmath33 and boundary conditions @xmath30 is obtained by taking @xmath53 as a probability for any configuration @xmath2 on @xmath0 , where @xmath54 is an appropriate normalizing constant , called the _ partition function_.    among all the possible boundary conditions , two of them play a particular role . on the one hand ,",
    "the _ free _ boundary conditions correspond to the case when there are no extra edges connecting boundary vertices , we denote by @xmath55 the corresponding measure . on the other hand , the _ wired _",
    "boundary conditions correspond to the case when all the boundary vertices are pair - wise connected , and the corresponding measure is denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "the different edges of an fk percolation model being highly dependent , what happens in a given domain depends on the configuration outside the domain",
    ". however , the fk percolation model possesses a very convenient property known as the _ domain markov property _ , which usually makes it possible to obtain some spatial independence .",
    "this property is really instrumental in all our proofs .",
    "consider a graph @xmath0 , with @xmath57 its set of vertices .",
    "for a subset @xmath58 , consider the graph @xmath59 having @xmath60 as a set of vertices , and the edges of @xmath0 connecting sites of @xmath60 as a set of edges .",
    "then for any boundary conditions @xmath61 , @xmath62 conditioned to match some configuration @xmath2 outside @xmath0 is equal to @xmath63 , where @xmath30 is the set of connections inherited from @xmath2 . in other words , one can encode , using appropriate boundary conditions @xmath30 , the influence of the configuration outside @xmath0 .      the random - cluster model with parameters",
    "@xmath49 $ ] and @xmath64 on a finite graph @xmath0 has the _ strong positive association property_. more precisely , it satisfies the so - called holley criterion , a fact which has two important consequences .",
    "a first consequence is the well - known _ fkg inequality _",
    "@xmath65 for any pair of _ increasing _ events @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( increasing events are defined in the usual way @xcite ) and any boundary conditions @xmath30 .",
    "this correlation inequality is fundamental to study fk percolation , for instance to combine several increasing events such as the existence of crossings in various rectangles .",
    "a second property implied by the strong positive association is the following monotonicity between boundary conditions , which is particularly useful when combined with the domain markov property .",
    "for any boundary conditions @xmath68 ( all the connections present in @xmath61 belong to @xmath30 as well ) , we have @xmath69 for any increasing event @xmath66 that depends only on @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath62 is stochastically dominated by @xmath70 ( denoted by @xmath71 ) .",
    "in particular , this property directly implies that the free and wired boundary conditions are extremal in the sense of stochastic ordering : for any set of boundary conditions @xmath30 , one has @xmath72    an infinite - volume measure can be constructed as the increasing limit of fk percolation measures on the nested sequence of graphs @xmath73 with free boundary conditions .",
    "for any fixed @xmath50 , classical arguments then show that there must exist a critical point @xmath74 such that for any @xmath75 , there is almost surely no infinite cluster of sites , while for @xmath76 , there is almost surely one ( see @xcite for example ) .      in two dimensions , an fk measure on a subgraph @xmath0 of @xmath8 with free boundary conditions can be associated with a dual measure in a natural way , as we explain now .",
    "the dual graph @xmath77 is obtained by putting a vertex at the center of each face of @xmath8 having an edge in @xmath0 .",
    "the edges are connecting any two adjacent vertices for which the corresponding faces are separated by an edge of @xmath0 .",
    "the fk percolation model @xmath78 is then dual to the measure @xmath79 , where @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 one then expects the critical point @xmath82 to be the self - dual point @xmath83 for which @xmath84 , whose value can easily be derived : @xmath85      for the value @xmath7 of the parameter , the fk percolation model is related to the ising model .",
    "more precisely , if starting from an fk percolation sample , one assigns uniformly at random a spin @xmath86 or @xmath87 to each cluster as a whole ( sites in the same cluster get the same spin ) , independently , we get simply a sample of the ising model .",
    "this coupling is called the _ edwards - sokal coupling _ @xcite .    in this case , the fk percolation model is now well - understood .",
    "the value @xmath88 is implied by the computation by kaufman and onsager @xcite of the partition function of the ising model , and an alternative proof has been proposed recently by beffara , duminil - copin and smirnov @xcite . moreover , in @xcite , smirnov proved conformal invariance of this model at the self - dual point @xmath89 .    in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the fk percolation model with parameters @xmath7 and @xmath90 ( so that we forget the dependence on @xmath52 and @xmath33 ) , which is also known as the _ critical fk ising model _",
    " we often call it the fk ising model for short .",
    "in this part , we recall discrete analyticity and discrete harmonicity results for the fk ising model , established by smirnov in @xcite .",
    "these results are crucial in our proofs since they will allow us to compare connection probabilities to harmonic measures .",
    "_ recall that from now , @xmath7 and @xmath91_.      let @xmath92 be a _",
    "finite _ subgraph of the primal lattice @xmath8 such that @xmath93 is a self - avoiding polygon where @xmath94 is the set of edges between boundary sites .",
    "hence , @xmath95 , the connected component of @xmath96 containing the graph , is a bounded and simply connected domain .",
    "consider two sites @xmath97 and @xmath98 of the boundary of @xmath92 .",
    "they determine two arcs of @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , obtained by following @xmath94 in the counterclockwise direction from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , and conversely .",
    "we consider a random cluster measure with free boundary conditions on @xmath100 , and wired boundary conditions on @xmath101 .",
    "these boundary conditions are called the _ dobrushin boundary conditions _ on @xmath102 , @xmath100 is called the _",
    "free _ arc and @xmath101 the _ wired arc_.",
    "we denote by @xmath103 the associated random cluster measure with parameters @xmath7 and @xmath91 .",
    "this measure has a very nice representation on the so - called medial graph of @xmath92 , which we define now .",
    "we first define the _ medial lattice _ associated with the square lattice @xmath8 . in order to do that , consider together @xmath8 with its dual @xmath104 , and declare _ black _ the sites of the primal lattice @xmath8 , and _ white _ the sites of the dual lattice @xmath104 .",
    "we then introduce the graph obtained by replacing every site by a colored diamond , as on figure [ fig : medial_lattice ] .",
    "we obtain in this way a rotated copy of the square lattice ( scaled by a factor @xmath105 ) , denoted by @xmath106 .",
    "the sites of the primal ( resp .",
    "dual ) lattice are thus associated with the black ( resp .",
    "white ) faces : we use extensively in the proof this correspondence between sites of the primal and of the dual lattices , and faces of the medial lattice .",
    "for instance , we say that two black diamonds are connected if the corresponding sites of the primal lattice are connected .",

    "@xmath108 of @xmath102 by considering the diamonds intersecting @xmath95 , together with the white diamonds touching the free arc @xmath101 ( see figure [ fig : medial_lattice ] ) .",
    "these white diamonds form the _ free arc _ of @xmath108 , the black diamonds corresponding to sites of the wired arc of @xmath92 form the _ wired arc _ of @xmath108 .",
    "the corners of diamonds _ not belonging _ to the two arcs of @xmath108 define the _ vertices _ of @xmath108 .",
    "the _ edges _ are the edges of @xmath106 between two vertices .",
    "we adopt the following convenient convention : the two edges @xmath109 and @xmath110 of @xmath106 ( resp .",
    "adjacent to @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) that `` separate '' the free and the wired arcs of @xmath108 are considered as edges of @xmath108 .",
    "the two definitions of arcs ( for @xmath92 and @xmath108 ) are quite similar .",
    "nevertheless , the free arc of @xmath92 is composed of sites of @xmath8 while the free arc of @xmath108 is composed of white diamonds of @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , vertices of @xmath108 possess two adjacent edges if they are `` on the boundary '' ( except next to @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) , and four otherwise .",
    "for any fk percolation configuration in @xmath92 , the interfaces between the primal clusters and the dual clusters ( if we follow the edges of the medial lattice ) form a family of loops , together with one path from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , called the _ exploration path _ , as shown on figure [ fig : loop_configuration ] .",
    "a simple rearrangement of ( [ def_fk ] ) shows that the probability of such a configuration is proportional to @xmath111  taking into account the fact that @xmath7 and @xmath112 .",
    "in addition to this , we put an orientation on the medial graph : we orient the edges of each black face in such a way that the arrows are in counter - clockwise order",
    ". it naturally gives an orientation to the loops , so that we are now working with a model of oriented curves on the medial lattice .",
    "if we consider a dobrushin domain @xmath102 , the slit domain created by `` removing '' the @xmath113 first steps of the exploration path is again a dobrushin domain .",
    "more precisely , consider the new arc @xmath114 composed of @xmath93 , together with the sites of @xmath92 adjacent to the exploration path .",

    "the exploration path @xmath118 is the interface between the primal open cluster connected to the wired arc and the dual open cluster connected to the free arc , so that , conditionally on @xmath118 , the law of the fk ising model in the new domain is exactly @xmath119,\\gamma(t),b}$ ] .",

    "if @xmath402 holds , then there are @xmath272 open paths , alternating with @xmath272 dual paths , connecting the inner boundary of the annulus to its outer boundary .",
    "moreover , one can decompose the annulus @xmath400 into roughly @xmath418 annuli of the form @xmath419 , so that it is actually sufficient to prove that @xmath420 for some constant @xmath421 .",
    "since the paths are alternating , one can deduce that there are @xmath272 open paths , each one being surrounded by two dual paths .",
    "hence , using successive conditionings and the domain markov property , the probability for each of them is smaller than the probability that there is a crossing in the annulus , which is less than some constant @xmath421 by corollary [ circuits ] ( note that this reasoning also holds on the boundary ) .",

    ", one can also obtain the value of the critical exponent for the boundary magnetization in the ising model , near a free boundary arc ( assuming it is smooth ) , and the corresponding one - arm half - plane exponent for the fk ising model .",

    "this probability can now be estimated exactly as in section [ section_proof ] : it is equal to the probability that the fk interface passes through @xmath27 ( since the origin is on the free boundary of @xmath398 ) , which is itself the modulus of the fermionic observable on @xmath163 evaluated at @xmath27 .",
    "now , it suffices to use proposition [ uniform comparability ] to compare this to the two harmonic measures , and then estimates similar to the estimates in lemmas [ lower_bound ] and [ upper_bound ] .",
    "this result can be equivalently stated for the one - arm half - plane probability for fk percolation :    consider the rectangle @xmath428 .",
    "there exist positive constants @xmath424 and @xmath425 such that for any boundary conditions @xmath30 such that the lower arc @xmath431 is free , one has @xmath432 uniformly over all @xmath25 .",

    ", we can enforce the existence of a crossing in the half - annulus @xmath433 that disconnects 0 from @xmath434 to the price of a constant independent of @xmath30 .",
    "using monotonicity and fkg , the probability that @xmath27 is connected by an open path to this crossing ( conditionally on its existence ) is larger than the probability that @xmath27 is connected to the boundary with wired boundary conditions , without conditioning .",
    "hence , the lower bound of the previous proposition gives the desired result .",
    "note that contrary to the power laws established using _ sle _ , there are no potential logarithmic corrections here  as is the case with the `` universal '' arm exponents for percolation ( corresponding to 2 and 3 arms in the half - plane , and 5 arms in the plane ) .",
    "furthermore , one can follow the same standard reasoning as for percolation , based on the rsw lower bound , to prove that the two- and three - arm half - plane exponents , with alternating `` types '' ( primal or dual ) , have values @xmath159 and @xmath435 respectively .      since the work of onsager @xcite , it is well - known that for the ising model at criticality , the magnetization at the middle of a square of side length @xmath436 with @xmath353 boundary conditions decays like @xmath437 .",
    "it is then tempting to say that the correlation of two spins at distance @xmath367 in the plane ( in the infinite - volume limit , say ) decays like @xmath438 , and this is indeed what happens . to the knowledge of the authors , there is no straightforward generalization of onsager s work that allows to derive this without difficult computations .",
    "however , this result can be made rigorous very easily with the help of theorem [ rsw ] .",
    "we give here only a result for two - point correlation functions , but exponents for @xmath25-spin correlations , for instance , can be obtained using exactly the same method .",
    "let us first interpret onsager s result in terms of the fk representation .",
    "let @xmath439 be the square @xmath440 with arbitrary boundary conditions @xmath30 .",
    "then there exist two constants @xmath424 and @xmath425 ( independent of @xmath367 and @xmath30 ) such that we have @xmath441    onsager s result gives the result with wired boundary conditions ( since it is derived in terms of the ising model with @xmath353 boundary conditions ) , so by monotonicity it gives the upper bound .",
    "using theorem [ rsw ] , we can obtain a lower bound independent of the boundary conditions by enforcing the existence of a circuit in the annulus @xmath442 , and using the fkg inequality .",
    "for that , we just need to lower the constant , using monotonicity : the connection probability conditionally on the fact that there is a wired annulus around the origin is larger than the connection probability with @xmath353 boundary conditions on @xmath443",
    ".    we can now give the result for two - point correlation functions in the infinite - volume ising model .",
    "consider the ising model on @xmath444 at critical temperature .",

    ", we get the upper bound .",
    "let us turn now to the lower bound .",
    "we can enforce the existence of a connected `` @xmath456 '' in the discrete domain @xmath457 \\setminus \\left [ ( x + b_{m})\\cup ( y + b_{m } ) \\right]\\ ] ] that surrounds both @xmath37 and @xmath38 and separates them : this costs only a positive constant @xmath458 , independent of @xmath367 , using theorem [ rsw ] in well - chosen rectangles and the fkg inequality .",
