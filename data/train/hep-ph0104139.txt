    "one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) is the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "this explains the existence of the pion and dictates most of the low energy phenomena in hadron physics .",
    "the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry is associated with the condensation of quark - anti - quark pairs in the qcd vacuum , @xmath3 , which is analogous to the condensation of cooper pairs in the theory of superconductivity @xcite . as the temperature ( @xmath4 ) and/or the baryon density ( @xmath5 ) increase ,",
    "the qcd vacuum undergoes a phase transition to the chirally symmetric phase where @xmath3 vanishes . studying what are the possible phase structure and how the phase transition takes place are one of the main aims of the modern hadron physics @xcite .",
    "when we talk about the phase structure , we need to fix appropriate variables to define the phases .",
    "such variables in qcd are current masses of light quarks ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "since the following relation holds , neglecting @xmath7 in the first approximation and studying the phase structure in the @xmath8-@xmath4-@xmath5 space would give us a good insight into the real world : @xmath9 here @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the critical temperature ( density ) .",
    "in fig.1 , possible phase structures in the @xmath8-@xmath4 plane ( with @xmath5=@xmath12 ) and @xmath8-@xmath5 plane ( with @xmath4=@xmath12 ) are shown .",

    "recent lattice simulations show @xmath15 mev for 3 ( 2 ) flavors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the first order transition for small @xmath8 turns into the second order one for large @xmath8 at the tricritical point @xcite .",
    "the precise value of @xmath8 at the tricritical point is not known yet .",
    "the phase transition at finite baryon density is not well understood mostly because the information from lattice qcd is poor .",
    "naive analysis based on the bag model shows the first order transition @xcite , which implies the existence of a mixed phase in the @xmath8-@xmath5 plane as shown in fig.1 ( right panel ) .",
    "however , the possibility of a smooth hadron - quark transition is not excluded .",
    "the bag model analysis also suggests the strange quark matter as the true ground state of matter for sufficiently small @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the system at finite baryon density , which is intrinsically quantum , is obviously richer in physics than that at finite @xmath4 and has various phases such as the color superconductivity , meson condensations , and baryon superfluidity ( see the reviews , @xcite ) .",

    "relevant degrees of freedom in each phase are also shown .",
    "@xmath16 is the normal nuclear matter density . ]",
    "now , what are the observables associated with the chiral transition ?",
    "model independent statement is that hadronic correlations in a same chiral multiplet ( such as @xmath17 ( scalar)@xmath18@xmath19 ( pseudo - scalar ) and @xmath20 ( vector)@xmath18@xmath21 ( axial - vector ) ) should be degenerate when @xmath22 , namely @xmath23 thermal susceptibilities for hadronic operators @xmath24 defined in the euclidian space , @xmath25 may be used to check such chiral degeneracy . shown in fig.2 is the full qcd simulation of @xmath26 on the lattice with 2 light flavors @xcite .",
    "one can see the degeneracy between the @xmath0-channel ( @xmath27=0 , @xmath28=@xmath29 ) and the @xmath30-channel ( @xmath27=1 , @xmath28=@xmath31 ) above the critical point .",
    "there remains a splitting between the @xmath32-channel ( @xmath27=1 , @xmath28=@xmath29 ) and the @xmath30-channel above the critical point , which reflects the breaking of @xmath33 symmetry .    to make a direct connection with the experimental observables",
    ", however , one needs to go further and calculate the minkowski ( real - time ) correlation and the hadronic spectral functions at finite @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the aim of this talk is to show some recent attempts toward this goal . in sec.2 and sec.3 ,",
    "the spectral function in the @xmath0-channel will be discussed near 2@xmath30 threshold where almost model - independent argument is possible .    ,",

    "the vertical ( horizontal ) axis denotes @xmath26 ( the lattice coupling @xmath36 ) . ]    experimentally , the resonances in the scalar and axial - vector channels have large width and are difficult to measure with possible exception discussed in sec.2,3 . for this reason , in - medium",
    "neutral vector - mesons which couple directly to the virtual photon have been studied both theoretically and experimentally as a probe of the chiral transition @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , theoretical calculations of the spectral function in the vector channel on the basis of the effective lagrangians are rather model dependent , and the first principle lattice qcd study has been called for . recently ,",
    "a new promising approach was proposed : it utilizes the maximum entropy method for extracting the spectral functions from lattice qcd data .",
    "we will discuss this new development in sec.4 .",
    "the fluctuation of the order parameter becomes large as the system approaches to the critical point of a second order or weak first order phase transition . in qcd",
    ", the fluctuation of the phase ( amplitude ) of the chiral order parameter @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath30 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the vital role of such fluctuations in the _ dynamical _ phenomena near the critical point at finite @xmath4 was originally studied in @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the chiral restoration gives rise to a softening ( the red - shift ) of the @xmath0 , which in turn leads to a small @xmath0-width due to the suppression of the phase - space of the decay @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 may appear as a narrow resonance at finite @xmath4 although it is at best a very broad resonance in the free space with a width comparable to its mass @xcite .",
    "( for the phenomenological applications of this idea in relation to the relativistic heavy ion collisions , see @xcite . )",
    "further theoretical analysis by taking account the coupling @xmath39 shows that ( i ) the spectral function is the most relevant quantity for studying the true nature of @xmath0 , and ( ii ) the spectral function of @xmath0 has a characteristic enhancement at the 2@xmath30 threshold near @xmath10 @xcite . in fig.3 , shown are the spectral functions @xmath40 in the @xmath30 ( @xmath0)-channel at finite @xmath4 calculated in the @xmath41 linear @xmath0 model : two characteristic features are the broadening of the pion peak ( fig.3(a ) ) and the spectral concentration at the 2@xmath30 threshold ( @xmath42 ) in the @xmath0-channel ( fig.3(b ) ) .",
    "the latter may be measured by the @xmath43 spectrum from the hot plasma created in the relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "channel ( a ) and in the @xmath0 channel ( b ) for @xmath4=50 , 120 , and 145 mev .",

    "the near - threshold enhancement discussed in sec.3 has been also studied at finite baryon density @xcite . because of the decrease of the chiral condensate discussed above , the spectral function in the @xmath0-channel , @xmath54 , has a following generic behavior at densities not far from @xmath55 ; @xmath56 which shows a spectral concentration at the @xmath57 threshold .",

    "recently chaos collaboration @xcite reported the data on the @xmath61 invariant mass distribution @xmath62 in the reaction @xmath63 with the mass number @xmath64 ranging from 2 to 208 : they observed that the yield for @xmath65 near the 2@xmath30 threshold is close to zero for @xmath66 , but increases dramatically with increasing @xmath64 .",
    "they identified that the @xmath67 pairs in this range of @xmath65 is in the @xmath27=@xmath58=@xmath12 state .",
    "this experiment was originally motivated by a possibility of strong @xmath68 correlations in nuclear matter @xcite . however , the state - of - the - art calculations using the nonlinear chiral lagrangian together with @xmath69 many - body dynamics do not reproduce the cross sections in the @xmath27=@xmath12 and @xmath27=@xmath70 channels simultaneously @xcite ; the final state interactions of the emitted two pions in nuclei give rise to a slight enhancement of the cross section in the @xmath27=@xmath12 channel , but is not sufficient to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "this indicates that an additional mechanism such as the partial restoration of chiral symmetry may be relevant for explaining the data @xcite .    to make a close connection between the idea of the spectral enhancement and the chaos data ,",
    "the in - medium @xmath30-@xmath30 cross section has been calculated in the linear and non - linear @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in both cases , substantial enhancement of the @xmath30-@xmath30 correlation in the @xmath27=@xmath58=@xmath12 channel near the threshold can be seen due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .",

    "the in - medium @xmath30-@xmath30 cross section in the @xmath0-channel calculated in the o(4 ) linear @xmath0 model is shown .",
    "theoretically , it is of great importance to make an extensive analysis of the @xmath30-@xmath30 interaction in heavy nuclei with the effect of partial chiral restoration to understand the chaos data .",
    "experimentally , it is definitely necessary to confirm the chaos result not only in the same reaction but also in other reactions .",
    "measuring @xmath72 is one of the clean experiments , since it is free from the @xmath73 meson background inherent in the @xmath74 measurement .",
    "measuring @xmath75 is interesting because of the small final state interactions .",
    "dilepton detection through the scalar - vector mixing in matter , @xmath76 and the formation of the @xmath0 mesic nuclei through the nuclear reactions such as ( d , t ) are other possible experiments @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd simulations have remarkable progress in recent years for calculating the properties of hadrons as well as the properties of qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "in particular , masses of light mesons and baryons in the quenched qcd simulation agree within 5 - 10 % with the experimental spectra @xcite . however , the lattice qcd had difficulties in accessing the dynamical quantities in the minkowski space , because measurements on the lattice can only be carried out for discrete points in imaginary time .",
    "the analytic continuation from the imaginary time to the real time using the noisy lattice data is highly non - trivial and is even classified as an ill - posed problem .",
    "recently a new approach to extract spectral functions of hadrons from lattice qcd data by using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) was started @xcite .",
    "mem has been successfully applied for similar problems in image reconstruction in crystallography and astrophysics , and in quantum monte carlo simulations in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "there are three important aspects of mem : ( i ) it does not require a priori assumptions or parametrizations of spfs , ( ii ) for given data , a unique solution is obtained if it exists , and ( iii ) the statistical significance of the solution can be quantitatively analyzed .",
