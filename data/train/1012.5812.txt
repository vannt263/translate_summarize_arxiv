    "the concept of a singular point of a tropical variety is not well established yet .",
    "a natural definition is the following .",
    "let @xmath0 be an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath1 with a valuation @xmath2 .",
    "we say that a point @xmath3 in a tropical variety @xmath4 is singular if there exists a singular algebraic subvariety of the torus @xmath5 , with tropicalization @xmath6 , with a singular point of valuation @xmath3 ( see definition  [ def : tropical_singularity ] ) . this definition of singularity in terms of the tropicalization of classical algebraic varieties has been considered in  @xcite in the case @xmath7 of planar curves , and indirectly in  @xcite and  @xcite , in the general hypersurface case .",
    "thus , in principle , one should study all the _ preimages _ of @xmath6 under the valuation map to decide whether @xmath6 is singular .",
    "we present an equivalent formulation when @xmath6 is a hypersurface defined by a tropical polynomial with prescribed support @xmath8 and the residue field of @xmath0 has also characteristic @xmath1 ( but our approach can be extended if this hypothesis is relaxed ) .",
    "recall that given a finite set @xmath9 , gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky @xcite defined and studied the main properties of the @xmath8-discriminant @xmath10 associated to the family of hypersurfaces with support @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the variety of laurent polynomials @xmath12 with coefficients in @xmath13 and support in @xmath8 which define a singular hypersurface @xmath14 in the torus @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath11 has codimension one , then there exists a unique ( up to sign ) polynomial @xmath16 $ ] such that if @xmath17 has a singular point in @xmath15 then @xmath18 .",
    "this polynomial is called the _ @xmath8-discriminant _ and",
    "its locus coincides with the dual variety @xmath19 of the equivariantly embedded toric variety @xmath20 rationally parametrized by the monomials with exponents in @xmath8 .",
    "if codim@xmath21 ( in which case @xmath20 is said to be _ defective _ ) , the polynomial @xmath10 is defined to be the constant polynomial @xmath22 , and we call in this case @xmath8-discriminant the ideal of @xmath19 . the varieties @xmath20 and @xmath19 , as well as the @xmath8-discriminant , are affine invariants of the configuration @xmath8 .",
    "a tropical polynomial @xmath23 with coefficients in @xmath24 defines a singular tropical hypersurface precisely when its vector of coefficients @xmath25 lies in the tropicalization @xmath26 of the @xmath8-discriminant .",
    "the concept of singularities of tropical varieties , as well as the concept of tropical tangency , can thus be addressed via the tropicalization of the @xmath8-discriminant described in  @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath27 the integer matrix with columns @xmath28",
    ". theorem  1.1 in @xcite states that the tropical discriminant equals the minkowski sum of the co - bergman fan @xmath29 and the row space of the matrix @xmath30 .",
    "the co - bergman fan @xmath31 is the tropicalization of the kernel of @xmath30 , or equivalently , the tropicalization of the space of affine relations among the vectors @xmath32 . following the notations in section  [ sec : euler_derivatives ] ( cf . also the discussion in section  [ sec : bergman ] ) , we can give an equivalent appealing definition of singular point of the tropical hypersurface defined by @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the linear form with all coefficients equal to @xmath22 , and denote by @xmath35 the tropical hypersurface @xmath36 consisting of those vectors @xmath37 for which the minimum of the coordinates of @xmath38 is attained at least twice",
    ". clearly , @xmath39 .",
    "we then have @xmath40 and the singularities @xmath41 are described by @xmath42    deciding whether a given tropical polynomial defines a singular tropical hypersurface , amounts with this approach to finding a way of writing its vector of coefficients @xmath25 as the sum of an element in @xmath31 plus an element in the rowspan of @xmath30 .",
    "this is particularly involved when @xmath20 is defective , and there was no algorithm known in the general case ( cf .",
    "@xcite , where an algorithm is presented under some geometric assumptions , or the arguments in the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3.12 ) ) .    instead , we give in theorem  [ teo : singular_point_by_derivatives ] a direct characterization of tropical singular points in terms of analogs of euler derivatives of tropical polynomials , which allows us to recover theorem  1.1 in  @xcite .",
    "our tropical approach translates into an algorithm to decide whether the tropical variety associated to @xmath43 is singular and to detect all the singular points .",
    "note that , given a laurent polynomial @xmath44 , if the vector of valuations @xmath45 defines a non singular tropical hypersurface , we get a `` certificate '' that @xmath12 defines a non singular hypersurface in the torus @xmath46 .",
    "however , it is not possible to find a simple combinatorial formula to describe all singular points because the situation is not , as one could expect , completely local ( cf .",
    "proposition  [ prop : anotherpt ] , and the concept of @xmath47-equivalence by gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky ) .",
    "we give several combinatorial conditions which characterize singular tropical hypersurfaces .    in @xcite or @xcite ,",
    "tropical smooth curves are defined in terms of coherent subdivisions where all points in @xmath8 are marked , and which define primitive triangulations of the convex hull @xmath48 of @xmath8 ( cf . also the concept of singular tropical curves of maximal dimensional type in @xcite ) . if the dual subdivision of @xmath48 induced by a tropical curve @xmath49",
    "is a primitive triangulation , @xmath49 will always be a smooth curve in our sense too .",
    "but our definition allows for certain non primitive triangulations which correspond to smooth tropical hypersurfaces , that is , tropical hypersurfaces that can not be the tropicalization of an algebraic hypersurface with a singularity in the algebraic torus @xmath50 ( see examples  [ ex : triang2 ] ,  [ ex : nontriang2 ] and proposition  [ teo : singular_dim_1_and_2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath8 does not admit a unimodular triangulation or if not all the lattice points in the convex hull of @xmath8 are marked , we can have smooth points at facets where the weight ( as it is currently defined , see @xcite ) is @xmath51 .",
    "note that we concentrate on _ affine _ singular points , that is points in the `` torus '' @xmath24 of the tropical semifield .",
    "our study includes all coherent subdivisions of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we refine the definition in @xcite and we explore the whole @xmath8-discriminant .",
    "our method also generalizes trivially to hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimension . in the last section ,",
    "we apply our tools to define and study the non - transversal intersections of two tropical curves with fixed monomial support , that is , the tropicalization of mixed discriminants of bivariate polynomials .",
    "we fix throughout the text a finite lattice set @xmath8 in @xmath52 of cardinality @xmath53 .",
    "we will assume without loss of generality that the @xmath54-linear span of @xmath8 equals @xmath52 .",
