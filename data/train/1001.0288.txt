    "the thermodynamical property of spacetime is an important hint for the quantization of gravity . starting from hawking s discovery of black hole",
    "s radiation @xcite , a theory of thermodynamics of spacetime is being constructed gradually .",
    "recently , the second law of this thermodynamics was generalized to the covariant entropy bound conjecture @xcite .",
    "it states that the entropy flux @xmath0 through any null hypersurface generated by geodesics with non - positive expansion , emanating orthogonally from a two - dimensional ( 2d ) spacelike surface of area @xmath1 , must satisfy @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the planck length .",
    "here and in what follows , we adopt the units @xmath4 .",
    "soon , flanagan , marolf and wald @xcite proposed a new version of the entropy bound conjecture .",
    "if one allows the geodesics generating the null hypersurface from a 2d spacelike surface of area @xmath1 to terminate at another 2d spacelike surface of area @xmath5 before coming to a caustic , boundary or singularity of spacetime , one can replace the above conjecture with @xmath6 more recently , he and zhang related these conjectures to dynamical horizon and proposed a covariant entropy bound conjecture on the cosmological dynamical horizon @xcite : let @xmath7 be the area of the cosmological dynamical horizon at cosmological time @xmath8 , then the entropy flux @xmath0 through the cosmological dynamical horizon between time @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) must satisfy @xmath11 if the dominant energy condition holds for matter .    as a non - perturbative and background - independent quantization of gravity , the loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) developed rapidly in recent years .",
    "its cosmological version , the loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) achieved many successes , including resolution of the classical singularity @xcite , quantum suppression of classical chaotic behavior near singularities @xcite , generic phase of inflation @xcite and more ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "since it has been suggested that the holographic principle is a powerful hint and should be used as an essential building block for any quantum gravity theory @xcite , it is important and tempting to investigate the covariant entropy bound conjecture in the framework of the lqc , which is a successful application of the non - perturbative quantum gravity scheme  the lqg .",
    "the authors of @xcite investigated the bousso s covariant entropy bound @xcite with a cosmology filled with photon gas and found that the conjecture is violated near the big bang in the classical scenario .",
    "but they found the lqc can protect this conjecture even in the deep quantum region . in @xcite , he and zhang proposed a new version of the entropy bound conjecture for the dynamical horizon in cosmology and validated it through a cosmology filled with adiabatic perfect fluid , governed by the classical einstein equation when the universe is far away from the big bang singularity .",
    "but when the universe approaches the big bang singularity , the strong quantum fluctuation does break down their conjecture .",
    "in analogy to ashtekar and wilson - ewing s result @xcite , one may wonder if he and zhang s conjecture can also be protected by the quantum geometry effect of the lqg .    following @xcite , we use photon gas as an example to investigate this problem . as expected , we find that the loop quantum effects can indeed protect the conjecture .",
    "besides the result of @xcite , our result presents one more evidence for the consistence between the loop gravity and the covariant entropy conjecture .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] , we briefly review the framework of the effective lqc and describe the covariant entropy bound conjecture proposed by he and zhang @xcite . then in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] , we test this conjecture with cosmology filled with photon gas , and show that the lqc is able to protect the conjecture in all .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] and discuss the implications .",
    "to a good degree of approximation , the universe can be described by the well - known friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , @xmath12 which describes a homogeneous and isotropic universe . here the spatial curvature @xmath13 correspond to open , flat and closed universes respectively , and @xmath14 is the scale factor of the universe . for simplicity",
    "we focus on a flat universe in this paper . in the lqc ,",
    "the phase space for a flat universe is spanned by the coordinates @xmath15 , being the gravitational gauge connection , and @xmath16 , being the densitized triad .",
    "@xmath17 is the barbero - immirzi parameter @xcite .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian in the lqc is given by @xcite @xmath18 the variable @xmath19 corresponds to the dimensionless length of the edge of the elementary loop and is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on the particular scheme in the holonomy corrections . in this paper",
    "we take the @xmath19-scheme , which gives @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with this effective hamiltonian",
    ", we have the canonical equation @xmath25 or , @xmath26 combining with the constraint on the hamiltonian , @xmath27 , we obtain the modified friedmann equation , @xmath28 in terms of the hubble rate @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the critical energy density coming from the quantum effect in the lqc .",
    "it is a large quantity and when it goes to infinity all the quantum effects disappear .",
    "according to @xcite , the cosmological dynamical horizon @xcite is defined geometrically as a three - dimensional hypersurface foliated by spheres , where at least one orthogonal null congruence with vanishing expansion exists . for a sphere characterized by any value of @xmath33 , there are two future directed null directions @xmath34 satisfying geodesic equation @xmath35 .",
    "the expansion of these null directions is @xmath36 where the dot denotes differential with respect to @xmath8 , and the sign @xmath37 represents the null direction pointing to larger ( smaller ) values of @xmath38 . for an expanding universe ,",
    "i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 determines the location of the dynamical horizon , @xmath41 , by the definition of dynamical horizon given above .",
    "the lqc replaces the big bang with the big bounce , so the universe is symmetric with respect to the point of the bounce , expanding on one side of the bounce and contracting on the other side .",
    "the dynamical horizon in the contracting stage of the lqc corresponds to @xmath42 , and all of the relations are similar to the ones given here . in this paper",
    "we only consider the expanding stage for the lqc , but note that the contracting stage is the same .",
    "since the area of the dynamical horizon is @xmath43 , the covariant entropy bound conjecture in our question becomes @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the entropy flux through the dynamical horizon between cosmological time @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath45 is the hubble parameter . considering that the cosmology model discussed here is isotropic and homogeneous",
    ", we can write the entropy current vector as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ordinary comoving entropy density , independent of space .",
    "if the entropy current of the perfect fluid is conserved , i.e. , @xmath48 , @xmath47 will be independent of @xmath8 as well .",
    "for simplicity we restrict ourselves to this special case . the entropy flux through the dynamical horizon ( shown in fig.[fig1 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the spacetime volume 4-form .",
    "so the conjecture is reduced to @xmath51     and @xmath9 respectively .",

    "plugging above thermodynamics relation into equation ( [ entropydensity ] ) we get @xmath64 . written the above conservation equation as @xmath65 we have an integration constant @xmath66 . then @xmath67 . combining our equation of state eq .",
