    "topological superconductors ( scs ) have been intensively studied due to their fundamental interest in the physical realization of majorana fermions  @xcite and their future application to topological quantum computation  @xcite . a typical design principle for two - dimensional time - reversal broken topological scs is to realize a spinless chiral @xmath1-wave sc  @xcite .",
    "possible candidates are the surface of a topological insulator  @xcite and a quantum anomalous hall insulator in proximity to @xmath0-wave scs  @xcite .",
    "more promising candidates are conventional spin - orbit coupled systems with the zeeman interaction and the @xmath0-wave pairing potential  @xcite .",
    "in fact , their one - dimensional analog was theoretically proposed  @xcite and later experimentally realized in semiconductor nanowires contacted with @xmath0-wave scs  @xcite .    in a chiral @xmath1-wave sc",
    ", each cooper pair carries the orbital angular momentum ( am ) @xmath6 , which leads to the chern number @xmath7 and the bulk orbital am @xmath8 at zero temperature  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is the total number of electrons , and we set @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath2 is known to deviate from @xmath10 due to retroreflection by edge roughness  @xcite and the opposite chirality with the vorticity @xmath11 induced around the edge  @xcite .",
    "however , these effects do not occur without the edge , disorder , or a vortex , and it is natural to call @xmath8 the intrinsic value in chiral @xmath1-wave scs . in higher - order chiral scs with @xmath12 , the chern number and the bulk orbital am are equal to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively  @xcite . although it was recently found that the bulk orbital am is totally suppressed due to the edge states without the particle - hole symmetry by themselves  @xcite , still we can call @xmath14 the intrinsic value in chiral scs .",
    "thus , the chern number and the bulk orbital am appear not to be independent of each other .    generally speaking , topological invariants are robust against symmetry - preserving perturbations which do not close the gap , while the orbital am is not conserved in the presence of spin - orbit interactions ( sois ) . in the specific model with the rashba soi @xmath15 ,",
    "the zeeman interaction @xmath16 , and the @xmath0-wave pairing potential @xmath17  @xcite , which is dubbed the rashba+zeeman+@xmath0-wave model below , the rashba soi neither closes the gap nor changes the chern number .",
    "one question is whether the chern number and the bulk orbital am are not independent even in the presence of sois . if not , a subsequent question is what the bulk orbital am characterizes in topological scs .",
    "one possible answer to the second question is the impurity effects .",
    "in contrast to the chern number which characterizes a topological sc , the bulk orbital am may characterize how close it is to a spinless chiral sc with the same chern number and how fragile it is to nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "topological scs are not always robust against nonmagnetic impurities , namely , the midgap bound states appear and the critical temperature @xmath18 is suppressed  @xcite .",
    "these impurity effects in the rashba+zeeman+@xmath0-wave model depend on @xmath16 and are similar to those in a chiral @xmath1-wave sc for large @xmath16 .",
    "there is another evidence that the bulk orbital am is related to the robustness against nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "the impurity effects on the bound state in a single vortex core were investigated in the rashba+zeeman+@xmath0-wave model  @xcite .",
    "there are two types of vortices : a parallel ( antiparallel ) vortex when the signs of the vorticity and the zeeman interaction are opposite ( same ) .",
    "note that our sign convention of the zeeman interaction is opposite to that in ref .  .",
    "the authors found that the low - energy scattering rate is suppressed in the case of an antiparallel vortex compared to the case of a parallel vortex , and that the robustness of the bound state against nonmagnetic impurities depends on the rashba soi .",
    "thus , the impurity effects may be characterized by the bulk orbital am rather than the chern number .    in this paper , we investigate the bulk orbital am in a two - dimensional time - reversal broken topological sc .",
    "we focus on the rashba+zeeman+@xmath0-wave model  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the bulk orbital am both by the berry - phase formula  @xcite and in the circular disk .",
    "one advantage of the berry - phase formula is that the wave functions in the reciprocal space are simpler compared to those in the real space .",
    "we explain the effects of nonmagnetic impurities in the absence  @xcite and presence  @xcite of a vortex .",
    "the rashba+zeeman+@xmath0-wave model  @xcite is represented by @xmath19 \\psi_{\\vec k } , \\label{eq : razesc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20^{\\rm t}$ ] is the nambu spinor , and @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s are the pauli matrices for the spin and nambu spaces , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the kinetic term in reference to the chemical potential @xmath24 .",
    "there are four dispersions , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the gap between @xmath27 closes at @xmath28 for @xmath29 , above which this model has the nontrivial chern number @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "it can be easily understood by representing eq .   in the band basis  @xcite . in fig .",

    "@xmath50 are the normalization constants , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are real functions of @xmath53 only . in the polar coordinate ,",
    "the berry curvature for the wave function @xmath54 is defined by @xmath55 , and the integrand for the bulk orbital am is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the berry connection  @xcite . since the berry connection can be interpreted as the expectation value of the position operator @xmath58 in the reciprocal space , the integrand is interpreted as that of @xmath59 . the chern number @xmath60 , the total number of electrons @xmath5 , the total spin @xmath61 , and the bulk orbital am @xmath4 are calculated by    @xmath62 , \\label{eq : razescc } \\\\",

    "note that the total number of electrons @xmath5 as well as the bulk orbital am @xmath4 changes by changing @xmath15 or @xmath16 with @xmath24 being fixed .",
    "nonetheless , the bulk orbital am per electron @xmath2 plays an important role when we discuss the impurity effects below .    the bulk orbital am can be calculated not only in the reciprocal space but in the real space .",
    "we consider the circular disk with the radius @xmath63 .",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations in the real space are given as @xmath64    \\begin{bmatrix }     { \\bm u}({\\bm r } ) \\\\",

    "since the upper band goes away from the chemical potential , we obtain @xmath114 and @xmath115 . however , it is not correct to expect @xmath116 just because the pairing potential is @xmath33 wave . in the presence of the rashba soi ,",

    "here we discuss the effects of nonmagnetic impurities in time - reversal - broken topological scs . in the topological phase , a strong nonmagnetic impurity behaves like a vortex core , which gives rise to the midgap bound state  @xcite .",

    "the ratio @xmath127 monotonically decreases as @xmath16 increases  @xcite , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 represent the energy level of the bound state and the energy gap , respectively .",
    "this nonuniversal impurity effect can be characterized by the nonuniversal bulk orbital am .    to check this conjecture",
    ", we introduce a single impurity potential @xmath130 at the center of the circular disk and solve the bdg equations . here",
    "@xmath131 is the step function , and we set the radius of the impurity potential @xmath132 and the strength @xmath133 .",

    "we can clearly see the midgap bound state in addition to the edge state @xmath137 for @xmath40 .",
    "since the impurity strength is sufficiently large , this bound state is what is called the `` universal midgap bound state '' in ref .",
    "apparently , the obtained midgap bound state is not universal .",
    "the `` universal midgap bound state '' @xmath138 in a topological sc  @xcite relied on the edge state @xmath139 in a chiral @xmath1-wave sc  @xcite .",

    "although we assume the uniform pairing potential and do not solve the bdg equations self - consistently , we find that the energy level of this bound state @xmath127 and the bulk orbital am @xmath142 are well correlated as seen in figs  [ fig : bound](c , d ) . a self - consistent calculation may improve this correlation but is a future issue .        with the appearance of the midgap bound states ,",
    "the reduction of the critical temperature @xmath18 also becomes relevant  @xcite .",
    "this crossover of the robustness against nonmagnetic impurities is consistent with the crossover of the bulk orbital am we have found .",
    "moreover , we expect that the rashba soi makes the topological sc robust because it suppresses the bulk orbital am .",
    "we can also explain the vorticity - dependent impurity effects on the vortex bound state  @xcite . as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the bound state in an antiparallel vortex is more robust against nonmagnetic impurities than that in a parallel vortex . furthermore , the low - energy scattering rate in the case of an antiparallel vortex is suppressed for small @xmath15 as in chiral @xmath1-wave scs , while it is similar to that in the case of a parallel vortex for large @xmath15 as in @xmath0-wave scs . the orbital am carried by the antiparallel vortex is almost canceled by the intrinsic orbital am for small @xmath15 , but not for large @xmath15 . for sufficiently large @xmath15 ,",
    "the intrinsic orbital am is totally suppressed , and two types of vortices can not be distinguished .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the impurity effects are characterized not by the integer chern number but by the nonuniversal bulk orbital am .",
    "although it may be difficult to measure the bulk orbital am directly , there are two alternatives .",
    "one is the hall viscosity , which is equal to half the bulk orbital am in two - dimensional gapped systems at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the other is the spin magnetization , whose absolute value is equal to that of the bulk orbital am but sign is opposite as discussed above .",
    "especially , in fig .",
    "[ fig : am1 ] , the slope of @xmath87 at @xmath143 is nothing but the spin susceptibility @xmath144 . in the presence of the soi ,",
    "@xmath145 is nonzero due to the interband van vleck spin susceptibility .",
    "this is an indirect but simple way to measure the bulk orbital am .",
    "to summarize , we have calculated the bulk orbital am in the two - dimensional rashba+zeeman+@xmath0-wave topological sc .",
    "the berry - phase formula coincides with numerical calculations in the circular disk .",
    "prior to the topological phase transition at @xmath146 , we have found the crossover from @xmath0 wave to @xmath1 wave at @xmath147 , where @xmath2 starts to increase negatively .",
    "we have also found that the rashba soi tends to suppress @xmath87 and @xmath2 because the bulk total am always vanishes . for large @xmath15 , even in the topological phase , @xmath2 does not reach @xmath3 , which is the intrinsic value in chiral @xmath1-wave scs . we have explained the impurity effects on the topological sc : the appearance of the midgap bound states  @xcite , the reduction of the critical temperature  @xcite , and the vorticity dependence of the vortex bound state  @xcite .",
