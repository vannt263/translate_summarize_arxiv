    "observational breakthroughs led by the _ swift _ mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) suggest that at least some short grbs are associated with nearby host galaxies with little star formation ( tanvir et al .",

    "2006 ; zhang et al .",

    "kann et al ( 2010 , 2008 ) systematically studied the optical afterglow emission properties of type ii and type i grbs , and suggested that these properties carry important information about the nature of grb progenitors . a full definition of type i / ii grbs as well as the multiple observational criteria are presented in zhang et al .",
    "( 3 ) two high - redshift gamma - ray bursts , grb 080913 at @xmath15 ( greiner et al . 2009 ; perez - ramirez et al . 2010 ) and grb 090423 at @xmath16 ( tanvir et al .",
    "2009 ; salvaterra et al .",

    "their observed durations are @xmath17s and @xmath18s in the _ swift / bat _ band , respectively .",

    "although compact star mergers may occur at such a high redshift ( belczynski et al .",
    "2010 ) , various observational properties of these two grbs point towards the massive star origin ( zhang et al . 2009",
    "; lin et al . 2009 ; belczynki et al . 2010 ) . ( 4 ) a more striking case is grb 090426 , whose observed bat band @xmath9 is only @xmath19s , and the rest frame duration is only @xmath20 0.33 s at @xmath21 ( levesque et al .",
    "it greatly exceeds the previous short grb redshift record , i.e. @xmath22 for grb 070714b ( graham et al .",
    "phenomenologically , this is an unambiguous short - duration grb , but the available afterglow and host galaxy properties point towards a different picture : it has a blue , very luminous , star - forming putative host galaxy with a small angular offset of the afterglow location from the center , and a similar medium density as typical type ii grbs .",
    "all these suggest that the burst is more closely related to the core collapse of a massive star ( levesque et al .",
    "2009 ; antonelli et al . 2009 ; xin et al .",
    "( 5 ) monte carlo simulations suggest that the compact star merger model can not interpret both the _ swift _ @xmath7-known short grb sample and the batse short grb sample .",
    "instead one may need a mix of grbs from compact star mergers and from massive star core collapses to account for the observed short grb population ( virgili et al .",
    "2009 ; cui et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the traditional long _ vs. _ short grb scheme no longer always correspondingly match the two distinct physical origins , i.e. , collapse of massive stars ( type ii grbs ) _ vs. _ mergers of compact stars ( type i grbs ) ( zhang 2006 ; zhang et al . 2007 , 2009 ; bloom et al . 2008 ) .",
    "zhang et al ( 2009 ) proposed a procedure ( a flow chart , see their fig.8 ) invoking a full set of observational characteristics , including supernova(sn)-grb association , specific star - forming rate ( sfr ) of the host galaxy , burst location offset , burst duration , hardness , spectral lag , statistical correlations , energetics , and afterglow properties , to judge the physical category of a grb . on the other hand , for most grbs one may not immediately retrieve all the information needed for such a classification .",
    "it would be interesting to search for additional phenomenological classification schemes to see whether there exist other quantities , especially those invoking prompt grb emission properties only , that can give a good indication of the physical nature of a grb .",
    "this motivates us to explore a new phenomenological classification method .",
    "besides the burst duration , we think both the burst energy and the spectral properties in the burst rest frame would carry important information about the nature of the burst . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new discriminator based on the isotropic burst energy and rest frame peak energy ( @xmath23 ) of the @xmath24 spectrum of the prompt gamma - rays .",
    "we will show that this classification method is more closely connected to the type ii / i physical classification scheme .",
    "in order to develop our classification method , we use a sample of all grbs with both redshift and spectral parameters known up to mar , 2010 .",
    "our sample includes 137 grbs .",

    "their isotropic gamma - ray energy ( @xmath25 ) is calculated in the grb rest - frame @xmath26 kev band with the spectral parameters in order to avoid instrument selection effect .",
    "the soft xrf 080109 ( soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) , whose emission is in the xrt band ( 0.3 - 10kev ) instead of bat band , is also included in our sample .",
    "the xrt and uvot observations place a limit of its @xmath4 in the range @xmath27 .",
    "we adopt @xmath28 kev ( li 2008 ) .",
    "eight bursts in our sample ( grbs 050709 , 050724 , 051210 , 060614 , 061006 , 061210 , 070714b , and 071227 ) are the so - called short grbs with  extended emission \" discussed in literature . for these grbs ,",
    "both parameters ( @xmath25 and @xmath29 ) are derived for the initial hard spike only ( extended emission excluded ) depends on the detector s sensitivity and energy band . in our analysis , we define @xmath9 using the bat energy band and sensitivity . in the _ swift _ era , it is found that some  short \" grbs ( as observed in the batse band ) have extended emission .",
    "it is the convention of the _ swift _ team and the community to define a  short \" grb based on the duration of the short spike only , with the extended emission excluded .",
    "observationally , the spectrum of the short spike is much harder than that of the extended emission , the latter shares many properties with x - ray flares . for a same burst ,",
    "the  extended emission \" depends on redshift , since it may be buried within the background if the redshift is high enough .",
    "we therefore only use the information of the short / hard spike to perform our classification . ] .",
    "we tabulate only those grbs with @xmath30 s ( twenty - nine grbs ) in our sample in table 1 .",
    "firstly , we show the distribution of @xmath31 in fig .",
    "similar to that shown in lin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , @xmath31 for the current grb sample with redshift measurements has a tentative bimodal distribution , with peaks at @xmath32 and 1.25 , respectively . due to the overlap between the two classes ( long vs. short )",
    ", those grbs having @xmath33 seconds can not be unambiguously categorized into either group seconds may be an intermediate population based on the excess of the grbs over the bimodal distribution of @xmath31 .",
    "although these grbs are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than typical long grbs , they share many similar properties of typical grbs , such as spectral lag and spectrum - energy correlations .",
    "they may be a sub - group of the long grbs ( de ugarte postigo 2010 ) . ] .",
    "we test the bimodality with the kmm algorithm presented by ashman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and obtain a chance probability @xmath34 .",
    "the correct allocation rate for short grbs estimated with the kmm algorithm is @xmath35 .",
    "we develop our classification method by defining a parameter , @xmath36 where @xmath37 ergs and @xmath38 kev .",
    "note that @xmath5 does not depend on any spectrum - energy correlation or theoretical assumption .",
    "we explore various @xmath39 values , and found that given a same observed grb ( known fluence and @xmath4 ) the implicit @xmath7-dependence of @xmath40 essentially vanishes at @xmath41 , if @xmath42 ( see fig . 2 for a comparison of the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath5 for different @xmath39 ) .",
    "we therefore define @xmath43 which removes the redshift dependence for high-@xmath7 grbs",
    ". this parameter may be more suitable for the classification of high-@xmath7 grbs , such as grbs 090423 and 080913 .",
    "we calculate @xmath5 for the bursts in our sample and show the @xmath44 distribution in fig.1 ( b ) .",
    "a clear bimodal feature is found , with a division line at @xmath45 ( high-@xmath5 vs. low-@xmath5 ) .",
    "the high-@xmath5 portion follows a log normal distribution with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . for the low-@xmath5 it is @xmath48 .",
    "we test the bimodality of the @xmath5 distribution with the kmm algorithm and obtain a chance probability @xmath49 . the overall correct allocation rate of grbs in the two categories ( high-@xmath5 vs. low-@xmath5 ) is as high as 99.8% , indicating that @xmath5 is a new parameter for grb classification .",
    "it is generally believed that grbs originate either from core collapses of massive stars ( type ii ) or mergers of compact stars ( type i ) .",
    "one may ask whether this phenomenal classification matches the physical scheme of the type i and type ii .",
    "the origins of most grbs in our sample have been extensively discussed in literature ( zhang et al .",
    "2009 ; kann et al .",
    "2010 , 2008 ) .",
    "we therefore examine how the members in our two new categories ( high-@xmath5 vs. low-@xmath5 ) are associated with the two physical model types . to define the physical category of the grbs",
    ", we apply the flow chart of zhang et al .",
    "( 2009 , their fig.8 ) .",
    "we denote all  type ii \" or  type ii candidates \" as  type ii \" , and  type i \" or  type i candidates \" as  type i \" ( which include the type i gold sample and most other short / hard grbs in zhang et al .",
    "we note that these definitions are fully consistent with those adopted in kann et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2008 ) .",
    "1 displays all the grbs in our sample in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "different symbols are used to mark different groups .",
    "for example , triangles denote the grbs that are believed to be of the type ii origin , among which the black triangles denote the traditional long grbs , and the blue triangles denote the grbs those with @xmath31 s shorter than 2 s. the red circles denote those grbs that are believed to have the type i origin .",
    "six green stars denote nearby low luminosity grbs with supernova associations .",
    "it is remarkable to see that the @xmath5 classification clearly separates type ii grbs from type i grbs .    in order to quantitatively",
    "assess the clustering feature among different types of grbs , we derive the grb distribution probability @xmath51 from the ratio between the number of grbs in the grid @xmath52 and the total number of grbs in our sample .",
    "since the distribution of @xmath5 is concerned in our analysis , we take the error of @xmath53 into account in our calculation of @xmath54 . for a given grb with @xmath55",
    ", we assume that the probability distribution of this grb is a normalized log - normal distribution centering at @xmath53 with a width of @xmath56 .",
    "the probability ( @xmath57 ) of the grb in a given rage [ @xmath58/2 , @xmath59/2 ] is calculated by integrating the probability distribution function in the range .",
    "the probability @xmath60 is then obtained by summing up @xmath57 over the grbs in our sample .",
    "we take @xmath61 and @xmath62 in our calculation .",
    "the contours of the probability distribution are shown in fig .",
    "one can clearly identify two clustering regions [ with @xmath63 centered in the high-@xmath5 regime and the low-@xmath5 , low-@xmath31 regime . at the @xmath8 level ,",
    "the high-@xmath5 group includes typical long grbs with high - luminosity , some intrinsic short duration grbs ( including the high-@xmath7 grb 090423 and grb 080913 ) , as well as some high-@xmath7 short grbs ( e.g. grb 090426 ) .",
    "in contrast , the low-@xmath5 group contains the extensively discussed type i grbs , including those with and without extended emission .",
    "based on the probability contours , a low-@xmath5 grb with @xmath10 s in the _",
    "swift_/bat band would be identified as a type i grb at the @xmath8 confidence level .",
    "grbs 060614 and 060505 are marginally included in the @xmath64 region ( the light grey region in fig .",
    "1c ) of the type i grbs .",
    "nearby low luminosity long grbs ( ll - grbs ) , e.g. grbs 980425 , 031203 , 050826 , and 060218 ( green stars in fig .",
    "1c ) are out of the 3 @xmath65 contours of the type i and type ii grbs .",
    "this may hint a distinct grb population as suggested by liang et al .",
    "( 2007 ; see also soderberg et al .",
    "2004 ; cobb et al .",
    "by introducing a new parameter @xmath5 , we have proposed a new phenomenological classification method for grbs .",
    "we demonstrated that grbs with known redshifts are cozily classified into two classes with a separation @xmath66 . due to the clear bimodal distribution of @xmath5 with little overlap ,",
    "the overall correct allocation rate of a grb to a particular category ( high-@xmath5 vs. low-@xmath5 ) is as high as @xmath67 , which is much better than the traditional duration classification method .",
    "more importantly , this classification scheme is more closely related to the two physically motivated model classes - type ii vs. i. in particular , the high-@xmath5 category is a good representation of the type ii grbs , while the low-@xmath5 category , with an additional duration criterion @xmath10 s , is a good representation of the type i grbs .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath5 parameter can be evaluated for future grbs with @xmath7 measurements , and the @xmath5-based classification may be performed regularly to infer the physical origin of a grb .",
    "the well - separated bimodal distribution of @xmath53 depends on our selection of @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath5 is insensitive to @xmath7 at @xmath41 for a given burst by taking @xmath42 , but it is not at low redshift .",
    "one may suspect that if the bimodal distribution is due to the redshift effect . to examine this issue ,",
    "we re - plot the figure 1 by separating grbs into the @xmath41 and the @xmath68 samples ( figure 3 , left and middle panels , respectively ) .",
    "we also show the grb distributions in the @xmath69 plane for all the bursts in our sample in figure 3 .",
    "it is found that the the clustering feature of @xmath53 is not caused by the redshift selection effect .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 is a grb discriminator for both grbs at @xmath68 and @xmath41 .",
    "another concern about our classification method may be sample uniformity .",
    "the grbs in our sample were detected with different instruments with different instrumental threshold .",
    "however , our classification method is based on the global energy and spectral information .",
    "different from the burst duration , a well - measured @xmath4 essentially does not depend on the detector .",
    "so is @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath4 values of the grbs in our sample , which expand almost four orders of magnitude , are well within the energy band of previous and current grb missions , so they are well measured .",
    "the @xmath71 values expand almost eight orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , our sample could be regarded as a complete sample with known @xmath4 and @xmath71 for current missions .",
    "we should note that our classification scheme is particularly helpful to diagnose the physical origin of grbs with a rest - frame short duration ( e.g. @xmath72 s , table 1 ) .",
    "for example , it convincingly classifies grbs 090423 , 080913 and 090426 into the high-@xmath5 , and therefore , the type ii category , which is otherwise difficult with the duration criterion at higher redshift may have a higher @xmath5 .",
    "however , the bimodal distribution may not be due to the redshift effect ( see figure 3 ) . ] .",
    "the distinction of the @xmath73 bursts with different @xmath5 values is also evident from their x - ray afterglow properties .",
    "kann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) compared the optical afterglows type i grbs with type ii grbs , and found that those of type i grbs have a lower average luminosity and show a larger intrinsic spread of luminosities . in figure 4",
    ", we compare the xrt lightcurves and the 12-hour x - ray luminosities between the two types of @xmath74 s grbs .",
    "the low-@xmath5 @xmath75 s grbs ( type i , red ) are systematically fainter than the high-@xmath5 ones ( type ii , blue ) type i grbs may have fainter x - ray afterglows and therefore may not be detected . ] , whose properties are rather similar to other high-@xmath5 long grbs ( black ) .    physically it is not obvious why the parameter @xmath5 ( corresponding to @xmath42 ) gives a cozy classification scheme .",
    "we have tried other @xmath39 values in eq.(1 ) , but the classifications defined by other @xmath76 are not as clean as the one defined by eq.(2 ) . as shown in figure 2 , an apparent advantage of @xmath42 is to diminish the @xmath7-dependence at high-@xmath7 for a given observed grb .",
    "one can also discuss the connection between the log - normal distribution of @xmath5 in the high-@xmath5 regime and some empirical relations of type ii grbs . with the amati - relation @xmath77 ( amati et al .",
    "2009 ) , we find that @xmath78 , insensitive to @xmath3 .",
    "liang & zhang ( 2005 ) discovered an empirical relation among @xmath1 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , namely , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the rest - frame break time of the optical afterglow lightcurve .",
    "this gives @xmath83 , which is sensitive to @xmath80 .",
    "a clustering in @xmath5 therefore corresponds to a clustering in @xmath80 .",
    "interpreting the @xmath80 as the jet break time , the liang - zhang relation may be translated into the ghirlanda - relation , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 ( ghirlanda et al . 2004 ; dai et al .",
    "2004 ) . given @xmath86",
    ", we can get @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the jet opening angle .",
    "the lognormal @xmath5 distribution ( @xmath89 , at @xmath47 ) therefore corresponds to a lognormal jet opening angle distribution for type ii grbs , i.e. , @xmath90 rad ( assuming @xmath91 ) .",
    "we note that the jet opening angle derived by ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indeed clusters in a small range .",
    "since the ghirlanda - relation is very difficult to understand physically , we suspect that it may be related the fact that @xmath5 is quasi - universal for type ii grbs .",
    "future data with very early or very late optical break times may test whether the ghirlanda / liang - zhang relations or the fact of a quasi - universal @xmath5 are more fundamental .",
