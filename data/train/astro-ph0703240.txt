    "the magnetic flare model is an attractive possibility to explain the x - ray properties of accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "it was originally suggested by @xcite and developed in several subsequent papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flares supposedly result from reconnection events in the magnetized corona of the accretion disk .",
    "they account for the heating of the corona to a very hot ( @xmath7@xmath8  k ) and optically thin medium .",
    "this medium explains the production of the observed primary x - ray spectrum by compton up - scattering of soft x - ray photons coming from the accretion disk .",
    "the flares may appear with different durations and intensities .",
    "the rapid fluctuations seen in x - ray lightcurves of agn can be explained by the random appearance of numerous `` weak '' flares distributed across an accretion disk .",
    "such a model is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it enables to constrain global parameters of agn by fitting their _ rms _ variability spectrum . but",
    "also `` strong '' ( very intense ) flares are occasionally seen in the x - ray lightcurves of some nearby seyfert galaxies ( mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , ponti et al .",
    "2004 ; ngc  5548 , kaastra et al .",
    "such flares can dominate the x - ray spectrum on time scales of thousands of seconds .",
    "we present spectral modeling over 230  kev of strong x - ray flares occurring above an agn accretion disk .",
    "we concentrate on the reprocessed component expected from the illuminated patch underneath the flare source .",
    "our radiative transfer simulations include computations of the vertical disk structure and modifications of the spectrum by general relativistic and doppler effects .",
    "we assume a compact flare source elevated to a height @xmath9 above the accretion disk and emitting a primary spectrum with @xmath10 .",
    "the primary source produces an irradiated , horizontally stratified hot spot on the disk ; the highest illuminating flux appears at the spot center and the lowest at the border .",
    "we solve the radiative transfer for five different concentric annuli of the hot spot using the codes titan and noar @xcite .",
    "the vertical structure of the accretion disk is computed with a new version of the code by @xcite .",
    "details of these calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the resulting local spectra are obtained at twenty different emission angles .",
    "these spectra are then used with the ray - tracing code ky @xcite that computes the spectral evolution seen by a distant observer .",
    "the code takes into account all effects of general relativity and the keplerian motion of the hot spot around the black hole .",
    "first , we investigate the observed spectrum of the spot at different orbital phases . the following parameters for the accreting black hole are set : mass @xmath11 , dimensionless spin @xmath12 , and accretion rate ( in units of the eddington accretion rate ) @xmath13 ; for the flare we set @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , and the spot radius @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the half - opening angle of the `` beaming cone '' . the thermal flux from the disk at the spot center , @xmath19 , is assumed to be much weaker than the flare irradiation @xmath20 .",
    "the local radiative transfer calculations are conducted for a spot at a disk radius of @xmath21 .",
    "when computing the distant spectra we neglect that the local spectra change for other disk radii  we thus only emphasize the relativistic effects .",
    "we assume that the hot spot exists for a quarter of an orbit and we analyze the resulting time - integrated spectrum at four different azimuthal phases .",
    "the viewing direction of the distant observer is inclined by @xmath22 with respect to the disk normal .     with respect to the disk normal .",
    "the bottom figure hence represents the orbital phase @xmath23 , when the spot is at the closest approach to the observer .",
    "the disk and the black hole rotate clockwise .",
    "the curves denote spots at different disk radii : 3  @xmath24 ( black ) , 10  @xmath24 ( red ) , and 40  @xmath24 ( green ) . ]",
    "we show the resulting spectra in fig .  [",
    "fig : fullspec ] .",
    "the reprocessing features we are particularly interested in are the compton hump and the iron k@xmath0 line complex . in the local frame of the disk , the compton hump",
    "is situated around 30  kev and the laboratory energy of the iron line ranges , depending on the ionization state , between 6.4 and 6.9  kev .",
    "the figure shows how the reprocessing features are shifted by gravitational energy shift and doppler effects .",
    "the gravitational shift depends only on @xmath25 while the doppler effect also changes with the azimuthal phase . as a result of these two effects ,",
    "the iron k@xmath0 line is smeared out and the smearing becomes stronger with decreasing @xmath25 . very close to the black hole , at @xmath26 ,",
    "the line is not recognizable any more .",
    "furthermore , the relative flux between the compton hump and the iron line maximum changes systematically and decreases with @xmath25 .",
    "the closer to the black hole the spectra originate , the flatter they appear .",
    "furthermore , light - bending effects and the frame dragging around the fast - spinning black hole are important .",
    "they induce an asymmetric shape of the relativistic transfer functions ( as seen on the maps by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the normalization of the spectrum is higher between @xmath27 and @xmath28 than for the other half - orbit .",
    "also the deformation of the iron line differs between the two half - orbits .",
    "next , we consider short - term flares . their irradiation time is supposed to be comparable to the light - crossing time of the hot spot .",
    "therefore , the spot re - emission evolves from the spot center , where the first incident photons arrive , to the border .",
    "the local lightcurves show a rising phase , a maximum , and a fade - out phase .",
    "we compute models changing the inclination of the observer and the global parameters of the accreting black hole .",
    "we set @xmath29 and calculate reprocessing spectra for spots at disk radii of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in table",
    "[ tab : specdata ] we show hard / soft - flux ratios @xmath32[28 kev]/@xmath33[4 kev ] and equivalent widths of the iron k@xmath0 line for both the locally emitted and the far - away observed spectra of a spot passing `` behind '' the black hole ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the spectra are taken at the maximum of the lightcurve . for almost all local spectra",
    "we examine , the spectral hardness decreases with increasing inclination . after including the relativistic and doppler effects ,",
    "this trend is reversed for the closer - in hot - spots at @xmath35 .",
    "generally , the equivalent width seen by a distant observer , @xmath36(k@xmath0 ) , is diminished in comparison to the local value , @xmath37(k@xmath0 ) , although the definition of the continuum level was made by eye , which induces uncertainties .",
    "the set of parameters for @xmath38 corresponds to the characteristics of the seyfert galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 during a strong flare @xcite . in this case",
    "the ratio @xmath39 is weaker than before , which slightly hardens the reprocessed spectrum . adding dilution by the primary radiation ( primary  =  1 in table  [ tab : specdata ]",
    ", primary  =  0 means pure reflection ) decreases the equivalent widths of the k@xmath0-line , as expected .",

    "there are good arguments to assume that the x - ray irradiation pattern across an agn accretion disk is not azimuthally symmetric .",
    "indications of this asymmetry can be found for ngc  3516 in @xcite , for ngc  5548 in @xcite , or for mrk  766 in @xcite .",
    "the authors use timing analysis of spectral data from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ to constrain orbital motions of localized x - ray sources ( hot spots ) .",
    "more constraints on the azimuthal irradiation pattern of the accretion disk are expected from broader spectral coverage including the region of the compton hump .",
