    "complex interacting quantum systems show a wealth of exciting phenomena , ranging from phase transitions of zero temperature to notions of topological order .",
    "a significant proportion of condensed matter physics is concerned with understanding the features and properties emergent in quantum lattice systems with local interactions .",
    "naive numerical descriptions of such quantum systems with many degrees of freedom require prohibitive resources , however , for the simple reason that the dimension of the underlying hilbert space grows exponentially in the system size .",
    "it has become clear in recent years , however , that ground states  and a number of other natural states  usually occupy only a tiny fraction of this hilbert space , sometimes referred to as its `` physical corner '' ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : corner1 ] ) .",
    "this subset is commonly characterised by states having little entanglement by exhibiting an area law @xcite : entanglement entropies are expected to grow only like the boundary area of any subset @xmath0 of lattice sites , @xmath1 and not extensively like its volume @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : peps ] ) .",
    "such area laws have been proven for all gapped models in @xmath3 @xcite , for free gapped bosonic and fermionic models in @xmath4 @xcite , for ground states of gapped models in the same phase as ones satisfying an area law @xcite , those which have a suitable scaling for heat capacities @xcite or for which the hamiltonian spectra satisfy related conditions @xcite , frustration - free spin models @xcite , and ones that exhibit local topological order @xcite .",
    "the general expectation is that all gapped lattice models satisfy such a behaviour  proving a general area law for gapped lattice models in @xmath5 has indeed become a milestone open problem in theoretical physics .",
    "this behaviour is at the core of powerful numerical algorithms , such as the density - matrix renormalisation group approach @xcite and higher dimensional analogues @xcite . in @xmath3 ,",
    "the situation is particularly clear : matrix - product states essentially `` parameterise '' those one - dimensional quantum states that satisfy an area law for some renyi entropy @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "they approximate such states provably well , which explains why essentially machine precision can be reached with such numerical tools @xcite .",
    "analogously , a common jargon is that higher dimensional analogues  projected entangled pair states ( peps )  can approximate states satisfying area laws , for the same reasoning and with analogue implications . in the same way , one expects those instances of tensor network states to capture the `` physical corner '' .",
    "-dimensional cubic lattices in @xmath5 such that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 , but which can not be approximated by efficient tensor network states , such as ( b ) polynomial projected entangled pair states.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    in this work , we show that this jargon is not quite right : strictly speaking , area laws and approximability with tensor network states are unrelated .",
    "there are even states that satisfy an area law for _ every _ renyi entropy is the familiar von - neumann entropy and @xmath10 the binary logarithm of the schmidt rank . ] @xmath11 but still , no efficient peps can be found . the same holds for multi - scale entanglement renormalisation ( mera ) ansatzes @xcite , as well as all tensor network states that have a short description with low kolmogorov complexity .",
    "not even a quantum computer with post - selection can prepare all states satisfying area laws . moreover , not all states satisfying area laws are eigenstates of local hamiltonians .",
    "the main result of this work , which underlies these conclusions , is that in @xmath5 , the set of states satisfying area laws for all @xmath6 contains a subspace whose dimension scales exponentially with the system size . bringing the study of many - body states and tensor network states into contact with the theory of _ communication complexity _ and _ kolmogorov complexity _",
    "@xcite , it can then be inferred that this subspace can not be parameterised by polynomial classical descriptions only .    by no means ,",
    "however , is this result meant to indicate that area laws are not appropriate intuitive guidelines for approximations with tensor network states .",
    "it is rather aimed to be a significant step towards precisely delineating the boundary between those quantum many - body states that can be efficiently captured and those that can not , and we contribute to the discussion why peps and other tensor network states approximate natural states so well .",
    "area laws without further qualifiers are , strictly speaking , inappropriate for this purpose as the `` corner '' they parameterise is exponentially large .",
    "this work is hence a strong reminder that the programme of identifying that boundary is not finished yet .",

    ", the question at hand has already been settled with the opposite conclusion @xcite .",

    ", we will for the remainder of this paper restrict our consideration to cubic regions @xmath0 only .",
    "it should be clear , however , that all arguments generalise to arbitrary regions @xmath18^d$ ] .",

    "we have hence proven that the connection between entanglement properties and the possibility of an efficient classical description is far more intricate than anticipated .",
    "these results are based on the simple observation that an arbitrary quantum state in @xmath35 dimensions that is embedded into @xmath24 dimensions satisfies a @xmath24-dimensional area law , implying that the set of area law states contains a subspace of exponential dimension .",
    "that is to say , in @xmath5 , one has the freedom to `` dilute '' the entanglement content , in order to still arrive at area laws .",
    "we also demonstrated that this exponential scaling persists if various physical properties , such as translational and rotational invariance , or decaying correlations of local observables , are imposed .",
    "we note however that whilst the latter can be extended to non - local observables of size @xmath96 , our notion of decaying correlations is weaker than the exponential clustering property involving all regions valid for ground states of gapped hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "it remains open whether our results are impeded if the stronger notion of exponential clustering of correlations is imposed .",
    "area laws indeed suggest the expected correlation patterns of naturally occurring ground states , but when put in precise contact with questions of numerical simulation , it turns out that satisfying an area law alone is not sufficient for efficient approximation . picking up the metaphor of the introduction ,",
    "the `` corner of states that can be efficiently described '' is tiny compared to the `` physical corner '' ( fig .",

    "the construction using communication complexity exhibits a semi - explicit class of area law states without a short classical description .",
    "this can be taken as a starting point for further investigation with the aim to identify additional criteria of `` physical '' states whose imposition supplementary to area laws could reduce the `` physical corner '' to sub - exponential size .",
    "a particularly exciting perspective arises from the observation that states with small entanglement content can go along with states having divergent bond dimensions in peps approximations .",
    "this may be taken as a suggestion that there may be states that are in the same phase if symmetries are imposed , but are being classified as being in different phases in a classification of phases of matter building upon tensor network descriptions @xcite .",
