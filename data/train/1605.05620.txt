    "by using an idea of his morse homotopy theory , k.  fukaya constructed in @xcite a topological invariant of 3-manifolds with flat bundles on them that is analogous to chern ",

    "prior to lescop s works , ohtsuki had given in @xcite a considerable refinement of the lmo invariant for 3-manifolds @xmath0 with @xmath1 , which is important in the study of equivariant perturbative invariant for non homology spheres .",
    "it is known that the lmo invariant ( @xcite ) is very strong for homology spheres whereas it is rather weaker for non homology spheres .",
    "it is remarkable that ohtsuki s refined lmo invariant is also very strong for 3-manifolds @xmath0 with @xmath1 , and moreover his equivariant invariant is computable for some examples and yields some beautiful formulas .",
    "we expect that our invariant agrees with ohtsuki s refined lmo invariant .    in @xcite",
    ", we construct an invariant of some degree 1 maps from 3-manifolds to the 3-torus by a method similar to the construction of this paper and apply it to study finite type invariants .",
