    "the vainshtein mechanism was originally proposed by vainshtein @xcite in order to explain how the non - linearities inside massive gravity are able to recover the predictions of general relativity ( gr ) near the gravitational sources . the linear version of massive gravity is excluded at the solar system scale due to the extra contribution coming from the coupling between the scalar component and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism operates through the galileon structure of the scalar components , where the strong coupling scale appears @xcite .",
    "the usual explanation goes to the decoupling limit of the theory where the vectorial component can be ignored since it remains free @xcite . in this way",
    ", the vainshtein mechanism in drgt appears as a consequence of the non - linearities of the theory , able to screen the effect of the scalar component at scales satisfying @xmath4 . for scales satisfying @xmath2 ,",
    "the theory is at the linear regime and then the extra - degrees of freedom play an important role .",
    "the vainshtein scale @xmath3 , appears as the distance where the scalar component and the tensorial one , are equally important . in a previous manuscript",
    ", the author demonstrated that the vainshtein scale also appears as a extremal condition of the dynamical metric when all the degrees of freedom of the theory are inside it @xcite .",
    "written in this form , the dynamical metric becomes invariant under diffeomorphism transformations @xcite . by using this point of view",
    ", the vainshtein conditions could be derived @xcite .",
    "the vainshtein conditions are general in the sense that they allow us to calculate the vainshtein scale for dynamically evolving systems .",
    "the non - linearities of the theory appear implicitly through the source terms coming from the dynamical metric ( @xmath5 ) . in this manuscript ,",
    "i demonstrate that the galileon structure related to the equations of motion of the scalar component in drgt , appear through the @xmath6 component of the vainshtein conditions previously derived in @xcite .",
    "the other conditions are complements of this one .",
    "i go further and i explain how the vainshtein mechanism can be seen as a way to recover the birkhoff theorem for scales satisfying @xmath4 and how the vainshtein mechanism under the same principles can be seen as a proof of the cosmic - no hair conjecture when the cosmological constant is included @xcite .",
    "additionally , i demonstrate how the vainshtein mechanism can be seen as a duality of the particle creation process , able to create an apparent extra - radiation component for observers at scales @xmath2 when the hawking radiation is under study .",
    "this extra component comes from the phase - shift generated from the contributions of the extra - degrees of freedom , which is traduced in extra - particle production inside the bogolubov coefficients unless the asymptotic observers are described with respect extended notions of killing vectors .",
    "this is related to the functional degeneracy analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ eq : migod ] ) , i introduce the usual explanation of the vainshtein mechanism for the cubic galileon . in section ( [ eq : defa ] ) , i review the usual explanation of the vainshtein mechanism in drgt at the decoupling limit . in section ( [ eq : stutwop ] ) , i make a review of the two points of view for understanding the role of the extra - degrees of freedom in massive gravity : the first one is with all the degrees of freedom inside the dynamical metric .",
    "in such a case , it becomes invariant under diffeomorphism transformations .",
    "the second one , is with all the degrees of freedom inside the fiducial metric .",
    "both points of view are equivalent . in section ( [ eq : final1 ] ) , i introduce the schwarzschild de - sitter ( s - ds ) solution , obtained originally in @xcite . in section ( [ eq : final2 ] ) ,",
    "i explain the origin of the vainshtein conditions and its relation with the galileon structure . in section ( [ eq : birkhoffmiau ] )",
    ", i make a brief explanation about the relation between the vainshtein mechanism and the birkhoff theorem , which is not valid in general in drgt . in the same section ,",
    "i describe how the vainshtein mechanism is the responsible for the cosmic no - hair conjecture when the cosmological constant ( @xmath7 ) is included , such that a cosmological horizon appears . in section ( [ eq :",
    "hawking ] ) , i demonstrate that the vainshtein mechanism is a duality with respect to the particle creation process of a black - hole . in this sense , particles would appear for an observer located at distances satisfying @xmath2 unless the observer is defined with respect an extended notion of killing vector in the direction of the `` gauge '' function @xmath0 .",
    "although this observer might describe extra particles coming from the black - hole , in reality they correspond to the extra - degrees of freedom becoming relevant at such scales . on the other hand",
    ", some observers located at scales @xmath4 or even near , must be able to obtain the appropriate value of the black - hole particle production process .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in the standard s - ds space in gr , where the static observer , able to describe the appropriate value of temperature is the observer located at @xmath8 . in a previous manuscript , the author explained that this scale and @xmath3 are connected through the vainshtein conditions @xcite . finally in section ( [ eq : conclu ] ) , i conclude .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism is usually introduced as a mechanism able to recover gr at scales near the gravitational source @xcite .",
    "the mechanism operates through the non - linearities of the theory , able to screen the additional attractive effect of the scalar degree of freedom . in a previous manuscript",
    ", the author demonstrated that the vainshtein radius corresponds to the extremal condition for the dynamical metric in unitary gauge @xcite .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism then appeared as the vanishing of the spatial derivative of the gauge transformation function @xmath0 .",
    "this is just approximate since in reality the derivative is negligible rather than zero . in the usual notion of vainshtein mechanism , the helicity - zero component of the stckelberg fields , represented by @xmath9 , behaves as a scalar field in some limit ; obeying the following symmetry @xcite :    @xmath10    the general galileon action takes the form :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath7 is the strong coupling of the theory . in the decoupling limit of massive gravity ,",
    "the massive action contains similar terms with respect to the previous expression .",
    "if we assume a static and spherically symmetry source , then we can define :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mass of the source . for a static and spherically symmetric source ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the helicity-0 components of the stckelberg fields become of the form @xmath15 .",
    "in such a case , the field equation for the lagrangian ( [ eq : pounds ] ) becomes :    @xmath16    by integrating both sides with respect to @xmath17 , we get the following result :    @xmath18    from this previous expression , we can observe that for large scales , the second term on the left - hand side becomes negligible .",
    "in such a case , the linear term dominates . on the other hand , for short scales",
    "we have the opposite behavior , namely , the non - linear term becomes dominant .",
    "then there must be a distance where both contributions become equivalent .",
    "there are two ways for deriving such scale .",
    "the first one is by just saying that the linear contribution has to be of the same order of magnitude as the non - linear one for some scale @xmath19 for the expression ( [ eq : miaujunior11 ] ) .",
    "in such a case , we have :    @xmath20    if we solve this system of equations , we get :    @xmath21    which corresponds to the vainshtein scale @xcite . at this scale ,",
    "the , the helicity-0 component @xmath22 , can take one of the following values :    @xmath23    on the other hand , the other way for deriving the same scale is by taking the spatial derivative on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : miaujunior11 ] ) and then sending the result to zero .",
    "then we obtain :    @xmath24    the previous equation provides two possible solutions .",
    "they are given by :    @xmath25    for consistency , it is necessary to get a single solution .",
    "this only happens when @xmath26 .",

    "the idea is to show that the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , contain the galileon structure , similar to the one explained in section ( [ eq : migod ] ) , if this is true , then the vainshtein mechanism will appear exactly in the same form as in the case of the galileon lagrangian .",
    "for that purpose , we have to use the explanations of section ( [ eq : herela ] ) . starting with the infinitesimal definition ( [ eq : derhaampaper ] ) or ( [ eq : thisy ] ) , and using the redefinitions @xmath132 , it is possible to observe that from the so - called vainshtein conditions ( [ eq : verg ] ) , ( [ eq : miaumiaumiau ] ) and ( [ eq : solvef ] ) , only the second one ( corresponding to the @xmath6 component ) , has the galileon structure similar to the one found in eq .",

    "the vainshtein mechanism for the solutions obtained in @xcite , appears explicitly for quantities involving the time - parameter .",
    "it means that a particle moving around a spherically symmetric source , will experience exactly the same motion as a particle in gr , as far as the motion is stationary ( time - independent ) .",
    "this is true if we are able to define the appropriate conserved quantities .",
    "let s write the action of a test particle moving around the source .",
    "the gauge invariant action is in agreement with @xcite :    @xmath134    after replacing the metric ( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) inside the previous expression and then taking into account the conserved quantities :    @xmath135    we obtain the conservation equation :    @xmath136    for stationary spacetimes , the gauge - function is @xmath137 in agreement with the analysis performed in @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : momokojunior ] ) shows that the description of a test particle for spherically symmetric objects .",
    "( [ eq : momokojunior ] ) , demonstrates that the motion of a test particle is not affected by the presence of the extra - degrees of freedom as far as the time component becomes ignorable .",
    "this is true if we define the appropriate conserved quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "as far as the system becomes dynamically evolving , the role of the vainshtein mechanism for restoring gr , becomes relevant .",
    "in gr , the birkhoff theorem states that the only vacuum solution with spherical symmetry is the schwarzschild one ( for asymptotically flat spaces ) or the s - ds if we include a cosmological constant ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it states that there are no time - dependent solutions of this form . in the previous section ,",
    "we have used the quasi - stationary approximation for the spherically symmetric solution ( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) , which implies @xmath137 .",
    "the non - diagonal contribution @xmath139 , coming explicitly from the stckelberg field contribution , breaks the static condition ( not necessarily the stationary one ) .",
    "then the birkhoff theorem is not valid in massive gravity and a series of vacuum solutions might emerge .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite however , that the generic solution is written as :    @xmath140    with @xmath141 . the birkhoff theorem in its standard form suggests that we can determine the function @xmath0 precisely such that it is possible to cancel the crossed terms @xmath142 coming from the generic metric ( [ eq : itp ] ) . determining this function precisely ,",
    "is possible for the case of two - free parameters as it is explained in @xcite . for the case @xmath96 ( one - free parameter )",
    "worked in @xcite , the function @xmath0 is arbitrary in principle . since that function contains the information of the extra - degrees of freedom in the spatial dependence of @xmath0 , then the degeneracy of the theory comes from the stckelberg fields . in this way",
    "the birkhoff theorem is in general not satisfied in drgt .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism however , compensates this apparent pathology by keeping the extra - degrees of freedom negligible for scales satisfying the condition @xmath4 . in such scales ,",
    "the condition @xmath143 is satisfied and then the birkhoff theorem is recovered , at least partially . on the other hand , for scales near the cosmological horizon @xmath144 , the vainshtein mechanism also operates and provides the de - sitter solution as the only attractor one for an asymptotically de - sitter space since still the condition @xmath145 is satisfied .",
    "this is by the way the cosmic no hair conjecture , already studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "then we can conclude that the cosmic no - hair conjecture is a manifestation of the vainshtein mechanism at large scales in drgt .",
    "note that the non - linearities appear through the source terms which are implicitly inside the dynamical metric . then even in vacuum",
    ", the vainshtein mechanism operates in an implicit form . in other words , it is not necessary to have an explicit source in order to perceive the vainshtein mechanism effects .",
    "the scales in physics are independent on whether matter is present or not .",
    "in curved spacetimes it is natural to expect the possibility of particle creation by black - holes .",
    "the original work developed by hawking @xcite used the fact that the particle is an observer - dependent notion . here",
    "i will follow the original hawking approach because it is the most natural in order to explain the possible discrepancy between drgt and gr .",
    "the key point of the analysis is the direction of the time - like killing vector which becomes arbitrary in some sense after the vainshtein radius .",
    "this generates a possible extra phase contribution for the black - hole radiation which however does not come from the horizon itself .",
    "it comes as a contribution of the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory which become relevant after the vainshtein scale .",
    "this contribution is not perceived by the observer located below the vainshtein scale where the extra - degrees of freedom become negligible .",
    "this makes the vainshtein scale and its coincidence analyzed in @xcite quite relevant at this level . for simplicity in what follows",
    "i will assume an asymptotically - flat space such that the radiation coming from the cosmological horizon and the vainshtein mechanism involved at that scale , do not become relevant inside the analysis .",
    "the space can be asymptotically flat even for the s - ds solution in drgt , if we take the solution with two free parameters and the gauge transformation function defined with @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "this however will not be relevant in the analysis .",
    "for simplicity i will also assume that the extra - degrees of freedom appear immediately after the vainshtein scale , such that @xmath147 at the vainshtein scale , but it becomes @xmath148 for an infinitesimal displacement @xmath149 going way from the source ( larger values of @xmath17 ) .",
    "under the assumption of asymptotic flatness , the metric is just the schwarzschild one .",
    "the penrose diagram of this space is well known ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) ) . as a starting point",
