    "while quantum physics is expected to play an important role near the big bang when the universe was small , there are a number of differing opinions on how to quantise the classical universe , see reviews in @xcite , leading to different approaches to quantum cosmology .",

    "while this approach originated in statistical mechanics , it has wider applicability such as motivating the structure of the usual schrodinger equation @xcite and its potential nonlinear modifications to model new short distance effects@xcite .    in our previous study @xcite , which we briefly review in the next section",
    ", we treated the nonlinearity of the modified wdw equation ( [ nl1 ] ) perturbatively and studied a truncated linearised equation with an effective potential . in this paper",
    "we present a full investigation for the case of a de sitter universe .",
    "the de sitter universe is a reasonable model for early stages of inflation and furthermore , if the current accelerating phase of our universe continues , then at late times it can again be well approximated as a de sitter universe .    treating the universe as an isolated system , one may apply quantum mechanics to the whole de sitter universe regardless of its size ; in other words , study the wavefunction of the universe .",
    "our main intent in this paper is to see how the classical de sitter dynamics is modified by information - theoretically motivated corrections to the wdw equation , extending the previous @xcite approximate investigation .",

    "the appearance of @xmath31 in ( [ nl1 ] ) implies a nonlocality of the modified wdw equation which takes the form of a difference - differential equation .",
    "while the equation itself looks complicated , it follows from a relatively simple lagrangian involving the kullback - leibler ( kl ) information measure @xcite : the nonlinear piece @xmath32 in eq.([nl1 ] ) arises from maximising , in the spirit of the maximum uncertainty method , the following term in the action @xmath33    the kullback - leibler measure is clearly a relative uncertainty measure which generalises the usual gibbs - shannon entropy of statistical mechanics , and which reduces , as @xmath28 , to the  fisher \" information measure used in ref.@xcite for motivating the usual schrodinger equation within the information - theoretic framework .",
    "indeed , as discussed in @xcite , the ( @xmath34-regularised ) kl measure is probably the simplest nonsingular measure which interpolates between the shannon and fisher measures and which keeps some desirable properties such as the scale invariance mentioned above .    in physical terms",

    "in other words , in the modified classical dynamics a backward evolving classical universe will experience a bounce instead of shrinking to zero size .    in the sections below we venture beyond the perturbative analysis of ref.@xcite to uncover some new features of eq.([nl1 ] ) .",
    "writing the exact wavefunction in terms of its amplitude and phase , @xmath51 , with @xmath37 and @xmath52 real , the imaginary part of the wdw equation ( [ nl1 ] ) is then the continuity equation @xmath53 which can be solved to give @xmath54 the constant current @xmath55 is fixed by requiring our nonperturbative solution approach the asymptotic form , beyond the matching point , the nonlinear wdw solution will eventually deviate from the form ( [ asymp ] ) indicating an eventual departure from the current classical evolution .",

    "the equation ( [ diff ] ) for the _ probability density _ does not depend on the sign of @xmath55 and hence describes both possibilities , either an expanding or contracting universe ; the specific _ wavefunction _ describing either possibility does depend on @xmath55 . as @xmath28 ,",

    "however , for @xmath36 the difference equation ( [ diff ] ) restricts the range of @xmath56 as we are required , by definition , to preserve the positivity of the probability density .",
    "when starting with @xmath66 at some initial point and using the difference equation to move forward or backward , it is possible that one reaches a point at which @xmath67 , beyond which @xmath68 or becomes complex , as the equation ( [ diff ] ) by itself does not guarantee a real or positive @xmath31 : the kinematic constraint @xmath69 must be self - consistently imposed .    in sects.(4,5 )",

    "direct solution of that nonlinear differential equation shows oscillations for @xmath37 , as does the first order iterative version described by the linear schrodinger equation with effective potential ( [ iter ] ) .",
    "however neither of these approximations to eq.([diff ] ) display the limiting values @xmath137 seen in the nonperturbative difference equation ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "the oscillations we have observed here do not seem to be related to the oscillations of the non - perturbative mode of a similar nonlinear schrodinger equation studied in ref.@xcite : the latter oscillations were of constant wavelength .",
    "as the wdw equation is time - independent , it can not describe the time - evolution of a universe .",
    "furthermore the probability density refers to the likelihood of observing a universe of a particular size in an ensemble .",
    "therefore , in order to gain some insight into the dynamics of a single universe , in particular near @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we return to the classical domain . near the nodes , we see from ( [ ds ] ) that @xmath138 is large and as argued in refs.@xcite it may be identified with the classical momentum , as in the discussion after eq.([asymp ] ) .    in that approximation",

    "while a modified dynamics replacing the big bang by a big bounce might have been expected , it is remarkable that the evolution of the universe at large scales has also been modified by the nominally weak quantum nonlinearity @xmath32 : instead of an unending exponential expansion , there can now be a big crunch .",
    "this significant modification of the classical dynamics is due to the enhancement @xcite of the nonlinearity @xmath32 near the nodes of the probability density . the current accelerating phase of our universe is well modeled by a dominant cosmological constant .",
    "we interpret our results as suggesting that such an accelerating phase can not continue indefinitely but will be replaced by a contracting phase . since our information - theoretic approach does not presume a specific micro - dynamics responsible for the nonlinearity @xmath32 , it might be summarising various possibilities . for example , in ref.@xcite a semi - classical analysis showed that in gravitational theories with extra dimensions , such as those that appear in m - theory @xcite , a vacuum state with non - zero cosmological constant is generically unstable , one possibility being an eventual collapse in a big crunch : our results are compatible with those of @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to note that cyclic models of the universe @xcite inspired by m - theory @xcite have been proposed . of course to truly see a cyclic time - evolution in the quantum domain of our model we need to go beyond the frw-@xmath156 case and include , for example , a massless scalar field to act as an internal clock @xcite , the frw-@xmath179 model .",
    "the study of the frw-@xmath179 model is important since the classical big bang has a curvature singularity .",
    "based on our perturbative study of the latter model in ref.@xcite , and our analysis of the nonlinearity @xmath32 in section(5 ) , it is plausible that a non - singular cyclic evolution of the quantum universe might also be seen for the frw-@xmath179 model within our nonlinear wdw framework @xcite .",
    "also , a cyclic evolution should also hold for models in which the cosmological  constant \" is slowly varying , in particular for some realistic inflationary potentials @xcite .    ultimately the free parameters",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 need to be fixed by comparing computations of observables with empirical data . on the other side ,",
    "the robustness of the theoretical conclusions may be checked by examining information measures which are deformations of the kl measure @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the nonlinear difference equation ( [ diff ] ) may be viewed as a one - dimensional nonlinear map and could possibly exhibit chaos for certain range of parameters @xcite",
    ". it might be useful to investigate the physical relevance of such behaviour for the cosmology considered .",
