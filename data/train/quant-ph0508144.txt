    "decoherence of quantum systems induced by interactions with low - frequency reservoirs is endemic in solid - state quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite .",
    "a frequently encountered scenario is the coupling of a two - level system ( qubit ) to a mesoscopic bath of two - level systems such as defects or background spins .",
    "the manifestly non - markovian nature of system - reservoir coupling in this scenario presents challenges for the description of the long term dynamics as well as for fault tolerant quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "the primary experimental signature of a low - frequency reservoir is an unknown but slowly changing effective field that can substantially reduce the ability to predict the system dynamics .",
    "a possible strategy to mitigate this effect is to carry out a quantum measurement which allows for an estimation of the unknown reservoir field by controlled manipulation and measurement of the qubit .",
    "a precise estimation of the field acting on the large hilbert space of the reservoir requires , however , many repetitions of the procedure : this constitutes a major limitation since in almost all cases of interest projective measurements on the qubit are slow @xcite and in turn will limit the accuracy of the estimation that can be achieved before the reservoir field changes .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a method for estimating an unknown quantum field associated with a mesoscopic spin ensemble . by using an incoherent version of the _ quantum phase estimation algorithm _",
    ", @xcite we show that the number of qubit measurements scale linearly with the number of significant digits of the estimation .",
    "we only assume the availability of single qubit operations such as preparation of a known qubit state , rotations in the @xmath0-plane , and measurement , of which only rotations need to be fast .",
    "the estimation procedure that we describe would suppress the dephasing of the qubit induced by the reservoir ; indeed , an interaction with the estimated field leads to coherent unitary evolution that could be used for quantum control of the qubit .",
    "if the measurement of the reservoir observable is sufficiently fast and strong , it may in turn suppress the free evolution of the reservoir in a way that is reminiscent of a quantum zeno effect .",
    "after presenting a detailed description of the measurement procedure and discussing its performance and limitations , we focus on a specific application of the procedure for the case of a single quantum dot ( qd ) electron spin interacting with the mesoscopic nuclear spin ensemble defined by the qd .",
    "it is by now well known that the major source of decoherence for the electron - spin qubits in qds @xcite is the hyperfine interaction between the spins of the lattice nuclei and the electron  @xcite .",
    "a particular feature of the hyperfine - related dephasing is the long correlation time ( @xmath1 ) associated with nuclear spins .",
    "this enables techniques such as spin - echo to greatly suppress the dephasing  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested to measure the nuclear field to reduce electron spin decoherence times ; precise knowledge of the instantaneous value of the field would even allow for controlled unitary operations .",
    "for example , knowledge of the field in adjacent qds yields an effective field gradient that could be used in recently proposed quantum computing approaches with pairs of electron spins  @xcite .",
    "moreover , with sufficient control , the collective spin of the nuclei in a qd may be used as a highly coherent qubit - implementation in its own right  @xcite .",
    "in the following we consider an indirect measurement scheme in which the system under investigation is brought into interaction with a probe spin ( a two - level system in our case ) in a suitably prepared state . measuring the probe spin after a given interaction time @xmath2 yields information about the state of the system .",
    "we assume the mesoscopic system evolves only slowly compared to the procedure , and further that the measurement does not directly perturb the system . in essence , we are performing a series of quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements on the system with the probe spin .",
    "we consider an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath3 which lends itself easily to a measurement of the observable @xmath4 .",
    "the qnd requirement is satisfied for @xmath5 \\rightarrow 0 $ ] .",
    "the applicability of @xmath6 in situations of physical interest is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] . given this interaction , the strategy to measure @xmath4 is in close analogy to the so - called ramsey interferometry approach , which we now briefly review .",
    "for example , an atomic transition has a fixed , scalar value for @xmath4 which corresponds to the transition frequency . by measuring @xmath4 as well as possible in a given time period",
    ", the measurement apparatus can be locked to the fixed value , as happens in atomic clocks .",
    "the probe spin @xmath7 is prepared in a state @xmath8 .",
    "it will undergo evolution under @xmath9 according to @xmath10 .",
    "after an interaction time @xmath2 , the probe spin s state will be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the precession frequency for the probe spin .",
    "a measurement of the spin in the @xmath13 basis yields a probability @xmath14 of being in the @xmath15 state .",
    "accumulating the results of many such measurements allows one to estimate the value for @xmath16 ( and therefore @xmath4 ) .",
    "in general , the best estimate is limited by interaction time : for an expected uncertainty in @xmath4 of @xmath17 and an appropriate choice of @xmath2 , @xmath18 measurements with fixed interaction times @xmath19 can estimate @xmath4 to no better than @xmath20 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in our scenario ,",
    "the situation is slightly different in that @xmath4 is now a quantum variable . for a state @xmath21 in the hilbert space of the system",
    "@xmath22 which is an eigenstate of @xmath4 with eigenvalue @xmath23 , the coupling induces oscillations : @xmath24 \\ .",

    "( [ e : class ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ e : quant ] ) indicates that the same techniques used in atomic clocks ( ramsey interferometry ) could be used in this scenario to measure @xmath26 and thus project the bath in some eigenstate of @xmath4 with an eigenvalue of @xmath26 to within the uncertainty of the measurement .    beyond the ramsey approach",
    ", there are several ways to extract this information , which differ in the choice of interaction times @xmath27 and the subsequent measurements .",
    "the general results on quantum metrology of @xcite show , however , that the standard ramsey scheme with fixed interaction time @xmath2 is already optimal in that the scaling of the final variance with the inverse of the total interaction time can not be improved without using entangled probe states . nevertheless , the ramsey scheme will not be the most suitable in all circumstances .",
    "for example , we have assumed so far that preparation and measurement of the probe spin is fast when compared to @xmath19 .",
    "however , in many situations with single quantum systems , this assumption is no longer true , and it then becomes desirable to minimize the number of preparation / measurement steps in the scheme .",

    "the next measurement result @xmath29 further reduces the distribution ( bottom plots ) .",
    "[ f1],width=288 ]    we now show that by varying the interaction time and the final measurements such that each step yields the maximum information about @xmath26 , we can obtain the same accuracy as standard ramsey techniques with a similar interaction time , but only a _ logarithmic _ number of probe spin preparations and measurements . as a trivial case , if @xmath4 had eigenvalues @xmath30 and @xmath31 only , then measuring the probe in the @xmath32-basis after an interaction time @xmath33 , we find @xmath34 with certainty , if the system are in an @xmath35-eigenstate ; if they were initially in a superposition , measuring the probe projects the system to the corresponding eigenspaces",
    ". we can extend this simple example ( in the spirit of the quantum phase estimation algorithm @xcite and its application to the measurement of a classical field @xcite ) to implement an @xmath4-measurement by successively determining the binary digits of the eigenvalue . we start with the ideal case , then generalize to a more realistic scenario .",
    "if all the eigenvalues of @xmath4 are an integer multiple of some known number @xmath36 and bounded by @xmath37 , then this procedure yields a perfect @xmath4-measurement in @xmath18 steps : let us write all eigenvalues as @xmath38 .",
    "the sum we denote by @xmath39 and also use the notation @xmath40 .",
    "starting now with an interaction time @xmath41 , we have @xmath42",
    ". hence the state of the probe electron is flipped if and only if @xmath43 . therefore measuring the probe electron in state @xmath34 projects the nuclei to the subspace of even(odd ) multiples of @xmath36 ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "we denote the result of the first measurement by @xmath44 if the outcome was `` @xmath34 '' .",
    "all the higher digits have no effect on the measurement result since they induce rotations by an integer multiple of @xmath45 which have no effect on the probabilities @xmath46 .    to measure the higher digits , we reduce the interaction time by half in each subsequent step : @xmath47 until we reach @xmath48 in the final and shortest step . for @xmath49 the rotation angle @xmath50 ( mod @xmath45 ) in the @xmath51th step does not only depend on the @xmath51th binary digit of @xmath39 but also on the previous digits ( which have already been measured , giving results @xmath52 ) .",

    ", we note that the proposed scheme is nothing but an `` incoherent '' implementation of the quantum phase estimation algorithm : as originally proposed , this algorithm allows measurement of the eigenvalue of a unitary @xmath67 by preparing @xmath18 qubits ( the control - register ) in the state @xmath68 ( i.e. , the equal superposition of all computational basis states @xmath69 ) and performing controlled-@xmath70 gates between the @xmath51th qubit and an additional register prepared in an eigenstate @xmath21 of @xmath67 with @xmath71 .",
    "the controlled-@xmath67 gates let each computational basis state acquire a @xmath39-dependent phase : @xmath72 .",
    "then the inverse quantum fourier transformation ( qft ) is performed on the control register , which is then measured in the computational basis , yielding the binary digits of @xmath39 . performing the qft is still a forbidding task , but not necessary here :",
    "the sequence of measurements in the rotated basis @xmath57 described above is in fact an implementation of the combination of qft and measurement into one step .",
    "this was previously suggested in different contexts @xcite .      in general , there is no known @xmath36 such that all eigenvalues @xmath39 of @xmath4 are integer multiples of @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed below , the above procedure can still produce a very accurate measurement of @xmath4 if sufficiently many digits are measured .",
    "now we evaluate the performance of the proposed measurement scheme in the realistic case of non - integer eigenvalues .",
    "since here we are interested in the fundamental limits of the scheme , we will for now assume all operations on the probe qubit ( state preparation , measurement , and timing ) to be exact ; the effect of these imperfection is considered in sec .",

    "this means that performing @xmath18 measurements yields a state with @xmath4-uncertainty @xmath110 .",
    "for example , we need about @xmath111 interactions with the probe spin to reach the @xmath112-level in @xmath113 and about @xmath114 more for every additional factor of @xmath115 .    the overall procedure requires a total time @xmath116 , which is an interaction time ( determined mainly by the time @xmath117 needed for the least significant digit probed ) and the time to make @xmath18 measurements ( @xmath118 is the time to make a single measurement ) .",
    "we obtain for the average uncertainty an upper bound in terms of the interaction time @xmath119 needed : @xmath120 immediately the similarity with standard atomic clock approaches is apparent , as the uncertainty decreases with the square root of the interaction time . however , while for an atomic clock scheme , in which the interaction time per measurement is kept fixed to @xmath121 , the total time to reach the precision of eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) is @xmath122 . for our method the measurement time",
    "is reduced dramatically by a time @xmath123 . in this manner",
    "our approach requires a polynomial , rather than exponential , number of measurements for a given accuracy , though the overall interaction time is the same for both techniques .",
    "it may be remarked that even the scaling in interaction time differs significantly if other figures of merit are considered .",
    "for example , our scheme provides a _ square - root speed - up _ in @xmath124 over the standard ramsey scheme if the aim is to maximize the information gain or to minimize the confidence interval @xcite .",
    "up until now we have considered an idealized situation in which the value of @xmath4 does not change over the course of the measurement and in which preparation and measurement of the probe system work with unit fidelity .",
    "let us now investigate the robustness of our scheme in the presence of these errors .",
    ": the logarithm of the improvement @xmath125 is plotted versus the number @xmath18 of binary digits measured .",
    "the solid lines represent different error rates ( @xmath126 : black circles ; @xmath127 blue crosses ; @xmath128 : red triangles ; and @xmath129 : green diamonds ) .",
    "+ the broken red curves ( triangles ) demonstrate the benefit of simple error correction ( for @xmath128 ) : strategy i ( 3 repetitions per digit , use majority result ; either for all digits or only for leading @xmath130 digits ) : ( dash - dotted , dotted  almost undistinguishable ) ; strategy ii ( increase number of repetitions for more significant digits to 7 repetitions for leading @xmath131 digits , 5 for next @xmath131 , and 3 for next @xmath132 ) : dashed .",
    "we see that the latter provides a better accuracy than the uncorrected @xmath127 curve .",
    "[ f2],width=316 ]    by relying upon a small number of measurements , the scheme we described becomes more susceptible to preparation and measurement errors .",
    "an error in the determination of the @xmath133th digit leads to an increase of the error probability in the subsequent digits .",
    "this error amplification leads to a scaling of the final error of @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the probability of incurring a preparation or measurement error in a single step .",
    "we confirm this with monte carlo simulations of the measurement procedure ( fig .",
    "[ f2]a ) , leading to an asymptotic bound : @xmath136 standard error correction ( ec ) techniques can be used to overcome this problem .",
    "e.g. , by performing three measurements for each digit and using majority vote , the effective probability of error can be reduced to @xmath137  at the expense of tripling the interaction time and number of measurements .",
    "while this may look like a big overhead , it should be noted that the scheme can be significantly improved : the least significant digits do not require any ec . for them ,",
    "the scheme gives noisy results even for error rate @xmath126 due to the undetermined digits of @xmath4 , this does not affect the most significant @xmath130 digits .",
    "this indicates that it may be enough to apply ec for the leading digits .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f2]b , this simple ec strategy provides a significant improvement in the asymptotic @xmath138 .",
    "this is hardly changed , when ec is applied only to the leading half of the digits .",
    "thus only twice as many measurements ( and an additional interaction time @xmath139 which is @xmath140 ) is needed for an order - of - magnitude improvement in @xmath138 . by repeating the measurement of more important digits even more often",
    ", the effect of technical errors can be reduced even further , as confirmed by monte carlo simulations ( fig .",
    "we also note that further improvements ( beyond @xmath18 digits ) can be achieved by this technique .",
    "in essence , choosing a digital approach to error correction for our digital technique yields substantially better performance than adapting the digital technique to an analog approach .      in practice",
    ", internal bath dynamics will lead to fluctuations in @xmath4 , such that @xmath141 for times @xmath2 and @xmath142 that are sufficiently different .",
    "furthermore , apparatus errors , as outlined above , lead to errors in our measurement procedure .",
    "we will assume that the variations of @xmath4 are slow over short time intervals , allowing us to approximate the @xmath18 bit measurement process as a continuous measurement over the time @xmath143 with some additional noise with variance @xmath144",
    ". then we will find the expected difference in our measurement result and the value of @xmath4 at a later time .    under the above approximations the value of the @xmath133th such measurement ( where a complete set of @xmath18 bits takes a time @xmath143 and",

    "we remark that this approach for estimation in the presence of bath fluctuations is not optimal ( kalman filtering  @xcite would be more appropriate for making an estimation of @xmath4 using the measurement results ) .",
    "furthermore , it does not account for the non - linear aspects of our measurement procedure , nor does it incorporate any effect of the measurement on the _ evolution _ of the bath ( e.g. , quantum zeno effect ) .",
    "more detailed investigations of these aspects of the process should be considered in an optimal control setting .",
    "nonetheless , our simple analysis above indicates that slow decorrelation of the bath will lead to modest additional error in the estimate of @xmath4 .",

    "( [ e : decor ] ) , the best measurement time is given by @xmath206 and for the values used above , @xmath207 is optimal .",
    "we note as a direct corollary that our measurement scheme provides a sensitive probe of the nuclear spin dynamics on nanometer length scales .",
    "we now consider implications of these results for improving the performance of nuclear spin ensembles , both as quantum memory  @xcite and as a qubit  @xcite .",
    "the dominant error mechanism is the same as for other spin - qubit schemes in qds : uncertainty in @xmath187 .",
    "the proposed measurement scheme alleviates this problem .",
    "however , the nuclear spin ensembles operate in a subspace of collective states @xmath208 and @xmath209 , where the first is a `` dark state '' , characterized by @xmath210 ( and the second is @xmath211 , where @xmath212 ) . thus @xmath208 is an @xmath213 eigenstate and can not be an @xmath187 eigenstate when @xmath214 ( except for full polarization ) .",
    "therefore , the measurement [ which essentially projects to certain @xmath4-eigenspaces  ( @xmath215 $ ] ) ] moves the system out of the computational space , leading to leakage errors .",
    "the incommensurate requirements of measuring @xmath187 and using an @xmath213 eigenstate place a additional restriction on the precision of the measurement . the optimal number of digits can be estimated in perturbation theory , using an interaction time @xmath216 and numerical results @xcite on the polarization dependence of @xmath17 .",
    "we find that for high polarization @xmath217 a relative error of @xmath218 is achievable .",
    "we have shown that a measurement approach based on quantum phase estimation can accurately measure a slowly varying mesoscopic environment coupled to a qubit via a pure dephasing hamiltonian . by letting a qubit interact for a sequence of well controlled times and measuring its state after the interaction ,",
    "the value of the dephasing variable can be determined , thus reducing significantly the dephasing rate .",
    "the procedure requires fast single qubit rotations , but can tolerate realistically slow qubit measurements , since the phase estimation approach minimizes the number of measurements .",
    "limitations due to measurement and preparation errors may be overcome by combining our approach with standard error correction techniques .",
    "fluctuations in the environment can also be tolerated , and our measurement still provides the basis for a good estimate , if the decorrelation time of the environment is not too short .    in view of the implementation of our scheme , we have considered the hyperfine coupling of an electron spin in a quantum dot to the nuclear spin ensemble our calculations show that the overhauser field in a quantum dot can be accurately measured in times shorter that the nuclear decorrelation time by shuttling suitably prepared electrons through the dot .",
    "given recent advances in electron measurement and control @xcite this protocol could be used to alleviate the effect of hyperfine decoherence of electron spin qubits and allow for detailed study of the nuclear spin dynamics in quantum dots .",
    "our approach complements other approaches to measuring the overhauser field in a quantum dot that have recently been explored @xcite .",
    "while we discussed a single electron in a single quantum dot , the method can also be applied , with modification to preparation and measurement procedures , subspace such as the singlet , and measuring in this basis as well  @xcite , the scheme would measure the @xmath160-component of the nuclear spin difference between the dots . to measure the total overhauser field , superpositions of the @xmath219 triplet states have to be used . ] to the case of two electrons in a double dot @xcite .    as we have seen , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hint ] ) can serve as a good approximation to more general qubit - environment coupling in the case of weak coupling and a non - degenerate qubit .",
    "therefore , we expect that this technique may find application in other systems with long measurement times and slowly varying mesoscopic environments .",
