    "the issue of designing the timetable for the courses of the incoming term is a typical problem that universities or other academic institutions face at each semester .",
    "there are a large number of variants of this problem , depending on the specific regulations at the involved institutions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among the different variants , two in particular",
    "are now considered standard , and featured at the international timetabling competitions itc-2002 and itc-2007 @xcite .",
    "these standard formulations are the _ post - enrollment course timetabling _",
    "( pe - ctt ) @xcite and _ curriculum - based course timetabling _",
    "( cb - ctt ) @xcite , which have received an appreciable attention in the research community so that many recent articles deal with either one of them .",
    "the distinguishing difference between the two formulations is the origin of the main constraint of the problem , i.e. , the conflicts between courses that prevent one from scheduling them simultaneously . indeed , in pe - ctt",
    "the source of conflicts is the actual student enrollment whereas in cb - ctt the courses in conflict are those that belong to the same predefined group of courses , or curricula .",
    "however , this is only one of the differences , which actually include many other distinctive features and cost components .",
    "for example in pe - ctt each course is a self - standing event , whereas in cb - ctt a course consists of multiple lectures .",
    "consequently the soft constraints are different : in pe - ctt they are all related to events , penalizing late , consecutive , and isolated ones , while in cb - ctt they mainly involve curricula and courses , ensuring compactness in a curriculum , trying to evenly spread the lectures of a course in the weekdays , and possibly preserving the same room for a course .    in this work we focus on cb - ctt , and we build upon our previous work on this problem @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients of our method are    a fast single - stage simulated annealing ( sa ) method , and    a comprehensive statistical analysis methodology featuring a principled parameter tuning phase    .",
    "the aim of the analysis is to model the relationship between the most relevant parameters of the solver and the features of the instance under consideration .",
    "the proposed approach tackles the parameter selection as a classification problem , and builds a rule for choosing the set of parameters most likely to perform well for a given instance , on the basis of specific features .",
    "the effectiveness of this methodology is confirmed by the experimental results on two groups of validation instances .",
    "we are able to show that our method compares favorably with all the state - of - the - art methods on the available instances . as an additional contribution of this paper ,",
    "we extend the set of available problem instances by collecting several new real - world instances that can be added to the set of standard benchmarks and included in future comparison .",
    "the source code of the solver developed for this work is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/satt/public-cb-ctt .",
    "the problem formulation we consider in this paper is essentially the version proposed for the itc-2007 , which is by far the most popular .",
    "the detailed formulation is presented in @xcite , however , in order to keep the paper self - contained , we briefly report it also in the following .",
    "alternative formulations of the problem , used in the experimental part of the paper ( sect .",
    "[ sec : other - formulations ] ) , are described in @xcite .",
    "essentially , the problem consists of the following entities    * days , timeslots , and periods . *",
    ": :    we are given a number of _ teaching days _ in the week .",
    "each day is    split into a fixed number of _",
    "timeslots_. a _ period _ is a pair    composed of a day and a timeslot . *",
    "courses and teachers . * : :    each course consists of number of _ lectures _ to be scheduled in    distinct periods , it is attended by a number of _ students _ , and is    taught by a _",
    "teacher_. for each course , there is a minimum number of    days across which the lectures of the course should be spread .",
    "moreover , there are some periods in which the course can not be    scheduled ( e.g. , teacher s or students availabilities ) . * rooms . * : :    each _ room _ has a _ capacity _ , i.e. , a number of available seats .",
    "* curricula . * : :    a _ curriculum _ is a group of courses that share common students .",
    "consequently , courses belonging to the same curriculum are _ in    conflict _ and can not be scheduled at the same period .",
    "a solution of the problem is an assignment of a period ( day and timeslot ) and a room to all lectures of each course so as to satisfy a set of _ hard _ constraints and to minimize the violations of _ soft _ constraints described in the following .",
    "there are three types of hard constraints    : : :    two lectures can not take place simultaneously in the same room . : : :    lectures of courses in the _ same curriculum _ , or _ taught by the same    teacher _ , must be scheduled in different periods . : : :    a course may not be available for being scheduled in a certain period .      for the formulation itc-2007",
    "there are four types of soft constraints    : : :    the capacity of the room assigned to each lecture must be greater than    or equal to the number of students attending the corresponding course .",
    "the penalty for the violation of this constraint is measured by the    number of students in excess .",
    ": : :    the lectures of each course can not be tightly packed , but they must be    spread into a given minimum number of days .",
    ": : :    lectures belonging to a curriculum should be adjacent to each other    ( i.e. , be assigned to consecutive periods ) .",
    "we account for a violation    of this constraint every time , for a given curriculum , there is one    lecture not adjacent to any other lecture of the same curriculum    within the same day .",
    ": : :    all lectures of a course should be given in the same room .",
    "for all the details , including input and output data formats and validation tools , we refer to @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the literature on cb - ctt .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows : we firstly describe the solution approaches based on metaheuristic techniques ; secondly , we report the contributions on exact approaches and on methods for obtaining lower bounds ; finally , we discuss papers that investigate additional aspects related to the problem , such as instance generation and multi - objective formulations . a recent survey covering all these topics is provided by @xcite .",
    "@xcite solves the problem by applying a constraint - based solver that incorporates several local search algorithms operating in three stages : ( i ) a construction phase that uses an _",
    "iterative forward search _ algorithm to find a feasible solution , ( ii ) a first search phase delegated to a _ hill climbing _ algorithm , followed by ( iii ) a _ great deluge _ or _ simulated annealing _",
    "strategy to escape from local minima .",
    "the algorithm was not specifically designed for cb - ctt but it was intended to be employed on all three tracks of itc-2007 ( including , besides cb - ctt and pe - ctt , also examination timetabling ) .",
    "the solver was the winner of two out of three competition tracks , and it was among the finalists in the third one .",
    "the _ adaptive tabu search _ proposed by @xcite follows a three stage scheme : in the initialization phase a feasible timetable is built using a fast heuristic ; then the intensification and diversification phases are alternated through an adaptive tabu search in order to reduce the violations of soft constraints .",
    "a novel hybrid metaheuristic technique , obtained by combining _",
    "electromagnetic - like mechanisms _ and the _ great deluge _ algorithm , was employed by @xcite who obtained high - quality results on both cb - ctt and pe - ctt testbeds .",
    "finally , @xcite investigated the search performance of different neighborhood relations typically used by local search algorithms to solve this problem .",
    "the neighborhoods are compared using different evaluation criteria , and new combinations of neighborhoods are explored and analyzed .",

    "subsequently , the authors propose a novel ip model @xcite based on the concept of `` supernode '' which was originally employed to model graph coloring problems .",
    "this new encoding has been applied to the cb - ctt benchmarks and was compared with the established two - index ip model .",
    "the results showed that the supernodes formulation is able to considerably reduce the computational time .",
    "lastly , the same authors propose a _",
    "branch - and - cut _ procedure @xcite aimed at computing lower bounds for various problem formulations .",
    "@xcite proposed an ip approach that decomposes the problem in two stages : the first aims at assigning courses to periods and mainly focuses on satisfying the hard constraints ; the second optimizes for the soft constraints and assigns lectures to rooms by solving a matching problem .",
    "@xcite developed a partition - based approach to compute lower bounds : the idea behind their method is to divide the original instance into sub - instances by means of an _ iterative tabu search _ procedure .",
    "afterwards , each subproblem is solved via an ip solver using the model proposed by @xcite ; a lower bound of the original instance is obtained by summing up the lower bound values of all these sub - instances .    a somewhat similar approach has been tried recently by @xcite , who instead exploit soft constraints for the sub - instance partitioning . after the partitioning phase , two separated problems are formulated as ips and then solved to optimality by a _",
    "column generation _ technique .",
    "@xcite employed several satisfiability ( sat ) models for tackling the cb - ctt problem that differ on which constraints are specifically considered soft or hard . using different encodings they were able to compute lower bounds and obtain new best solutions for the benchmarks .",
    "finally , @xcite translated the cb - ctt formulation into an answer set programming ( asp ) problem and solved it using the asp solver ` clasp ` .",
    "a summary of the results of the aforementioned literature is given in table  [ tab : lb ] , which reports the lower bounds for the instances of itc-2007 testbed ( named ` comp ` in the table ) .",
    "the results highlighted in boldface indicate the tightest lower bounds .",
    "note that these bounds were obtained using diverse experimental setups ( particularly time budgets ) and therefore should not be regarded as a fair comparison of methods , but rather as a record of the lower bounds available in literature . in the table we also report the best results known at the time of writing .",
    "best values marked with an asterisk are guaranteed optimal ( i.e. , they match the lower bound ) .",
    "we now discuss research activities on cb - ctt that consider other issues besides the solution to the original problem .",
    "the first issue concerns the development of instance generators . to the best of our knowledge , the first attempt to devise an instance generator for cb - ctt is due to @xcite , who tried to create instances that resemble the structure of the itc-2007 ` comp ` instances .",
    "that generator has been revised and improved by @xcite , who based their work on a deeper insight on the instance features and made their generator publicly available . for our experimental analysis we use the generator developed in the latter work .",
    "a further research issue concerns the investigation of the problem as a multi - objective one . to this regard , @xcite considered the cb - ctt problem as a multi - criteria decision problem , and studied the influence of the weighted - sum aggregation methodology on the performance of the technique .",
    "another issue related to multi - objective studies concerns the concept of _ fairness_. notably , in the standard single objective formulation , some curricula can be heavily penalized in the best result in favor of an overall high quality .",
    "@xcite studied this problem and considered various notions of fairness . moreover",
    ", they compared these notions in order to evaluate their effects with respect to the other objectives .",
    "we propose a solution method for the problem that is based on the well - known _ simulated annealing _",
    "metaheuristic @xcite .",
    "as it is customary for local search , in order to instantiate the abstract solution method to the problem at hand we must define a search space , a neighborhood relation , and a cost function .",
    "we consider the search space composed of all the assignments of lectures to rooms and periods for which the hard constraint is satisfied .",
    "hard constraints and are considered as components of the cost function and their violation is highly penalized .",
    "we employ two different basic neighborhood relations , defined by the set of solutions that can be reached by applying any of the following moves to a solution    : : :    change the period and the room of one lecture .",
    ": : :    swap the period and the room of two lectures of distinct courses .",
    "the two basic neighborhoods are merged in a composite neighborhood that considers the set union of and . however , according to the results of our previous study @xcite , we restrict the neighborhood so that only moves which place the lecture in an _ empty _ room are considered ( whenever possible , i.e. , when the room occupancy factor is less than @xmath0 , as there would be no empty rooms in such a case ) . moreover , our previous findings suggest employing a non - uniform probability for selecting the moves in the composed neighborhood . in detail , the move selection strategy consists of two stages : first the neighborhood is randomly selected with a non - uniform probability controlled by a parameter @xmath1 ( _ swap rate _ ) , then a random move in the selected neighborhood is uniformly drawn .",
    "the cost of a solution @xmath2 is a weighted sum of the violations of the hard constraints and and of the objectives ( i.e. , the measure of soft constraints violations )    @xmath3    where the weights @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined by the problem formulation , while @xmath7 is a parameter of the algorithm ( see section  [ sec : parameters ] ) .",
    "this value should be high enough to give precedence to feasibility over objectives , but it should not be so high as to allow the sa metaheuristic ( whose move acceptance criterion is based on the difference in the cost function between the current solution and the neighboring one ) to select also moves that could increase the number of violations in early stages of the search .      in a departure from our previous work @xcite , in which the metaheuristic that guides the search is a combination ( token - ring ) of tabu search and a `` standard '' version of sa , in this work we employ a single - stage enhanced version of the latter method .",
    "we show that this rather simple sa variant , once properly tuned , outperforms such a combination .",
    "the sa metaheuristic @xcite is a local search method based on a probabilistic acceptance criterion for non - improving moves .",
    "specifically , at each iteration a neighbor of the current solution is randomly selected and it is accepted if either    it improves the cost function value or ,    according to an exponential probability distribution that is biased by the amount of worsening and by a parameter @xmath8 called temperature    . besides the initialization functions ( setting the initial solution and fixing temperature @xmath9 ) , the main hot - spots of the method are the function for updating ( i.e. , decreasing ) the temperature and the stopping condition . in the standard variant of sa , the temperature update is performed at regular intervals ( i.e. , every @xmath10 iterations ) and the cooling scheme employed is a geometric one . that is , the temperature is decreased by multiplying it for a cooling factor @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , so that @xmath13 .",
    "the search is stopped when the temperature reaches a minimum value @xmath14 that will prevent accepting worsening solutions .",
    "the main differences between the sa approach implemented in this work and the one proposed in @xcite reside in a different specification of these two components . in this implementation",
    "we replace the standard functions with the following strategies    1 .",
    "[ search : cutoff ] a _ cutoff - based _ temperature cooling scheme @xcite ; 2 .   [ search : stopping ] a different _ stopping condition _ for the solver , based on the maximum number of allowed iterations .    in the following , we detail these two aspects of the sa method employed in this work .

    "this allows us to speed - up the initial part of the search , thus saving iterations that can be used in the final part , where intensification takes place .",

    "a possible limitation of this choice is that the temperature might still be too high when the budget runs out . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", we fix an _ expected _ minimum temperature @xmath14 to a reasonable value and we compute the number @xmath15 ( see equation  [ eqn : neighbors_sampled ] ) of solutions sampled at each temperature so that the minimum temperature is reached exactly when the maximum number of iterations is met .",
    "that is    @xmath18    because of the cutoff - based cooling scheme , at the beginning of the search the temperature might decrease before all @xmath15 solutions have been sampled .",
    "thus @xmath14 is reached in @xmath19 iterations in advance , where @xmath19 depends on the cost landscape and on the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "these spared iterations are exploited at the end of the search , i.e. , after @xmath14 has been reached , to carry out further intensification moves .    in order to simplify the parameters of the algorithm ,",
    "given the dependence of the cutoff - based scheme on the ratio @xmath21 and the relation @xmath22 , we decided to indirectly specify the value of the parameter @xmath23 by including a real - valued parameter @xmath24 $ ] defined as @xmath25 .",
    "our sa metaheuristic involves many parameters . in order to refrain from making any `` premature commitment '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider all of them in the experimental analysis .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tab : parameters ] , along with the ranges involved in the experimental analysis which have been fixed based on preliminary experiments .",
    "the iterations budget has been fixed , for each instance , to @xmath26 , a value that provides the algorithm with a running time which is approximately equivalent to the one allowed by itc-2007 computation rules ( namely 408 seconds on our test machine ) .",

    "those tables also show the results by @xcite , which are , to our knowledge , the only published results on these formulations .",
    "the comparison reveals that again fbt and f - race perform similarly , and that in general , they perform better than the solver by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a simple yet effective sa approach to the cb - ctt problem . moreover",
    ", we performed a comprehensive statistical analysis to identify the relationship between instance features and search method parameters .",
    "the outcome of this analysis makes it possible to set the parameters for unseen instances on the basis of a simple inspection of the instance itself .",
    "the results of the feature - based tuned algorithm on a testbed of _ validation _ instances allows us to improve our previous results @xcite and outperform the results in the literature on @xmath27 instances out of @xmath28 .    the results of this work support the conclusion that instance features may provide useful information for tuning the parameters of the solver .",
    "therefore , a sensible direction for future investigation may focus on refining this approach by exploring novel features obtained as functions , possibly complex in nature , of the original features .    in the future , we plan to investigate new versions of sa that could be applied to this problem .",
    "for example , we plan to consider the version that includes reheating .",
    "in addition , we plan to investigate other metaheuristics techniques for the problem through an analogous statistical analysis",
