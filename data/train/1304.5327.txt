    "in order to understand the interstellar processes which govern star formation , studies of the large scale properties of various star forming regions at different environments are very essential .",
    "census of young stellar objects ( ysos ) born in a cloud , their mass , age and spatial distribution , together with mass of the star forming cloud are some of the key data used for the assessment of the time scale and star formation history of a given region . however , identifying the member stars of a given young association is quite difficult .",
    "it is well known that ysos show excess emission in infra - red ( ir ) above main sequence ( ms ) photosphere due to thermal emission from their circumstellar material .",
    "thus , ysos can be identified by looking for ir excess emission .",
    "ysos are often categorized into class 0 , i , ii or iii evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "class 0 objects are deeply embedded protostars that are still experiencing cloud collapse .",
    "they are extremely faint at wavelengths shorter than 10 @xmath2 m and have a significant sub - millimeter luminosity .",
    "a class i yso is also an object whose emission is dominated by a dense infalling spherical envelope , however these objects are bright in the ir .",
    "a class ii yso is characterized by the presence of an optically thick , primordial circumstellar disk , which dominates the star s emission . when the circumstellar disk material becomes optically thin , the star is classified as a class iii star .",
    "hence , ir survey of a star forming region can be used as a powerful tool to distinguish the stars with ir excesses from stars without such excesses .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivity and mapping capabilities of the _ spitzer _ space telescope provides an excellent platform to survey the star forming regions in the mid - ir and to identify the ir excess sources in the region .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "spitzer _ data can also be used to classify ysos at different evolutionary stages , which helps us probing the recent star formation activity of a given region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "massive stars have a profound effect on their natal environment creating wind - blown shells , cavities and hii regions .",
    "the immense amount of energy released through their stellar winds and radiation disperse and destroy the remaining molecular gas and likely inhibit further star formation .",
    "however , it has also been argued that in some circumstances , the energy input by these massive stars can promote and induce subsequent low mass star formation in the surrounding molecular gas before it disperses ( e.g. , koenig et al .",
    "therefore , regions that contain massive stars provide excellent laboratories for studying both high and low mass star formation .",
    "identification and characterization of the ysos in star forming complexes hosting massive stars are essential steps to examine the physical processes that govern new generation star formation in such complexes .    here",
    "we present the results of our multi - wavelength analyses of the star forming complex sh2 - 252 ( @xcite ; @xmath3 = @xmath4 ; @xmath5 = @xmath6 ; l=190@xmath7.04 ; b=+0@xmath7.48 ) .",
    "sh2 - 252 is an evolved region powered by the central massive ionizing source of o6.5v type , hd 42088 , which is a member of the gemini ob1 association . the dss2-r band image of the region around sh2 - 252 for an area of @xmath0 1.3 @xmath8 1.3 deg@xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "radio observations at 5 ghz detected six extended sources ( sh2 - 252 a to f ) at different spatial locations towards the region , of which , four of them ( a , b , c and e ) are classified as compact ( c ) regions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar contents of this region were not so well explored until recently .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper 1 ) unraveled its stellar contents using deep optical , shallow near - infrared ( nir ; 2mass ) , @xmath10 survey along with spectroscopic observations .",
    "they estimated the distance ( 2.4 kpc ) , reddening and identified 12 ob stars of spectral type earlier than b8 , 61 @xmath10 emission line sources within the nebula and also 5 prominent embedded clusters associated with the sub - regions a , c , e , ngc 2175s and teu 136 .",
    "the age and age spread , initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath11-band luminosity function ( klf ) etc . of the sub - regions",
    "have also been discussed in paper 1 .",
    "the main sub - regions of sh2 - 252 such as a , b , c , e , f , ngc 2175s and teu 136",
    "are marked in fig .",
    "sh2 - 252 is bounded by an ionization front ( if ) on the west side , while it is density bounded on the east side @xcite .",
    "the detailed @xmath12co and @xmath13co maps of the region by @xcite showed that the cloud complex is separated into two fragments by a long rift of little co emission and named them as western cloud fragment ( wcf ) and eastern cloud fragment ( ecf ) , respectively , and are marked in fig .",
    "most of the mass of wcf is concentrated in a narrow ridge which borders the if of sh2 - 252 at its west ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity in the kinematics of these two cloud fragments shows that they belong to the same cloud complex and ecf probably lies at the back edge of the region , though it is projected very close to the ionizing source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most intense co peak of the wcf is located very close to region a , with water and methanol maser emissions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) within its proximity , suggesting recent star formation activity towards this region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an extensive overview of the previous studies of sh2 - 252 can be found in paper 1 .",
    "this work is the continuation of paper 1 , where we have focused mainly on the characteristics of the ysos in the sh2 - 252 complex for the first time and to constrain the star formation history of the complex .",
    "we used the optical , 2mass-@xmath14 , _",
    "spitzer_- irac and mips data sets to identify and classify the ysos of sh2 - 252 region .",
    "an attempt has also been made to characterize the physical properties of the ysos based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) analyses .",
    "section 2 describes various data sets used for the present study .",
    "analyses and results including the identification and classification of ysos , their various properties such as ages , masses , seds , spatial distribution etc . have been discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 deals with discussion on the morphology and star formation scenario of the complex and finally summary of the paper is presented in section 5 .",
    "two sets of irac observations in 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands ( channels 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) were available in the _ spitzer _ space observatory archive program ( program ids : 201 ; 20506 , pis : g. fazio ; j. hester ) which were taken towards wcf and ecf on 2004 october 28 and 2006 march 26 , respectively .",
    "the irac data were taken in the high dynamic range mode with three dithers per map position and with integration time of 0.4 sec and 10.4 sec per dither .",
    "we downloaded the basic calibrated data images ( versions s18.7.0 and s18.5.0 ) from the _ spitzer _ archive and the raw data were processed and calibrated with the irac pipeline .",
    "the final mosaics were created using the mopex pipeline ( version 18.0.1 ) with an image scale of 1@xmath15.2 per pixel . the total area covered by these two observations is marked in fig . [ area ] by using a dashed box .",
    "we performed the point response function ( prf ) fitting method in multiframe mode using the tool apex developed by _",
    "science center on all the _",
    "spitzer_-irac images to extract the magnitudes .",
    "the standard prfmap table provided on the _ spitzer _ website were used to fit variable prfs across the image .",
    "point sources with peak values more than 5@xmath16 above the background were considered candidate detection .",
    "many sources detected in the nebulosity were appeared to be spurious .",
    "the spurious sources were identified visually and deleted from the automated detection list . also , some of the sources were not detected by apex automatically .",
    "we identified these sources visually and added the coordinates in the user - list mode in apex to extract the magnitudes and thus we made sure that photometry of every genuine source is derived .",
    "we have adopted the zero - points for conversion between flux densities and magnitudes to be 280.9 , 179.7 , 115.0 and 64.1 jy in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands , respectively , following the irac data handbook .",
    "there were signs of saturation of bright sources in the long integrated images .",
    "the photometric data derived from the short images were replaced for the saturated sources .",
    "the two sets of irac observations had substantial overlapping between the regions and we used the average magnitudes of those common sources detected in both the observations .",
    "channels 3 and 4 detected far fewer sources than channels 1 and 2 .",
    "this deficit exists because channels 1 and 2 are more sensitive than channels 3 and 4 and are also less affected by the bright diffuse emission that dominates the channel 3 and 4 images .",
    "the underlying typical stellar photosphere is also intrinsically fainter at channels 3 and 4 than at channels 1 and 2 , which further hinders the ability to detect sources in the longer wavelength irac filters .",
    "we finally obtained extraction lists of 24877 , 20591 , 5083 and 3263 sources in the irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands , respectively , within the area shown in fig .",
    "the irac data of the four band passes were merged , by matching the coordinates using a radial matching tolerance of 1@xmath15.2 . to ensure good photometric accuracy , we restricted our catalog with sources having uncertainty @xmath17 0.2 mag in all the bands .",
    "thus our final irac catalog contains photometry of 31251 sources which were detected in one or more irac bands . out of these",
    ", only 1988 sources were detected in all the irac bands .",
    "the areas towards wcf and ecf were observed at 24 @xmath2 m using the multi - band imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) on 2006 october 13 and 2008 october 25 ( program ids : 20726 ; 50758 , pis : j. hester ; m. m. drosback ) .",

    "is marked in fig .",
    "the sources were identified visually and their coordinates were given in the user - list mode in apex . to extract the flux",
    ", we performed the prf fitting method in the single frame mode .",
    "the zero - point value of 7.14 jy from the mips data handbook has been used to convert flux densities to magnitudes .",
    "the final catalog contains the 24 @xmath2 m photometry of 646 sources having uncertainty @xmath17 0.2 mag .",
    "we cross - correlated our mips-24",
    "@xmath2 m catalog with the source catalog of irac , using a 2@xmath15.5 matching radius .",
    "we obtained 24 @xmath2 m counterparts for 428 sources with irac data in all the bands .",
    "the 24 @xmath2 m photometry was mainly used to classify the ysos and to analyze their seds ( see section [ sed ] ) .",
    "nir @xmath14 data for point sources within a radius of 30 arcmin around hd 42088 have been obtained from 2mass point source catalog ( psc ) @xcite . to improve the photometric accuracy , we used the data with photometric quality flag ( ph@xmath18qual = aaa ) which gives a s / n @xmath19 10 and a photometric uncertainty @xmath20 0.1 mag .",
    "this selection criterion ensures best quality detection in terms of photometry and astrometry as given on the 2mass website .",
    "we used 2mass data along with _",
    "spitzer_-irac data to identify and classify the candidate ysos within sh2 - 252 ( see section [ yso_2mass ] ) .",
    "the nir and irac sources were bandmerged within @xmath21.2 radial matching tolerance .",
    "if more than one 2mass sources satisfied this requirement , then the nearest one was selected .",
    "thus we obtained a total of 9097 2mass sources having irac counterpart at least in one band .",
    "a colour composite image using the 3.6 , 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands of _ spitzer_-irac is shown in fig .",
    "[ color - irac ] .",
    "the important sub - regions and the ionizing source ( hd 42088 ) of sh2 - 252 are marked in the figure .",
    "different irac bands have contribution from various extended emission features .",
    "for example , 3.6 @xmath2 m band is dominated by diffuse emission from the 3.3 @xmath2 m pah feature .",
    "the 4.5 @xmath2 m band includes the @xmath22 line plus co band head emission and @xmath23 lines , and 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands are dominated by strong pah features , although a few sources show extended thermal continuum emissions from warm circumstellar dust in these bands @xcite .",
    "pahs are believed to be destroyed in the ionized gas and thought to be excited in the photon dominated region ( pdr ) that is situated at the interface of region and molecular cloud by the absorption of far - uv photons leaking from the region @xcite .",
    "therefore pahs are good tracers of the warm pdr that surrounds the region .",
    "the most striking feature in fig .",
    "[ color - irac ] is the magenta coloured emission that appears almost semi - circular in shape towards the west of sh2 - 252 .",
    "the pahs within the pdr re - emit their energy in the 3.6 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands , and this can be seen as magenta coloured emission in the colour composite image given in fig .",
    "[ color - irac ] .",
    "altogether , this image shows a bubble - like emission feature around the ionizing source hd 42088 , likely to be created due to the expansion of the region to its surroundings . the bright - rim feature discussed in section [ intro ] ( i.e. , region f ; see also fig",
    ". 2 of paper 1 for a close - up view ) coincides well with the pah emission feature seen at the southwest of fig .",
    "[ color - irac ] , with a sharp edge pointing towards hd 42088 .",
    "this sharp edge indicates the if , that coincides with the molecular ridge seen in the @xmath12co map shown in fig .",
    "[ area ] as well as the extinction map shown in fig .",
    "[ extmap ] ( see section [ kextmap ] ) .",
    "this correlation indicates the interface of the ionized and molecular gas .",
    "the correlation of the half - ring structure of pah emission towards the west of sh2 - 252 with the @xmath12co emission and extinction maps indicates that the ionized gas is separated from the molecular cloud by the neutral gas with pah emission .",
    "the absence of 8 @xmath2 m emission in the interior of the region can be interpreted as the destruction of pah molecules by the intense uv radiation of the ionizing source .",
    "there is also less intense diffuse emission towards the east of sh2 - 252 .",
    "however , the ionized gas is bounded more extensively in the western direction than in the eastern direction .",
    "it is to be noted that the location of ngc 2175s is devoid of strong pah emission features .",
    "interestingly , another bright red emission knot is seen further towards east of ngc 2175s with a bright red point source inside it .",
    "a small clustering is evident further east to this point source which coincides with the sub - region teu 136 discussed in paper 1 .",
    "there are not many studies on this group of stars in the literature .",
    "however , based on our spectral analysis in paper 1 , we concluded that this group is a part of the main sh2 - 252 complex itself .",
    "the indication of variable extinction in the sh2 - 252 region has been discussed in paper 1 based on the optical photometric analyses of the bright stars as well as from the distribution of candidate ysos on the @xmath24 colour - colour ( c - c ) diagram . in order to quantify the amount of extinction within each sub - region of sh2 - 252 and to characterize the structure of molecular clouds",
    ", we derived the @xmath25 extinction map using the @xmath26 colours of the stars in the 2mass catalog . to improve the quality of the map ,",
    "the candidate ysos and probable contamination sources ( see section [ yso ] ) were excluded from the list .",
    "we used the grid method to determine the mean value of @xmath25 .",
    "briefly , we divided the sh2 - 252 region into many grids of size @xmath27 , and the median value of @xmath26 colours of all the sources within each grid was measured .",
    "the sources deviating above 3@xmath16 were excluded to calculate the final median colour of each grid .",
    "we used the reddening law by @xcite to convert @xmath26 colour in to @xmath25 , using the relation @xmath25 = 1.82 @xmath8 @xmath28 , where , @xmath29 = 0.2 is assumed as an average intrinsic colour of stars in young clusters ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since this complex is situated at a distance of 2.4 kpc ( paper 1 ) , the contribution from the foreground field stars would have affected the present extinction measurements .",
    "an average foreground extinction of @xmath30= 1.5 mag has been estimated towards this region in paper 1 .",
    "therefore , to eliminate the foreground contribution in the extinction measurement , we used only those stars with @xmath25 @xmath31 0.15 mag to generate the extinction map .",
    "there were an average of five sources in each grid to calculate the median colour .",
    "the final extinction map , having an angular resolution of @xmath32 , which is sensitive down to @xmath30 = 16 mag is shown in fig .",
    "[ extmap ] . however , it has to be kept in mind that this map is limited by the sensitivity of the 2mass survey . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath25 value derived may be underestimated due to the small number of background stars detected in the heavily extincted area of the complex .",
    "it is interesting to note that the extinction map derived from the @xmath26 colours shown in fig .",
    "[ extmap ] resembles the general distribution of the molecular cloud as outlined by the @xmath12co emission map shown in fig .",
    "it traces the presence of molecular cloud towards the sub - regions a , b , c and nicely follows the bright rim feature visible at the west of sh2 - 252 ( i.e. , region f , see fig . 2 of paper 1 ) similar to the ridge of molecular cloud seen in the @xmath12co emission map by @xcite .",
    "similarly , the separation between the two cloud fragments wcf and ecf ( see section [ intro ] ) by the long rift of less extinction is also clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ extmap ] .",
    "the western cloud portion is more extincted as compared to the eastern one .",
    "however , isolated extinction complexes are seen in the eastern side as well .",
    "it has to be noted that the locations of the clusters ngc 2175s and teu 136 are devoid of heavy reddening .",
    "the same trend has already been noticed in paper 1 .",
    "the average extinction @xmath30 of the four optically bright members of the cluster ngc 2175s ( see table 3 of paper 1 ) is @xmath0 2.2 mag , which is significantly lower than the extinction towards the western part of the complex .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that the strong stellar winds from the four early type sources in ngc 2175s would have removed the dust and gas from its neighborhood or the region could be more evolved than the other parts of the complex .      in the ensuing sections , we identify and classify the ysos within sh2 - 252 mainly into class i and class ii categories using their ir colours .",
    "we do not classify diskless class iii ysos because they are indistinguishable from field stars based on their ir colours and hence we can not reliably identify them using the current data set . the main limitation of the identification of ysos based on their ir colours is the contamination from various non - stellar sources in irac detection such as , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emitting galaxies , broad - line active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , unresolved knots of shock emission , pah - emission contaminated apertures etc . , which have colours similar to that of ysos and may lead to wrong identification of ysos .",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduced the classification criteria for ysos using the ( @xmath33-[4.5]$ ] , @xmath34-[8.0]$ ] ) c - c diagram .",
    "these colour criteria since then have been modified by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we adopted the empirical three - phase scheme introduced by @xcite to identify the ysos with ir excess in this complex .",
    "briefly , in phase 1 , after excluding the non - stellar contamination ( see section [ yso_irac ] ) , all four irac bands are used to separate the sources with ir excesses due to disks and envelopes ( class ii and class i , respectively ) from pure photospheres ( class iii / field stars ) based on [ 3.6 ] - [ 5.8 ] and [ 4.5 ] - [ 8.0 ] colours .",
    "phase 2 is applied to those sources which lack irac detection at [ 5.8 ] or [ 8.0 ] @xmath2 m , but which have high - quality 2mass detection ( @xmath35 0.1 mag ) in at least @xmath36 and @xmath11 bands .",
    "sources are then classified as class ii or class i objects based on their de - reddened ( @xmath37-[3.6])_0 $ ] and @xmath38-[4.5])_0 $ ] ) colours @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are a few objects with nir+irac colours of class iiis , but which exhibit a 24 @xmath2 m excess .",
    "these objects are included in a new class of ysos i.e. , ` transition disk ' sources .",
    "phase 3 re - examines all sources including contaminants and identifies class i objects and transition disk objects on the basis of their mips 24 @xmath2 m photometry .      in order to identify the ysos by their irac colours",
    ", we used only those sources detected in all the irac bands with photometric uncertainties less than 0.2 magnitude .",
    "various non - stellar contaminating sources mentioned above are eliminated by using several criteria described in detail by @xcite . out of the 1988 sources detected in all the irac channels ,",
    "444 sources are found to be contaminants .",
    "the remaining sample of 1544 sources was used to identify the class i and class ii ysos associated with the region using the irac colour criteria given by @xcite .",
    "the above criteria yields 340 ysos with ir excess emission , with 86 and 254 sources having colours consistent with class i and class ii types , respectively .",
    "the rest could be class iii / field stars , which we are unable to classify reliably based on their irac colours .",
    "however , it is to be noted that in a few cases , highly reddened class ii sources could mimic the colours of class i source @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ irac - cc ] ( left panel ) , we have shown the @xmath33-[4.5]$ ] vs @xmath34-[8.0]$ ] c - c diagram for all the uncontaminated irac sources , where the class i and class ii sources are shown as red squares and green triangles , respectively .",
    "here we would like to point out that the present yso selection based on the irac- four colour detection is not complete , as many sources falling in the bright nebulous regions were not detected in the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands .",
    "the detection of class i and class ii ysos in all the four irac bands is limited mainly by the lower sensitivity and enhanced nebulosity of the [ 5.6 ] and [ 8.0 ] @xmath2 m bands . in order to account for the ysos missing in these bands",
    ", we used @xmath36 , @xmath11 , [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] @xmath2 m data sets and the additional ysos in the complex are identified .",
    "@xcite used the dereddened colour criteria to identify such ysos .",
    "we used the extinction map ( see fig .",
    "[ extmap ] ; section [ kextmap ] ) to deredden the data . to minimize the inclusion of extra - galactic contaminants",
    ", we applied a simple brightness limit in the dereddened [ 3.6 ] @xmath2 m photometry i.e. , all the class i ysos must have @xmath33_0 \\le$ ] 15 mag and all the class ii ysos must have @xmath33_0 \\le$ ] 14.5 mag @xcite .",
    "thus , after removing the contaminants and using the @xcite colour criteria , we identified a total of 367 candidate ysos ( 67 class i ; 300 class ii ) with ir excess emission , of which , 211 ( 52 class i and 159 class ii ) are found to be common with the ysos identified using the irac four - colour criteria ( see section [ yso_irac ] ) .",
    "finally , we obtained 15 and 141 additional ysos having colours consistent with class i and class ii , respectively using the @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] colour combination . in fig .",

    "in order to identify the transition disk sources , we re - examined the entire catalog of sources having 24 @xmath2 m counterparts and with uncertainty less than 0.2 mag .",
    "those sources that were considered photospheric in the previous classification but have significant excess emission at 24 @xmath2 m ( i.e. , [ 5.8]-[24 ] @xmath31 2.5 mag or [ 4.5]-[24 ] @xmath31 2.5 mag ) are typically known as transition disks .",
    "they are the class ii sources with significant dust clearing within their inner disks @xcite and we identified 14 such sources within the complex .",
    "also , any source which lacks detection in some irac bands yet has bright 24 @xmath2 m photometry are likely to be deeply embedded protostars .",
    "we identified 67 such sources and those are included in the class i category in the following analysis .",
    "five sources which lacked strong 24 @xmath2 m detection but had been classified as class i ysos in the previous step ( section [ yso_irac ] ) are reclassified as heavily reddened class ii ysos .",
    "thus after reclassifying the sources using the 24 @xmath2 m photometry , we have finally identified 577 ysos with ir excess emission in the sh2 - 252 complex . of these , 163 are consistent with class i , 400 are consistent with class ii and 14 are consistent with transition disk ysos . these objects will be used in the following analysis .",
    "thus the sh2 - 252 complex seems to have moderately rich number of ysos . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ irac - cc ] we have shown the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs [ 8.0]-[24 ] c - c diagram of all the uncontaminated irac sources having counterparts in 24 @xmath2 m along with the candidate class i , class ii and transition disk sources marked in red squares , green triangles and magenta circles , respectively .",
    "to evaluate the completeness of the census of irac detection quantitatively , we plot histograms of the irac sources having error @xmath43 0.2 mag for all the channels and they are shown by using solid lines in fig . [ comp ] . in general , the data can be considered complete till the linear distribution in the histograms which are found to be 16.5 , 16.0 , 14.0 and 13.0 mag for 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath2 m bands , respectively . however , the completeness of the yso census is limited by many factors .",
    "bright extended , variable nebulosity in the irac bands can be found across the region , which significantly limits the point source detection in these areas .",
    "the yso identification from the 2mass- irac colours is limited by the modest sensitivity of the 2mass survey , while that from the irac - mips colours suffer from the significant saturation in the irac 8 @xmath2 m and mips 24 @xmath2 m images caused by the central luminous sources as well as bright nebulosity .",
    "similarly the variable reddening ( see fig . [ extmap ] ) and stellar crowding characteristics across the extend of the region ( see paper 1 ) could also affect the local completeness limit .",
    "completeness limits for the _ spitzer _ photometry were also assessed by using a method of inserting artificial stars into the mosaics and then employing our detection algorithms to identify them ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the water and methanol maser emissions associated with 850 @xmath2 m and co peak towards the east of region a suggests that this region is possibly at an early evolutionary stage than a.    the high concentration of class i ysos around the region a ( fig .",

    "based on the class i / ii ratio and age histogram analysis , the regions b , c and e are found to be at a similar evolutionary stage and are slightly evolved ( median age @xmath0 1 - 2 myr ) than region a. the presence of a very few number of ysos towards the small cluster ngc 2175s ( see fig .",
    "[ spatial ] ) suggests that either the cluster was formed in an early epoch of star formation in sh2 - 252 or it is a case of rapid circumstellar disk evolution of ysos ( e.g. , @xcite ) due to the presence of four early type massive sources at its center ( see table 4 of paper 1 ) .",

    "@xcite showed that the cloud complex is separated mainly into two fragments ecf and wcf , which themselves are embedded in a more diffuse and extended ( @xmath0 90 pc ) molecular cloud complex .",
    "most of the mass of wcf ( @xmath0 2.5 @xmath8 10@xmath69 ) is concentrated in a narrow ridge , which borders the western if of sh2 - 252 .",
    "this dense , semi - circular shaped shell observed at the eastern boundary of wcf , appears to have been swept up by the pressure from the if generated by the exciting source of sh2 - 252 @xcite .",

    "thus it is suggested that at least part of the shell in wcf is probably primordial in nature and the entire shell is not swept up by the expansion of the region .",

    "[ color - irac ] that the region is in interaction with wcf , with bright semi - circular pdr and compressed neutral material behind it and protruding structures such as ` finger tips ' and a bright rim pointing towards the ionizing source . moreover , we observed recent star formation activity towards this region .",

    "hence the influence of o6.5v star to region a , if at all exists , must be weak .",
    "in general , the configuration ( at least in the western direction ) suggests that the region has collected some of the matter during its expansion at its periphery , like the collect & collapse process of star formation such as in sh2 - 212 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "thus , if they are evolved in a cloud clump of similar density , the larger size of region b possibly reflects that it is relatively evolved in nature .",
    "the region between a and b indeed reflects a site of recent star formation , where much younger sources are found in the matter in between the two relatively evolved cregions a and b. a similar kind of star formation has been observed at the interfaces of two expanding super giant shells lmc4 and lmc5 @xcite and two classical regions s255-s257 @xcite , where it is believed that collision of dense swept up neutral materials associated with individual shells lead to star formation ( @xcite ) .",

    "the overall picture emerges from our analyses is that the star formation activity observed towards wcf is more likely multi - fold and the sources are found to be at different evolutionary stages . though the large scale co map @xcite provides much information about the global structure of the complex , but the region certainly deserves attention for high resolution molecular line observations to explore the detailed properties of the sub - regions .",
