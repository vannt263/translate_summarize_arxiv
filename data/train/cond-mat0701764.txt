    "since the experimental realization of the first dilute bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of trapped atomic gases @xcite there has been great interest in the study of the physical properties of ultracold quantum gases @xcite . under the usual experimental conditions , these systems can be accurately described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite , a mean - field equation of motion governing the behavior of the condensate wave function @xmath0 . in the stationary case",
    "the gpe is given by the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the chemical potential , @xmath3 is the number of atoms , @xmath4 is the interaction strength , determined by the _ s_-wave scattering length @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the trap potential .    in this work",
    "we shall concentrate in the usual case of condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions ( @xmath7 ) , confined in cylindrically symmetric harmonic traps , @xmath8 .    to obtain the condensate ground - state properties one has to solve the nonlinear differential equation ( [ eqgp ] ) .",
    "no explicit analytical solutions are known , so that , in general , this has to be done numerically . however , solving numerically the 3d gpe is a nontrivial computational task , especially for highly asymmetric trap geometries , where large basis or gridpoint sets can be required to guarantee convergence .",
    "fortunately , approximate analytical solutions can be found in certain limiting cases . in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) regime , which essentially occurs for condensates with a large number of atoms",
    ", the kinetic energy can be neglected to a good approximation . in this case",
    "the gpe reduces to a simple algebraic equation and one can obtain explicit analytical expressions for the condensate ground - state properties @xcite .",
    "this approximation , however , can not reproduce correctly the decay of the wave function at the boundary of the atomic cloud , a region where the kinetic energy has a decisive influence .",
    "corrections to the tf approximation have been proposed to account for the proper behavior of the density cloud at the condensate surface @xcite . in the  ( ideal gas )",
    "perturbative regime , when the number of atoms in the condensate is sufficiently small , explicit analytical expressions can also be obtained by treating the interaction energy term in eq .",
    "( [ eqgp ] ) as a weak perturbation .",
    "another approximation scheme that has proved to be useful  in the characterization of dilute becs is that based on variational techniques @xcite .",
    "this approximation method has the additional interest that it can be equally applied to the study of the condensate dynamics @xcite . by using appropriate variational trial wave functions ,",
    "the ground - state properties of trapped bose - condensed gases have been studied beyond the two analytically solvable regimes , for both isotropic @xcite and highly anisotropic condensates @xcite . for this purpose",
    "semiclassical approximations ( @xmath9 ) have also been considered @xcite .",
    "these approximate methods can be applied to the study of vortex states as well @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the physical properties of quasi-1d @xcite and quasi-2d @xcite condensates , systems so tightly confined in the radial or the axial dimension , respectively , that the corresponding dynamics is restricted to zero - point oscillations .    in a previous work , by modifying the usual tf approximation conveniently , we derived very accurate approximate analytical expressions for the ground - state properties of trapped spherical , cigar - shaped , and disk - shaped condensates with an arbitrary number of atoms in the mean - field regime @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend our previous results and derive general approximate formulas that provide with remarkable accuracy the ground - state properties of any mean - field scalar bose - einstein condensate with short - range repulsive interatomic interactions , confined in arbitrary cylindrically symmetric harmonic traps , and even containing a multiply quantized axisymmetric vortex .",
    "we consider a bec with an axisymmetric vortex line of topological charge @xmath10 , and confined in a harmonic trap characterized by oscillator lengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the trap aspect ratio is given by @xmath13 . in this work",
    "we shall distinguish between ground and vortex states only through the value of the vortex charge .",
    "accordingly , we shall refer to the lowest - energy state of the condensate compatible with an axisymmetric vortex of charge @xmath10 as the ground - state with a charge-@xmath10 vortex .",
    "this terminology will permit us to make a unified treatment in which the actual ground state of the condensate is simply a particular case corresponding to @xmath14 .    for condensates with a sufficiently small number of atoms",
    "the mean - field interaction energy can be treated as a weak perturbation . in this perturbative regime",
    "the condensate wave function that minimizes the energy functional is given , to the lowest order , by@xmath15 with@xmath16@xmath17 using this result one obtains the following analytical expression for the chemical potential:@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mean atom density and the coefficient @xmath20 is a function of the vortex charge that takes values in the interval @xmath21 and accounts for the dilution effect that the centrifugal force associated with the vortex has on the condensate mean density@xmath22 for @xmath14 one has @xmath23 , and the usual results for the ground - state properties of a bec in the perturbative regime are recovered . for a unit charge vortex",
    "the dilution coefficient  takes the value @xmath24 , and , in general , for @xmath25 , it decreases slowly as @xmath26 .    in the thomas - fermi regime , for condensates in the ground state @xmath27 and with a sufficiently large number of atoms",
    ", one can neglect the kinetic energy in comparison with the interaction energy , and the stationary gpe leads to@xmath28    in the presence of a vortex of charge @xmath29 the above equation is no longer a good approximation . in this case neglecting the kinetic energy amounts to neglecting the vortex itself .",
    "however , for a large @xmath3 , the condensate density cloud outside the vortex core is still given , to a very good approximation , by the thomas - fermi profile .",
    "we thus shall assume the above tf expression to be valid up to a lower cutoff radius@xmath30 determined from the condition that , in the presence of a vortex , the contribution from the radial harmonic oscillator energy can not be smaller than @xmath31 , i.e.,@xmath32 likewise , the contribution from the axial harmonic oscillator energy should  not be smaller than the corresponding zero - point energy . to account for this fact we introduce a second cutoff @xmath33 , defined through the condition@xmath34 which yields the axial cutoff@xmath35 this leads us to consider the tf expression ( [ eq5 ] ) applicable in a volume @xmath36 that corresponds to the usual tf ellipsoidal density cloud truncated at both @xmath37 and @xmath38,@xmath39    in the above equation @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the usual tf values for the condensate radius and axial half - length , respectively . in our approach , however , the condensate radius and axial half - length do not coincide with the above tf expressions . because of the cutoffs we have introduced they are given instead by@xmath42@xmath43 however , when @xmath44 , then @xmath45 becomes indistinguishable from @xmath46 .",
    "this is true , in particular , whenever @xmath47 . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 .    more generally , for condensates with @xmath44 , which occurs whenever @xmath47 , the relative contribution to the condensate properties coming from the region @xmath50 becomes negligible .",
    "the same occurs with the relative contribution from the region corresponding to @xmath51 when the chemical potential is much larger than the axial zero - point energy , which occurs whenever @xmath52 .",
    "it is then clear that when the number of atoms is sufficiently large that @xmath53 the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath36 volume introduced above .    only for condensates with @xmath54",
    "is the contribution from the region @xmath55  the most significant one .",
    "these are condensates with the transverse dynamics frozen in the lowest energy state compatible with a charge-@xmath10 axisymmetric vortex . in this case",
    "the condensate wave function can be factorized as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2a ] ) . after substituting this wave function in the stationary gpe , multiplying by @xmath58 , and integrating over the radial dynamics , one obtains@xmath59 where @xmath60 , and",
    "we have neglected the axial kinetic energy ( @xmath61 ) against @xmath62 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite @xmath63 as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 $ ]  is a uniform mean density per unit area normalized to unity in the region @xmath55 , and@xmath66 is the appropriate renormalization factor .",
    "the important point is that the effect of the vortex can be incorporated in an exact manner into a localized uniform mean density @xmath67 with a renormalized interaction strength @xmath68 .",
    "we shall assume that , to a good approximation , this still remains true for condensates with an arbitrary chemical potential .",
    "on the other hand , the contribution from the region @xmath51 is the most significant one only for condensates with @xmath69 . in this case",
    "the axial dynamics is restricted to zero - point oscillations , and the wave function of such quasi-2d condensates can be written as @xmath70 , where now @xmath71 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2b ] ) . substituting into the stationary gpe and integrating out the axial dynamics one obtains@xmath72 where @xmath73 , and",
    "now we have neglected the radial kinetic energy against the axial zero - point energy , which is a good approximation as long as @xmath74 .",
    "as before , it is convenient to rewrite @xmath75 in terms of a uniform mean density per unit length normalized to unity in the volume @xmath51 . to this end",
    "we introduce a renormalization factor @xmath76 and rewrite @xmath75 as @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "this indicates that the contribution from the axial zero - point oscillations , which is the dominant contribution in these quasi-2d condensates , can be properly accounted for by simply introducing a localized uniform mean density per unit length with a renormalized interaction strength .",
    "again , we shall assume this to be also valid for condensates with an arbitrary chemical potential .",
    "one finds , however , that somewhat more accurate results are obtained when one lets the renormalization factor @xmath79 to approach unity in the tf regime @xcite .",
    "since the final results are little sensitive to the specific functional form of @xmath79 , we propose one of the simplest possibilities @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the step function , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the tf radius .    motivated by the above ideas and the fact that there exists a direct relation between the number of atoms and the size of a trapped bec , we propose the following ansatz for the ground - state properties of any mean - field scalar bose - einstein condensate with an axisymmetric vortex of charge @xmath10 , confined in an arbitrary axisymmetric harmonic trap:@xmath84 with @xmath85 elsewhere . in the above equations @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , respectively .",
    "as already seen , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , whereas @xmath92 is an effective mean density ( per unit volume ) localized in @xmath93 and defined in terms of @xmath2 through the above expressions .",
    "note that @xmath94 is exactly the renormalization constant required to make the latter of the above equations compatible with the other ones as well as with the perturbative result ( [ eq3 ] ) . the outer volume @xmath36 is defined by eq .",

    "all that is needed is to solve the quintic polynomial equation ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "this is a general equation that provides the axial half - length @xmath115 of any mean - field scalar condensate as a function of only three parameters : the interaction parameter @xmath104 , the trap aspect ratio @xmath116 , and the vortex charge @xmath10 .",
    "in certain particular cases it is possible to find useful approximate analytical solutions .",

    "the model presented in this work is essentially a convenient approximation method motivated by two simple ideas : ( i ) there exists a direct relation between the number of particles and the size of a trapped bec and ( ii ) the contribution from the harmonic oscillator energy to the chemical potential can not be smaller than the zero - point energy . applying these simple ideas one finds useful formulas of great generality that provide the condensate ground - state properties in terms of the correct physically relevant magnitudes .",
    "moreover , even though no freely adjustable parameters are introduced , in all cases the formulas obtained reproduce simultaneously with a remarkable accuracy the condensate chemical potential and the interaction energy and , as a consequence , the kinetic and the potential energy as well . and",
    "this is true for mean - field condensates with any number of particles , confined in any axisymmetric harmonic trap , and even containing an axisymmetric vortex ."
