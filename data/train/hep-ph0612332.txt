    "the spectroscopy of states containing heavy quarks @xmath0 has undergone a great renaissance in recent years , providing an exceptional window into tests of qcd .",
    "quarkonium systems @xmath1 are amenable to perturbative descriptions of their decays .",
    "one can study @xmath2 and @xmath3 hadrons ( @xmath4 = light quark @xmath5 ) in which the heavy quarks play the role of `` nuclei , '' expanding observables in inverse powers of @xmath6 .",
    "many heavy - quark hadrons have masses and couplings strongly affected by nearby thresholds , as has been known for many years in the physics of atoms and nuclei .",
    "hadron spectra often are crucial in separating electroweak physics from strong - interaction effects .",
    "more broadly , qcd may not be the only instance of important non - perturbative effects .",
    "understanding how such effects are manifested in hadrons may help prepare us for surprises at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "finally , at the quark and lepton level there exists an intricate level structure and a set of transitions calling for fundamental understanding ; spectroscopic methods may help .",
    "we begin this brief review by outlining some theoretical spectroscopic methods .",
    "we then discuss charmed and beauty hadrons , heavy quarkonium ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , and future prospects .",
    "at large distances when the qcd coupling constant becomes too large to permit the use of perturbation theory , one can place quark and gluon degrees of freedom on a space - time lattice .",
    "an accurate description of the heavy quarkonium spectrum then can be obtained once one takes account of degrees of freedom associated with the pair production of light ( @xmath5 ) quarks @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd was applied to charmonium shortly after the discovery of asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "it describes @xmath7 decays reasonably well and does better for @xmath9 decays , where relativistic corrections are smaller @xcite .    at low energies neither lattice nor perturbative methods",
    "are appropriate for multiparticle systems .",
    "older techniques of chiral dynamics , unitarity , and crossing symmetry provide valuable insights for describing dynamics of mesons up to the gev scale and baryons somewhat higher .",
    "hadrons with one charmed or beauty quark can be regarded as `` atoms '' of qcd , with the light - quark and gluonic degrees of freedom playing the role of the electron(s ) and the heavy quark playing the role of the nucleus .",
    "properties of these systems tend to be very simple under the interchange @xmath10 , in the manner of isotope effects in nuclei .",
    "this _ heavy quark symmetry _ has led to a number of successful mass and coupling relations .    for charmonium , and more quantitatively for bottomonium , states may be described as bound by a potential whose short - distance behavior is approximately coulombic and whose long - distance behavior is linear to account for quark confinement .",
    "such potential models , often supplemented by relativistic and/or coupled - channel corrections , provide approximate descriptions for masses , leptonic partial widths , and hyperfine and fine - structure splittings .    one can reproduce the spectrum of hadrons containing the @xmath11 , and @xmath12 quarks with a model based on additive quark masses @xmath13 and hyperfine interactions proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "the masses of these `` constituent '' quarks are due in large part to their interaction with the surrounding gluon field .",
    "correlations between quarks ( `` diquarks '' ) also may be important in such descriptions .",
    "because of its increased coupling strength at long distances , qcd leads to the formation of condensates , including non - zero expectation values of color singlet quark - antiquark pairs and gluonic configurations such as instantons . a systematic attempt to cope with the effect of these condensates on hadron spectroscopy relies on qcd sum rules .",
    "various phenomenological methods exist for treating resonance decays .",
    "these mostly rely either on the notion that a single quark in a resonance undergoes a transition such as pion or photon emission , or the creation of a @xmath15 pair corresponding to the breaking of a flux tube connecting constituents of the resonance .    as this review emphasizes the variety of new experimental data on heavy - quark spectroscopy seeking theoretical explanation , it will concentrate on schemes such as lattice and perturbative qcd which have had the greatest predictive power .",

    "one expects 1s , 2s , and 3s hyperfine splittings to be approximately 60 , 30 , 20 mev/@xmath84 , respectively @xcite . the lowest p - wave singlet state ( `` @xmath305 '' ) is expected to be near @xmath306 mev/@xmath84 @xcite .",
    "several searches have been performed or are under way in 1s , 2s , and 3s cleo data .",
    "one can search for the allowed m1 transition in @xmath307 by reconstructing exclusive final states in @xmath308 decays and dispensing with the soft photon , which is likely to be swallowed up in background .",
    "final states are likely to be of high multiplicity .",
    "one can search for higher - energy but suppressed m1 photons in @xmath309 decays .",
    "these searches already exclude many models .",
    "the strongest upper limit obtained is for @xmath310 , @xmath311 : @xmath312 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "@xmath313 searches using sequential processes @xmath314 and @xmath315 ( the latter suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are being conducted but there are no results yet .",
    "additional searches for @xmath305 involve the transition @xmath316 [ for which a typical experimental upper bound based on earlier cleo data @xcite is @xmath317 ) ] , with a possible @xmath318 transition expected to have a 40% branching ratio @xcite .",
    "cleo and bes - iii will make new contributions to heavy quark spectroscopy .",
    "cleo will focus on center - of - mass energies 3770 and 4170 mev , to obtain about 750 pb@xmath136 at each energy .",
    "goals include the best possible determination of @xmath116 and @xmath118 , measurements of form factors for semileptonic @xmath54 and @xmath319 decays which will provide incisive tests for lattice gauge theories , and measurement of the ckm factors @xmath320 and @xmath321 with unprecedented precision .",
    "cleo collected over 26 million @xmath222 ( about 8 times the current sample ) this past summer and looks forward to fruitful analyses of these data . cleo - c running will end at the end of march 2008 ; bes - iii will take over , and panda ( a proposed detector in germany ) is anticipated to begin running in 2014 .",
    "belle has taken 2.9 fb@xmath136 of data at @xmath322 .",
    "they have been concerned primarily with `` invisible '' decays of the @xmath323 [ also the subject of a cleo search ] , tagged via @xmath324 .",
    "this sample is also potentially valuable for spectroscopy .",
    "cleo has ( 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.2 ) fb@xmath136 at 1s , 2s , 3s .",
    "both babar and belle have shown interest in hadron spectroscopy ; they are well - positioned to study it",
    ". there have been useful contributions from cdf and d0 as well .",
    "hadron spectroscopy is providing both long - awaited states like @xmath170 ( whose mass and production rate confirm theories of quark confinement and isospin - violating @xmath325-emission transitions ) and surprises like low - lying p - wave @xmath319 mesons , x(3872 ) , x(3940 ) , y(3940 ) , z(3940 ) and y(4260 ) .",
    "decays of the @xmath196 have been important in confirming its interpretation as a d - wave @xmath7 state with some s - wave admixture .",
    "we are continuing to learn about properties of qcd in the strong - coupling regime through evidence for molecules , 3s , 2p , 4s or hybrid charmonium , and interesting decays of states above flavor threshold .",
    "qcd may not be the last strongly coupled theory with which we have to deal .",
    "understanding the mystery of electroweak symmetry breaking or the very structure of quarks and leptons may require related techniques .",
    "these insights are coming to us in general from experiments at the frontier of intensity and detector capabilities rather than energy , and illustrate the importance of a diverse approach to the fundamental structure of matter .",
