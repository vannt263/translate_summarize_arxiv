    "proto - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) are objects in transition between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula ( pn ) stages of stellar evolution .",
    "studies over the past decade , particularly imaging studies with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) , have shown that this transition stage is key to understanding the shaping of pns @xcite . in the interacting stellar winds model",
    "@xcite , which was later generalized to include an equatorial density gradient @xcite , it was assumed that a fast wind from the central star interacted with the detached , slowly - moving remnant agb envelope to shape the nebula .",
    "_ hst _ images of ppns show that many and perhaps most of them display a basic bipolar structure @xcite .",
    "these are shapes that appear to be further developed in the pn stage .",
    "in addition , a point symmetry is often seen ; @xcite attribute this to collimated jets , which may be episodic and change their direction , and which they advocate as the main shaping agents of pns .",
    "studying @xmath1 in ppns is one of the best ways to probe the presence of a fast , perhaps collimated , post - agb wind and its effect in shaping the nebula . @xmath1is the main constituent of the detached circumstellar envelope around a ppn .",
    "while a fast wind ( v@xmath4100 km s@xmath5 ) has the energy to dissociate the @xmath1on direct impact , it can also produce shocks in the medium that move at a slower speed and collisionally excite the @xmath1 .",
    "recent surveys have shown the presence of shock - excited @xmath1 in bipolar ppns @xcite .",
    "detailed high - resolution @xmath1studies have been published of approximately a half dozen ppns @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a detailed @xmath1emission study of three bipolar ppns , iras 16594@xmath04656 ( `` water lily nebula '' ) , hen 3@xmath0401 ( iras 10178@xmath05958 ) , and rob 22 ( iras 10197@xmath05750 ) .",
    "all three have relatively hot central stars for ppns , b and a spectral types , and all possess large infrared excesses due to circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "all three are or would be classified as duplex ( `` dust prominent , longitudinally - extended '' ) nebulae in the classification system of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "rob 22 has a nebula that looks like a pair of butterfly wings . at high spatial resolution",
    ", the lobes show a filamentary structure in visible light .",
    "in addition to bipolar structure , some point symmetry is apparent in the lobes .",
    "a large halo extends out to 25@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the nebula appears to be viewed essentially edge on , with a dark lane obscuring the star in visible light . in the more detailed morphological classification system of @xcite , this object is classified as bcw , ml , ps(s),h(e ) : bipolar nebula with closed lobes , central obscuring waist , minor lobes present , point - symmetric shape , and enlongated halo .",
    "the spectral type is a2  ie , based on light reflected off the lobes of the nebula @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar envelope appears to have a dual chemistry , with an oxygen - rich region evidenced by oh maser emission ( oh284.18 - 0.79 ; * ? ? ? * ) and crystalline silicate emission @xcite and a carbon - rich region evidenced by pah emission @xcite .",
    "the nebula of hen 3 - 401 possesses long , narrow lobes .",
    "it seems to be viewed at a slightly larger angle with respect to the plane of the sky , with the central star appearing faintly between the lobes @xcite .",
    "the morphological classification of this object is bow*(0.6),sk : bipolar nebula with open lobes , central obscuring waist with star evident ( at 0.6 @xmath7 m ) , with a skirt - like structure @xcite .",
    "the spectral type of the star is be , and the spectrum shows strong balmer emission lines and lots of permitted and forbidden low - excitation emission lines @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar envelope appears to be carbon - rich , since it shows co emission @xcite and pah emission @xcite but not oh @xcite emission or crystalline silicates @xcite .    in iras 16594@xmath04656 ,",
    "the star is clearly seen and relatively bright compared to the nebula , giving the impression that the nebula is at a larger orientation angle .",
    "the nebula has the appearance of a basic bipolar structure with a pronounced point symmetry , consisting of three pairs of oppositely - directed , slightly curved , thin lobes .",
    "also seen is a smaller elliptical structure oriented from northwest to southeast @xcite .",
    "the morphological classification of this object is mcw*(0.6),an , ps(m , an),h(a ) : multipolar nebula with closed lobes , central obscuring waist with star evident ( at 0.6 @xmath7 m ) , ansae present , point symmetry with two or more pairs of diametrically opposed lobes and with ansae , and a halo with centrosymmetric arcs @xcite .",
    "its spectrum shows balmer emission lines @xcite and has been classified as b7 based on the h@xmath8 line @xcite .",
    "@xcite , on the basis of high - resolution spectra , fit the spectrum with t@xmath9=14,000 k and log_g_=2.1 , slightly hotter than @xmath10 ori ( b8  i ) ; this indicates a spectral type of b5 - 7 ie .",
    "he also observed many emission lines .",
    "the nebula appears to be carbon rich , showing pah features and displaying the 21 @xmath7 m and 30 @xmath7 m features seen in carbon - rich evolved stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently published a detailed kinematic and morphologic study of this object using h@xmath11 emission , and we will refer to their results in the present study .",
    "we begin with an examination of the high - resolution @xmath1images ( see @xcite for preliminary images of rob 22 and hen 3@xmath0401 and @xcite for preliminary images of iras 16594@xmath04656 ) , then present new high - resolution , long - slit @xmath1spectra , and then follow with a discussion of the kinematics . from these ,",
    "we are able to determine properties of the collimated winds in these three ppns and how they have shaped the surrounding nebulae .",
    "high - resolution near - infrared imaging observations of the three ppns were obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera 2 ( nic2 ) .",
    "the camera has a resolution of @xmath12 and a field of view of 195 @xmath13 193 .",
    "observations were made with a narrow - band @xmath14 filter ( f212n ) and also with an adjacent continuum filter ( f215n ) for the purpose of distinguishing the @xmath11@xmath00 s(1 ) emission from the scattered starlight .",
    "hen 3 - 401 and rob 22 were observed on 1998 under general observer program i d no .",
    "7840 ( pi : kwok ) using the original _ hst _ nicmos camera .",
    "observations were also made with the f160w ( h ) and f222 m ( k ) filters for both of these objects .",
    "iras 16594@xmath04656 was observed in 2002 under general observer program i d no .",
    "9366 ( pi : hrivnak ) using the refurbished _ hst _",
    "nicmos camera .",
    "observations were also made with the f110w ( j ) filter .",
    "the observing log is listed in table [ obslog ] .",
    "the data were taken in the multiple non - destructive mode ( multiaccum ) to obtain a high dynamic range without saturating the detector .",
    "three sets of observations were made through each filter at each position on the array , and each target was imaged at three ( hen 3 - 401 , rob 22 ) or four ( iras 16594 - 4656 ) different positions of the nic2 array using a predefined dither pattern .",
    "the data were processed using the standard nicmos _ calnica _ pipeline , which applied bias subtraction , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , and cosmic ray removal . the more recent data for iras 16594@xmath04656 were re - calibrated using the hst archival on - the - fly reprocessing system , which provides recalibration using the most up - to - date reference files .",
    "the individual files were then corrected for the `` pedestal effect '' using iraf / stsdas _ pedsub _ task to flattening the sky value in the four quadrants of the nic2 array .",
    "we then combined the twelve images with each filter using the iraf stsdas / dither package with the parameters suggested in the _ hst dither handbook _ @xcite .",
    "the data for hen3@xmath0401 and rob 22 , which were taken and reduced earlier , were reduced with the same philosophy but in a more manual fashion , as described by @xcite .",
    "the reduced f212n and f215n images were then flux calibrated using the appropriate calibration values for each filter before and after the nicmos refurbishing .",
    "these calibration values are listed in table [ obscal ] .",
    "the individual f212n and f215n images for the three ppns , with the thermal backgrounds removed , are displayed in figure [ h2_raw ] .    for iras 16594@xmath04656 ,",
    "the relatively - bright central star is surrounded by a distinct peanut - shaped nebula in the f212n image , while only some smaller and fainter nebulosity surrounds the star in the f215n image . thus one can immediately see that most of the nebular light in the f212n image is due to the @xmath1emission rather than scattered starlight .",
    "one can also see faint emission from two of the pairs of longer , thin lobes , with brighter emission ( `` ansae '' ) at their ends . for rob  22 ,",
    "the f212n and f215n images appear rather similar .",
    "they each show , rather than a central star , emission coming from two closely - spaced regions separated by a dark equatorial band .",
    "these bright regions may represent light from the central star scattered toward us from above and below an obscuring disk or torus .",
    "the two bright regions lie roughly along the line that connects the approximately point - symmetric outer ends of the two lobes",
    ". the dark space between the two bright regions might thus be due to the torus .",
    "the nebula appears to be a little brighter in the f212n image than in the f215n image , especially in the outer regions , indicating that in the f212n image the nebula is seen mostly in scattered light but with some contribution from @xmath1emission . for hen 3@xmath0401",
    ", the nebula is seen more clearly and is larger in the f212n image than in the f215 image , indicating that in the f212n image , it is seen in both scattered light and @xmath1emission .",
    "the star is bright in each image .",
    "to produce images of these three ppns showing only @xmath1emission requires the removal of the scattered light from the f212n image , which can be accomplished through the subtraction of an appropriately scaled image of the adjacent continuum ( f215n image ) .",
    "the scaling is necessary to correct for differences in the source continuum in the two bandpasses .",
    "differences due to the filter profiles and detector response were corrected by the flux calibration . in a similar previous study @xcite , we examined the question of how best to scale the f215n continuum image for subtraction from the f212n image to remove the scattered continuum light .",
    "the object of that study , iras 17150@xmath03224 , had no other emission lines in these two bandpasses , and thus a simple correction for the continuum levels was appropriate . in these cases , we also need to be concerned about other emission features which may be contributing to the flux in the two filters .    in the following sub - sections we discuss the details of the continuum removal and the resulting @xmath1image for each object .",
    "a spectrum for iras 16594@xmath04656 in the 2 @xmath7 m region ( 2.10@xmath02.27 @xmath7 m ) has been published by @xcite .",
    "it was obtained with a long slit 1@xmath150 wide and oriented e - w .",
    "the spectrum shows a relatively strong @xmath1feature at 2.12 @xmath7 m with a much weaker br@xmath16 emission line .",
    "since the br@xmath16 is at a wavelength that places it at the edge of a wing of the f215n filter profile , its contribution is insignificant in this image .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ filters ] , which shows the spectrum of the object plotted together with the filter profiles .",
    "thus , for the continuum removal , we convolved a linear fit to the observed spectral continuum ( with the @xmath1emission removed ) with the filter profiles and the detector response using the stsdas / synphot _ calcphot _ task .",
    "this resulted in a scale factor of 1.016 that we used to scale the f215n image prior to subtraction of the flux - calibrated images .",
    "the resultant @xmath1image of iras 16594@xmath04656 is displayed in figure [ h2_images]a .",
    "it shows a limb - brightened , double - lobed bipolar structure with the west lobe larger and brighter ( ratio of 1.6 ) than the east lobe .",
    "approximate sizes ( 10@xmath17 level ) are 2@xmath156 by 2@xmath158 for the west lobe and 2@xmath152 by 2@xmath155 for the east lobe . in addition , one can see two pairs of more distant @xmath14-emitting ansae , each pair collinear on a line passing through the star .",
    "the ansae to the sw are brighter and farther from the star than those to the ne , with distances of 6@xmath152 and 5@xmath154 for the ansae at pa=33@xmath2 and of 5@xmath158 and 4@xmath157 for the those at pa=54@xmath2 .",
    "these ansae are found at the ends of the thin lobes seen in the visible light images @xcite , and will be discussed together with the visible image in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the emission at the position of the star appears to approximately cancel out , indicating that there is little , if any , @xmath1emission from the star .",
    "spectra of the 2.12 @xmath7 m @xmath1line and the br@xmath16 line of hen 3 - 401 have been published by @xcite .",
    "they observed this object twice with a 4@xmath155-wide slit oriented at p.a .",
    "= 70@xmath2 and 90@xmath2 , approximately along the bipolar axis , and they found the @xmath1emission to be clearly extended .",
    "the @xmath1line is stronger than the br@xmath16 line by about a factor of 1.5 , and since the latter lies in the wing of the f215n filter , its contribution to the flux in the f215n image is very small .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ filters ] . neglecting the contribution of the line results in a scale factor of 0.994 ( the spectrum is essentially flat in this region ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath1image of hen 3 - 401 is shown in figure [ h2_images]b .",

    "rob 22 was also observed spectroscopically in this region by @xcite .",
    "they observed with the slit oriented at p.a .",
    "= 90@xmath2 , in this case almost perpendicular to the bipolar lobes . with a slit width of 4@xmath155 ,",
    "they likely included most of the nebula but missed some of the @xmath1emission from the very ends of the lobes .",
    "their spectra show the br@xmath16 line to be stronger than the h@xmath11 2.12 @xmath7 m @xmath1line by about a factor of 2.5 , but since it still falls on the extreme edge of the filter profile , its contribution will be small .",
    "nevertheless , we examined the scaling of the f215n image with and without consideration of this emission line . neglecting the contribution of the line results in a scale factor of 0.979 , while including it results in a scale factor of 0.967 .",
    "we will use the scale factor with the line included , but note that the difference is only at the 1% level .",
    "note , however , that the difference can be larger in localized regions , since the br@xmath16 and h@xmath11 emissions likely have different distributions .",
    "the resulting @xmath1image of rob 22 is shown in figure [ h2_images]c . the nebula appears to have somewhat of a point - symmetric `` s '' shape , with a bright clump in the inner part of each lobe near the position of the unseen central star ( clump to the ne is brighter ) and a ridge of @xmath1along the the end of each lobe ( especially the s lobe ) .",
    "the north lobe is brighter , with a ratio of 1.2 .",
    "much of the extended structure within a few arcsec of the star disappears after continuum subtraction , indicating that the features at the bases of the polar lobes nearest the star are due to scattered light from a dusty flared disk or torus , not h@xmath11 emission .",
    "high dispersion , long - slit spectral observations were made of the three sources in the @xmath1@xmath18=1@xmath00 s(1 ) line at 2.1218 @xmath7 m using the near - infrared echelle spectrograph phoenix @xcite on the 8-m gemini - south telescope on cerro pachon , chile .",

    "the area of the sky projected by the long slit onto the detector is @xmath313@xmath154 in length , so for the observations of iras  16594@xmath04656 and hen  3 - 401 , more than one exposure was taken moving along the slit , yielding a longer effective slit to cover each target .",
    "the observations were made in 2003 under three queue observing programs ( gs-2002b - q-53 , gs-2003a - q-27 , gs-2003b - q-41 ) .",
    "image quality on the different nights varied from 0@xmath157 to 1@xmath150 as measured in the r band .",

    "two of the slit positions were oriented to pass though the star and the pairs of @xmath1clumps .",
    "an observing log listing the slit positions is given in table [ ph_obs ] , and the orientations of the slit for these various observations are shown in figure [ ph_obs ] .",
    "the weather for these observations was mostly clear , although some patchy clouds were present during observations of rob 22 and iras 16594@xmath04656 .",
    "sky subtraction was accomplished by obtaining one exposure of blank sky near each source immediately before or after a pair of exposures of the target .",
    "spectral flat fields were obtained using an internal quartz emission lamp . for each target , a bright standard star was observed on the same night with the same grating setting in order to correct for telluric absorption and for flux calibration .",
    "numerous telluric lines were also used for wavelength calibration , adopting the telluric spectrum available from noao .",
    "we calculated the apparent velocities adopting a rest wavelength of 21218.356   for the h@xmath11 @xmath18=10 s(1 ) line ( bragg , brault , & smith 1982 ) , and these velocities were then corrected to a heliocentric reference frame .",
    "uncertainty in the resulting velocities is roughly @xmath201 km s@xmath5 , dominated by scatter in the dispersion solution for the numerous telluric lines across the observed wavelength range .",
    "spectra of iras 16594@xmath04656 were obtained at five different positions on the nebula , as illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the resulting position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams are shown in figure [ spec_16594 ] . in all cases",
    "the brightest emission displays a closed ellipse , but with different sizes and strong variations in intensity around the ellipse .",
    "in slit position _ a _ ( pa=72@xmath2 ) , which is along the major bipolar axis , and slit position _ b _ ( pa=52@xmath2 ) , which is rotated 20@xmath2 from the major axis , the inner ellipses seem to be tilted slightly , with the w - sw lobe slightly blue - shifted compared to the e - ne lobe . however , this is a small effect , and the polar axis appears to lie very close to the plane of the sky .",
    "slit positions _",
    "c _ ( pa=33@xmath2 ) and _ d _ ( pa=345@xmath2 ) also pass through the star , but are oriented closer to the minor axis ( slit position d is along the minor axis ) , and the size of the bright inner ellipse is correspondingly smaller .",
    "slit position _ e _ ( pa=345@xmath2 ) is parallel to the minor axis but offset from the star through the larger w lobe .",
    "the pv diagram at this position is consistent with a slice through a shell expanding with a velocity of @xmath38 - 9 km s@xmath5 and with the n side brighter .",

    "however , in both cases the brighter sw clumps appear farther from the star than the ne clumps , so the assumption of constant velocity for the clumps may not be correct .",
    "alternatively , the clumps may simply be non - uniform brightness enhancements at the ends of the filaments .",
    "the bright ellipses are consistent with limb - brightened lobes .",
    "when allowance is made for the resolution of the spectra , it appears that the interiors of the lobes are devoid of @xmath1emission . in the four slit positions that include the star ( fig . [ spec_16594 ] , panels @xmath21 )",
    ", the blue - shifted side of the inner ellipse is brighter .",
    "this may be due to extinction within the lobes or intrinsically brighter @xmath1emission from the side facing us .",
    "the elliptical morphologies of the pv diagrams for the four slit positions through the star , especially the one along the major axis , are consistent with an expanding ellipsoid .",
    "thus they differ from the `` peanut - shape '' pv diagram that one might expect from two bipolar expanding bubbles .",
    "thus the expansion along the minor axis does not appear to be significantly retarded by a constraining higher - density torus .",
    "we investigated the velocity field in more detail using the morpho - kinematic modeling program _ shape _ @xcite . in this program ,",
    "the morphology of the nebula and the velocity field can be specified and a resulting pv diagram produced .",
    "the shape of the nebula was assumed to be a three - dimensional symmetrical dumbbell based on the h@xmath11 ( cross - sectional ) image .",
    "it was then assumed that the h@xmath11 emissivity uniformly followed the contours of the nebula .",
    "we began by investigating a velocity field in which the velocity increased linearly with distance ( so - called `` hubble flow '' ) , which is seen in some pns and is seen in hen 3@xmath0401 ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "this produced a pv diagram that had a peanut shape , contrary to the elliptical shape seen ( see figure [ shape_16594 ] .",
    "left and right panels ) .",
    "when we assumed on the other hand a constant velocity ( 9 km  s@xmath5 ) , the pv diagram agreed more closely with the observed ellipse but was slightly diamond - shaped .",
    "a very good fit was obtained by the addition of a slight hubble flow , with _ v _",
    "= ( 8 + 2.4_r_/1@xmath6 ) km  s@xmath5 , as shown in the middle panels of figure [ shape_16594 ] .",
    "we determine , based on adding an inclination to the model , that the tilt of the polar axis is no more than @xmath310@xmath2 from the plane of the sky .",
    "slices in velocity across the p - v diagrams at position along the slit = 0  ( along the line of sight through the star ) with width 0@xmath1577 are displayed in figure [ slice_16594 ] .",
    "these show a uniform expansion of the shell with an expansion velocity of v@xmath22 = 9 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the velocity center is at @xmath030 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the expansion velocity of the lobe at 0@xmath159 west of the star is similar ; this is consistent with uniform expansion of an elliptical bubble .",
    "these observations reveal a systemic heliocentric radial velocity of v@xmath23(@xmath14 ) = @xmath030 km s@xmath5 , which translates to v@xmath24 = @xmath026 km s@xmath5 , with v@xmath22 = 9 km s@xmath5 .",
    "these velocities can be compared with the millimeter - wave co @xmath25=1@xmath00 emission line of v@xmath26(co ) = @xmath026 km s@xmath5 with v@xmath22 = 16 km s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the co expansion represents the velocity of the outer remnant of the agb mass loss expanding into the ambient ism , while the @xmath1expansion represents the velocity of the shock front at the edge of the inner bipolar cavity along the line - of - site direction , which is essentially perpendicular to the polar axis .",
    "the difference between these two expansion velocities appears to reflect the two different kinematic regions .",
    "heliocentric radial velocity measurements of individual lines in the visible spectrum showed a range of @xmath010 to @xmath040 km s@xmath5 , with average values of @xmath3@xmath020 km s@xmath5 for the absorption lines and @xmath3@xmath032 km s@xmath5 for the emission lines @xcite .",

    ", some emission appears to partially fill the interior of the lobes ; this may simply be contamination from the very edges of the lobes due to seeing .",
    "the bipolar axis is obviously tilted from the plane of the sky , with the w lobe moving toward us , and with velocities along the lobes that are proportional to distance from the star ( hubble flow ) .",
    "the pairs of convex arcs represent emission from the thin front and back walls of slightly barrel - shaped lobes .",
    "the difference between the pair in each lobe is about 30 km s@xmath5 for the slit passing through the star ( fig .",
