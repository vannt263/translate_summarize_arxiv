    "in the last few years , stochastic geometry has been widely used for system - level modeling , performance evaluation , and optimization of several candidate system architectures , network topologies , and transmission technologies for next - generation cellular networks @xcite . at present , many tractable mathematical methodologies for analyzing and optimizing ( heterogeneous ) cellular networks in terms of average rate @xcite , coverage @xcite and error probability @xcite , @xcite exist .",
    "the tractability of currently available methodologies originates from two main assumptions : 1 ) the network elements are modeled as points of a poisson point process ( ppp ) and 2 ) the path - loss , as a function of the distance , is modeled as a power - decaying function with distance - independent parameters @xcite .",
    "recent studies based on actual cellular network deployments and building footprints have unveiled that the ppp - based assumption is sufficiently accurate for modeling dense urban environments , _",
    "e.g. _ , downtown london @xcite .",
    "they have disclosed , on the other hand , the crucial impact of the path - loss model for system - level analysis and optimization . in particular , coverage and rate estimated by relying on the conventional power - decaying path - loss model are qualitatively and quantitatively different compared with those obtained by using more realistic path - loss models , which , _",
    "e.g. _ , originate from channel measurements and/or are recommended by standardization working groups for evaluating and comparing different wireless access technologies @xcite .",
    "they have revealed , in addition , the need of taking the radiation pattern of transmit and receive antennas into account , in order to adequately quantify the impact of the other - cell interference and , hence , of network densification , _",
    "i.e. _ , small cell technology .    motivated by these considerations ,",
    "a few researchers have recently generalized the ppp - based approach for modeling cellular networks @xcite , by assuming more realistic path - loss models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these papers have unveiled , _",
    "e.g. _ , that the impact of network densification depends on the path - loss model being adopted . in @xcite , the authors employ a two - slope path - loss model and show that an optimal density of base stations ( bss ) exists .",
    "this finding is in contradiction with @xcite , which , by assuming a power - decaying path - loss model , proved the density - invariance of interference - limited cellular networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the author uses a three - state path - loss model that is empirically derived from channel measurements conducted in new york city for transmission in the millimeter wave band .",
    "the path - loss model accounts for line - of - sight ( los ) , non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) , and outage links , whose probability of occurrence is distance - dependent .",
    "it is proved that coverage and rate depend on the density of bss . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors employ a path - loss model that accounts for los and nlos links , whose probability of occurrence is an exponential and a linear function of the distance , respectively .",
    "similar to @xcite , it is shown that the density - invariance property does not hold anymore .",
    "the authors of @xcite unveil , however , that the impact of network densification depends on the load model being considered : if the densities of mobile terminals ( mts ) and bss do not scale at the same rate ( _ i.e. _ , full traffic load ) , small cell deployments provide better performance compared with the predictions in @xcite and @xcite .    the discoveries in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite bring to light the need of more realistic modeling assumptions in stochastic geometry analysis of cellular networks .",
    "they , however , still rely on important simplifications , as well as introduce mathematical methodologies that , although computationally affordable in many cases , lack tractability for general cellular setups . in @xcite ,",
    "no los and nlos links are considered . in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "simplified link - state models are assumed . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "no directional antennas and shadowing for cell association are taken into account , rayleigh fading for all links is considered , saturated traffic load ( except @xcite ) is assumed . in spite of that , the frameworks are still formulated in terms of multi - fold integrals , which do not provide direct insight on the impact of key system parameters , _",
