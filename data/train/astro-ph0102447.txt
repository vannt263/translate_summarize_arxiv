    "over fifty years after the discovery of the expansion of the universe , the value of the expansion rate , h@xmath11 is yet to be determined to high accuracy .",
    "although there is a general consensus amongst astronomers that it lies somewhere between 40 and 100 kms@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and probably between 50 and 70 kms@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , no conclusive result has yet been obtained .",
    "the hubble constant is a fundamental cosmological parameter , and its value is important for the determination of the age , density and ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "h@xmath11 is usually measured by calculating the gradient of redshift against distance for a sample of galaxies .",
    "however , the hubble redshift of galaxies can only be accurately determined at higher redshifts where the contribution of peculiar motions are proportionately smaller and here the measurement of extragalactic distances becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "the primary extragalactic distance indicators are the cepheid variables .",
    "although there are several standard candle techniques used to measure extragalactic distances , most are calibrated using the cepheid distances to nearby galaxies .",
    "accurate cepheid distances , which are free from systematic errors are therefore vitally important to determinations of h@xmath11 .",
    "the hubble space telescope has allowed new measurements of cepheid distances to many galaxies outside the local group and several groups have attempted to measure h@xmath11 using these distances . the aim of the largest group , ( the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ) is to calculate h@xmath11 with an accuracy of 10% .",
    "if this is to be achieved , then several possible sources of systematic error need to be looked at in detail .",
    "these include the cepheid p - l calibration in the lmc .",
    "a recent recalibration @xcite could cause h@xmath11 to decrease by @xmath3 10% @xcite .",
    "in this paper we first check the effects of metallicity on the dispersion of the cepheid p - l relation , using data from the h@xmath11 key project .",
    "then we systematically apply cuts to the data in period , in order to investigate the effects on the dispersion / metallicity relationship .",
    "we also discuss the possible causes of what is observed .",
    "we then investigate the consequences of both a global metallicity correction and the effects of bias due to incompleteness at faint magnitudes .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood technique to fit p - l relations truncated due to magnitude incompleteness and hence derive new cepheid distances .",
    "the data analysed in this work is from sources that have been either published or accepted for publication . in total , results for 25 galaxies were examined . of these ,",
    "18 were from the ` hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ' team .",
    "the photometry and cepheid periods are used as published .",
    "most of this data was taken from the key project archive website ( http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/h0kp ) .",
    "this gives the photometry / period data for the cepheids in each of the galaxies .",
    "this was used along with published papers to obtain exactly the same data as was used by the key project team in their distance determinations .",
    "the references are as follows : ngc 925 @xcite ; ngc 1326a @xcite ; ngc 1365 @xcite ; ngc 1425 @xcite ; ngc2090 @xcite ; ngc 2541 @xcite ; ngc 3031 @xcite ; ngc 3198 @xcite ; ngc 3319 @xcite ; ngc 3351 @xcite ; ngc 3621 @xcite ; ngc 4321 @xcite ; ngc 4414 @xcite ; ngc 4535 @xcite ; ngc 4548 @xcite ; ngc 4725 @xcite ; ngc 5457 @xcite ; ngc 7331 @xcite .",
    "details about how the data was obtained and reduced can be found in these papers and the references therein .",
    "the other 7 galaxies were from two sources : , for ngc 3368 and the supernova calibration team of for the galaxies ngc 3627 , ngc 4639 , ngc 4496a , ngc 4536 , ngc 5253 and ic 4182 .",
    "once the data became available on the hst archive , the images for these galaxies were reanalysed by the key project team in , using the same software and reduction procedure as for the other 18 galaxies . for consistency ,",
    "the cepheids in the hst images selected by , along with their photometry and period determination are used here , rather than the originally published data .",
    "cepheid data was taken from the key project website and the references given in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "an unweighted least squares fit was made to the magnitude versus period data for the cepheids in each galaxy in both the v - band and the i - band . in this case , the line is the cepheid p - l relation , which in the v - band is given by    @xmath12    a similar relationship is used in the i - band with a p - l slope of -3.06 now assumed .",
    "the slope is held constant to that of the lmc p - l relation @xcite .",
    "this is done to minimise the effects of magnitude limited bias , since this would tend to make the slope shallower .",
    "the key project team also follows this procedure in fitting their p - l relations .",
    "the mean r.m.s .",
    "dispersion about the p - l relation was also calculated , this is generally considered to be due to the small variation in magnitude across the instability strip and any statistical noise / experimental errors .",
    "plots of the p - l relations are given in figure [ fig : pl1 ] .",
    "the mean magnitude found from the key project photometry for each cepheid is plotted against the period as calculated by the key project team .",
    "this is done in both the v- band and the i - band for all 25 galaxies .",
    "the plots show the best fitting line ( solid black ) to the data , along with the 2@xmath13 dispersion lines ( dashed ) for the lmc , within which most of the data should lie .",
    "also shown are magnitude limits ( horizontal broken lines ) .",
    "these were calculated from the exposure times given in the relevant papers ( see section [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "the key project team do not calculate any magnitude limits , so we calculated consistent magnitude limits using the results of as a basis . here magnitude limits of 26 ( in the v - band ) , and 25 ( in the i - band ) , could be imposed .",
    "this , whilst somewhat arbitrary , is justified by , as the region where statistical noise starts to become significant .",
    "the magnitude limits are therefore not absolute limits of non - detection , and many of the p - l relations in figure [ fig : pl1 ] contain cepheids that lie below their respective magnitude limits .",
    "table [ tab : cephmag ] lists the magnitude limits that have been calculated .",
    "the limits should be seen as the region where noise starts to become more significant and where there may be incompleteness in the number of cepheids .",
    "the magnitude limits for the other galaxies were calculated by scaling the exposure times ( under the assumption that observing conditions are stable for the hubble space telescope ) relative to the exposure times given in , using signal - to - noise ratio considerations . however , at this stage the limits are not used in the calculation of the dispersion .    also shown on the p - l plots in figure [ fig : pl1 ] , are possible limits in period for the p - l relations .",
    "this is due to the fact that short period cepheids may not be detected in crowded stellar fields , since they are both dimmer and more difficult to identify as cepheids . using artificial star tests , ,",
    "suggest that at virgo and fornax distances , p - l relations may be up to 50% incomplete below 20 - 25 days .",
    "they then applied period cuts at 20 and 25 days to all their p - l relations , and found a small increase in distance modulus for a small number of galaxies .",
    "report a similar effect for some of the non - key project galaxies .",
    "the p - l relation best fits , and hence distance moduli , were then revised , ( by the key project team ) for these galaxies . following this ,",
    "those galaxies recommended for period cuts by and were re - examined by ourselves , and the same period cuts applied .",
    "cepheids with periods below 20 days ( log p = 1.3 ) are not included in the best fit for the galaxies ngc 1326a , ngc 1425 , ngc 4725 , ngc 4536 and ngc 3368 .",
    "cuts at 25 days were done for ngc 1365 , ngc 4535 , ngc 4496a and ngc 3627 .",
    "the intercept and dispersion shown on the p - l relations for these galaxies are for period cut samples .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     /cos / h / pallen / plplots/ = 8.0truecm = 16.0truecm    in fact , we note that there is a correlation between @xmath14 and metallicity amongst these eight galaxies , in the sense that higher metallicity galaxies have higher @xmath14 .",
    "a least squares fit to this relation gives a slope of 0.284@xmath70.086 . since the peak - luminosity decline - rate correlation implies that higher @xmath14 means fainter snia luminosities it is clear that if this correlation is real the use of the peak - luminosity decline - rate correlation invokes a bigger metallicity effect in the snia luminosities than if it is ignored . when the metallicity correction of is applied without the @xmath14 correction , the slope of the peak luminosity - metallicity correlation reduces from -0.92@xmath70.33 to -0.75@xmath70.34 .",
    "now it might be argued that the fact that the @xmath14 correction works only to accentuate the effect of metallicity on type ia luminosity means that the empirically determined decline rate correlation is evidence against a strong metallicity effect for snia .",
    "however , the decline rate correction is much smaller than the proposed metallicity correction which would be dominant .",
    "also , the selection effects induced by the wide dispersion in snia luminosity would have to be carefully taken into account before coming to any conclusion .",
    "for example , snia surveys at intermediate redshifts would preferentially detect the brighter snia in higher metallicity galaxies , leading to snia which were systematically too bright relative to local snia and with an artificially too small dispersion .",
    "there would also be a potentially serious impact on the snia hubble diagram determinations of q@xmath8 ; if the average metallicity of galaxies was a factor of 3 lower at @xmath15 than observed locally then the snia would on average be @xmath30.3 mag fainter than expected and this is order of the amount needed to explain away the positive detection of the cosmological constant by the supernova cosmology teams @xcite .",
    "after a detailed analysis of the relationship between the dispersion in cepheid p - l relations and metallicity , it can be inferred that there is a relationship in the v - band at the level 0.10 @xmath7 0.03 mag dex@xmath2 , in the sense that the dispersion about the p - l relation increases with metallicity .",
    "this is a good fit and significant at the 3@xmath13 level and may arise because high metallicity galaxies contain cepheids with a wider range of metallicities and hence luminosities .",
    "the reason that a less strong relationship is observed in the i - band is unclear .",
    "it could be that metallicity effects are less significant in the i - band or that a relationship with the same slope but a lower amplitude is masked in i because of the effect of photometry / crowding errors on the intrinsically tighter dispersion .",
    "the size of the dispersion metallicity correlation that we find is roughly consistent with the global p - l metallicity dependence of @xmath1=-0.66 $ ] mag dex@xmath2 claimed by .",
    "the first consequence of this is that there is now more evidence that a global metallicity correction should be applied to cepheid distances .",
    "the second consequence is that the effects of incompleteness bias may also be important , especially for high metallicity galaxies at large distances .",
    "these results combined imply that cepheid distance moduli are too short on the average by 0.29@xmath70.21mag and by up to @xmath30.5mag in the case of the distant high metallicity galaxies .",
    "we have described the effects on the distance scale if the metallicity corrections to cepheid distances suggested here prove accurate .",
    "we have shown that the distances to the virgo galaxy cluster increase from 16.6 to 20.9 mpc .",
    "we have shown that there would be a significant scale error in the tf scale which would mean that the tf relation underestimates distances by 46% at the distance of virgo .",
    "we have suggested thatthis may be due to the high metallicity of the hst cepheid galaxies compared to the local calibrators and that metallicity may act as a significant second parameter in the tf relation .",
    "we have shown by correcting tf distances to the virgo , fornax and ursa major clusters that this leads to a range of values of @xmath9 between 43 - 64 kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 if no infall model is assumed and a value of h@xmath8=58@xmath77 km s@xmath2mpc@xmath2 if an infall model is assumed , although the infall model itself is highly uncertain .",
    "we have also shown that if the cepheid luminosities are metallicity dependent then so are the peak luminosities of type ia supernovae . new information on the metallicity of type ia supernovae at both intermediate and high redshifts will be needed before conclusions on supernova estimates of h@xmath8 and q@xmath8 can be drawn .",
    "of course , cepheids with or without metallicity corrections provide no direct check on the secondary distance indicators that are purely associated with early - type galaxies such as sbf , pnlf or fundamental plane indicators .",
    "therefore we simply note that the early - type route to h@xmath8 through the leo - i group @xcite , which is the most nearby galaxy group containg both spirals with hst cepheids and early - type galaxies is that our corrected distance to leo - i of 12.5@xmath70.3 mpc from the 11.2@xmath71.0mpc quoted by is that the derived value of h@xmath8 will therefore decrease from h@xmath8=67@xmath77kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 to h@xmath8=60@xmath76kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 . but this estimate depends on using secondary distance indicators to obtain the coma - leo relative distance and it would be surprising if the metallicity corrections etc .",
    "were only found to be important for the spiral distance indicators !",
    "we therefore believe that there is increasing evidence that cepheid distances require significant corrections for the effects of metallicity and incompleteness bias with important potential consequences for the distance scale , hubble s constant and cosmology .",
    "further tests of the metallicity dependence of the cepheid p - l relation include a study of the metallicity of the main - sequence stars in the open cluster ngc7790@xcite .",
    "we are also using our metallicity - corrected cepheid distances to make new checks of dynamical infall models into virgo and fornax ( shanks and warfield in prep . ) .",
    "ultimately , a full understanding of the metallicity effects on cepheids and so the value of hubble s constant may require parallaxes to galactic cepheids outside the solar neighbourhood from astrometry satellites such as gaia and a larger sample of cepheids in galaxies with a wide range of metallicities from instruments such as the hst advanced camera and the ngst fitted with a visible camera .",
