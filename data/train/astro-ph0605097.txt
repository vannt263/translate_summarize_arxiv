    "in addition to the surface parameters , the mass loss is also affected by the period , since the atmosphere extension is pulsation - driven .",
    "relation ( i ) is the only one to include the pulsation explicitly .",

    "first , an instability involving the dust driving was suggested by @xcite : dust formation leads to increased dust density , until dust - gas coupling empties the dust shell .",
    "this leads to mass - loss episodes at the correct time scales . however , this instability is not correlated between different directions , and does not lead to spherical structures . cooling due to existing dust",
    "strongly enhances the local dust formation rate , leading to near - chaotic mass loss @xcite .",
    "second , a nuclear - burning instability was suggested by @xcite .",
    "third , the period instability found for long - period miras , interpreted as due to a non - linear pulsation , could cause the rings ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( zijlstra & bedding 2002 ) , via period - induced mass - loss variations .",
    "the hypotheses need to explain the slight irregularity in the ring spacings , and the decrease in spacings for rings closer to the star ( i.e. ejected later ) .",
    "the model involving the non - linearity in the pulsations can explain both .",
    "however , the issue is still far from settled .",

    "extinction variations are mainly seen in carbon - rich stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "strong asymmetries are present in the morphologies of almost all post - agb envelopes .",
    "these structures must have their origin during the agb mass loss .",
    "but remarkably little evidence for the precursors of the post - agb morphologies has been found .",
    "in fact , the current consensus is that agb envelopes are spherically symmetric , and that asymmetries form during a run - away process at the very tip of the agb .",
    "the argument that such a fundamental change happens during a phase which is unobservable only by its brevity , is far from convincing .",
    "two observations provide evidence for spherical agb shells .",
    "one comes from the oh maser profiles of oh / ir stars , with strong peaks at the extreme velocities . for asymmetric envelopes ,",
    "the emission at intermediate velocities becomes stronger and multiple peaks may develop ( * ? ? ? * ( chapman 1988 ) ) .",
    "the second observation is that the outer structures around pne and post - agb stars are often round , especially so for the rings .",
    "the regular detached shells around , e.g. , tt cyg should also be mentioned .",
    "however , both can be questioned .",
    "maser emission can not be used to determine a density structure .",
    "instead it is an exponential function of the column density at constant velocity , in competition between all directions .",
    "oh profiles are far more dependent on the velocity structure than on the densities .",
    "an asymmetric envelope with a spherically symmetric velocity structure will give rise to symmetric profiles .",
    "the rings appear to provide stronger evidence",
    ". however , any mass - loss changes leading to such rings are likely to be accompanied by changes in the expansion velocity .",
    "the rings then become the swept - up interface between the more massive , faster wind and the slower , weaker wind : @xcite show that the swept - up shell will move at constant velocity , with the location at anyone time given by :    @xmath30,\\ ] ]    where    @xmath31    if the two winds are self similar , and specifically if they show spherically symmetric velocities and show the same ratio of mass - loss rates in all directions , @xmath32 will be direction independent .",
    "the swept - up interface will be spherical , even if the underlying mass loss is not .",
    "thus , in both cases there is strong evidence for spherically symmetric_velocity fields _ , but the mass loss itself can be asymmetric .",
    "there is in fact growing evidence for bipolar shells on the agb .",
    "the bipolar envelope of x her was mapped by @xcite .",
    "the reflection nebula around rz sgr @xcite is bipolar in our ntt image ( fig .",

    "linear polarization is present in integrated photometric data of some oh / ir stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( jones &  gehrz 1990 ) ) .",
    "finally , the core of irc+10216 shows several components , possibly in a bipolar configuration ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( osterbart et al . 2000 ) ) .",
    "( the last two points can also be expained by woitke - type blobs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( woitke 2006 ) ) , however . )",
    "whereas binarity is now thought to be very common among post - agb stars and pne , and the likely cause of the asymmetries of the envelopes , very little is known about binarity among agb stars .",
    "the extreme brightness and low temperature of the agb star make a binary comnpanion difficult to detect , except where the companion interacts with the extended atmosphere or the wind .",
    "direct evidence for binarity among agb stars will be needed to make evolutionary connections between agb and post - agb stars .",
    "a distinction can be made between four different types of interaction .    1 .   common envelope systems , where the companion triggers the mass loss .",
    "these system will rarely reach the agb , as the common envelope is likely to develop already on the rgb .",
    "orbital separations are of the order of 1au .",
    "perhaps 10 per cent of proto planetary nebulae may derive from such systems , although fewer would evolve into pne .",
    "2 .   wider systems , where the geometry of the mass loss is affected , but not the mass - loss rate itself . these systems may include symbiotic stars and the rv tau progenitors .",
    "orbital separations are a few to tens of au , and the systems exhibit circumbinary disks and accretion",
    ". these may account for @xmath33 per cent of the pn birth rate .",
    "the companion may ionize part of the stellar wind , as in oh 231.8 + 4.2 .",
    "systems with only minor effects on the mass loss geometry .",
    "typical separations are @xmath34au",
    ". the geometry may show the movement of the mass - losing star , as in the spiral nebula around afgl 3068 ( * ? ? ? * ( mauron & huggins 2006 , see also morris et al , these proceedings ) ) .",
    "mira itself has a white dwarf companion @xmath35au away .",
    "the study of the interaction between the agb wind and its local ism was pioneered by @xcite .",
    "previously , the interaction had only been considered for old , ionized pne .",
    "the interaction begins in fact with the onset of the agb wind , and leads to a swept - up shell surrounding the agb star .",
    "once the swept - up mass exceeds the mass lost in the wind , the shell slows down and eventually becomes near - stationary .",
    "the typical radius of this shell is 12 pc , depending on local conditions .",
    "an example of such a shell , called a wall , was found by @xcite .",
    "the wall may wipe out any memory of long - term mass - loss fluctuations .",
    "once the pn fast wind reaches the outer wall , the pn rebrightens ; this increases the pn life time .    if there is a significant proper motion of the star with respect to the ism , the wall becomes one - sided and at higher velocities , becomes a bow shock .",
    "this is modelled by @xcite , based on the iphas morphology of the pn sh2 - 188 .",
    "the spitzer image of r hya ( speck , these proceedings ) show another example of such a bow shock . )",
    "evolutionary calculations for a large range of parameters are presented by wareing ( these proceedings ) .",
    "the effect of metallicity on agb mass loss is only just beginning to be explored .",
    "@xcite first showed that for [ fe / h]@xmath36 , dust - driven winds fail and the mass loss becomes pulsation - driven instead .",
    "this significantly reduces the mass - loss rates . using their formalisms ,",
    "@xcite find that the final ( white dwarf ) mass becomes higher at very low metallicity , and may reach the chandresekhar limit .",
    "this does not happen in the models of @xcite where core - dredge - up limits the core mass to @xmath37 .",
    "mass - loss rates in the lmc are as high as those in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that these values are reached at higher luminosities than for galactic stars .",
    "( the metallicity of the lmc is comparable to the outer galactic disk . )",
    "evidence for reduced mass - loss rates at much lower metallicity comes mainly from the specific frequency of pne , which is significantly lower in metal - poor dwarf galaxies compared to more metal - rich systems .",

    "evidence is sparse , as expansion velocities outside of our galaxy have only been measured for some lmc",
