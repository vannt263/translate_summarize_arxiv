    "recent results from high statistical simulations@xcite identified errors associated with the quenched approximation : predicted hadron masses in the continuum limit , in particular those containing strange quarks , differ from corresponding experimental values as large as 10% . the effect of the quark determinant must remove these differences .    in this talk i review recent progress in unquenched qcd simulations .",
    "i will survey the quality of current unquenched simulations and to what extent dynamical quark effects can be seen , in the light of the precise results from the quenched simulation@xcite .",
    "i first discuss several problems in unquenched simulations such as the auto - correlation and the finite size effect , which slowed down a lot unquenched simulations in the past .",

    "are analyzed for ks and wilson quark actions in parallel , to compare the quality of data .",
    "unfortunately and unexpectedly i notice that they disagree in the continuum limit even for the quenched case , as we will see .",
    "in the main part the effect of dynamical quarks on hadron spectra is discussed in the case of the wilson quark action .",
    "after the chiral extrapolation in the sea quark mass , the effect becomes most visible , in particular on the hyper - fine splitting of mesons , which consequently removes a large part of the quenching error in strange meson spectra .    in the last part ,",
    "the string breaking , the topological susceptibility and the flavor - singlet meson mass are discussed in connection with the dynamical quark effect .",
    "this year mostly positive results are reported on all these quantities .    some important subjects such as quark masses , weak - matrix elements and heavy quark physics in unquenched qcd will not be covered .",

    "moreover patterns of the size effect are different : size effects of ps and n are comparable and larger than that of v for the ks quark action while the size effect of n dominates for the wilson - type quark action .",
    "this difference is a part of scaling violation since finite size effect is universal in the continuum limit , and it may be caused by the chiral properties of the two actions : the ks quark retains chiral symmetry while the wilson - type quark breaks it explicitly .",
    "another possibility is that the `` effective '' lattice size for the ks quark may be smaller than the lattice size for the wilson quark , due to the spread of the ks quark over a hyper - cube in the spinor - flavor interpretation .",
    "obvious disadvantages of wilson - type quarks such as the absence of chiral symmetry , @xmath2 scaling violation and larger costs of numerical simulations are partly compensated by this milder finite size effect .",

    "one must , however , be careful to conclude this , since the physical lattice size in the simulations are different , @xmath152 fm in unquenched simulations and 3 fm in quenched ones , so that finite size effects could make such a difference .",
    "it is therefore interesting to obtain the corresponding plot in quenched qcd with the lattice size of 2.5 fm in the continuum limit , to identify the dynamical quark effect on the slope .",
    "moreover , even though some finite size effect is expected to exist on baryon spectra , the small scaling violation enables us to predict the chiral behavior of the baryon masses in the continuum limit with a fixed lattice size of 2.5 fm .",
    "similar results are obtained for the @xmath142-like octet baryon mass and the decuplet baryon mass . in particular",
    "almost no scaling violation is observed for the decuplet baryon mass at @xmath153 fm .",
    "in the past unquenched simulations , the expected behavior for string breaking that the static quark potential @xmath154 levels off at large enough @xmath155 , has not been observed@xcite : @xmath154 increases linearly in @xmath155 beyond the point where it exceeds the energy of the two mesons , due to poor overlap of wilson loops with the meson - meson state .",
    "several variational methods have been introduced to find better operators which have larger overlap with the meson - meson state , and successfully applied to several models such as an adjoint wilson loop in pure gauge theories or gauge - higgs models , showing the expected behavior for `` string breaking''@xcite .    at lattice99",
    "the milc collaboration has reported a first evidence of string breaking in unquenched qcd simulations@xcite , and the follow - up of the result is presented at this conference@xcite .",
    "they employ the @xmath156 ks fermion for dynamical quarks on a @xmath157 lattice at @xmath158 fm and @xmath159 .",
    "the energy obtained from meson - meson as well as meson - string correlators starts to level off at @xmath160 fm , where the energy is roughly equal to twice the mass of the heavy - light meson@xcite .",
    "the lowest three eigen - values , obtained by the diagonalization of correlators including the string - string one , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sb00]@xcite , which supports the result in ref.@xcite .",
    "the mixing between the string state and the meson - meson state , however , is found to be too weak to show level crossing@xcite .",
    "let me give one comment on the definition of string breaking .",
    "string breaking should be a phenomenon that the energy for one @xmath155-independent operator linearly increases at short distance and levels off at long distance . according to this criterion the behavior in ref .",
    "@xcite is really string breaking .",
    "if one uses different operators at different @xmath155 instead , the lowest energy can always be obtained by a diagonalization , even in the absence of the transition from the string state to the meson - meson state .",
    "apart from the string breaking , decays of hadrons , such as @xmath161 , give some indications of the dynamical quark effect , since such decays are possible but largely suppressed in the quenched approximation . at this conference ,",
    "the milc collaboration presents a result which indicates the decay of @xmath162@xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of string breaking , the @xmath163 operator employed in the simulation seems to well overlap with both @xmath164 and @xmath165 states .      from the flavor - singlet axial ward - takahashi(wt )",
    "identity in the continuum , @xmath166 one obtains @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the topological charge with the topological charge density @xmath169 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    therefore @xmath170 as @xmath171 .",
    "the topological susceptibility @xmath172 must vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "an investigation of this property on the lattice becomes a good check for lattice chiral symmetry in unquenched simulations .",
    "the decrease of @xmath172 toward @xmath173 is driven purely by the fermion determinant .    in the past simulations ,",
    "the expected decrease of @xmath172 has not been observed for both ks@xcite and wilson - type@xcite quark actions .",
    "the topological susceptibility normalized by @xmath14 does not show the quark mass dependence at all and values are consistent with the quenched one@xcite .",
    "this year the ukqcd collaboration@xcite and cp - pacs collaboration@xcite have obtained new results , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi00 ] .",
    "the decrease of @xmath172 toward the chiral limit is observed at @xmath58 fm for both pc(np ) and rc(tp ) actions , in contrast to the previous result at @xmath174 fm for the rc(tp ) action , though it is still far from verifying the flavor - singlet axial wt identity .",
    "theoretical considerations@xcite as well as further numerical analyses are needed to settle this issue completely .",
    "the fact that the flavor - singlet pseudo - scalar meson is not a nambu - goldstone boson(u(1 ) problem ) must be demonstrated by lattice qcd simulations .",
    "numerically this has been a difficult task since one has to calculate the quark 2-loop diagram special for the flavor - singlet meson . by the volume - sources method without gauge - fixing@xcite or the u(1 ) random noise method@xcite",
    "the estimation of the flavor - singlet meson mass becomes possible in quenched qcd .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the calculation of the singlet meson mass appears to be much harder in unquenched qcd , where the individual meson propagators should behave as @xmath175 here @xmath176 is the flavor - singlet ps meson operator , @xmath177 is the corresponding mass and @xmath118 is the mass of the degenerate non - singlet ps meson .",
    "since the pole of the @xmath178 appears after the leading contribution of @xmath179 is completely canceled between two diagrams , the signal becomes too noisy at large @xmath180 to extract @xmath177 .",
    "therefore one is forced to extract @xmath177 at small @xmath180 , and one usually fits the ratio of propagators as@xcite @xmath181 hoping that a large part of contributions from excited states may be canceled out in the ratio .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration@xcite indeed found that @xmath182 extracted from the ratio for @xmath183 is consistent with the one for @xmath184 , 4 within statistical errors , where @xmath185 is the minimum value of @xmath180 for the fit .",
    "recently the sesam - t@xmath172l collaboration has shown@xcite that the plateau for @xmath177 as well as @xmath118 starts at reasonably small @xmath180 , employing the smearing source .",
    "this opens a possibility for a reliable calculation of @xmath177 in very near future .    in the chiral limit one",
    "obtains a non - zero value of @xmath177@xcite , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] as a function of @xmath18 , together with the value of @xmath186 gev for @xmath73 qcd derived from the experimental value(@xmath187 ) by the witten - veneziano formula@xcite .",
    "although results from different actions seems consistent within large errors , the result from the rc(tp ) action show a systematic increase toward the continuum limit .",
    "one has to check if this large scaling violation is caused by the contamination from excited states to the ground state in the ratio @xmath188 .",
    "a new calculation with the smearing source on configurations of the cp - pacs collaboration will make it possible to extract @xmath177 reliably in the continuum limit of @xmath73 qcd , while the inclusion of the mixing to @xmath189 state@xcite as well as the dynamical strange quark will be necessary for the final result in @xmath187 qcd .",
    "we surprisingly find that hadron spectra from quenched qcd disagree in the continuum limit between ks and wilson quark actions .",
    "this discrepancy has to be resolved as soon as possible .",
    "personally i feel that some problems may exist in the identification of particles in ks quark actions , in particular of baryons .",
    "the restoration of the flavor breaking in hadron spectra might be a good check .",
    "hadron spectra from domain - wall and overlap quark actions@xcite may also give an important hint for the solution .",
    "within wilson - type quark actions , the @xmath73 dynamical quark effect on hadron spectra , in particular in meson masses , has been demonstrated .",
    "both chiral and continuum extrapolations are important to identify the effect .",
    "results for baryons suggest that the scaling violation is small but the lattice size has to be increased for reliable predictions in the continuum limit . decreasing the dynamical quark mass",
    "will also be the next challenge in unquenched simulations .",
    "the dynamical quark effect becomes manifest in some other quantities such as the string breaking , the topological susceptibility and the flavor - singlet meson mass , even at finite lattice spacing .",
    "new direction of investigations in unquenched qcd will be opened by realistic @xmath190 unquenched simulation , which is the last step to numerically solve qcd .",
    "promising algorithm for @xmath190 qcd seems hmc for @xmath73 light quarks and phmc@xcite for the @xmath191 strange quark .",
    "some results will be expected at the first lattice conference in the next century .",
