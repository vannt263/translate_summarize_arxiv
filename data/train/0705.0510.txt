    "this paper centers around the finite version of the pfaff lattice hierarchy . the pfaff lattice is a hamiltonian system , and has many connections to lattices of toda type .",
    "our goal is to show the complete integrability of the pfaff lattice , and to describe the geometry of the iso - level sets determined by the integrals of the lattice .",
    "we introduce the pfaff lattice by starting with a lie algebra splitting ( see @xcite for the semi - infinite case ) , @xmath1 here the splitting is defined by the projections of an element @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5 block diagonal part of @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) is the @xmath5 block upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) triangular part of @xmath6 , and @xmath9 is the @xmath10 matrix with the @xmath5 diagonal blocks , @xmath11 we denote @xmath12 with the involution @xmath13 .",
    "one finds that @xmath14 .",
    "each element @xmath15 is expressed by a @xmath5 block lower triangular matrix with @xmath5 block diagonal part given by @xmath16diag@xmath17 with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 represents the @xmath20 identity matrix .",
    "we also use the @xmath5 block decomposition for @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the set of @xmath5 block upper ( lower ) triangular matrices , and @xmath24 the set of @xmath5 block diagonal matrices . with the inner product on @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 , one can define the dual spaces @xmath27 and @xmath28 . with the identification @xmath29",
    ", we have @xmath30 with the projections , @xmath31 notice that both @xmath32 also @xmath33 , which gives a vector space decomposition based on the involution @xmath34 , that is , @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 is the set of @xmath5 block lower triangular matrices with block diagonal part of the form @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 .",
    "the splitting of lie algebras used here is induced by the sr - factorization of @xmath39 which is an @xmath40 version of qr - factorization .",
    "this factorization states that for a dense set of @xmath41 we can find @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 ( see theorem 3.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "however theorem 3.7 in @xcite shows that the set of @xmath46 such that the sr - factorization exists is not dense , for this reason we restrict our analysis to real matrices .",
    "remark 3.9 in @xcite states that the sr - decomposition as defined in that article is not unique ; however our choice of @xmath47 gives a unique decomposition .",
    "let us now define a matrix @xmath48 , @xmath49 in particular , we choose @xmath50 to be @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 here @xmath19 is the @xmath5 identity matrix , @xmath54 is the @xmath55 zero matrix and @xmath56 .",

    "we define a lie - poisson bracket @xmath62 for functions @xmath63 on @xmath64 using the @xmath65-matrix @xmath66 with the splitting @xmath67 : for any @xmath68 , we define the @xmath65-bracket @xmath69_{\\mathfrak g}&= \\displaystyle{[rx , y]+[x , ry]}\\\\     & = \\displaystyle { [ \\pi_{\\mathfrak k}x,\\pi_{\\mathfrak k}y]-[\\pi_{\\mathfrak{sp}}x,\\pi_{\\mathfrak{sp}}y]\\,.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the lie - poisson bracket is given by @xmath70_{\\mathfrak g}\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] the pfaff lattice for @xmath71 is defined by a hamilton equation with hamiltonian function @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73-\\pi_{\\mathfrak k^*}[\\pi_{\\mathfrak k}\\nabla h , l]\\,.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution of the pfaff lattice can be expressed as a coadjoint orbit @xmath74 through @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in general , the coadjoint orbit through @xmath78 can be written in the form , @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 . thus the coadjoint action factors into an @xmath83-action on @xmath84 and a @xmath85-action on @xmath86 .",
    "if the hamiltonian @xmath72 is @xmath83-invariant ( i.e. @xmath87\\rangle=0 , \\forall x\\in { \\mathfrak{sp}}(n)$ ] ) , one can write @xmath88 $ ] . with the hamiltonian @xmath89 ( the chevalley invariants ) , we define the pfaff lattice hierarchy , @xmath90\\quad { \\rm with}\\quad b_k=\\pi_{\\mathfrak k}(l^k)\\,,~ k=1,\\ldots,2n-1.\\ ] ] then the solutions to ( [ lax ] ) with initial condition @xmath91 evolve on the adjoint orbit of both @xmath92 and @xmath93 through @xmath91 , that is , ( [ coadjoint ] ) becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 ( we will discuss more details in section [ taufunctions ] ) .",

    "one then notes that @xmath100 from the structure of @xmath101 and the result follows .",
    "the proof of the other equations is a similar direct calculation which is left to the reader .",
    "lemma [ invariant_lemma ] implies that @xmath102 and the traces of the odd principal parts of @xmath57 , @xmath103 , are invariants of the pfaff flow ( [ lax ] ) .",
    "we choose values for these expressions so that the phase space of the pfaff lattice is @xmath104 the space @xmath105 with the lie - poisson bracket ( [ liep ] ) defines a poisson manifold , and the dimension is given by @xmath106    the form of @xmath57 is a finite version of the pfaff lattice considered in @xcite ( see ( 0.12 ) in theorem 0.1 ) .",
    "for example in the case of @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 it should be noted that @xmath57 of this form is given by a point on a @xmath85-orbit through the companion matrix @xmath109 , that is , @xmath110 for some @xmath111 and @xmath112 where the @xmath113 s are the symmetric functions of the eigenvalues , i.e. the characteristic polynomial @xmath114 .",
    "we also denote the real isospectral variety of the pfaff lattice with @xmath115 as @xmath116 where @xmath117 are the invariant polynomials defined by @xmath118 ( see ( [ fexp ] ) ) .",
    "note that the set @xmath119 are equivalent to @xmath120 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to discuss the geometric structure of @xmath121 including a complete integrability of the pfaff lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follow :    in section [ integrability ] , we discuss the integrability of the pfaff lattice .",
    "while the chevalley invariants @xmath122 are hamiltonians of the lattice , they do not provide enough integrals .",
    "we show that the additional integrals are given by the generating function @xmath123 \\ , .\\ ] ] note that @xmath124 , which generates integrals equivalent to the @xmath125 .",
    "in addition we note that @xmath126 is @xmath83-invariant , i.e. @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite to construct the casimirs and action - angle variables , with action given by the integrals generated by @xmath129 .",
    "we then define an extended jacobian associated with the spectral curve @xmath130 which has the genus @xmath131 .",
    "the extended jacobian is given by the abel - jacobi map of a vector for which @xmath132 entries are holomorphic one - forms on @xmath133 and @xmath134 entries are meromorphic one - forms on @xmath133 ( it is the presence of meromorphic one forms that makes this jacobian _ extended _ ) .    this integrability result is parallel to that of @xcite in the sense that the spectral curve @xmath135 gives the actions ( and casimirs ) , while an extended jacobian on the spectral curve gives the angles .",
    "a fundamental difference in the case of the pfaff lattice is that the spectral curve @xmath135 is singular ( proposition [ f0 ] ) .",
    "the singularities provide @xmath136 functional relations among the coefficients in @xmath129 .",
    "we then prove that the pfaff lattice is a complete integrable hamiltonian system , with @xmath137 hamiltonians and @xmath136 casimirs , in the sense of liouville - arnold ( theorem [ integrabilitythm ] ) .",
    "in section [ taufunctions ] , we review the construction of solutions to the pfaff lattice by sr - factorization of @xmath138 .",
    "the sr - factorization decomposes @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath128 .",
    "a dense set of matrices in @xmath141 possess such a factorization @xcite .",
    "solutions to the pfaff lattice are then given by @xmath142 .",
    "the sr - factorization leads to a cholesky - type factorization ( skew borel decomposition ) of the skew symmetric moment matrix @xmath143 .",
    "with the embedding @xmath144 the pfaff flow is linear on the space of skew symmetric matrices .",
    "we then define the @xmath145-function as the pfaffian of the @xmath146 principal part of @xmath147 , and the set @xmath148 generates the solutions of the pfaff lattice .",
    "we will conclude this section by working out expressions for the moment matrix and @xmath0-functions which correspond to discrete measure versions of the goe and gse random matrix models .",
    "while the goe model is a generic case of the pfaff lattice , the gse model corresponds to a degenerate case of the pfaff lattice with doubly degenerate eigenvalues .    in section [ realsolutions ]",
    "we consider generic solutions of the real pfaff lattice .",
    "in particular , we compute the fixed points of the pfaff lattice flow .",
    "these are given in the standard way by computing the asymptotic limits as @xmath149 .",
    "the result is a sorting property similar to that found for the asymptotic limits of the toda lattice hierarchy . in our case",
    "the matrix converges to a @xmath5 block diagonal structure which sorts the eigenvalues by pairs from smallest pair to largest pair as @xmath150 and largest to smallest for @xmath151 ( theorem [ asymptoticl ] ) .",
    "we then derive the explicit form of the fixed points of the pfaff lattice ( theorem [ fixedl ] ) .",
    "the total number of fixed points is shown to be @xmath152 , which is the order of the quotient @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the parabolic subgroup of the symmetric group @xmath155 associated with @xmath156 . in the case of the gse - pfaff lattice ,",
    "the number of fixed points is given by @xmath157 , the order of @xmath158 .",
    "we conclude this paper , in section [ homogeneous ] , by constructing the moment polytope to characterizes the isospectral variety of the pfaff lattice .",
    "we first note that the @xmath145 can be considered as a point in @xmath159 .",
    "we then define the moment map @xmath160 and consider the moment polytope as the image of the moment map to describe in detail the geometry of the isospectral variety .",
    "we show that in the generic case , the image of the moment map is a convex polytope described by the irreducible representation of @xmath161 on the product @xmath162 .",
    "the vertices of the polytope correspond to the fixed points of the pfaff lattice flow , and an open dense subset of the polytope is given by the generic orbits of the flow ( theorem [ isospectralpfaff ] ) .",
    "the boundaries of the polytope consist of the nongeneric orbits of the pfaff lattice which include the solutions of the kp equation . in the case of the gse - pfaff lattice ,",
    "the moment polytope is given by the permutahedron of the symmetric group @xmath158 , that is , the weight polytope associated to the full flag manifold of @xmath163 ( theorem [ gsevariety ] ) .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of the toda lattice ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we prove that the pfaff lattice hierarchy ( [ lax ] ) is a completely integrable hamiltonian system .",
    "deift , li , and tomei @xcite consider the case of the generalized toda lattice , given by the lie algebra splitting @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the borel subalgebra of lower triangular matrices with zero trace , and @xmath166 is the set of skew symmetric matrices .",
    "they showed the liouville - arnold integrability of the toda lattice by finding the full family of casimirs and action integrals , and the conjugate angles . while some of the integrals were found by considering the chops ( as in the case of the full kostant - toda lattice @xcite ) , deift , li , and tomei also introduced the spectral curve @xmath167=0,\\ ] ] for the lax matrix @xmath168 , which is invariant under the @xmath169-adjoint action , i.e. @xmath170 with @xmath171 .",
    "the coefficients of this homogeneous polynomial give the additional hamiltonians and casimirs needed to find integrability .",
    "in addition , the angles conjugate to the actions are a section of an extended jacobian of this spectral curve .",
    "our proof of integrability for the pfaff lattice equations closely follows that in @xcite , but with several unique structures .",
    "the main complications arise from the presence of @xmath136 nodal singular points on the spectral curve .",

    "in order to find the independent set of the integrals , we first note that the curve ( [ curve ] ) is singular at @xmath194 :    [ f0 ] the function @xmath195 is reducible , and is given by @xmath196 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath197 indicates the pfaffian of a skew - symmetric matrix @xmath147 .",
