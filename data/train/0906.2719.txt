    "we consider experimental synthetic dynamos  @xcite in which an @xmath2-effect is modeled by means of an external wiring , while a second induction process originates from the flow itself and takes into account the full turbulent fluctuations .",

    "the @xmath1 effect is linked to the flow differential rotation and has been extensively studied in previous experimental  @xcite and numerical works  @xcite : if a magnetic field is applied parallel to the cylinder axis by a set of coils , the fluid differential rotation induces a toroidal magnetic field . since the flow is fully turbulent ( with integral kinetic reynolds exceeding @xmath6 )",

    "the main goal of the present study is to characterize how the resulting dynamo bifurcation and magnetic field dynamics are affected when large scale properties of the von krmn flow are modified by the insertion of various appendices inside the vessel  @xcite , or when rotating the impellers at unequal rates  as a way to impose global rotation onto the flow  @xcite .",

    "the synthetic bullard - von krmn dynamo is built upon a von krmn flow .",
    "this flow is produced by the rotation of two impellers inside a stainless steel cylindrical vessel filled with liquid gallium .",

    "the impellers have a diameter equal to 165  mm and are fitted to a set of 8 blades with height @xmath8  mm .",
    "they are separated by a distance @xmath9  mm .",
    "the impellers are driven by two ac - motors which provide a constant rotation rate in the interval @xmath10 $ ]  hz . in most of the cases ,",
    "the flow is driven by symmetric forcing at @xmath11 .",
    "the system is cooled by a water circulation located behind the driving impellers ; the experiments are run at a temperature between @xmath12c and @xmath13c .",
    "liquid gallium has density @xmath14 , electrical conductivity @xmath15 , hence a magnetic diffusivity @xmath16 .",

    "magnetic induction measurements are performed using hall sensor probes inserted into the flow in the mid plane .",

    "as the flow is forced by counter - rotating impellers , the differential rotation in the fluid motion induces an azimutal magnetic field @xmath28 when an applied axial magnetic field @xmath29 is imposed by axial coils ; this is the @xmath1-effect  @xcite .",
    "this induced azimuthal field is measured from a local probe in the mid plane at @xmath30 and its value is used to drive the current source which feeds currents into the axial coils .",
    "this external amplification constitutes the @xmath2 part of the dynamo cycle , since an axial field stems from an azimuthal one .",
    "the feed - back amplification is linear ( @xmath31 up to a saturation value @xmath32 , which is the maximum current that can be drawn from the current source ) .",
    "the main component of the resulting dynamo is an axial dipole .",
    "for all available values of the rotation rate of the driving impellers , the magnetic reynolds number is low enough to be in a quasi - static approximation . in this regime , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the azimutal velocity  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 part of the dynamo cycle is thus very much dependent on the statistical properties of the velocity gradients at all scales .",
    "+ _ equatorial dipole _ + another possibility is to arrange the external coils so that they generate a field perpendicular to the rotation axis , say @xmath35 ( an equatorial dipole ) . in this case",
    "the induced magnetic field components which drive the current source is the axial induction @xmath36 measured in the mid plane at @xmath37 from the applied field .",
    "numerical studies  @xcite have shown that , in the quasi - static approximation , @xmath36 is mainly induced from @xmath35 and the radial vorticity @xmath38 of the flow via a boundary - condition effect due to the jump in electrical conductivity at the wall : @xmath39 { b}_0.\\nabla)\\omega_r$ ] , where @xmath40 $ ] is the jump in magnetic diffusivity at the vessel boundary . in the following",
    "we will refer to this mechanism as @xmath41-effect , for _ boundary - conditions effect _ , and the equatorial dipole dynamo is of @xmath25 type .    in von krmn flows ,",
    "the @xmath41-effect is particularly intense because large scale radial vortices develop in the mid plane as a result of a kelvin - helmholtz like instability in the shear layer  @xcite .",
    "these radial vortices are moreover known to have a highly fluctuating dynamics which in turn generates strong fluctuations of the @xmath41 induced field .",
    "+ _ implementation _ + for each configuration , the gain @xmath42 , of the linear amplifier which imposes the current output in the coils from the induced magnetic field value is kept constant .",
    "the control parameter being the rotation frequency of the impellers @xmath43 , we adjust the value of @xmath42 so that the critical rotation frequency for dynamo onset is @xmath44 hz . this gain is based on time - averaged values of the magnetic induction when a fixed current is imposed in the external coils ",
    "an ` open - loop ' , or induction configuration .",
    "one first measures the efficiency @xmath45 of induction at the probe location by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the time - averaged operator .",
    "then one sets the gain @xmath42 of the closed - loop conversion ( dynamo configuration ) , @xmath48 such that the estimated dynamo threshold @xmath49 is constant and equal to 8.3  hz .",
    "in other words , the gain is adjusted such that , for a given flow forcing parameter @xmath50 , the time - averaged value of the amplified induced field @xmath51 is constant whatever the flow configuration and dynamo type .",
    "saturation is set by the maximum current available from the source ; the saturated magnetic field value is of the order of a few tens of gauss . as a result ,",
    "the lorentz force is too weak to react back onto the flow field ( the interaction parameter is less than @xmath52 ) .",
    "the synthetic bullard - von krmn is thus similar to a kinematic dynamo .",
    "the scope of the present study is to investigate the influence of the flow dynamics on the behavior of the self - sustained magnetic field .",
    "modifications are achieved by changing the flow , either by inserting appendices to the inner wall of the cylinder or by driving the flow assymetrically ( _ i.e. _ rotating the impellers at different speeds ) .",
    "three geometric configurations have been tested .",
    "they are shown in figure  [ vkgeom](c , d , e ) . in the base configuration (",
    "hereafter called @xmath26 for cylinder ) there is no attachement . in configuration @xmath27 , four longitudinal baffles are attached ; they are rectangular pieces 150 mm long , 10 mm tall and 10 mm thick , mounted parallel to the cylinder axis . in configuration @xmath7 , a ring is attached in the mid - plane ; it is 15 mm tall and 4 mm thick .",
    "the respective influence of these attachments have been studied in water experiments  @xcite where it was found that they modify significantly the dynamics of the differential shear layer in the mid - plane .",
    "the presence of the ring or the baffles tends to stabilize the central shear layer ; they modify also the number and time evolution of the radial vortices in the shear layer .",
    "similarly , when the flow is driven by counter - rotating the impellers at different speeds , the flow bifurcates between 2-cells and 1-cell configurations  @xcite , hence leading to substantial modifications of the flow turbulence and large scale topology .",
    "the unbalance in the driving of the flow is measured by the ratio @xmath53 , @xmath54 corresponding to exact counter - rotation and @xmath55 to the fluid being set into motion by the rotation of one impeller only .",
    "the transition occurs at a critical value of @xmath56 above which the shear layer abruptly moves from the mid - plane to the vicinity of the slower impeller ( the flow transits then from a two counter - rotating cells geometry to a single cell geometry ) .",
    "it is associated with an abrupt change in the mechanical power required to keep the impellers rotating at fixed rates .    altogether , by inserting appendices in the flow or driving it asymmetrically",
    ", one has the possibility to vary the mean profiles and fluctuation characteristics of the von krmn flow .",
    "the impact of these changes on the synthetic @xmath5 and @xmath2-bc dynamos is studied in detail below . note that though both @xmath1 and @xmath41 effects are primarily generated by the same differential rotation , they are sensitive to different topological properties , with also different dynamical behavior of the mid - plane shear layer : the @xmath41-effect is sensitive to the radial vorticity ( @xmath38 ) in the vicinity of the vessel wall while the @xmath1-effect is sensitive to the axial change of the toroidal velocity in the bulk of the flow .",
    "the natural fluctuations of these flow gradients are known to be of different kinds : radial vorticity fluctuations are closely linked to the dynamic of strong intermittent kelvin - helmhotz vortices in the shear layer , while the axial gradient of toroidal velocity fluctuates according to local and global displacements of the shear layer .",
    "exploring both the axial and equatorial dipoles configuration give us then a way to probe selectively the impact of these velocity gradients on the dynamo .",
    "in this section , the flow is driven symmetrically : impellers counter rotate at the same rate @xmath57 .",
    "the external coils are set to generate an axial dipole field .",
    "the turbulent @xmath1-effect ( the source of the fluctuations for the dynamo ) is first analyzed as an induction process on its own .",
    "dynamical features of the @xmath5 dynamos are then described and analyzed .",
    "we first consider induction measurements obtained when a constant axial magnetic field is applied .",
    "we show the temporal dynamics of the induced field in figure  [ axialinduce](b ) , and display the probability density functions ( pdfs ) and time spectra of @xmath58 in figure  [ axialinduce](c - d ) .",
    "note that in order to compare the fluctuations for the different configurations , we have normalized the induced field by its mean amplitude in figure  [ axialinduce](c , d ) .",
    "indeed , in the dynamo loop , the value of the gain @xmath42 is adjusted so that the time - averaged amplified induced field for a fixed rotation rate is the same whatever the flow configuration .",
    "* @xmath26 configuration .",
    "the shear layer is fully developed in this less constrained state . as a result",
    ", its motion explores a large portion of the flow volume .",
    "these motions result in large variations of the amplitude of the induced field , with a quasi - gaussian statistics .",
    "the power spectrum of fluctuations in time reveals an important low frequencies dynamics .",
    "these features have been discussed in detail in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "* @xmath7 configuration .",
    "when a ring is installed in the mid - plane , the shear layer is pinned  @xcite .",
    "the axial gradient of the time - averaged azimutal velocity is peaked at the ring position @xcite and higher than in the @xmath26 configuration .",
    "the time - averaged azimutal induced field is nevertheless of the same order of magnitude in both configurations ( cf .",
    "figure  [ axialinduce](b ) .",
    "this is because the magnetic field ` filters ' the velocity gradients at a length scale of the order of the magnetic diffusion length @xmath59  cm at @xmath60 .",
    "the magnetic field is more sensitive to the difference of velocity on either side of the shear layer rather than in the actual slope of the velocity profile . +",
    "another effect is that fluctuations in the azimuthal induction are reduced due to the shear pinning .",
    "the time spectra for the two configurations are similar in the inertial range , but the presence of the ring reduces low frequency fluctuations .",
    "the slight peak at very low frequency is attributed to a ` depinning ' occuring at irregular time intervals , also observed as a bimodality in the probability density function in figure  [ axialinduce](c ) . * @xmath27 configuration . when baffles are inserted in the vessel ,",
    "vortices of the shear layer are confined to inter - baffles position and fluctuations of the shear layer are also damped  @xcite .",
    "like in the @xmath7 configuration , the time - averaged induced field is weakly modified , but fluctuations are highly reduced as compared to the @xmath26 configuration . +    for these three configurations , the mean induced field and normalized fluctuations for @xmath60 are the following : @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath7 configurations respectively .",
    "comparison of the spectra  [ axialinduce](d ) show that modifications of the flow strongly modify the low - frequency , large scale dynamics of the turbulent induction , while keeping small - scale ( inertial range ) dynamics almost unchanged .",
    "we then analyse the behavior of the synthetic @xmath5 dynamo ( _ i.e. _ when the measured azimuthal field actually drives the current in the induction coils ) .",
    "time signals of the axial magnetic field ( normalized to the maximum field ) are shown in figure  [ axialdyn ] for the three configurations and an increasing forcing parameter f ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "for the three configurations and whatever the value of the forcing parameter , the axial dipole dynamo is always observed homopolar : when growing in either polarity , the field remained of same polarity .",
    "however both polarities were observed for different realizations ( _ i.e. _ when stopping the motors and increasing the rotation rate above the critical value ) , as is expected from the @xmath63 symmetry of the mhd equations .",
    "let us first analyze the @xmath26 configuration , for which last section showed that fluctuations of the @xmath1-effect are the highest . at very low rotation rates @xmath64 , the magnetic field is null . when the rotation rate increases and approaches the threshold ( @xmath65 ) , the magnetic field remains null most of the time , but exhibits intermittent bursts . the density and duration of the dynamo state increase rapidly with the impellers rotation rate : as @xmath66 , the magnetic field in mostly non - zero , with intermittent extinctions for short time intervals .",
    "the system thus bifurcates from a non dynamo to a dynamo state via an on - off intermittency scenario , also previously observed in numerical models of the dynamo  @xcite .",
    "this kind of bifurcation is characterized by specific features of the signal : its probability density function is peaked at zero near onset and then decays algebraically ; the pdfs of ` off ' times scales as @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "evolution of the measured pdfs of magnetic field as a function of the forcing parameter is shown in figure [ axialdynonoff](a ) .",
    "the pdf is peaked at zero for rotation frequencies up to @xmath68 , and extends to large values , even at low rotation frequencies .",
    "a log - log representation is shown in inset of figure  [ axialdynonoff](a ) and shows a typical negative power - law for the pdf ( with an exponent proportional to the control parameter ) .",
    "this feature was observed in numerical simulation of on - off models  @xcite and simulations of mhd equations  @xcite . on - off intermittent signals also display an universal behavior of inter - burst time intervals , or time interval between dynamo activity , named @xmath69 - for off phases or laminar phases .",
    "this time interval is defined in the inset of figure  [ axialdynonoff](b ) : one sets a threshold and computes the time @xmath69 for which the dynamo field is below this threshold .",
    "the probability density functions of @xmath69 are displayed in figure  [ axialdynonoff](b ) for four values of the forcing parameter .",
    "these probability density functions have a power law dependence with a cut - off at large values ( the distribution of the ` off ' phases has been checked to be independent of the value of the threshold ) .",
    "a @xmath70 scaling is shown for comparison with the experimental data , showing that the data statistics is in agreement with the -3/2 power law scaling behavior predicted for on - off intermittency@xcite , observed in numerical simulations  @xcite or in experimental investigations in electronic circuits  @xcite , gas - discharge plasmas  @xcite or convection in liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the power - law scaling are not obvious , so that more complex scenarii ( such as ` in - out ' intermittency  @xcite ) may not apply here .",

    "i.e. _ when the flow has bifurcated toward the one - cell configuration , and one recovers an homopolar dynamo .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath103 regimes is of great interest since , for these regimes , the vks dynamo displayed most of its dynamical regimes ( chaotic reversals , symmetric and asymmetric bursts , oscillations ... )  @xcite . at the critical value @xmath103 , the equatorial dynamo is bipolar , bifurcates through an on - off scenario and",
    "reverses chaotically .",
    "close to the threshold value ( the @xmath104 regime is displayed in figure  [ globdyn ] ) , the dynamo also bifurcates via an on - off scenario and exhibits bursts of both polarities for a rotation rate close to @xmath88 . at higher rotation rates , reversals occurences",
    "are less frequent and the dynamo eventually reaches an homopolar regime for @xmath105 .    when the fow has bifurcated to the one - cell configuration , the equatorial dynamo is homopolar . on / off intermitency is observed in a very narrow range of driving frequencies .",
    "in the present study , influence of the flow fluctuations on synthetic bullard - von krmn dynamos has been investigated .",
    "two types of dynamo loops were studied : an @xmath5 and a @xmath25 dynamo , where the @xmath1 and @xmath41-effects incorporate turbulent fluctuations .",
    "flow fluctuations modifications have been achieved by inserting appendices in the vessel , or by driving the flow asymmetrically ( for @xmath25 dynamo ) .",
    "several robust features have been observed :    * the bifurcation occurs via an on - off intermittent regime at onset of dynamo action . *",
    "the on - off intermittent regime is controlled by the low frequency part of the fluctuating induction process considered in the dynamo loop : the higher the low frequencies of the fluctuations , the wider is the occurence of on - off intermittency among the control parameter .",
    "* for all studied configurations , the system spends half ot its time in the dynamo regime when driven at the critical forcing parameter defined on time - averaged induction processes .    however , some features strongly depend on the exact configuration . reversing dynamos",
    "have been observed only for strong fluctuations of the turbulent induction process .",
    "the low frequency part of the spectrum seems to play also a dominant role on the ability of the dynamo to reverse .",
    "hence , for this synthetic dynamo , salient features such as bursts of magnetic field activity or reversals are controlled by the underlying hydrodynamics .",
    "a detailed comparison with the dynamics of stochastic differential equations in the presence of noise is underway and will be reported elsewhere .",
