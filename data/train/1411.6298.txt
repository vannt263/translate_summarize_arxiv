    "quantum random walks , the quantum analogue of classical random walks , have been a topic of much interest lately due in large part to their many properties and applications including ( just to list a few ) : searching @xcite , subset finding @xcite , and they have been shown to be universal for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to ref @xcite for an introduction to quantum walks , and ref @xcite for a general survey .",
    "recently , several new models of history dependent quantum walks have been proposed including the quantum walk with memory @xcite , the non - repeating quantum walk @xcite , and the quantum walk with recycled coins @xcite . however , due to their relatively young age and their increased complexity , they are not as well analyzed as their non - history dependent counterparts .",
    "it is the recycled coin model that is the main topic of interest in this paper .",
    "the recycled coin model utilizes @xmath0 coin spaces ( we will restrict our attention to @xmath1 in this paper ) and a memory parameter which is a continuous variable , @xmath2 , that dictates how the coin flip operator , which acts on both coin spaces , should behave .",
    "despite this multitude of possible settings , in this paper we observe that only a few memory parameter values seem to actually induce different limiting distributions ; all others appear to induce the uniform distribution .",
    "we will observe that the initial state , the cycle size modulo four , and whether the cycle size is divisible by @xmath3 or not , all affect the limiting distribution of the walk .",
    "also , we will prove certain memory parameters produce equivalent limiting distributions depending on the initial state .",
    "finally , we will prove an interesting connection between the recycled coin model and the memory model of ref @xcite .",
    "we will prove some of our observations , and verify others numerically , leaving their proofs as very interesting open questions .",
    "a discrete time quantum walk on the cycle of size @xmath4 , ( see ref @xcite ) , operates over the hilbert space @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the position space , spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the coin space spanned by orthonormal basis @xmath9 . at each time step of the walk ,",
    "the walker , which begins in some initial state @xmath10 ( for example @xmath11 ) , undergoes the unitary evolution @xmath12 . here ,",
    "@xmath13 is referred to as the _ coin flip operator _ and it acts only on @xmath8 ( for example @xmath13 may be the hadamard operator ) ; @xmath14 is the identity operator on @xmath6 ; and @xmath15 is the _ shift operator _ which updates the walker s position based on the state of its coin space : @xmath16 that is , @xmath15 maps basis states @xmath17 and @xmath18 with all arithmetic done modulo the cycle size @xmath19 .",
    "after @xmath20 time steps , the walker is in the state @xmath21 .      in @xcite , an extension of this model , based on the memory model of @xcite",
    "was proposed : the discrete time quantum walk with memory on the cycle .",
    "now , the walker lives in the hilbert space @xmath22 ; exactly the same space as the standard model above , but with the additional memory ancilla @xmath23 .",
    "this new space is spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath9 and it is used to `` keep track '' of the previous position of the particle one time step in the past .    in greater detail , this walk evolves at each time step via the unitary operator @xmath24 where @xmath13 is the coin flip operator acting only on @xmath8 ( as before ) ; @xmath14 and @xmath25 are the identity operators on @xmath6 and @xmath23 respectively ; and @xmath26 is the shift operator which acts on basis states as follows : @xmath27    we will return to this model later .",
    "we now review the recycled coin model described in @xcite ( an extension of @xcite ) , which is our primary interest in this paper .",
    "this system operates over the hilbert space :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the @xmath31th coin space , and @xmath6 is the position space . in this paper , we are interested in studying the behavior of this walk on the cycle of size @xmath19 .",
    "we also restrict our attention to the case when there are only two coin spaces ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) ; note that even in this `` restricted '' scenario , little is known of this walk s behavior and , to our knowledge , it has not been studied on the cycle .",
    "also , by limiting our investigation to @xmath1 , we are able to compare this walk with results recently found in @xcite , which discussed the behavior of the quantum walk with memory on the cycle , discussed last section .    in this paper , each @xmath30 ( @xmath32 )",
    "is spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath33 ( when the context is clear , we will forgo writing the subscript `` @xmath31 '' ) , while the position space @xmath6 is spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath7 .",
    "initially , the walker begins in some state @xmath34 , for instance @xmath35 . at each time step , a coin flip operator is applied which affects the state of the _ active coin _ : @xmath36 ( the `` active coin , '' which is always @xmath37 , is the coin which determines the behavior of the shift operator described next ) but which acts on both @xmath38 ( this distinguishes this model from the multi - coin walk described in ref @xcite ) .",
    "let : @xmath39 be the operator which maps @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( when @xmath42 this is the hadamard operator ) .",
    "we define the coin flip operator to be : @xmath43    this coin is a slightly modified version of a more balanced one described in @xcite ; we call it an _ unbalanced coin _ and it leads to some very interesting behavior .",
    "note that , as mentioned in @xcite , there are many choices of coin flip operator and memory function . here",
    "@xmath44 is the _ memory parameter _ ; observe that , if @xmath45 , then the state of @xmath46 has no influence on @xmath47 s action on @xmath36 . indeed , in this case , the recycled coin model becomes equivalent to the multi - coin walk described in @xcite . for @xmath48 , however , the action on @xmath36 will depend on the state of @xmath46 .",
    "due to the periodicity of @xmath49 , we need only consider @xmath2 .",
    "following the coin flip operator , a shift operator is applied .",
    "this operator behaves exactly as in the standard quantum walk model ( see equation [ eq : shift ] ) ; however the action on @xmath6 depends only on the state of the @xmath36 system ; the state of @xmath46 does not matter .",
    "that is to say , @xmath36 , being the active coin , determines the direction the particle moves , the state of @xmath46 is irrelevant at this point .",
    "this shift operator will map basis states @xmath50 to @xmath51 and @xmath52 to @xmath53 where all arithmetic is done modulo @xmath19 and @xmath54 .",
    "finally , a _",
    "memory update _ operator is applied which simply swaps the active coin for the inactive one .",
    "that is : @xmath55    with these operators defined , the walk evolves over time via the unitary operator : @xmath56 where @xmath14 is the identity operator on @xmath6 .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath57 , then , after @xmath20 steps of the walk , the state evolves to @xmath58 .",
    "we are interested in two quantities .",
    "first , the probability that , after @xmath20 steps , the walker lands on position @xmath59 , provided a measurement of @xmath6 were performed .",
    "this value is :    @xmath60    where the sum is over @xmath61 , and @xmath44 is the memory parameter ( on which @xmath62 depends ) . due to the nature of the quantum walk",
    ", this function does not converge as @xmath63 @xcite ; thus , we consider also the _ time averaged distribution _ defined as :    @xmath64    which does converge @xcite .",
    "this distribution is also called the _ limiting distribution_.    note that , when the initial state is clear , or is irrelevant , we will often forgo writing the `` @xmath65 '' portion of the above functions .",
    "we now investigate the recycled coin model on the @xmath19-cycle .",
    "in particular , we are interested in understanding the behavior of @xmath66 for various memory parameters .",
    "to do so , we will use fourier analysis .",
    "this is a technique commonly used to analyze quantum walks @xcite ; in particular , we will , at first , primarily be following the example of ref @xcite , which used this method to analyze the properties of the quantum walk with memory on the cycle .      at time @xmath20",
    ", we may write the state of the walk @xmath67 as : @xmath68 = \\sum_{n=0}^{d-1}\\ket{n}\\otimes\\psi(n , t),\\ ] ] where the sum is over all @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the probability amplitude corresponding to the basis ket @xmath71 at time @xmath20 , and : @xmath72    it is clear that @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 represents the conjugate transpose of @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the trace operation , and @xmath77 is from equation [ eq : pr ] ) .",
    "we first compute @xmath78 .",
    "consider the effect of applying the coin flip operator @xmath79 to the state @xmath80 :    @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "of course , the probability amplitudes at position @xmath83 , after applying the shift operator @xmath15 , are determined only by the amplitudes at positions @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( addition modulo @xmath19 ) before the shift operator was applied . from the above equation , and recalling that the shift operator s action is determined only by the active coin - the right most in our case - it is evident that this value is :    @xmath86    where above , we have written only the relevant @xmath83 potion of the resulting state .",
    "finally , the memory update operator @xmath87 is applied yielding : @xmath88    from this , we see that we may write : @xmath89 where : @xmath90    now , consider the fourier transform of the function @xmath75 : @xmath91 from which we have : @xmath92 where : @xmath93 and , so , we have : @xmath94^t\\widetilde{\\psi}(k,0).\\ ] ]    let @xmath95 be the ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors of @xmath96 and @xmath97 be the corresponding eigenvalues",
    ". then we may write : @xmath98 and thus : @xmath99^t = \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\lambda^t_j(k,\\theta)\\ket{\\phi_j(k,\\theta)}\\bra{\\phi_j(k,\\theta)}.\\ ] ]    assuming our initial state is of the form @xmath100 , that is the particle is located only at position @xmath101 ( thus @xmath102 for all @xmath103 ) , then we have : @xmath104    changing basis , we may write : @xmath105 where : @xmath106    combining this , with equations [ eq : position - fourier ] and [ eq : mk - action ] , yields : @xmath107^t\\sum_{j=1}^4\\alpha_j(k,\\theta ) \\ket{\\phi_j(k,\\theta)}\\\\ & = \\sum_{j=1}^4\\alpha_j(k,\\theta)\\lambda_j^t(k,\\theta ) \\ket{\\phi_j(k,\\theta)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    inverting the fourier transform , we find : @xmath108    finally , the probability of measuring the particle in position @xmath83 after @xmath20 time steps ( equation [ eq : pr ] ) is :    @xmath109    from this equation , we may compute the time averaged distribution ( equation [ eq : time - avg ] ) which , after some algebra and properties of limits with finite sums , we find :    @xmath110    where @xmath111    using similar arguments as in ref @xcite ( in particular , see the proof of theorem 3.4 from that source ) , we know that : @xmath112 and therefore , equation [ eq : time - avg - closed - first ] becomes simply : @xmath113 where the sum is over all @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "we now examine how the memory parameter @xmath44 affects equation [ eq : time - avg - closed ] for various cycle sizes @xmath19 .",
    "this amounts to finding the eigensystem of @xmath96 ( equation [ eq : mk ] ) for @xmath116 , where @xmath82 .",
    "unfortunately , determining expressions for the eigensystem , for arbitrary @xmath117 , proved difficult . even in the `` simple '' case of @xmath45 ,",
    "the eigensystem is too complicated to admit any simplification ( as far as we could determine ) .",
    "a similar problem was encountered by the authors of @xcite ( even though there , they had no memory parameter to contend with ) . however , following their example , we can easily compute , numerically , the eigensystem of @xmath96 and , thus , evaluate @xmath118 .    in this section , we are interested in the following initial states : @xmath119 these are the values we set @xmath120 to when computing @xmath121 ( equation [ eq : alpha ] ) - e.g. , @xmath122 .",
    "we will clearly state which initial state we use for which graphs in the following .",
    "our initial results , for various memory parameters , initial states , and cycle sizes , are shown in figure [ fig : init - graphs ] and there are many interesting observations to make .",
    "first , there is a relationship between various memory parameters , depending on the initial state :    [ thm : first ] let @xmath123 be the matrix : @xmath124 for all @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and initial states @xmath127 , let @xmath128 , then : @xmath129    recall that @xmath130 .",
    "this implies that @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath132 and @xmath133 , then we may write @xmath96 and @xmath134 ( equation [ eq : mk ] ) as :    @xmath135    @xmath136    let @xmath137 be an eigenvalue of @xmath96 with corresponding eigenvector @xmath138 .",
    "thus : @xmath139    we claim @xmath137 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath134 with corresponding eigenvector @xmath140 . indeed : @xmath141 where the last equality follows from equation [ eq : ev1-mk0 ] .",
    "thus , let @xmath142 and @xmath143 for all @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are eigenvalues and ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors of @xmath96 .",
    "it is clear that , for every @xmath148 , it holds : @xmath149 from the above analysis , these @xmath150 and @xmath151 are eigenvalues and ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors of @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath152 be the starting state for the walk with memory parameter @xmath153 .",
    "then , from equation [ eq : alpha ] , we have : @xmath154    from this , along with equation [ eq : thm1-eq1 ] , we may conclude that @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 .",
    "of course the above theorem also implies , trivially , that the limiting distributions are also equal .",
    "that is : @xmath158 where @xmath128 .",
    "since we typically restrict the memory parameter to be in the interval @xmath159 ( due to the periodicity of @xmath96 ) , we may take the value of @xmath153 to be modulo 8 .",
    "in particular , we have the following identities :    1 .   @xmath160 .",
    "2 .   @xmath161 .",
    "3 .   @xmath162 .",
    "other memory parameters , which do not obey the relationship required by theorem [ thm : first ] ( i.e. , those @xmath163 ) , do not necessarily induce equivalent distributions . for instance , figure [ fig : init - graphs ] ( b ) shows that it is not necessarily the case that @xmath164 .",
    "they produce different distributions , but we can compute the statistical distance between these two distributions to determine how different they are .",
    "that is , we are interested in the value : @xmath165 for various initial states and cycle sizes @xmath19 .",
    "this distance is shown in figure [ fig : stat - dist ] . when the initial state used was @xmath166 , we observe that the difference between the distributions induced by memory parameter @xmath45 and that induced by @xmath167 decreases as @xmath19 increases",
    ". the behavior was also affected by the residue of the cycle size , modulo @xmath168 .",
    "if @xmath19 is divisible by @xmath168 , there was no difference ( equation [ eq : stat - dist - mem ] was zero ) ; by theorem [ thm : first ] , this would imply memory parameters @xmath169 produce identical distributions for cycles of this size . if @xmath170 for some @xmath171 , the difference was greatest .",
    "second greatest was @xmath172 , though the distance was almost the same as when @xmath173 .",
    "see figure [ fig : stat - dist ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "when using initial state @xmath174 and @xmath175 we get a very different result . here , as the cycle size @xmath19 increases , the difference between the two distributions does not decrease .",
    "this was for all @xmath19 we tested ( even @xmath19 divisible by four ) .",
    "furthermore , the residue of @xmath19 modulo @xmath168 played a less prominent roll in the statistical distance for these two initial states ( different residues produced different results , however it was a very slight difference and so was not plotted in these graphs ) .",
    "see figure [ fig : stat - dist ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "these are all numerical observations : we have no proof of these leaving this as potentially very interesting future work .",
    "our next observation , and perhaps most interesting , is that for any memory parameter @xmath176 or @xmath177 , and for any initial state @xmath120 , we observed that the time averaged distribution is uniform if the cycle size @xmath19 is not divisible by 12 .",
    "if the cycle size is divisible by @xmath3 , then all memory parameters @xmath178 , or @xmath177 produced a uniform distribution ( see figure [ fig : graphs12 ] for the case when @xmath179 ) .",
    "these observations we were unable to prove , however we did verify it for all cycle sizes @xmath180 and initial states @xmath181 , and @xmath175 . for this verification , we computed , for each of the four initial states , equation [ eq : time - avg - closed ] numerically for all @xmath182 and @xmath183 for @xmath184 .    to ensure that we were not merely running into numerical approximation errors , we also simulated the walk for various @xmath19 and memory parameters , estimating @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "that is , we did not use equation [ eq : time - avg - closed ] , but instead applied @xmath62 ( equation [ eq : evolve ] ) sequentially , calculating @xmath187 directly for each @xmath188 and averaging these , thus providing an estimate of @xmath185 .",
    "this simulation confirmed our results .",
    "we did notice , however , that the parameter did have an effect on the convergence time , or _ mixing time _",
    "see figure [ fig : mixingtime ] .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : init - graphs ] ( d ) betrays a third possible behavior of this walk model : for initial state @xmath174 and memory parameter @xmath189 , the limiting distribution appears to be uniform for all odd cycle sizes .",
    "we verified this for all odd @xmath190 .",
    "as a consequence of theorem [ thm : first ] , a similar statement may be made for initial state @xmath175 and memory parameter @xmath45 .",
    "note , however , that this did not hold for even cycles ( for either @xmath174 or @xmath175 ) .",
    "of course , as mentioned , the value of @xmath44 would probably affect the _ mixing time _ of the distribution - a quantity which depends on the difference between non - equal eigenvalues : the closer the eigenvalues are to one another , the longer it takes for the distribution to converge to its limiting distribution @xcite . analyzing this",
    "further would be interesting ; however , it seems that , in order to progress further in this direction , a simplified expression for the eigenvalues would be required .    in summary",
    ", we observe that the behavior of the recycled walk on the @xmath19-cycle depends on the following :    1 .   the memory parameter @xmath2 ; however , we proved that for certain initial conditions , certain memory values induce the same distribution . also , we observed ( without proof ) that only @xmath191 potentially produced non - uniform behavior .",
    "if this is true , then , combining this with theorem [ thm : first ] , this tells us we need only focus on memory parameters @xmath192 .",
    "2 .   the size of the cycle , modulo @xmath168 affects the distribution .",
    "if the size of the cycle is divisible by @xmath3 , this also appears to affect the distribution .",
    "in particular , if the cycle size is not divisible by twelve , memory parameters @xmath193 seem to produce the uniform distribution ( this is not proven ) . if true , then , combining with theorem [ thm : first ]",
    ", only memory parameters @xmath194 require further investigation ( when @xmath19 is not divisible by @xmath3 ) .",
    "the initial state also affects the distribution .",
    "we stress that , with the exception of theorem [ thm : first ] , these are observations which we were only able to verify numerically .",
    "though the memory model of @xcite , using a hadamard coin operator , and the recycled coin model @xcite , using the unbalanced coin from equation [ eq : coin - flip ] , are seemingly quite different , we encountered an interesting relationship between the two while performing our analysis . to distinguish between the memory model and the recycled coin model , when referring to the former , we shall always write any mathematical definition with a subscript @xmath195 .",
    "for example , the probability of the particle being measured in position @xmath83 after time @xmath20 is given by @xmath196 ; the state of the quantum walk in the memory model is @xmath197 ; and so on .    with this notation",
    ", we observed , and now prove , an interesting relationship between the two models :    [ thm : second ] let @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath120 be an initial state for the recycled coin walk .",
    "let @xmath198 be the following permutation matrix : @xmath199 then it holds that @xmath200 for every @xmath201 .",
    "of course this implies @xmath202 trivially .    in ref @xcite",
    ", the authors , using fourier analysis , showed : @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 are the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the matrix : @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "we claim that , if @xmath167 ( thus @xmath208 ) , then for every @xmath144 and @xmath145 , it holds that @xmath209 and @xmath210 where @xmath198 is the permutation matrix from equation [ eq : perm ] , and @xmath204 , @xmath205 is an eigensystem of @xmath211 .",
    "let @xmath132 and @xmath133 , then we may write @xmath96 ( equation [ eq : mk ] ) as : @xmath212    we may also write @xmath211 as : @xmath213    consider one of the eigenvectors of @xmath211 , @xmath214 and write it as @xmath215 . since @xmath216 is its corresponding eigenvalue , it holds that : @xmath217    now let @xmath218 .",
    "we show this is an eigenvector of @xmath96 with eigenvalue @xmath219 : @xmath220 combining this with equation [ eq : nk - eigensystem ] , we find : @xmath221 because @xmath222 , it is clear that , for every @xmath223 and @xmath224 , it holds : @xmath225    in particular , this shows us that the @xmath95 are orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath96 .",
    "if we let the initial state of the memory walk be @xmath226 , then using equation [ eq : alpha ] : @xmath227    combining all of this , it is clear that @xmath228 ( equation [ eq : pr - memory ] ) is exactly equal to @xmath229 ( equation [ eq : pr ] ) for every @xmath201 and @xmath20 .",
    "for example , if the initial state used , for both the recycled coin model and the memory model , is @xmath230 these walks will produce exactly the same distribution if memory parameter @xmath167 is used .",
    "thus , to analyze the quantum walk with memory model on the cycle , one may instead analyze the recycled coin model with parameter @xmath167 and a potentially different initial state . or vice versa",
    ". it might be that one model yields more easily to further analysis than the other .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the recycled coin discrete time quantum random walk model on the cycle .",
    "our analysis shows that this model s behavior depends in very interesting ways not only on the memory parameter , a continuous value in the range @xmath159 , but also on the initial state , and the size of the cycle - in particular whether the cycle size is divisible by @xmath3 or not ( compare figure [ fig : init - graphs ] with figure [ fig : graphs12 ] ) ; also on the residue of the cycle size modulo four ( see figure [ fig : stat - dist ] for how this residue affects certain distributions ) .",
    "our analysis showed that , despite a seemingly wide range of possible behaviors , due to the additional memory parameter @xmath2 , there seem to be only a few cases of interest : in particular , only integer values of @xmath44 seem to potentially produce non - uniform distributions ( non - integer values of @xmath44 producing a uniform time averaged distribution ) .",
    "of these integer values , only a few need be considered .",
    "in particular , if the cycle size @xmath19 is divisible by @xmath3 , then we observed only values @xmath231 produced non - uniform behavior .",
    "if @xmath19 is not divisible by @xmath3 then only @xmath232 produced a non - uniform distribution .",
    "this is a conjecture we verified for @xmath180 and we leave the proof as an open problem .",
    "however , we note that , due to theorem [ thm : first ] , only a few of these cases need to be considered : @xmath192 in the first case , and @xmath194 in the second .    even if the limiting distribution is uniform for all non - integer values of @xmath44 as mentioned above",
    ", this memory parameter most likely influences the mixing time , as we mentioned last section . deriving a relationship between these two quantities , the parameter and the mixing time ,",
    "could be potentially useful , and certainly interesting .",
    "our efforts to prove these last few points were hampered , however , by our inability to derive a simplified expression for the eigenvalues of @xmath96 ( equation [ eq : mk ] ) . without these , we are impeded in this direction ; perhaps an alternative method of proof may be required .",
    "finally , we only considered one type of coin flip operator - as mentioned in ref @xcite , there are a multitude of ways to relate the memory parameter with a coin flip operator .",
    "the one described in equation [ eq : coin - flip ] was similar to one first mentioned in @xcite and so seemed a good place to start .",
    "it might be useful to consider others in the future - perhaps results similar to our theorems [ thm : first ] and [ thm : second ] can be discovered linking the distributions , produced by these different coin operators , in some manner .",
