    "note that , depending on the electric intensity , with the growth of the moderate @xmath8 the maximum can increase , as panel ( a ) and data from the table demonstrate . as the number of bosons becomes sufficiently large , the domination of the statistical effects starts to reveal itself leading to the formation from the resonance of an asymmetric cusp - like structure with its right side leaning more vertically with the increasing @xmath8 .",

    "the ground orbital will be completely depopulated at @xmath217 what means a full destruction of the be condensate by the warming of the structure but due to the finiteness of @xmath8 a tiny field - dependent fraction @xmath213 persists for the temperatures above the critical one . to emphasize the role of the varying field in the process of",

    "that , in addition to the above two conditions , is valid for the large @xmath8 .",
    "the infinite heat capacity at the critical temperature that follows from the latter formula is due to the neglect of the higher - order terms , which , if included into the consideration , smooth out the heat capacity peak to the finite field - dependent magnitude , as exact calculations depicted in fig .  [ boseneglambdafig1](a ) demonstrate . the cusp - like structure of the heat capacity that was predicted theoretically for a number of the confining potentials @xcite and observed experimentally for , e.g. , the dilute bose gas of @xmath223 atoms @xcite , for the infinite number of particles , @xmath216 , turns at @xmath224 into the discontinuity that is a manifestation of the phase transition ; in our case , it is a transition from the be condensate to the normal phase of the noninteracting particles in the linear potential .",
    "this justifies the definition of the critical temperature from eq .  .",
    "there has been a lively discussion of the influence of the shape and dimensionality of the confining potential on the existence , form and evolution of this feature @xcite .",
    "as our results show , the sharpness of the resonance can be effectively controlled by the voltage applied to the attractive robin surface . for comparison ,",
    "[ boseposlambdafig1 ] shows the heat capacity and ground - level occupation of the repulsive wall at the quite strong and very weak fields .",
    "it is seen that in terms of the scaled temperature @xmath218 the shape of the curves is practically independent of the electric intensity .",
    "the increasing number of bosons leads to the formation of the maximum of the specific heat at @xmath225 but , contrary to the attractive surface , this extremum does not grow to infinity rather saturating to the value lying below 2 .",
    "contrasting the results of the negative and positive robin walls shows once again the crucial role of the split off level in the dramatic evolution of the thermodynamic properties .",

    "a theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the robin wall in the perpendicular electric field @xmath1 discovered that the heat capacity of the attractive surface for the canonical and either type of the grand canonical ensemble exhibits a pronounced maximum with its peak increasing at the vanishing voltage as @xmath4 while the corresponding temperature goes to zero as @xmath229 .",
    "this phenomenon that is absent for the repulsive interface is explained by the peculiarities of the associated energy spectrum ; namely , at @xmath230 it is characterized by the quasi continuum of the positive - energy states and , additionally , the split off level with @xmath231 @xcite . at the cold temperatures ,",
    "the heating of structure enforces the transitions from this orbital to a huge number of the higher lying states leading in this way to the giant enhancement of the specific heat @xmath46 . increasing number @xmath8 of the fermions decreases the extremum while for the be distribution for the quite large @xmath8 the resonance changes into the cusp - like structure , which is a manifestation of the phase transition into the condensate regime with the critical temperature being strongly @xmath1- and @xmath8-dependent .",
    "thus , the applied voltage allows to effectively control the thermodynamics of the robin quantum wall .",
    "having seen the dramatic evolution of the thermodynamic properties predicted above , one might wonder about their experimental verification . in the previous analysis of the attractive field - free robin wall @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that this model approximates the piecewise continuous potentials that can be grown by the modern semiconductor technologies .",
    "consider , for example , the term @xmath22 in eq .   of the form ( below we return to the regular units ) : @xmath232 with positive @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "it is elementary to show that , in addition to its positive spectrum , this asymmetric qw can support bound states with their number depending on the interrelation between @xmath234 and @xmath233 ; for example , each new localized level @xmath35 emerges from the positive continuum at the following threshold magnitude of @xmath234 : @xmath235 it means that for @xmath234 satisfying the condition @xmath236 only one negative - energy state does exist . as a result , this potential forms zero - field energy spectrum complying with all the requirements of the present research .",
    "accordingly , applying to it appropriately directed voltage , it is possible to check the heat capacity enhancement discussed above .",
