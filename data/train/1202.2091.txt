    "in heavy - ion collisions above 2 tev the density of minijets produced by semihard scatterings of partons can be so high that conventional treatment of such collisions may be inadequate .",
    "what is conventional at lower energy ( 0.2 tev ) is hydrodynamical description for transverse momentum @xmath2 gev / c @xcite and jet fragmentation at @xmath3 gev / c @xcite . in the intermediate region",
    "neither approach is reliable .",
    "the unconventional treatment based on quark recombination has shown some success in filling the gap @xcite .",
    "conceptually , one can imagine that at extremely high energies , higher than what is available at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , heavy - ion collisions can be so explosive with a preponderance of minijets that hydrodynamics would be invalid even at low @xmath1 on the one hand , and absence of jet - jet interaction would be unreasonable at moderate @xmath1 on the other .",
    "the question is what the reality is at lhc where charged particle distribution is already known up to @xmath4 gev / c @xcite .",
    "an answer can not be given without some model - dependent analysis .",
    "our aim in this paper is to find the degree of importance of multijet recombination in the formation of hadrons .",
    "recently , the spectra of identified hadrons in pb - pb collisions at lhc for @xmath5 gev / c have been studied @xcite ; it is found that the recombination of thermal and shower partons is important down to @xmath6 gev / c .",
    "it means that there is an abundance of minijet produced at @xmath7 gev .",
    "the basic parameters ( @xmath8 , inverse slope of thermal partons , and @xmath9 , a measure of the momentum degradation of semihard partons ) are determined by fitting the data on @xmath10 and @xmath11 distributions simultaneously . with those parameters at hand",
    ", we can then extend the study to higher @xmath1 with sufficient constraint to confront the data on charged hadrons .",
    "low - energy jets with transverse energy @xmath12 gev are not the sort of objects that can be identified by jet - finding algorithms , such as hija @xcite , for heavy - ion collisions because they merge into the backgrounds from high - multiplicity underlying events in search for jets with @xmath13 gev @xcite .",
    "separation of neighboring minijets is not only unfeasible , but probably not meaningful .",
    "a discussion of jets usually starts with a definition of what the minimum energy in a jet cone @xmath14 is after background subtraction , and what the radius of the jet cone @xmath15 is .",
    "it is based on the concept that particles in a jet are correlated with the initiating hard parton , and can be isolated from the background by an effective algorithm .",
    "the task for accomplishing that becomes more and more difficult as the jet energy is reduced because of the fluctuation of the background . from the point of view of @xmath1 distribution that is averaged over all pseudorapidity @xmath16 and azimuthal angle @xmath17 ,",
    "at least in a midrapidity interval , say @xmath18 , and over all events , the background is the dominant part that is exponential . small deviation from that part at a slightly larger @xmath1 reveals the effect of semihard scatterings that can not be easily identified on the event - by - event basis as well - defined jets in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , we need to focus on them in order to calculate their effect on the @xmath1 distribution . for that purpose",
    "we use the term minijet without being precise about @xmath19 and @xmath20 , since we shall not examine the event structure in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plot .",
    "we do consider semihard partons with transverse momenta @xmath21 gev / c and the shower partons that they generate after emerging from the medium surface .",
    "each such semihard parton and the cluster of associated shower partons will be referred to as a minijet .    in heavy - ion collisions",
    "there are various theoretical issues related to minijets that have not yet evolved to a mature subject with general acceptance .",
    "the medium effects on semihard partons are important but hard to make precise , and the hadronization process is still controversial .",
    "the shower partons not only depend on the degree of momentum degradation in the medium , but also have various channels of hadronization , such as through recombination with thermal partons on the one hand and with other shower partons on the other . at lhc",
    "the high density of jets creates the possibility of shower partons from different jets overlapping in common spatial proximity so that their coalescence can not be ignored .",
    "the study of multi - minijet contribution to the hadronic @xmath1 distribution and to two - particle correlation is the main concern of this paper in addition to the usual components involving single jets .",
    "we shall examine all possible components so as to exhibit the relative importance of each up to @xmath0 gev / c . from @xmath22",
    "tev with known charged - particle spectra , we extrapolate to 5.5 tev to show how the multi - minijet contributions depend on collision energy .",
    "although we can calculate the minijet contribution to the hadronic spectra , it is difficult to conclude from the observed @xmath1 spectra that minijets are necessarily existent . to make that conclusion cogent , two - particle correlation exhibited in terms of transverse rapidities has been used experimentally to show the existence of a broad peak @xcite .",
    "we shall analyze our calculated results in those variables and show general agreement with the data .",
    "thus there is common ground in recognizing the important role that minijets play in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , our approach differs from the experimental approach in that we provide the partonic basis of the observed phenomenon . at low @xmath1 where correlation is strongest",
    ", thermal partons play an important role despite the fact that they are by themselves uncorrelated .",
    "that is because two shower partons from one jet are correlated by momentum constraints , so their separate recombination with different thermal partons results in hadronic correlation .",
    "thus @xmath1 correlation among particles that are not too far apart in pseudorapidity @xmath16 and azimuthal angle @xmath17 is a fertile ground to find the footprints of recombination .",
    "our study here is limited to midrapidity in central collisions and all our formulas are averaged over the azimuthal angles . as will become self - evident",
    ", the theoretical description that includes all components of hadronization ( e.g. , 7 components for proton production ) is sufficiently complicated that it becomes essential to build first a clear and solid foundation for the physical processes without involving the azimuthal complexities .",
    "we shall use schematic diagrams to help the visualization of the various processes .    in the next two sections we describe the multijet recombination processes for pions and protons .",

    ", the coalescence process clearly can not take place if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not nearly equal , since non - parallel partons have large relative momentum transverse to @xmath50 .",
    "large relative longitudinal momentum parallel to @xmath50 is permitted in the parton model , since the momentum fraction of a parton in a hadron can vary from 0 to 1 .",
    "relative momentum transverse to that is limited by the confinement restriction that it should not exceed the binding energy of the constituents .",
    "one may consider a gaussian distribution in @xmath51 with an appropriate width .",
    "however , since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are integrated over in eq .",

    "since the partons are emitted from the medium at early times , we may consider the emitting system as being a thin almond - shaped overlap region viewed from its side in the same transverse plane at midrapidity as where the pion is detected .",
    "for centrality @xmath53 the almond is almost circular .",

    "it is then clear that those peaks are at @xmath153 and 1.1 gev / c , respectively , although they can not be easily identified in the plots of @xmath154 .",
    "it is informative to compare the magnitudes of the minijet contributions to @xmath129 and @xmath131 with the contributions from thermal partons only .",
    "the former are summarized by sum - s depicted by solid blue lines in figs .",
    "8(a ) and ( b ) and are reproduced by the same line type in fig .",

    "except for @xmath156 , sum - s is larger than tt and ttt , although for the latter the proton rf suppresses all components .",
    "the implication of this result is that the effect of minijets on hadronic spectra is dominant over essentially all @xmath1 .    in the two - component model",
    "@xcite a separation of the hadronic spectra into soft and hard components is carried out by demanding that the soft component has a specific form , viz .",
    ", a lvy distribution in @xmath138 . what remains after the subtraction of that is the hard component , which is characterized ( apart from a centrality factor ) by a universal function @xmath157 that is gaussian in @xmath139 , exhibiting a peak at @xmath158 .",
    "the region around the peak is regarded as being dominated by minijets .",
    "the separation is done at the hadronic level , working with observed data on pion and proton production at rhic .",
    "what we have done in this article is to work at the partonic level , finding many ways in which the shower partons can contribute to hadrons , viz .",
    ", in terms of ts , ss , etc .",
    "when the resultant hadronic distributions without the soft tt components are plotted in @xmath139 , we find the peak originally found in refs",
    "thus there is phenomenological agreement on what may be identified as minijet , although the avenues of approaches to that common ground are quite different . in particular , we assume the thermal parton distribution to be exponential that can give a good description of both pions and protons at low @xmath1 when combined with sum - s .",
    "we calculate the shower parton distribution but use a cut - off to keep the unreliable part at very low @xmath96 from exceeding the thermal distribution .",
    "our hadronization scheme treats fragmentation as a part of recombination ( ss and sss ) , and includes cross terms ts , tts and tss explicitly .",
    "furthermore , by working with the transverse momenta @xmath96 of the partons we have additivity that yields the hadronic @xmath1 directly .",
    "it is a simple property that relates partons to hadrons , but is lost in @xmath139 .",
    "it should finally be noted that , since the tt and ttt components in fig .  10 show peaks in @xmath139 without any contributions from shower partons , any claim on the existence of minijets can not be made convincingly without exhibiting correlation , a subject to be considered in sec .",

    "since both pion and proton distributions at large @xmath1 are higher at 5.5 tev compared to those at 2.76 tev , the @xmath163 ratio is not significantly changed ; both are shown in fig .",
    "the peak is shifted slightly lower to around @xmath164 gev / c .",

    "the peaks occur at around the same values of @xmath139 ; however , the magnitudes are much higher  nearly triple .",
    "notice that ( ss)@xmath25 is now as high as ( ss)@xmath24 , while ( tss)@xmath25 exceeds ( tss)@xmath24 . at both 2.76 and 5.5 tev , the sums of all shower parton contributions ( shown by the solid blue lines in figs .",
    "8 and 14 ) are significantly higher than the ( ss)@xmath151 and ( sss)@xmath151 contributions that do not involve the thermal partons .",

    "( [ 4.1 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "16(a ) for collisions at 2.76 tev , exhibiting clearly that the correlation is important only when @xmath89 and @xmath90 are in the 1 gev / c region .",
    "the most important contribution to that correlation in the peak region comes from the ( ts)(ts ) term in fig .",
    "3(a ) that involves two shower partons produced by a single semihard parton .",
    "that cluster of partons with low transverse momenta is what has been referred to as minijet , and the correlation is among the components of that cluster , but for correlation between pions there is a gain in momentum due to recombination of the correlated shower partons with thermal partons in the vicinity .",
    "the properties near the correlation peak can best be shown in a plot of @xmath167 in fig .",
    "the peak is located at @xmath168 .",

    "compared to @xmath87 correlation in fig .",
    "16 , the magnitude of @xmath88 correlation is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the peak in @xmath170-@xmath171 is shifted to slightly higher value at @xmath145 .",
    "the above results are our best theoretical evidence for minijets .",
    "there are , of course , jets produced at all higher @xmath1 . however , since inclusive two - particle distribution involves integration over the parton momenta @xmath172 , higher-@xmath1 jets would not show up unless cuts in @xmath1 are made to select those jets . when that is done , one should be able to obtain peaks in the autocorrelation on the angular - difference variables @xmath173 and @xmath174 , observed in the data @xcite and calculated in @xcite .",
    "a summary of our findings in this section is that the peaking of two - particle correlations in @xmath87 and @xmath88 distributions provides indisputable evidence for minijets whose correlated shower partons are responsible for the phenomenon , as observed in @xcite . without particle identification ,",
    "the correlation is due mainly to the process depicted in fig .",
    "two - jet recombination is of negligible effect in correlations .",
    "we have calculated the hadronic spectra for meson and baryon production in pb - pb collisions at lhc for @xmath1 in the range 0 - 16 gev / c .",
    "of particular concern in this work is the investigation of the extent to which multi - jet recombination is important in that @xmath1 range , since jet density is high at lhc .",
    "we have found that at 2.76 tev the ( ss)@xmath25 component in meson production makes negligible contribution at all @xmath1 compared to other components which are primarily tt and ts at low @xmath1 , and then ( ss)@xmath24 for @xmath152 gev / c . for baryon production ( sss)@xmath25 is comparable to ( sss)@xmath24 at @xmath175 gev / c , so jet fragmentation alone in the conventional sense is not reliable at such low @xmath1 .",
    "recombination involving t is more important for @xmath176 gev / c ; in particular , ( tss)@xmath151 components with @xmath177 and 2 have comparable magnitudes , either one being larger than ( sss)@xmath151 . since that is the low-@xmath1 region where the @xmath178 ratio is of the order of 1 , the two - jet contributions to the inclusive spectra should not be ignored .",
    "the effect of 2-j recombination to the two - hadron correlation is , however , negligible .",
    "it is not surprising that at 5.5 tev the effect of multi - minijet contribution becomes more important . for proton production ( tss)@xmath25 is as large as ( tss)@xmath24 for @xmath179 gev / c and ( sss)@xmath25 is comparable or larger than ( sss)@xmath24 for nearly all @xmath1 . at @xmath180 gev / c all components except ttt and ( sss)@xmath135 are approximately similar in strength .",
    "thus we predict that any calculation without 2-jet recombination would not be able to reproduce the data .",
    "we have shown by studying the single - particle distributions in @xmath139 that there are peaks at @xmath144 and 2.8 for @xmath129 and @xmath131 , respectively , verifying what has been observed experimentally by star @xcite . because of the definition in @xmath139 at low @xmath139 , a gaussian distribution in @xmath139 does not unambiguously indicate the existence of minijets . however ,",
    "when two - particle correlation exhibits a broad peak in @xmath139-@xmath139 distribution , then the inference of minijets is inevitable .",
    "what we have shown is that the peak in @xmath139-@xmath139 receives its dominant contribution from ( ts)(ts ) in the case of @xmath87 correlation , and from ( tts)(tts ) in @xmath88 correlation .",
    "that is our explanation of the data on that peak observed by star @xcite . the corresponding value of @xmath1 where the peak is located is around 1 gev / c .",
    "thus the minijets that give rise to the shower partons have a significant effect on low-@xmath1 physics through thermal - shower recombination .",
    "the dominance of the role played by minijets in the low-@xmath1 region puts a new light on the subject of soft physics , since the conventional treatment by hydrodynamics does not take minijets into account explicitly .",
    "it raises the question on whether the non - flow component can ever be ignored at high collision energies , especially at lhc .",
    "so far we have examined only @xmath17-averaged distribution in @xmath1 for central collisions .",
    "the problem that lies ahead is clearly the study of azimuthal anisotropy for non - central collisions .",
    "it is there that we must confront the lhc data on @xmath181 @xcite , and clarify the roles of minijets versus the fluctuations of initial - state configurations , both of which appear to have similar effects on the final - state hadronic observables .",
