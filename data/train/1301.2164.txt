    "metamaterials are artificial materials that can be engineered to exhibit fascinating electromagnetic properties that do not occur in nature , such as negative refractive index , `` perfect '' imaging and electromagnetic cloaking @xcite , chiral metamaterials have shown giant optical activity @xcite , circular dichroism @xcite , negative refraction @xcite , and possible reversal of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "most of the applications critically required an negative index of refraction in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "it is an open question , whether there is any 3d metamaterial design working for optical frequencies still feasible to fabricate . here",
    ", we theoretically proposed a new design that provides negative index of refraction with one surface and can be used to fabricate 3d metamaterials .",
    "this is an important step towards the realization of bulk 3d at optical wavelengths .",
    "previous theoretical designs @xcite obtain nim in 3d at ghz and thz .",
    "two groups independently proposed fully isotropic bulk magnetic metamaterial designs , based on srrs arranged in a cubic lattice by employing spatial symmetries @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some designs of 3d isotropic nims exist , but fabricating them has remained a challenging task and virtually impossible at optical frequencies . for example , koschny et al .",
    "@xcite , designed an early example of an isotropic nim . however , high - constant dielectric assumed across the gaps of the srrs rendered the experimental realization impractical .",
    "alternative approaches have also been investigated , including direct lasing fabrication @xcite , and high refractive index spheres @xcite .",
    "double negative index materials exhibit simultaneously negative magnetic permeability , @xmath1 , and electric permittivity , @xmath0 , over a common frequency range @xcite .",
    "negative permeabilities are the result of a strong resonant response to an external magnetic field ; negative permittivity can appear by either a plasmonic or a resonant response ( or both ) to an external electric field .",
    "pendry et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a double metallic srr design for negative @xmath1 and a parallel metallic wire periodic structure to give negative @xmath0 .",
    "several variations of the initial design have been studied @xcite .",
    "for example , a single ring resonator with several cuts has been proven capable of reaching negative @xmath1 at a higher frequency @xcite , and cut wire pairs and fishnet structures @xcite allow for a negative magnetic response at optical frequencies . in these old designs ,",
    "it needs two particles , one particle gives negative @xmath1 and the other gives negative @xmath0 at the same frequency range .",
    "later , rockstuhl and lederer proposed a new design@xcite , nanoapertures embedded in a continuous metal film , that gives @xmath2 from the metallic surface and a resonant @xmath1 , which , however , did not reach @xmath3 because of the weak resonance .",
    "since the imaginary part of @xmath1 is large , @xmath4 and @xmath2 will give negative index of refraction@xcite .",
    "it@xmath5s very interesting to develop a new design that will use only one `` particle '' on one surface that will provide negative index of refraction and also @xmath3 and @xmath2 , with parallel direction on the surface .",
    "we will use babinet@xmath5s principle @xcite to obtain a complementary structure in a metallic surface that will give @xmath3 for the first time , instead of @xmath6 resulting from babinet - complementary resonators studied in the previous literature , with perpendicular direction on the surface .",
    "in addition , the remaining continuous metallic surface will give @xmath2 .",
    "1    2    babinet@xmath5s principle has been used @xcite to design artificial planar metamaterials , which can provide only negative electric permittivity .",
    "such inverse elements , like complementary srrs ( csrrs ) , have been proposed as an alternative to conventional metallic wires for the design of planar metamaterials , which give @xmath2 .",
    "complementary metamaterials show @xcite similar properties as their inverse structures . the transmission coefficient , @xmath7 , for the csrr is related to the transmission coefficient , @xmath8 , for the srr by @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , according to babinet@xmath5s principle , their transmission and reflection behavior , as well as their scattered electric and magnetic fields , are interchanged @xcite .",
    "these complementary designs provide an effective negative permittivity , @xcite with perpendicular direction . in this manuscript",
    ", we will use babinet@xmath5s principle to design complementary structures that will provide an effective negative permeability and the metallic surface to give negative permittivity . therefore , we will obtain negative @xmath10 with only one planar metamaterial , with parallel direction of the surface of planar metamaterial .    3",
    "babinet@xmath5s principle relates the fields scattered by two complementary planar structures of arbitrary shape made of infinitely thin , perfectly conducting sheets .",
    "if we consider an incident electromagnetic ( em ) field , @xmath11 , then its complementary em field , @xmath12 , is defined @xcite as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which corresponds to a rotation around the propagation axis .",
    "if we have a thin metallic surface , the reflected ( @xmath15 ) and the transmitted ( @xmath16 ) electric and magnetic fields satisfy the following conditions .",
    "if we have charge on the thin metallic surface , the perpendicular reflected electric field is opposite to the transmitted electric field , i.e. , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the axis vector perpendicular to the metallic surface .",
    "the parallel electric field is continuous to both sides of the thin metallic surface , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "if the incident em wave generates current in the thin metallic surface , the perpendicular magnetic field is continuous , i.e. , @xmath20 and the parallel magnetic field is opposite to the two sides of the metallic surface , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "if we have a perfectly conducting surface , no magnetic dipole occurs in the plane due to this condition @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , no electric dipole occurs perpendicular to the plane , due to the condition @xmath22 .",
    "however , in - plane electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles perpendicular to the plane are possible .",
    "due to the babinet principle , we have two related complementary plane structures .",
    "the surface charge in one structure is related to the magnetic flux in the complement and the opposite occurs . the magnetic flux is related to the surface charge .",
    "also , the parallel electric field in the plane can be generated , surface electric current perpendicular to the electric field ( see examples below ) .",
    "in particular , this means a resonance in one structure is related to a corresponding resonance in the dual fields in the complementary structure . in a",
    ", we have a thin metallic rectangular patch .",
    "the propagation direction of the em field is perpendicular to the metallic patch and the electric field , @xmath23 , is parallel to the long side of the rectangular patch .",
    "we have created an electric dipole in the y - direction of a. the electric current , @xmath24 , is along the direction of @xmath23 and the magnetic flux is shown in a. in b , we presented the babinet - complementary structure , where we have a thin metallic surface and a rectangular hole .",
    "as discussed above , the surface charge shown in a can be transformed to the magnetic flux .",
    "the positive ( negative ) charge , shown in a , can be related to the magnetic flux going inside ( outside ) the metallic surface ( see b ) .",
    "the magnetic flux of a can be related with the charge of b. another example , shown in a , is the metallic srr .",
    "we present the current , the charge and the magnetic flux . in a",
    ", we have a strong magnetic dipole along the propagation direction of the em wave .",
    "there is also a minor electric dipole in the srr gap .",
    "this dipole moment is responsible for the bianisotropy of the srr . in b",
    ", we present the complementary structure , and used the idea of exchanging surface charge and magnetic flux .",
    "we do not have a magnetic dipole in the complementary srr ( csrr ) , but there is an electric dipole , due to the neck of csrr , parallel to the neck .    4     + ( a)(b ) +     + ( a)(b ) +   + ( c)(d ) +    in a , we have a new metallic design that gives an electric dipole and the complementary design gives a residual magnetic dipole shown in b , for perpendicular direction on the metallic surface .",
    "in the previous section we reviewed the babinet principle for different designs ( figures [ fig1][fig3 ] ) and the complementary designs . these designs ( figures [ fig1][fig3 ] ) can help us understand how the electric dipole on the metallic film is related to he magnetic dipole of the `` complementary '' design .",
    "we can use these ideas of babinet@xmath5s principle to use metallic surface to give @xmath2 and @xmath3 and will have negative index of refraction , @xmath25 .    in a",
    ", we present a new metallic design that has no electric dipole but a resonant electric quadrupole moment . considering at first normal incidence , the complementary structure show in b will possess a resonant mode with a residual magnetic dipole moment perpendicular to the plane as consequence of babinet@xmath5s principle .",
    "we have thus established the correspondence of a resonant electric quadrupole mode in the `` octopus '' structure to a resonant magnetic dipole mode in the complementary structure .",
    "the babinet principle allows us to map fields between the corresponding resonances of mutually complementary structures .",
    "therefore , after indentifying the resonances of the babinet complement , we can elect to excite these resonances in a different geometry of incidence .    now leaving the original babinet setup behind",
    ", we realize that the correspondence of the two resonant modes in the direct and complementary structure , i.e. , the derived `` translation rule '' of local charges , currents and flux distributions on the surface , has to hold for any external excitation . in",
    "order to couple to the magnetic dipole of the complementary structure ( b ) we thus change the propagation direction to be parallel with the surface such that the magnetic field of the incident wave can couple to the ring current ( i.e. the magnetic dipole ) and we can obtain a negative @xmath1 . notice the charges are shown in the `` legs '' of this design .",
    "the current goes around and provides a magnetic dipole , which can give a negative permeability .",
    "in addition the metallic surface ( b ) will give negative permittivity , @xmath0 .",
    "this complementary design can help us to understand how to obtain negative @xmath1 and negative @xmath0 .",
    "the design shown in overlap with @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the impedance @xmath26 is very large and we have a lot of reflection and low transmission . deforming the structure while maintaining the same principle topology of , we did a lot of simulations for different designs to have very low impedance ( @xmath27 for air ) and to have very high transmission .",
    "we find a new design ( see ) which satisfies the criterion @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and they have @xmath28 and @xmath29 the same magnitude .",
    "we will use an alternative design to obtain negative @xmath1 and the metallic surface will give negative @xmath0 at the same frequency region , and the magnitude of @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be comparable , and the impedance to be close to 1 . in a , we present a complementary design , which has a big hole in the metallic surface that will give a negative @xmath1 .",
    "this structure is on a @xmath30 thick copper sheet with lattice constant @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in b , we plot the current density , which gives a circular current and provides magnetic dipole momentum .",
    "we have used the design of a , to obtain transmission , reflection , and absorption @xmath33 with the cst .",
    "we simulated a periodic array of the proposed structures .",
    "with propagation direction parallel to the metallic surface , we have used the amplitude and the phase of transmission and reflection to obtain the frequency dependence of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath10 through the retrieval procedure @xcite .    in , we plot the transmission , t , and reflection , r , and absorption , a , versus the frequency . at the frequency",
    "9.9 ghz , there is dip in the reflection . in the retrieval results ,",
    "we obtain negative @xmath10 with only one metallic surface with the appropriate hole design .",
    "the hole design gives negative @xmath1 and the metallic surface gives negative @xmath0 , the impedance is close to one , and the transmission is close to @xmath34 .",
    "the figure of merit ( fom = @xmath35re(n)/im(n)@xmath35 ) is 9 with @xmath36 with frequency 9.9ghz .",
    "the @xmath37 with @xmath38 with frequency 9.95ghz .",
    "this is a unique design that gives negative @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with only one metallic surface .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown it is possible to construct babinet - complement structures ( holes in planar metamaterials ) that provide a resonant magnetic moment perpendicular to the screen .",
    "we use such a magnetic resonance providing @xmath3 together with the @xmath2 coming from the electric background provided by the continuous regions of the screen , to obtain a double negative index metamaterial for propagation direction parallel to the screen . in this material , both @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are provided by the same single component .",
    "these designs can be used to fabricate three - dimensional metamaterials and obtain negative index of refraction at microwave and infrared wavelengths .    _",
