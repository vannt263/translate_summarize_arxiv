    ", @xmath5 can not be interpreted as the probability of simultaneously measuring observables @xmath6 and @xmath7 with eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 : such dispersion - free values for non - commuting observables are not allowed in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , @xmath4 can even be _ negative _ in some phase - space regions , something that obviously could not happen were @xmath4 a true probability distribution ( hence the term _ _",
    "quasi-__probability ) .",
    "the connection between negativity of @xmath4 and non - classicality has not been completely fleshed out , partly due to different subjective views on what qualifies as ` non - classical behavior ' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "negativity of @xmath4 has been linked to non - locality @xcite , but the relation is not straightforward .",
    "for example , the original einstein - podolsky - rosen state can display non - locality despite having positive @xmath4 in all phase space @xcite .",
    "buot @xcite and hannay and berry @xcite seem to have been among the first to propose analogues of the wigner function for finite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "their finds were rediscovered later by cohen and scully @xcite and feynman @xcite , who defined a discrete wigner function @xmath0 for the case of a single qubit .",
    "this work was developed by wootters @xcite and galetti and de toledo piza @xcite , who introduced a wigner function for prime - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "there followed other definitions valid for dimension @xmath1 which is odd @xcite , even @xcite , power - of - prime @xcite , or arbitrary @xcite .",
    "these have been recently used to visualize and get insights on teleportation @xcite , quantum algorithms @xcite , and decoherence @xcite .",
    "a recent review of phase - space methods for finite - dimensional systems is given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper i investigate the relation between negativity of discrete wigner functions and quantum computational speedup .",
    "i will focus on the class of wigner functions defined by wootters @xcite and gibbons _",
    "@xcite for power - of - prime dimensions .",
    "wigner functions in this class are defined by associating lines in a discrete phase space to projectors belonging to a fixed set of mutually unbiased bases .",
    "we will see that the set of states displaying negativity of @xmath0 depends on a number of arbitrary choices required to pick a particular definition of @xmath0 from the class .",
    "i eliminate this arbitrariness by characterizing the set @xmath2 of states having non - negative @xmath0 simultaneously in _ all _ definitions in the class , for @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space .    for a single qubit",
    ", i show that the set @xmath10 consists of states which fail to provide quantum computational advantage in a model recently proposed by bravyi and kitaev @xcite . for dimensions @xmath11 ,",
    "i show that the set @xmath2 is the convex hull of a set of _ stabilizer _ states , i.e. simultaneous eigenstates of generalized pauli operators @xcite .",
    "this is interesting , as quantum computation which is restricted to stabilizer states and gates from the clifford group can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer @xcite .",
    "if the result holds for arbitrary power - of - prime dimensions ( as i conjecture ) , then pure states in @xmath2 would be ` classical ' in the sense of having an efficient description using the stabilizer formalism .",
    "this suggests that states with negative @xmath0 may be _ necessary _ for exponential quantum computational speedup with pure states .",
    "in this section we review the discrete wigner functions introduced by wootters @xcite and galetti and de toledo piza @xcite for prime dimensions , and elaborated on recently by wootters @xcite and gibbons , hoffman and wootters @xcite for prime - power dimensions .",
    "we start by defining discrete analogues of phase space and its partitions into parallel ` lines ' ( i.e. , _ striations _ ) .",
    "then we review how to define a class of discrete wigner functions @xmath0 by associating lines with projectors onto basis vectors from a set of mutually unbiased bases ( mub s ) .",
    "the discrete analogue of phase space in a @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space is a @xmath12 real array . unlike the continuous phase space , in this discrete",
    "setting we do not have geometrical lines of points . instead , a ` line ' is defined as a set of @xmath1 points in discrete phase space .",
    "it is clear that our discrete phase space can then be partitioned in multiple ways into collections of parallel lines ( i.e. disjoint sets of @xmath1 phase - space points ) . following wootters @xcite , we call each such partition a _ striation_.    in @xcite a procedure for building @xmath13 striations of a @xmath14 phase - space array was outlined , resulting in striations with the following three useful properties :    i : :    given any two points , exactly one line contains both points;[pstria1 ] ii : :    given a point @xmath15 and a line @xmath16    not containing @xmath15 , there is exactly one line    parallel to @xmath16 that contains    @xmath15;[pstria2 ] iii : :    two non - parallel lines intersect at exactly one point .",
    "[ pstria3 ]    the construction of these @xmath13 special striations involves labeling the discrete phase space with elements of finite fields , and defining lines using natural properties of the field ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "these striations play a central role in the definition of the discrete wigner function @xmath0 , as we will see below .",
    "wootters definition of discrete wigner functions makes use of a special set of @xmath17 bases for a @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "consider two different orthonormal bases @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 these two bases @xmath18 and @xmath19 are said to be _ mutually unbiased _ , or _ mutually conjugate _",
    ", if @xmath21    wootters and fields showed that one can define @xmath13 such mutually unbiased bases ( mub s ) for power - of - prime dimension @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "note that this is exactly the number of striations one can find with properties * i*-*iii * above ; we will use this now to define a class of discrete wigner functions _",
    "w_.      we now have the ingredients to define a class of discrete wigner functions : a set of @xmath13 mutually unbiased bases @xmath22 ; and a set of @xmath13 striations @xmath23 of our @xmath12 phase space into @xmath1 parallel lines ( i.e. disjoint sets ) of @xmath1 points each .",
    "to define a discrete wigner function we need to choose two one - to - one maps :    * each basis set @xmath24 is associated with one striation @xmath25 ; and * each basis vector @xmath26 is associated with a line @xmath27 ( the @xmath28th line of the @xmath29th striation ) .    with these associations ,",
    "the wigner function @xmath0 is uniquely defined if we demand that @xmath30 i.e. we want the sum of the wigner function elements corresponding to each line to equal the probability of projecting onto the basis vector associated with that line .",
    "note that there are multiple ways of making these associations . in general",
    ", this will lead to different definitions of @xmath0 using the same fixed set of mub s .",
    "the procedure outlined above then leads not to a single definition of @xmath0 , but to a class of wigner functions instead .",
    "let us illustrate wootters definition of a discrete wigner function with the simplest case , a qubit .",
    "the discrete wigner function @xmath0 is defined on a @xmath31 array : @xmath32    there are three striations of this phase space with properties * i , ii * and * iii * as required .",
    "below i list them , using numbers @xmath33 to arbitrarily label the two lines @xmath27 in each striation @xmath25 : @xmath34    now we need to define a set of 3 mutually unbiased bases for a qubit . these can be conveniently chosen as the eigenstates of the three pauli operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "let us label these basis vectors @xmath26 , where @xmath37 indexes the mub ( @xmath38 respectively for the operators @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 indexes the basis vector in each mub ( @xmath33 indicates eigenstates with eigenvalues respectively equal to @xmath41 ) .",
    "we can now define @xmath0 by imposing condition ( [ defw ] ) , i.e. we want the sum of @xmath42 in each line @xmath16 to be the probability @xmath43 of projecting the state onto the basis vector @xmath26 : @xmath44    using the three striations we defined , these conditions can be explicitly stated , in terms of the probabilities @xmath43 : @xmath45    the equations above define uniquely the wigner function @xmath0 in terms of the probabilities @xmath43 : @xmath46    here we should keep in mind that not all probabilities @xmath43 are independent , as the sum over any mub must add up to @xmath47 ( i.e. @xmath48 ) .    from the definitions ( [ w2a])-([w2d ] ) we can immediately read the conditions for non - negativity of the wigner",
    "function : @xmath49 because of the conditions @xmath50 , there are only three free variables in the inequalities above .",
    "we can thus pick one @xmath43 for each mub @xmath29 ( say , @xmath51 ) , and represent states by points in this three - dimensional probability space .",
    "this representation is equivalent to the more familiar bloch sphere , with the advantage of generalizing easily to power - of - prime dimension @xmath1 . in that case",
    "( to be discussed in section [ sechighd ] ) , there are a total of @xmath52 independent probabilities @xmath43 describing any mixed quantum state .",
    "note that the probabilities @xmath43 combine linearly for convex combinations ( probabilistic mixtures ) of quantum states , a consequence of the linearity of the trace in eq .",
    "( [ trformula ] ) .    the inequalities ( [ ip2a])-([ip2d ] ) for non - negativity of @xmath0 are satisfied by state @xmath53 if and only if @xmath54 lies inside the tetrahedron @xmath55 ( see figure [ fig pqubitpoly ] ) .",
    "by contrast , there exist quantum states whose @xmath0 is negative in some phase - space points , i.e. lying outside of tetrahedron @xmath56 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig pqubitpoly ] , where the set of points corresponding to quantum states is the ball of radius @xmath57 and with center @xmath58 .",
    "tetrahedron in @xmath59 space representing states with non - negative wigner function @xmath0 , for the definition of @xmath0 given by eqs .",
    "( [ w2a])-([w2d ] ) .",
    "the ball represents one - qubit quantum states.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let me draw attention to two features of the set of states with non - negative @xmath0 .",
    "first , there exist points @xmath60 which do not correspond to any one - qubit quantum state ( e.g. @xmath61 ) .",
    "we must also keep in mind that there were arbitrary choices involved in the particular definition of @xmath0 that we picked .",
    "we have chosen arbitrary one - to - one maps between mub s and striations , and also between lines in a striation and basis vectors . in the next section",
    "we take these two points into account , defining a set which consists solely of quantum states , and for which the wigner function is non - negative for _ all _ definitions of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section i use negativity of @xmath0 to define the set @xmath2 of states in @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space having non - negative @xmath0 for all definitions of @xmath0 based on a fixed set of mub s .",
    "i will then argue that single - qubit states in @xmath10 behave ` classically ' in a concrete computational sense .",
    "having fixed a set of 3 mub s for a single qubit , wigner functions @xmath0 can be defined in a number of ways , corresponding to the @xmath62 different associations between lines and basis vectors , and between striations and mub s . for each of these @xmath63",
    "wigner function definitions we can do as above , and find the set of points in @xmath54-space for which @xmath0 is non - negative .",
    "a simple calculation shows that depending on the definition , this set is either the original tetrahedron @xmath56 or the tetrahedron whose vertices are the other four @xmath54-cube vertices : @xmath64 .",
    "now i define the set @xmath2 of states in @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space which i will argue behave ` classically ' in a computational sense :    definition : : :    the set @xmath2 is defined as the states in a    @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space whose wigner function    @xmath0 is non - negative in all phase space points _ and _ for    all definitions of @xmath0 using a fixed set of mutually    unbiased bases .    in the remainder of this article",
    "i will characterize the set @xmath2 for some small dimensions @xmath1 , and discuss the limitations of doing quantum computation solely with states in @xmath2 .    for a qubit , the set @xmath10 is given in @xmath54-space as the intersection of the two tetrahedra @xmath56 and @xmath65 presented above .",
    "this corresponds to an octahedron inscribed inside the ball of quantum states : @xmath66 ( see figure [ fig octa ] ) .",
    "we see that set @xmath10 can be characterized in a simpler way as the set of states which are convex combinations of the six basis vectors of the three chosen mub s : @xmath67    octahedron in @xmath59 space representing states with non - negative wigner functions @xmath0 for all definitions of @xmath0 using a fixed set of mutually unbiased bases.,title=\"fig : \" ]    there are at least two motivations for considering the set @xmath10 , as opposed to states with non - negative @xmath0 in a single definition ( the sets @xmath56 or @xmath65 ) .",
    "the first one is the realization that a priori there is no preferred definition of @xmath0 from the full class of definitions , and any concept of ` classical states ' based on non - negativity of @xmath0 should be definition - independent .",
    "the second motivation only became apparent after we calculated @xmath10 : unlike the sets @xmath56 and @xmath65 , all states in @xmath10 are physical states , i.e. obtainable from measurements on a single qubit .",
    "in the next section we will review other properties of @xmath10 from a computational perspective .      in the last section i defined the set @xmath10 of single - qubit quantum states which have non - negative @xmath0 in all definitions of @xmath0 using a fixed set of mub s .",
    "let us now review an argument for the ` classicality ' of the set @xmath10 , from a computational point of view .",
    "recently bravyi and kitaev @xcite proposed the following model of computation .",
    "imagine that for some reason there are a few quantum computational operations which we can perform perfectly  let us denote these by @xmath68 .",
    "in addition to those , some operations in set @xmath69 can only be performed imperfectly .",
    "now let us consider a particular choice for @xmath68 :    * prepare a qubit in state @xmath70 ( i.e. , an eigenstate of the @xmath36 operator ) ; * apply unitary operators from the clifford group ( such as the hadamard and cnot gates ) ; * measure an eigenvalue of a pauli operator ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) on any qubit .    the gottesman - knill theorem @xcite states that the operations in @xmath68 above can only create a restricted set of states known as _ stabilizer states _ , i.e. simultaneous eigenstates of the pauli group of operators .",
    "moreover , such operations do not allow for universal quantum computation , and can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer .",
    "in addition to these perfect operations , bravyi and kitaev proposed a set @xmath69 with a single extra imperfect operation :    * prepare an auxiliary qubit in a mixed state @xmath71 .    in this model of computation , it is easy to see that auxiliary qubits in states @xmath72 can not be used to perform universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "states in @xmath10 are linear convex combinations of the six eigenstates of single pauli operators . as such , they can be prepared efficiently from operations in @xmath68 , namely , clifford gates to obtain any pauli eigenstate deterministically from the initial @xmath36 eigenstate , together with classical coin tosses to prepare them with the appropriate weights given by the desired convex combination .",
    "these are operations that can be efficiently simulated on a classical probabilistic computer .",
    "this justifies my ` classicality ' claim for states in @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , in @xcite it was shown that some ` non - classical ' states @xmath73 can be used to attain universal quantum computation in this model .",
    "the basic idea is to use auxiliary pure states outside of @xmath10 to implement gates outside of the clifford group , using operations in @xmath68 only .",
    "a single generic non - clifford gate together with the set of clifford gates allows for universal quantum computation .",
    "this procedure works also for a large class of mixed states @xmath74 , through a distillation of pure non - stabilizer pure states from @xmath75 using clifford operations only @xcite .",
    "this enables us to identify non - stabilizer states as a resource which can be tapped to implement non - clifford gates and achieve universal quantum computation .",
    "this idea was first suggested by shor @xcite , and has since been elaborated on by other authors @xcite .",
    "we can follow gibbons _ et al . _ and define a discrete wigner function @xmath0 whenever the hilbert space dimension @xmath1 is a power of prime . in this section",
    "i use the definition of @xmath2 to characterize this set for states in small hilbert space dimensions @xmath1 .    in @xmath1 dimensions , the probability - space point @xmath54 describing each state",
    "has @xmath52 components . requiring non - negativity of @xmath0 for all definitions will correspond to a set of inequalities for @xmath54 , each delimiting a half - space where @xmath0 is non - negative at a particular phase - space point , and for a particular definition of wigner function .",
    "states in the set @xmath2 are those which satisfy all these inequalities , constituting a convex polytope .",
    "any convex polytope admits two descriptions , one in terms of the half - space inequalities ( h - description ) , and one in terms of its vertices ( v - description ) .",
    "the set @xmath2 is , by definition , an h - polytope . for one qubit",
    "we have found the equivalent v - description : there are @xmath76 vertices corresponding to the @xmath76 basis vectors of the three mub s used to define @xmath0 .",
    "let us now see how to find the equivalent v - description for the h - polytope @xmath2 defined above .",
    "the starting point is the general expression for the @xmath1-dimensional wigner function at phase - space point @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath77,\\label{eqwgen}\\ ] ]    where the sum is over the probabilities associated with projectors corresponding to all lines @xmath27 containing phase - space point @xmath15 . by construction of the striations , each point belongs to exactly one line from each striation .",
    "thus for each point @xmath15 , the sum above has @xmath13 terms @xmath43 , one from each mub .",
    "we want to find which conditions on @xmath43 correspond to the demand of non - negativity of @xmath78 for all points @xmath15 _ and _ for all definitions of @xmath0 using a fixed mub set . for a fixed phase - space point @xmath15 , changing the definition of @xmath0 will correspond to picking a different set of @xmath13 probabilities @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eqwgen ] ) , one from each mub @xmath29 .",
    "there are only @xmath79 ways of doing so , and this is the total number of expressions for @xmath78 which we would like to take only non - negative values .",
    "these @xmath79 inequalities of the form @xmath80 constitute our h - description of the polytope @xmath2 .    from this h - description",
    "it is possible to find the equivalent v - description using a convex hull program based on the quickhull algorithm @xcite . while this is considered to be a computationally hard problem in general , it was possible to do the calculation for @xmath3 .",
    "the results are similar to the one - qubit case .",
    "for @xmath81 and @xmath82 i found that the v - description of @xmath2 has @xmath83 vertices , each corresponding to one of the mub basis vectors used to define @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath84 , for example , the h - polytope @xmath85 in @xmath86-dimensional @xmath54-space is delimited by @xmath87 half - space inequalities corresponding to non - negativity of @xmath0 in all definitions .",
    "the v - description of this polytope consists of exactly @xmath88 vertices , each corresponding to one of the basis vectors of the six mub s .",
    "it is not hard to see that the mub basis vectors have non - negative @xmath0 in every single definition of @xmath0 using those basis vectors . for @xmath3 , the computation described above shows that these are the only pure states for which this is true for all definitions , and moreover that the mixed states with the same property are exactly their convex combinations . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the implications for quantum computing .",
    "given the results above for @xmath89 and @xmath82 , it is natural to make a conjecture :    conjecture : : :    for any power - of - prime hilbert space dimension @xmath1 , the    polytope @xmath2 is equivalent to the v - polytope whose    vertices are the basis vectors of the mub s used to define    @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to show that the latter v - polytope is contained in @xmath2 ; the converse seems to be harder to prove for general power - of - prime @xmath1 .",
    "to understand the relevance of this conjecture for quantum computation , we need to review some known facts about mutually unbiased bases .",
    "various authors have come up with constructions of mub s @xcite .",
    "for @xmath90 ,",
    "i.e. for the case of @xmath91 qubits , the corresponding basis vectors can always be written as simultaneous eigenstates of tensor products of single - qubit pauli operators @xcite .",
    "more generally , for any power - of - prime dimension @xmath1 the mub basis vectors can be chosen to be eigenstates of generalized pauli operators @xcite .",
    "in other words , the basis vectors of mub s can always be chosen to be a set of stabilizer states .",
    "the conjecture would then mean that for any @xmath1 , the set @xmath2 would be the convex hull of the particular subset of stabilizer states used as basis vectors of the mub s .",
    "pure - state quantum computation which is restricted to states in @xmath2 would then only ever reach the mub basis vectors , all of which admit an efficient classical description using the stabilizer formalism .",
    "as i have already remarked , it is well - known that quantum computation that is restricted to pure stabilizer states and gates from the clifford group is not universal , and can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer @xcite . if the conjecture holds , then a wide class of unitary dynamics restricted to pure states inside @xmath2 would be easy to simulate on a classical computer  for example , any gate from the clifford group .",
    "this suggests that non - trivial pure - state quantum computation may require states outside of @xmath2 , i.e. having negative wigner function @xmath0 in at least some of the definitions of @xmath0 in the class proposed by gibbons , hoffman and wootters @xcite .",
    "in this paper i related the negativity of the discrete wigner function @xmath0 with quantum computational speedup .",
