    "differential geometry has a close relationship with the theory of integrable systems .",
    "in fact , many integrable differential or difference equations arise as compatibility conditions of some geometric objects .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the compatibility condition of pseudospherical surfaces gives rise to the sine - gordon equation under the chebyshev net parametrization . for more information on such connections",
    "we refer to a monograph @xcite by rogers and schief .",
    "the above connection between the differential geometry of surfaces and integrable systems has been known since the nineteenth century ( although the theory of integrable systems was not yet established ) .",
    "however , it is curious that the link between the differential geometry of curves and integrable systems has been noticed rather recently .",
    "actually lamb@xcite and goldstein and petrich @xcite discovered an interesting connection between integrable systems and the differential geometry of plane curves .",
    "namely , they found that the _ modified korteweg  de vries equation _ ( mkdv equation ) appears as the compatibility condition of a certain motion of plane curves . here",
    "a motion of curves means an isoperimetric time evolution of arc - length parametrized plane curves .",
    "more precisely , the compatibility condition implies that the curvature function of a motion should satisfy the mkdv equation . as a result",
    ", the angle function of the motion satisfies the _ potential modified korteweg ",
    "de vries equation _ ( potential mkdv equation ) .    on the other hand , in the theory of integrable systems ,",
    "much attention has been paid to discretization of integrable differential equations preserving integrability , after the pioneering work of ablowitz and ladik@xcite and hirota@xcite .",
    "later , date , jimbo and miwa developed a unified algebraic approach from the view of so - called the kp theory@xcite .",
    "for other approaches to discrete integrable systems , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "thus one can expect the existence of discretized differential geometric objects governed by discrete integrable systems .",
    "this idea has been realized by the works of bobenko and pinkall@xcite and doliwa@xcite where the discrete analogue of classical surface theory has been proposed , and it is now actively studied under the name of discrete differential geometry@xcite .    in the case of the discrete analogue of curves , doliwa and",
    "santini studied continuous motion of discrete curves in the 3-sphere , and obtained the ablowitz ",
    "ladik hierarchy in @xcite , where a semi - discrete ( discrete in space variable and continuous in time variable ) analogue of the mkdv equation is derived as the simplest case .",
    "their formulation includes the plane curves as a limiting case .",
    "et al _ proposed a discretization of arc - length parametrized plane curves@xcite , and obtained another semi - discretization of the mkdv equation .",
    "hoffmann and kutz@xcite considered discretization of the curvature function . by using their discrete curvature function and mbius geometry , they obtained a semi - discrete mkdv equation that is the same as the one in @xcite .",
    "the discretization of the time variable of discrete curve motion in the 3-sphere was studied in @xcite , where the evolution corresponded to the discrete sine - gordon equation@xcite .",
    "as is well known , binormal motion of space curves induces the nonlinear schrdinger equation via hasimoto transformation @xcite .",
    "discretization of this curve motion has been formulated in @xcite .",
    "recently one of the authors of the present paper formulated a full discretization of the motion of plane discrete curves@xcite in a purely euclidean geometric manner , where the discrete potential mkdv equation proposed by hirota@xcite is deduced as the compatibility condition .",
    "it admits a natural continuous limit to the potential mkdv equation describing continuous motion of a smooth plane curves .    in the smooth curve theory ,",
    "the potential function coincides with the angle function of a curve , a primitive function of the curvature .",
    "however , in the discrete case , the potential function and the angle function become different objects . in this framework",
    ", the primal geometric object is the potential function rather than the curvature ( see @xcite and section 2 of the present paper ) .",
    "natural and systematic construction of the discrete motion of the curves is expected by using the theory of discrete integrable systems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct explicit solutions to discrete motion of discrete plane curves by using the theory of @xmath0 functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we prepare fundamental ingredients of plane curve geometry and motions ( isoperimetric time evolutions ) of plane curves described by the potential mkdv equation .",
    "next we give a brief review of the discrete motion of discrete curves@xcite . in section 3",
    ", we shall give a construction of motions for both smooth and discrete curves by the theory of @xmath0 functions .",
    "more precisely we introduce a system of bilinear equations of hirota type , which can be obtained by a certain reduction of the discrete two - dimensional toda lattice hierarchy@xcite",
    ". we shall give a representation formula for curve motions in terms of the @xmath0 function .",
    "one of the central topics in classical differential geometry is the transformation theory of curves and surfaces .",
    "the best known example might be the bcklund transformations of pseudospherical surfaces .",
    "the original bcklund transformation was defined as a tangential line congruence satisfying the _ constant distance property _ and _ constant normal angle property _ ( see @xcite ) . in plane curve geometry ,",
    "bcklund transformations on arc - length parametrized plane curves can be defined as arc - length preserving transformations satisfying the constant distance property .",
    "such transformations can be extended to transformations on smooth curve motions via the transformation of solutions to the potential mkdv equation . motivated by this fact",
    ", we shall introduce bcklund transformations for discrete motion of discrete curves in section 4 ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "in particular we shall give another type of bcklund transformation on motions of both smooth and discrete curves , which is related to the discrete sine - gordon equation .",
    "in section 5 , we shall construct and exhibit some explicit solutions of curve motions , namely , the multi - soliton and multi - breather solutions .",
    "we also present some pictures of discrete motions of discrete curves .",
    "we finally give some explicit formulas for the bcklund transformations of both smooth and discrete curve motions via the @xmath0 functions .",
