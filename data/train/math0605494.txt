    "in this paper , continuing the work in  @xcite and  @xcite , we investigate tropical polytopes , the natural tropical analogue of ordinary polytopes in euclidean space .",
    "we give examples of strange behavior in this genus of objects and ponder their facet descriptions ; we also describe how tropical polytopes embody a family of resolutions of monomial ideals , which includes the hull complex of  @xcite .    the _ tropical semiring _",
    "is given by the real numbers @xmath0 together with the operations of tropical addition @xmath1 and tropical multiplication @xmath2 , defined by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a tropical semi - module under tropical addition @xmath1 ( which is taking the componentwise maximum of two vectors ) and tropical scalar multiplication @xmath2 ( which is adding a constant to each coordinate ) .",
    "it proves more convenient to mod out by tropical scalar multiplication and work in _ tropical projective space _ @xmath6 , where we will typically choose the coordinatization given by @xmath7 .",
    "the _ tropical convex hull _ of a set of points @xmath8 in tropical projective space , denoted @xmath9 , consists of all tropical linear combinations of those points ( not just those with coefficients between 0 and 1 , as 0 and 1 have no meaning in tropical land ) .",
    "a _ tropical polytope _ is the tropical convex hull of a finite set of points ; it consists of all tropical linear combinations @xmath10 .",
    "tropical polytopes have a natural decomposition as complexes of ordinary polytopes ; see  @xcite for more details .",
    "some examples of tropical polytopes are shown in figure  [ examples ] .",
    "they enjoy many useful properties , such as being contractible and having a tropical farkas lemma hold .",
    "this tropical farkas lemma says that any point not in a tropical polytope can be separated from that polytope by a tropical hyperplane .",
    "a _ tropical hyperplane _ is given by a linear form @xmath11 ; this form is said to vanish if the maximum encoded by this tropical expression is achieved at least twice , and the corresponding tropical hyperplane is defined to be the locus of vanishing .",
    "this is a fan with apex @xmath12 , and is polar to the simplex given by the convex hull of the standard basis vectors @xmath13 ( of which there are @xmath14 living in @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , each tropical hyperplane divides @xmath15 into @xmath14 _ sectors _ indexed by the @xmath14 coordinates ; see figure  [ hyperpl ] .",
    "a point @xmath16 lies in the ( closed ) sector indexed by coordinate @xmath17 if @xmath18 is maximized among all @xmath19 .",
    "note that all hyperplanes are translates of each other , meaning that all that is needed to specify a hyperplane is its apex",
    ".    one manner in which tropical ( discrete , algebraic ) geometry arises naturally is as the image of ordinary ( discrete , algebraic ) geometry over the puiseux series field with real exponents @xmath20 $ ] under the degree map @xmath21 sending an element to its leading ( highest ) exponent .",
    "( sometimes it proves more convenient to define @xmath22 as the puiseux series field with rational exponents , in which case the tropical objects in @xmath5 or @xmath15 are the topological closures of the images of the lifted objects in @xmath23 . ) in fact , tropical polytopes are images of polytopes in @xmath23 .",
    "we will discuss this point of view in section [ puiseux ] , and as an application , we will present a family of cellular resolutions of monomial ideals in section [ resols ] .",
    "michael joswig , in his seminal paper  @xcite , used these hyperplanes to propose a face structure of tropical polytopes ; in section [ faces ] , we investigate this structure and raise some issues with it , presenting an alternate definition which is both more intuitive and more practical .",
    "we will discuss more examples in section [ sec : ex ] and future directions in section [ sec : future ] .",
    "let @xmath24 $ ] be the puiseux series field with real exponents , as defined above .",
    "it is naturally an ordered field , where @xmath25 if the leading coefficient of @xmath26 is positive ; its positive elements @xmath27 comprise the set of all elements with positive leading coefficient . as such ,",
    "the usual theory of discrete geometry applies in @xmath23 , and in particular we can define the convex hull of a point set as the set of all affine combinations of the points .",
    "indeed , tropical polytopes are simply the images of objects up above :    [ convlift ] suppose @xmath28 , where each @xmath29 has first coordinate zero .",
    "define lifts @xmath30 such that all leading coefficients of the @xmath31 are positive , and define @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath33 .",
    "first , we show that @xmath34 .",
    "suppose that we have a point @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath36 , we can add a constant to each @xmath37 such that the largest @xmath37 , without loss of generality @xmath38 , is equal to 0 .",
    "it is easy to lift the @xmath37 s to @xmath39 with @xmath40 such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 : lift every @xmath43 to @xmath44 , and lift @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "but then we claim that @xmath47 .",
    "this follows immediately : since there is no cancellation of the leading terms as all leading coefficients of the @xmath48 s and @xmath31 s are positive , for each coordinate @xmath49 we have @xmath50 as desired .    for the reverse direction , using the same logic ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath51 , again due to the lack of cancellation of leading terms , which shows that @xmath52 , completing the proof .",
    "we call the polytope @xmath53 a _ lift _ of @xmath54 . note that we can take any lifts of the vertices of the polytope , as long as the lifted points have positive leading coefficients ; the lift operation always preserves convex hulls . as an aside",
    ", the stipulation that each @xmath29 has first coordinate zero is merely for simplicity ; we could ignore this and just look at the facial structure of the cone generated by the lifts of the vertices .",
    "giving each @xmath29 first coordinate zero amounts to slicing this cone with the hyperplane @xmath55 .    in a sense , each one of these lifts yields a candidate for the face lattice of the tropical polytope @xmath54 .",
    "the problem is that when the points are not in ( tropically ) general position , the lifts can have different combinatorial structures .",
    "let @xmath56 $ ] be a @xmath57 matrix whose columns are considered as @xmath14 points in @xmath15 .",
    "the _ tropical determinant _ of @xmath58 is defined by the formula @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the group of permutations of @xmath14 elements .",
    "we say that @xmath58 is _ tropically non - singular _ if the maximum in its tropical determinant is attained uniquely . in this case , the _ tropical sign _ of @xmath58 is defined ( as in @xcite ) to be the sign of the permutation that attains the maximum .",
    "otherwise , the tropical sign is defined to be 0 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a @xmath57 matrix with entries in @xmath27 whose degree is @xmath58 . if the tropical sign of @xmath58 is not zero , then the sign of the unique permutation that attains the maximum in the tropical determinant is also the sign of the leading term of the determinant of @xmath61 .",
    "this observation leads to the following .",
    "[ orimat ] for a tropical polytope @xmath54 with at least @xmath14 vertices in @xmath15 , the oriented matroid structure of any lift @xmath53 must refine the partial oriented matroid structure of @xmath54 given by the tropical signs on each subset of the @xmath14 vertices .",
    "on the other hand , there may be a point configuration whose oriented matroid refines the partial oriented matriod of vertices of @xmath54 but can not be obtained as a lift .",
    "the oriented matroid of  the model \" that we will see in example [ model ] is the same as that of a square pyramid with two points at the cone point , but this point configuration can not be attained as a lift since distinct points must be lifted to distinct points .",
    "[ genpos ] if a tropical polytope @xmath54 with at least @xmath14 vertices in @xmath15 is in general position , then all lifts @xmath53 are simplicial and have the same oriented matroid structure .",
    "let @xmath8 be a matrix whose columns are vertices of @xmath54 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath54 is in general position ( in the sense of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4 ) ) implies that all maximal ( @xmath57 ) submatrices of @xmath8 are tropically non - singular . by the previous lemma",
    ", the tropical signs of these submatrices determine the chirotope of all the lifts @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , since these signs are all non - zero , the lifts are simplicial .",
    "it is still possible for lifts of a non - generic tropical polytope to be simplicial and have the same face lattice .",
    "for an example , see the tropical ( 2,4)-hypersimplex ( example [ octa ] ) .",
    "the geometric objects which form the relevant atoms of a theory of tropical faces are the images of faces of lifts under the degree map , which we call _ fatoms _ ( face atoms ) . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss different ways to combine these to form faces .",
    "a crucial step is the following , which provides the link between lifted hyperplanes and tropical hyperplanes .",
    "[ halfspacemap ] let @xmath62 be a hyperplane , and define @xmath63}. the image of @xmath64 under the degree map is a tropical hyperplane with apex @xmath65 , the image of @xmath66 consists of the union of the closed sectors indexed by @xmath67 , and the image of @xmath68 is the boundary of this tropical halfspace .",
    "( if some @xmath69 is equal to 0 , then the apex of this tropical hyperplane has @xmath17-th coordinate equal to infinity . )",
    "let @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 , then the leading term of @xmath72 has to cancel .",
    "the leading exponent of @xmath73 is @xmath74 , so the maximum of these @xmath14 expressions has to be achieved at least twice .",
    "this means that @xmath75 is in the indicated tropical hyperplane .",
    "conversely , if @xmath75 is in the tropical hyperplane , then @xmath76 has ties in the leading terms , and it is trivial to adjust leading coefficients and fill in subleading terms to find a lift of @xmath75 which lies on @xmath64 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath75 is not in any closed sector indexed by @xmath78 , then each @xmath69 for which the maximum of all @xmath74 is achieved has negative leading coefficient . since these are the terms which contribute to the leading term of @xmath72 , @xmath72 must be negative , a contradiction .",
    "conversely , if @xmath75 is in a closed sector indexed by , without loss of generality , @xmath79 , then @xmath74 is maximized by @xmath80",
    ". therefore @xmath81 contributes to the leading term of @xmath72 . finding",
    "a lift with sufficiently large leading coefficient of @xmath82 then ensures that @xmath83 .",
    "this completes the proof of the second assertion .",
    "the third statement can be proven the same way as the first , and by noting that the leading term of @xmath72 can cancel for @xmath84 if and only if @xmath85 lies in both the sectors @xmath67 and sectors @xmath86 .",
    "armed with this , we can prove a crucial step in this discussion , namely that the boundary of the lifted polytope indeed maps to the boundary of the tropical polytope .",
    "[ prop : bdry ]    let @xmath53 be a lift of the tropical polytope @xmath36 .",
    "then the image of the boundary of @xmath53 under the degree map is precisely the boundary of @xmath54 .",
    "every point in the boundary of @xmath53 lies in some facet .",
    "since the degree map preserves convex hulls , it must map to a point in the convex hull of the vertices of this facet .",
    "however , by proposition  [ halfspacemap ] , these vertices all lie in a tropical hyperplane which bounds @xmath54 ( namely the image of the hyperplane defining the facet of the lifted polytope ) , and since tropical hyperplanes are convex the image of our point in question must also lie on the boundary of @xmath54 .",
    "for the converse , suppose we have some point @xmath87 in the boundary of @xmath54 .",
    "this point is the image of some point in @xmath53 , since lifts preserve convex hulls ; however , a priori , this point need not lie on the boundary . consider a tropical hyperplane @xmath64 with apex @xmath87 .",
    "not every open sector of this hyperplane contains a point in @xmath54 , since that would imply that @xmath87 is in the interior of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we can partition the sectors of this hyperplane into a pair @xmath88 such that the @xmath58-sectors contain @xmath54 , with @xmath89 nonempty .",
    "suppose without loss of generality that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "define a linear functional @xmath92 on the lift space via @xmath93 where the @xmath37 s are positive real constants . since @xmath54 lies in the union of the @xmath58-sectors of @xmath64",
    ", every vertex @xmath94 of @xmath54 has @xmath95 maximized for some @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the leading term of the expression given by @xmath97 contains some positive summand from among the first @xmath98 terms of @xmath92 .",
    "so , if we make the @xmath37 s large enough , we can ensure that @xmath99 for all vertices @xmath100 of @xmath53 .",
    "fix a set of such @xmath37 s .",
    "but we can easily lift the point @xmath87 to a point @xmath101 with @xmath102 ; for instance , simply taking @xmath103 for @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath104 otherwise .",
    "hence @xmath87 has a lift which lies outside of @xmath53 .",
    "so , we have constructed a lift of @xmath87 which lies inside of @xmath53 , and a lift which lies outside of it .",
    "the line segment between these two lifts , each of which has positive leading coefficients , consists entirely of other lifts of @xmath87 , and must intersect the boundary of @xmath53 somewhere , completing the proof .",
    "the degree map is well - behaved ; for instance , it also does not increase the dimension of a face .",
    "if @xmath105 is a @xmath98-face of @xmath53 , then the image of @xmath105 under the degree map is at most @xmath98-dimensional .",
    "suppose we have a @xmath98-face @xmath105 of @xmath53 .",
    "triangulate this with its original vertex set , dividing it into a number of @xmath98-simplices which are the convex hulls of @xmath106 lifts of vertices of @xmath54 .",
    "the image of each such simplex under the degree map , by proposition  [ convlift ] , is the convex hull of @xmath106 points in @xmath15 , and is therefore at most @xmath98-dimensional ( see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "therefore , the image of @xmath105 under the degree map is the finite union of @xmath98-dimensional things , and is therefore @xmath98-dimensional .",
    "the fatoms where the dimension is preserved under this map are particularly crucial to our theory .",
    "a _ @xmath98-fatom _ of a tropical polytope @xmath54 is a @xmath98-dimensional piece of the boundary of @xmath54 which is the image of a @xmath98-dimensional face @xmath105 of some lift @xmath53 of @xmath54 .",
    "next , we discuss the dual formulation of a tropical polytope .",
    "tropical polytopes are typically considered as the convex hulls of point sets , and when expressed in this fashion they obtain a natural polyhedral decomposition as detailed in  @xcite .",
    "joswig  @xcite noted that each tropical polytope is the bounded intersection of a finite number of halfspaces , and that the apices of these halfspaces are drawn from an easily computable set ( the pseudovertices of the polytope , which are the vertices of the polyhedral decomposition of  @xcite . )",
    "our goal is to come up with a reasonably succinct list of tropical halfspaces whose intersection is @xmath54 .",
    "one natural attempt is to take a lift of the polytope , find the facet - defining halfspaces whose intersection is that lift , and then map the whole setup down to @xmath15 .",
    "this does not work in general ; the problem is that the intersection of the images of the halfspaces under the degree map can be larger than the degree of the intersections . in other words",
    ", there could be a point in @xmath15 which does not lift anywhere in @xmath53 , but which lifts to a ( different ) point inside each facet - defining halfspace of @xmath53 ; see example  [ ex : triangle ] for an example . however , this process does work for the interior of the polytope :    [ interior ] let @xmath36 be a full - dimensional tropical polytope .",
    "take a generic lift @xmath53 , and consider the images of its facet - defining halfspaces , which are tropical halfspaces in @xmath15 .",
    "then the intersection of the interiors of these tropical halfspaces is precisely the interior of @xmath54 .",
    "first , note that @xmath54 is contained in each tropical halfspace , as @xmath53 is contained in each of its facet - defining halfspaces .",
    "if we have a point in the interior of @xmath54 , there is a ball surrounding it which is entirely in @xmath54 .",
    "it therefore can not be on the boundary of any tropical halfspace .    for the reverse",
    "direction , suppose we have a point @xmath107 in the interior of each tropical halfspace . since the boundary of @xmath54 is contained in the union of the boundaries of the tropical halfspaces by proposition  [ prop : bdry ] , @xmath16 can not lie in the boundary of @xmath54 .",
    "so we need only to show @xmath108 .",
    "first , we claim that any lift of @xmath16 lies in each lifted halfspace .",
    "suppose without loss of generality that the halfspace in question consists of sectors @xmath109 of the hyperplane with apex @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath16 is in the interior of the tropical halfspace , the maximum of @xmath111 is achieved only in the first @xmath98 coefficients .",
    "the lifted halfspace has equation @xmath112 , where each @xmath69 has degree 0 .",
    "let us evaluate this on any lift @xmath113 of @xmath16 . since @xmath114 , the leading terms of these @xmath14 terms have degrees @xmath111 , and thus only the first @xmath98 terms have a chance of contributing to the leading term .",
    "furthermore , we know @xmath78 for @xmath96 $ ] , since the halfspace is to map to the union of the first @xmath98 sectors , and @xmath115 by the definition of a lift .",
    "therefore , the leading term of @xmath73 is positive for @xmath96 $ ] , and so the leading term of @xmath116 is positive ; therefore , @xmath113 is in this lifted halfspace .    therefore , any lift @xmath113 is in the interior of all facet - defining halfspaces of @xmath53 , and is therefore in ( the interior of ) @xmath53 .",
    "so @xmath117 , which completes the proof .",
    "if @xmath54 is pure , this process often results in an actual halfspace description of @xmath54 .",
    "[ purity ] suppose that the intersection of all tropical halfspaces in proposition  [ interior ] , which is a polyhedral complex , is pure .",
    "then it is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "the intersection contains @xmath54 , and their interiors are the same .",
    "since the intersection is pure , it is equal to the closure of its interior ; @xmath54 contains this closure , since it is closed , and so the two must be the same .",
    "indeed , we conjecture that this is true in general :    if @xmath54 is pure , then the halfspaces from a generic lift @xmath53 of @xmath54 map to tropical halfspaces whose intersection is @xmath54 itself . if , in addition , @xmath54 is generic , then any lift works .",
    "a tropical polytope @xmath54 is pure and full dimensional if and only if it has a halfspace description where the apices of these halfspaces are in general position with respect to the tropical semiring @xmath118 .    in ordinary polytope theory ,",
    "getting a halfspace description of a polytope is important for many reasons .",
    "perhaps foremost is that it provides a way for checking whether a point is in a polytope ; simply evaluate the relevant linear functionals on that point .",
    "however , in tropical geometry , it is easy to check whether a point is in a polytope from the vertex description :    @xcite let @xmath54 be the tropical convex hull of @xmath119 , and let @xmath16 be a point in @xmath15 .",
    "for each @xmath29 , define @xmath120 .",
    "then @xmath108 if and only if @xmath121 .",
    "because of this proposition , the halfspace description we search for is less crucial tropically than it is normally .",
    "however , it is still important ; for instance , it is easy to intersect two polytopes given by halfspace descriptions ( take the union of the sets of halfspaces in question . ) at press time there is no shortcut like the above proposition for intersecting tropical polytopes , so a halfspace description would allow us to accomplish this .",
    "another natural question to ask is the following :    how does one obtain a vertex description of a tropical polytope from its hyperplane description ?",
    "if the tropical polytope is pure , then lifting each tropical hyperplane to a hyperplane up above does the trick ; this will create some polytope @xmath53 in @xmath23 , and by proposition  [ purity ] its image in @xmath15 will be exactly equal to @xmath54 , and the vertices of @xmath54 will be drawn from among the degrees of the vertices of @xmath53 ( there may be some redundancy , especially if there is redundancy in the hyperplane description . )",
    "if the polytope is not pure , it is trickier .",
    "computing the extreme points of a tropically convex object is relatively simple geometrically  they are the points for which a closed sector of the hyperplane with that apex contains only @xmath54  but can these be computed directly from the hyperplane description ?",
    "in  @xcite , bayer and sturmfels defined the hull complex , a complex which yields a resolution of a monomial ideal @xmath122 . the construction is simple : lift each generator @xmath123 $ ] to a vector @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is some large number .",
    "form then a polyhedron @xmath126 by adding the positive orthant to the convex hull of these vectors . for @xmath125 sufficiently large , bayer and sturmfels showed that this polyhedron has constant combinatorial type , and that the complex of bounded faces of @xmath126 yields a cellular resolution of the monomial ideal .",
    "we give a brief review of the process which leads from a complex to a resolution .    given any polytopal complex @xmath54 with the vertices labeled by generators @xmath127 , we label each face by the least common multiple of the generators corresponding to its vertices .",
    "we then form a chain complex as follows : each face @xmath128 of the polytopal complex corresponds to a generator lying in homological degree equal to its dimension .",
    "this chain complex @xmath129 is to be graded , with the degree of @xmath128 equal to the label of @xmath128 ( which we denote @xmath130 ) ; each generator maps to the appropriately homogenized signed sum of the generators corresponding to its facets , i.e. @xmath131 where the sum runs over all facets @xmath132 of @xmath128 and the signs are chosen so that @xmath133 .    given any multidegree @xmath134 , the complex @xmath135 is defined to be the subcomplex of this chain complex given by taking the generators with @xmath130 dividing @xmath136 . the key result about cellular resolutions is the following :    @xcite[acyclic ] the chain complex @xmath129 is a free resolution ( called a * cellular resolution * ) of @xmath122 if and only if the subcomplex @xmath135 is acyclic for all @xmath137 .",
    "bayer and sturmfels go on to prove that the hull complex satisfies this condition .",
    "indeed , their proof works essentially verbatim if we lift each generator @xmath127 to any vector in @xmath23 which maps to @xmath138 under the degree map , i.e. a @xmath14-vector of elements in the puiseux series field with specified leading exponents .",
    "note that we can evaluate the facial structure of the resulting polyhedron in @xmath23 , without having to plug in a specific value for @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the tropical polytope given by the convex hull of the points @xmath139 , where @xmath140 ranges over the exponent vectors of the generators of a monomial ideal @xmath122 in @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "take any lift @xmath53 of @xmath54 and add the positive orthant in the last @xmath142 coordinates , @xmath143 , to @xmath53 to obtain a polyhedron @xmath144 .",
    "then the complex of bounded faces of @xmath144 yields a cellular resolution of @xmath122 .",
    "we need only to check that for each @xmath145 , the bounded faces of @xmath144 with labels dividing @xmath134 form an acyclic complex .",
    "let the coordinates of the space @xmath23 that @xmath144 lives in be given by @xmath146 , and consider the linear functional on @xmath23 given by @xmath147 . then on a given vertex of @xmath144",
    ", @xmath148 has positive leading exponent if and only if that generator does not divide @xmath136 .",
    "thus the bounded faces in the halfspace given by @xmath149 are precisely those in the subcomplex @xmath135 . applying a projective transformation sending this hyperplane to infinity yields @xmath135 as the complex of bounded faces of some polytope , which is acyclic .",
    "therefore , each @xmath135 is acyclic , and thus by proposition  [ acyclic ] this complex yields a cellular resolution of @xmath122 .",
    "these cellular resolutions can be smaller than the hull resolution .",
    "for instance , in a previous paper , the first author showed  @xcite that no face of the hull complex can have more than @xmath150 vertices ; this is not true for these cellular resolutions .",
    "for example , if we had seventeen million generators of a three - variable ideal all lying on the same tropical hyperplane , we could find a lift where these all lay on a single facet .",
    "these lifts include the hull complex as a special case , where each point is simply lifted to @xmath151 . like the hull complex ,",
    "each of them includes the _ scarf complex _ as a subcomplex ; this complex is a simplicial complex where a set of vertices forms a face if the corresponding set of generators has a unique least common multiple among all lcm s of sets of generators .",
    "[ lcm ] suppose that a set @xmath152 of the generators of @xmath122 has a unique least common multiple .",
    "then @xmath152 forms a ( simplicial ) bounded face in every @xmath144 .",
    "the proof is by induction .",
    "we claim that for every @xmath153 , @xmath154 has a unique least common multiple .",
    "suppose it did not ; let @xmath155 be another set with the same least common multiple .",
    "then @xmath156 has the same least common multiple as @xmath157 , so since @xmath152 has a unique least common multiple , we must have @xmath158 .",
    "the only other set for which this is true is @xmath159 , but this contradicts the statement that @xmath152 has a unique lcm .    therefore , by induction on the dimension , every proper subset of @xmath152 forms a face .",
    "let the least common multiple of @xmath152 be @xmath136 , and as before consider the linear functional given by @xmath160 .",
    "no generator not in @xmath152 divides @xmath136 ( otherwise adding it to @xmath152 gives the same lcm ) , and so the hyperplane @xmath161 separates the vertices in @xmath152 from the vertices outside of @xmath152 . again applying a projective transformation to map this hyperplane to infinity ,",
    "the induced subcomplex of bounded faces on @xmath152 must be acyclic .",
    "since it contains every proper subset of @xmath152 as a face , it must also contain @xmath152 itself .",
    "so @xmath152 is a bounded face of @xmath144 as desired .",
    "the following result follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.26 ) and propositions [ genpos ] and [ lcm ] .",

    ". it would be interesting to answer the following questions :    what does the family of lifts of a given tropical polytope look like ? are there generalized hull resolutions we can only get by lifting to nonconvergent power series",

    "in order to find a good notion of _ faces _ of tropical polytopes , let us enumerate some desirable properties :    * the faces should be extreme sets , in the sense that there should not be two points in the polytope not in a face such that the tropical line segment connecting them intersects the face .",

    "the intersection of two faces should be a face of both , or at least a union of faces of both .      while  @xcite gave a canonical decomposition of a tropical polytope as an ordinary polytopal complex dual to a subdivision of a product of two simplices , this decomposition was larger than desired by michael joswig .",
    "for instance , according to this decomposition , the convex hull of three points in two - space could have as many as six edges . in  @xcite , joswig therefore proposed the following definition of a facet of a tropical polytope , to which we ascribe his initial .",
    "a _ j - facet _ of a tropical polytope @xmath54 is the convex hull of a maximal set of vertices of @xmath54 contained in a closed halfspace containing @xmath54 .",

    "joswig s definition looks at the maximal fatoms , and defines these to be the facets ; it then assumes that , as in ordinary geometry , it makes sense to recover the vertex sets of faces by combinatorially intersecting the vertex sets of facets .",
    "this definition works well for two - dimensional tropical polytopes ; the polytope formed by the convex hull of @xmath163 points in convex position will have face lattice identical to that of an @xmath163-gon .",

    "although the j - faces are themselves tropical polytopes , they do not have any of the properties listed above .",
    "moreover , a j - facet may not be the intersection of the halfspace defining it with the polytope itself , and the intersection of the facet - defining halfspaces is not necessarily equal to the polytope itself . in this section ,",
    "we present examples exhibiting several issues with this definition .",
    "our first example is in @xmath164 , where joswig s theory is plainly correct ; it highlights a difference between ordinary polytopes and tropical polytopes .",

    "_ discussion : _ this polytope is a tropical triangle in the plane , whose vertices are the solid circles in figure  [ triangle ] .",
    "it evidently has three facets , and three facet - defining halfspaces , one for each edge .",
    "these facet - defining halfspaces have apexes given by the dotted circles , which are ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) , ( 0 , 3 , 3 ) , and ( 0 , 3 , 1 ) ; the halfspace at ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) is given by sector 2 , the one at ( 0 , 3 , 3 ) by sector 1 , and the one at ( 0 , 3 , 1 ) by sectors 2 and 3 .",
    "however , the intersection of these three facet - defining halfspaces is bigger than the polytope ; it also contains a ray starting at ( 0 , 3 , 0 ) and emanating downwards .",
    "as stated in  @xcite , every tropical polytope is in fact the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces ; to obtain @xmath54 , we need to add a fourth half - space .",
    "one with apex @xmath166 would work .",

    "the problem here is not one of genericity ; moving the point @xmath166 infinitesimally results in a combinatorially identical tropical polytope .",
    "rather , this is just a way in which tropical polytopes are different from ordinary polytopes .",
    "note also that the two facets involving ( 0 , 3 , 0 ) intersect in a line segment , not a point .",
    "one way of expressing this is that each j - facet is defined by a tropical hyperplane which splits space into two parts , each a union of sectors of the hyperplane ; @xmath54 is contained in one of these parts , and the j - facet in question is contained in the boundary between the two parts . in this case",
    ", the facet connecting @xmath166 and @xmath167 contains the extra data that sector 1 contains @xmath54 , and that this facet is contained in the boundary between sector 1 and the union of sectors 2 and 3 .",
    "this extra data can also be computed by finding a lift where the j - facet lifts to a facet and using proposition  [ halfspacemap ] .    using this extra data ,",
    "the two facets ought to intersect in the single point ( 0 , 3 , 0 ) ; in essence , they are on different sides of the rest of the line segment ( see section  [ direction ] for more discussion . ) joswig gets around this by stating that the intersection of two facets is defined to be the convex hull of the intersection of their vertex sets ; as we will see later , though , this definition has major problems",

    "its natural polyhedral decomposition  @xcite consists of three three - dimensional cells , all unit cubes , and a number of two - dimensional flaps .",
    "this polytope exhibits a number of the problems mentioned earlier in this section .",
    "the vertex sets of the j - facets as defined by joswig are abdc ( hyperplane with apex 0235 ) , abed ( 0244 ) , abfe ( 0253 ) , abfc ( 0255 ) , and cdef ( 0155 ) .",
    "consider the facet with vertices abed .",
    "this comprises the center third of the upper flap , as well as two boundary squares connecting the apex 0244 with the vertices 0134 and 0143 .",
    "this facet is not the intersection of the polytope with its facet - defining hyperplane , which includes some more of the upper flap ; taking two points on opposite sides of abed yields two points not in the facet for which the tropical line segment containing them intersects the facet .",
    "see figure  [ modelbad ] .",
    "the fundamental problem here is that in some lifts , abed itself is not a facet of the lift . in those lifts ,",
    "we can take two points not in the lift of abed for which the tropical line segment connecting them ( these could be the lifts of 0242 and 0224 , for instance ) pierces the convex hull of abed .",
    "investigating these facets further , we find that the facets abdc , abed , abfe , and abfc intersect pathologically .",
    "to be precise , their intersections are two - dimensional ; the convex hulls of abdc and abed intersect in the convex hull of abd , a two - dimensional object .",
    "the intersection of abed and abfc is the `` top flap '' portion of abed , which is not the convex hull of the intersection of their vertex sets ( ab ) ; indeed , this is not a j - face at all according to definition .",
    "this last problem again is unavoidable , and can be explained by the fact that these facets lie in different directions , and thus do not morally intersect two - dimensionally .",
    "but the problem with abdc and abed , which are faces lying in the same direction , is not of this flavor .",
    "simply put , two - dimensional faces should not intersect two - dimensionally . looking at abdc , its edges are clearly given by ab , bd , dc , and ca ; any reasonable person would call it a square .",
    "yet abed s edges are clearly ab , be , ed , and da , meaning that ad is also an edge ; this is clearly contrary to examination of the square abdc .",
    "furthermore , according to joswig s definition , a and b are not actually vertices of this polytope .",
    "if we intersect the facet vertex sets setwise , we never get the singletons a and b , but merely the atom ab . so according to joswig s definition , this object is a pyramid over a square , with vertices ab ( apex ) , c , d , e , and f. but this misses some aspects of the tropical polytope , as a and b are both vertices in the sense that if we remove either , the convex hull changes .",
    "it is merely the weirdness of the tropical structure which ensures that there is no facet - defining hyperplane which contains one of them but not the other .",
    "however , there certainly exist hyperplanes which contain @xmath54 in a half - space and intersect it only in , for instance , vertex a. in every way other than joswig s definition , a appears to be a vertex ; indeed , it is a vertex of every lift . it should be a vertex of @xmath54 .",
    "it is worth noting that in ordinary geometry , we can obtain a hyperplane which defines a face @xmath171 by finding hyperplanes which define @xmath128 and @xmath172 and adding their linear functionals .",
    "this operation does not work in tropical geometry , where a ) the directions of @xmath128 and @xmath172 may be different , and b ) there is no reasonable way to take linear combinations of hyperplanes .    in this example , the j - face lattice is actually reasonable ; it is graded , with height equal to the dimension of the polytope , namely 3 .",
    "indeed , as previously mentioned , it is the face lattice of an egyptian pyramid .",
    "however , this is easily breakable by expanding the example .",
    "let @xmath54 be the tropical convex hull of @xmath173    -1 in    -1 in    _ discussion : _ this polytope ( figure  [ 3model ] ) is merely a three - tiered version of the two - tiered previous example .",
    "the j - facets are abfi , abdc , abed , cdegf , cdehg , and cdeih . by joswig s definition ,",
    "taking setwise intersections of these j - facets , we have a chain of faces given by @xmath174 .",
    "this chain is too long to live in the boundary of a 3-polytope .",
    "the problem geometrically , of course , is that cdeg and cdegf are both two - dimensional ; by adding the third tier , we merely ensured that d would actually be a vertex by joswig s definition .",
    "one possible solution would be to treat the facets as maximal elements of a cell complex , evaluating their faces by looking at the facets and taking the collection of all of their faces as the cells ( for instance , the faces of abdc are ab , bd , dc , and ca ) . under this definition ,",
    "the j - facets abdc and abed would not intersect in the triangle abd , but rather in the union of the edge ab and the vertex d. this breaks the condition that two faces should intersect in a single face , but restores the grading to the face lattice in a rather crude way .",
    "however , even if we do this , the homology of the face lattice ( which was not even definable if the lattice was nt graded ) will not be that of an appropriately dimensioned sphere ; for instance , in the model , the homology turns out to be @xmath175 in dimension 1 and 0 in all other dimensions .",
    "as outlined in the previous section , joswig s definition has several undesirable properties . in this section",
    ", we introduce a new definition which deals with these problems .",
    "a _ @xmath98-face _",
    "@xmath128 of @xmath54 is a minimal subset of the boundary of @xmath54 such that for any lift of @xmath54 , @xmath128 is always the union of @xmath98-fatoms emanating from this lift , i.e. the union of images of @xmath98-faces of the lift under the degree map .",
    "if @xmath54 is in general position , by proposition [ genpos ] , the face lattice of @xmath54 is the same as that of any lift . in this case , the face lattice is determined by combinatorially intersecting the vertex sets of facets , and this new definition is the same as that of joswig s .",
    "in essence , this definition gets rid of many of the problems with joswig s definition in the non - generic case via the following method : whenever two j - facets fundamentally intersect improperly , they are declared to be part of the same facet of @xmath54 .",
    "note also that it is clear that the 0-faces of @xmath54 are always precisely the vertices .",
    "it is illuminating to re - investigate the model ; recall that this is the convex hull of the points @xmath176 . by this definition ,",
    "the model @xmath54 has three facets ; the upper shell comprising the convex hull of @xmath177 , the lower face comprising the convex hull of @xmath178 , and the `` underbelly '' given by the union of the convex hulls of @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "the problematic pairs of faces which intersect improperly , such as @xmath182 , have all been combined into the underbelly .",
    "this underbelly is a facet because in every lift , it is the union of facets of the lifted polytope .",
    "for instance , it could be the union of the faces @xmath183 , or @xmath184 , or @xmath185 , or numerous other possibilities depending on the lift .",
    "however , in every lift , it is the union of images of facets .",
    "furthermore , it is minimal with this property ; for instance , the j - facet abde is not the union of facets in some lifts , such as @xmath183 .",
    "this is because it overlaps other j - facets in an essential manner .",
    "our new definition also handles inessential overlaps elegantly .",
    "consider the underbelly and the upper shell .",
    "setwise , these intersect in an awkward two - dimensional region , but this overlap does not cause them to be united into the same face , as in all lifts abcf is partitioned and the underbelly is partitioned , independently . this is because the surface abcf always partitions the top portion of the lift into facets with different directions .    for any lift @xmath53 of @xmath54 , the facets of @xmath54 partition the boundary of @xmath53 in a natural way ;",
    "every face of @xmath53 has an image under the degree map which is contained in a face of @xmath54 .",
    "this opens the door for an improved definition of the intersection of two faces of @xmath54 ; in particular , it would be nice if the underbelly and the upper shell in the union of the edges ca , ab , and bf rather than in the awkward two - dimensional region whichis their setwise intersection .",
    "the following does the trick .",
    "let @xmath54 be a tropical polytope , and let @xmath128 and @xmath172 be faces . then the intersection of @xmath128 and @xmath172 is defined as follows : take any lift @xmath53 of @xmath54 , and consider the lifts @xmath105 and @xmath186 , i.e. the unions of all faces of the same dimension which map into @xmath128 .",
    "the _ intersection _ of @xmath128 and @xmath172 is the image under the degree map of the intersection of these two lifts .    to see this in action ,",
    "consider the various lifts of the model shown in figure  [ lifts ] . in each of these lifts ,",
    "the three facets are each a union of various faces of the lifts .",
    "their intersections , however , are always the same , each a union of edges .",
    "note that each edge contained in one of these intersections is an edge in each lift .    in practice",
    ", this definition seems to yield extremely sensible results .",
    "the complete results for the model show three 2-faces , seven 1-faces ( ab , ac , cd , de , ef , cf , bf ) , and six 0-faces ( the vertices ) ; see figure  [ model - facelat ] .",
    "this , along with many other examples and intuition , lead us to formulate the following conjectures about our new definition , each of which represents an improvement on joswig s .",
    "[ conjlist ]    1 .",
    "@xmath98-faces of tropical polytopes are extreme sets .",
    "the ( topological ) boundary of a @xmath98-face is a union of @xmath187-faces .",
    "thus , the faces fit together to form a cell complex .",
    "[ spherical ] the homology of this cell complex is that of a sphere .",
    "the intersection of two faces is well - defined ( i.e. does not depend on the lift ) , and is itself a contractible union of faces .",
    "note that in some cases , a ( for instance ) 3-face in a lift which maps to a two - dimensional object under the degree map may be part of the lifts of two 3-faces of @xmath54 . in this case , though , its contribution to the intersection will still be two - dimensional .",
    "@xmath98-faces of tropical polytopes are always contractible .",
    "the faces of a tropical polytope do not depend on the provided vertex set .",
    "in other words , if we consider @xmath54 as the convex hull of a different set of points ( and form lifts by lifting this different set of points ) , the @xmath98-faces of @xmath54 will be the same for all @xmath98 .",
    "conjecture [ conjlist]([spherical ] ) essentially states that the boundary of a tropical polytope can be partitioned into a natural cell complex , which triangulates this spherical boundary . of course ,",
    "since a tropical polytope need not be pure , its boundary need not be homeomorphic to a sphere .",
    "however , there is some natural sense in which we can modify a tropical polytope to obtain a ball : pumping some air into its interior will `` inflate '' the lower - dimensional parts of the boundary .",
    "the intersection rule given in the previous section will ensure that faces which are morally on opposite sides of these lower - dimensional parts will intersect properly , i.e. as they would upon inflation .",
    "another natural sense in which the boundary is a sphere is given by lifting the polytope .",
    "any lift @xmath53 of a tropical polytope @xmath54 is of course an ordinary polytope , homeomorphic to a ball , and thus the boundary @xmath188 is homeomorphic to a sphere .",
    "this boundary is subdivided by the boundary complex of @xmath53 , and maps to the boundary of @xmath54 ; in this fashion , each lift of @xmath54 provides a subdivision of the boundary of @xmath54 . again , different faces ( even from the same lift ) can map to parts of @xmath54 which overlap setwise , but do not do so morally ( upon inflation . )",
    "consider for instance the model ; the 2-fatoms abcf and abde appear to intersect in a two - dimensional region .",
    "this should not be the case , and the reason is that abde covers the bottom side of this region , while abcf covers the top side . meanwhile , abcd and abde do intersect in a two - dimensional region , as both lie on the bottom side of this flap .    in this case , it is easy to define this concept of _ direction_. abcf is cut out by a hyperplane with apex 0255 , and the polytope lies in sector 1 of this hyperplane , with the face lying in the boundary between 1 and @xmath189 .",
    "so the 2-face has direction given by @xmath190 .",
    "similarly , abde is cut out by a hyperplane with apex 0244 ; the polytope lies in the sectors indexed by 2 , 3 , and 4 , and the face lies in the boundary between the union of these sectors and sector 1 .",
    "so abde has direction given by @xmath191 .",
    "abcd similarly has direction @xmath191 , so abde and abcd fundamentally overlap , while the overlap between either and abcf is illusory .",
    "these directions also correspond to equations of hyperplanes @xmath192 defining the faces of the lift which make these 2-fatoms , via proposition  [ halfspacemap ] . the first set in the direction is given by those @xmath17 for which @xmath78 in all lifts , while the second set is given by those @xmath17 for which @xmath193 in all lifts .",
    "otherwise @xmath17 is in neither set .",
    "this happens in the following example :    let @xmath54 be the convex hull of @xmath194 .",
    "_ discussion : _ in this example , vertical edge ab has direction given by @xmath195 , while edge ac has direction @xmath196 and edge bc has direction @xmath197 .",
    "note that as before , ac and bc are on opposite sides of their setwise one - dimensional overlap .    in all of these situations thus far , it is clear what the direction would be .",
    "this concept is an intuitive notion as to when @xmath98-fatoms intersect improperly , and when they merely appear to intersect improperly .",
    "however , there are potential problems .",
    "if @xmath98 is fairly small , different lifts may have different minimal direction sets @xmath198  for instance , a fatom in some large - dimensional polytope could conceivably lie in the boundary between sectors 1 and 2 , but also in the boundary between sectors 1 and 3 , with the polytope lying in 1 .",
    "it makes no sense for the direction here to be @xmath199 .",
    "another important question in direction theory is to figure out how to compute the intersections of faces with different directions .",
    "for instance , abcf and abde in the model have complementary directions ; how do we use this information to determine that they intersect in edge ab ?    indeed , determining the direction of edge ab , and of lower - dimensional faces in general , is a tricky one . even fixing the lift",
    ", there are many different face - defining functionals .",
    "for instance , consider the _ hull lift _ of the model , where we lift the point abcd to @xmath200 .",
    "this lift has as two of its facets abcf and abde , which are defined by the following linear functionals ( the notation ( 65 - 21 ) represents the coefficient @xmath201 , and so on ) :    @xmath202    so far , so good ; the directions indicated by the sign vectors of the coefficients agree with the sectors of the corresponding tropical hyperplane which the polytope is contained in , and this is true of any lift where these are faces .",
    "however , we can find a linear functional cutting out the lifted edge ab by taking any positive linear combination of these two functionals ; this produces many possible sign vectors .",
    "the set which can be obtained from this lift alone is @xmath203 , and others such as @xmath204 can be obtained from different lifts .",
    "what is the true direction of this edge ?    some of these hyperplanes  namely the set @xmath205  map to tropical hyperplanes whose intersection with the model polytope @xmath54 is not just the edge ab . indeed , if we perturb the facet - defining functionals of abde and abcf infinitesimally , they will map to the same tropical hyperplanes , but their intersection with the lifted polytope will decrease in dimension . similarly ,",
    "the hyperplane @xmath206 maps to the degenerate tropical hyperplane with apex at @xmath207 ; this is just the hyperplane @xmath208 , whose intersection with @xmath54 is two - dimensional ( although it intersects the vertex set of @xmath54 in only the vertices @xmath58 and @xmath89 . )    the sign vectors @xmath209 and @xmath210 are the ones which most embody the platonic ideal of a direction for ab .",
    "the apex of the tropical hyperplane which defines ab should , morally speaking , be the point @xmath211 .",
    "if we place a tropical hyperplane there , it intersects @xmath54 precisely in the edge ab .",
    "furthermore , the rest of @xmath54 is contained in ( the union of ) sectors 3 and 4 .",
    "meanwhile , the edge ab lies entirely in the intersection between sector 1 and the union of sectors 3 and 4 , but also lies entirely in the intersection between sector 2 and the union of sectors 3 and 4 .",
    "therefore , from considering this hyperplane , both @xmath212 and @xmath213 are reasonable candidates for the direction of ab . by translating this hyperplane in the positive-1 or positive-2 directions ,",
    "we can easily obtain tropical hyperplanes which propose either of these as the unique direction of ab .",
    "is there always a natural apex for a ( tropical ) hyperplane defining a @xmath98-fatom of a tropical polytope @xmath54 ?    if there were , we could use these to determine ( more or less ) directions , and use these directions to determine many things , among them which fatoms should be part of the same face ( an alternate definition which should be equivalent to the one presented here , made without having to consider all lifts of the polytope ) , and what the intersection of two faces should be ( i.e. their moral intersection , as opposed to their setwise intersection . ) the study of tropical polytopes via directions deserves more investigation ; note that such a thing is possible in tropical geometry because the set of edge directions of tropical polytopes viewed as ordinary polyhedral complexes is restricted to the set of 0/1-vectors ( with a similar statement about higher - dimensional faces . )",
    "in this section , we present two more examples of tropical polytopes .",
    "let @xmath54 be the convex hull of @xmath214 , as depicted in figure  [ cubependant ] .",

    "the connection between tropical chirotopes and oriented matroids of lifted point configurations as seen in lemma [ orimat ] and proposition [ genpos ] can help with this problem .",
    "the various parts of conjecture  [ conjlist ] all seem to be true based on experimental evidence in three dimensions",
    ". proving these nice properties would certainly be an important step in understanding tropical polytopes .",
    "what do @xmath98-faces of tropical polytopes look like ?",
    "unlike ordinary polytopes , these need not be isomorphic ( as tropical objects ) to polytopes in tropical projective @xmath98-space .",
    "are they combinatorially isomorphic ?",
    "the octahedron ( example  [ octa ] ) is an example of a tropical regular polytope , one where the face lattice is ( combinatorially ) transitive on the complete flags of faces .",
    "can we classify these in general ?",
    "are there any other than simplices , the octahedron in dimension three , and polygons ?",
    "how does this formulation interact with the hyperplane description of @xmath54 ?",
    "this provides a natural decomposition of @xmath54 as a polytopal complex ; can we use the polytopes here ( the types of  @xcite ) to find the faces of @xmath54 ?",
    "joswig  @xcite showed that the 0-faces of this polytopal complex include all the apices of hyperplanes that are needed to cut out @xmath54 .",
