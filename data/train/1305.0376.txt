    "despite numerous efforts conducted in the past , the understanding of macroscopic systems out of equilibrium is still far from being put in a systematic theory . unlike the relaxation around the equilibrium which has become a standard textbook material , less",
    "can be said for systems that are maintained far from equilibrium .",
    "one possible route to fill this gap that proved useful in the past ( e.g. in developing general theory of critical phenomena ) is to study particular microscopic models .",
    "usually , one starts with a minimal model that admits analytical treatment ( exact or approximate ) , later adding more details to make it more realistic .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of detailed balance - a defining property of systems maintained far from equilibrium - means that we are generally deprived even of the knowledge of its steady state , not to mention the relaxation mechanism towards it . exactly solved models far from equilibrium are thus rare , but have an important role in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "one such model is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , a minimal model of transport of ( classical ) particles driven by an external field and interacting only through the exclusion principle that prevents them from coming too close to each other .",
    "although simplified , this interaction describes several real situations on various length scales , ranging from mobile ions in superionic conductors @xcite to self - propelled particles in mesoscopic ( ribosomes on a mrna @xcite ) and macroscopic ( cars @xcite ) systems . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the asep has become a paradigmatic model of boundary - induced phase transitions that are , unlike their equilibrium counterpart ( with short - range interactions ) , present even in one dimension .",
    "originally proposed to model translation of mrna more than five decades ago @xcite , the exact solution in 1993 @xcite sparked a great interest that led to several important results relevant to the general theory of nonequilibrium steady states . using the exact solution of the asep , derrida ,",
    "lebowitz and speer @xcite derived a non - equilibrium analogue of the free energy that describes coarse - grained fluctuations around the steady state , thus generalizing older onsager - machlup theory @xcite valid around equilibrium .",
    "this later helped bertini @xcite to build the macroscopic theory of fluctuations for driven diffusive systems , of which the asep is just one example .",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to improve the asep to better fit particular phenomena , most of which have their origins in vehicular traffic or biology ( for a comprehensive and recent review see @xcite ) . the exact solution has been successfully extended to particle - dependent hopping rates @xcite and multispecies systems @xcite , both of importance for traffic phenomena . in biology ,",
    "some of the generalizations include particles occupying more than one site @xcite , position - dependent hopping rates ( termed site - wise disorder ) @xcite , desorption and adsorption of particles in the bulk ( i.e. langmuir kinetics ) @xcite , particles with internal states @xcite , extension to more than one lane @xcite , dynamically extending lattice @xcite , etc .",
    "unfortunately , common to most of these generalizations is non - applicability of the exact methods that were used to solve the original asep , namely the matrix - product ansatz ( see e.g. @xcite ) . instead",
    ", most approaches utilize various mean - field approximations that neglect correlations in a fashion similar to truncation in the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy .",
    "while they give a satisfactory account for most of the aforementioned phenomena , it is less clear how to improve them in some controlled fashion . in some cases such as site - wise disorder , the mean - field approximation itself becomes hard to treat analytically as the number of inhomogeneities increases .",
    "in this article we study totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) - a version of the asep with unidirectional hopping - in the presence of site - wise disorder and show that some of the information about its exact steady state can still be retained .",
    "our starting point is the known fact , reviewed in [ appendix_a ] , that the non - normalized steady - state weights which solve the master equation can always be written as multivariate polynomials in all the hopping rates or alternatively , as univariate polynomials in one of the hopping rates with polynomial coefficients that depend on all other hopping rates @xcite .",
    "as our main result , we show how to compute the first few lowest polynomial coefficients exactly , which gives a good approximation of the exact steady - state weights if the hopping rate that we expand in is much smaller than the other rates .",
    "since in that case the particle current is small , we term this regime the low - current regime .",
    "our method of computing non - normalized steady - state weights in the low - current regime is not restricted to site - wise disorder but can be readily applied to many other generalizations of the tasep and other driven diffusive system with unidirectional hopping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we define the tasep with site - dependent hopping rates and review some of the related exact results . a general approach for calculating steady state in the low - current regime",
    "is devised in section [ general ] for arbitrary disorder distributions .",
    "section [ examples ] is devoted to few particular cases of binary disorder where all the slow sites share the same hopping rate @xmath0 .",
    "our main interest there is to calculate steady - state average of the particle current , i.e. its taylor expansion in one of the hopping rates which is considered to be small .",
    "some of the exact results that we obtain have already been known , but here they are derived for the first time rather then being guessed from the exact solution of small systems @xcite .",
    "further applications , mainly devoted to the most general case of non - binary disorder , are discussed in [ further_applications ] with some interesting new implications for the protein synthesis .",
    "we consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) on an one - dimensional lattice of @xmath2 sites , where each site @xmath3 is either occupied by a particle ( @xmath4 ) or empty ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "particles each move forward stochastically at rate @xmath6 ( which is modelled by the random - sequential update ) , provided the site @xmath7 in front is empty ( exclusion principle ) . in this paper",
    "we consider mainly binary disorder @xcite , which means that @xmath6 is either @xmath0 ( slow sites ) or @xmath8 ( regular sites ) .",
    "( non - binary disorder with @xmath9 to which our approach applies as well is left for section [ further_applications ] . )",
    "boundary conditions can be either periodic ( @xmath10 ) or open , the latter meaning that new particles are injected at site site @xmath11 at rate @xmath12 provided it is empty , and are removed from the site @xmath13 at rate @xmath14 .",
    "an illustration of the process ( not drawing boundary rules explicitly ) is presented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "are represented by ( permeable ) walls to emphasize that letting @xmath15 means no particle is allowed to move through the wall.,width=151 ]    the steady state is described completely by the probability @xmath16 to find the system in a given configuration @xmath17 , which solves the following continuous - time master equation , written here in a compact form ,    @xmath18    in [ appendix_a ] we show that the steady - state probability @xmath16 is proportional to the determinant of a matrix whose matrix elements are linear combinations of hopping rates .",
    "that allows us to write @xmath16 in the following form ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a _ multivariate polynomial _ in all hopping rates ,    @xmath21    the particular form of ( [ p ] ) with @xmath20 given by ( [ poly_periodic ] ) or ( [ poly_open ] ) means that the ensemble average of any physical observable @xmath22 ( e.g. local density @xmath23 at site @xmath24 , or current @xmath25 ) is a rational function with respect to any of the hopping rates ( say @xmath1 )    @xmath26    where coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given by    @xmath29    by expanding ( [ rational ] ) in taylor series around @xmath15 we arrive at    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    here",
    "@xmath32 is the maximal degree of all @xmath20 s as polynomials in @xmath1 , and can be calculated by invoking schnakenberg s network theory @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is not important in our approach , as calculating coefficients beyond first few terms in ( [ expansion_g ] ) becomes extremely difficult .",
    "the idea of expanding @xmath33 in small @xmath1 originates from the work of janowsky and lebowitz @xcite .",
    "they obtained the first few coefficients in the expansion of current @xmath34 around @xmath15 in the tasep with a single slow site both in the periodic and in the open boundaries case with @xmath35    @xmath36    the expansion ( [ j_1 ] ) was obtained by solving the full master equation for small systems with @xmath37 and noticing that as @xmath2 increases , low - order terms become independent of @xmath2 .",
    "a similar approach , coined _ finite segment mean - field theory _ ( fsmft ) , has been devised by chou and lakatos in @xcite for the open boundaries case with few slow sites . when slow sites are confined to a small segment ,",
    "the idea is to solve the master equation exactly for that small segment and then calculate the current @xmath38 as a function of the average densities @xmath39 and @xmath40 at its ends .",
    "assuming that the density profiles are flat outside the segment , @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be then calculated numerically by solving @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , chou and lakatos were able to deduce the analytical expression for the current up to @xmath43 for two particular configurations of disorder , namely    @xmath44    for two slow sites placed @xmath45 sites apart , and    @xmath46    for a bottleneck of @xmath47 slow sites . as @xmath48 in ( [ j_2 ] ) , the current for @xmath49 approaches @xmath50 as in the tasep with one slow site . in ( [ j_bottle ] ) ,",
    "the current is clearly dominated by the capacity of the bottleneck and approaches @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",
    "the downside of fsmft is that the present computing power restricts the size of the segment that is treated exactly to @xmath53 sites , thus excluding more complex disorder configurations . also , fsmft is basically a brute force attack on the master equation and tells us little about where the coefficients e.g. in ( [ j_1])-([j_bottle ] ) come from . in the next section",
    "we will present a general approach for computing low - order terms in the expansion @xmath54 , where @xmath55 stands for any of the model s hopping rates such that the current @xmath56 as @xmath57 ( @xmath58 in the periodic boundaries case or @xmath59 in the open boundaries case ) .",
    "we start by writing @xmath20 as a polynomial in one of the model s hopping rates @xmath55 ,    @xmath60    where we assume @xmath61 to be dependent on @xmath62 and all other hopping rates @xmath63 .",
    "inserting ( [ gamma ] ) in the stationary master equation ( [ master_periodic ] ) or ( [ master_open ] ) and collecting all the terms of @xmath64 gives recursion relations    @xmath65    @xmath66    it is useful to picture our system as a directed graph made of vertices ( configurations ) and directed edges ( transitions between configurations ) weighted by the hopping rates .",
    "edges that are weighted by @xmath55 are called slow , and all the others are called regular . a special role here",
    "is played by configurations that have all their outgoing edges slow .",
    "we will call such configurations _ blocked _ ( with respect to @xmath55 ) because if the system gets into one of these configurations and @xmath67 , it will stay there forever .",
    "if @xmath68 is a non - empty set of all such configurations then terms @xmath69 are clearly absent from ( [ master_f0 ] ) for any @xmath70 .",
    "for example , the tasep with a slow site and periodic boundary conditions has only one blocked configuration with respect to @xmath1 , the one in which all particles are behind the slow site . in the open boundaries case",
    "there are two additional blocked configurations , one with respect to @xmath12 ( an empty lattice ) and one with respect to @xmath14 ( full lattice ) .",
    "the fact that some terms are missing when collecting zeroth - order terms may seem confusing , because we have to go to the next order in @xmath55 to calculate @xmath69 , but we need @xmath69 to calculate the next order terms . in the next section",
    "we show how to eliminate all first - order terms , thus ending up with a closed set equations for @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "we start by outlining the general procedure for calculating zeroth - order terms and then show how it works on an explicit example . since @xmath69 is absent from ( [ master_f0 ] ) for any @xmath70",
    ", we can assume that @xmath71 for @xmath70 and then solve ( [ master_f0 ] ) by setting all the remaining zeroth - order terms to @xmath72 ,    @xmath73    thus the existence of blocked configurations reduces the calculation of @xmath69 to a smaller set of configurations @xmath68 .    to get a closed set of equations for the remaining zeroth - order terms we have to inspect terms that are linear in @xmath55 ,    @xmath74    it will prove useful to write ( [ master_f1 ] ) in the following form ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is some unknown matrix . inserting ( [ recursion_1 ] ) in ( [ master_f1 ] ) ,",
    "the equation for @xmath69 now reads    @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given by    @xmath80    @xmath81    to find @xmath69 , we have to find @xmath76 , calculate @xmath82 and then solve ( [ system_f0 ] ) .",
    "luckily , @xmath82 can be found without using the expression ( [ kappa ] ) .",
    "the algorithm that we give below is essentially the same as the one we ll use later for constructing @xmath76 .    to start with ,",
    "let s call a path @xmath83 in configuration space any sequence of configurations @xmath84 such that none of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 are zero .",
    "a regular path is a path in which none of the edges is slow .",
    "with all these preliminaries , we rewrite the equation ( [ master_f1 ] ) for @xmath69 , @xmath70 ,    @xmath89    configurations @xmath90 on the r.h.s .",
    "are obtained by moving one of the particles _ backwards_. any move to a configuration @xmath91 across a slow edge should be discarded since @xmath92 for @xmath91 and the second term on the r.h.s .",
    "vanishes in that case .",
    "now let s focus on @xmath90 for which @xmath93 . since we started from @xmath70 and moved one particle backwards across a regular edge , @xmath90 has the following properties : ( a ) @xmath91 , ( b ) @xmath92 and ( c ) @xmath94 .",
    "the last one is simply because @xmath90 is just one jump from @xmath62 and therefore can not have any other regular outgoing edges except the one pointing towards @xmath62 .",

    ". of ( [ master_f1b ] ) is exactly what we get on the r.h.s . of ( [ master_f1a ] ) by moving one particle across a regular edge from @xmath70",
    ". we can then insert ( [ master_f1b ] ) in ( [ master_f1a ] ) and thus eliminate @xmath95 . the idea is to repeat this process of moving particles backwards and substituting @xmath97 from    @xmath98    for any @xmath99 that we reach along .",
    "mathematically speaking , we must exhaust all backward paths originating from @xmath62 that have one slow edge at the end and all other edges regular .",
    "moreover , since @xmath92 for all @xmath91 , we should consider only paths that end in configurations belonging to @xmath68 .",
    "now , consider any @xmath99 that is reached by moving particles backwards from @xmath62 without crossing a slow edge .",
    "then if we start at @xmath100 and move particles forward without crossing a slow edge , we must end at @xmath62 .",
    "this ensures that by moving particles backwards in order to eliminate any @xmath97 along the way , @xmath97 will appear _ exactly _ @xmath101 times .",
    "we can then complete the l.h.s . of ( [ master_f1c ] ) ( since @xmath102 ) and substitute ( [ master_f1c ] ) in ( [ master_f1a ] ) . in the end ,",

    "let s write equations for the remaining blocked configurations ,    @xmath130    the process described by ( [ example4])-([3 ] ) can be interpreted as follows : any particle that jumps from a slow site immediately joins the queue in front , while at the same time the whole queue that the particle has just left moves one step forward .",
    "intuitively , this is easy to understand : the limit @xmath131 creates a huge separation of time scales , so that any particle that jumps from a slow sites is likely to join the queue in front before any other jump from a slow sites happens .",
    "particles are thus exchanged between compartments separated by walls , each compartment having a finite capacity which is the number of sites between two neighbouring walls .",
    "this number can be greater than @xmath8 , as in our example above , and so the process that tasep maps to in the limit @xmath131 is a generalization of the exclusion process called the _ partial _ exclusion process ( not to be confused with _ partially asymmetric _ exclusion process ) .",
    "interestingly , the partial exclusion process has been introduced long time ago by schtz @xcite , but has been rarely studied since @xcite .",
    "( left column ) to a partial exclusion process ( right column ) in ( a ) periodic boundaries case and ( b ) open boundaries case . in both cases particles",
    "move to the right.,width=226 ]    for zeroth - order terms , our result can be summarized as follows : consider the tasep with periodic boundary conditions on a lattice of @xmath2 sites , @xmath132 particles and @xmath133 slow sites placed at sites @xmath134 ( due to periodic boundary conditions , we have a freedom to place the last slow site at the end ) .",
    "then @xmath69 for @xmath70 solves the master equation of the totally asymmetric _ partial _",
    "exclusion process on a lattice of @xmath133 sites , where each site @xmath135 can hold at most @xmath136 particles , where @xmath137 ( see figure [ fig3]a ) .",
    "one striking thing about this result is that @xmath138 and therefore any @xmath69 are completely independent of the other hopping rates ( if they exist ) and instead depend only on the `` connectivity '' of blocked configurations .",
    "we will go back to this observation more in section [ further_applications ] where we discuss two or more different slow hopping rates . for now , let s just focus on what this means for the binary disorder in the open boundaries case",
    ". in the open boundaries case , all blocked configurations ( with respect to @xmath1 ) have the first compartment occupied by particles and the last one empty .",
    "if we have a lattice of @xmath2 sites and @xmath133 slow sites placed at @xmath139 , then @xmath69 for @xmath70 solves master equation of a totally asymmetric partial exclusion process on a lattice of @xmath140 sites , where each site @xmath141 holds at most @xmath142 particles . at the boundaries",
    ", particles jump into the first compartment at rate @xmath8 if it s not full and leave the lattice from the last compartment at rate @xmath8 ( see figure [ fig3]b ) .",
    "thus the rates at which particles are exchanged with reservoirs are always maximal , i.e. equal to @xmath8 .    for a small number of blocked configurations",
    "we may hope to solve ( [ system_f0a ] ) analytically ( as in section [ examples ] ) or numerically ( even for @xmath2 large ) .",
    "as the number of blocked configurations increases , since the exact solution for the steady state of the totally asymmetric partial exclusion process is not known , we may end up with a problem no less harder that the one we started with . in the next section",
    "we give a general recipe for how to calculate first - order terms @xmath143 if we can somehow solve ( [ system_f0a ] ) .",

    "we insert expressions like ( [ lambda_f1 ] ) recursively for the remaining first - order terms , until we are left with zeroth - order terms only .",

    "a ribosome binds to mrna and moves along it codon by codon translating the mrna sequence into sequence of specific amino acids . at each step , the corresponding amino acid is transported to the ribosome by trna .",
    "the availability ( abundance ) of trna is thus believed to be responsible for the time scale on which the ribosome moves along the mrna .",

    "we will not include another important ingredient for modelling translation - the fact that ribosomes bind to approximately @xmath288 codon sites - as it become technically difficult to do it in our approach due to the exclusion .",
    "for two slow sites with hopping rates @xmath289 our approach readily gives    @xmath290    this result can be easily generalized to arbitrary number @xmath291 of slow sites provided they all have different hopping rates    @xmath292    if two slow sites however share the same hopping rate @xmath1 , then ( [ j_2_derived_open ] ) applies provided all other slow hopping rates ( including @xmath12 and @xmath14 ) are mutually different and not equal to @xmath1 .",

    "it would be interesting to test this idea further using real data ( e.g. relative abundances of trna measured for _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite ) and compare it to the approximate theory of estimating currents for the disordered tasep developed in @xcite .",
    "the matrix - product ansatz and mean - field approximation are both powerful analytical approaches for studying driven diffusive systems , the asep in particular . unfortunately , in some cases such as site - wise disorder , it is not known how to apply the matrix - product ansatz and mean - field approximation is mostly reduced to numerical studies . in this article",
    "we showed how to access some exact steady - state properties of the tasep with site - wise disorder in the low - current regime , i.e. when one of the hopping rates is small .",
    "our approach is based on a simple fact , proved in [ appendix_a ] , that the steady - state ( non - normalized ) weights are polynomials in hopping rates .",
    "using this fact the steady - state average of any physical observable ( e.g. current ) can be expanded in one of the small hopping rates with coefficients that obey a specific set of equations .",
    "while our approach is not restricted particularly to the tasep , it requires that we can identify what we call blocked configurations ( configurations that the system freezes into if one of the hopping rates is set to zero ) . in that case",
    "the zeroth - order coefficients are non - zero only for blocked configurations , which drastically reduces the number of unknowns . for the tasep with binary disorder where all slow sites share the same hopping rate @xmath0",
    ", we show that the zeroth - order coefficients in the small @xmath1 expansion are in fact steady - state weights of another ( but rarely studied ) process called partial exclusion process in which more than one particle per site is allowed .",
    "this mapping , which is exact in the limit @xmath131 , is made by replacing all slow sites with boxes of capacities equal to the distances between neighbouring slow sites .",
    "a simple interpretation of this result is that the limit @xmath131 creates a huge separation of time scales between particles hopping at rates @xmath1 and @xmath8 , so that any particle that jumps across a slow site immediately joins a queue in the front .",
    "it is remarkable ( and discouraging at the same time ) that the tasep with binary disorder even in this simplified case maps to a process which itself is a hard and unsolved problem .    in cases",
    "when zeroth - order terms can still be found , we provide a recipe for calculating first - order terms , which comes down to tracking paths in the configuration space on the underlying stochastic network . in section [ examples ]",
    "we calculated zeroth - order and in some cases first - order terms in the small @xmath1 expansion of the steady - state current for particular disorder configurations previously studied in @xcite .",
    "as the number of blocked configurations increases it becomes increasingly difficult to follow this programme analytically .",
    "however , because of the mapping to the partial exclusion process the reduction of the unknowns is still huge and allows us potentially to use a computer instead , even for large lattices .    our approach can readily be applied to non - binary disorder with more than one type of slow rates , which is relevant for modelling protein synthesis . remarkably , the lowest - order coefficients we get by expanding in one of the slow hopping rates do not depend on the other hopping rates . in other words ,",
    "the low - current regime of the tasep with site - wise disorder depends only on the current - minimizing set of slow sites with equal hopping rates , regardless of other slow sites .",
    "once this subset is found ( which may be a hard problem in itself ) , one can work with binary disorder only and go from there using either the approach developed here or using e.g. phenomenological approach that looks for the largest cluster of slow sites @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that our approach can be applied to any other driven diffusive system with particles hopping unidirectionally , provided we can identify blocked configurations with respect to one of the model s hopping rates . in the network language , unidirectional hopping is necessary to avoid loops that may exist even if one of the hopping rates is equal to zero .",
    "for example , our approach does not work for langmuir kinetics @xcite or a multi - lane exclusion process where particles can change lanes @xcite .",
    "however , it could be useful for studying more complex lattice geometries without resorting to mean - field approximation or even to understand why in some instances the mean - field approximation is satisfactory .",

    "<S> we study steady state of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with inhomogeneous hopping rates associated with sites ( site - wise disorder ) . using the fact that the non - normalized steady - state weights which solve the master equation are polynomials in all the hopping rates , we propose a general method for calculating their first few lowest coefficients exactly . in case of binary disorder where all slow sites share the same hopping rate @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we apply this method to calculate steady - state current up to the quadratic term in @xmath1 for some particular disorder configurations . for the most general ( non - binary ) disorder , </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the low - current regime the current is determined solely by the current - minimizing subset of equal hopping rates , regardless of other hopping rates . </S>",
    "<S> our approach can be readily applied to any other driven diffusive system with unidirectional hopping if one can identify a hopping rate such that the current vanishes when this rate is set to zero . </S>"
