    "local compact groups of galaxies are excellent places where to study galaxy transformation . as a consequence of the strong gravitational encounters ,",
    "galaxies in compact groups develop tidal tails , bursts of star formation , gas flows , nuclear activity and kinematic perturbations .",
    "all these phenomena have strong influences on the evolution of galaxies in compact groups .",
    "for example , simulations suggest the existence of gas inflows in merging systems . these flows can mix the metal content of the interacting galaxies ( rupke et al .",
    "2010a , perez et al . 2011 ) , and can enhance the star formation of the central parts of the interacting / merging systems , increasing their ir luminosities .",
    "on the other hand , such interactions can affect the global kinematics of the galaxies in the compact group .",
    "this effect can be easily seen in the 2d velocity fields of such systems ( amram et al .",
    "2003 , plana et al .",
    "given that all the phenomena listed above are connected , it will be desirable to analyze all of them simultaneously , which in practice is not an easy task , given the lack of proper data and/or instrumental limitations . a way to circumvent",
    "some of these limitations is to use ifu ( integral field unit ) spectroscopic data , given that this technique allows us to observe simultaneously the spectra of several regions , where the galaxy configuration is compact enough .",
    "we have obtained ifu observations of one of the most interesting compact groups of galaxies : hickson compact group 31 ( hcg 31 , hickson 1982 ) , in order to study the evolutionary phase of this group and to search for a link between its kinematics and chemical enrichment history .",
    "in addition , this system is an ideal laboratory to study star formation at different levels ( from small to giant star - forming regions ) , therefore , ifu data on hcg 31 will be extremely useful to understand the star formation process in interacting / merging galaxies .",
    "the hickson compact group 31 is an intriguing object because of its wide range of indicators of galaxy interaction and merging , like multiple tidal tails , irregular morphology , complex kinematics , strong starburst spots and possible formation of tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) ( rubin et al .",

    "hcg 31 is formed by several members : a+c , b , e , f , g , h , q and r ( mendes de oliveira et al . 2006 ) . galaxies a and c form the main central part .",
    "these are late - type , gas - rich , large magellanic - type irregular galaxies ( amram et al .",
    "2007 ) , which could be responsible for the two optical tidal tails that extend towards the northeast and southwest of the a+c system .",
    "in addition , tdg candidates seem to have been formed out of gas - rich material stripped from this system ( lpez - snchez et al .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed to explain the nature of the system a+c : the system a+c is a single entity , i.e. a single interacting galaxy ( richer et al . 2003 ) and a second scenario supports the idea that there are two systems in a merging process ( rubin et al .",
    "this latter scenario is supported by amram et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who found that the dynamics of the a+c system has two main different components of approximately the same intensities , indicating that it is in a pre - merging stage .",
    "in this paper we present integral field spectroscopic observations of the central region of hcg 31 .",
    "we describe the gemini integral field spectroscopic observations , data reductions and analysis in sections  2 and  3 respectively .",
    "our results are presented in section  4 .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in sections  5 and  6 , respectively .",

    "1992 ) and h@xmath2kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the central region of hcg 31 was observed with the gemini south telescope during the nights between january 12 - 19 , 2013 , with gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos , hook et al .",
    "2004 ) and the integral field unit ( ifu , allington - smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , under the program gs-2012b - q-60 ( pi : s. torres - flores ) . in order to have a larger spatial coverage and",
    "map the whole a+c system , three different fields were observed with the ifu in two - slit mode .",
    "the spectra and calibrations were acquired using the grating r400@xmath4r-filter centered at 6300 . in the two - slit mode ,",
    "the ifu covers a field of view of 7@xmath55  .",
    "each ifu hexagonal element ( the two - slit mode uses 1500 elements ) has a projected scale of 0.2  on the sky . for each field ,",
    "three exposures of 700 sec each were obtained ( no spectral or spatial dithering was applied during the observations ) .",
    "all fields were observed during dark time ( sky background 50% ) at an airmass between 1.23 and 1.31 , with median seeing values of @xmath60.5  and 0.6  and were not taken under photometric conditions ( cloud cover : 70% cirrus ) .",
    "figure [ hcg31 ] shows an hst optical image ( acs , f435w ) with the location of the three gmos / ifu fields superimposed onto it ( `` east '' , `` center '' and `` west '' fields , respectively ) . in addition , the spectrophotometric standard star ltt 4364 was observed in january 15 , 2013 to flux calibrate the science spectrum .",
    "the observations were processed using a modified early version of the gemini / gmos iraf package to reduce ifu spectra .",
    "a master bias was generated by combined raw bias frames .",
    "then all science exposures , comparison lamps , spectroscopic twilight flats and gemini calibration unit lamp flats ( gcal flats ) were overscan - ed / trimmed , and bias subtracted using the master bias .",
    "fibers identification was performed with the task `` gfreduce '' using high signal - to - noise gcal flats .",
    "the resulting file with the fiber identifications was used later as a reference to identify the fibers in the comparison lamps , science exposures and spectroscopic twilight flats .",
    "the gcal flats were processed by removing the gcal@xmath4gmos spectral response and the uneven illumination introduced by the gcal unit .",
    "the twilight flats were used to determine the relative fiber throughput and to correct for any illumination pattern in the gcal flat using the `` gfresponse '' task .",
    "wavelength calibration has been obtained using high signal - to - noise cuar comparison lamp using the `` gswavelength '' routine .",
    "the residual values in the wavelength solution typically yielded a rms of @xmath60.1 .",
    "the science exposure are then flat - fielded , corrected by the relative fiber throughput , wavelength calibrated , sky subtracted and extracted .",
    "the same reduction steps were applied to process the standard star ltt 4364 .",
    "the sensitivity function was derived using the `` gsstandard '' routine and the science exposures were then flux calibrated using the routine `` gscalibrate '' .",
    "the final step was the construction of data cubes for further analysis .",
    "each processed 2d science image was transformed to a 3d data cube ( x , y , @xmath7 ) using the `` gfcube '' routine .",
    "the output data cubes ( 3 per field ) were re - sampled to square pixels 0.1  in size and corrected for atmospheric differential refraction . to produce a single data cube for each field",

    "the optical emission of the central region of hcg 31a+c is dominated by two main bursts of star formation which coincide with the centers of galaxies hcg 31a and hcg 31c ( iglesias - pramo & vlchez 1997 ) .",
    "the ages of these bursts are very similar and therefore it is inferred that they were triggered by the interaction between galaxies a and c ( iglesias - pramo & vlchez 1997 ) .",
    "lpez - snchez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) detected some underlying stellar emission associated with these bursts .",
    "however , it is negligible compared with the strong emission coming from the nebular lines . in this work",
    "we will focus on the flux coming from the ionized gas . in figure [ espectro ]",
    "we show a typical spectrum observed in the central region of hcg 31a+c .",
    "this spectrum is dominated by strong emission lines , where the line ratios are typical of star - forming regions in the bpt plot ( baldwin et al .",
    "1981 ) , with almost no emission coming from an underlying stellar population .",
    "in figure [ map_hst ] we have included an optical image of the _ hst_/acs ( f435w ) for the system hcg 31a+c , where we have over plotted the three ifu fields in red rectangles ( 5@xmath57  or @xmath61355@xmath51897 pc each ) . in addition , we have over plotted the position of the two main bursts of star formation detected by iglesias - pramo & vlchez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in yellow squares , which are located in the galaxies hcg 31c and hcg 31a ( boxes have sizes 1.1@xmath51.1  , or @xmath6298@xmath5298 pc ) .",
    "the box size was chosen considering the burst associated to the galaxy hcg 31c , since this burst shows a stronger and more extended h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the mean values of the different physical parameters of these two main bursts were obtained considering this area .",
    "observed flux should be affected by galactic and internal extinctions .",
    "we have corrected the observed flux for galactic extinction by using a color excess of ( ned database ) and the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) extinction law .",
    "the internal extinction clearly depends on the internal properties of the observed source .",
    "starburst objects are usually dusty and , therefore , we expect to have high internal extinctions .",
    "we note that the spectral coverage of our observations do not allow us to derive the h@xmath0/h@xmath8 ratio to determine the internal extinction through the balmer decrement .",
    "therefore , in order to correct for this effect , we have used the spectra published by mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to obtain an average nebular color excess for the central region of hcg 31a+c . in this case",
    ", the nebular color excess was estimated by using the observed h@xmath0/h@xmath8 ratio and comparing it with the expected value listed in osterbrock ( 1989 ) , using the recipes given in dominguez et al .",
    "we obtain an average nebular color excess of e(b - v)@xmath60.08mag . given that hcg 31a and hcg 31c are starburst objects ( gallagher et al .",
    "2010 ) , we have used the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) extinction law to correct our data by internal extinction , considering the nebular color excess estimated above ( which is a factor of @xmath62 larger than the stellar color excess ) .",
    "we note that the extinction correction is not a critical issue for line ratios ( given that the emission lines display a small wavelength separation ) . however , this correction is important for the estimation of h@xmath0 luminosities and star formation rates .",
    "+      the main nebular emission lines available in our data correspond to [ nii]@xmath76548 , h@xmath0@xmath76563 , [ nii]@xmath76584 , [ sii]@xmath76717 and [ sii]@xmath76731 .",
    "the available spectral resolution of fwhm=2.4 ( @xmath6114kms@xmath3 , value adopted from method ( ii ) , see next section ) does not allow us to resolve multiple components on each emission line profile . for this reason",
    ", fluxes have been estimated by fitting a single gaussian on each observed line , by using fluxer which allows us to determine the continuum level around the emission lines in a confident way .",
    "the stellar continuum definition was made in the wavelength range of 6620 - 6690 .",
    "the output parameters of this procedure are flux , continuum , width , center , equivalent width and uncertainties derived from the 2d maps .",
    "fluxes were compared with the values estimated by fitting a single gaussian with the mpfit code and with the task splot in iraf , and the results are fully consistent . given that , we have included the h@xmath0 emission and stellar continuum emission maps in the top and bottom panels in figure [ map_flux ] , respectively .",
    "the most intense emission line in our data set is h@xmath0 .",
    "this emission line is usually used to analyze the kinematics of the warm gas in galaxies ( e.g amram et al .",
    "we used it to derive the velocity field of the central region of hcg 31 .",
    "as described above , the gaussian fitting process gives us the center of each emission line . in this case , the estimated center was converted into velocity , yielding a velocity field . in a similar way",
    ", we used the width of the profiles to produce a velocity dispersion map . at first order ,",
    "if we suppose that the different emission line profiles can be fitted by gaussians , the velocity dispersion @xmath9 corrected for instrumental and thermal broadening could be written as : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the measured velocity dispersion on the observed profile .",
    "the instrumental width @xmath12 was estimated in two different ways which resulted in consistent values : ( i ) from the average of the fwhm of the lines from the cuar calibration lamp close to h@xmath0 , obtaining a spectral resolution of @xmath62.3@xmath130.1 , corresponding to @xmath6110kms@xmath3 , leading to a resolution r@xmath62850@xmath13125 ( in h@xmath0 ) , and ( ii ) following the method published by snchez et al . (",
    "2012 ) , who estimate the spectral resolution fitting a gaussian in the most intense sky lines in one frame . in our case",
    ", we have obtained an average of @xmath62.4@xmath130.1 , corresponding to @xmath6114kms@xmath3 , leading to a resolution r@xmath62730@xmath13115 .",
    "finally , we adopt the value obtained from the second method . from this method",
    "we have estimated a instrumental width of @xmath1446@xmath1310kms@xmath3 , where the uncertainty is represented by the standard deviation following snchez et al .",
    "( 2012 ) method .",
    "we found a change in the value of the instrumental width across each observed fields . on average ,",
    "this variation is of the order of @xmath610kms@xmath3 .",
    "however , we note that the largest changes in this parameters occur at the edge of the fields , while in the centre of the fields the variation in the instrumental width is close to @xmath66kms@xmath3 . for the thermal width correction",
    "we have assumed a @xmath15=9kms@xmath3 , that corresponds to a electron temperature of 10000k ( which is consistent with the temperatures estimated by lpez - snchez et al .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the corrected velocity dispersion was estimated by propagating in quadrature the uncertainties of @xmath12 and @xmath11 . on top and bottom",
    "panels in figure [ map_vel ] , we present the velocity and velocity dispersion maps , respectively .",
    "there are several tracers of star formation .",
    "for example , the uv radiation emerging from young hot stars can be used to estimate the star formation rate of galaxies .",
    "however , this emission considers stellar populations with ages up to @xmath6200 myrs .",
    "also , this emission is strongly affected by dust attenuation . to mitigate these problems , several authors use the uv and ir emission ( e.g. iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2006 and more recently eufrasio et al .",
    "2014 ) , in order to take into account the emission of dust that is heated by the strong uv radiation field .",
    "another way to estimate star formation rates is to use the h@xmath0 emission , which emerges from gas ionized by massive stars .",
    "given the available data , the star formation rates in hcg 31 have been estimated by using its h@xmath0 luminosity and the recipe given in kennicutt ( 1998 ) , which assumes a continuous star formation process , where . however , we note that the sfrs derived from the h@xmath16 emission can be underestimated given that this emission is affected by extinction , which corresponds to one of the most important sources of uncertainties in the determinations of sfr when using h@xmath16 luminosities ( kennicutt 1998 ) . in the case of the current analysis , we have derived an average extinction for the region under study , which comes from the balmer decrement of archival longslit observations .",
    "of course , the extinction can vary along the extension of hcg 31 a+c , given the strong burst of star formation located in this region . therefore",
    ", we caution the reader that our sfrs estimations can be affected by spatial variations in the extinction , therefore , our sfrs can be overestimated ( discussed in  [ properties ] ) .",
    "our spectroscopic data cover the [ sii ] lines , [ sii]@xmath76717 and [ sii]@xmath76731 .",
    "we have calculated the electron density ( n@xmath17 ) from the observed ratio using the task temden , which belongs to the iraf stsdas nebular package .",
    "the task temden implement the five - level atomic model fivel ( de robertis , dufour & hunt 1987 ) .",
    "we are not able to estimate the electron temperatures due to the spectral coverage ( @xmath656206980 ) .",
    "so , in this case we have assumed an electronic temperature of t@xmath17=10000k .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the electronic temperature found by lpez - snchez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the burst associated with hcg 31c ( t@xmath17=10800@xmath13300k , table 3 in that paper ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the estimates are represented by the standard deviation .",
    "the electron density map obtained using this method is shown on the top panel of figure [ map_abundance ] .",
    "we estimated the ages of the bursts by comparing the measured h@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew(h@xmath0 ) ) with starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) modelled values .",

    "these authors propose that these complexes could be formed by several stellar clusters , so the complex 1 could include the star formation burst associated to the galaxy hcg 31c and a stellar cluster , which we suggest would be cleaning its environment and triggering star formation in its neighborhood .",
    "recently , krabbe et al . (",
    "2014 ) estimated the electron density for a few hii regions located in interacting galaxies .",
    "these authors found that hii regions in interacting galaxies display systematically higher electron densities than those derived for hii regions belonging to isolated galaxies ( taken from the literature ) .",
    "these authors found that the mean electron densities of star - forming regions in interacting galaxies are in the range of , while those obtained for isolated galaxies are in the range of .",
    "our estimations of electron density for hcg 31a and hcg 31c are in the range displayed by the interacting sample of krabbe et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , which is consistent with the interaction scenario for hcg 31a+c .",
    "for the first time , we report the detection of a super stellar cluster candidate which could be an evidence of current and triggered star formation process in hcg 31a+c .",
    "in addition , despite several studies have been developed to understand the compact group hcg 31 , the spatial resolution of the ifu observations allowed us to carry out a detailed analysis of different structures in the system hcg 31a+c . with this information",
    "we estimate several physical properties in this system and we describe the star formation bursts in this region in a more detailed way .      because of its complex morphology",
    ", several authors have suggested different scenarios to explain the origin of hcg 31 . as mentioned earlier , richer et al . (",
    "2003 ) , using fabry - perot and spectroscopic data , suggest that galaxies hcg 31a and hcg 31c are a single entity .",
    "oppositely , amram et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used high resolution fabry - perot data to suggest that both systems are independent late - type galaxies , in a pre - merger phase .",
    "this last scenario is also supported by the results presented in this paper .    in this context ,",
    "the sfrs estimated can give us evidence about the merging scenario supported by amram et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . considering the area for the sfr estimation in the region `` center '' , which correspond to @xmath62.57 kpc@xmath20",
    ", we obtain a star formation density of for a .",
    "although we do not have the information about the quantity of atomic and molecular gas for hcg 31a+c , this star formation density locate this object in the upper region of the log@xmath21 versus log@xmath22 plot presented by daddi et al .",
    "( 2010 , figure 2 in that paper ) . this fact suggest that hcg 31a+c is a strong starburst object",
    ". it will be difficult to reconcile this high star formation density with a single low mass galaxy , therefore , these results support the scenario on which hcg 31 is a merging object and not a single entity .      in  [ kinematics ] and ",
    "[ sigmavsintensity ] we suggest the existence of a super stellar cluster located @xmath61  ( 270pc ) from the star formation burst associated to the galaxy hcg 31c .",
    "this super stellar cluster candidate presents an intense stellar continuum emission , with respect to its vicinity .",
    "besides , this object is spatially associated with a region with high velocity dispersions up to .",
    "this fact suggests that the super cluster would be cleaning its environment through a shell in expansion which should be produced by the strong stellar winds and/or the energy coming from supernovae events .",
    "the strong interactions of these winds and the environment seems to be triggering star formation in its neighborhood , since we can detect a strong h@xmath0 emission 270pc away . in order to check if this scenario is possible , we can estimate the velocity of the expanding bubble associated with the super stellar cluster , in order to determine if this quantity is in the range of expected values . considering that the distance from the stellar cluster to the h@xmath0 peak is about @xmath6270 pc , and taking into account that the age of the complex is about 5myrs ( this work and lpez - snchez et al .",
    "2004 ) , we derive an expanding velocity of @xmath653kms@xmath3 . this value is consistent with the expanding velocity of some giant hii regions located in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "for example , rosado et al .",
    "( 1996 ) measured an expanding velocity of 45kms@xmath3 in the central region of n11 .",
    "clearly , the star - forming complex in hcg 31 is much brighter than regions like n11 , even 30 dor , however , this estimate does not discard the scenario proposed above .",
    "in fact , triggered star formation has been found in local galaxies , like the lmc , where it is possible to resolve individual stars ( see review by elmegreen 2011 on this topic ) .",
    "other region widely studied is ngc 604 , in the spiral galaxy m33 .",
    "the proposed scenario to explain the presence of the super stellar cluster candidate , which is triggering star formation in hcg 31c , is consistent with the one proposed by tosaki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the giant hii region ngc 604 .",
    "these authors detected a high co(j=3 - 2)/co(j=1 - 0 ) ratio gas with an arclike distribution ( called by the authors `` high - ratio gas arc '' ) around the stellar cluster of ngc 604 .",
    "these authors proposed a relation between the _",
    "`` high - ratio gas arc '' _ , the stellar cluster and the `` new '' stars in the h@xmath0 shell , suggesting the following scenario : in a first place , there would be what they called a  first - generation star formation \" associated to the central stellar cluster . then",
    ", by some common phenomenon such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions , there should be compression of the surrounding ism which would result in a dense gas layer formed like an arclike distribution ( the _ `` high - ratio gas arc '' _ ) .",
    "then , new stars would be formed within the dense gas layer , what they called a  second - generation star formation \" , which is triggered by the stellar cluster ( the first - generation stars ) .",
    "if this proposed scenario is correct , one could then observe this second star population in the mentioned dense gas layer in two ways , as shells emitting in h@xmath0 and compact radio continuum sources .",
    "tosaki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) mentioned that these facts suggest that the hii regions in the `` high - ratio gas '' arc are regions with current star formation , and the regions with past star formation corresponds to the central star cluster , which has dispersed the ism around .",
    "the scenario proposed by tosaki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for ngc 604 was supported by other authors ( e.g. martnez - galarza et al .",
    "2012 , through the use of infrared data ) . in order to confirm this scenario in the central region of hcg 31a+c",
    "we would need new infrared and co information .",
    "in addition , the scenario presented in this work is consistent with the `` two - stage starburst '' model proposed by walborn & parker ( 1992 ) . in this model",
    "there is a concentrated star - forming burst which triggers a second burst after 2myrs .",
    "this second generation of stars is formed in the molecular clouds located in the periphery of the primary star - forming burst , which would be caused by the energy coming from massive stars .",
    "we found a difference of 4myrs between the super star cluster and the star - forming burst in hcg 31c , and considering the uncertainties , the scenario we suggest is consistent with this model .",
    "this star - forming mechanism is described by elmegreen ( 1998 ) , who called it `` large scale triggering : shells or rings '' . in this mechanism",
    "the ionized gas expansion triggers shell formation , which triggers star formation in its periphery .",
    "elmegreen ( 1998 ) points out that the shell size depends on the pressure and environment density , where in low density environments the shell can reach a size of a few hundred parsecs .",
    "these values are reached by the super shell , which we suggest is triggering star formation in hcg 31a+c ( @xmath6300pc ) .",
    "for the first time , integral field spectroscopy data of the merging system hcg 31 is presented , specifically of hcg 31a+c . with all the data analysis and the different estimates of physical properties for this system , we suggest a triggered star formation scenario , where we propose the existence of a super stellar cluster candidate next to the star forming burst associated with hcg 31c .",
    "the strong stellar winds associated with this source seem to be triggering a star formation event in its neighborhood .",
    "our data set supports the scenario that suggests that the central region of hcg 31 is a merger between two late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "this merger process has triggered the star formation in the center of hcg 31 , namely , hcg 31a+c .",
    "the study we present in this paper shows the power of ifu data in analyzing interactions in merging galaxies .",
