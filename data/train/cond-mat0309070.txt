    "<S> we discuss the applicability of two very different analytic approaches to the study of pulse propagation in a chain of particles interacting via a hertz potential , namely , a continuum model and a binary collision approximation . </S>",
    "<S> while both methods capture some qualitative features equally well , the first is quantitatively good for softer potentials and the latter is better for harder potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics of a chain of particles interacting via a granular potential , i.e. a potential that is repulsive under loading and zero otherwise , remains a challenge despite a great deal of recent work on the subject  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies of pulse dynamics in frictionless chains have relied primarily on numerical solution of the equations of motion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analytic work has relied on two rather different approximations with very little direct comparison between them . </S>",
    "<S> one approach is based on continuum approximations to the equations equations of motion followed by exact or approximate solutions of these approximate equations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is expected to give useful results when the pulse is not too narrow , i.e. , when the velocity distribution of the grains in the chain at any instant of time is rather smooth . </S>",
    "<S> the other approach is based on phenomenology about properties of pairwise ( or at times three - body ) collisions together with the assumption that pulses are sufficiently narrow to involve only two or three grains at any one time  @xcite . among the interesting quantities </S>",
    "<S> one aims to calculate with these approaches is the pulse velocity . in turn , successful calculation of the pulse velocity requires a good understanding of the pulse width .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard generic model potential between monodisperse elastic granules that repel upon overlap according to the hertz law is given by  @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 @xmath2 is a constant that depends on the young s modulus and poisson s ratio , and @xmath3 is the displacement of granule @xmath4 from its equilibrium position . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath5 is @xmath6 for spheres , it is @xmath7 for cylinders , and in general depends on geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> the displacement of the @xmath4-th granule ( @xmath8 ) in the chain from its equilibrium position in a frictionless medium is thus governed by the equation of motion @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the heavyside function , @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 for @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it ensures that the particles interact only when in contact . </S>",
    "<S> note that for a finite open chain the first term on the right hand side of this equation is absent for the last granule and the second term is absent for the first .    initially the granules are placed along a line so that they just touch their neighbors in their equilibrium positions ( no precompression ) , and all but the leftmost particle are at rest . </S>",
    "<S> the initial velocity of the leftmost particle is @xmath16 ( the impulse ) . in terms of the rescaled variables </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : motion ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath18 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath19 . in the rescaled variables the initial conditions become @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    when @xmath24 an initial impulse settles into a pulse that is increasingly narrow with increasing @xmath5 , and propagates at a velocity that is essentially constant and determined by @xmath5 and by the amplitude of the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath25 the pulse spreads in time and travels at a constant velocity independent of pulse amplitude . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> there is considerable backscattering that leads to backward motion of all the granules behind the pulse , whereas the backscattering is minimal for @xmath24  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse is a completely conservative solitary wave in the limit @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> three features determine pulse dynamics in these chains :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the power @xmath5 in the potential ; 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a restoring force ; and 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the discreteness of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , we discussed the role each of these features in the continuum approximation and extended previous results to include viscosity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not only does this approximation work very well for the @xmath25 case  @xcite , but , corroborating nesterenko s theory@xcite , we found that the continuum approximation works surprisingly well for the prototypical grain , namely spheres . </S>",
    "<S> however , a discussion of the reasons for this agreement seems to be lacking . on the other hand , models based on binary interactions have also been proposed in order to study a chain of spherical and other grains . </S>",
    "<S> wu s independent - collision model  @xcite focuses on a chain of tapered grains . from energy and momentum conservation considerations , working in the @xmath27 limit </S>",
    "<S> , he shows that his simple model captures the qualitative behavior observed in simulations for spheres . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently this model was phenomenologically extended and compared with experimental results  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    herein we address the question of the applicability of both the continuum approximation and a binary interaction model through the analysis of the velocity of the signal propagation as a function of the power of the potential . for the former case , </S>",
    "<S> the pulse velocity , @xmath28 can be written as  @xcite @xmath29^\\frac{n-2}{2n } , \\label{eq : velcont}\\ ] ] where @xmath30    on the other hand , for the binary collision approximation the set of equations  ( [ eq : motion_rescaled ] ) reduces to two coupled equations which may be decoupled by defining the normal mode variables @xmath31 in particular , we have @xmath32 this is precisely the equation of motion for one particle subjected to a potential @xmath33 furthermore , the initial conditions for the original variables lead to @xmath34 and @xmath35 hence , from energy conservation we have : @xmath36 consequently , when the two particles have the same velocity ( @xmath37 ) , their compression will be a maximum and given by @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the time necessary for the `` pulse '' to travel from the first to the second particle is @xmath39 explicitly integrating eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : timebinary ] ) , we can write the pulse velocity @xmath40 as @xmath41 our comparison is thus between eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : velcont ] ) and ( [ eq : velbinary ] ) .     in the pulse velocity as a function of the power of the potential . here , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical pulse velocity @xmath42 , is either the one obtained from the continuum ( circles ) or from the binary collision ( squares ) approximation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 is the pulse velocity obtained from the numerical simulations of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel2],width=302 ]    qualitatively both approximations give the same result : for @xmath44 the pulse velocity decreases with @xmath5 , attaining its minimum value for @xmath45 , and then increasing and saturating for large @xmath5 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , however , they differ appreciably . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for large @xmath5 , @xmath46 while @xmath47 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel2 ] we present the relative error of our numerical simulation of the chain as compared with each theory . from this figure , it is easy to see that while the continuum approximation gives very good results for small @xmath5 , its predictions are poor for @xmath48 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the binary collision approximation is extremely accurate for @xmath49 but not accurate for small @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative agreement of each of the two analytic results at their respective @xmath5 extremes with the numerical simulations is seen to be excellent . </S>",
    "<S> again , we stress that _ these results are a reflection of the behavior of the pulse width_. at smaller @xmath5 the pulse is relatively broad , the velocity pulse covers a number of grains  @xcite , and a continuum approximation captures the pulse configuration and speed very well . at larger @xmath5 the pulse becomes very narrow , discreteness effects dominate the behavior , and an approximation that assumes that two - grain collisions dominate the pulse behavior reproduces the pulse velocity extremely accurately .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> nesterenko s continuum approximation gives quantitatively accurate results for the pulse velocity for relatively soft potentials , @xmath50 ( which includes the generic cases of cylindrical and spherical grains ) , while the binary collision model is quantitatively correct for relatively hard potentials , @xmath48 . </S>"
