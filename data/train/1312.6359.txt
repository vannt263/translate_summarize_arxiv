    "in this paper we study some problems of the theory of cluster sets , a theory which is developed in the second half of the twentieth century .",
    "it is believed that the first result of this theory were obtained by sohotsky @xcite , and independently by cazorati @xcite in 1868th , and weierstrass @xcite in 1876th , which is known in literature as the theorem on essential singularity of analytic functions ( see @xcite p. 123 ) .",
    "fundamentals of the theory of cluster sets are presented in monographs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and in the more recent survey paper @xcite .",
    "the main objects of research in this paper is the asymptotic behavior of meromorphic functions along a simple curve ending in a boundary point of the domain of functions .",
    "we emphasize that a very productive area of investigation are domains of the hyperbolic type , i.e. , domains where one may define the hyperbolic metric .",
    "one of the classical results of the theory of cluster sets related to the asymptotic behavior is the theorem of lindelf on angular boundary values of analytic functions @xcite ( or , see @xcite ) .",
    "further interesting results on the boundary behavior of analytic functions along simple curves were obtained by seidel @xcite and seidel and walsh @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "lehto and virtanen s result from @xcite , which is a transfer of the results of lindelf and seidel and walsh to the class of normal meromorphic functions in the unit disc , the class usually denoted by @xmath1 , prompted a further intensive research in the theory of cluster sets .",
    "these investigations were also related to the boundary behavior of functions along sequences of points on the one hand , and on the boundary behavior of harmonic , subharmonic , continuous functions , and normal quasiconformal and equimorphic mappings along ( non)tangential simple curves ( see references ) .    while most of these papers concern the boundary properties of functions along simple curves which are at the finite frshet distance or finite hausdorff distance ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) , in this paper we define a relation of equivalence in the family of all simple curves in the unit disc which terminate in the same point on the boundary , and study the boundary behavior of functions along classes of equivalence .",
    "we also offer an example of two simple curves ending in a point of the boundary of the unit disc which belong to the same equivalence class , such that their frshet distance is infinite .",
    "this the content of lemma [ le4 ] .",
    "thus , our results in the paper are generalization of some known results .",
    "namely , using the mentioned relation of equivalence we prove the theorem that give necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary function defined in the unit disk to has a curvilinear boundary value ( see theorem [ th1 ] ) .",
    "this theorem is used in proof of theorem [ th2 ] , which shows that for an arbitrary function in the unit disk holds an analogue of theorem 1 in @xcite concerning the meromorphic functions . as follows from our theorem [ th1 ] ,",
    "the normality along simple curves is a necessary condition for the existence of curvilinear boundary value of functions . in section 5",
    "we study the normality and boundary behavior of meromorphic functions using the @xmath0sequences .",
    "we emphasis that the @xmath0sequences provide necessary and sufficient conditions for meromorphic functions to be normal ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "further , in section 6 we prove theorems that give necessary and sufficient conditions in order that a meromorphic function in the unit disk has a curvilinear boundary value ( see theorems [ th14 ] and [ th15 ] ) .",
    "these theorems are analogous to the theorems 2 , 2 , 4 and 5 in lehto and virtanen work @xcite . while theorem 2 , 2 , 4 and 5 of lehto and virtanen concern the class @xmath1 of normal meromorphic function in the unit disk , the results of theorems [ th14 ] and [ th15 ] are related to the class of normal meromorphic functions along a simple curve ending in a boundary point of the unit disc .",
    "these classes are wider than the class @xmath1 ; that will be showed by examples [ ex1 ] and [ ex2 ] in section 7 .",
    "our results are applied in section 8 in order to derive theorem [ th16 ] , which shows that the domain along which there is a single boundary value of meromorphic functions in @xmath1 from theorems 2 , 2 , 4 and 5 in lehto and virtanen work @xcite can spread in the case of simple curves which are tangent to the boundary of the unit disc .",
    "however , one can not obtain an extension by using the method of lehto and virtanen .",
    "finally , our results are used to show the uniqueness theorem of aginjan @xcite which is related to the class of boundary analytic functions , and it s generalization to the class @xmath1 that was obtained by gavrilov @xcite .",
    "we prove a similar result for the class of meromorphic functions in the unit disk that are normal along non  tangential simple curves .",

    "let @xmath7 stands for the pseudo ",
    "hyperbolic distance and the hyperbolic distance between @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "it is well known that @xmath9 is a metric in the unit disc , and that @xmath10 is the poincar disc model for the lobachevsky geometry",
