    "lattice spin systems are idealized mathematical models of magnetic materials . in the absence of external disturbances such systems are in equilibrium , and governed by the gibbs - boltzmann distribution @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the energy ( or hamiltonian ) of a micro - state @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the inverse rescaled temperature , and @xmath8 is the partition function . if the set @xmath9 of individual spin states is continuous , the sum in @xmath10 becomes an integral .",
    "the averages of macroscopic functions of micro - states ( observables ) , such as the total energy or the magnetization , can be obtained by differentiation from the free energy @xmath11 , which is related to the internal energy @xmath12 and the gibbs - shannon entropy @xmath13 via the thermodynamic relation @xmath14 .",
    "however , computing @xmath15 analytically for an interacting system of macroscopic size is difficult , and to date only few lattice spin models models have been solved exactly  @xcite .    to circumvent the above problem one often approximates the true micro - state distribution @xmath16 with a simpler alternative @xmath17 , which retains only some characteristics of the original model .",
    "this approximation can usually be interpreted as a deformation of the true topology of the lattice such that short loops are removed and the analytical computations of thermal averages become easier , in combination with a variational approach that utilises the inequality @xmath18\\geq 0 $ ] .",
    "the variational mean - field ( v - mf ) approximation , see e.g.  @xcite , uses the probability distribution @xmath17 of a non - interacting system in this inequality . for @xmath19",
    "its results are equal to the results of exactly solvable ( ferromagnetic ) spin systems on complete graphs  @xcite , but for @xmath0-dimensional lattices they are unreliable .",
    "it predicts incorrectly , for instance , a phase transition in the @xmath20-dimensional ising model .",
    "however , its predictions for critical exponents are correct for ferromagnetic spin systems when @xmath21 ; see  @xcite for a unified proof of this result and references to relevant earlier work .    in the bethe - peierls ( bp )",
    "approximation ( also known as belief propagation in computer science  @xcite , or the cavity method in the spin glass community  @xcite ) one replaces the original lattices by tree - like graphs , which enables a recursive computation of thermal averages .",
    "one such graph is the bethe lattice  @xcite , usually defined as the ` central ' part of an infinitely large cayley tree  @xcite .",
    "closely related to the bethe lattice is the random regular graph ( rrg ) , defined as a maximally random graph in which all vertices have the same degree   @xcite .",
    "rrgs do have loops , but these are typically of length @xmath22 as @xmath19 , so rrgs are locally tree - like",
    ". for ferromagnetic models , bethe lattices and rrgs give the same results @xcite , but in antiferromagnetic and spin - glass models the loops in the rrgs generate frustration , and can not be ignored  @xcite .",
    "the bp approximation is more reliable than the mf approximation  @xcite , since it involves a less brutal deformation of the original lattice , and it is exact for ferromagnetic ising models on locally tree - like random graphs  @xcite ; it is interesting that , despite the fact that they can be solved relatively easily , the behaviour of ising models on trees is more complex than in @xmath0-dimensional lattices  @xcite .",
    "further improvements of the bp approximation were obtained by correcting the bp solution for rare loops  @xcite ; the improved theory is exact for a bethe lattice with exactly one loop  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study spin models in which not only the correct coordination numbers of @xmath0-dimensional cubic lattices are retained , but ( unlike the v - mf , bp , and rrg approximations ) also the statistics of short loops and many of their nestings .",
    "the spins in our models occupy the vertices of bethe - type lattices constructed from @xmath0-dimensional hypercubes , i.e. from the cells ( squares , cubes , etc . ) of the conventional @xmath0-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "these hypercubic bethe lattices can be seen as generalisations of husimi lattices  @xcite , which are bethe lattices constructed from loops such that no edge lies in more than one loop .",

    "our phase diagrams are compared with onsager s exact result for the @xmath24 square lattice , and with high- and low - temperature expansions and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation results for cubic lattices with @xmath25 .",
