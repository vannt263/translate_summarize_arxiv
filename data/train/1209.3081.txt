    "the stochastic movement of a macromolecule is usually described by langevin equation , in which the newtonian equation of motion is augmented by two additional force terms as consequences of thermal collisions with solvent molecules @xcite .",
    "one term represents a frictional force and the other is a random fluctuating force , connecting to each other through einstein relation @xcite .",
    "when the frictional force dominates over inertial effects , the langevin equation on the whole phase space could be further simplified into a first - order stochastic differential equation , i.e. overdamped dynamics , the corresponding time evolution of whose probability density function is given by the smoluchowski equation @xcite .",
    "the very wide range of applications of the overdamped dynamics is also due to the fact that the microscopic and nanometric world of soft condensed matters is indeed at very low reynolds numbers , which is the ratio of the inertial force and the viscous force @xcite , guaranteeing the validity of the overdamped approximation for modeling cellular dynamics .",
    "the overdamped dynamics without inertia is also an ideal model for studying nonequilibrium thermodynamics , which has been extensively studied for many years @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the condition of time - reversibility for second - order stochastic processes , which original langevin equation belongs to , has already been derived @xcite , and two different corresponding entropy production rates were already put forward @xcite .",
    "also , it was recently found that the overdamped approximation of langevin equation fails to preserve the entropy production rate @xcite , and an anomalous entropy production arises in the limit of small inertia .",
    "most of the previous works on the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of second - order stochastic processes were carried out from the perspective of fluctuation theorem , i.e. at the level of single trajectories @xcite . however",
    ", what we can really measure is the fluxes of all physical quantities .",
    "therefore , we turn to investigate from the perspective of fluxes @xcite . in sec .",
    "ii , basic notations and the condition of time - reversibility for second - order stochastic processes are given ( eq .",
    "( [ condition2 ] ) ) , and the detailed balancing of spatial and velocity fluxes at steady state is emphasized ( eq .",
    "( [ detailed_balance ] ) ) . in sec .",
    "iii , two simple examples with velocity - dependent external force are investigated , which are time - reversible but donot satisfy the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "it further gives rise to a second condition for thermodynamic equilibrium beyond time - reversibility ( eq .",
    "( [ condition3 ] ) ) . in sec .",
    "iv , we find out the two conditions correspond to two different entropy production rates respectively , and the entropy balance equation for one of them is related to the spatial densities of heat dissipation and mechanical work defined from the stochastic thermodynamics .",
    "the two entropy production rates become one in the absence of velocity - dependent external force , which will be studied in sec .",
    "v. then , a novel decomposition of entropy production rate is formulated in terms of probability fluxes in the phase space ( eq .",
    "( [ decom_epr ] ) ) , and the leading orders of thermodynamic quantities in the limit of small inertia are calculated .",
    "we find that one term in the decomposition converges to the entropy production rate of the corresponding overdamped dynamics ( eq .",
    "( [ eqrspatial ] ) ) ; while the anomalous entropy production rate originates from the other term ( eq .",
    "( [ eqrano ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , such a recently reported anomalous entropy production rate is also closely related to the steady - state flux of kinetic energy along the spatial coordinate ( eq . ( [ 333 ] ) ) .",
    "the meaning of time reversibility in physics , also known as the principle of microscopic reversibility @xcite , is actually two folds : the forward trajectory @xmath0 and its time - reversed one @xmath1 are both the solutions of a same deterministic microscopic equations of motion , or the statistical descriptions of the forward and backward processes are exactly the same @xcite . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "it is formulated in the second sense , and is equivalent to the principle of detailed balance @xcite .    in the present letter",
    ", we aim to study the general second - order stochastic differential equation in @xmath2dimension describing the motion of a brownian particle @xmath3 which could be further rewritten as @xmath4 on the phase space , where @xmath5 represents gaussian white noise with position - dependent intensity @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the mass of the particle .",
    "the time - reversibility of such a stochastic system should be formulated through the transition probabilities @xcite , i.e. @xmath8 for any positions @xmath9 , velocities @xmath10 and time @xmath11 .",
    "it follows that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the initial distribution and @xmath14 is the transition probability density function .",
    "the time evolution of the function @xmath15 obeys both the kolmogorov forward and backward equations : @xmath16    then we can apply the backward equation ( [ kolmo_backward ] ) for @xmath17 to derive the time evolution of function @xmath18 i.e. @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21/\\rho_0(\\bm{x}_2,-\\bm{v}_2).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the definition of time - reversibility ( eq .",
    "( [ time_reversibility ] ) ) , @xmath22 , which satisfies ( [ kolmo_forward ] ) . comparing ( [ kolmo_forward ] ) and ( [ 111 ] ) , we can get the necessary and sufficient condition for time - reversibility @xmath23    define another function @xmath24 , which reverses all the odd variables including @xmath25 in the function @xmath26 under the time reversal transformation , then the necessary and sufficient condition ( [ condition1 ] ) for time reversibility can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath27.\\label{condition2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the lower subequation in ( [ condition2 ] ) guarantees that the distribution @xmath28 is just the unique stationary solution @xmath29 to the well - known fokker - planck equation of the probability distribution @xmath30 in the phase space @xmath31 where the coordinate flux @xmath32 and the velocity flux @xmath33 . hence at steady state , time - reversibility is only equivalent to the upper subequation in ( [ condition2 ] ) , just replacing @xmath28 with the unique stationary solution @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , the time reversibility of second - order stochastic system at steady state also corresponds to certain symmetry of the probability fluxes in the phase space : the spatial fluxes are odd while the velocity fluxes are even with respect to all the odd variables including @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath34 it could be regarded as * the condition of detailed balance*. in steady state , it is equivalent to the condition of time - reversibility ( just the upper subequation in ( [ condition2 ] ) )",
    ". it is quite different from that of the overdamped langevin dynamics @xcite , where all the fluxes vanish at time - reversibility .",
    "it is generally believed that time - reversibility of the statistical description for the stochastic process , or the detailed balance , is equivalent to the thermodynamic equilibrium , which has already been proved for chemical kinetics as well as overdamped dynamics @xcite . however , that might not be the case for the second - order stochastic dynamics . in case that there is certain velocity - dependent external force as a feedback control in addition to the frictional force",
    ", the application of overdamped approximation is totally invalid and the relation between time - reversibility and thermodynamic equilibrium has not been clear yet .    indeed , a lot of forces @xmath35 could satisfy the time - reversibility condition ( [ condition2 ] ) for certain given steady - state probability density @xmath29 .",
    "it is because once we have a well defined density function @xmath29 , then we could find an odd and an even function @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are the solutions of the following equations that are derived from ( [ condition2 ] ) @xmath38 the solution @xmath39 is not even generally unique , since we can add any magnetic term @xmath40 to @xmath39 in which @xmath41 is also odd under time reversal .",
    "then @xmath42 would make the second - order stochastic process ( [ langevin_eq ] ) become time - reversible .",
    "the simplest example in which time - reversibility is not equivalent to thermodynamic equilibrium is when the velocity - dependent external force is linear , i.e. @xmath43 with certain positive constant @xmath44 . in this specific example",
    ", we assume that the diffusion coefficient as well as temperature is not position - dependent . due to the einstein relation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the uniform temperature of the heat reservoir .",
    "hence the corresponding stationary distribution becomes @xmath47 $ ] with the effective temperature @xmath48 .",
    "the condition ( [ condition2 ] ) of time - reversibility is always satisfied in this example for all @xmath49 .",
    "however , the effective temperature @xmath48 is less than the temperature @xmath46 of the heat reservoir unless @xmath50 , which implies that it is not at thermal equilibrium with the reservoir .",
    "such a nonequilibrium phenomenon has already been successfully used to reduce the thermal fluctuations of a cantilever in atomic force microscopy(afm ) through feedback control @xcite , in which the force between the sharp tip at the end of the cantilever and the target surface obeys the hooke s law and there is an external agent detecting the velocity of the cantilever and performing the feedback .",
    "another nontrivial example is when @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", we can set @xmath52 and any function @xmath39 satisfying @xmath53 then the second - order stochastic process ( [ langevin_eq ] ) with @xmath42 would be time - reversible .",
    "one solution of @xmath39 is @xmath54    thus the condition of time - reversibility is only a necessary condition for thermodynamic equilibrium , because it alone could not be sufficient to guarantee the well - known maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xcite in terms of the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "we regard the equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann distribution as the second condition for thermodynamic equilibrium beyond time - reversibility for underdamped stochastic processes .",
    "this distribution @xmath55 could be further rewritten as @xmath56 in which the temperature @xmath46 of the reservoir should be position - independent .",
    "on the other hand , if the steady - state distribution of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp1 ] ) is in the maxwell - boltzmann type , i.e. @xmath57 , then the total force @xmath58 where @xmath59 must satisfy @xmath60 . in order to make such a stochastic process be time - reversible , according to the condition ( [ condition2 ] )",
    ", we must further require the @xmath61 to be invariant under the inversion of velocity , e.g. when @xmath61 is the lorentz force .",
    "therefore , a steady state is at thermodynamic equilibrium if and only if both ( [ condition2 ] ) and ( [ condition3 ] ) are satisfied , i.e. @xmath62    the second equality implies that , at thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath35 could be naturally decomposed into an odd term @xmath63 and an even term @xmath64 .",
    "the unique odd term is a frictional force @xmath65 with @xmath66 , which is indeed the einstein relation .",
    "hence in the following , we rewrite the force @xmath35 as @xmath67 , in which @xmath68 is regarded as the external force and we assume the local einstein relation holds , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the case that the temperature at each instantaneous position of the corresponding particle is imposed just by the heat reservoir @xcite , i.e. just replacing @xmath46 with @xmath70 in the langevin dynamics regardless with other complications @xcite .",
    "also we donot explicitly exclude the potential force from the external force @xmath68 , since such a convention would not affect any of the results below .",
    "the problem of defining entropy production rate for underdamped stochastic processes has still not completely determined yet .",
    "recently , a general definition of entropy production rate through comparison of the probabilities of the original path @xmath71 with respect to its time - reversed counterpart @xmath72 has been put forward and already applied to stochastic systems with odd and even variables @xcite .",
    "such an entropy production rate is expressed as @xmath73 ^ 2\\rho_t d\\bm{x}d\\bm{v}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the entropy production rate @xmath74 is nonnegative . according to the upper subequation in ( [ condition2 ] ) , @xmath75 is equivalent to the time - reversibility of the second - order stochastic system ( [ langevin_eq ] ) provided that it is already in steady state .    on the other hand , people have also defined another entropy production rate @xcite @xmath76 ^ 2\\rho_t d\\bm{x}d\\bm{v}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this second entropy production rate @xmath77 is nonnegative and @xmath78 is equivalent to the condition of maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( [ condition3 ] ) , which is usually not a consequence of ( [ condition2 ] ) as stated in sec .",
    "an equilibrium state has to satisfy both of them , i.e. @xmath78 together with @xmath75 .",
    "such an entropy production rate @xmath77 is originally defined from the entropy balance equation @xcite @xmath79 where the entropy of the stochastic system in the whole phase space @xmath80 and the two additional terms",
    "@xmath81 @xmath82    the first additional term @xmath83 characterizes whether there is any velocity - dependent external force as feedback control on the system .",
    "it vanishes for any probability distribution @xmath84 on the phase space if and only if the external force @xmath85 is independent of the velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the second additional term @xmath86 can be further rewritten in terms of the spatial heat dissipation density @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88    it is because in stochastic thermodynamics the dissipated heat into the heat bath could be defined as @xcite @xmath89    and the work @xmath90 done by the external force @xmath68 is @xmath91 in which @xmath92 is the spatial density of work done upon the system at position @xmath93 .",
    "the products in the definition of heat and work along trajectory are both in the stratonovich type .",
    "it is because only the stratonovich type has the typical chain rule , which is needed for the validity of the first law .",
    "furthermore , the spatial density of kinetic energy at position @xmath93 is @xmath94 , whose evolution involves the local densities of heat and work as well as the flow of kinetic energy along the spatial coordinate .",
    "thus the energy conservation at position @xmath93 becomes @xmath95 in which @xmath96 is the spatial flux of kinetic energy . in steady state ,",
    "@xmath97 , which immediately implies the total @xmath98 .",
    "when thermodynamic equilibrium is reached , the spatial densities of heat dissipation and work as well as the spatial flux of kinetic energy all vanish .",
    "for instance , in the steady state of the process ( [ langevin_eq ] ) when @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xcite . when @xmath44 is positive , @xmath103 and the total heat dissipation @xmath104 , which indicates that the heat flows from the reservoir to the internal system and then is released to the external agent in the form of mechanical work , sustaining such a nonequilibrium steady state @xcite .",
    "it is because the mechanical work done by the extrnal force @xmath105 is always negative , which must be balanced by the heat input into the internal system .",
    "when @xmath106 where the external force @xmath107 is only dependent on position , the two entropy production rates @xmath74 and @xmath77 become one .    in this case , the condition of time reversibility ( [ condition2 ] ) is already equivalent to thermodynamic equilibrium , and could be simply rewritten as @xmath108    the upper subequation guarantees the equilibrium distribution to be at the form of @xmath109 .",
    "then the lower subequation further requires @xmath110 to be hold for any coordinates @xmath93 and @xmath25 .",
    "hence both the coefficients in front of @xmath25 and @xmath111 have to vanish .",
    "therefore ( [ eq19 ] ) holds if and only if the external force @xmath107 associates with a potential and the temperature profile @xmath70 imposed from the heat reservoir is independent of @xmath93 .",
    "in such an equilibrium case , the fokker - planck equation of langevin dynamics is already known as the kramers equation , which takes the maxwell - boltzmann distribution as the corresponding equilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "as we already know , the velocity flux @xmath112 can be decomposed into an irreversible term @xmath113 and a reversible term @xmath114 @xcite",
    ". then @xmath115 could be regarded as the _ thermodynamic force _ associated with the irreversible velocity flux @xmath116 .",
    "hence the entropy production rate is just the average of the conditional second moment of @xmath117 at given position , i.e. @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the second moment of @xmath117 given @xmath93 , and @xmath120 is the marginal distribution of the spatial coordinate .",
    "we notice the fact that @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the mean and @xmath123 is the variance of @xmath117 at any given position @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath124 is the integrated spatial fluxes @xmath125",
    ".    then we can decompose the entropy production rate into two nonnegative terms @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the spatial entropy production rate only regarding the integrated spatial flux , and @xmath128      in order to investigate the thermodynamic behavior in the limit of small inertia , we need to decompose the right - hand - side operator of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp1 ] ) into two terms , i.e.    @xmath129\\rho_t,\\ ] ] in which @xmath130 and @xmath131    denote @xmath132 as the locally approximated maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath133 , and a projection operator @xmath134 is defined as @xmath135    then borrowing the operator method in @xcite , we can get the limiting equation satisfied by @xmath136 as @xmath137 and the residual term @xmath138    using the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath139 , we can get that in the limit of small inertia , @xmath140 would satisfy the corresponding smoluchowski equation @xcite : @xmath141 in which the overdamped spatial flux @xmath142 $ ] . note that the frictional coefficient in the correct smoluchowski equation , also known as fokker - planck equation , should be formulated in the anti - ito form @xcite .",
    "we can further get the leading order for the residual term , and finally get @xmath143.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{app_dist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq .",
    "( [ app_dist ] ) implies the integrated spatial flux @xmath124 of the second - order stochastic system converges to the overdamped spatial flux @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , @xmath145 which is just the entropy production rate defined for the overdamped dynamics associated with ( [ fokker - planck - smol])@xcite .",
