    "in the standard model ( sm ) the higgs boson serves for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry and the generation of the fundamental particle masses @xcite .",

    "both the atlas and cms collaborations announced the discovery of a new boson , whose properties are relatively close to the long awaited sm higgs boson with mass of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the higgs boson , the main task of further experiments is to determine its properties . particularly , the precise determination of the higgs boson couplings is imperative for verifying the validity of the sm and the existence of new physics at high energy scale",
    ".    the lhc first runs at @xmath6 and @xmath7 are completed , and the latest data from them show that all the properties @xcite of the new boson measured so far are well consistent with that of the sm higgs boson , but it is well known that there are some theoretical difficulties associated with the sm higgs sector .",
    "for example , the famous hierarchy problem , which is associated with the quadratic radiative corrections to the sm higgs mass , is one of the difficulties , and there is no way to solve this problem in the sm .",
    "so new physics effects are still expected to solve these difficulties .",
    "there are many model candidates of new physics predicting sizeable deviations from the the higgs couplings in the sm . in the sm some higgs couplings of the types",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are absent at the tree - level , and they would be particularly sensitive to new physics @xcite . with the increases of the lhc luminosity and colliding energy , we can collect statistically enough events for most of the important multi - body production processes . obviously",
    ", precision measurements require accurate theoretical predictions for both signal and background . in the last few years",
    ", the phenomenological results including the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the higgs boson production associated with di - gauge - boson at the lhc , such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , have been studied @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 production at the lhc also offers the possibility to directly investigate the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 anomalous higgs gauge couplings @xcite , as they would cause deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "moreover , an accurate estimate of the @xmath0 process followed with subsequent higgs and @xmath2-boson decays could provide the direct observable predictions in searching for possible new physics . with the transverse momentum and rapidity cuts of @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the final photon ,",
    "the cross section for the @xmath4 production at the @xmath18 lhc is about @xmath19 , and therefore only about @xmath20 integrated luminosity is required to produce about 1000 events .    in this paper",
    ", we make a precision calculation for the @xmath0 process at the lhc including the nlo qcd corrections with on - shell higgs and @xmath2-boson decays in the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) , but do not provide the detailed strategy to extract the information of the anomalous higgs gauge couplings from the @xmath21 process . in section ii we give the description of the analytical calculations for the lo cross section and the nlo qcd radiative corrections to the @xmath0 process . in section",
    "iii we present some numerical results and discussions . finally , a short summary is given .",
    "in this section we describe the analytical calculations at the lo and qcd nlo for the @xmath22 process .    in our calculations we employ feynarts 3.4 package @xcite to generate lo and qcd nlo feynman diagrams and their corresponding amplitudes .",
    "the algebraic manipulations on the amplitudes are implemented by applying formcalc 5.4 programs @xcite .",
    "we neglect the masses of @xmath23- , @xmath24- , @xmath25- , @xmath26-quarks . due to the smalless of ( anti)bottom - quark density in proton , the lo contribution to the cross section from the @xmath27 process at the @xmath18 lhc is less than @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we do not consider the partonic process of @xmath29 annihilation in our calculations .",
    "then the contributions to the cross section for the parent process @xmath0 come from the following partonic processes , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 represent the four - momenta of the incoming partons and the outgoing @xmath36 , @xmath2 and photon , respectively .",
    "the lo feynman diagrams for the partonic process @xmath37 are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "since the yukawa coupling strength is proportional to fermion mass and the @xmath23- , @xmath24- , @xmath25- , @xmath26-quarks are considered as massless , there is no contribution from the feynman diagrams with internal higgs boson line and the higgs emission from initial quark .",
    "the lo amplitude for the @xmath37 partonic process involves qed soft and collinear ir singualrities since the photon is radiated from massless quark . to avoid these qed ir singularities and obtain an ir - safe lo result",
    ", we take the transverse momentum and rapidity cuts on the final photon ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) as declared in the following section .",

    "the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath0 process are constituted distinctly by the following three parts : ( 1 ) the virtual correction , ( 2 ) the real gluon and light-(anti)quark emission corrections , ( 3 ) the collinear counterterms of the pdfs .",
    "the virtual nlo qcd correction to the @xmath37 partonic process consists of self - energy , vertex , box and counterterm diagrams .",
    "the one - loop feynman diagrams are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we follow the definitions of tensor and scalar one - loop integral functions in refs.@xcite , and use the passarino - veltman ( pv ) method @xcite to reduce tensor integrals to the linear combinations of tensor structures and coefficients , where the tensor structures depend on the external momenta and the metric tensor , while the coefficients depend on scalar integrals and kinematic invariants",

    "after the reduction for tensor integrals , the amplitude for loop corrections involving one - loop scalar integrals contains both uv and ir divergences .",
    "the uv divergence is vanished after performing the renormalization procedure .",
    "but the total qcd nlo amplitude for the subprocess @xmath37 still contains qcd soft / collinear ir singularities .",
    "we adopt the expressions in ref.@xcite to deal with the qcd ir divergences in feynman integrals , and apply the expressions in refs.@xcite to implement the numerical evaluations for the qcd ir - finite parts of @xmath73-point scalar integrals . according to the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem @xcite ,",
    "these ir singularities will be cancelled by adding the contributions of the real gluon / light-(anti)quark emission subprocesses , and redefining the pdfs at the qcd nlo .    since we put the transverse momentum , rapidity cuts on the final photon and a resolution cut on the photon and final jet throughout our lo and qcd nlo calculations , the numerical results for the real gluon / light-(anti)quark emission subprocesses are qed ir safe . while the real gluon / light - quark emission processes contain the qcd soft and collinear ir singularities .",
