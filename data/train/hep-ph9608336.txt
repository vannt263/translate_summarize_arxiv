    "field theoretic models of cosmological inflation are generically required to provide a very flat potential for the ` inflaton ' field , the large and approximately constant vacuum energy of which drives an exponential increase of the scale - factor and is then converted to radiation when the inflaton settles into its global minimum @xcite . in building such a model care must be taken to avoid the hierarchy problem which arises because the fundamental interactions , in particular gravity , will communicate any such high scale of new physics to all sectors of the theory , driving the electroweak breaking scale far above its observed value .",
    "the only known way to avoid this problem is through the introduction of supersymmetry which can protect the low energy scales from such radiative corrections to all orders @xcite . the local version of supersymmetry  supergravity",
    " incorporates gravity and has therefore been extensively studied in attempts to construct a unified description of all the fundamental interactions , the most ambitious of which is the superstring .",
    "however supergravity inflationary models @xcite suffer from their own ` hierarchy ' problem .",
    "the large cosmological constant during inflation breaks supersymmetry , giving all scalar fields a soft mass of order the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "the resulting curvature of the inflaton potential is typically too large to allow a sufficiently long period of inflation to occur @xcite .",
    "there have been many suggested solutions to this problem but most of them are deemed to be ad - hoc or unworkable @xcite ( although inflation driven by a d- term @xcite may be viable ) . in continuation of this discussion and our previous work @xcite , we wish to propose a new mechanism leading to successful inflation in the low - energy effective supergravity theory following from the superstring .",
    "we demonstrate that in a wide class of such theories , the equations of motion have an infra - red fixed point at which successful inflation can occur , even for minimal kinetic terms , along a f - flat direction",
    ". moreover the resulting inflationary potential has a very specific structure , allowing precise predictions for the generated perturbations  both scalar and tensor .",
    "we compute these in detail for a cold - dark matter dominated critical density universe , including non - linear evolutionary effects , and compare with the results of the apm galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "we find reasonable agreement with the data without having to invoke a component of hot dark matter .",
    "the expected power spectrum of the angular anistotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is also calculated using a boltzmann code and normalized to the cobe observations @xcite on large angular scales .",
    "ongoing and future observations on small angular scales @xcite will thus provide a definitive test of the model .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the necessary ingredients for successful inflation with a scalar potential @xmath0 . essentially all model generating an exponential increase of the cosmological scale - factor @xmath1 satisfy the ` slow - roll ' conditions @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hubble parameter during inflation , and the normalized planck mass @xmath4 gev .",
    "inflation ends ( i.e. @xmath5 drops through zero ) when @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the epoch at which a scale of wavenumber @xmath8 crosses the ` horizon ' @xmath9 ( more correctly , hubble radius ) during inflation , i.e. when @xmath10 .",
    "the cmb anisotropy measured by cobe @xcite allows a determination of the fluctuation amplitude at the scale , @xmath11mpc , corresponding roughly to the size of the presently observable universe , where @xmath12kmsec@xmath13mpc@xmath13 is the present hubble parameter . the number of e - folds before the end of inflation when this scale crosses the hubble radius is @xmath14 where we have indicated the numerical values anticipated for the various energy scales in our model . ( note that @xmath15 is smaller than the usually quoted @xcite value of 62 because the reheat temperature _ must _ be low enough to suppress the production of unstable gravitinos which can disrupt primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite",
    ". ) the cobe observations sample cmb multipoles upto @xmath16 , where the @xmath17 multipole probes scales around @xmath18 .",
    "the low multipoles , in particular the quadrupole , are entirely due to the sachs - wolfe effect on super - horizon scales ( @xmath19mpc ) at cmb decoupling and thus a direct measure of the primordial perturbations",
    ". however the high multipoles are ( increasingly ) sensitive to the composition of the dark matter which determines how the primordial spectrum is modified through the growth of the perturbations on scales smaller than the horizon at the epoch of matter - radiation equality , i.e. for @xmath20mpc .",
    "thus the normalisation of the spectrum ( [ deltah ] ) to the cobe data is sensitive to its @xmath8 dependence and also on whether there is a contribution from gravitational waves to the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the 4-year cobe data is fitted by a scale - free spectrum , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with @xmath23k @xcite . for a scale - invariant ( @xmath24 ) spectrum , @xmath25k , so assuming that there are no gravitational waves , the amplitude for a @xmath26 cdm universe is @xmath27 @xcite . using eq.([deltah ] ) , the vacuum energy at this epoch is then given by @xmath28 showing that the inflationary scale is far below the planck scale @xcite . a similar limit obtains , viz .",
    "@xmath29 , if the observed anisotropy is instead ascribed entirely to gravitational waves , the amplitude of which , in ratio to the scalar perturbations , is just @xcite @xmath30 thus it is legitimate to study inflation in the context of an effective field theory",
    ". we will consider the class of models in which the evolution of the inflaton potential is dominated by a _",
    "single _ power at the point where the observed density fluctuations are produced , as is the case in all of the supergravity models so far considered .",
    "the potential then has the form @xmath31\\ .\\ ] ] in the usual model of chaotic inflation @xcite , one has @xmath32 so the first term on the rhs is negligible and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are small because they are proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the alternative possibility @xcite is for @xmath36 to have an initial vacuum expectation value ( vev ) much smaller than the planck scale during inflation , in which case the smallness of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and hence @xmath33 and @xmath34 , results from the relative smallness of the second term on the rhs .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a general formalism capable of describing both cases by expanding the ( slowly varying ) potential about the value @xmath39 in inflaton field space at which the observed density fluctuations are produced . writing @xmath40 ( in units of @xmath41 ) we have @xmath42\\",
    ".    \\label{expand}\\ ] ] here we have factored out the overall scale of inflation @xmath43 , which we have seen must be small relative to the planck scale @xmath41 .",
    "the constraints on the parameters in the potential following from the slow - roll conditions ( [ slowroll ] ) are therefore @xmath44 we now examine whether these conditions can be naturally satisfied in supergravity theories .",
    "in supersymmetric theories with a single supersymmetry generator ( @xmath45 ) , complex scalar fields are the lowest components , @xmath46 , of chiral superfields @xmath47 which contain chiral fermions , @xmath48 , as their other component .",
    "( we will take @xmath47 to be left - handed chiral superfields so that @xmath48 are left - handed fermions . )",
    "masses for fields will be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking so that the only fundamental mass scale is the planck scale , @xmath41 .",
    "( this is aesthetically attractive and also what follows if the underlying theory generating the effective low - energy supergravity theory follows from the superstring . )",
    "the @xmath45 supergravity theory describing the interaction of the chiral superfields is specified by the khler potential @xmath49 which yields the scalar potential @xmath50   + { \\rm d - terms}\\ , \\label{v}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 here the function @xmath52 sets the form of the kinetic energy terms of the theory @xmath53 while the superpotential @xmath54 determines the non - gauge interactions of the theory . for canonical kinetic energy terms , @xmath55 ,",
    "the potential takes the relatively simple form @xmath56 . \\label{pot}\\ ] ] in order for there to be a period of inflation , it is necessary for at least one of the terms @xmath57 to be _ non - zero_. however , these are precisely the order parameters for supersymmetry so this corresponds to supersymmetry breaking during inflation .",
    "while there are several possible mechanisms for such breaking , it suffices for the purposes of this discussion to simply assume that one of the terms has nonvanishing value @xmath58 , where @xmath43 denotes the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "now expansion of the exponential in eq.([pot ] ) shows that @xmath59 and @xmath60 in eq.([expand ] ) , in conflict with the requirements for successful inflation ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the problem arises due to the presence of the overall factor involving the exponential in the potential ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "the same structure typically occurs even for more general kinetic terms ( see eq.[v ] ) and it is this that has led to the conclusion that inflation is difficult to achieve within the context of supergravity .    in ref.@xcite we suggested that in theories with moduli the problem is easily avoided .",
    "moduli are fields in superstring theories which , in the absence of supersymmetry breaking , have no potential .",
    "the moduli vevs serve to determine the fundamental coulings of the theory and for the moduli of interest here they appear in the superpotential only in combination with non - moduli fields , serving to determine the latter s couplings in terms of their vevs .",
    "we argued earlier that the quadratic terms in the potential involving the non - moduli fields such as the inflaton would be absent for special values of these vevs and , since the resultant potential would drive inflation , just this desired configuration would come to dominate the final state of the universe @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that it is not even necessary to invoke such an ` anthropic principle ' because there is a _ quasi - fixed point _ in the evolution of the moduli .",
    "this ensures , for initial values in the basin of attraction of the fixed point , that the cancellation of the quadratic terms applies , ensuring that condition ( [ bound ] ) is satisfied .",
    "although the moduli have a flat potential in the absence of supersymmetry breaking , once supersymmetry is broken they may acquire a potential through the moduli dependence of the @xmath52 function in the scalar potential ( [ v ] ) .",
    "this is potentially disastrous for the mechanism discussed above because such a potential would drive the moduli vevs away from the value needed to cancel the quadratic inflaton term .",
    "however the kinetic term often has a larger symmetry than the full lagrangian ; for example the canonical form has an @xmath61 symmetry where @xmath62 is the total number of chiral fields . in this case",
    "there will be many moduli left massless even when supersymmetry is broken because they will be ( pseudo ) goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry .",
    "these moduli can play the role discussed above eliminating the quadratic term in the inflaton potential .",
    "the mechanism we propose applies to a large class of models , the only condition being that the kinetic term does indeed have a symmetry leading to pseudo - goldstone modes .",
    "however it is instructive to construct a definite model to illustrate the idea in detail .",
    "consider a simple case with just two moduli @xmath63 .",
    "the canonical kinetic term has @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "this clearly has an @xmath66 symmetry . since moduli are not determined before supersymmetry breaking , they may have planck scale vevs so it is not sufficient to keep only the lowest order ( canonical ) terms .",
    "thus we generalize the @xmath67 kinetic term , allowing for a general functional dependence on @xmath68 , so @xmath69 , which preserves the @xmath66 symmetry . when supersymmetry breaking is switched on",
    ", the moduli will develop a potential which fixes the vev @xmath70 of @xmath68 at a minimum of @xmath71 but leaves the ratio of the vevs of @xmath72 to @xmath73 undetermined .",
    "we now introduce a chiral matter multiplet @xmath36 which will contain the inflaton . unlike the moduli it may have couplings in the superpotential which can keep it in thermal equilibrium at temperatures below the planck scale .",
    "( for example a superpotential of the form @xmath74 will generate a term @xmath75 in the effective potential at high temperature , which would force @xmath76 . )",
    "although such an initial condition is not essential to our argument , it does simplify the discussion , so we take the initial conditions , at a temperature @xmath77 , the scale of the putative inflationary potential , to be @xmath78 , @xmath79 . using this we expand the @xmath36 dependence of the kinetic function @xmath52 keeping only the low - order terms : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an unknown function and",
    "@xmath82 is a constant .",
    "the last term on the rhs above involves only chiral or antichiral fields separately and can be absorbed in the superpotential . in writing this term",
    "we have assumed there is an @xmath83 symmetry under which @xmath72 and @xmath36 have opposite charges while @xmath73 is a singlet .",
    "thus the larger @xmath66 symmetry of the kinetic term is broken by interactions , the gauge interactions and couplings in the superpotential . the third term on the rhs above leads , via eq.([v ] ) , to a term in the potential proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "this is the first term sensitive to the ratio of the vevs of @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "consider now the potential following from this kinetic function .",
    "one combination of the moduli will be driven rapidly to a minimum of @xmath85 due to the term @xmath86 .",
    "writing @xmath87{\\rm e}^{i\\theta_i/\\langle\\nu_i\\rangle}$ ] , the combination @xmath88 is seen to acquire a mass of @xmath89 through this term , while the other three components ( pseudo - goldstone modes ) remain massless . in studying the inflationary possiblities of the potential we are only interested in `` slow '' modes , viz . those fields with masses much less than @xmath90 which satisfy the inflationary constraints ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "thus we will henceforth ignore the `` fast '' mode @xmath67 .",
    "we turn now to the second and third terms of eq.([ninf ] ) . setting @xmath68 to its vev @xmath70 , we have for the fields involving @xmath36 @xmath91\\ , \\label{dp}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and we have expanded @xmath36 about the point @xmath93 as @xmath94{\\rm e}^{i\\theta_\\phi/\\langle\\phi\\rangle}$ ] , @xmath95 . expanding the exponent in eq.([v ] ) now yields the leading potential term for @xmath36 of the form @xmath96 .",
    "the important point is that for specific values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the term proportional to @xmath99 in eq.([dp ] ) may _ vanish _ , offering the possibility of a potential for @xmath100 which satisfies eq.([bound ] ) .",
    "we will expand eq.([dp ] ) in the neighbourhood of this point and show that for a large range of initial values the fields will be driven to values such that inflation does occur .",
    "consider first the possible slow modes of relevance to an inflationary era .",
    "these are @xmath101 and the non-@xmath67 component of @xmath102 and @xmath103 . on the other hand",
    "the phase @xmath104 is a fast field because , for the small @xmath93 of interest here , it is dominated by the last term and has a large mass .",
    "this is readily seen by expanding the cosine in the potential leading to the term v@xmath105 ^ 2 $ ] , with a piece unsuppressed by the small vev @xmath93 .",
    "thus the phase @xmath106 will flow rapidly to the minimum @xmath107 .",
    "having identified the fast and slow variables , we now expand the potential in the latter only , about the vev @xmath108 for which the quadratic term in @xmath109 vanishes , i.e. for @xmath110 satisfying @xmath111 .",
    "this gives @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the slow component of @xmath114 in the neighbourhood of the expansion point and @xmath115 is a constant of order unity .",
    "we wish to study the evolution of these fields for a range of initial conditions . for this",
    "we need to know the equation of motion , which in turn requires the form of the kinetic terms following from eq.([kin ] ) . for small @xmath93 , the dominant term in @xmath52 giving the @xmath116 kinetic energy",
    "is just @xmath117 , as the @xmath36 kinetic energy term is canonical .",
    "( note that this applies even though the quadratic @xmath118 term in the potential has been cancelled .",
    "the reason is that the term responsible for the cancellation in the potential is a @xmath119 term in @xmath52 and this does not affect the kinetic term at all !",
    "this is the underlying mechanism that evades the problems highlighted in ref.@xcite . ) for small oscillations in @xmath113 , the kinetic function can also be expanded with leading term , @xmath120 , giving canonical kinetic energy for this field too .",
    "thus the equations of motion for @xmath101 and @xmath113 are both of the canonical form .",
    "the example presented above assumes that the kinetic term has a larger symmetry than the full lagrangian .",
    "however it is straightforward to construct other examples in which the potential discussed above follows from a symmetry of the full theory .",
    "we illustrate this in a model with a single modulus field , @xmath67 , by the choice of kinetic function @xmath121 + \\ldots    \\label{ninf1}\\ ] ] here we have written the most general form of @xmath52 up to terms quadratic in @xmath36 , consistent with a @xmath122 symmetry under which @xmath36 is odd , and a @xmath83 @xmath123-symmetry under which @xmath67 transforms non - trivially as @xmath124 and the superspace co - ordinates transform as @xmath125 . in this case , the pseudo - goldstone modes associated with the first two terms of eq.([ninf1 ] ) are the phases of @xmath67 and @xmath36 .",
    "the latter is a fast variable but the former is a slow variable and generates a @xmath99 term in the potential via @xmath126\\rightarrow -|\\kappa|\\lambda^4|\\phi|^2[(\\ln|\\nu|)^2 + \\case{\\theta_\\nu^2}{\\langle|\\nu|^2\\rangle}]^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "here we have allowed the fast variable to determine the overall sign of the term as before . again",
    "a choice of the phase , @xmath127 , will cancel the @xmath99 term and expanding about this point leads to the same potential as above .",
    "we hope these two examples have illustrated how the cancellation of the quadratic term can occur in a wide class of models .",
    "now we consider the evolution of the fields for various initial conditions .",
    "the field potential is of the form @xmath128 where we have added further terms in the expansion of @xmath129 .",
    "the cubic term may arise from a cubic term in the superpotential @xcite ; this is allowed by the symmetries we have been discussing if the additional ( @xmath83 ) symmetry of the @xmath36 field in an @xmath123-symmetry .",
    "( alternatively there may be another modulus with @xmath83 charge such that a cubic term can appear in the kinetic function @xmath52 . )",
    "if the cubic term is not present , then the quartic term , which is always allowed in the kinetic term by the @xmath66 and @xmath83 symmetries of the model , will dominate .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath115 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are all naturally of order unity .",
    "( the parameter @xmath115 may be chosen to be positive by definition while the parameter @xmath130 should be negative if it is to lead to an inflationary potential . )",
    "we are interested in initial conditions which lead , through thermal effects or otherwise , to @xmath101 being small but there is nothing which constrains the initial conditions of @xmath113 .",
    "however we note that the potential ( [ vf ] ) has an infrared fixed point with @xmath132 . consequently",
    ", any initial value of @xmath116 and @xmath113 will be driven there if they are within the domain of attraction , given ( for positive @xmath115 ) by @xmath133 |\\tilde{\\phi}|\\ .\\ ] ] therefore , _ without any fine tuning of the initial conditions _ ( beyond the condition that the fields lie in this domain of attraction ) , the fields are driven to fixed values and the potential becomes a constant , driving a period of inflation .",
    "this fixed point corresponds to a point of inflection in the potential which is unstable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "thus inflation is naturally terminated by a mechanism which we believe has not been discussed earlier .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath113 and @xmath101 are @xmath134 so while @xmath113 is positive , the fields are driven to the fixed point and inflation begins .",
    "however if @xmath113 should fluctuate and become negative the fields will be driven away from the fixed point thus ending inflation .",
    "( for @xmath115 negative , the reverse would be the case . )",
    "now the fluctuations of @xmath113 are of order the hawking temperature of the de sitter vacuum , @xmath135 , thus once @xmath113 is driven ( from the positive direction ) to be of @xmath136 , fluctuations will lead to it becoming negative and end inflation .",
    "the initial conditions for this stage are @xmath137 ; thereafter , as we see from eq.([em ] ) , @xmath101 will grow more rapidly than @xmath113 and the cubic term in the potential will soon dominate .    we have argued that the potential of the form ( [ vf ] ) arises naturally in supergravity models with moduli such as may be expected from the superstring .",
    "there are two distinctive features of this potential which ensure that , after the transition to positive @xmath113 , there will be an inflationary period yielding density fluctuations of the magnitude observed .",
    "the first is that this potential has a very small gradient in the neighbourhood of the origin in field space so it generates a long period of slow - roll inflation during which quantum fluctuations are naturally small .",
    "the second feature is that the full potential , including higher order terms , is governed by an overall scale , @xmath43 .",
    "the reason is that the potential arises from the @xmath52 term of eq.([g ] ) which , in the absence of supersymmetry breaking , gives rise to the kinetic term and thus does not contribute to the potential , vanishing when derivatives are set to zero .",
    "thus the potential is proportional to the ( fourth power of the ) overall supersymmetry breaking scale , @xmath43 .",
    "this scale is expected to be of @xmath138gev @xcite and , in conjunction with the small slope , correctly yields the required magnitude of density fluctuations .",
    "the inflationary period following from a potential of the form ( [ vf ] ) with no quadratic term ( and @xmath139 ) has been closely studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the field value when perturbations of a given scale cross the hubble radius is obtained by integrating the equation of motion ( [ em ] ) back from the end of inflation , which occurs at @xmath140 when @xmath141 . thus @xmath142 $ ] and using eq.([nstar ] ) we find a logarithmic ( squared ) deviation from scale invariance for the scalar perturbations , @xmath143^{4}\\ .",
    "\\label{spec}\\ ] ] this corresponds to a ` tilted ' spectrum , @xmath144 , with @xmath145 i.e. @xmath146 for @xmath147 corresponding to the scales probed by cobe @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that a leading cubic term in the potential gives the @xmath148 departure from scale - invariance .",
    "the slope of the potential is tiny , @xmath149 , but its curvature is not : @xmath150 .",
    "consequently , although the spectrum is tilted , the gravitational wave background ( [ grav ] ) is _",
    "negligible_. furthermore the tilt would be greater if @xmath151 is smaller , for example if there is a second epoch of ` thermal inflation ' when the scale - factor inflates by @xmath16 e - folds @xcite so that the value of @xmath151 appropriate to cobe is 31 rather than 51 , and @xmath152 .",
    "we normalize the spectrum ( [ spec ] ) to the cmb anisotropy using the expression for the ( ensemble - averaged ) quadrupole @xcite , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the second - order spherical bessel function . according to the cobe data @xcite , @xmath155k for @xmath156 which fixes the inflationary scale to be @xmath157 consistent with general considerations of supersymmetry breaking _ during _ inflation @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the ( dimensionless ) rms mass fluctuations after matter domination ( per unit logarithmic interval of @xmath8 ) is given by @xcite @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the usual power spectrum and the ` transfer function ' @xmath160 takes into account that linear perturbations grow at different rates depending on the relation between their wavelengths , the jeans length and the hubble radius .",

    "however , observational uncertainties still permit the hubble parameter to be as low as 0.4 @xcite and the nucleon density parameter @xmath169 may be as high as @xmath170 , taking into account the recent upward revision of the @xmath171he mass fraction @xcite .",

    "( we have not allowed for the evolution of clustering in the apm data which is estimated to systematically raise the data points by @xmath174 for an unbiased @xmath26 cdm universe @xcite . )",
    "we have shown the data separately for the 4 zones of the apm survey to illustrate that there are large errors @xcite for @xmath175 ; thus the apparent discrepancy here requires further investigation @xcite .",

    ". other studies of tilted spectra @xcite focussed on the linear evolution and/or used a compendium @xcite of data from different surveys ( having different systematic biases ) rather than one set of high quality data .",
    "we conclude that the problem with the excess power on small scales in the cobe - normalized standard cdm model @xcite is naturally alleviated in supergravity inflation , as anticipated earlier @xcite , with _ no need for a component of hot dark matter_.    we also quote some averaged quantities of observational interest for this model .",
