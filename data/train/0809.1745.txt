    "a good astronomical site is characterised by various atmospheric conditions ( which includes atmospheric transparency , seeing , meteorological parameters such as wind , snowfall , surface temperature , rainfall etc . and sky brightness ) and geographical conditions ( such as local topography , seismicity , source availability i.e , latitude etc . ) .",
    "sites having minimum cloud coverage , very low frequency of snowfall / rainfall , low relative humidity , low nocturnal temperature variation , high atmospheric transparency and low night sky brightness are good for ground based optical and infrared observations .",
    "two main characteristics of the night sky are the night sky brightness and atmospheric extinction .    even in the absence of artificial light ,",
    "the moonless night sky is not dark .",
    "this is because the atmosphere scatters into the sky , light emitted by the following processes ( cf .",
    "krisciunas 1997 ) , ( i ) zodiacal light ( caused by sunlight scattered off interplanetary dust ) , ( ii ) faint unresolved stars and diffuse galactic light due to atomic processes within our galaxy , ( iii ) diffuse extragalactic light ( due to distant , faint unresolved galaxies ) and ( iv ) airglow and aurorae ( produced by photochemical reactions in the earth s upper atmosphere ) . of these , ( i)@xmath1(iii ) are extraterrestrial in origin and thus independent of the site , whereas ( iv ) depends on the site and time of observation .",
    "these are the natural processes which produce the night sky brightness in any astronomical site .",
    "in addition to the above , night sky can be affected by light pollution due to scattering of street lights in the earth s lower atmosphere .",
    "humans do not have control on any of the natural sources causing the brightness of the night sky , but do have a control on the brightness caused by artificial lights scattered on to the sky .",
    "it is thus possible to maintain the night sky brightness at any observatory site to its natural level by minimising light pollution in the immediate vicinity of the observatory .",
    "apart from the natural and artificial sources affecting the night sky , the light coming from any celestial source being observed suffers from scattering by air molecules and aerosols as well as absorption by water vapour and ozone while passing through the earth s atmosphere .",
    "this leads to attenuation of their light and is referred to as the atmospheric extinction .",
    "this depends on the constituents of the atmosphere , the wavelength of the incoming light , and the altitude of the site .",
    "precise knowledge of the extinction coefficient of each site is essential to compare observations of the same object taken from different locations of the globe .",
    "a good astronomical site needs low extinction values .",
    "apart from low extinction , its stability during a night is also equally important . in this article",
    "we present the moonless night sky brightness and atmospheric extinction in @xmath0 passbands at iao , hanle .",
    "iao is located at the himalayan range in northern india ( longitude = 78@xmath957@xmath1051.2@xmath11 e , latitude = 32@xmath946@xmath1046.5@xmath11 n and altitude = 4467 m ) and run by the indian institute of astrophysics , bangalore .",
    "this is a thinly populated , cold and dry desert region .",
    "the sky at iao is thus not much affected by dust and light pollution due to human activities . a 2 m telescope , the himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) is operational at iao since may 2003 .",
    "the data used in this study for night sky brightness span the period 2003@xmath12008 which correspond to a major part of the declining phase of solar activity ( which could affect night sky brightness ) cycle-23 , while the data for extinction estimates span the period 2000@xmath12008 .",
    "preliminary estimates of the night sky brightness and extinction at iao have been reported by parihar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and an analysis of the meteorological parameters at iao is presented in stalin et al .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the data set used in this study , section 3 presents the analysis of extinction and section 4 presents an analysis of night sky brightness . a spectrum of the night sky at iao is presented in section 5 and the results are summarized in the final section .",
    "no data were obtained specifically for studying the night sky at iao .",
    "therefore , archives at iao were searched for a data set which is as homogeneous as possible . multiband imaging data from the supernova monitoring program of iao were thus collected from the archives spanning the years 2003@xmath12008 .",
    "they were from science observations carried out using hfosc at the 2 m hct .",
    "the ccd used in these observations was a 2k @xmath12 4k , with a pixel scale of 0.296@xmath11/pix giving a sky coverage of 10 @xmath12 10 arcmin@xmath13 .",
    "a total of 210 images obtained over 47 nights were extracted from the iao archives and used to estimate the night sky brightness .",
    "photometric standard fields ( landolt 1992 ) observed over several nights during 2000@xmath12008 were used to estimate the site extinction .",
    "a 1k @xmath12 1k ccd system was in use during 2000@xmath12002 , while the hfosc was used since 2003 february .",
    "the data used for extinction estimates thus comprise of a total of 1325 image frames in the @xmath0 bands obtained over 58 nights , covering an airmass range of 1.01 @xmath1 2.40 .",
    "pre - processing of all the photometric data as well as photometry have been done using iraf .",
    "the night sky spectrum at iao has been extracted from the spectroscopic data of supernova sn 2004et obtained on 2004 october 16 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a 11@xmath10 long and 1.92@xmath11 wide slit and two grisms ; grism 7 and grism 8 covering the wavelength range from 3500@xmath17000   and 5200@xmath19200   respectively .",
    "the spectral resolution is 8  .",
    "spectroscopic data too , was bias subtracted , flux and wavelength calibrated using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the bouguer s linear formula for atmospheric extinction is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the observed magnitude , @xmath16 is the magnitude above the earth s atmosphere , @xmath17 is the extinction and secz is the airmass at zenith distance z.    the three sources of extinction in the earth s atmosphere that are important for ground based astronomical photometry are ( hayes & latham 1975 )    1 .",
    "@xmath18 = aerosol scattering 2 .",
    "@xmath19 = rayleigh scattering by molecules 3 .",
    "@xmath20 = molecular absorption mainly by ozone    the contribution of each of these parameters to extinction depends on wavelength , whereas , rayleigh and aerosol scattering , apart from wavelength , depend also on height and atmospheric conditions at the site .",
    "according to hayes & latham ( 1975 ) , rayleigh scattering by air molecules at an altitude @xmath21 is given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23    here , @xmath24 is the wavelength in microns and @xmath21 is the altitude in km .",
    "eq.2 assumes an atmospheric pressure of 760 torr at @xmath21 = 0 and a scale height of 7.996 km .",
    "the largest uncertainty here is due to the deviation of local atmospheric pressure from the assumed standard condition .",
    "molecular absorption by ozone and water vapour too contribute to the total extinction at any site .",
    "ozone is concentrated at altitudes between 10 and 35 km and hence its contribution to the extinction does not depend on the altitude of the observatory .",
    "however , it is a function of wavelength and occurs in selective bands centered at @xmath25 3300 and 5750   ( gutierrez - moreno et al . 1982 ) .",
    "on the other hand , extinction due to water vapour is difficult to estimate , because the amount of water vapour above a site is variable .",
    "this is however , weak and centered only around a few select bands with neglible contribution to broad band .",
    "the extinction due to ozone is ( cf .",
    "bessel 1990 ; kumar et al .",
    "2000 )    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the ozone absorption coefficient and is given as    @xmath28    extinction due to aerosol scattering is highly variable .",
    "this is due to particulates including mineral dust , salt particles and man made pollutants and is expressed as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the density scale height for aerosols and @xmath31 is the total optical thickness of atmospheric aerosols for @xmath24 = 1 @xmath32 , which depends on the total content of particles and on their efficiency for scattering and absorption and is taken to be 0.087 ( mohan et al . 1999 ; bessel 1990 ) .",
    "@xmath33 is a parameter which depends on the size of the aerosol grains . following hayes & latham ( 1975 ) a value of @xmath30 = 1.5 km and @xmath33 = 0.8",
    "is considered in this work . the largest uncertainty in @xmath18 from eq .",
    "5 , is due to the incomplete knowledge of the nature of aerosols at the location of iao .",
    "the total extinction at any given wavelength is therefore a linear combination of these three contributions and is given as    @xmath34    from hfosc images , the extinction coefficients in different filters were determined using eq .",
    "the observed values at @xmath35 and @xmath8 filters and the theoretical values calculated at their central wavelengths are given in table 1 .",
    "the observed values of extinction coefficients have a mean value of 0.36 @xmath3 0.07 , 0.21 @xmath3 0.04 , 0.12 @xmath3 0.04 , 0.09 @xmath3 0.04 and 0.05 @xmath3 0.03 in @xmath0 bands respectively .",
    "a histogram of the measured extinction coefficients is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the monthly variation of extinction determined for the period 2000@xmath12008",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 . from fig .",
    "2 it is seen that the extinction in summer months is larger than during the winter months . here , summer months refer to the period between may@xmath1september and winter months refer to the period between october@xmath1april .",
    "the variation of the measured extinction coefficients with the average night time wind speed is shown in fig . 3 for all the bands .",
    "3 , there is a hint for a correlation between the extinction coefficient and the wind speed .",
    "but , non - inclusion of one high extinction value at high wind speed in each band removes the correlation ( linear correlation coefficient r @xmath36 0.5 ) and the linear fit shown in fig .",
    "3 almost becomes horizontal .",
    "thus , from the present data set , there is no clear evidence of a correlation between the extinction coefficient and the average night time wind speed .",
    "further data are needed to check for the presence or absence of this correlation .",
    "a statistical summary of the measured extinction data is given in table 2 .",
    "the yearly averages of extinction coefficient in several bands are given in table 3 .",
    "as evident from table 3 , we find no clear evolution of extinction over the years 2000@xmath12008 .",
    "aerosol extinction properties can be studied from the observed total extinction .",
    "the observed values of mean extinction were analysed to study the nature of aerosols at iao .",
    "it has been noted by hayes & latham ( 1975 ) that the extinction due to rayleigh and ozone can be calculated theoretically with an accuracy of the order of @xmath30.01 mag / airmass for wavelengths between 3300 @xmath1 10800  , using eqs . 2 and 3 .",
    "therefore , from the total measured extinction , theoretically calculated values of extinction due to rayleigh scattering and ozone were subtracted to get the observed values of extinction due to aerosols .",
    "thus the extinction due to aerosols at iao is estimated as follows    @xmath37    the deduced values of aerosols using eq .",
    "7 could well be represented as @xmath38    @xmath33 and @xmath39 in eq .",
    "8 , were then determined by linear fits on the log - log plots of the deduced aerosol extinction and wavelength .",
    "we find a mean value of @xmath33 = 0.84 @xmath3 0.23 and @xmath39 = 0.07 @xmath3 0.04 from analysis of 14 nights for which a linear fitting was possible .",
    "the mean value of @xmath33 found here is similar to that found for many observatories ( hayes & latham 1975 ) .",
    "a comparison of the extinction at hanle with that of other sites is given in table 4 . from table 4",
    "it is seen that the extinction at iao is similar to that of the best astronomical sites",

    "are similar to those of other dark sites in the world .",
    "the bright nature of the sky in @xmath8 band at iao , might be due to the presence of strong oh rotation vibrational meinel bands in the red region of the optical spectrum .",
    "we find no dependence of the night sky brightness with 10.7 cm solar flux , probably due to insufficient data coverage during the solar cycle .",
    "3 .   the moonless night sky spectrum covering the wavelength range 3000 to 9300 has been presented . features from oi , oh , na and n are seen in the spectra . lines due to light pollution are not seen in the spectrum , and thus hanle is free from any man made light pollution .    we conclude that iao has a night sky similar to the best sites in the world .",
    "in addition to the good skies , iao also has a longitudinal advantage in covering the longitudinal gap between observatories in the west and the east .",
