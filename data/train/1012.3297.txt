    "quantum pure states can be faithfully described by their wavefunction @xmath0 . experimentally producing and measuring pure quantum states is impossible due to the imperfections both of the generation procedures and the measurement apparata . in particular quantum states of the optical fields",
    "are always mixed due to impossibility of transmitting and detecting optical fields with 100% efficiencies .",
    "density matrix @xmath1 formalism encopasses the possibility of describing both pure and mixed state . in this context",
    "an important parameter is represented by the purity @xmath2 given by the trace of the squared density matrix operator with @xmath3 for pure states while @xmath4 for mixed ones .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 assumes a relevant role in quantum information protocols @xcite , where the fidelity , _ i.e. _ the rate of success , depends critically on the purity of the states .",
    "@xmath5 also can give a quantitative measure of the decoherence the pure state have suffered .",
    "pure states satisfy the schrdinger @xcite and robertson rob29 basic inequalities that generalize heisenberg @xcite uncertainty relations including contributions from covariance of conjugate quantum observables . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) a new bound , higher than the schrdinger - robertson , which accounts for the contribution of the purity of mixed states was found . in ref .",
    "uncertaintyasl the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation was expressed in terms of homodyne tomograms .",
    "the generic tomographic approach to quantum systems was reviewed in @xcite . combining the purity dependent bound and",
    "its expression in terms of homodyne tomograms give rise to a method for a simple determination of the state purity via homodyne detection developed in raymer , mlynek , lvovski , solimeno , bellini , raymerrmp .",
    "the problem of measuring the position and momentum was discussed also in connection with the tomographic approach recently in @xcite .",
    "so far , evaluation of purity in continuous variable ( cv ) systems is obtained once the full state density matrix have been reconstructed by quantum tomographic methods . in this paper",
    "we prove that the purity of the analyzed state can be retrieved by a very simple and fast analysis of homodyne data thus giving the possibility of having an on - line monitor on the state .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold . on the one hand",
    "we express the purity @xmath5 of a mixed state in terms of homodyne tomograms , _",
    "i.e. _ quantities amenable to an experimental determination . on the other hand , relying on the uncertainty relations of ref .",
    "@xcite we derive a simple estimator for the purity of a thermal state which is independent from its tomographic expression .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a probability representation of quantum mechanics was suggested in which states are described by standard probability distributions , called tomograms .",
    "this representation is based on the representation of the wigner function @xmath6 of a quantum state by means of the radon integral transform or marginal distributions ( optical tomograms ) @xcite .",
    "these data representing the output of optical homodyne detectors allows reconstructing the wigner function using the experimental data .",
    "this tomography procedure is nowadays a routine method for measuring quantum states ( see for a review raymerrmp , parisspringer ) . in the present paper , using ideas discussed in @xcite , we apply the optical tomography to check generalized schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relations for conjugate quadratures in the case of a mixed quantum state , in particular , for measuring the effective temperature of a state . the idea of our consideration is based on suggestion @xcite ( see , also @xcite ) that the homodyne tomogram is a primary object identified with the quantum state . due to this , one can extract all information on the state properties including the purity from the measured tomogram only , avoiding the reconstruction of the wigner function procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section 2 , starting from the symplectic forms we give an expression of the purity parameter and of the mean photon number of any mixed photon state in terms of measurable optical tomograms . for thermal states",
    "this expression provides the temperature of the field and the mean photon number thus suggesting to check the accuracy of homodyne detection by comparing photon statistics obtained in this way , i.e. , from optical tomograms , and in independent photon counting experiment .",
    "in section 3 , we review mixed state uncertainty relations to get an estimation of the purity independent of its tomographic expression , by saturating the bound set by the uncertainty relation found in dodonov183 .",
    "hence , measuring optical tomograms of photon states , we can evaluate the purity of the state , and , in the case of thermal states , study the dependence of the quantum bound on the field temperature , thus obtaining a sort of a thermometer for evaluating the temperature .",
    "also , we obtain an estimation for the mean photon number .",
    "finally , in section 4 , an experimental comparison , for thermal states , is performed between our estimation and an independent measure of purity of the state , which allows for evaluating the accuracy of our approximate estimation .",
    "a quantum state , either mixed or pure , is described by a density operator @xmath7 with purity parameter @xmath5  given by:@xmath8 \\leq 1\\ .\\]]according to @xcite the state is described by a symplectic tomogram @xmath9 where @xmath10  are real parameters , obtained by the radon transform of the wigner function @xmath11 ( hereafter@xmath12):@xmath13 \\text { , } \\    \\label{b}\\]]with @xmath14 standing for @xmath15accordingly the generalized quadrature operator @xmath16 depends parametrically on @xmath17 and its moments are given by : @xmath18like means and variances , in terms of homodyne quadrature statistics .",

    "moreover , comparing the last expression with the thermal state purity given in eq .",
    "( [ purth ] ) it is easy to see that:@xmath71 the above expression of the uncertainty function @xmath64 in terms of tomograms was given in @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of the function @xmath64 is the following . for a local oscillator phase @xmath68 , it is the determinant of the quadrature dispersion matrix , shifted by @xmath72 as shown in eq .",
    "( s - r ) . for a nonzero local oscillator phase @xmath57",
    ", the function @xmath63 corresponds to the determinant of the dispersion matrix of the quadratures , which are measured in a rotated reference frame in the quadrature phase space .",
    "the non - negativity of the function @xmath73 implies the fulfilling of the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation for all the unitarily equivalent position and momentum operators , since the unitary transformations do not change the canonical commutation relations . the formula ( [ f(theta ) ] ) simply expresses the determinant of the dispersion matrix for unitarily rotated position and momentum , in terms of tomographic probability distribution @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the tomogram must satisfy the inequality ( [ mandodgen ] ) , or ( mandod ) , where the parameter @xmath5 is expressed in tomographic terms by eq .",
    "( [ optpur ] ) .",
    "however , we can get an estimation of the purity in terms of the tomographic uncertainty function @xmath64 by saturating the inequality ( [ mandod ] ) .",
    "in other words , we consider the minimum value @xmath75 of the uncertainty function @xmath64 and estimate that for such a value the inequality is pretty near saturated . then , by solving with respect to @xmath5 , we are able to express the purity as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "this is a simple expression : @xmath76whose plot is shown in fig . [ plotpur ] .     the minimum value of @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath75 saturates the inequality ( [ mandod ] ) . ]    as one can see , @xmath78 corresponds to a pure state , @xmath79 , and the purity is a smooth decreasing function , going to zero for @xmath75 at infinity .    on the other hand , for thermal states the purity parameter",
    "is directly related to the temperature , i.e. @xmath80 , so that the previous inequalities and estimations can be translated in terms of temperature .",
    "so , in particular , for a thermal state the bound @xmath81 in inequality ( [ mandod ] ) can be written in terms of the temperature @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 provides the temperature @xmath82 of a thermal state with the corresponding purity @xmath83 .",
    "we get@xmath84 ^{-1}\\approx \\left [ 2\\tanh ^{-1}\\left ( \\frac{2\\sqrt{1 + 4f}}{2 + 9f}\\right ) \\right ] ^{-1}\\ .",

    "finally , we remark that for a thermal state the mean value of the photon number can be expressed as a function of the temperature as @xmath86so we have a relation between our estimation of the temperature @xmath82 and the photon statistics .    in other words",
    ", we may check the accuracy of our estimation of the purity and the temperature , resulting from inequality ( [ mandod ] ) , by comparing our estimation of @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88with an independent measure of the mean number of photons .",
    "this comparison is discussed in the next section .",
    "we conclude this section by observing that if the state is not thermal , but we succeed in finding the value @xmath75 saturating the uncertainty inequality to introduce an effective temperature @xmath89 this effective temperature is again given by the right hand side of eq .",

    "moreover , @xmath64 allows to evaluate @xmath5 , the state purity ( eq . ( [ purapprox ] ) ) , and in the case of thermal state , @xmath40 , the field temperature ( eq . ( [ toff ] ) ) , and @xmath30 , the mean photon number ( eq . ( [ noff ] ) ) .",
    "thermal states are gaussian so for these states also eq . ( [ purth ] )",
    "thus , in order to asses the reliability of the proposed method , it is possible to compare the estimations of @xmath5 via @xmath91 with the same quantity obtained by using eq .",

    "first we prove that the state is gaussian by performing some tests to assess the gaussianity of data distribution @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have used the kurtosis excess ( or fisher s index ) and the shapiro - wilk indicator .",
    "the kurtosis is a measure of the `` peakedness '' of the probability distribution of a real - valued random variable while the shapiro - wilk one tests the null hypothesis that a distribution @xmath95 came from a normally distributed population .",
