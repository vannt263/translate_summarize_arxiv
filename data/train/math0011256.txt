    "constructing a hyperkhler metric on the total space @xmath0 of the cotangent bundle to a khler manifold @xmath1 is an old problem , dating back to the very first examples of hyperkhler metrics given by e. calabi in @xcite .",
    "since then , many people have obtained a lot of important results valid for manifolds @xmath1 in this or that particular class ( see , for example , the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the general problem has been more or less solved a couple of years ago , independently by b. feix @xcite and by the author @xcite .",
    "the metrics constructed in @xcite and @xcite are the same .",
    "in fact , this metric satisfies an additional condition which makes it essentially unique  which justifies the use of the term `` canonical metric '' .",
    "but the approaches in @xcite and @xcite are very different .",
    "feix s method is very geometric in nature ; it is based on a direct description of the associated twistor space .",
    "the approach in @xcite is much farther from geometric intuition .",
    "however , it seems to be more likely to lead to explicit formulas .",
    "unfortunately , the paper @xcite is 100 pages long , and it is not written very well .",
    "some of the proofs are not at all easy to understand and to check .",
    "the exposition is sometimes canonical to the point of obscurity .",
    "recently the author has been invited to give a talk on the results of @xcite at the second quaternionic meeting in rome .",
    "it was a good opportunity to revisit the subject and to streamline and simplify some of the proofs .",
    "this paper , written for the proceedings volume of the rome conference , is an attempt to present the results of @xcite in a concrete and readable form .",
    "the exposition is parallel to @xcite but the paper is mostly independent .",
    "compared to @xcite , the emphasis in the present paper has been shifted from canonical but abstract constructions to things more explicit and down - to - earth .",
    "the number of definitions is reduced to the necessary minimum .",
    "i have also tried to give a concrete geometric interpretation to everything that admits such an interpretation . in a sense",
    ", the exposition as compared to @xcite intentionally goes to the other extreme .",
    "thus the present paper is not so much a replacement for @xcite but rather a companion paper  the same story told in a different way .",
    "i should note that the canonical hyperkhler metric on @xmath0 has one important defect ",
    "namely , it is defined only in an open neighborhood @xmath2 of the zero section @xmath3 .",
    "this raises a very interesting and difficult `` convergence problem '' .",
    "one would like to describe the maximal open subset @xmath4 where the canonical metric is defined , and to say when @xmath5 is the whole total space @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known about this .",
    "in fact , in the present paper we even restrict ourselves to giving the formal germ of the canonical metric near @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that this formal germ converges to an actual metric at least on an open subset @xmath2 is proved in the last section of @xcite .",
    "the proof is long and tedious but completely straightforward .",
    "since i do not know how to improve it , i have decided to omit it altogether to save space .",
    "this reader will find the precise statements of all the results in section  [ deffs ] .",
    "the last part of that section contains a brief description of the rest of the paper , and indicates the parallel places in @xcite , the differences in notation and terminology and so on .",
    "the only thing in this paper which is completely new is the last section  [ symmm ] .",
    "it contains an explicit formula for the canonical metric ( or rather , for the canonical hypercomplex structure ) in the case when @xmath1 is an hermitian symmetric space .",
    "the formula is similar to the general formula for symmetric @xmath1 obtained by o. biquard and p. gauduchon in @xcite .",
    "* acknowledgments .",
    "* i would like to thank the organizers of the rome quaternionic meeting for inviting me to this very interesting conference and for giving me an opportunity to present the results of @xcite .",
    "part of the present work was done during my visit to ecole polytechnique in paris during the autumn of 1999 .",
    "i have benefited a lot from the hospitality and the stimulating atmosphere of this institution .",
    "i would like to thank p. gauduchon for inviting me to paris and for encouraging me to write up a streamlined version of @xcite .",
    "the present paper owes a lot to discussions with o. biquard and p. gauduchon during my visit .",

    "applying lemma  [ j.matrix ] , we see that all we have to prove is the equality @xmath663 . by lemma  [ rj ]",
