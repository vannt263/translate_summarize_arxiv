    "stellar mass compact binaries consisting of double neutron stars ( ns ) , double black holes ( bh ) or a mixed binary consisting of a neutron star and a black hole , are the primary targets for a direct first detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) by interferometric detectors , ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo600 @xcite , and tama  @xcite . under radiation reaction",
    "the orbit of a binary slowly decays , emitting a signal whose amplitude and frequency increases with time and is termed a `` chirp '' signal .",
    "while it is believed that there is a greater population of ns - ns binaries @xcite , it is the bh - bh binaries that are the strongest candidates for detection since they can be seen from a greater volume , about two orders - of - magnitude greater than ns - ns binaries @xcite .      in order to detect such sources",
    "one employs the method of matched filtering  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the method works as follows : firstly , one creates a set of waveforms , or templates as they are called , that depend on a number of parameters of the source and its location and orientation relative to the detector .",
    "these templates are then cross - correlated with the detector output weighted by the inverse of the noise spectral density . if a signal , whose parameters are close to one of the template waveforms , is actually present in the detector output then the cross - correlation builds up , with the dominant contribution coming from frequencies where the noise spectral density is low .",
    "thus , in the presence of a sufficiently strong signal the correlation will be much larger than the rms correlation in the absence of any signal . how large should it be before we can be confident about the presence of a signal depends on the combination of the rate of inspiral events and the false alarm probability ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a simple estimation ) .",
    "the effectiveness of matched filtering depends on how well the phase evolution of the waveform is known .",
    "even tiny instantaneous differences , as low as one part in @xmath10 in the phase of the true signal that might be present in the detector output and the template that is used to dig it out could lead to a cumulative difference of several radians since one integrates over several hundreds to several thousands of cycles . in view of improving the signal - to - noise ratio for inspiral events there has been a world - wide effort in accurately computing the dynamics of a compact binary and the waveform it emits or to use phenomenologically defined detection template families @xcite .",
    "there have been parallel efforts on using two different approximation schemes : on the one hand the post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion of einstein s equations has been used to treat the dynamics of two bodies of comparable masses with and without spin , in orbit around each other .",
    "this approximation is applicable when the velocities involved in the system are small but there is no restriction on the ratio of the masses @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "black hole perturbation theory has been used to compute the dynamics of a test particle in orbit around a spin - less or spinning black hole .",
    "black hole perturbation theory does not make any assumptions on the velocity of the components , but is valid only in the limit when the mass of one of the bodies is much less than the other @xcite .",
    "the post - newtonian approximation is a perturbative method which expands the equations of motion , binding energy and gw flux as a power series in @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a typical velocity in the system and @xmath13 is the speed of light . in the early stages of an inspiral ,",
    "the radiation reaction time - scale @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angular velocity and @xmath16 its time - derivative , is much greater than the orbital time - scale @xmath17 .",
    "it is during this adiabatic regime that the post - newtonian approximation works best . at present , the pn expansion for the case of comparable - masses is known to order @xmath18",
    "@xcite and @xmath19  @xcite , for the energy and flux functions , respectively",
    ". however , at this order an arbitrary parameter exists in the expression for the flux . in order to see",
    "how well pn theory performs , we can compare two different systems .",
    "if we assume a ns - ns binary of masses ( 1.4,1.4 )  @xmath20 and a lower frequency cutoff of the detector at 40 hz , then the  orbital velocity \" of the binary is small , @xmath21 , ] when it enters the detector bandwidth and the two stars are still largely separated , @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio of time - scales in the most sensitive regime of the detector is in the range @xmath23 .",
    "if on the other hand we take a bh - bh binary of masses ( 10,10)@xmath20 , the orbital velocity is quite large , @xmath24 and the separation is quite small , @xmath25 upon entering the detector bandwidth .",
    "this is very close to the regime , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where the background curvature becomes strong and the motion relativistic .",
    "once again , comparing time - scales , we obtain @xmath28 , where the final value is taken at the last stable orbit at @xmath29 hz",
    ". it is known that pn theory becomes inaccurate at an orbital separation of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "therefore , post - newtonian approximation becomes less valid for higher mass systems in the ligo band but well describes the early stages of the inspiral of a ns - ns system visible in ligo .",
    "as previously stated , black hole perturbation theory makes no assumptions about the orbital velocity of the components , but does restrict their masses .",
    "one assumes that a test particle of mass @xmath31 is in orbit about a central bh of mass @xmath32 such that @xmath33 . assuming this restriction",
    "is satisfied we have an analytical expression for the energy .",
    "however , no analytical expression has been worked out for the gravitational wave flux emitted by such a system .",
    "using black hole perturbation theory , a series approximation was initially calculated to @xmath34 by poisson for a test particle in circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole  @xcite .",
    "the series was extended numerically to @xmath35 by cutler et al .",
    "@xcite , and then to @xmath36 by tagoshi and nakamura  @xcite and confirmed analytically by tagoshi and sasaki  @xcite .",
    "the most recent progress is an extension of the series to @xmath37 by tagoshi , tanaka and sasaki  @xcite . for a test particle in circular orbit about a kerr black hole ,",
    "the initial progress was again made by poisson  @xcite .",
    "the series approximation was improved from @xmath38 to @xmath35 , and subsequently to @xmath39 by tagoshi , tanaka , shibata and sasaki  @xcite .",
    "several authors @xcite have shown that the convergence of both post - newtonian approximation and black hole perturbation theory is too slow to be useful in constructing accurate templates .",
    "more recently , damour , iyer and sathyaprakash ( hereafter dis ) showed for the case of a test - mass in orbit about a schwarzschild bh , that by using properly defined energy and flux functions that have better analytical properties , combined with pad techniques , it was possible to take the existing series expansion and improve its convergence properties  @xcite .",
    "the new approximation in which pad approximants of new energy and flux functions are used to derive improved templates is called p - approximant . using a fiducially defined `` exact '' waveform",
    ", it was shown that the p - approximant templates were both more _ effectual _",
    "( i.e. larger overlaps with the exact waveform ) and _ faithful _",
    "( i.e. larger overlaps with the exact waveform and lower biases in the estimation of parameters ) than the corresponding post - newtonian ( hereafter t - approximant ) templates . while in general , more templates are needed for p - approximant templates to cover the same volume of parameter space  @xcite , the extra computational cost is preferred for the increased performance in p - approximants .",
    "the failure of the pn expansion to converge sufficiently quickly in the case of a test particle orbiting a schwarzschild bh  @xcite does not bode well for the modelling of even a test particle inspiralling into a kerr bh .",
    "another motivation for this work is that at present there is effort to use _ effective one body _ ( eob ) waveforms  @xcite to detect the inspiral and merger signals from two comparable - mass kerr bhs in gw data .",
    "as the eob waveforms are based partially on p - approximants , any development and concretization of the benefits of p - approximant templates will boost our confidence in using these improved waveforms as detection templates .      in this paper we will extend the p - approximant technique to the case of a test particle orbiting a kerr black hole .",
    "the reason for focusing on test - mass systems is that we can use the exact numerical fluxes @xcite from black hole perturbation theory with which to compare our results and thereby reliably demonstrate the usefulness of the technique .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : waveform ] with a summary of the matched filtering and the signal - to - noise ratio achieved by the first generation of geo , ligo and virgo interferometers for spinning black hole binaries .",
    "we then go on to discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : energyandflux ] the current state - of - the - art in our understanding of the evolution of a test particle in orbit around a kerr black hole .",
    "in particular , we shall discuss the time - evolution of the orbital energy and gravitational wave flux as a function of the spin of the central black hole at various post - newtonian orders , and the locations of the last stable and unstable circular orbits .",
    "we shall see that the post - newtonian expansion of the flux does not show a regular behaviour as we move from low to high orders in the post - newtonian expansion , becoming worse for more rapidly spinning black holes . in order to improve the convergence properties of the flux function , in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxmodel ] we shall introduce a modified form of the flux function and its pad approximant .",
    "we shall demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the improved behaviour of the pad approximant , at first graphically and then by showing that the overlaps , of the inspiral waveform based on it with the exact waveform , are close to unity .",
    "we shall use a number of different test systems in our comparison : these will range from systems with dissimilar masses , such as a ns - bh binary , to comparable - mass systems , such as a bh - bh binary . to deal with the comparable mass systems , we shall introduce in the energy and flux functions a term dependent on the symmetric mass ratio @xmath40 while not being entirely consistent , because of the fact that no finite mass correction terms are included , it allows us to examine the performance of various templates as we move from the test - mass systems to comparable - mass systems .",
    "the emphasis of the current paper is also on the estimation of parameters .",
    "we have carried out a detailed study of how good t- and p - approximants are in measuring the parameters of the binary .",
    "we shall show in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] that as a result of not being _ effectual _ representations of the exact signal , t - approximants also turn out not to be _ faithful _",
    "representations either . in other words ,",
    "the systematic error in the estimation of the parameters caused by the wrong phasing of the signal is much larger in the case of t - approximants than in the case of p - approximants . in summary ,",
    "p - approximants are not only _ effectual _ but they are _ faithful _ too as in the case of non - spinning black hole binaries .",
    "in this section we will discuss the nature of the post - newtonian waveform from an inpiralling compact binary and the response of an antenna to such a signal .",

    "however , the effective one - body approach @xcite has allowed a treatment of the radiation damping to proceed beyond the adiabatic approximation . in order to extract an inspiral signal that may be buried in noisy data by the method of matched filtering ,",

    "clearly , systems with large spins in which the test mass is in prograde orbit produce the highest snrs since their last stable orbit frequency is higher than those of retrograde orbits and they last longer . to capture such signals , however , one must know the phasing of the waves very well since the bodies spend a substantial fraction of their time in the detector band in the strongly non - linear regime of the evolution",
    ". we shall show later in this paper that there could be a significant drop in the snr , and a corresponding drop in the number of candidate events that can be detected , while p - approximants lose little snr and therefore capture almost all events .",
    "we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : timevsv ] ) and ( [ eq : phivsv ] ) that the phase of the gravitational wave depends both on the energy and flux functions of the binary system . in the test - mass case , that is",
    "when one of the masses is far smaller than the other ( @xmath140 ) so that the dynamics is governed entirely by the kerr geometry of the massive body , we have an exact expression for the energy @xmath141 , but only a series representation for the flux @xmath142 . in the comparable - mass case ,",
    "wherein one can not neglect the perturbation caused by the companion , both functions are represented only by post - newtonian expansion .",
    "the standard approximants for @xmath143 and @xmath144 are simply their successive taylor approximants @xmath145 and @xmath146 respectively .",
    "the gravitational wave signal constructed using these taylor approximants are called t - approximant signals or waveforms are simply t - approximants .    it was shown in ref  @xcite that the convergence properties of both the energy and flux functions can be improved by using pad approximation of well - defined energy and flux functions .",
    "damour , iyer and sathyaprakash followed a two - pronged approach to construct improved energy and flux functions @xcite : starting from the more basic energy - type and flux - type functions , @xmath147 and @xmath148 ref .",
    "@xcite constructs pad - type approximants , say @xmath149 , @xmath150 , of the `` basic '' functions @xmath147 , @xmath151 one can then compute the required energy and flux functions entering the phasing formula . the successive approximants @xmath152 $ ] and @xmath153 $ ] have better convergence properties than their taylor counterparts @xmath154 $ ] and @xmath155 $ ] .    in this study",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the test mass approximation and , therefore , employ the exact energy function .",
    "however , in the same approximation the flux function has been computed analytically only as a taylor series although numerically the flux has been computed exactly . since our aim is to draw conclusions on how effective p - approximants are in the comparable mass case , wherein one has only a taylor expansion of the flux , we construct p - approximants of flux and compare it with the numerical results .",
    "the reasons for constructing a new flux function are the following : firstly , it is well known , in the schwarzschild case , that a simple pole exists at @xmath156  @xcite in the expression for the flux . we might , therefore , expect that a similar pole exists in the kerr case . a taylor approximant of the flux function will never produce a pole while the equivalent pad approximant , which is essentially a rational polynomial , will have a pole .",
    "although it is well known that pad approximants have the ability to model functions which are subject to singularities  @xcite it is not guaranteed that the rational polynomial will reproduce the exact pole .",
    "secondly , it is often possible to recover from the _ divergence _   of a taylor series by using pad approximation .",
    "again , one can not be certain that the resulting pad approximant , even when it converges , will be closer to being exact than any of the taylor approximants , but experience with the test mass approximation in the schwarzschild case render some optimism to this expectation .",
    "we create a pad approximation of a truncated power series of an analytic function containing @xmath157 terms by equating it to a rational function such that the rational function when expanded as a power series and truncated to order @xmath157 coincides with the original power series .",
    "more precisely , pad approximation can be thought of as an operator @xmath158 that acts on a polynomial @xmath159 to define a rational function : @xmath160{\\frac{\\displaystyle # 1}{\\displaystyle # 2 } } p^{n}_{m } \\left ( \\sum_{k=0}^{n } a_{k}v^{k } \\right ) = \\dfrac{\\sum_{k=0}^{n } a_{k}\\,v^{k}}{\\\\   1+\\sum_{k=1}^{m } b_{k}\\,v^{k } } , \\label{eq : pade}\\ ] ] such that the number @xmath161 of coefficients in the rational polynomial on the right hand side is the same as the number @xmath162 of taylor coefficients on the left hand side . by setting @xmath163 with @xmath164",
    "we can define two types of pad approximants : these are the super - diagonal , @xmath165 , and sub - diagonal , @xmath166 , approximants . normally , the sub - diagonal approximants are preferred over super - diagonal approximants .",
    "this is because when @xmath167 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pade ] ) can be re - expanded as a continued fraction which have the property that as we go to each new order of the power series only one new coefficient needs to be calculated .",
    "conversely , with the super - diagonal approximants , we would have to re - calculate all the @xmath168 s and @xmath169 s in the above equation as we go to higher orders in the taylor expansion .",
    "this means that the sub - diagonal pad approximants are more _ stable _ and if we see a trend of convergence in the coefficients the addition of a term is not likely to spoil this convergence .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  [ sec : padeapp ] for a more summary of the properties of pad approximations and how to find the diagonal pad coefficients using continued fraction expansion .      in the case of both schwarzschild and kerr black holes we have an exact expression for the orbital energy of a test particle in a circular orbit around the parent black hole .",
    "for a black hole of mass @xmath32 the energy @xmath170 in terms of the dimensionless magnitude of velocity @xmath171 @xmath172 being is the radial coordinate in the boyer - lindquist coordinates , takes the form  @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath0 is a dimensionless spin parameter given in terms of the spin angular momentum @xmath174 of the black hole by @xmath175 with @xmath176 spin angular momentum per unit mass in the kerr metric .",
    "it is actually the derivative of the orbital energy that appears in the phasing formula given by : @xmath177 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the velocity parameter @xmath12 .    for black holes with spin , the positions of the last stable circular orbit",
    "is a function of the spin parameter @xmath0 . in order to find the position of the last stable circular orbit we take @xmath178 which gives  @xcite : @xmath179\\,\\left [ 3 + z_{1}(q ) + 2\\,z_{2}(q ) \\right]}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath180\\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ z_{2}(q ) & = & \\sqrt{3\\,q^2 + z_{1}^{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath181 @xmath182 sign on @xmath183 corresponds to prograde ( retrograde ) orbits . now",
    "the position of the last unstable circular orbit or `` photon ring '' occurs where the energy function exhibits a pole .",
    "thus , the photon orbit is found by solving a cubic equation .",
    "of the three poles , the physically relevant pole is given by  @xcite @xmath184\\right],\\ ] ] where once again the different signs define a prograde ( retrograde ) orbit .",
    "in the limit of @xmath185 , both @xmath183 and @xmath186 move towards the horizon of the black hole , @xmath187 in the maximally rotating case of @xmath188 , we can not distinguish between the last stable orbit and the light ring .",
    "this means , the greater the spin of the bh , the closer the particle can approach to it before beginning the plunge phase . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath189 , the position of @xmath183 moves outwards from the bh .",
    "thus the particle begins its plunge much earlier than in the prograde case .",
    "finally , for a particle in an orbit about a schwarzschild black hole the above equations give the familiar position of @xmath190 for the lso and @xmath191 for the photon ring .      as discussed in the introduction it has not been possible to derive an exact analytical expression for the flux of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system although analytic approximate expressions , and exact numerical results , have been computed . in the interesting case of two comparable masses in orbit around each other post - newtonian methods",
    "have been used to derive an expression for the flux to quite a high order in the expansion parameter . however , since post - newtonian theory is known to be poorly convergent , especially when the expansion parameter approaches unity , it has been suggested to employ in its place an equivalent rational polynomial , or pad approximation , to the ( modified ) flux function . since the purpose of this paper is to test the effectiveness of such an approximation we need a firm ground on which we can conduct our test .    in the case of a test mass in an equatorial orbit around a kerr black hole numerical methods have been used to compute the flux to all post - newtonian orders .",
    "this is , of course , valid only in the limit of vanishingly small mass of the test body as compared to the central object .",
    "however , all the relativistic corrections , including hereditary effects , such as the back scattering of gravitational waves off the curved background geometry , would be present in this computation .",
    "the deformation of the geometry due to the presence of the second body , or the back reaction of the waves on the motion of the test body , which would in turn affect the emission process , will not have been included in such a calculation .",
    "the deformation of the geometry , parametrized by the symmetric mass ratio of the system @xmath192 is important only a few orbits before the two objects merge .",
    "this should be expected from the fact that both in newtonian and einsteinian gravity it has been possible to construct an effective one - body formalism to describe the dynamics of a binary and the dynamics derived within this formalism is expected to be valid close to the point when the two bodies plunge towards each other . therefore , we expect that the deformation of the system will not bring about a major change in the analytic behaviour of the flux and lessons learnt in the test mass approximation will be applicable , albeit qualitatively , in the comparable mass case .",
    "thus , our strategy is to employ the test mass exact flux computed numerically together with the analytic expression for the energy function discussed in the previous section .",
    "these two exact functions , together with the energy balance equation , can be used to construct an exact phasing formula for the inspiral signal .",
    "we shall also define an approximate phasing formula using the corresponding post - newtonian expansions of the two functions .",

    "we notice from the form of the series expansion for the flux , eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) , that we begin to encounter logarithmic terms at order @xmath211 and above .",
    "in general , series approximations of this form have slow convergence properties . in order to prepare the series representation of the flux for creating the pad approximation , it is convenient if we factor out the logarithmic terms .",
    "we can then write eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) as @xmath212 \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\,c_{_{k}}x^{k}\\right],\\ ] ] where the new coefficients @xmath213 and @xmath214 are functions of the old coefficients @xmath215 and @xmath216 as in ref .",
    "@xcite the log - terms have been `` normalized '' using the value of the velocity parameter at the lso ; this helps in reducing the importance of the log - terms .",
    "factoring out the logarithmic terms aids in constructing the rational polynomial , or the pad approximation , of the reminder .",
    "moreover , since we expect the flux to have a pole at the location of the light ring it is best to factor out the expected pole so that the reminder has good analytical properties . to this end",
    "we create the factored flux function , @xmath217 by the operation @xmath218 factoring out the pole also helps to alleviate the problem arising from the absence of the linear term in the pn expansion of the flux .",
    "( note that @xmath219 in both the schwarzschild and kerr cases . )",
    "we can see from appendix  [ sec : padeapp ] that in the absence of such a term the continued fraction form of the pad approximation , the so - called diagonal pad approximant , would lead either to zero or infinite pad coefficients .",
    "the above operation rectifies this problem by introducing a linear term into the taylor series for the flux . if we write the expression in full we obtain @xmath220 \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\,f_{_{k}}x^{k}\\right ] , \\label{eq : fluxf}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 and @xmath222 @xmath223 .",
    "we can now construct a new flux function by using the pad approximant of the factored flux given above .",
    "indeed , we can construct two variants of the new flux : the first one is what we call the _ direct _ or d - pad approximant , which is obtained by directly starting from the flux function @xmath224 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxf ] ) and constructing the equivalent rational polynomial .",
    "this is the approach followed in dis .",
    "an alternative approach to this is motivated by the fact that in the gravitational wave phasing formula the flux appears in the denominator .",
    "thus , instead of constructing the pad approximant of the flux function one could first construct the polynomial expansion of the inverse of the flux function and construct the pad approximant of the resulting polynomial .",
    "we call the approximant constructed this way as",
    "_ inverse- _ or i - pad approximant because it is obtained from the taylor expansion of the _ inverse _ of the flux function @xmath224 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxf ] ) . thus ,",
    "our two improved versions of the flux are defined as follows : the direct pad approximant is defined by @xmath225p^ { m}_{m+\\epsilon}\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\,f_{_{k}}x^{k}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath226 is the diagonal or sub - diagonal pad approximant , @xmath227 with @xmath228 or @xmath229 depending on whether @xmath157 is even or odd .",
    "the inverse pad approximant of flux is defined by @xmath230p^ { m}_{m+\\epsilon}\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\,d_{_{k}}x^{k}\\right],\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath231 in the taylor expansion are defined by @xmath232 one finds @xmath231 by first expanding the rhs in a binomial series and then identifying the coefficients of the various terms with those on the lhs .",
    "having constructed the rational polynomials equivalent to a given truncated taylor series of the modified flux function we can return to the original flux function that appears in the phasing formula .",
    "we shall call the flux function so constructed as _ p - approximant , _ and not just pad approximant to remind ourselves that the new flux has been obtained by improving the convergence properties in two steps ( i.e. , definition of a new flux function and the construction of its rational polynomial ) and not just a direct application of pad approximation .",
    "thus , we define the _ direct p - approximant _ of flux as @xmath233 and _ inverse p - approximant _ as , @xmath234^{-1}.\\ ] ] detailed investigation shows that inverse p - approximants of flux , namely @xmath235 have better convergence properties than direct p - approximants .",
    "we shall therefore use only @xmath236 in all our investigations in the rest of this paper .      in this section",
    "we will look at the convergence properties of the post - newtonian series representations and the improved p - approximants of the flux function discussed in the last section . to this end",
    "we shall employ all the post - newtonian orders up to which the taylor expansions have been worked out in the kerr case .",
    "we shall investigate the convergence of the approximants in the case of a test particle ( i.e. , @xmath237 limit ) either co - rotating ( i.e. , @xmath238 _ prograde orbits _ ) or counter - rotating ( i.e. , @xmath239 _ retrograde orbits _ ) , with respect to a central black hole whose spin parameter @xmath0 takes nine values over the full range from @xmath240 in this section we shall make a graphical comparison of the analytical and numerical fluxes and assess the performance of the flux with respect to variation in the spin - parameter values at increasingly higher post - newtonian orders .",
    "we will find that neither the post - newtonian series nor their improved versions fit the numerical flux exactly when the parameters are chosen to be the same for analytical fluxes as the numerical flux .",
    "however , the p - approximant fluxes agree with the numerical fluxes quite closely when their spin values are slightly mis - matched with the true values of the numerical fluxes",
    ". the post - newtonian approximants do show this improved behaviour , albeit not to the extent of p - approximants .",

    "[ fig : ktp ] we have plotted the newton - normalized numerical fluxes alongside analytical fluxes for both the truncated taylor approximants ( four panels on the left ) and ( inverse ) p - approximants ( four panels on the right ) . for each approximant , we consider four post - newtonian orders at \\{@xmath247 } and five spin values .",
    "the solid lines with increasing thickness correspond to the exact numerical fluxes at progressively larger values of the spin parameter starting at @xmath248 ( thinnest line ) and ending at @xmath249 ( thickest line ) .",
    "the corresponding dashed lines represent the analytical approximant to the gw flux .",
    "let us first concentrate on the post - newtonian fluxes : we notice immediately that at all values of @xmath0 , and large values of @xmath250 the 2.5 post - newtonian approximant @xmath251 is highly divergent .",
    "indeed , this order has been known to exhibit improper behaviour in the schwarzschild case and continues to be so for prograde orbits in kerr .",
    "the situation improves at @xmath252 but begins to worsen again at @xmath253 becoming highly divergent at @xmath254 .",
    "the plots serve to illustrate the principal problem with the pn expansion : going to higher orders of the approximation does not necessarily correspond to a better accuracy .    the sequence of panels on the right - hand - side of fig .  [",
    "fig : ktp ] demonstrates that the p - approximant flux has improved convergence properties over the post - newtonian flux for the same range of post - newtonian orders and spins .",
    "the extreme divergence which the post - newtonian flux exhibited at @xmath251 and @xmath255 has been cured .",
    "let us note , however , that sometimes the rational polynomial approximation of a taylor series can produce spurious poles in the region of interest  .",
    "an example of this can be seen at @xmath256 which shows a spurious pole at every value of @xmath244 the main factor that stands out in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ktp ] is the following : the p - approximant fluxes display the same characteristic shape as the numerical fluxes although they do nt agree with the exact flux at higher values of the parameter @xmath257     to @xmath241 for a test particle in retrograde orbit around a kerr black hole .",

    ". however , we must remember that what is more important is how the phasing of the waveforms defined by the two approximants match with that defined by the exact flux , rather than a simple graphical agreement of the flux .",
    "the graphical display is useful as it gives us a rough idea on any improvement in performance of a particular model .",
    "but as the noise of the interferometer weights the inner - product between templates , it may emphasize a particular range of frequency of the waveform more than the other .",
    "it may turn out that the divergent region of a particular model is outside the detector bandwidth for most masses . in such cases",
    "the approximant may work well in spite of the divergences or poles .",
    "we shall return to this question in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] when we consider the matching of waveforms .",
    "we now focus on the gw flux from a test - mass counter - rotating with respect to the black hole .",
    "we will again use a similar set of spin values , i.e. @xmath260 as well as the schwarzschild flux for comparative purposes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ktr ] , left panels , we plot the taylor approximant flux for retrograde orbits .",
    "the solid lines in the figure correspond to the exact numerical fluxes with thicker lines corresponding to smaller spin values @xmath261 and @xmath262 respectively .",
    "the correspondingly thickened dashed lines represent the taylor series approximation to the gw flux with the same spin magnitude as the numerical flux .",
    "the right panels are the same except that in place of taylor approximant fluxes we plot the inverse p - approximant fluxes .",
    "the first thing we notice is that just as in the case of prograde motion the @xmath251 and @xmath255 approximants are again highly divergent although at @xmath255 , the convergence of the pn approximation improves as we go to larger negative spins .",
    "this is not entirely surprising : as we go to larger counter - rotating spins the higher order taylor expansion coefficients become smaller and the non - linear general relativistic corrections are not as important as in the case of prograde orbits .",
    "moreover , the position of the lso moves outwards from the bh as @xmath0 becomes more negative . at @xmath263 ,",
    "the lso is at @xmath264 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath265 at @xmath266 the lso has moved outwards to @xmath267 , corresponding to @xmath268 . if we compare this to the equivalent spins in the prograde case we find that for @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 . at @xmath249 , @xmath272 and @xmath273 . in other words ,",
    "retrograde orbits are weakly bounded orbits in comparison to prograde orbits and experience smaller relativistic corrections . recalling that gravitational wave luminosity @xmath274 retrograde flux for @xmath266 at lso is smaller by a factor @xmath275 compared to prograde flux for @xmath249 at lso . consequently , the pn approximation seems to work well in the retrograde case .    in the case of retrograde orbits p - approximants",
    "provide , at order @xmath276 only a marginal improvement over t - approximants .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the prograde case where the improvement was excellent . at orders @xmath277 and @xmath255 are again quite good , with no poles at @xmath278 for most spin values . while there seems to be a less obvious benefit in using the p - approximant flux in the retrograde case , it is again important to note that the p - approximants show the same general behaviour as the exact flux in the retrograde case too and can therefore be expected to match the true general relativistic signal more closely .      in the last two sections we noted how the p - approximant sequence seems to have a character similar to the sequence given by the numerical computations",
    "although the two do not agree perfectly .",
    "this suggests that if the value of the spin parameter used in the t- or p - approximant fluxes is varied relative to the true value of the spin parameter in the exact flux , we should be able to obtain a better fit to the numerical fluxes . while we will initially do this graphically , we remind the reader that this exercise is purely demonstrative . as the fluxes are newton - normalized ,",
    "it is difficult to say in what region of the velocity we should attempt to make the best fit .",
    "added to this is the fact that when matching templates we should take the weighting of the psd into account .",
    "however , if the approximant fluxes agree graphically well with the numerical fluxes then it would mean that we should be able to match the t- or p - approximant flux with the numerical result without introducing any new parameters . to examine how best mis - matching spins might work",
    "we will focus on one of the post - newtonian orders , say @xmath252 the order at which the t - approximants work well and p - approximants have no spurious poles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitt ] , left panel , we have plotted the best - fit for the t - approximant flux for various values of the spin magnitude from @xmath279 ( top most curve ) to @xmath280 ( bottom most curve ) . for each spin magnitude we have fitted the t - approximant with the numerical result as best as possible by varying the spin - magnitude of the approximant . in best fitting the numerical flux we incurred errors ( defined as @xmath281 ) in the spin magnitude of the approximant relative to the exact case .",
    "these are listed in table [ table : bestfit ] .",
    "although the errors decrease as we approach the extreme prograde flux , we can see from the figure that the fit is not very good for the taylor approximant for @xmath282 schwarzschild case .",
    ".the `` best - fit '' value of the spin parameter , @xmath0 , for t and p - approximant fluxes for @xmath279 to @xmath280 . for the schwarzschild case",

    "we have applied p - approximant templates to the case of a ns orbiting kerr bhs of varying mass and spin . when graphically matching the numerical fluxes we found that the p - approximant fluxes gave a better fit as compared to the pn fluxes , especially when we varied the value of the spin parameter and best fitted the exact flux .",
    "however , the true test of how well a template performs is reflected by the fitting factors achieved . using a signal waveform constructed from the exact expression for the orbital energy and numerical fluxes from black hole perturbation theory",
    ", we were able to compare the performance of t and p - approximant templates . in the case of retrograde , schwarzschild and prograde orbits ,",
    "not only did the p - approximants gave better and more reliable fitting factors , they also gave smaller biases in the estimation of parameters .",
    "we also saw the true power of the p - approximant templates in that we were able to generate templates right up to the lso .",
    "this is something that was not possible with the t - approximant templates due to the approximation for the flux function becoming negative before the lso is reached .",
    "this restricted just how much of the numerical waveform we could model .",
    "while not being completely correct due to the fact that we omitted the finite - mass correction terms , we also saw that the p - approximant templates gave the best performance when in the equal - mass case .",
    "the bias in the estimation of parameters is particularly poor in the case of t - approximants especially for high - mass systems . since",
    "high - mass systems can be seen to a greater distance , and therefore likely to be the first sources to be detected , it is important to keep in mind that the bias in the estimation of parameters could be as large as the random errors associated with the measurement .",
    "such biases could seriously affect the test of general relativity @xcite that are envisaged to be carried out with the aid of high - mass systems .",
    "it is clear that for the type of systems examined in this paper , namely equatorial test - mass circular orbits in kerr , p - approximant templates are to be preferred over their pn counterparts in both detection and measurement .",
    "it remains to be seen if p - approximants ( or their improved versions ) prove to be good enough when considering generic orbits in kerr and for comparable mass systems with spinning black holes on generic orbits .",

    "let @xmath285 be an analytic function whose taylor expansion in @xmath250 denoted @xmath286 is @xmath287    we construct the pad approximation @xmath288 of @xmath289 by equating the polynomial expansion with a rational function to the same order according to @xmath290 where @xmath160{\\frac{\\displaystyle # 1}{\\displaystyle # 2 } } \\frac{b_{n}(x)}{d_{m}(x ) } = \\dfrac{\\sum_{n=0}^{n } b_{n}\\,x^{n}}{\\\\   \\sum_{n=0}^{m } d_{n}\\,x^{n } } , \\label{eq : ratfunc2}\\ ] ] such that @xmath291 .",
    "the benefit of using pad approximants over taylor approximants is that the error in the approximation after @xmath292 terms reduces by a factor of @xmath293  @xcite .",
    "if we let @xmath294 , where @xmath228 or @xmath295 , we construct the `` diagonal '' and `` sub - diagonal '' pad approximants respectively .",
    "the advantage of this is that we can cast the rational function in the form of a continued fraction , i.e. @xmath296 if we use the rational function interpretation , eq .",
    "[ eq : ratfunc2 ] , each time we go to a higher order @xmath157 of approximation , we have to recalculate each of the coefficients , @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "however , by using the continued fraction formalism , we only have to calculate the newest coefficient , @xmath299 . as an example , consider the taylor expansion @xmath300 by matching this to a pad approximation of the same order we get @xmath301 solving for the pad coefficients , @xmath299 , gives us @xmath302 if we now go to the next order , i.e. @xmath303 and solve for the coefficients @xmath299 once more , we obtain @xmath304 the example shows that as we go to higher and higher orders in @xmath12 , we only have to calculate one new coefficient as all the lower order coefficients remain constant . consequently , there is a sense of stability in the behaviour of the continued fraction coefficients and convergence is easier to test .",
    "there are , unfortunately , problems with pad approximation that one should bear in mind : firstly , there are regions where pad approximants diverge while taylor approximants converge . the second , and perhaps most important",
    "feature is that when pad approximation does indeed converge , we can not be sure that it converges to the exact function that we had in mind  @xcite . it should therefore always be kept in mind that there are inherent difficulties in using pad approximants .",
    "finally , pad approximants sometimes exhibit spurious poles in the region of interest .",
    "however , as one will be able to test _ a priori _ the existence of poles one can avoid the use of such approximants ."
