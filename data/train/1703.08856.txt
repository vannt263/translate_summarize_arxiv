    "spin-@xmath0 fermions that are massless ( or approximately so ) are unique in that the axial symmetry in their classical description gets broken in quantized theory , a fundamental feature known as the chiral anomaly  @xcite .",
    "examples of such chiral fermions include e.g. light quarks / leptons in the standard model of particle physics or emergent quantum states of electrons in the so - called dirac and weyl semimetals .",
    "recently there has been a rapidly growing interest in understanding the implications of microscopic quantum anomaly on the macroscopic properties of chiral matter , i.e. many - body systems with chiral fermions .",
    "it has been found that the chiral anomaly leads to a number of anomalous chiral transport processes that are absent in normal materials , such as the chiral magnetic effect  @xcite , chiral magnetic wave  @xcite , chiral vortical effects  @xcite , etc .",
    "enthusiastic efforts have been made to search for manifestation of these effects in two known types of chiral matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in heavy ion collisions  @xcite as well as the dirac and weyl semimetals  @xcite .",
    "see recent reviews in e.g.  @xcite    let us focus on the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) , which predicts the generation of an electric current @xmath1 along the magnetic field @xmath2 applied to the system , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the chiral magnetic conductivity , taking a universal value of @xmath5 in thermal equilibrium ( for each species of chiral fermions ) , with @xmath6 the chiral chemical potential that quantifies the imbalance between fermions of opposite ( right - handed , rh versus left - handed , lh ) chirality .",
    "the search of cme in qgp has proven difficult , due to the complicated environment in heavy ion collisions .",
    "one major issue is that the magnetic field @xmath7 , necessary for driving the cme current ( [ eq_cme ] ) , is provided by the fast moving ions themselves .",
    "such magnetic field has been extensively studied  @xcite and found to likely last only for a short time after the impact of the two colliding ions .",
    "there is the possibility that the electrically conducting partonic matter created in the collision would develop induction current ( upon deceasing magnetic field ) and thus considerably elongate its duration .",
    "whether this may quantitatively work , remains to be seen .",
    "this situation therefore poses a challenge : during the time when the magnetic field is substantial ( thus the cme current most significant ) , the partonic matter could still be far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the quantitative modeling of cme in heavy ion collisions has only been recently achieved for the hydrodynamic stage and after  @xcite , so there remains a crucial gap to fill , namely quantifying the cme during the out - of - equilibrium stage in heavy ion collisions . in this paper , we aim to make an important step forward in addressing this pressing problem for the search of cme in qgp .",
    "equipped with the theoretical tool of chiral kinetic theory , we make a first phenomenological study of the cme - induced charge separation in the pre - thermal stage as well as its subsequent hydrodynamic evolution in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the theoretical framework to describe anomalous chiral transport in the out - of - equilibrium case is the recently developed chiral kinetic theory  @xcite . by introducing @xmath8 correction to the classical equations of motion",
    ", it incorporates chiral anomaly related effects into the usual kinetic equation . in the following we present the necessary ingredients of this theory to be used for this work .",
    "the kinetic equation to be solved takes the usual form : @xmath9 f_i(\\vec{\\bf x},\\vec{\\bf p},t ) = c[f_i ]   \\,\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath10 is the distribution function in the phase space of position @xmath11 and momentum @xmath12 , for each specie ( labelled by @xmath13 ) of chiral fermions .",
    "the @xmath14 $ ] is the collision term .",
    "the important change as compared with usual classical kinetic theory , is in the equations of motion  @xcite : @xmath15 in the above , an anomalous velocity term @xmath16 is introduced , with the berry curvature @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 for positive / negative helicity respectively ) . in this work",
    "we only consider an external magnetic field @xmath2 , and @xmath19 is the electric charge of the type-@xmath13 fermions .",
    "the equations can be rewritten as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a phase space factor , and @xmath22 is conserved .",
    "the local current density is : @xmath23 with @xmath24 . if one inserts a thermal fermi - dirac distribution in the above , the equilibrium cme current ( [ eq_cme ] ) is reproduced . for more details of ckt , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "given the above chiral kinetic theory , it is of great interest to find possible analytic solutions . in the following we consider solutions for two different cases of the collision term , with a magnetic field @xmath25 that is along @xmath26-axis with constant magnitude across space but is time - dependent .",
    "the first case is the collision - less limit , i.e. @xmath27=0 $ ] . in this case",
    "the particles will simply undergo `` free''-streaming according to the trajectory determined from the equations of motion ( [ eq_eom ] ) .",
    "note that such trajectory is different from the usual classical trajectory due to the anomalous term . for a particle with initial position @xmath28 and initial momentum @xmath29 at time @xmath30 , its position and momentum at a later time @xmath31",
    "are given by : @xmath32 @xmath33 in the above @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "equivalently , a particle found to have position @xmath11 and momentum @xmath12 at a time @xmath31 can be traced back to a state of @xmath37 and @xmath38 at initial time , given by : @xmath39 @xmath40    therefore given an initial condition @xmath41 , the solution in the collisionless case , is simply the following : @xmath42 the current @xmath43 can then be computed according to ( [ eq_ckt_j ] ) .",
    "we next consider the case with a collision term of the form @xmath14 = -\\alpha\\ ,   f_i + \\beta $ ] where @xmath44 are both certain functions of position , momentum and time  @xcite .",
    "the familiar relaxation time approximation ( rta ) is a special case of this form , with @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the relaxation time parameter ) and @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are local equilibrium parameters to be determined from energy density and charge density ) . with this collision term",
    ", the formal exact solution to the kinetic equation is given by  @xcite : @xmath50 where again the @xmath51 is the initial condition .",
    "the @xmath52 are the position and momentum at any intermediate time moment @xmath53 as determined by eq.([eq:001 ] ) and eq.([eq:002 ] ) . again",
    "the corresponding current can be computed according to ( [ eq_ckt_j ] ) . specifically in the rta case",
    "the current takes the form : @xmath54 }   . \\ ] ] in the above the current evolves from dominance of the `` memory '' of initial condition toward dominance of thermal equilibrium , with @xmath46 controlling the time scale .",
    "with the above obtained solutions to the chiral kinetic equation , we now apply them for estimating the chiral magnetic current that can be generated during the early moments in heavy ion collisions when the created dense partonic matter is still out - of - equilibrium while the magnetic field is the strongest . in passing ,",
    "we note that there has been study of pre - thermal chiral magnetic effect using classical - statistical field simulations  @xcite .",
    "we also note that there has been attempt of applying chiral kinetic transport for describing long time evolution of the fireball assuming very long @xmath55 field duration  @xcite .",

    "we will use a formation time @xmath61 as the starting time of our kinetic evolution of quark distributions until an end time of @xmath62 which is on the order of onset time for hydrodynamic evolution in heavy ion collisions .",

    "[ fig_jy ] we show the @xmath101 with the arrow showing the direction of current : it is evident that the current is aligned with magnetic field ( along @xmath26-axis ) and the magnitude is bigger in the area with larger local quark density .",
    "this cme - induced current will transport positive / negative charges in opposite direction and thus accumulate with time the separation of charges above / below the reaction plane . in fig .",
    "[ fig_nq ] we show the net charge density distribution on the transverse plan at several time moments : indeed one clearly sees the gradual buildup of excessive positive charges on one side of the plane while negative charges on the other side , implying a growing charge separation with time .     on the @xmath103 plane at time @xmath104 ( computed with fd initial distribution , echo magnetic field , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . ]",
    "[ fig_jy ]     ( normalized by @xmath107 ) on the @xmath103 plane at different time ( computed with fd initial distribution , echo magnetic field , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) . ]",
    "let us then quantify the out - of - equilibrium charge separation effect and study its dependence on various ingredients in the modeling . to quantify this effect , we introduce a quantity @xmath108 defined as a ratio of the total number of net charge above reaction plane @xmath109 ( with equal number but opposite net charge @xmath110 below reaction plane ) to the total number of quarks / anti - quarks @xmath111 in the system .",
    "this ratio @xmath112 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rq ] as a function of time @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath112 monotonically grows with time in all cases , reflecting the accumulation of charge separation from continuous cme transport .",
    "one also finds a strong dependence of this effect on the magnetic field evolution with time .",
    "for example , the echo magnetic field ( from magnetohydrodynamic simulations ) could produce a charge separation that is about an order of magnitude larger than the vacuum case .",
    "it is therefore crucial to treat magnetic field as dynamically evolving and properly account for medium feedback on its evolution .     for quantifying charge separation across the reaction plane as a function of time , computed and compared for various choices of time - dependent magnetic field ( with fd initial distribution , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "]    [ fig_rq ]    another way to quantify this cme - induced pre - thermal charge separation , is to define a weighed charge dipole moment of the net charge density distribution on the transverse plane , as follows : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are transverse radial and azimuthal coordinates on @xmath103 plane , @xmath102 is the net charge density while @xmath117 is the total quark / anti - quark number density providing the normalization in defining the dimensionless dipole moment @xmath118 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_nq_fd ] we show @xmath118 as a function of time . in consistency with @xmath112 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rq ] , the dipole moment is found to grow with time and sensitively depends on the time evolution of magnetic field .     for quantifying charge separation as a function of time , computed and compared for various choices of time - dependent magnetic field ( with fd initial distribution , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "]    [ fig_nq_fd ]     as a function of time , computed and compared for three choices ( fd , sg , hg ) of initial momentum distribution ( with echo magnetic field , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) . ]    [ fig_compare_f ]    we next examine the influence of the initial momentum distribution on the resulting charge separation dipole . to do that",
    ", we compare @xmath118 as a function of @xmath113 computed from three different initial distributions ( fd , sg , hg ) : see fig .",
    "[ fig_compare_f ] .",
    "note that for the three distributions the total quark / antiquark number is normalized to be the same for fair comparison .",
    "the results demonstrate a mild dependence on such initial distribution , and appear to indicate that the charge separation could be enhanced if the momentum is more distributed in the soft regime .",
    "finally we study the influence of the relaxation parameter @xmath119 on the resulting charge separation dipole . in fig .",
    "[ fig_compare_relax ] the @xmath118 as a function of @xmath113 is computed for three choices of @xmath119 : collision - less limit @xmath120 , slow relaxation case @xmath121 and fast relaxation case @xmath105 .",
    "the comparison clearly demonstrates that the charge separation increases with decreasing relaxation time ( i.e. stronger scattering in the system ) . this may be understood as follows : more scattering would prevent the quarks / antiquarks from streaming away too quickly thus keeping their density higher to generate more contributions to the anomalous current .     as a function of time , computed and compared for three choices of relaxation time @xmath119 ( with echo magnetic field , fd initial distribution and @xmath106 ) . ]",
    "[ fig_compare_relax ]    so far we have not discussed the influence of two other important ingredients : the initial helicity imbalance parameterized by @xmath85 and the peak magnetic field strength @xmath122 .",
    "in fact the dependence is fairly simple : the charge separation ( described by either @xmath112 or @xmath123 ) is found to be simply linearly proportional to both of these factors .",
    "it may be noted that the obtained pre - thermal cme - induced charge separation effect has been found to be rather small for our current choice of parameters .",
    "this may be due to two factors .",
    "the first is that in the present formulation of chiral kinetic theory the anomalous term responds instantaneously to the applied magnetic field , so the resulting anomalous current decreases in time rapidly along with the magnetic field thus hindering the buildup of charge separation .",
    "this is an important and challenging issue that requires significant effort of further investigation .",
    "the second is that the imbalance in number density between opposite helicity fermions ( that we currently use in these calculations ) is small compared with the relevant system scale @xmath56 which is analogous to the situation of a very small ratio for axial charge density @xmath124 to entropy density in the thermal case .",
    "we end by discussing the implication for the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution stage .",
    "the occurrence of the pre - hydro cme implies that by the time of hydro onset , the fermion density and current can no longer be set as trivially vanishing ( as usually done ) .",
    "instead , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_jy ] and [ fig_nq ] , the per - thermal transport induces a nontrivial initial condition by that time and should be incorporated into the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution as nontrivial initial conditions for the various fermion currents including both the zeroth component ( i.e. density ) and the spatial component ( vector 3-current density ) . with the recently developed anomlaous - viscous fluid dynamics ( avfd )",
    "framework  @xcite , we have tested and demonstrated that indeed such pre - hydro charge separation can be built into hydro initial conditions and will survive through the hydro stage to contribute to the final hadron observables .",
    "in summary , we have performed a first phenomenological study of the cme - induced charge separation during the pre - thermal stage in heavy ion collisions .",
    "such study will be very important for addressing the crucial challenge due to the fact that the extremely strong magnetic field in such collisions may last only for a brief moment and the cme current may have to occur at so early a stage that the quark - gluon matter is still far from thermal equilibrium . utilizing the tool of chiral kinetic theory , we have developed analytic solutions for the collision - less limit and the relaxation time approximation .",
    "we have quantified the net charge dipole moment arising from the per - thermal cme - induced charge separation and studied its dependence on various choices of magnetic field time evolution , on initial momentum distribution as well as on the system relaxation time .",
    "finally the implication of pre - thermal cme for the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution has been discussed . with this proof - of - concept study",
    ", we aim to develop in the future a more comprehensive and realistic pre - thermal cme modeling tool that will also be seamlessly integrated with an anomalous hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "one lesson we ve learned from the present study is that the magnetic field driven effects may be significant during the early stage when the field is most strong .",
    "for example the pre - thermal cme leads to nontrivially modified initial conditions for hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "in addition to such transport effects , it could be anticipated that the early time magnetic field may have an even stronger and more direct influence on the particles that are dominantly produced through initial hard processes  @xcite , such as the high momentum quarkonia as well as high momentum dileptons and photons . during the formation of these particles at the earliest moments after a collision ,",
    "the strong magnetic field ( and the anomalous transport of partons driven by it ) may possibly leave a measurable imprint in their production , which would be a topic of future study .",
