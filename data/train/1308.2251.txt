    "it is a real pleasure and a great honor for the author to contribute , with this paper , to the festschrift dedicated to professor myroslav holovko at the occasion of his @xmath1 birthday .",
    "myroslav is an expert of the collective variables ( cv ) method introduced by the ukrainian school in the framework of which wilson s ideas on the renormalization group ( rg )  @xcite can be implemented with great effect  @xcite . here",
    "we expose recent post - wilsonian advances on the rg in the framework of statistical field theory .",
    "obviously , many of the ideas exposed here could easily be transposed to the cv `` world '' by the readers of references  @xcite where the links between the cv method and standard statistical field theory are established .",
    "these last past years , wilson s approach to the rg  @xcite has been the subject of a revival in both statistical physics and quantum field theory . since the seminal work of wilson ,",
    "two main formulations of the non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) have been developed in parallel .",

    "@xcite on the one hand and parola _ et al .",
    "_ in the other hand  @xcite . in this corpus of works",
    "one is interested to establish and to solve the flow equations of the gibb s free energy by means of non - perturbative methods . in an alternative formulation , polchinski and",
    "his followers consider rather the flow of the wilsonian action  @xcite , instead of that of the free energy , which makes the method more abstract and less predictive than that of wetterich , although more in accord with wilson s ideas .",
    "the link between these two formulations can however be established , see for instance references  @xcite .",
    "other non - perturbative methods based either on the cv or monte carlo methods are also the subject of active studies and are discussed , for instance , in reference  @xcite and references quoted herein .",
    "the nprg has proved its ability to describe * both universal and non universal * quantities for various models of statistical and condensed matter physics * near or even far * from criticality .",
    "recently it has been extended to models defined on a lattice  @xcite .",
    "successful applications to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising , xy , heisenberg models  @xcite and @xmath0 model  @xcite are noteworthy . here",
    "we extend the study of reference  @xcite on the @xmath0 model in three dimensions of space to the case @xmath2 ; it was made possible by the recent publication by loh of a novel numerical method to compute the lattice green s functions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 version of the @xmath0 model on a lattice describes the field of a higgs boson on the lattice in interaction with itself  @xcite ; our conclusions concerning the type of transition it undergoes are thus of theoretical importance .    as in our former study of the @xmath3 version of the model , we work in the framework of the local potential approximation @xcite but here we consider only the case of the litim - machado - dupuis infra - red cut - off introduced in refs  @xcite this regulator has been shown to give much more better results than other sharp regulators in  @xcite . as in references  @xcite the flow equations are numerically integrated out for the so - called threshold functions  @xcite rather than for the potential .",
    "the resulting flow equations belong to the class of quasi - linear parabolic partial differential equations ( pde ) for which several efficient and unconditionally convergent numerical algorithms have been developed by mathematicians  @xcite . as in references",
    "@xcite we made use of an algorithm proposed by douglas - jones  @xcite to solve our nprg flow equations , both * above * and * below * the critical temperature ; this yields an easy and precise determination of the critical point .",
    "the critical line of the model is obtained for a large range of parameters ; unfortunately , and contrary to the case @xmath3",
    "@xcite , we were unable to find available monte carlo simulations to which to compare our data .",
    "we stress that , in the wide range of parameters considered in our study ( see table  [ tab ] ) , we exclude the occurrence of a first order transition .",
    "this conclusion seems in agreement with a general analysis of the criticality of the model made in reference  @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized a follows : in section  [ seci ] we review briefly the basic definitions and results concerning the statistical mechanics of scalar fields on a lattice .",

    "in reference  @xcite we obtained an excellent agreement between our estimates of the critical line of the @xmath318 @xmath0 model on a simple three dimensional lattice and that of monte carlo simulations of hasenbush  @xcite . in @xmath3 the lpa approximation does not yield the exact critical exponents contrary to the case @xmath2 where the classical exponents are found .",
    "one can thus _ a fortiori _ expect an excellent agreement for the critical line between the theory and the simulations in @xmath4 .",
