    "the dusty gas disks surrounding t tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars are believed to be the birthplaces of planets and have for this reason be the subject of intense study in the last two decades . with the advent of high sensitivity space infrared telescopes such as the spitzer space telescope ( sst formally known as sirtf ) , and ground - based infrared interferometers such as the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) ,",
    "these ` protoplanetary disks ' can now be studied in unprecedented detail .",
    "this puts a high pressure on theoretical modeling efforts of the structure and appearance of these disks ( * ? ? ?",

    "* e.g. ) . some of the simplifying assumptions that were used so far may no longer be justified , since observations now start to be able to distinguish between simplified and more realistic disk models .",
    "one of the main assumptions underlying virtually all disk structure models to date is the assumption of perfect thermal coupling between the dust and the gas .",
    "since the dust carries all the continuum opacity , it is the dust that influences the continuum radiative transfer through the disk , and thereby determines the dust temperature at every location in the disk .",
    "the assumption that the gas temperature is equal to the dust temperature then makes it possible to solve the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , thus yielding the density structure of the disk .",
    "the combined temperature and density stucture of the disk constitutes the self - consistent disk model from which the spectral energy disribution ( sed ) and images can be derived and compared to observations .",
    "however , it has long been debated whether the assumption of equal dust and gas temperature holds in the surface layers of the disk ( * ? ? ? * e.g. ) . above a certain height above the midplane",
    "this dust - gas coupling is so low that the gas will find its own thermal balance : a balance between gas heating processes such as the photoelectric effect and dissociation processes on the one hand , and gas cooling via atomic and molecular lines on the other hand .",
    "the structure of this very tenuous upper part of the disk will then be similar to that of pdrs , photon - dominated regions ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) as already noted by e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is the question whether this decoupling height is above or below the superheated layer .",
    "it is also important to compute how the gas temperature will behave above the decoupling height , and what consequences this has for observations of certain molecular line species .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present 1 + 1d models for the vertical temperature structure of the disk in which dust - gas decoupling is taken into account .",
    "we first present the underlying vertical density structure models and the physics that go into the self - consistent gas temperature and chemistry calculation ( sect .",

    "our model calculations start from the 1 + 1d vertical density structure models of ( * ? ? ? * henceforth dzn02 ) . in these models the dust and gas temperature were assumed to be equal . in fig .",

    "[ tdusttgas ] illustrates the dust temperature in this disk model .",
    "as one can see , the dust temperature is lowest at the midplane .",
    "the dust at the midplane is only heated by thermal infrared emission from the surface layers . as one goes toward higher @xmath4 , initially the dust temperature rises slowly , but upon approaching the @xmath5 surface ( @xmath6 ) of the disk it rises more steeply .",

    "even higher @xmath4 the dust temperature profile levels off to a constant .",
    "this is the optically thin dust temperature : these grains here are directly exposed to the central star since they reside well above the photosphere . in the computation of this model",

    "the white dashed line shows the contour which includes 95% of the disk mass.,width=340 ]    in the present paper , however , we take this model one step further and calculate the gas temperature self - consistently .",
    "however , we keep the density structure and the _ dust _ temperature the same as the dzn02 models . in order to compute the gas temperature we need to solve the energy balance equation for the gas .      in order to compute the abundances of the dominant cooling species",
    ", we must include a chemical network into our model .",
    "the chemistry has been described in detail in @xcite , and is partly based on rates from the umist database @xcite .",
    "the chemical network consists of 47 species : h , h@xmath0 , h@xmath9 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 , he , he@xmath0 , c , c@xmath0 , o , o@xmath0 , s , s@xmath0 , si , si@xmath0 , mg , mg@xmath0 , fe , fe@xmath0 , ch , ch@xmath0 , ch@xmath2 , ch@xmath10 , ch@xmath12 , ch@xmath11 , ch@xmath13 , ch@xmath14 , ch@xmath15 , co , co@xmath0 , hco , hco@xmath0 , o@xmath2 , o@xmath10 , oh , oh@xmath0 , h@xmath2o , h@xmath2o@xmath0 , h@xmath12o@xmath0 , sio , sio@xmath0 , sih , sih@xmath0 , sih@xmath10 , sioh@xmath0 , e@xmath9 .",
    "those species are connected through 266 reactions including neutral - neutral , ion - molecule , photoionization and photodissociation reactions .",
    "we account also for cosmic ray induced photoreactions and charge exchange reactions .",
    "neither grain surface reactions nor ice formation are included , because the temperatures in the upper disk layers do not allow a significant freeze out of molecules .",
    "some reactions are treated in more detail like the h@xmath2 and co photodissociation .",
    "these two reaction rates are derived by using the uv flux and proper shielding factors at the center of the dissociating band . for details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "c ionization is treated in a similar way by integrating the photoionization cross section shortward of 1100     and accounting for h@xmath2 and c self shielding .",
    "depending on the he abundance and on the way the c ionization is treated , the c@xmath0/c / co transition can shift as a function of depth in the disk : the relatively small fraction of he@xmath0 obtained by cosmic ray ionization can be sufficient to destroy co even at locations , where it is already shielded from the stellar uv radiation field .",
    "table  [ abus ] summarizes the element abundances used in the following calculations .",
    ".elemental abundances @xmath16 with respect to hydrogen in the standard disk model . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : heatcool ]    in table  [ tab : heatcool ] , we list all the processes that are included in the present model .",
    "since the heating and cooling rates depend on the abundances of the individual species , the chemistry and the thermal balance have to be solved interatively .",
    "this is done using ridder s method and reevaluating the chemistry for every new temperature guess .",
    "convergence is typically achieved within 10 steps .",
    "the optical depth of molecular and atomic lines can be much higher than that of the dust continuum .",
    "therefore , high above the actual photosphere of the disk the molecular lines can still be optically thick .",
    "line cooling , even above the continuum photosphere , is therefore a process in which radiative transfer effects in the molecular lines must in principle be taken into account .",
    "unfortunately it is still quite challenging to compute the detailed radiative transfer in all the molecular line species simultaneously with the solution of a chemical network .",
    "as a first step we therefore employ an escape probability formalism . given a certain line optical depth @xmath17 , the escape probability @xmath18 describes the probability that a photon escapes from this line .",
    "the escape probability function is actually derived by an integration over all possible escape paths ( inward directed photons are absorbed in the disk ) and a gaussian line profile .",
    "this is a quite standard procedure in studies of pdrs , and therefore we adopt it here as well .",
    "we use the formulas for @xmath18 and line optical depth presented in the appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the optical depth in all cooling lines in vertical direction @xmath4 is @xmath19 @xmath20 is the transition probability of the line , @xmath21 the velocity of light , @xmath22 the line frequency , @xmath23 the line broadening , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the upper and lower level densities , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 the upper and lower level statistical weights . the escape probability can be derived from the optical depth @xmath17 @xmath28 the maximum escape probability is 0.5 , because of the slab geometry .",
    "the physics of the upper layers of the disk is , similar to pdrs , regulated by the influx of uv and optical radiation from an external source . in our case",
    "this is the central star . in ordinary pdr calculations",
    "the source of uv radiation is assumed to illuminate the surface of the pdr from above ( under a 90 degree angle from above ) .",
    "in contrast , for protoplanetary disks , the light of the central star penetrates the surface of the disk under a very shallow grazing angle ( called the ` flaring angle ' ) , typically of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "the definition of the flaring angle is : @xmath30 where @xmath6 is the height of the continuum @xmath31 surface for photons emerging from the central star .",
    "a very rough estimate of @xmath6 is the height @xmath4 above the midplane where the temperature of the dust is @xmath32 times the optically thin dust temperature ( see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ tdusttgas ] ) .",
    "because the grazing incident angle @xmath33 is usually very small , stellar radiation can penetrate only very limitedly into the disk , unless dust scattering deflects the uv photons deeper into the disk @xcite .",
    "the way in which this grazing incident angle @xmath33 is included in the model is as follows .",
    "we assume , first of all , that there is no scattering which could deflect ionizing radiation deep into the disk s photosphere .",
    "we can then simply ` mimic ' the effect of the longer path ( compared to vertical incidence ) by multiplying all extinction effects of the stellar radiation by @xmath34 .",
    "the reason is that for each cm in vertical direction , the photons pass in reality through @xmath34 cm of gas by virtue of the grazing angle of @xmath33 .",
    "this means that effectively ( per cm in vertical direction ) the ( self-)shielding of molecular species is @xmath34 times so strong as when the uv source illuminated the layers perfectly from above .",
    "also the radiation responsible for the photoelectric heating effect are extincted by a factor of @xmath34 more efficiently compared to normal pdrs . and",
    "finally , a similar effect takes place for the radiation that excites the higher levels of cooling species .",
    "all in all this has the effect that much of the ` action ' takes place at lower a@xmath35 than would be the case for normal pdrs .",
    "for instance , dissociation boundaries lie higher up in the atmosphere of the disk , and dust - gas decoupling may take place at lower a@xmath35 than would be the case if the uv source would shine 90 degrees from above .",
    "this recipe of enhancing the extinction of stellar light by a factor @xmath36 in order to mimic the effect of shallow incidence is called the ` flaring angle recipe ' . for the cooling via molecular lines such a flaring angle recipe",
    "is not used , because the emitted photons can escape in all directions .",
    "it is of essential importance to resolve the disk in vertical direction in a way that is appropriate for the disk chemistry .",
    "initially , the 1 + 1d vertical density structure model grid is adapted to resolve the dust continuum optical depth scale",
    ". however , the gas chemistry takes place on a different scale . to ensure that we resolve e.g.  the h / h@xmath2 transition , we resampled the grid to a ten times finer resolution by linear interpolation .",
    "the calculation of the combined heating / cooling balance and chemistry is extremely time consuming and should be restricted to those regions , where t@xmath37 t@xmath38 .",
    "however , a simple check at a single grid point is not sufficient to determine , whether t@xmath39 has converged to t@xmath38 , because it could actually be a crossing point .",
    "we implemented here a criterium that checks for a gradual approach of t@xmath39 and t@xmath38 : if both temperatures agree to within 2% over an interval @xmath40 , the detailed balance calculations are stopped and t@xmath41 t@xmath38 is assumed below this point .",
    "we present here one standard model , and some features from a model without pahs .",
    "our standard parameter set is as follows . for the central star",
    "we take a t tauri star with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44k where @xmath45 is the effective temperature of the photosphere of the star .",
    "our disk model is assumed to have a surface density profile @xmath46 given by a powerlaw : @xmath47 with @xmath48  g  @xmath49 . the inner radius of the disk is taken to be @xmath50  au , and the outer radius @xmath51  au . with these parameters",
    "the mass of the disk becomes @xmath52 .",
    "the flaring angle for this model follows automatically from the solution to the equations of dzn02 , and we use this flaring angle ( which is a function of @xmath53 ) as input to the gas heating / cooling and chemistry calculations",

    "the radiation field is assumed to be that of an active young t tauri star . following the recipe described in @xcite , we scaled the solar chromospheric activity backwards to an age of 2myr , assuming an age of 4.6  gyr for our sun . the integrated stellar uv flux is then calculated to be @xmath56 at the stellar surface .",

    ", we used the scaled solar uv flux , the iue observations of the t tauri star hd143006 and a kurucz model with @xmath59k , @xmath60 .",
    "since we do not assume any turbulent mixing , the disk model is divided into vertical slabs and a 1d coupled chemical and heating / cooling calculation is carried out starting at the upper boundary of the model . due to the strong radiation field impinging on the inner disk , which complicates the convergence of the model , we only start our model calculations at 5  au .",

    "the gas temperature in the disk atmosphere is much larger than the dust temperature .",
    "deeper in the disk , slightly above the @xmath61 surface , gas and dust are well collisionally coupled and hence in thermal equilibrium ( within a 10% error margin ) .",
    "a very pronounced feature of these models is the hot region , @xmath62  k in the disk atmosphere at radii smaller than 50  au , which we will address as `` hot finger '' in the following ( the region is labelled in the right panel of fig .  [ tdusttgas ] ) .",
    "another feature of these models is the `` undershoot region '' for the gas temperature around the @xmath61 surface .",
    "this is the region , where the gas temperature contours in fig .",
    "[ tdusttgas ] change their slope and the gas temperature drops actually below the dust temperature . for a more quantitative illustration of this model , we included two perpendicular slices at 20 and 100  au ( fig .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ tdusttgas_nopah ] .",
    "the lower equilibrium gas temperatures in the surface layers are due to the lack of pah heating as compared to the standard model .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to notice that the lower part of the `` hot finger '' is still present in this model . as for the standard model ,",
    "the assumption of t@xmath63 t@xmath38 is satisfied below the @xmath61 surface .",
    "all the above described features are explained in the following paragraphs by a complex combination between gas chemistry and gas heating / cooling processes .",
    "we will concentrate on the standard model and explain only differences arising from the absence of pahs in the second model .",
    "the heating is dominated by photoelectric heating ( pe ) due to pahs and small carbonaceous dust grains . at the lower boundary of the `` hot finger '' , where the electron abundance and hence the pe heating drops , the gas is heated primarily by h@xmath2 formation ( see fig .  [ 20auslice]d ) .",
    "as h@xmath2 becomes the dominant carrier of hydrogen deeper in the disk , this heating process turns off .",
    "we verified that our models resolve the h / h@xmath2 transition . for a more detailed discussion of the h@xmath2 chemistry",
    ", we refer to the next paragraph .",
    "cooling is mainly due to [ oi ] fine structure lines . in the `` hot finger '' region , lyman@xmath33 and h@xmath2 ro - vibrational line cooling are the dominant cooling processes followed by gas - grain collisions ( see fig .  [ 20auslice]c ) . at larger radii , beyond the `` hot finger '' region , the balance between [ oi ] fine structure cooling and pe heating sets the gas temperature ( fig .",
    "[ 100auslice]c and d ) .",
    "the steep temperature rise at the upper boundary of the hot finger is due to a different scaling behaviour of the main heating and cooling rates , photoelectric heating versus [ oi ] line cooling .",
    "pe heating scales roughly as @xmath64 : it depends linearly on the grain number density , which is linked by a constant to the total number density , and it depends indirectly on electron density @xmath65 through the pe heating efficiency .",
    "the higher the electron density , the lower the grain charge and hence the larger the efficiency of the pe heating . given the strong radiation fields that illuminate the surface of the disk , carbon is the main source of electrons , because it is fully ionized : @xmath66 . while the pe heating scales with @xmath64 , cooling is dominated by [ oi ] fine structure lines in nlte and hence scales with @xmath67 .",
    "if the density rises , the increase in pe heating is much larger than the increase in cooling .",
    "therefore , the gas temperature rises .",
    "since pe heating depends only weakly on temperature @xmath68 , @xmath69 has to increase strongly to compensate the density effect .",
    "the temperature levels off again as lte is reached and the cooling lines are collisionally dominated and scaling with @xmath70 .",
    "the high temperatures obtained in this model depend sensitively on the atomic data that enters the calculation of the cooling lines .",
    "the reason is that the pe heating depends only weakly on the gas temperature in the regime of high irradiation .",
    "therefore , any small change in the cooling rates  due to e.g.  uncertainties in the collision cross sections  causes a large change in the equilibrium solution of the gas temperature .",
    "however , this holds only for the uppermost layers of the disk . in the `` hot finger '' region ,",
    "densities are typical of the order of @xmath71  @xmath55 , and oi level population numbers deviate by less than 10% from lte .",
    "thus , the gas temperature in this region is hardly affected by uncertainties in the o - h or o - e@xmath9 collision cross sections .    in the inner regions of the disk , @xmath72",
    "au , the gas temperature shows a steep temperature gradient just below the hot finger ( fig .  [",
    "20auslice]a ) .",
    "this is due to the large drop in h@xmath2 formation heating as most of the hydrogen is turned into molecular hydrogen .",
    "the undershoot feature near the @xmath61 surface is an intrinsic feature that is due to the physical description of the gas - grain interaction .",
    "[ oi ] and co cooling dominate the energy balance in the regions , where t@xmath37 t@xmath38 .",
    "as the density rises towards the midplane , the line cooling is so efficient that t@xmath39 drops even below t@xmath38 .",
    "this feature is not present in the model calculations of @xcite .",
    "if the gas - grain collisional coupling would be larger or the [ oi ] fine - structure line cooling smaller , gas and dust would start to couple at higher @xmath4 in the disk and hence the undershoot region would vanish .",
    "this could e.g.  be achieved by a different density gradient ( [ oi ] fine - structure lines become optically thick at higher @xmath4 ) and/or smaller grains ( gas - grain collisional cooling is enhanced compared to [ oi ] fine - structure lines and co cooling ) .",
    "we assumed here , that the 0.1  @xmath7 m grains are responsible for the gas - grain cooling , not the small pahs .    in the model without pahs , the lower part of the `` hot finger '' is still present ( fig .",
    "[ tdusttgas_nopah ] ) . in this part ,",
    "pe heating is not the dominant heating process and hence the omission of pahs does not change the overall picture . mainly , h@xmath2 formation heating is balanced by h@xmath2 ro - vibrational line cooling and gas - grain collisions . hence",
    ", the resulting gas temperature is the same as in the standard model .",
    "however , the upper layers of the disk without pahs are much cooler than in the standard model .",
    "[ c@xmath0 ] 158  @xmath7 m line cooling is now the dominant cooling process inwards of @xmath74  au .",
    "interestingly , the gas temperature drops as one gets closer to the star .",
    "this seems at first glance counterintuitive , because the strength of the radiation field increases and therefore one would expect a stronger pe heating rate @xmath75 however , the pe heating efficiency @xmath76 drops in the absence of pahs much faster than @xmath77 and thus the heating rate becomes smaller .",
    "the ism grains , which are rather large compared to the pahs , become strongly charged in the presence of high uv radiation fields .",
    "therefore it becomes more difficult for an electron to escape the grain and actually heat the gas . in the model with pahs ,",
    "the slope of the pe heating efficiency is much flatter , because the pahs , which are actually large molecules , are less charged than the ism grains .",
    "[ chem ] illustrates the abundances of the most important atoms and molecules in the disk .",
    "the h / h@xmath2 transition occurs well above the warm disk surface layer .",
    "the same holds for the c@xmath0/c / co transition .",
    "interestingly , the hot finger is almost devoid of h@xmath2 , because it is chemically destroyed at high temperatures . at low a@xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , h@xmath2 is photodissociated , but deeper in the disk , the uv radiation is efficiently shielded and h@xmath2 is mainly destroyed via collisions with first h - atoms and then o atoms , leading to the formation of h and oh . the latter is subsequently photodissociated into its atomic components . hence , h@xmath2 is destroyed chemically and not via direct photodissociation by stellar uv photons .",
    "there exists a region in our model , where the co photodissociation front lies at the same a@xmath78 than the h@xmath2 dissociation front ( see fig .  [ 20auslice]b ) . leaving out",
    "the pahs does not change the resulting chemical structure of the model .",
    "an interesting feature is the `` hot finger '' region , which shows a very high abundance of oh . similarly , there are intermediate layers in the disk atmosphere , where ch and ch@xmath2 show an abundance maximum .",
    "although these layers do not contain a lot of disk mass , they may still be observable .",
    "the column densities of co , ch , and ch@xmath2 are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82  @xmath49 at a distance of 100  au for the standard model .",
    "the disk atmosphere contains a significant amount of gas in molecular form .",
    "the high temperature of this gas might help to excite e.g.  molecules such as h@xmath2 , which would otherwise not be observable .",
    "given the gas temperatures derived for the disk model with pahs , hi will evaporate from the upper disk layers .",
    "its thermal velocity @xmath83 in the standard model is large enough to overcome gravity .",
    "however , it exceeds the escape velocity @xmath84 only marginally .",
    "@xmath85 is here the gravitational constant , @xmath86 the stellar mass and @xmath87 the distance from the star .",
    "[ evap ] shows the region , where hydrogen gas can escape given the rather conservative criterium @xmath88 @xmath89 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath90 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the thermal velocities @xmath91 of the heavier elements are smaller than the escape velocity and they could only escape if they are entrained with the evaporating hydrogen flow . given a collision rate @xmath92 , their mean free path @xmath93 in a hydrogen flow is @xcite @xmath94 @xmath95 is the masses of the heavy element , @xmath96 is the bohr radius , and @xmath97 is the hydrogen particle density . assuming the minimum density from our models , 5000  @xmath55 in the surrounding medium , we find that the maximum free path for an oxygen atom is @xmath98  au .",
    "although the mean free path of the heavy elements is rather small , the force acting on these particles is smaller than gravity .    firm conclusions on the possibility of evaporation can only be drawn from dynamical calculations , which account for additional forces like the pressure gradient and centrifugal term .",
    "the deviation from keplerian velocity is approximated as @xmath99 @xcite , where @xmath100 is the keplerian frequency , @xmath101 the sound speed , and @xmath102 the gas mass density .",
    "although @xmath103 is rather small in the cold disk midplane , the warm disk surface ( @xmath104  k ) will rotate substantially subkeplerian , @xmath105 .",
    "this may also give rise to shear instability .",
    "same as fig .",
    "[ fig - dnz02-slice ] , but now the light area indicates the the region , from which hydrogen gas can escape the standard disk model.,width=340 ]    it should however be kept in mind , that there is some uncertainty in the gas temperature due to the atomic data that enters the cooling line calculations and the rather simple fitting formulas used for the heating processes .",
    "however , @xcite have recently shown that the evaporation flow starts indeed already at subsonic velocities . in our case",
    ", this would mean that the evaporation would start deeper in the disk , leading to a much higher mass loss rate .",
    "the uncertainty in the gas temperature will then be less important , because rather than switching from non - evaporation to evaporation , the mass loss process would be rather smooth and differ only in its efficiency . in the model without pahs , the gas temperature is generally lower and disk evaporation is thus less effective .",
    "we find that the dust and gas temperature in protoplanetary disks around t tauri stars are well coupled up to the location of the ` superheated surface layer ' where the dust emission features are produced .",
    "this means that for models aimed at predicting dust continuum emission from protoplanetary disks , the assumption of equal gas and dust temperature is probably not too far from the truth .    at radii smaller than 50  au",
    ", the gas temperature can reach values of @xmath106 k above the disk photosphere .",
    "first estimates indicate that at least hydrogen can evaporate from the disk surface . to verify this ,",
    "an iteration procedure is required , in which the resulting gas temperature structure is inserted into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , yielding a new density structure , which then feeds back into the chemistry - heating - cooling model .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we can nevertheless speculate on the consequences of such an iteration given the results of our present model : in the upper layers of the innermost disk regions , @xmath107  au , the gas temperature depends hardly on density . therefore , we do not expect our gas temperature structure to change a lot in these regions , if the feedback on the disk structure would be taken into account ( more flaring in the outer parts and hence a different density structure ) .",
    "but at larger radii , @xmath108  au , the `` hot finger '' and hence the evaporating region , could vanish if the density structure of the disk changes .",
    "it is especially interesting to note the importance of pahs on the resulting gas temperature structure of the upper disk atmosphere .",
    "pahs are a significant heating source in the uppermost layers .",
    "the presence of pahs in the calculations presented here is necessary for the possibility of disk evaporation .",
    "it does , however , not lead to significant changes in the chemical structure of the model .    above the superheated surface layer ,",
    "the dust and the gas thermally decouple .",
    "some molecular species , such as h@xmath2 , co , ch , ch@xmath2 , oh , probe the very upper layers of the disk , in the region where the gas temperature has already decoupled from the dust . in order to make reliable predictions for these molecular lines , a detailed gas temperature and molecular abundance calculation of the kind presented here is important .",
    "@xcite found strong increases , up to a factor 10 , in the [ oi ] and [ cii ] fine structure line fluxes , due to different excitation conditions in the disk models with a detailed calculation of the gas temperature .",
    "the accuracy of the gas temperature determination is extremely difficult to assess , especially given the fact that atomic and molecular collision cross sections are often poorly known at high temperatures and our limited knowledge of the grain composition and size in these disks .",
    "there are e.g.  only very few direct detections of pahs in t tauri disks .",
    "it is very important for the models to seek for input from the observations .",
    "instruments like visir at the vlt have the high resolution ( @xmath109 ) that is necessary to pick up the narrow gas lines from these disks . if such gas line observations would reveal the presence of an extremely hot disk surface layer , we might have an indirect evidence for the presence of pahs in disks around t tauri stars .",
    "in this paper we have always assumed that the dust and the gas are well - mixed , i.e.  that the dust has not settled toward lower elevations above the midplane . in reality , however , in the very surface layers of the disk , this settling process takes place on a very short time scale . at 10 au , for instance , a dust grain of 0.1 @xmath7 m settles below the initial photospheric height @xmath6 in less than 10@xmath110 years",
    "a detailed study of the consequences that this settling process has on the appearance of the disk has been given recently by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in press ) .",
    "in future work this process will have to be included into the present model , in order to study the effect of dust settling on the temperature structure of the disk .    finally , some short speculations on the dynamical consequences of our gas temperature results : the strong temperature gradients , especially above the hot finger , suggest that convective instabilities might occur .",
    "material expanding into the upper layers of the disk atmosphere will encounter a steep negative temperature gradient that might exceed the adiabatic one .",
    "in addition , these strong temperature gradients could also give rise to shear instabilities .",
    "such convective and shear instabilities could lead to additional mixing , especially in the upper layers of the disk , where one would like to keep the small dust grains .",
    "we are grateful to ewine van dishoeck and bastiaan jonkheid for a detailed comparison of our codes and numerous discussions on the details of thermal balance calculations .",
    "we acknowledge also the fruitful discussions on this topic taking place during an ongoing detailed comparison of several pdr codes .",
    "furthermore , we would like to thank david hollenbach and doug lin for interesting discussions on the dynamical consequences of these models during a workshop on protoplanetary disks held at ringberg castle .",
    "an anonymous referee helped us to improve the perspicuity of the paper significantly .",
