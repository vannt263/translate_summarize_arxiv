    "vertical pillar quantum dots exhibit an extremely wide range of interesting physics , particularly in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the dot @xcite .",
    "the coulomb blockade allows single electrons to be added to the dot so the number of electrons can be set precisely , starting from one . for each number of electrons",
    "the ground state evolves through a series of transitions as the magnetic field is increased . at zero magnetic field",
    "the ground states are well described by hund s first rule and maximum density droplet ( mdd ) states occur when the field is increased to a few tesla .",
    "finally , fractional quantum hall droplet and electron molecule states occur at high fields beyond about 10 t .",
    "so , roughly speaking , there are four regimes but the detailed picture is much richer .",
    "many transitions occur in between each of the main regimes and each transition is accompanied by abrupt changes in the spin and orbital angular momentum of the ground state .",
    "there is experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence that these effects occur .",
    "however it is difficult to apply experimental techniques , like scanning tunnelling spectroscopy , to probe the corresponding quantum states directly .",
    "instead the ground state quantum numbers are found by comparing data from transport spectroscopy with calculated results .",
    "this requires an accurate dot model that can be used to analyse data for an _ individual _ quantum dot .",
    "development of an appropriate model is the purpose of the present work .",
    "although quantum dots are often described as artificial atoms , there is a very important difference between an artificial atom and a natural one : all natural atoms of the same isotope are identical but all quantum dots are different .",
    "this makes it quite challenging to model an individual dot accurately , even when its basic design parameters are known , because manufacturing tolerances introduce fluctuations in the parameters and this can have a significant influence on dot states . the fact that the dot often consists of a small region embedded in a much larger device structure just adds to the difficulty of constructing an accurate model .",
    "the ideal model of an electrostatic quantum dot is a system in which electrons are constrained to move in the two dimensions parallel to the dot plane , are confined by a parabolic potential and interact via the coulomb interaction .",
    "the properties of this model have been examined extensively , see @xcite for a review .",
    "it gives a good qualitative description of dot behaviour but a more accurate model is needed for data analysis .",
    "one possibility is a device model in which the dot confining potential and in some cases the interaction potential are computed , together with the quantum states , from a combined solution of the poisson and schrdinger equations .",
    "this approach has been used by many authors , @xcite for example , and has given a great deal of insight into the generic behaviour of devices containing quantum dots .",
    "however , it is extremely difficult to use generic device models to deduce ground state quantum numbers from experimental data for an _ individual _ quantum dot .",
    "one of the difficulties encountered in analysing individual dot data is that energies have to be computed to very high precision .",
    "the quantity measured experimentally is the gate voltage at which transport occurs .",
    "this is proportional to the chemical potential , @xmath0 which is the difference of two dot energies : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy of the an @xmath3-electron dot state .",
    "further , the transport data is often presented as a difference between the gate voltages for two successive current peaks .",
    "this gives the addition energy , @xmath4 , the second difference of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "because energy differences are needed to compare theoretical results with experimental data the energies themselves must be computed very accurately .",
    "typically , the addition energy is around 3 mev while typical dot energies are one or two orders of magnitude larger so that high precision values of the dot energy are needed for data analysis .",
    "however the potentials found in generic dot models depend on many parameters , dot dimensions , dopant densities etc , some of which are not known accurately . in principle",
    ", these parameters could be adjusted to fit the data but it is desirable to avoid fitting a large number of parameters .",
    "the present model lies between the parabolic confinement , coulomb interaction model and the generic device models .",
    "the main idea is to develop a model that contains all the essential physics but depends on a small number of adjustable parameters .",
    "three are used in the present work but it turns out that one of them is not very significant .",
    "the model is a parabolic confinement model , believed to be accurate for small numbers of electrons @xcite .",
    "two of the parameters determine the parabolic potential but only one of them is significant .",
    "the interaction potential is determined from a simplified device structure .",
    "the effects of finite thickness and screening on the interaction in this structure are included fully and a third model parameter is used to determine the screening .",
    "essentially , the resulting model reduces to a two - dimensional , parabolic confinement model with an interaction potential that is very different from the bare coulomb potential .",
    "the model gives an excellent description of addition energy data , accurate to about 0.15 mev .",
    "it has already been used to determine the ground state spin and orbital angular momentum of a pillar dot in the strong magnetic field regime @xcite .",
    "however ref .",
    "@xcite does not contain the detailed explanation of the model and analysis procedures that is given here .",
    "the model is described in section [ modelsection ] and the method used to calculate the quantum states is detailed in section [ calcsection ] . following this ,",
    "parameter fitting procedures for experimental addition energy and chemical potential data are discussed in section [ fitsection ] .",
    "then the application of the model to data in the low and high magnetic field regimes is described in section [ resultssection ] and conclusions are stated in section [ concsection ]",
    ". finally , two appendices deal with the calculation of green s functions and interaction matrix elements needed to find the quantum states .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    a vertical pillar dot ( fig .",
    "[ dotfig ] , top frame ) consists of a narrow pillar , typically 500 nm in diameter @xcite .",
    "the pillar contains a double barrier heterostructure ( dbh ) which provides confinement in the vertical ( @xmath5 ) direction and is surrounded by a cylindrical metal gate which carries a negative charge that provides lateral ( @xmath6 ) confinement .",
    "the pillar stands on a substrate which is heavily doped and there is also a heavily doped region at the top of the pillar .",
    "these heavily doped regions provide source and drain contacts that enable the transport properties of the device to be investigated .",
    "a unique advantage of the vertical geometry is that it is not sensitive to edge states which affect transport through lateral devices in the high magnetic field regime .    in a typical experiment ,",
    "the source - drain current is measured as a function of the gate voltage , @xmath7 , source - drain voltage , @xmath8 and magnetic field , @xmath9 parallel to the pillar .",
    "typical results @xcite are shown in the bottom frame of fig .",
    "[ dotfig ] .",
    "this image shows the condition for an electron to enter the dot at fixed source drain bias .",
    "it is well known that transport through the device is coulomb blockaded except at certain values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ dotfig ] the current is colour coded so that dark regions correspond to the largest current .",
    "the @xmath3th dark curve shows how the gate voltage needed for the @xmath3th electron to enter the dot depends on the magnetic field .",
    "the lowest curve in the figure corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "the exact condition for electron transport is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the contact chemical potential , @xmath13 is the gate voltage at which the @xmath3th electron enters the dot and @xmath14 is an electrostatic leverage factor . at zero source drain bias",
    "this reduces to @xmath15 so that the gate voltage at which transport occurs is a measure of the dot chemical potential relative to the contact . for transport data in the form of a gate voltage difference , @xmath16 is proportional to the addition energy , @xmath4 if @xmath14 and @xmath12 are independent of @xmath3 . hence the first and second differences of the dot energies are needed to compare theory with experiment .",
    "the dot model takes account of vertical confinement , lateral confinement and interactions between dot electrons .",
    "the quantum well between the double barriers is relatively narrow ( 12 nm ) so the electrons are confined to the ground state of the vertical motion .",
    "this leads to a quasi - two - dimensional model in which the interaction is modified by the vertical confinement , physically the effect is to smear out the coulomb singularity .",
    "the lateral confinement is generated by the cylindrical side gate and in principle the lateral confinement potential may be found by solving the poisson equation , refs .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "however in the present case , @xmath3 is small so the spatial extent of the dot state ( @xmath17 nm ) is very small compared to the pillar diameter ( @xmath18 nm ) .",
    "therefore the only part of the confining potential that has a significant effect on the dot electrons is the part near the minimum which is parabolic .",
    "in addition , observation of shell structure in the device considered here @xcite shows that the device has a high degree of circular symmetry . the lateral confining potential is therefore taken to be @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the lateral radial co - ordinate and @xmath21 is found from @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are fitting parameters .",
    "the constant @xmath25 is not needed for the present analysis because the addition energy is independent of @xmath25 and the chemical potential is also independent of @xmath25 when @xmath0 taken relative to @xmath26 .",
    "previous work has shown that the parabolic approximation is consistent with experiment @xcite and accurate for small numbers of electrons @xcite , that is electrons in the first and second shells at @xmath27 .",
    "the screening is mainly caused by heavily doped contacts that are relatively close to the dot , around 10 nm from the well .",
    "this is close enough for the contact regions to have a significant screening effect on the interaction between the dot electrons .",
    "this is treated in the thomas - fermi approximation and the screening length in the contact region is taken to be a fitting parameter .",
    "full details of the present approach to screening and finite thickness are given in the following two sections .",
    "the dot is three dimensional but when the electrons are confined to the vertical ground state their motion is quasi - two - dimensional .",
    "a variational method is used to find the resulting effective hamiltonian . in principle",
    "this needs two steps .",
    "the envelope function for the vertical confinement should be found first and then the spin splitting should be found from this envelope function @xcite .",
    "however the second step is not needed here because the experimental value of the effective @xmath28-factor for the present device is known . except for the spin splitting terms ,",
    "the 3d effective mass hamiltonian is @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the lateral momentum , @xmath32 is the magnetic vector potential , @xmath33 is the vertical momentum , @xmath34 is the barrier height , @xmath35 is a step function , @xmath36 when @xmath37 , @xmath38 otherwise , @xmath39 is the well width , @xmath40 when @xmath5 is in the well and @xmath41 when @xmath5 is in the barrier .",

    "equations for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are found by minimising @xmath47 subject to the constraint that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are normalised .",

    "after eqs .",
    "( [ eigeneq2 ] ) have been solved the total energy is found from the expectation value of the full hamiltonian : @xmath59    in principle , the coupled eigenvalue problem defined by eqs .",

    "the energy difference term @xmath60/n$ ] in the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eigeneq2 ] ) in the present case is around 1% of the barrier height .",
    "hence the effect of this term is small and it is sufficient to find @xmath46 from the zeroth - order approximation in which the energy difference term is neglected and then use the zeroth - order @xmath46 to find the averaged hamiltonian @xmath61 .",
    "the averaging has two physical effects .",
    "first , it changes the effective mass .",
    "the dot considered here is made from ingaas containing 5% in , and the in reduces the mass . the barrier is made from algaas containing 22% al and this increases the mass .",
    "the net effect is to reduce the mass to @xmath62 , slightly less than the gaas value .",
    "the second effect of the averaging is to smear out the coulomb singularity in the effective two - dimensional interaction .",
    "this results from the integral over @xmath5 in the first of eqs .",
    "( [ hdefs ] ) .",
    "the averaging procedure also applies to systems with spin - orbit coupling . in this case",
    ", it is found that the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling parameter has to be averaged in a way similar to the effective mass .",
    "this has been used for studies of spin relaxation in the present device @xcite .",
    "the final step in determining the effective hamiltonian is to find the spin splitting .",
    "the effective @xmath28-factor , @xmath63 , is determined from the experimentally observed zeeman splitting @xcite in the same device that is used for the data analysis performed here .",
    "@xmath64 for the dot when @xmath65 t , compared with @xmath66 for bulk gaas .",
    "the reduced value for the dot is consistent with the effect of non - parabolicity @xcite .",
    "the non - parabolicity also makes the effective @xmath28-factor depend on magnetic field and landau level index @xcite but the resulting corrections to @xmath0 are probably smaller than experimental error .",
    "a constant @xmath28-factor is therefore used and the zeeman energy is accounted for by adding @xmath67 to the total energy in eq .  [ etot ] . here",
    "@xmath68 is the bohr magneton and @xmath69 is the @xmath5 component of the total spin @xmath70 .",
    "the effective @xmath28-factor is assumed to be negative , as in bulk gaas , so @xmath71 .",
    "the most important source of screening in the present device is the heavily doped contacts above and below the dot .",
    "the dielectric response of the disordered contact material is not well understood but can be treated approximately in the static thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "this allows the screening length to be estimated from the density of states at the fermi level , however this is not known accurately for the contact material .",
    "hence the screening length is taken to be a fitting parameter which is determined from experimental data .",
    "the screened interaction between dot electrons @xcite is found from the electrostatic green s function @xmath72 which satisfies @xmath73 & = & -q_0 ^ 2 ( { \\bf r } ) \\epsilon({\\bf r } ) \\epsilon_0 g({\\bf r},{\\bf r } ' ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r } ' ) , \\label{3dgreen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the relative permittivity , @xmath75 inside the contacts , @xmath76 outside the contacts and @xmath77 . because a detailed theory of magnetic field dependent screening by the 3d contact material is not available",
    ", the screening length , @xmath78 , is taken to be independent of the magnetic field .",
    "this approximation should be good when the screening length does not change significantly over the field range used in the experiments and it is assumed that this is the case .",
    "( [ 3dgreen ] ) is simplified by making use of the fact that the dot is an order of magnitude smaller than the pillar .",
    "this means that the green s function is almost translationally invariant in the lateral direction and can be found to a good approximation by replacing the pillar by a stack of dielectric layers of infinite extent in the lateral directions . @xmath79 and @xmath80 then do not depend on @xmath81 .",
    "so the green s function is translationally invariant in the lateral directions and can be expressed as a fourier transform : @xmath82 the fourier components of the green s function satisfy @xmath83 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\epsilon(z)\\epsilon_0 [ q^2 + q^2_0(z)]g({q},z , z ' ) = \\delta(z - z ' ) .",

    "( [ gfform ] ) , is used to simplify this integral so that it can be evaluated efficiently .",
    "details are given appendix b. the form of the effective interaction in real space is very different from a pure coulomb interaction . because of the screening , the interaction is dipole - like at long range and decreases like @xmath93 in the limit of large @xmath20 . and the coulomb singularity is removed by the finite thickness because the electrons are able to move out of the dot plane and avoid each other . the real - space effective interaction as a function of @xmath20",

    "the effect of the dielectric interfaces in the device on the effective interaction is accounted for fully in the green s function formalism .",
    "in addition , the dielectric interfaces have an effect on the vertical confinement potential .",
    "this results from the interaction of each electron with its own image charges and is also accounted for in the green s function formalism . the image charge contribution to the vertical confinement is obtained from the non - singular part of the green s function @xcite and in the present case the image charge contribution is @xmath104 d{q},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 when @xmath5 is in the well , @xmath106 , the barrier relative permittivity , when @xmath5 is in the barrier and @xmath107 when @xmath5 is at the interface between the well and the barrier .",
    "the image charge term leads to a small change in the vertical confinement which is taken into account via perturbation theory .",
    "another source of screening in the present device is the metallic , cylindrical side gate . in principle",

    "the effect is clearly largest for electrons at the edge of the dot but the interaction between these electrons and electrons in the centre of the dot is suppressed by the screening effect of the contacts .",
    "these considerations suggest that the effect of the gate is small for the small electron numbers considered here ( @xmath110 )",

    "this can be done by rejecting features that do not depend on @xmath3 @xcite , for example .",
    "however the excitation lines in fig .",
    "[ excfig ] have gaps and are of variable intensity so the present quantitative comparison is based on features like level crossings and crossings of excitation lines with the upper boundaries of the excitation stripes .",

    "there are ground state transitions in the 4 - 5 t interval in both the theory and experiment and an excited state line is visible in the experimental data .",
    "this probably corresponds to line ( c ) in the theory . in the case of 4 electrons",
    "there are ground state transitions ( d ) and ( e ) in both theory and experiment .",
    "in addition , an excited state line which has a flat maximum is present in the experimental data .",
    "this corresponds to the crossing ( h ) in the theory but small symmetry breaking effects such as disorder change the crossing into an anticrossing and lead to a maximum in the experimental data .",
    "the second excited state line ( f - g ) is also clearly visible in both the theory and experiment . for 5 electrons",
    "the ground state transition ( j ) has the distinctive form of a maximum and is clearly present in both theory and experiment , and some short excited state lines emerge from this crossing .",
    "further , for both 4 and 5 electrons the experimental ground state line is broadened in the regions between 4 and 5 t. this corresponds to the region where the theory predicts that ground and excited state levels cluster together and excitation gaps shrink .",
    "although the agreement is generally good , there are some discrepancies .",
    "for @xmath10 the theory predicts no excitations within the 2 mev window at fields below 5 t but there is some structure in the experimental data .",

    "this discrepancy is thought to be a consequence of the thermal cycling since the positions of the singlet - triplet transition agree well in the addition energy data , fig  [ addfig2 ] .",
    "the excited state line of the 3-electron system ( c ) is difficult to identify because it is not clear whether it extends as far as the excitation boundary in the experimental data .",

    "the experimental excitation energy is compared with the theoretical second excited state energy at the arbitrarily chosen field of 3 t in table  [ exctab ] ( feature ( c ) ) .",

    "although the three - dimensional device structure is accounted for , the resulting physical model reduces to one in which electron motion is restricted to the two lateral dimensions , the confinement is parabolic and the interaction potential differs significantly from the bare coulomb potential .",
    "the model only contains 3 adjustable parameters . of these the parameter that describes the @xmath3 dependence of the confinement energy",
    "does not appear to be significant over the small @xmath3 range considered here and it is likely that a two parameter model would give similar accuracy to the present one . for dots with larger @xmath3 it would be possible to include non - parabolic confinement .",
    "this would increase the number of model parameters but with larger @xmath3 there would be more data so the additional parameters could probably be determined reliably .",
    "although the model parameters are determined by fitting ground state data , the model is able to give a good description of the low lying excited states .",
    "the model energies agree with experiment to about 10 - 20% and the positions of features in magnetic field dependent data agree to similar accuracy .",
    "one of the factors limiting the accuracy of the present analysis is uncertainty in the value of the electrostatic leverage factor @xmath14 .",
    "accurate measurements of @xmath14 would enhance the scope and applicability of the present analysis .",
    "the general approach described here is not limited to vertical pillar dots . in principle",
    ", similar analysis procedures could be developed for any type of dot , provided a good physical model is available .",

    "the functions @xmath85 and @xmath28 and the wronskian @xmath86 ( eq .  [ gfform ] ) are needed to find the green s function . to find @xmath85 and @xmath28",
    "the system is divided into thin slices , such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constant in each slice . in the present case",
    "this simply means that each layer of the structure is sub - divided into thin slices but the same numerical procedure is applicable to any form of @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath124th slice occupies the region between @xmath125 and @xmath126 and is characterised by a relative permittivity @xmath127 , @xmath128 value @xmath129 and a thickness @xmath130 . within each slice @xmath85 and",
    "@xmath28 have the form @xmath131 .",
    "the two terms in this expression are analogous to evanescent waves in diffraction theory and it is convenient to use the language of diffraction theory to describe them . thus the reflected wave , @xmath132 which decays in the positive @xmath5 direction has the form @xmath133 .",
    "similarly , the transmitted wave , @xmath134 which decays in the negative @xmath5 direction has the form @xmath135 .",
    "the amplitudes at successive slices are related via a transfer matrix , @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are amplitudes just below the interface at @xmath126 , that is within the slice of relative permittivity @xmath127 .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath91 are used to find the elements of the transfer matrix : @xmath28 and @xmath139 are continuous and the same holds for @xmath85 .",
    "therefore @xmath140    it is well known that direct application of eq .",
    "( [ tmatdef ] ) is numerically unstable .",
    "instead it is necessary to compute the ratio @xmath141 which corresponds to the reflection coefficient at each interface @xcite .",
    "the notation used here is similar to that of ref .",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath142 satisfies @xmath143 where the @xmath144 are the elements of the transfer matrix ( eq .  ( [ tmatvals ] ) ) for going across the interface at @xmath126 to the interface at @xmath145 .",
    "( [ rstep ] ) can be used to step @xmath142 provided that the denominator of the fraction is not small .",
    "if the denominator does become small an alternative relation can be used to step @xmath146 @xcite but this was not needed for the present work .",
    "the procedure for finding @xmath28 is as follows .",
    "deep inside the bottom contact @xmath28 decays exponentially so the only component present is @xmath138 .",
    "hence @xmath142 is found from eq .",
    "( [ rstep ] ) starting from @xmath147 .",
    "once @xmath142 is known @xmath148 is found from the relations @xmath149 which follow from eq .",
    "( [ tmatdef ] ) and the definitions of @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "( [ tstep ] ) is applied with the initial condition @xmath150 , where the topmost slice ends at @xmath151 .",
    "this procedure corresponds directly to the one used in diffraction theory .",
    "the procedure used to find @xmath85 is slightly different .",
    "@xmath85 is required to decay exponentially deep inside the top contact , that is , it only has a reflected component there .",
    "this means that the inverse reflection coefficient @xmath152 vanishes deep inside the top contact .",
    "hence it is convenient to re - expresss eqs .",
    "( [ rstep ] ) and ( [ tstep ] ) in terms of the inverse transfer matrix defined by @xmath153 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are amplitudes just below the interface at @xmath125 , again within the slice of relative permittivity @xmath127 .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath91 lead to expressions for the inverse transfer matrix elements : @xmath154 the inverse reflection coefficient satisfies @xmath155 and this relation is used to step @xmath156 , starting from the initial condition @xmath157 . here",
    "the notation @xmath158 is used to emphasise that @xmath20 and @xmath158 are computed with different initial conditions so @xmath159 is _ not _ the inverse of @xmath20 .",
    "once @xmath156 is known , @xmath160 is found from the relations @xmath161 with the initial condition @xmath162 .",
    "the wronskian @xmath86 is independent of @xmath5 and can be evaluated at any convenient position .",
    "this requires @xmath85 , @xmath28 and their derivatives .",
    "the derivatives are found from @xmath163 together with a similar expression for @xmath164 .",
    "this leads to @xmath165 which is valid away from dielectric interfaces .",
    "the relations given here have been found to be numerically stable for the device considered in the present work .",
    "but in general it is possible for the calculation of the wronskian to underflow , causing overflow in the calculation of the green s function .",
    "however this is only likely to be a problem for very thick systems and where underflow could result from the exponential form of @xmath85 and @xmath28 .",
    "the fourier components of the effective interaction are found from eq .",
    "( [ u2dqdef ] ) .",
    "the form factor is @xmath166 except for a factor of @xmath167 , the integral in this equation has the form @xmath168 to evaluate this integral numerically it is convenient to define @xmath169 then @xmath170 is evaluated recursively from @xmath171 and the required integral is found from @xmath172",
    "the advantage of this approach is that only a few operations are needed to update @xmath170 . as a result",
    "the computer time scaling is linear with the number of integration steps instead of quadratic as would be the case if the integral in eq .",
    "( [ doubleint ] ) was evaluated directly .",
    "the approach is simple to implement on a uniform grid .",
    "however a uniform grid can not be used in the present case because the system contains interfaces where the relative permittivity changes abruptly and it is necessary to ensure that the grid points coincide with these interfaces .",
    "this is done by adjusting the step length within each region of constant relative permittivity . as a result",
    "the step length is constant within each region but the step length varies from region to region . to apply the approach to the resulting non - uniform grid the following generalisation of simpson s rule",
    "is used : @xmath173 where @xmath174 are chosen so that the integration rule is exact for @xmath175 and @xmath176 and @xmath177 are step lengths .",
