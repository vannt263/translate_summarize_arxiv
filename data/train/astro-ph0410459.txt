    "classical novae are a subset of cataclysmic variables which are interacting binary systems hosting a main - sequence secondary ( sometimes a slightly evolved star ) and a collapsed primary component , a white dwarf ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "an outburst on the surface of the white dwarf as a result of a thermonuclear runaway in the accreted material causes the ejection of 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 of material at velocities up to several thousand kilometers per second ( shara 1989 ; warner 1995 ) .",

    "in addition , a total of 105 frames in the @xmath14 band and 87 frames in the @xmath13 band have been compiled for comparison ( in 2003 november 1 - 2 ; in 2003 december 28 ) .",
    "after the raw data are cleaned and calibrated , the instrumental magnitudes of the nova are derived by the psf fitting algorithms daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and allstar in the midas software package ( version 02febpl1.0 and 03febpl1.0 ) using 25 stars as psf stars .",
    "also , another reference group of four constant stars close to the nova in the same field is formed in order to reduce the scintillation effects and to derive the relative magnitudes .",
    "the calibrated apparent magnitude of the nova in the r band varied in the range from 15@xmath11.1 to 16@xmath11.2 in 2002 .",

    "several standard programs have been used like the scargle algorithim ( scargle 1982 ) and discrete fourier analysis using leahy normalization ( leahy et al .",

    "we presented 14 nights of data on v2275 cyg obtained with the tug 1.5 m telescope using mainly standard @xmath0 filters in 2002 and 2003 .",
    "we discover large modulations @xmath23=0.42 at p@xmath1=0.31449(15 ) d in the light curve of the classical nova in 2002 and the amplitude of this modulation decrease to @xmath23=0.22 in 2003 .",
    "this period is discovered in the @xmath13 and the @xmath14 band as well .",
    "since the periodicity is persistent and coherent , we propose that this is the binary period of the system .",
    "the orbital period can be detected as a result of the aspect variations of the secondary due to heating from the hot wd ( kovetz , prialnik , @xmath24 shara 1988 ) .",
    "the decrease in the modulation depth from 2002 to 2003 and the color variations ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath25 ) support a scenario where the heated secondary is the source of the light and the color variation rather than a hot spot on the disk .",
    "the mass - period relation m@xmath2@xmath260.11p@xmath27 ( warner 1995 ) yields a secondary mass of about 0.83 m@xmath5 for v2275 cyg using the discovered binary period in this paper , which is in accordance with the fact that a massive secondary will be hot and prone to irradiation effects .",
    "in addition , the mean light curves ( fig . 6 and 7 ) indicate an asymmetry in the r band as would be expected from the differential rotation of the secondary spreading the heated atmosphere into a nonspherical shape ( tear - drop model ) .",
    "an eclipse can be ruled out because the modulation amplitude would be larger in time as observed for some other novae ( e.g. , v838 her : leibowitz et al .",
    "1992 , v1494 aql : kato et al .",
    "2004 ) . a recent search for variations / periodicities in the light curve of",
    "faint cvs ( including old novae ) reveals that irradiation yields larger amplitude for modulations ( woudt @xmath24 warner 2003a , b ) as detected in our study .    after a nova explosion , the hot wds are candidates for heating their cooler companion",
    "some classical nova systems were recovered to show this irradiation effect like : ( 1 ) v1500 cyg ( n cyg 1975 ) which showed an unperturbed temperature of 3000 k for the secondary and 8000 k for the heated side ( schmidt et al .",
    "1995 ; somers @xmath24 naylor 1999 ) ; ( 2 ) dn gem ( n gem 1912 ) ( retter , leibowitz @xmath24 naylor 1999 ) ; ( 3 ) wy sge ( n sge 1783 ) which indicated that the accretion luminosity from the disk could even be responsible for the irradiation of the secondary ( somers , ringwald @xmath24 naylor 1997 ) .",
    "however , only one of such systems resemble v2275 cyg closely : orbital modulations due to aspect variations of the heated face of the secondary was detected for nova cygni 1992 ( v1974 cyg ) at the outburst stage ( about a year and a half after outburst ) by deyoung @xmath24 schmidt ( 1994 ) before the wd cooled to a point where it was no longer a strong x - ray source .",
    "the orbital variations in v1974 cyg were @xmath280.1 in the @xmath14 band and @xmath290.05 in the @xmath13 band when the h - burning had just turned - off ( the wd temperature was about 3 - 4@xmath15 10@xmath30 k ; balman et al .",
    "v1974 cyg was discovered as a super soft x - ray source ( sss ) while burning the hydrogen over its surface ( balman et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) consistent with the fact that most novae are expected to be a sss at a certain point during their outburst stage ( see krautter 2002 for a review ) . a hot wd at a temperature above 1@xmath1510@xmath30 k ( i.e. , emits mostly in the soft x - ray wavelengths ) with a radiative wind can be the source of an ionization front irradiating the secondary star .",
    "therefore , we suggest that v2275 cyg was also a sss during 2002 - 2003 , and the radiative winds / ionization front of a sss reaching out well into the photosphere of the secondary , can explain the observations of v2275 cyg in 2002 .",
    "the decrease of 50@xmath17 in the modulation depth from 2002 to 2003 is another indication of the changing conditions in the ionization front .",
    "the strong third harmonic of p@xmath1 detected in 2003 could support the existence of several hot zones over the total surface of the secondary along with the significantly heated inner face resulting in the higher harmonics becoming prominent .",
    "we also detected another periodicity p@xmath2=0.017079(17 ) d in the light curve of 2003 .",
    "we suggest that this is a highly coherent qpo from the system .",
    "the power of the signal varies on different nights ( independent of length of the observation together with the small changes of the periodicity which differ according to the color ( i.e. , filter ) .",
    "the characteristics of the oscillations revealed in 2003 does not strongly support a wd - spin period as the origin .",
    "the timescale and characteristics of the qpos ( @xmath281475 s ) resemble flickering , or reprocessing from blobs orbiting within the inner regions / magnetosphere of the accretion disk in accreting cvs .",
    "it could also be the beat period between the spin period and the orbital period of the system ( p@xmath1 ) . however , since the nova is still in its early outburst stage during the tug observations , it is not clear whether the disk is completely disrupted , or if re - established , the accretion is steady , sporadic or unstable .",
    "for example , the existence of an accretion disk was revealed in v1974 cyg two years after the outburst ( retter et .",
    "al 1997 ) which was long after the discovery of the variations due to irradiation of the secondary",
    ".    there have been recent detections of oscillations in classical nova systems of about 2500 s ( v1494 aql : drake et al .",
    "2003 ) and @xmath28 1300 s ( v4743 sgr : ness et al .",
    "2003 ) in the x - ray wavelengths .",
    "these oscillations are attributed to expected wd pulsations ( i.e. , nonradial nonadiabatic modes ) from the @xmath281.5@xmath15 10@xmath30 k and l@xmath282000l@xmath5 , hot wds ( starrfield et al .",
    "the p@xmath2 detected in v2275 cyg is similar to these in timescale .",
    "however , it is expected that the higher luminosity ( a factor of 10 ) and the temperature ( a factor of 4 - 5 ) of the wds , as the h is burned over the surface , should decrease the pulsational timescale ( starrfield et al .",
    "1985 ) , which makes this scenario unfavorable for v2275 cyg .",
    "in addition , the 2002 data set should have revealed the same oscillations , if they were solely due to wd pulsations .",
    "a more plausible explanation for the origin of p@xmath2 is , yet again , the effect of an ionization front ( if ) resulting from an alleged sss phase and the radiative winds of the wd in the outburst stage .",
    "if the if reaches well into the photosphere of the secondary , favorable conditions could result in ionization over the face of the secondary ( if penetrates photosphere ) resulting in `` boiling off '' ( may be `` ripping off '' ) material from a dense static / neutral medium which could be the case in 2002 .",
    "if if does not reach as far as the photosphere , it could still reach out below the inner lagrangian point ( l@xmath1 : a sonic point ) where conditions can not be steady and the if then oscillates on a timescale of the order of the dynamical timescale of the secondary near l@xmath1 which could result in qpos as suggested by king ( 1989 ) .",
    "this oscillation time scale is proportional to t@xmath31@xmath26h / c@xmath32 ( scaleheight / sound - speed ) which is equivalent to t@xmath31@xmath26(r@xmath33/gm)@xmath34@xmath26176 p@xmath27 .",
    "given the orbital period derived in this paper ( p@xmath1 ) , the predicted oscillation period of l@xmath1 is similar to p@xmath2 ( assuming the size r of the secondary will be larger on the equatorial plane ) . by late 2003 the if could be withdrawn toward the wd irradiating only the inner lagrangian point ( l@xmath1 ) which yields the qpos .",
    "we detected two periodicities in the light curve of the classical nova v2275 cygni ( 2001 ) .",
    "the first one is 0.31449(15 ) d which we attribute to the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "the modulation depth of the mean light curve folded on this period indicates a change from 0@xmath35.42@xmath80@xmath35.06 to 0.@xmath1822@xmath80.@xmath1812 over the course of one year .",
    "we propose that these variations are due to the illumination of the secondary by the hot wd where the aspect variations of the heated / irradiated secondary reveals the binary period of the system .",
    "the reduction in the modulation depths indicates the changing conditions in the ionization front at the location of the secondary .",
    "this highly ionizing radiation could originate from a hot wd which went through a super soft x - ray phase while burning h on its surface .",
    "we also detect a second period 0.017079(17 ) d in the year 2003 which we interpret as a qpo from our data in 2002 - 2003 . for the origin of this period",
    "we propose either a magnetic cataclysmic variable scenario ( e.g , the interaction of blobs with the magnetosphere ) or a scenario where the qpos are a result of oscillations of the inner lagrangian point ( l@xmath1 ) due to irradiation from a cooling hot wd . both scenarios indicate that some form of accretion is being established in the nova system after the outburst .",
    "our preliminary analysis reveal that both periods exist in 2004 data and the modulation depth of the first period is further reduced .",
    "the photometric observations of v2275 cyg in 2004 ( still conducted at tug ) should reveal the changing shape and depth of the orbital modulations and qpos which will , inturn , portray the evolution of the wd itself .",
