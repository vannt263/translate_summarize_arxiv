    "the discoveries of complex organic ( and even prebiotic ) molecules on small scales of low - mass protostars @xcite as well as the presence of rotationally supported disks relatively early in their evolution @xcite sets an interesting frame for the question : what are the initial conditions for the chemistry in young solar system analogs ?",
    "one of the key challenges is to follow the chemistry with increasing temperature and density as material falls in from molecular clouds to solar - system scales close to the young star .",
    "the chemistry leading to the formation of larger molecules likely involves a complex balance between molecules freezing out on dust grains , grain surface chemistry and eventual evaporation of the species before they may be ( re-)incorporated in ices in the circumstellar disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "however , not only does this depend on the wide - ranging network of chemical reactions  but more fundamentally also on the exact physical history of material as it is accreted . in the simplest picture",
    "the temperature increases monotonically as material falls in closer to the central protostar at a constant rate . in reality , however , variations in , for example , the accretion rate may strongly affect the protostellar luminosity and thus temperature throughout the cloud . since the dust temperature is crucial for the gas - grain chemistry , luminosity variations can have a strong effect on the radial distribution of the chemistry  and from source to source .    with the high angular resolution and surface brightness sensitivity of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , it is becoming possible to image the distribution of molecular species toward individual protostars on solar system scales .",
    "this paper presents alma images of the deeply embedded protostar iras  153983359 ( iras15398 hereafter ) , located in the lupus i molecular cloud ( b228 ) @xcite at a distance of 155  pc @xcite . from a reanalysis of its sed and submillimeter continuum maps , its luminosity @xmath7=1.8  @xmath8 , bolometric temperature , @xmath9=44  k and envelope mass , @xmath10 makes it a fairly standard `` class 0 '' low - mass protostar . from a chemical point of view iras15398",
    "is interesting as it is one of two prototypical sources with prominent carbon - chain molecules such as c@xmath11h , c@xmath11h@xmath5 , ch@xmath3cch and hc@xmath12n @xcite .",
    "this peculiar chemistry has been suggested to be either an indication of the primordial conditions of the clouds and relative time - scales and degrees of freeze - out for co and ch@xmath11 @xcite or a flatter density and temperature profile on larger scales of the envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the main aim of this paper is to relate the observed chemical emission signatures to the physical structure and evolution of the protostar .",
    "iras  153983359 was observed on four occasions between 2012 march 29 and 2012 april 11 as part of the alma early science cycle  0 program 2011.0.00628.s ( pi jes jrgensen ) at 0.87  mm ( alma band 7 ) . at the time of observations 1516",

    "the observations contain four spectral windows with 3840 channels and a channel width of 122  khz ( 0.11  km  s@xmath20 ) .",
    "the spectral setup was chosen to cover 336.95337.45  ghz , 338.30338.80  ghz , 349.35349.85  ghz and 346.90347.40  ghz . a second dataset obtained in connection with this program , targeting the protostar r  cra - irs7b with a similar spectral setup ,",
    "is presented by @xcite .",
    "the reduction followed standard recipes in casa @xcite with calibration of the complex gains through observations of the quasar j1517 - 243 , passband calibration on j1325 - 430 and flux calibration on neptune and titan .",
    "this procedure provides a dataset with a beam size of about 0.55@xmath210.37  ( pa  =  @xmath1982@xmath22 ) , slightly varying with wavelength , and an rms level of 13  mjy  beam@xmath20  channel@xmath20 .",
    "the continuum was constructed by averaging the channels across the four spectral bands that appear reasonably free of line emission with a resulting rms level of about 0.28  mjy  beam@xmath20 .",
    "the ch@xmath3oh @xmath23 transitions at 338.3338.7  ghz were also targeted in a parallel program ( 2011.0.00777.s ; pi nami sakai ) and observed with 24 antennas for 1  hour on - source . for those ch@xmath3oh transitions as well as the continuum we combine the datasets for a slight improvement in signal - to - noise .",
    "the continuum emission from iras15398 is clearly detected at @xmath15=15@xmath1643@xmath170224 ; @xmath18=@xmath1934090671 [ j2000 ] with a peak flux of 19  mjy  beam@xmath20 and integrated flux of 28  mjy ( fig .  [ contimage]a ) . for comparison",
    "the jcmt / scuba image of iras15398 from the scuba legacy archive @xcite shows the core on larger scales with a total integrated flux of 3.9  jy at 850  @xmath24 m .",
    "the bright part of the continuum emission in the alma maps is largely unresolved .",
    "some low level extended emission is seen though , reflecting the resolved - out low surface brightness emission from the ambient envelope seen in the jcmt data .",
    "generally , emission that is smooth on scales much larger than 9@xmath6 ( 1400  au ) or present on scales larger than 16@xmath6 ( 2500  au ) will be unreliable due to the lack of short baselines and size of the alma primary beam at 345  ghz .",

    "the most noteworthy non - detection is sio 87 suggesting that there is no strong shock activity on small scales .",
    "the line - profiles are relatively narrow ( fwhm @xmath31  kms@xmath20 ) and symmetric .",
    "all lines are detected at a systemic velocity of 5.0  km  s@xmath20with the exception of h@xmath1co@xmath2 43 that peaks red - shifted by about 1.0  km  s@xmath20  compared to the other species .",
    "the c@xmath0o , c@xmath4s and ch@xmath3oh emission is found toward the central continuum peak and concentrated within about one arcsecond radius ( fig .",
    "[ lineimage ] ) .",
    "h@xmath1co@xmath2 in contrast is predominantly present beyond this radius in a ring - like structure with a width of about 1 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the extended c@xmath5h emission related to the outflow is deferred to a separate publication ( y.  oya et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the detection of ch@xmath3oh and tentative detections of ch@xmath3cn and ch@xmath3och@xmath3 mark the first discoveries of these complex organic species toward one of the sources characterized by the presence of the carbon - chain molecules .",
    "the velocity offset and peculiar morphology of h@xmath1co@xmath2 is significant .",
    "the h@xmath1co@xmath2 line profile itself is very symmetric and no emission or absorption is seen at the lower lsr velocity of the other species .",
    "together with the extended continuum and c@xmath5h emission being present on - source and the lack of clear negative bowls of emission , this suggests that spatial - filtering or limited dynamical range due to the @xmath32-coverage is not the reason .",
    "instead it suggests that h@xmath1co@xmath2 is present in gas that is kinematically and morphologically different than the other species . with the current sensitivity and resolution",
    "it is not possible to address the kinematic nature of this component further , however .",
    "the most striking aspect of the data is the presence of c@xmath0o and lack of h@xmath1co@xmath2 toward the central position in iras15398 .",
    "an explanation could be that the innermost region represents a lower density environment where c@xmath0o 32 could be excited and not the higher density tracer h@xmath1co@xmath2 43 .",
    "however , with the additional detections of c@xmath4s and ch@xmath3oh on small scales this can be ruled out .",
    "the differences between these species must be the result of their chemistry .    at the densities and temperatures of the bulk protostellar envelope material",
    ", the abundances of co and hco@xmath2 are related through the main formation and destruction mechanisms for hco@xmath2 : @xmath33 indeed , over large ranges of co abundances seen in protostars , these two species are observed to be strongly correlated , likely to first order reflecting the chemistry driven by the freeze - out of co @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation between co and hco@xmath2 in our images suggests that another process is at work as well .",
    "the observed profiles of c@xmath0o and h@xmath1co@xmath2 can be used to quantify their abundances through line radiative transfer modeling . for this purpose",
    ", we adopted a 1d model for the iras15398 envelope with a power - law density profile , constrained by the spectral energy distribution and submillimeter continuum images , and with the temperature distribution calculated self - consistently using the transphere codedullemond / software / transphere / index.shtml ] @xcite .",
    "the iras15398 envelope is well - fit with a power - law density profile decreasing toward larger radii as @xmath34 with @xmath35 and a density of @xmath36  @xmath37 and a temperature of 30  k at 175200  au ( 11.5@xmath6 ) .",
    "subsequently the line radiative transfer was performed for c@xmath0o and h@xmath1co@xmath2 using the one - dimensional ratran code @xcite following the same approach as in , e.g. , @xcite : the abundances of the two species were taken to be constant in regions separated at specific temperatures and adjusted to match the observed brightness profiles ( fig .",
    "[ chemfits ] ) .",
    "it is possible to reproduce the observed emission for c@xmath0o with an abundance of 5@xmath38 ( a co abundance of 1@xmath39 ) in the inner regions of the envelope with temperatures above 30  k ( 175  au ) and 5@xmath40 at larger radii ( i.e. , depletion by a factor 100 ) .",
    "this confirms the expectation that c@xmath0o is present in the inner regions of the envelopes where the temperature increases above the co sublimation temperature  similar to what is seen in other protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for h@xmath1co@xmath2 in contrast it is only possible to reproduce the observed profiles with an abundance of 7@xmath41 ( hco@xmath2 abundance of 5@xmath42 ) in the region of the envelope where the temperature is between 20  k and 30  k and a drop in abundance of at least a factor 20 inside and outside this region .",
    "a possible explanation for the depletion of hco@xmath2 on small scales is that it is destroyed by dipolar , neutral molecules .",
    "the most abundant of these is h@xmath5o , which predominantly is present in solid form in protostellar envelopes .",
    "however , in regions where the temperatures increase above 100  k water sublimates and becomes an important destroyer of hco@xmath2 .",
    "[ watermodel ] shows the result of a steady state calculation based on the more detailed models of @xcite utilizing the udfa12 gas - phase chemical network @xcite . in this simple calculation",
    "we show the hco@xmath2 abundance as function of h@xmath5o and c@xmath5h abundance at a density of @xmath43  @xmath37 , temperature of 30  k and cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath44  s@xmath20 .",
    "an h@xmath5o abundance increase to @xmath45 is enough to reduce hco@xmath2 by two orders of magnitude  matching the inferred abundance profile inferred from the observations . alternatively ,",
    "other neutral species , such as the carbon - chain molecules or h@xmath5co , could also work as destroyers of hco@xmath2 .",
    "however , due to their weaker dipole moments , their abundances need to be comparably larger to destroy hco@xmath2 efficiently ( fig .  [ watermodel ] ) .",
    "for example , in the chemical models by @xcite , h@xmath5co is the main destroyer of hco@xmath2 at intermediate temperatures  but the gas - phase abundances of h@xmath5co in those models are as high as 10@xmath46 , which are not supported by observations of low - mass protostars that show typical abundances of h@xmath5co @xmath4710@xmath48 in the warm gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the main issue about the scenario in which water acts as the main destroyer is that temperatures of 100  k are only reached in the inner 25  au for a 1.8  @xmath8 source such as iras15398  much smaller than the h@xmath1co@xmath2 ring .",
    "high water abundances on large scales could be caused by , e.g. , an outflow - driven shock  and indeed lead to the destruction of hco@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "water is detected toward iras15398 with herschel - pacs and found to be associated with the outflow @xcite , but the ring - like structure of h@xmath1co@xmath2 and relatively narrow lines of ch@xmath3oh ( another molecule that could be produced by ice sputtering ) speak against this being the reason for the observed emission structures here .",
    "another solution is that iras15398 has recently undergone a change in luminosity ",
    "e.g. , related to a burst in accretion .",
    "such accretion bursts have been proposed to be characteristic of the embedded protostellar stages and invoked to explain for example the distribution of observed luminosities of embedded protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an increase in luminosity would sublimate water in a much larger region than hinted by its current luminosity and after the burst water would stay in the gas - phase for a period of time corresponding to the h@xmath5o freeze - out time - scales . to sublimate water at a distance of 175  au of iras15398 , its luminosity ( and accretion rate )",
    "should have been higher by two orders of magnitude than currently . at the density of the iras15398 envelope at this distance of @xmath43  @xmath37 ,",
    "the time - scale for water to freeze - out is of order @xmath49  years , which can be considered an upper limit to the time since the burst .",
    "unfortunately no direct imaging of the water vapor in iras15398 exists  but ch@xmath3oh may work for a good proxy for water as it desorbs at similar temperatures .",
    "[ chemfits ] illustrates that the ch@xmath3oh is indeed present and extended on the scales where h@xmath1co@xmath2 is absent , lending further credibility to this suggestion . a simple estimate using _ radex _",
    "@xcite shows that the c@xmath0o 32 and ch@xmath3oh @xmath50 are similar in strength for a [ ch@xmath3oh]/[co ] abundance ratio of @xmath51 at the density of @xmath52  @xmath37 and temperature of 30  k characteristic of the ch@xmath3oh emitting region . assuming a standard co abundance of @xmath53 this translates into a ch@xmath3oh abundance with respect to h@xmath5 of @xmath54 in this inner region .",
    "the suggestion of a recent episodic accretion burst also raises another interesting perspective  namely it may have triggered the chemistry leading to the formation of warm carbon - chain molecules on large scales in the iras15398 envelope .",
    "observations of the two prototypical sources , l1527 and iras15398 , show that these carbon - chain molecules are present on large scales of a few thousand au but with a sharp abundance increase inward of 1000 au @xcite .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the widespread emission is related to carbon - chain molecules produced in the early phase of prestellar evolution  but the additional increase at 1000  au scales require ch@xmath11 being present in the gas - phase at temperatures of @xmath1330  k ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the model above the envelope temperatures of iras15398",
    "is currently only about 15  k on the 1000  au scales and only reach 30  k in the inner 175  au .",
    "however , if it has undergone a burst in recent history this could have caused ch@xmath11 to evaporate and trigger the carbon - chain chemistry at much larger radii : an increase in luminosity by a factor 50100 would for example shift the radius where the temperature is 30  k out to 15002200  au .",
    "it is interesting to note that l1527 and iras15398 both contain relatively weak compact continuum emission compared to many other deeply embedded protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . with the assumption in that paper , the observed compact continuum emission on baselines @xmath55",
    "k@xmath14 corresponds to 0.029  @xmath56 in l1527 and @xmath57  @xmath56 in iras15398  compared to the median 0.089  @xmath56 for the class 0 protostars .",
    "the nature of this compact continuum emission is still unclear ",
    "but one possibility is that it reflects the build - up of an unstable ( pseudo-)disk @xcite . in that scenario",
    ", the absence of strong compact continuum emission toward these two sources would indicate that they have recently shedded these massive disks .    in summary",
    ", the proposed scenario of a recent accretion burst explains four characteristic signatures observed toward iras15398 : _",
    "( i ) _ the clear absence of hco@xmath2 in the region with prominent co emission , _",
    "( i ) _ the presence of extended ch@xmath3oh emission relative to its current luminosity , _ ( iii ) _ the presence of warm carbon - chain molecules on large scales and _ ( iv ) _ the absence of very massive dust continuum component on small scales .",
    "although , different mechanisms can possibly explain any one of these signatures , the strength of the proposed scenario is that it accounts for all .",
    "if the scenario is confirmed through similar observations of other protostars , statistics of the detections of such signatures could shed further light onto the frequency of similar bursts during the embedded protostellar stages .",
