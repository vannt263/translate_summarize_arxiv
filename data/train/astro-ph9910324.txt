    "the spatial and temporal coincidence between the grb980425 and sn  1998bw ( @xcite , @xcite ) raised the issue of the association of ( some ) grbs with sn explosions .",
    "so far the study of the statistical correlation of sne with batse and batse / ulysses bursts has given contradictory results .",
    "some authors have proposed that all grbs originate from sne  ib / c .",
    "these are core - collapse sne whose progenitors have lost most or all of the hydrogen envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , only a weak correlation was found between the general list of sne and grbs ( @xcite ) . as an alternative",
    "it has been suggested that only a small fraction of the grbs originate from asymmetric explosions of rare , highly energetic sn ib / c ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , bloom et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on the basis of a model for the radio emission of sn  1998bw have derived the characteristics which a sn must have in order to produce a detectable grb ( weak single burst ) .",
    "again they indicate highly energetic ib / c events as best candidate sources of ( some ) grbs .",
    "germany et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed grb 970514 as another compelling association between a highly energetic sn and a grb .",
    "was discovered on july 16 , 1997 ( @xcite ) in the compact and faint galaxy n.342 of the cluster sersic 40/6 = abell 3266 ( z = 0.059 ; @xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively narrow h@xmath13 emission led to the classification of as a type iin .",
    "the epoch of the sn explosion is constrained by a prediscovery limit on march 12 and is consistent , within the uncertainties , with the association with grb 970514 , whose @xmath14 error box was centered only @xmath15 away .    the probability of a chance association of the sn with one of the 119 batse events which occurred in the period between the pre - discovery observation and the discovery images is 0.7% ( @xcite ) .",
    "after , this is the most compelling case for sn / grb association .",
    "grb 970514 was a single - peak burst detected also above 300 kev .",
    "at the distance of , the burst energy would be @xmath16 erg , which makes grb 970514 more energetic than grb 980425 , but orders of magnitude weaker than other bursts with measured redshifts ( @xcite ) .    in this letter we present and discuss optical observations of obtained up to 2.5 years after discovery , together with a model of the light curve derived with a high progenitor mass and explosion energy .",
    "imaging photometry of has been obtained in bvri with several telescopes at eso ",
    "typical seeing was 1.2 arcsec .",
    "a sequence of local reference stars has been measured on seven photometric nights in order to calibrate non - photometric data .",
    "very deep vlt / fors1 imaging ( seeing 0.6 arcsec ) in v and r about 2.5 yr after discovery did not detect the sn .",
    "although there is very good agreement for the stars in common with germany et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we note a difference between our sn magnitudes and their estimates .",
    "this is small ( 0.15mag ) at maximum , but it increases with epoch up to 0.4 mag .",
    "we verified that measuring the sn magnitude with different techniques , psf - fitting or subtraction of pre - discovery images ( kindly provided by b. schmidt , priv .",
    "comm . ) - the method used by germany et al .",
    "- produces similar results even at late epochs .",
    "artificial star experiments show that at all epochs for which we could make the comparison between the data sets our typical errors are smaller than 0.1 mag .",
    "we believe that the inconsistency is partially due to the different passbands ( @xcite ) , although the modest spectral evolution of should not cause a temporal dependence , and/or to incorrect flux calibration of low signal  to  noise data .",
    "in particular there is the possibility of contamination by two nearby ( 2 arcsec ) bright knots ( se and sw ) inside the parent galaxy , which could be severe for imaging at small scales or with bad seeing .",
    "the light curve of does not conform to the classical templates of sn ii , namely plateau and linear , but resembles the slow evolution of the type iin ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath17 for the galactic extinction ( @xcite ) we get for an absolute magnitude at maximum @xmath0 .",
    "this makes the brightest sn ii discovered so far , brighter than the very luminous sn  1979c and 1983k ( m@xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xcite , with @xmath2  mpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "note that schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) give @xmath20 .",
    "as far as we know , no detections at other wavelengths have been reported , except for some not very stringent radio limits at 20 cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ uvoir _ bolometric light curve of obtained using the available bvri photometry and the spectrophotometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ lcbolo ] . integrating the bolometric light curve we estimate that the sn has emitted about @xmath21 ergs from the day of discovery to our last detection ,",
    "not including the grb luminosity .",
    "we stress that the _ uvoir _ determinations are by necessity lower limits of the true bolometric luminosities .",
    "the late time light curve of most sne is powered by the radioactive decay of to .",
    "if the hard @xmath4-rays from the decay are completely thermalised in the ejecta , the mass of , the parent isotope of , can be estimated directly from the luminosity on the tail of the light curve .",
    "typical masses for sne ii are @xmath22 ( e.g. sn  1987a ) , but extreme cases range from 0.002 for  ( @xcite ) to 0.3 for sn  1992am ( @xcite ) .    between 60 and 120 days after the outburst , which is taken to be coincident with the grb , the light curve of matches the decline rate expected if the energy input was the decay of .",
    "the estimated initial mass of  is 2.3 . at 4 months",
    "the sn decline becomes slower , suggesting that another source of energy is present . between days 250 and 550 the light curve again matches the decay of 6 , which is clearly dubious .",
    "then the light curve suddenly drops , as does the emission . on day 655",
    "the sn could not be detected with the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the last points of our bolometric light curve lie above the radioactive tail of 2.3 of , but are compatible with a value close to that proposed by germany et al .",
    "( 1999 ) if we allow for some interaction .",
    "however , our observations indicate that the late drop mentioned above occurs about 100 days later than estimated by germany et al .",
    "other observable signatures of the interaction , besides the slow decline , are complex line profiles evolving with time , easily detectable in the prominent line , and powerful radio and x - ray emission ( @xcite ) . in shows an unresolved emission and at least two broader components , which become narrower with time . at the epoch of the first observation",
    "the broadest component has fwhm @xmath23 , and its flux dominates over the intermediate ( fwhm @xmath24 ) one .",
    "one year after the explosion , the broadest component has almost disappeared and the intermediate component ( now with fwhm @xmath25 ) is the most evident spectral feature in the spectrum . was last detected on april 12 , 1999 , when only a faint h@xmath13 emission was detected at the 3-@xmath26 level ( f@xmath27 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath28 ; fwhm @xmath29 ) .    in figure 2 we show representative spectra of at various epochs , and in figure 3 we compare the spectra of and , since a certain spectral similarity between the two sne is possibly suggestive .",
    "lines of different widths are present in the spectra of . at early epochs",
    "there are very broad bands ( fwhm @xmath30 a ) probably blends of several lines , the strongest of which are measured at 4150 , 4900 , 5800 , 7800 and 9100 a ( caii ir triplet ) .",
    "narrow lines include , , and [ oiii ] 5007 a. intermediate width lines ( fwhm @xmath31 ) include hei 5876 a , which appears in emission between day 100 and 150 ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 ) .",
    "a multiwavelength study of showed that the energy radiated from radio to x - rays was as high as @xmath32 ergs ( aretxaga et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting complete reprocessing of the mechanical energy of the ejecta in only a few years .",
    "the behaviour of the interaction between the sn ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium in sn  1988z has been modelled by terlevich et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in the framework of the compact supernova remnants ( csnr ) scenario , and by chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) , who invoked the presence of a rarefied wind together with a denser component in the form of clumps or an equatorial wind .",
    "the optical light curve , the x  ray emission , the emission and the line width evolution of sn  1988z are generally reproduced by these models but the resulting ejecta and csm masses are model dependent . in what follows both the similarities and differences between sn  1988z and sn  1997cy should be kept in mind .",
    "the two sne are similar in apparently having a 3-component profile of the dominant  emission line , and their light curves , though not equally well sampled , have the same slow decline for the first two years .",
    "sn  1988z was an order - of - magnitude less luminous than sn  1997cy , while the complex of line blending in the 4000 - 6000 a region is clearly different , as shown by careful inspection of fig.3 .",
    "the similarities between and suggest that we investigate an interaction model for as well .",
    "our exploratory model considers the explosion of a massive star of @xmath33 with a parameterized explosion energy @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that the collision starts near the stellar radius at a distance @xmath35 , where the density of the csm is @xmath36 , and adopt for the csm a power - law density profile @xmath37 .",
    "the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath36 , and @xmath38 , are constrained from comparison with the observations .",
    "the numerical code and input physics are the same as developed by suzuki & nomoto ( 1995 ) .    as in the csnr model the regions excited by the forward and reverse shock emit mostly x - rays .",
    "the density in the shocked ejecta is so high that the reverse shock is radiative and a dense cooling shell is formed ( e.g. suzuki & nomoto 1995 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - rays are absorbed by the outer layers and core of the ejecta , and re - emitted as uv - optical photons .",
    "narrow lines are emitted from the slowly expanding unshocked csm photoionized by the sn uv outburst or by the radiation from the shocks ; intermediate width lines come from the shock - heated csm ; broad lines come from either the cooler region at the interface between ejecta and csm , or the unshocked ejecta heated by inward propagating x - rays .",
    "figure  [ lcmod ] shows the model light curve which best fits the observations .",
    "the model parameters are : @xmath39 erg , @xmath40 g @xmath41 at @xmath42 cm ( which corresponds to a mass - loss rate of @xmath43  yr@xmath3 for a wind velocity of 10 ) , and @xmath44 .",
    "the large mass - loss episode giving rise to the dense csm is supposed to occur after the progenitor makes a loop in the hr diagram from bsg to rsg . in this model ,",
    "the mass of the low - velocity csm is @xmath45 , which implies that the transition from bsg to rsg took place about @xmath7 yr before the sn event .",
    "the large csm mass and density and the very large explosion energy are necessary to have large shocked masses and thus to reproduce the observed high luminosity . in models with low @xmath34 and high @xmath36",
    "the reverse shock speed is too low to produce a sufficiently high luminosity .",
    "for example , a model with @xmath46 erg and @xmath36 as above yields a value of @xmath47 lower than the observed one by a factor of @xmath48 5 . for high @xmath34 or low @xmath36 ,",
    "the sn ejecta expand too fast for the cooling shell to absorb enough x - rays to sustain the luminosity .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 and @xmath49 are constrained within a factor of @xmath48 3 of the reported values .",
    "the shape of the light curve constrains the circumstellar density structure .",
    "if @xmath50 , the case of a steady wind , is used , @xmath47 decreases too rapidly around day 200 .",
    "the observed light curve shows a first , slight drop after day @xmath48 300 .",
    "this can be reproduced if the csm density is assumed to drop abruptly at the radius reached by the forward shock at day 300 , so that the collision becomes weaker afterwards .",
    "this change of the csm density marks the transition of the progenitor from bsg to rsg , which should have occurred @xmath51 yr before the sn explosion .",
    "this is consistent with the simultaneous decrease of the h@xmath13 luminosity mentioned in sect.4 .",
    "after this date , the light curve is powered only by the reverse shock propagating into the ejecta . after day @xmath48 550",
    "the observed light curve shows a second , sharper drop , which is reproduced ( figure  [ lcmod ] ) assuming that after the reverse shock has propagated through @xmath48 5 @xmath52 of ejecta it encounters a region of very low density and thus it dies . in other words",
    ", the model assumes that most of the progenitor s core material fell into a massive ( @xmath53 ) black hole , while only the extended h / he envelope of @xmath48 5 @xmath52 was ejected .",
    "therefore , both forward and reverse shocks propagated inside h / he dominated ejecta .",
    "however , the fact that the ejecta - csm model with high explosion energy reproduce the light curve does not necessarily mean that the radioactive energy input is small , because of the uncertainty in the model fitting . to constrain the contribution from the radioactive decay",
    ", we calculated the optical light curve of the sn caused by the combination of shock heating and radioactive decay .",
    "we find that a contribution of up to 0.7  of @xmath54ni is allowed .",
    "however , the decline rate of the radioactive component after day 60 is much faster than the half - life of the decay , because the explosion is so energetic that only a fraction of @xmath4-rays is trapped in the ejecta .",
    "this implies that radioactive decay can not explain the slope of the observed light curve even between 60 and 120 days .",
    "the spectra of obtained within about 100 days from the grb show broad emission lines which disappear at later times leaving only a blue continuum .",
    "broad emission lines originate in the fast expanding ejecta which , in the interaction model , absorb x - rays produced in the shocks .",
    "this is in principle not very different from the mechanism active in the case of radioactive powering , i.e. the deposition of hard radiation ( @xmath4-rays in that case ) .",
    "the width of the broad lines , 13,000 , is consistent with the outer velocity of the expanding ejecta in the interaction model ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "broad ca  ii emission lines are easily identified . however , the fe  ii ] and fe  iii ] emission lines strong in the nebular spectra of type ia sne ( sne ia ) are not obviously identified .",
    "this could mean that either the ejected ( i.e. ) mass is small or that the densities are so high that forbidden lines are collisionally quenched .",
    "in fact the broad feature near 4500 a might be attributed to the feii multiplets 37 and 38 , while the very broad feature near 5000a may be dominated by a blend of the feii multiplets 42 , 48 , and 49 .",
    "high densities in the ejecta of appear on the other hand an almost inevitable conclusion : with a characteristic velocity not much higher than that of sne  ia nebulae , the interaction model for predicts an ejecta mass of @xmath45 , i.e. a factor of @xmath56 larger .",
    "the epoch of the spectra is also much earlier than it is for sne  ia in their nebular epoch ( 100 v. 300 days ) , thus adding another factor of @xmath57 to the density .",
    "thus we can expect the typical density in the ejecta to be @xmath58 times that of sne  ia at 300 days .",
    "this implies densities of about @xmath59 @xmath41 .",
    "electron densities of course depend also on the degree of ionization , but values of at least @xmath60 @xmath41 can be expected .",
    "if the forbidden lines are quenched , emission could occur in permitted fe  ii lines which may be present in the spectrum of , as suggested above .",
    "nevertheless , the excitation of feii lines in sne and agn s involves processes not yet fully understood .",
    "the h@xmath13 profile of was explained within the ejecta ",
    "csm interaction scenario by chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) , who derived a mass for the ejecta smaller than 1 , with a progenitor main sequence mass of 8 to 10 . modelling the light curve of as the result of interaction",
    "may therefore be worthwhile , and it might indicate a larger mass for .",
    "however , another property  and  have in common is that neither [ oi ] 6300 nor mgi ] 4571 have been detected at any stage in their spectra .",
    "the critical densities of these lines are expected to be a few times 10@xmath61 and a few times 10@xmath62 , respectively . the envelope density at late phases",
    "would not be expected to exceed these values .",
    "since only stars with masses less than 8 - 10  ( nomoto 1984 ) are expected to synthesize little oxygen , one is left with the conundrum of the missing oxygen and magnesium if it is assumed that these sne originated from significantly higher mass stars .",
    "the model described in the previous section might resolve this conundrum : o and mg synthesised in the core have fallen into the black hole ; the ejecta are basically the h / he layers and thus contain the original ( solar abundance ) heavy elements plus some heavy elements mixed from the core before fall back .",
    "if the sn formed a black hole , the progenitor mass was probably larger than @xmath63 ( e.g. ergma & van den heuvel 1998 ) .",
    "the large energy implied from the modelling of and indeed its high luminosity alone might suggest a causal connection between energetic sn events ( hypernovae ) and the occurrence of grb s .",
    "it appears that hypernovae occur in a variety of sn types .",
    "objects such as sne 1998bw and 1997ef ( iwamoto et al .",
    "2000 ) are of type ic , while is of type iin . the recent sn  1999e ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ) , whose spectrum is identical to that of , may be another type iin hypernova .",
