    "the cosmic ray flux at any given position in the galaxy is due to many sources , which are probably related to the remnants of supernovae .",
    "each source of position @xmath1 and age @xmath2 yields , at position @xmath3 and time @xmath4 ( now ) , a flux @xmath5 that can be obtained by solving the diffusion equation with the appropriate source term and boundary conditions ( see below ) .",
    "the total flux is given by @xmath6 this model has been coined myriad model by @xcite .    the effects of discreteness have been studied in the past .",
    "as regards the spatial discreteness , @xcite start with the time dependent diffusion equation when both spallations and energy losses are taken into account , to eventually derive the steady - state green function necessary to study the no - near source effect ( expected to reproduce a depletion of the path length distribution at low grammage ) .",
    "as for the temporal discreteness , @xcite derived time dependent solutions in the framework of halo models ( see also @xcite ) , including spallations but assuming a gas density which is constant throughout the diffusive volume ( in this case the mean time and the mean matter crossed are proportional ) . the most complete work to provide  simple \" formula to the time - dependent case",
    "is probably @xcite , who derive the mean age and the grammage distribution to seek if it is possible to constrain the propagation parameters from current observations of charged nuclei .",
    "they conclude that a large degeneracy in propagation parameters remains in most cases .",
    "it has been shown that the distribution of electrons and positrons at high energy is particularly sensitive to nearby sources , due to their huge energy losses ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "a nearby source such as the supernova remnant ( snr ) associated with the geminga pulsars probably has a great influence on them .",
    "the situation is less clear about the stable charged cosmic ray spectra , but nearby sources are expected to be more and more important as energy grows . whereas some authors estimate the contribution from geminga to be at most 10% @xcite , some others @xcite argue that a single supernova event can explain the feature observed in the spectrum at a few pev",
    ". this could be the sco - cen association that is expected to be able to generate the local bubble 11 myr ago @xcite .",
    "this can be tested by measuring the anisotropy ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or by gathering observations from the past and from the rest of the galaxy . for instance , @xcite argued that geminga could be responsible for an increase of the cosmic ray flux by a factor 1.8 by inspection of antarctic ice sediments .",
    "the measurement of the isotopic composition of the earth crust ( see e.g. @xcite ) , of meteorites , and of ice cores may be used to investigate the time variation of the cosmic ray flux on earth ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "most studies of the chemical composition of cosmic rays assume that the sum ( [ somme_stat ] ) may be approximated by an integral @xmath7 which is equivalent to ( [ somme_stat ] ) only in the limit of a source distribution which is continuous in space and time ( continuous distributions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "this approximation is justified if the sources are numerous and densely distributed , but it probably fails for nearby and/or recent sources , for which the detailed location and age should be known .",
    "this paper is devoted to investigate the validity of this approximation and to provide a more accurate description of diffusion when it fails .",
    "the chemical composition of cosmic rays is determined by the quantity of matter that has been crossed by primaries during their propagation from the sources to the earth , and it can be conveniently described and studied by the grammage distribution .",
    "is devoted to the study of the grammage distribution in diffusion models , and the importance of space discreteness of the sources on the cosmic ray composition is investigated .",
    "sec .  3 presents a new analytical solution of the time - dependent diffusion equation for point sources , taking into account spallations , convective wind and escape .",
    "it is then used to find a criterion to separate the sources in two categories , one containing the faraway and old , which can be modelled by the usual steady - state model , the other containing the close or recent , which require a finer description .",
    "sec .  4 concludes and presents some applications of the present work which will be further developped in a next paper .",
    "during their journey between a source and earth , cosmic rays cross regions in which interstellar matter is present .",
    "the nuclear reactions ( spallations ) induced by the collisions lead to a change in the chemical composition .",
    "cosmic rays can be sorted according to the _ grammage _ , i.e. the column density of matter they have crossed ( denoted by @xmath8 in this paper and usually expressed in g @xmath9 ) .",
    "if it is temporarily assumed that cosmic rays do not interact with the matter they cross , i.e. the spallations are switched off , their density originating from a source located at @xmath10 , detected at @xmath11 , and having crossed the grammage @xmath8 is called the _ path - length distribution_. it can be used to compute the probability of nuclear reaction when the spallations are switched on , and thus it provides a tool to compare several diffusion models , as similar path - length distributions give rise to similar chemical compositions .",
    "the evolution of the _ path - length distribution _ @xmath12 at position @xmath13 and time @xmath14 can be described by a generalized diffusion equation inspired by @xcite : @xmath15 where in the right - hand side , the first term stands for diffusion , the second is the source term ( creating particles with null grammage ) and the third gives the augmentation of the grammage due to the crossing of matter .",
    "it should be noted that when the density @xmath16 is not homogeneous in the whole diffusive volume , grammage is not proportional to time ( this will be discussed further in sec .  [ subsec : higdon ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq_fond ] ) does not take into account the influence of the spallations on propagation , but rather introduces the variable @xmath8 as a counter which keep tracks of the quantity of matter crossed by the cosmic rays , spallations being switched off .",
    "the density can finally be obtained from the grammage distribution by noting that a primary cosmic ray having crossed a grammage @xmath8 has a survival probability given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the destruction cross - section . in the following",
    ", @xmath19 will denote the _",
    "mean _ mass of the interstellar medium atoms .",
    "the probability for a cosmic ray emitted in @xmath10 and reaching @xmath3 unharmed is written as @xmath20 for a secondary species , a similar expression can be written @xmath21 where the function @xmath22 is obtained by solving the set of equations @xmath23 with the initial conditions ( the values of @xmath22 for @xmath24 ) set to the source abundance of the considered species .",
    "the path - length distribution , along with the b / c ratio , are computed in the next paragraph .",
    "we take the opportunity of this computation to consider a more general situation than in our previous works , namely by considering a realistic radial dependence of the matter density in the disk .",
    "the aim is twofolds : first , we want to comment on the computation of path lengths by @xcite , and in particular we want to discuss the existence of a feature at @xmath25 g/@xmath26 which they claim is present because of the h@xmath27 ring in the galactic disk .",
    "second , this provides a way to effectively take into account the radial dependence by computing the mean matter density which is probed by each cosmic ray species , and to introduce this mean density back in our code .",
    "we compute the grammage distribution in the diffusion model we used in previous studies @xcite .",
    "it exhibits cylindrical symmetry , escape happens through the @xmath28 and @xmath29 kpc boundaries , galactic wind is constant in the halo and matter is localised in a thin disk at @xmath30 .",
    "we consider a radial dependence of the surface mass density @xmath31 taking into account the radial distributions of hi , hii and h@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "for convenience , we normalize this quantity by the local mean surface density @xmath32 @xmath9 , i.e. we introduce @xmath33 .",
    "the models used in our previous studies considered only flat matter distribution , to keep the problem tractable in a semi - analytical way , and we take the opportunity of this study to investigate the importance of this assumption .    the generalized diffusion equation  ( [ eq_fond ] ) , with the left - hand side set to 0 , can then be solved as detailed in appendix  b , by expanding the quantities over a set of bessel functions .",
    "the solution is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the heaviside distribution , the @xmath36 and the @xmath37 are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath38 for a flat distribution of matter ( @xmath39 independant of @xmath40 ) , this expression reduces to @xmath41 we have not considered energy losses in this computation , as the aim is not to provide a very sophisticated modelling of the cosmic rays diffusion , but rather to give an estimate of various effects .",
    "it follows that the results presented here do not apply directly to electrons and positrons , for which the energy losses are predominant .",
    "we now use the above expression to evaluate the effect of the choice of @xmath31 on the path - length distribution , and then on the composition of cosmic rays .",
    "this is done by first computing the pld for a flat and for a more realistic matter distribution .",
    "the result for @xmath42 kpc@xmath43/myr and @xmath44 kpc is displayed in figure  ( [ influence_h2 ] ) .",
    "the feature at @xmath25 g @xmath9 , visible in the higdon points ( crosses ) is never reproduced by the analytical result .",
    "this difference is discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "the effect on the composition of cosmic rays is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ influence_k ] , where the b / c ratio is computed in the two cases from the pld . for low values of the diffusion coefficient @xmath45 , this ratio is not very sensitive to the global distribution of matter , as the diffusion range is smaller , wheras for higher values of @xmath45 , the b / c ratio is sensitive to the increase of matter density at @xmath46 kpc .",
    "as the diffusion coefficient @xmath47 actually increases with energy , the spectrum is likely to be affected by this effect , cosmic rays of higher energy probing a larger portion of the galactic disk .",
    "however , for high values of @xmath48 , the difference between a flat and a realistic distribution becomes independent of @xmath48 , hence of @xmath49 , so that the shape of the spectrum is not affected .",
    "in particular , if @xmath45 is high , as hinted at by @xcite , then the spectrum is not affected by the presence of a h@xmath27 ring .",
    "these results provide an effective way to take into account the radial distribution of matter in our model . for a given energy",
    ", we can compute the constant interstellar gas density @xmath50 that must be assumed to reproduce the observed @xmath51 ratio .",
    "the same thing can be done for sub - fe / fe , providing another effective density @xmath52 .",
    "these densities are different because the corresponding species have different diffusion ranges , the latter being much more sensitive to spallations .",
    "the flux of each species can then be computed using the appropriate effective interstellar matter density .",
    "another approach has recently been proposed in @xcite to compute the grammage distribution : starting from the cr distribution @xmath53 due to an instantaneous point source of age @xmath14 , the mean matter density seen at age @xmath14 by these cr is computed as @xmath54 summing all the individual contribution with the appropriate weight , the mean matter density @xmath55 seen by the cr of age @xmath14 reaching the earth is computed . from this quantity ,",
    "the evolution of the mean grammage is computed as a function of time , through @xmath56 which corresponds to their eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) .",
    "we argue that this approach is not correct , for the following reasons .",
    "first , the derivation of the time evolution of @xmath57 is given in appendix  b , and the equation ( [ eq4.2 ] ) is not recovered .",
    "the above expression would be correct only with another ( tricky ) definition of @xmath55 and @xmath58 .",
    "second , the averaging process ( [ average_higdon ] ) gives the mean density as seen by _ all _ the crs emitted by the source , whereas what is needed would be the mean density seen by the crs that reach the earth ( those we do observe ) .",
    "these quantities are different , and the corresponding time evolution is computed in appendix  b.    finally , and most importantly , it is quite tricky to infer the grammage distribution @xmath59 ( needed to apply the weighted slab technique ) from the mean grammage @xmath57 , and their relation ( 4.3 ) is not correct . to see that more clearly , consider the more fundamental quantity @xmath60 giving , at position @xmath13 , the density of crs having crossed a grammage @xmath8 at age @xmath14 .",
    "the quantities introduced by @xcite are then related to @xmath60 through @xmath61 which are fundamentally different from their ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.3 ) . in particular",
    ", their @xmath62 is actually @xmath57 and should be a function of @xmath14 in their ( 4.1 ) and ( 4.2 ) , whereas the @xmath63 that appears in their grammage distribution ( 4.3 ) should be a parameter and as such is _ independent _ on @xmath14 .",
    "this explains why we do not find the same grammage distributions as @xcite .",
    "their assimilation of the grammage distribution from individual sources to dirac distributions has the effect of sharpening the final grammage distribution . in particular , the feature at @xmath25 g/@xmath26 is not present in our results .",
    "the distributions appear to be actually quite close to exponentials . ,",
    "i.e. to leaky box distributions .",
    "we now want to investigate the effect of discreteness of the source distribution on the cosmic ray composition , through the path - length distribution .",
    "we first compute this quantity for a point source , and we then compare the path - length distributions obtained for a set of point sources and an equivalent continuous source distribution . for the sake of simplicity , we focus on the case of a uniform distribution of matter , for which @xmath64 is diagonal and the solution given in app .",
    "b can be simplified . as the composition of cosmic rays",
    "is only measured in the galactic disk , we express the results in @xmath30 .",
    "it is then found that @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this expression could have been obtained by an inverse laplace transform of fourier - bessel coefficients of the steady - state density ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath68    the @xmath69 are obtained by fourier - bessel transforming the radial source distribution , which is assumed to be point - like and located in the galactic disk . unless this point source is at the galactic center , the cylindrical symmetry of the problem is broken and the previous study does not apply . however , as the influence of the @xmath70 boundary is expected to be negligible , we consider that the diffusion volume is not limited in the radial direction ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the origin can then be set at the position of the source , which restores cylindrical symmetry . in this @xmath71 limit ,",
    "the summations over bessel functions become integrals , the discrete sets @xmath69 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 become functions @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the final result is obtained by performing the substitution @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the particular case of infinite @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the expression ( [ grammage_source_ponctuelle ] ) gives @xmath85 which is the expression obtained in taillet & maurin ( 2003 ) from a random walk approach .",
    "the path - length distributions ( [ grammage_source_ponctuelle ] ) are displayed in figs .",
    "[ grammages_point_source1 ] and [ grammages_point_source2 ] , for several propagation conditions , to emphasize the relative effect of escape , galactic wind and spallation .",
    "the effect of escape or wind is more important at higher grammages .",
    "this was expected as they correspond to longer paths .",
    "the effect of the convective wind is seen to be similar to that of escape , but quantitatively different at low grammages . to understand this ,",
    "let us first consider diffusion in free space without wind .",
    "several kinds of paths are responsible for low grammages : short paths , connecting us to nearby sources in the disk , and longer paths that wander in the halo without crossing the disk too much .",
    "it happens that the second kind is rather important , which explains why escape from a boundary at @xmath28 ( which kills the paths wandering too far in the halo ) actually affects the low end of the grammage distribution . when wind is present , the short paths are more important , and the low grammages are less affected .    even for a point source ,",
    "the path - lengths are quite broadly distributed around the mean value , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ grammages_point_source1 ] and [ grammages_point_source2 ] . as a result",
    ", the grammage distribution due to a set of discrete sources is smoothed to a great extent , and that it is very unlikely to have observable consequences on the composition of cosmic rays on earth , except for very nearby sources ( see below ) . to illustrate this point",
    ", we compare the grammage distributions and the b / c ratio from a smooth distribution to that obtained from a discrete sample representative of this distribution . the relative importance of the sources located at different distances in making the observed composition ( e.g.",
    "the b / c ratio ) was estimated and discussed in @xcite , and it was found that the nearby sources can be responsible for a substantial fraction of the flux of each species .",
    "the contribution of a point source located at a distance @xmath40 to the b and c flux , obtained from ( [ grammage_source_ponctuelle ] ) , is displayed as a function of @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ grammage_source_ponctuelle ] .",
    "more specifically , we divide the sources into the far ( @xmath86 ) , the intermediate ( @xmath87 ) and the nearby ( @xmath88 ) , and table  [ table_fraction ] gives the fraction of flux coming from these regions , for different species .",

    "table  [ table_fraction ] gives @xmath92 , the surface number density of sources in the disk ( in kpc@xmath93 ) beyond which the difference in composition between the discrete and continuous case is less than 1 % .",
    "the secondaries are less sensitive to the discreteness of sources , as their sources ( the primaries ) do have a continuous distribution .",
    "these results do not depend on the value of @xmath48 , as it is only sensitive to the relative importance of nearby and remote sources .",
    "the results are presented as a function of @xmath94 . if we now consider the disk defined by @xmath95 kpc , the resulting effect of granularity is quite insensitive to the value of @xmath83 ( or @xmath96 ) , as long as @xmath97 kpc ( or @xmath98 kpc ) .",
    "this is because for @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) , the cut - off effect of escape ( or wind ) is always small .",
    "as expected , the effect of discreteness is smaller for the outer rings .",
    "the main effect is that when discrete sources are considered , the very nearby sources necessary to flatten the low end of the distribution are always lacking .",
    "another way of phrasing this result is that shot noise is dominated by the nearby sources .",
    "the absence of nearby sources had been proposed by @xcite to explain , in a different context , the depletion at low grammages that was thought to be observed , before @xcite proposed a settlement to this particular issue .",
    "the total path - length distribution is very close to an exponential , as expected for a homogeneous source distribution in an infinite disk @xcite .",
    "the effect of the wind is very similar to that of escape .",
    "it has been remarked by @xcite that to a given value of @xmath96 ( in the case where the wind velocity is constant in each side of the halo ) can be associated an effective escape height @xmath101 , and we have explicitly checked that the previous results apply by replacing @xmath83 by @xmath102 .",
    "the previous results , as well as the results presented in our previous works , rely on the assumption of a constant wind presenting a discontinuity through the galactic disk .",
    "to probe the sensitivity of our results to this hypothesis , we consider another model in which the value of @xmath103 varies linearly with @xmath104 .",
    "this corresponds to the choice made e.g. in the widely used code galprop .",
    "the calculations are detailed in appendix  c , and the results will be used here without further justification .",
    "the path - length distribution reads @xmath105 with @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the confluent hypergeometric function , also denoted @xmath108 or @xmath109 in the literature . the resulting path - length distribution is shown in fig .  [ grammages_vent_lin1 ] for a linear and a constant ( and discontinuous at @xmath30 ) wind .",
    "it appears that these two situations lead to very similar results , and one can establish a one - to - one correspondence between the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath110 of these models ( see fig .  [ grammages_vent_lin2 ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that the energy losses have not been considered here .",
    "adiabatic losses are associated to the wind gradient , and their effect should be different for the two forms of the galactic wind : in the constant case , they are confined to the disk whereas in the linear case , they are present in the whole diffusive volume .",
    "we now turn to the problem of discreteness in time . for that , we must solve the time - dependent diffusion problem for an instantaneous source .",

    "the result for a source that would accelerate particles for a long period of time would be obtained by integrating the above expression over the acceleration period .",

    "the importance of these effects depends on the position of the source in the @xmath122 plane .",
