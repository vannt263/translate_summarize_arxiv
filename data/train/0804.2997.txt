    "starting from czachor s paper @xcite , einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlations and other quantum information primitives in the relativistic context have been widely discussed @xcite . for massive particles",
    "mostly the spin degrees of freedom are considered .",
    "however , the definition of the spin operator for the relativistic particle is not unique and different operators have been used by different authors @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the helicity of the massive particle can be defined unambiguously and recent papers @xcite shows that helicity entanglement of fermion pair behaves in a different way than spin entanglement .",
    "moreover , the carrier space of the irreducible , unitary representation of the poincar group for photons is spanned by helicity eingenstates .",

    "the spin correlation function can have an extremum .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to consider helicity correlation function for the boson pair and the massless limit of this function . in this paper",
    "we calculate ordinary helicity correlation function of the boson pair in certain scalar states . however , for photons usually the polarization correlations are considered .",
    "therefore , for massive vector bosons we also define polarization states and calculate polarization correlation function .",
    "in particular we identify the two - particle scalar state which posseses a proper massless limit , calculate polarization correlation function in this state , and show that the massless limit of this function is the same as the correlation function in the scalar two - photon state .",
    "we discuss also the violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality by the polarization correlation function .",
    "we show that the degree of violation of the chsh inequality in the center of mass frame depends on the particle momenta .",
