    "the most fundamental model ( known as the quantum rabi model @xcite ) describing light - matter interactions exists in the mutual coupling between a two - level system ( or a qubit ) and a harmonic oscillator .",
    "such a model is of great use in fields ranging from quantum optics and quantum information @xcite to condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "typically , experimental implementations of the kind of such a model have been successful in many physical systems , such as qed cavities @xcite , ion traps @xcite , nanomechanical resonators @xcite , solid systems @xcite , etc .    in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    "systems @xcite , the coupling between a two - level atom and the cavity field is relatively weak as compared to the atom s or field s frequency , thus the rotating - wave approximation functions well and the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model is valid @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental demonstrations associated with the qubit - oscillator system within ultrastrong coupling regime have been reported @xcite , for which the qubit - oscillator coupling rate reaches a significant fraction of the qubit s or oscillator s frequency and the jc model is no longer applicable , generating a plenty of fascinating quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "a natural generalization of the rabi model is to involve @xmath0 qubits simultaneously interacting with a common harmonic oscillator , i.e. , the dicke model @xcite , in which enormous interest has been devoted to investigating the dynamical behavior in the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 , such as superradiance phase transitions and entanglement properties @xcite .",
    "although many mathematics approaches , such as adiabatic approximation @xcite and transformation method @xcite , are presented to analytically treat the rabi model and two - qubit dicke model within the ultrastrong coupling regime @xcite , few existing theoretical approaches can be directly applied to treat the dicke model involving a small number of qubits due to its non - integrability in the hilbert space @xcite , which is believed to possess richer dynamics properties and more potential applications in quantum information processing than that in the rabi model @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the dicke model with three or a little bit more qubits has not been extensively investigated .",
    "recently , tsomokos _ et al .",
    "_ analyzed a similar model and derived a low - energy hamiltonian for the three qubits by adiabatically eliminating the resonator @xcite .",
    "however , their approach does not apply in the ultrastrong - coupling regime , where the state of the resonator is strongly dependent on the state of the qubits .",
    "braak @xcite has analytically obtained the spectrum of the dicke model with three qubits based on the formal but complicated solutions in the bargmann space .",
    "we also achieved the approximately analytical ground state in the dicke model with three qubits by using the transformation method @xcite .",
    "both of the studies @xcite mainly discuss the near - resonant mechanism where the oscillator s frequency is close to the qubit s frequency .",
    "differing in such previous studies @xcite , we explore here two further regimes for the system of three qubits ultrastrongly coupled to an oscillator , i.e. , the oscillator s frequency is far larger than each qubit s frequency ( say , a high - frequency oscillator ) and each qubit s frequency is far larger than the oscillator s frequency ( say , three high - frequency qubits ) .",
    "we use the approach of adiabatic approximation in which the bias of each qubit is distinctly involved , and focus on analyzing their energy - level spectra and ground - state properties with the choice of various system parameters . for the energy - level spectrum ,",
    "we concentrate on studying the degeneracy in low energy levels . for the ground state",
    ", we obtain its nonclassical properties that are necessary for preparing the nonclassical states , including the squeezed state of the oscillator , the schrdinger - cat state of the oscillator , the qubit - oscillator entangled state , and the qubit - qubit entangled state .",
    "different from the rabi model @xcite , the qubit - oscillator coupling strength needed here for generating nonclassical states of the schrdinger - cat type in the oscillator is much smaller .",
    "particularly , we find that the qubit - qubit entanglement in the ground state vanishes if the qubit - oscillator coupling strength is strong enough , in which the entropy of three qubits keeps larger than one .",
    "interestingly , we observe the phase - transition - like behaviors in the regime where each qubit s frequency is far larger than the oscillator s frequency @xcite , which is very different from the phase transition found in the resonant regime @xcite .",
    "possible experiment realization of our generalized dicke model with three high - frequency qubits or a high - frequency oscillator can be expected in the superconducting experiment @xcite , where the flexibility of controlling kinds of system parameters allows one to unearth rich dynamics properties of the system within the ultrastrong coupling regime .",
    "th ( @xmath2 ) qubit with one ground ( @xmath3 ) and one excited states ( @xmath4 ) is coupled to the oscillator with frequency @xmath5 , where the qubit - oscillator coupling strength is denoted by @xmath6 or @xmath7 . ]",
    "the quantum system we consider here is that three identical qubits couple to a common harmonic oscillator , as shown in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of this qubit - oscillator system is written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the pauli matrices ( with @xmath12 = @xmath13 , @xmath14 = @xmath15 , @xmath16 = @xmath17 , and @xmath18 = @xmath13 ) of the @xmath19th qubit , where @xmath13 and @xmath17 are respectively the excited and ground states of the @xmath19th qubit , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the position and momentum operators of the harmonic oscillator . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the gap and bias characterizing each qubit .",
    "@xmath24 is the effective mass of the oscillator with frequency @xmath25 , and @xmath6 is the coupling strength between each qubit and the oscillator . the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath6 are assumed to be positive and real for convenience in the paper .",
    "we can also use the creation ( @xmath26 ) and annihilation ( @xmath27 ) operators to express the oscillator s hamiltonian for convenience : @xmath28 where the zero - point energy @xmath29 in @xmath30 is omitted , and @xmath31    in the basis @xmath32 of the @xmath19th qubit , the eigenenergies of @xmath33 are @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the eigenenergy splitting of the bare qubit , and the energetic excited and ground states are respectively represented by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the angle @xmath38 is introduced here and defined as @xmath39 , which denotes the relative size between @xmath10 and @xmath11 and will be used later .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath30 are supposed to be the @xmath40-photon fock state @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) with the corresponding eigenenergy @xmath43 in the bare oscillator .    since three qubits are equivalent , the system hamiltonian @xmath44 is rotationally invariant which leads to a splitting of the eight - dimensional hilbert space of the qubits into three irreducible components and ensuing degeneracies , on the basis of the formula @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the three - qubit dicke model is mathematically equivalent to two single - qubit rabi models and a spin-@xmath46 system .",
    "however , this symmetry characteristic does not result in integrability because a spin-@xmath46 system has a four - dimensional state space and the nontrivial eigenstates can not be labelled by a quantum number @xcite .",
    "we remark that since the merit of our adiabatic - approximation method is to give the intuitive insight into the physics , the collective operators and nontrivial vectors for the qubit states are not used and the symmetry characteristic is included in the degeneracy analysis of eigenstates and eigenenergies after using adiabatic approximation in two following situations .",
    "in the following section , we focus on exploring the qubit - oscillator system in two extreme regimes that can be analytically treated through the approach of adiabatic approximation .",
    "the first extreme situation we study is that the oscillator s frequency is far larger than the qubit s eigenenergy splitting ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) as well as the coupling strength ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , in which the oscillator approximately keeps in its energy eigenstate and adiabatically follows the changes induced by three qubits states .    based on the idea of adiabatic approximation @xcite , we assume that the @xmath19th qubit has a well defined value of @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . for simplicity , we define four collective - state symbols for three qubits : @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) represents that three qubits are all in their excited states @xmath54 ( ground states @xmath55 ) ; @xmath56 represents that one of three qubits is in its ground state and the other two qubits are both in the excited states , i.e. , @xmath57 or @xmath58 or @xmath59 ; @xmath60 represents that one of three qubits is in its excited state and the other two qubits are both in the ground states , i.e. , @xmath61 or @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , when the qubits are in the state @xmath64 , the effective hamiltonian for the oscillator is : @xmath65 which is the same as that in the system with one qubit and one oscillator @xcite .    when the qubits are in the state @xmath66 , the effective hamiltonian for the oscillator is : @xmath67 which is interpreted as the original oscillator hamiltonian with the term of a larger force applied , as compared to that applied in the system of one or two qubits interacting with an oscillator @xcite .",

    "the second extreme situation we study is that the eigenenergy splitting @xmath114 of each qubit is far larger than @xmath115 and @xmath7 , in which three qubits approximately remain in their energy eigenstates and adiabatically follow the changes induced by the slow oscillator .",
    "similar to the adiabatic approximation discussed in sec .",

    "one way is that the location of the minimum potential deviates from the origin point with a quantity proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "the other way is that the oscillator s frequency is renormalized depending on different states of three qubits : the oscillator s effective frequency increases when the number of qubits in the excited state is more than that in the ground state , while the oscillator s effective frequency is reduced when the number of qubits in the excited state is less than that in the ground state .",
    "note that the variation in the renormalized oscillator s frequency caused by the state of three qubits is proportional to the difference between the number of qubits in the excited state and that in the ground state , which is impossible in the system of one oscillator with only one qubit @xcite .",
