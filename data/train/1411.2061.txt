    "kramers - kronig@xcite analysis , of  for the most part  reflectance data , is often used to estimate the optical conductivity , dielectric function , sum rules , and other optical functions for new materials .",
    "many reports of kramers - kronig analysis of reflectance have appeared , spanning more than 50 years,@xcite with studies of metals,@xcite pure and doped elemental solids,@xcite organic conductors,@xcite charge - density - wave materials,@xcite conducting polymers,@xcite cuprate superconductors,@xcite manganites,@xcite pnictides,@xcite heavy - fermions,@xcite multiferroics,@xcite topological insulators,@xcite and many others . in addition , a number of methods papers have appeared.@xcite    the experimenter typically has data from far infrared through near ultraviolet , covering , say , 5 mev5 ev ( 40 to 40,000 @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is a reasonably wide bandwidth , but the kramers - kronig integral extends from zero to infinity , so that extrapolations need to be made outside the measured range .",
    "the high frequency extrapolation is especially problematic and can cause significant distortions to the conductivity over the entire measured range , with consequences for sum rules as well .",
    "the approach used by most is to extend the reflectance with a power law , @xmath3 , transitioning to @xmath4 at a considerably higher frequency and continuing this free - carrier extension to infinity .",
    "the mid - range power law is adjusted to match the slope of the upper end of the data and to give pleasing curves , but the choice of power ( something between 0.5 and 3 ) is arbitrary .",
    "other approaches have been put forward .",
    "one heroic method is to carry out ellipsometry on the sample over the high - energy part of the interesting spectral range and extract the ( temperature - dependent if necessary ) complex refractive index over that range .",
    "then one can calculate an oscillator - model extrapolation that forces the kramers - kronig - derived refractive index to agree with ellipsometry over the range of overlap.@xcite a second approach@xcite consists of fitting the spectrum with a sum of a very large number of narrow contributions to the dielectric function .",
    "the functions can be lorentz oscillators , triangles , or some other function for the imaginary part and the kramers - kronig - derived counterpart for the real part .",
    "the number of these functions is equal to or nearly equal to the number of data points , so that an excellent fit is easy to obtain ; indeed some parameters need to be fixed .",
    "the model dielectric function then represents the properties of the material .",
    "no actual integral of the reflectance is computed .",
    "this approach is especially effective for the case of a thin film on a substrate@xcite or a complex device structure.@xcite    this paper describes an extrapolation method for conventional kramers - kronig analysis that uses x - ray atomic scattering functions developed by henke and co - workers@xcite to generate the high - frequency reflectance of a material .",
    "the method basically treats the solid as a linear combination of its atomic constituents .",
    "knowledge of the chemical formula , the density , and the scattering function enables the computation of the dielectric function , the reflectivity , and other optical functions .",
    "the `` henke reflectivity '' is computed for photon energies of 10 ev34 kev , after which a @xmath2 continuation is perfectly fine .",
    "this paper also discusses the bridge between experimental data and the henke reflectivity as well as two corrections that needed to be made to the latter .",
    "the kramers - kronig relations@xcite are a consequence of our experience that observable effects are _ causal _ , _ i.e. , _ that the cause precedes the effect .",
    "this notion seems sensible and it is a component of most parts of physics .",
    "the kramers - kronig integrals are derived in a number of textbooks,@xcite and have been discussed by many authors.@xcite the original derivations by kramers and kronig relied on model dielectric functions;@xcite however , the subject is mostly approached by considering integrals on the complex frequency plane and using cauchy s integral theorem.@xcite this approach , combined with the fact that the material s response functions are either even or odd as a function of the frequency and a consideration of the pole that occurs in conductors when the frequency @xmath5 is zero , lead to the following relations for the dielectric susceptibility @xmath6 : @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dc conductivity and @xmath10 means `` principal value . ''",
    "there are many complex optical functions in addition to the susceptibility : dielectric function , conductivity , refractive index , _ etc _ ; there are kramers - kronig relations amongst them .",
    "( many can be obtained by substitution .",
    "for example , @xmath11 and @xmath12 so that equations [ kk4 ] and [ kk6 ] may respectively be converted to an integral containing @xmath13 that gives @xmath14 and one containing @xmath15 to give @xmath16 .",
    "others require application of cauchy s theorem to the contour integral along with statements about the behavior at very high frequencies .",
    "when i measure the reflectance , where reflectance here means the _ single - bounce _ or _ single - surface _ reflectance , @xmath17 , i am taking the ratio of the reflected intensity or power reflected from the front surface of the sample to the incident intensity or power .",
    "the sample is assumed infinitely thick or sufficiently absorbing that no light from the rear surface reaches my detector .",
    "phase information is not available .",
    "the amplitude reflectivity , the ratio of reflected electric field amplitude to incident electric field amplitude , does have a phase ; indeed , i can write it as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnitude of the reflectivity , @xmath20 is the phase shift on reflection , and @xmath21 is the complex refractive index . here , the phase is set by measuring the field vector relative to the incident vector at the surface.@xcite    it would be nice to know @xmath20 , because i could invert eq .",
    "[ rvac ] to get @xmath22 using the known @xmath20 and the measured reflectance .",
    "kramers - kronig analysis is one way of estimating this phase.@xcite consider @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the real part and @xmath25 is the imaginary part .",
    "the reflectance must be causal , and hence so must be the log of the reflectance .",
    "this requirement , plus the hermiticity of @xmath26 , @xmath27^*$ ] ( which makes @xmath28 even and @xmath20 odd ) leads to @xmath29    equation [ kk7 ] is perfectly usable for numerical analysis , but there is an improvement that can be made.@xcite consider @xmath30 the negative area for @xmath31 cancels the positive area for @xmath32 .",
    "thus , i can add @xmath33 to the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ kk7 ] without affecting the phase . collecting terms , replacing @xmath28 with @xmath34 , and using the properties of the log ,",
    "i get @xmath35 \\over { \\omega^{\\prime}}^2 - \\omega^2}. \\label{kkr}\\ ] ]    this modification has two advantages .",
    "first , if there are errors in the calibration of the reflectance measurements , so that the data for @xmath17 are in error by a constant factor , the results for @xmath20 are unaffected .",
    "( of course , even if the scale error does not affect the phase , it _ does _ affect @xmath17 , and @xmath36 , eq .",
    "[ nfromr ] , depends on both quantities . )",
    "second , both numerator and denominator of the integrand are zero when @xmath37 .",
    "lhpital s rule shows that the ratio does not diverge ; hence , the pole has been removed .",
    "the alert reader will have noticed that the range of the integral eq .",
    "[ kkr ] is 0 to @xmath38 and may wonder how one acquires data over that entire range .",
    "the answer is that data are always limited to a finite range of frequencies .",
    "thus , the user must use extrapolations outside the measured ranges .",
    "one must estimate the reflectance between zero and the lowest measured frequency . in my opinion",
    ", the best approach is to employ a model that reasonably describes the low - frequency data .",
    "such models include drude for metals , lorentz for insulators , a sum of several lorentzians , sometimes a drude plus lorentzians .",
    "many other functions exist .",
    "when a good fit of the model to the data is obtained , a set of reflectance points may be calculated between zero and the lowest measured frequency , using a spacing between points similar to that of the lowest - frequency data , and combined with the measured data .",
    "other approaches to the low - frequency extrapolations include making an assumption that the reflectance is constant to dc ( as might be appropriate for an insulator ) or using a hagen - rubens formula , @xmath39 , ( to describe a metal at low frequencies ) .",
    "other power laws can also be used .",
    "the constant @xmath40 is adjusted so the extrapolation goes through the first few points and then , using a spacing between points similar to that of the lowest - frequency data , a set of reflectance points is calculated between zero and the lowest measured frequency and combined with the measured data .",
    "the high - frequency extrapolation can be a source of major error .",
    "it is good to use data from other experiments on identical or similar samples if these exist . moving to the highest frequencies",
    ", one knows that in the limit as @xmath41 , the dielectric function is mostly real and slightly smaller than unity , following @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the plasma frequency of all the electrons in the solid and @xmath44",
    ". then @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "typically,@xcite the region between the highest - frequency data point and the transition to @xmath47 is filled with another power law , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 a free parameter .",
    "( @xmath50 does not have to be an integer . )",
    "the value of @xmath51 is chosen so that the power law joins smoothly to the data at the high frequency limit and then @xmath52 is chosen for a smooth transition between mid- and high - frequency extrapolations .",
    "the free parameters are the exponent @xmath50 and the frequency for the crossover from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the integrals in the extrapolation range may be done analytically@xcite and their contributions simply added to the phase obtained by numerical integration of eq .  [ kkr ] over the low - frequency extrapolation and the measured data .",
    "an example of `` typical '' reflectance data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ag - ins ] .",
    "the data are the reflectance of silver as collected by palik.@xcite the low frequencies are supplemented by a drude reflectance , based on resistivity @xmath55-cm at 300 k. the main panel shows the reflectance from 4040,000 @xmath0 ( 5 mev5 ev ) , a range that can be measured by many laboratories .",
    "one can see the high metallic reflectance from far - infrared to near ultraviolet , a sharp and deep plasma edge around 32,000 @xmath0 ( 4 ev ) , and the beginning of transitions from the d - bands to the conduction band above this.@xcite the inset shows the data over the entire measured range , up to about 1 kev .",
    "i will now explore the kramers - kronig analysis of the reflectance shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ag - ins ] .",
    "the issue to address is that the parameters , @xmath50 and the frequency of transition to @xmath47 , are completely free and , hence , uncontrolled .",
    "it is fair to ask : how much do they affect the outcome of the analysis ?",
    "a reason for choosing silver for this discussion is that data for this material extend to 1000 ev ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ag - ins ] ) . here , one can see additional interband transitions followed by sharp core - level transitions .",

    "the location of the maximum of this transition is pushed up in the small exponent calculations , reaching 16,000 @xmath0 ( 2 ev ) compared to 12,500 @xmath0 ( 1.55 ev ) in the conductivity derived from the full - range - data .",
    "note that the weak exponents ( which are implied by the data ) give the poorest results .",
    "an exponent of around 2.5 , which is in no way suggested by the data , gives a conductivity spectrum close to that returned by using the full reflectance spectrum .",
    "one could argue that transitioning to @xmath110 at 10@xmath57 @xmath0 ( 125 ev ) is not correct ; the full reflectance spectrum turns over at 120,000 @xmath0 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alold ] shows conductivity spectra obtained by extending the reflectance as a constant value up to a frequency @xmath113 where it changes to @xmath110 .",
    "the changeover frequency was in the range @xmath111 @xmath0 ( 1260  ev ) ; above this frequency @xmath110 .",
    "all of the curves overstate the magnitude of the conductivity , even the one where the reflectance decrease starts at 100,000 @xmath0 ( 12 ev ) , below the 150,000 @xmath0 ( 19 ev ) where the experimental edge exists .",
    "note that the initial power - law behavior of the reflectance edge ( inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : al - ins ] ) is approximately @xmath114 .    presented with the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : alold ] , i would decide that kramers - kronig analysis of the reflectance in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : al - ins ] can not be productive .",
    "however , use of the x - ray scattering function helps immensely .",
    "the relevant curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alxro3 ] .",
    "( 125 ev ) , showing the typical experimental region ( 4050,000 @xmath0 ) , data in the vacuum - ultraviolet and soft x - ray regoion@xcite , the calculated reflectance using the al scattering function , and two cubic spline bridges , one over 50,00080,000 @xmath0 ( 6.210 ev ) and one over 50,000130,000 @xmath0 ( 6.216 ev ) . ]    at first blush , the calculated reflectance from the scattering functions does not look promising . because there is no band structure , only atomic orbitals",
    ", there is no metallic reflectance ; instead a strong peak occurs around 130,000 @xmath0 ( 16 ev ) with a reflectance edge blue shifted from the experimental data . at the low end , 80,000 @xmath0 ( 10 ev )",
    ", the reflectance falls to about 1/3 of the metal s reflectance .",
    "i consider two approaches to the use of this extension .",
    "first , i can just use it , with a short , steeply declining bridge joining the `` ir data '' to the scattering - function extension .",
    "second , i can lop off the low energy part of the extension , and bridge to the maximum around 130,000 @xmath0 ( 16 ev ) , making the smallest change in reflectance between data and extension .",
    "surprisingly , both approaches give rather similar optical conductivity curves ( and sum rule results ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : als4br ] .",
    "the short bridge falls a little bit below the conductivity obtained from the full set of data while the long bridge is a bit above .",
    "i could use either ( or their average ! ) to discuss the low frequency electronic structure of aluminum without being plagued by extrapolation - dependent results .",
    "that the scattering - function extrapolation works as well as it does suggests that the critical issue in designing the extrapolation is to use one that gets the correct high - energy spectral weight for the material and then places that spectral weight appropriately in energy .",
    "the remaining details are not important .",
    "the use of reflectance calculated from a dielectric function constructed from a sum of atomic scattering functions for a material provides a reliable and reproducible method of extrapolating measured data .",
    "it removes a certain amount of arbitrariness in the use of kramers - kronig analysis .",
    "in addition to testing with data where the uv  x - ray spectra are known , this extrapolation has been used in a number of recent studies.@xcite a comparison with a method that uses ellipsometry in the near - infrared  ultraviolet to constrain the extrapolation@xcite gave conductivity spectra indistinguishable from those of figs .  [ fig : s1br ] and [ fig : lsnew2 ] . for al ,",
    "the ellipsometry - based method gave a slightly ( 5% ) higher conductivity over the entire range ; the difference was about the same as that between the two bridge versions in fig .",
    "[ fig : alxro3 ] .    persons who wish to test the approach will find a windows program to compute the reflectance in the uv  x - ray region , the kramers - kronig routine that uses the extrapolation and generates the bridge function , and a program that computes optical constants from reflectance and phase at |http://www.phys.ufl.edu/  tanner / zips / xro.zip| .",
    "use xro.exe to generate the file for extrapolation , kk.exe to do the kramers - kronig integral , and op.exe to calculate optical functions .",
    "note that to avoid having @xmath115 swings in the phase when its value is close to @xmath116 and there is noise , the kk.exe and op.exe programs respectively compute and use @xmath117 .",
    "see the discussion in endnote  .",
    "i ve had important discussion about this method with ric lobo , tom timusk , and dirk ven der marel .",
    "claus jacobsen wrote the kramers - kronig routine i use and charles porter wrote many of the routines used by the data analysis code .",
    "naween anand , chang long , catalin martin , kevin miller , zahra nasrollahi , evan thatcher , berik uzakbaiuly , and luyi yan were very helpful in testing the method on data they have measured .",

    "<S> kramers - kronig analysis is commonly used to estimate the optical properties of new materials . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis typically uses data from far infrared through near ultraviolet ( say , 4040,000 @xmath0 or 5 mev5 ev ) and uses extrapolations outside the measured range . </S>",
    "<S> most high - frequency extrapolations use a power law , 1/@xmath1 , transitioning to @xmath2 at a considerably higher frequency and continuing this free - carrier extension to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the mid - range power law is adjusted to match the slope of the data and to give pleasing curves , but the choice of power ( usually between 0.5 and 3 ) is arbitrary . instead of an arbitrary power law , it is is better to use x - ray atomic scattering functions such as those presented by henke and co - workers . these basically treat the solid as a linear combinations of its atomic constituents and , knowing the chemical formula and the density , allow the computation of dielectric function , reflectivity , and other optical functions . </S>",
    "<S> the `` henke reflectivity '' can be used over photon energies of 10 ev34 kev , after which a @xmath2 continuation is perfectly fine . </S>",
    "<S> the bridge between experimental data and the henke reflectivity as well as two corrections that needed to be made to the latter are discussed . </S>"
