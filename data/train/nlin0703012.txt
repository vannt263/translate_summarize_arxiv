    "the abstract setting of evolution equations in fields like chemistry , biology , population dynamics , financial mathematics and similar subjects can be formulated as follows : the state of the system is given by @xmath0 positive numbers @xmath2 , which sum to unity and may be interpreted as probabilities , as relative populations , or financial assets .",
    "their time dependence is governed by a dynamical equation , which expresses the time change of @xmath2 by the value of all the @xmath3 .",
    "the basic question is whether in the course of time the state will purify ( which means that one @xmath2 will tend to unity and all the others to zero ) or will become completely mixed ( all @xmath2 become equal to @xmath4 ) . to measure this tendency",
    ", we use the quadratic entropy @xcite @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath5 vanishes for a pure state , it is @xmath7 for the completely mixed state , and is in between otherwise .",
    "the evolution equations are constructed such that the basic properties of the @xmath2 are preserved and their values asymptotically tend to a limit independent of the initial conditions . however , this limit will depend on the coefficients @xmath8 appearing in the evolution equation as shown below .",
    "they are supposed to be determined by the accidental circumstances of the system and should be considered as random numbers .",
    "the basic issue therefore is , whether the asymptotic values for @xmath5 , taken as a function of these coefficients , tend to cluster around zero , or around @xmath7 .",
    "correspondingly , we say that these evolution equations are either purifying or mixing .",
    "we answer this question for the simplest type of evolution equation which , speaking financially , says the following : per unit time each player @xmath9 receives the fraction @xmath8 of the assets of the players @xmath10 .",
    "then , there is an overall tax such that the total amount of money remains unity .",
    "if we take all the @xmath8 to be random numbers between 0 and 1 , we find that the asymptotic values for @xmath5 cluster just below @xmath7 , and this distribution is the sharper the bigger the dimension @xmath0 .",
    "only for special classes of @xmath8 they cluster near zero .",
    "this means that one can make a fortune only by an intelligent strategy , or that the  survival of the fittest  only holds under special circumstances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_equation ] we define our model and outline the numerical procedure for the computation of the entropy @xmath5 . in section [ sec_results ]",
    "we summarize our numerical results for three to eight dimensional systems .",
    "the qualitative behavior is already apparent for the two - dimensional case , which may be solved analytically .",
    "this is demonstrated in section [ sec_theory ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec_fitness ] with some remarks on fitness and the quantum - mechanical generalization .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional dynamical system with a state vector @xmath11 which evolves according to @xmath12 the coefficients @xmath8 are elements of a @xmath1 matrix @xmath13 and are assumed to be strictly positive random variables with upper bounds specified below . from the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq_fisher ] ) , @xmath14 _ i } ~\\mbox { , }         \\label{eq_sol}\\ ] ] it follows that the vector @xmath15 is constrained to the simplex @xmath16 , @xmath17 provided the initial point is also contained in @xmath16 , @xmath18 .",
    "the state @xmath15 may be regarded as a @xmath0-dimensional probability distribution .",
    "the dynamics of equation ( [ eq_fisher ] ) is closely related to the quasi - species equation introduced by eigen and schuster @xcite , which has been extensively studied in the past @xcite .",
    "it also corresponds to the evolution equation introduced by nowak , komarova and niyogi for the study of language learning by children @xcite . in terms of chemical reaction kinetics , it models evolutionary dynamics based on selection and mutation .    @xmath13 is considered a matrix and , therefore , is similar to an orthogonal sum of matrices in a jordan normal form , @xmath19 where the sum is over all jordan blocks corresponding to different eigenvalues of @xmath13 with degeneracy @xmath20 , and @xmath5 is the shift , @xmath21 the matrix @xmath22 is diagonal in each @xmath23 jordan block . @xmath24",
    "can easily be calculated , because @xmath22 and @xmath5 commute and @xmath25 .",
    "since the off - diagonal elements of @xmath13 are assumed here to be strictly positive , the perron - frobenius theorem applies . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum eigenvalue , @xmath26 , of @xmath13 is always non degenerate and strictly positive , @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector , @xmath28 , is real and positive .",
    "the associated jordan block is one - dimensional .",
    "it follows that the leading term of the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq_sol ] ) , for @xmath29 , is @xmath30 .",
    "the exponential is cancelled by an analogous expression for the denominator .",
    "we conclude from eq .",
    "( [ eq_sol ] ) that the asymptotic equilibrium is determined by the eigenvector @xmath28 belonging to @xmath26 and is normalized according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_simplex ] ) and , thus , confined to the simplex @xmath16 : @xmath31 this asymptotic solution is simply denoted by @xmath15 for the remainder of this paper .    to quantify the asymptotic behavior of the system , we use the quadratic entropy defined in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) , which is bounded , @xmath32 the upper bound corresponds to a maximally _ mixed _ state , where all the @xmath2 are equal , @xmath33 .",
    "we say the dynamics is maximally mixing , if this state is approached for @xmath29 .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath5 corresponds to a _",
    "pure _ state , where only one component of @xmath15 approaches unity and all the others vanish .",
    "accordingly , the dynamics is said to be maximally purifying , if such a state is asymptotically reached .",
    "we say the system is ( predominantly ) mixing or purifying , if the distribution @xmath34 is peaked at or near the respective upper or lower bound .",
    "in the following we consider classes of random matrices @xmath13 with strictly positive elements , and determine the asymptotic behavior of the system by computing the normalized entropy distribution @xmath34 , @xmath35 , for each class . this is achieved by numerically diagonalyzing ( typically @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) reaction - rate matrices @xmath13 and constructing the entropy histogram from the re - normalized eigenvectors , eq .",
    "( [ as_sol ] ) , belonging to the respective maximum eigenvalues . for the classification of @xmath13",
    "we distinguish between i ) diagonal elements ( d ) , ii ) elements above the diagonal ( u ) , and iii ) elements below the diagonal ( l ) .",
    "the elements are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution such that an upper bound exists for each group : @xmath38 we specify various classes of @xmath13 by @xmath39 and @xmath40      first we consider in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the most random case , where the upper bounds for all matrix elements are the same , @xmath42 .",
    "the dimension @xmath0 is varied from 2 to 10 . not surprisingly , the off - diagonal elements are responsible for effective mixing , and the distributions @xmath34 are sharply peaked near their most - random edge , @xmath7 . for @xmath43 they become narrower for increasing @xmath0 , and are expected to approach @xmath44 for @xmath45 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the diagonal elements for a three - dimensional system are bounded by unity , @xmath48 .",
    "various entropy distributions are shown , for which the bounds for the off - diagonal elements are equal , @xmath49 , and are varied from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "note the logarithmic scale .",
    "the system is clearly purifying if the off - digonal elements are small .",
    "however , it becomes mxing for @xmath52 .",
    "this transition takes place for smaller values of @xmath49 , if the dimension of the system is larger .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath53 .",
    "we stick with three dimensions and consider the case where the bound for the upper off - diagonal elements is fixed , @xmath57 , whereas the respective bound for the lower off - diagonal elements is varied in steps over a huge range , @xmath58 .",
    "the top and bottom figures of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] differ by the choice of @xmath54 , the upper bound of the diagonal elements . in the top figure",
    ", @xmath54 is set to vanish , whereas in the figure at the bottom @xmath54 is set to unity . although the off - diagonal elements may be small , they are still strictly positive and the conditions of section [ sec_equation ] still apply .",
    "one infers from the top of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that for vanishing @xmath54 the system - very gradually - becomes more purifying , if the ratio of upper bounds @xmath59 becomes large or small . in the limit @xmath60 the system is strictly purifying ,",
    "although the convergence towards this state is slow as we have verified by direct integration of the equations of motion ( [ eq_fisher ] ) .",
    "the entropy distributions very often have peaks which belong to mixed substructures with a lower dimension ( such as at @xmath61 in fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this feature may be observed with many other examples given in this paper .    to complement these results for three - dimensional systems ,",
    "we show in figure [ fig5 ] how the shape of the entropy distribution depends on the upper bound of the diagonal elements @xmath54 .",
    "again , @xmath57 , whereas the upper bound for the lower off - diagonal elements , @xmath55 , is @xmath62 , @xmath50 , and @xmath63 for the figures from top to bottom , respectively .",
    "the surprising result is that for already rather small ( but strictly positive ) matrix elements below the diagonal ( for @xmath64 at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , the system is mixing for small and vanishing ( not shown ) @xmath54 , where the rather broad maximum of the entropy distribution only very slowly moves towards the purifying case @xmath65 for much smaller values of @xmath55 .",
    "( middle and bottom figure ) .",
    "this results also applies for higher dimensions . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the eight - dimensional analogue to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where again @xmath34 is shown for various @xmath54 , where @xmath66 is unity , and @xmath55 varies from @xmath62 to @xmath67    for the figures from top to bottom . only for @xmath68 the system becomes strictly purifying for small @xmath54 .",
    "in an attempt to understand some of the details of this complicated behavior , we turn to the two - dimensional case , @xmath69 , which may be solved analytically , at least in principle .",
    "the behavior in two dimensions is qualitatively the same as for higher dimensions .",
    "this is demonstrated by the simulation results in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where entropy densities are shown for various @xmath54 varying over many orders of magnitude , and for bounds @xmath55 , decreasing , from top to bottom , from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is bounded between 0 and 0.5 in this case .",
    "the @xmath72 matrix of rate constants is written @xmath73 where , in accordance with eq .",
    "[ dul ] , the strictly positive elements are taken to be bounded by @xmath74 the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath13 is @xmath75 according to sec .",
    "[ sec_equation ] , the corresponding ( properly normalized ) eigenvector @xmath15 with components @xmath76 gives the asymptotic state of the system . from the eigenvalue equation",
    "@xmath77 it immediately follows that the ratio @xmath78 , \\label{constraint}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 , only depends on the difference of the diagonal elements .",
    "the bounds for @xmath80 follow from those for @xmath81 , eq . [ bounds ] , @xmath82 since @xmath22 and @xmath0 are assumed to be uniformly distributed , @xmath80 has a triangular distribution , @xmath83    the ratio @xmath84 is another indicator for mixing : a pure state corresponds to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and the maximally mixed state has @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 is related to the quadratic entropy by @xmath89 once the normalized distribution for @xmath88 , @xmath90 , is known , the corresponding entropy distribution @xmath34 follows from @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is used for the branch @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for the branch @xmath95 : @xmath96 the distribution for @xmath88 is obtained from @xmath97 here , the @xmath98-function takes care of the constraining relation eq .",
    "[ constraint ] between @xmath88 and the matrix elements @xmath99 and @xmath80 , and may be rewritten according to @xmath100 without loss of generality we consider @xmath101 since @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the unit step function , the distribution for @xmath88 becomes @xmath104 with the transformation @xmath105 one obtains @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the domain for the remaining integration in the @xmath109 plane is the intersection of a rectangle , defined by @xmath110 , and of a strip given by @xmath111 . for the general case this domain",
    "is slightly involved . here ,",
    "we confine ourselves to a specific situation , which is readily solved .",
    "for example , we take @xmath57 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the simulation results for this particular case are marked by an arrow in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . under these conditions , @xmath90 becomes a maximum for @xmath114 , for which @xmath115 and the overlap of the rectangle with the strip is maximized .",
    "for the regime of very large @xmath88 , @xmath116 , a direct evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ finalrho ] ) gives @xmath117 .",
    "since only @xmath92 contributes , the entropy distribution is given by the first term of eq .",
    "( [ jacobian ] ) .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath5 , one finds @xmath118 for @xmath119 , which agrees well with the numerical results .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .     +    for the regime of slightly smaller @xmath88 , @xmath120 , a similar evaluation of the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ finalrho ] ) yields @xmath121 and , hence , @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "again , this is in complete agreement with the numerical data ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that all the details of the two - dimensional entropy distributions in figure [ fig7 ] are accessible to analytical computation .",
    "this is of some significance because of the qualitative similarity with the results for higher dimensions .",
    "if the evolution equations of eq . [ eq_fisher ] are written as @xmath124 the global fitness of the state , @xmath125 evolves according to @xmath126 it increases if @xmath13 is diagonal .",
    "our results so far can readily be generalized to the quantum mechanical setting @xcite , where the distribution @xmath127 is replaced by a density matrix @xmath128 which obeys @xmath129 @xmath130 is a sort of hamilton operator , and @xmath131 is its hermitian adjoint .",
    "the solution is almost the same as in the classical case before , @xmath132^{-1},\\ ] ] just observe the non - commutativity of the operators .",
    "entropy @xmath5 and fitness @xmath133 generalize to @xmath134 with @xmath135.\\ ] ] thus , the increase in fitness means convexity of the function @xmath136 .",
    "the increase of @xmath133 for diagonal @xmath13 in the classical case becomes now the following + * proposition * : + @xmath133 is increasing if @xmath130 is hermitian .",
    "+ * proof * : + the evolution equation ( [ quantumevol ] ) tells us generally @xmath137(h + h^{\\dagger } ) .\\ ] ] for hermitian @xmath130 this becomes four times @xmath138 .",
    "the generalization of the schwartz inequality to traces of operator products implies @xmath139 which gives @xmath140 for all @xmath128 .",
    "* remarks * :    \\1 ) without hermiticity , @xmath133 need not increase . this appears already for a nilpotent @xmath130 , @xmath141 .",
    "then @xmath142 and @xmath143 = \\ln \\makebox{tr } [ ( 1+th+ th^{\\dagger } +       t^2 h h^{\\dagger } ) \\rho]\\ ] ] is no longer convex in @xmath144 .",
    "\\2 ) the schwarz inequality becomes an equality only if the two vectors are proportional .",
    "therefore the proof tells us that the fitness keeps increasing unless @xmath128 projects onto an eigenvector of @xmath130 . of these",
    ", only the one with the highest eigenvalue has the biggest @xmath133 and , therefore , is an attractor . excluding degeneracy this means that then also the entropy goes to zero and the system becomes pure .",
    "@xmath5 can not be a lyapunov function , because near a repellor it will be very small , so it has to increase only to decrease again near the attractor .",
    "\\3 ) the situation is just the converse for the lindblad dynamics @xcite , which provides a consistent description of a dissipative quantum system @xcite : @xmath145 this equation is linear in @xmath128 but quadratic in @xmath130 .",
    "there , the fitness @xmath146 increases for a nilpotent @xmath130 , @xmath147 , and is constant for @xmath148 .",
    "the motivation for this study was to see , whether the nonlinear evolution equations let order emerge from chaos purely by accident .",
    "the answer depends where we let chance act .",
    "our results can be simply stated as follows : according to eq .",
    "( [ dul ] ) the matrix space is spanned by three parts , the diagonal matrices ( d ) , and the upper ( u ) and lower ( l ) triangular matrices .",
    "matrices taken from solely one of these subalgebras give a purifying dynamics , but admixture of a small fraction of another part renders the dynamics mixing . since zero is not a random number , these subalgebras are never pure , but we keep the admixtures so small that they do not matter .",
    "these features can be easily understood in the financial setting . there , the @xmath2 are the assets of party @xmath9 , and the rules of the game are that per unit time party @xmath149 gives the ratio @xmath150 of its asset to party @xmath9 .",
    "this money is not deducted from its account since the @xmath150 are strictly positive , but , instead , there is a flat tax which keeps the total amount of money fixed .",
    "the diagonal elements correspond to the case where each party makes its own investments and eventually the one with the highest interest rate becomes the richest .",
    "the triangular dynamics means that there is an order between the parties , and money is handed only from parties of lower order to the ones of higher order .",
    "obviously , the one on top of this order pyramid eventually wins .",
