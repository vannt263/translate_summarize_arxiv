    "the atomic fine structure lines [ cii](158  @xmath0 m ) , [ nii](122 and 205  @xmath0 m ) , [ oi](63 and 145  @xmath0 m ) and [ oiii](88  @xmath0 m ) are among the dominant cooling lines of the cold neutral and ionized regimes of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the progenitor atoms of these lines are collisionally excited then de - excite through forbidden transitions , emitting photons and thus removing thermal energy from the gas .",
    "the [ oi ] lines originate in the neutral regime of photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) @xcite as atomic oxygen has an ionization potential greater than 13.6  ev , while [ cii ] emission , though considered a primary tracer of pdrs , can also trace ionized gas as the ionization potential of atomic carbon is only 11.26  ev .",
    "in contrast , the [ nii ] and [ oiii ] lines only trace ionized gas , particularly in hii regions , because the ionization potentials of n and o@xmath5 are 14.5 and 35  ev , respectively , requiring the presence of a hard radiation field .",
    "thus , observations of these lines can tell us important characteristics about the gas in these components of the ism .",
    "observationally , these cooling lines were first detectable with the _ kuiper airborne observatory _ ( kao ) and the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , and are now observable with the _ herschel space observatory _ at unprecedented resolution .",
    "previous surveys studied [ cii](158  @xmath0 m ) , [ nii](122  @xmath0 m ) , and [ oi](63  @xmath0 m ) on global scales in galaxies using iso and found a decreasing ratio of @xmath6}}$]/@xmath7 with increasing infrared colour , @xmath8 , as well as a correlation between @xmath963}}$]/@xmath10}}$ ] and infrared colour .",
    "@xmath6}}$]/@xmath7 is used as a probe of the photo - electric heating efficiency of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation field , indicating the fraction of fuv photons that contributes to dust heating via absorption , versus the fraction responsible for ejecting electrons from dust grains or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) @xcite , which thermally heat the gas .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 indicates dust temperatures , with higher temperatures indicating compact hii regions .",
    "these studies concluded the trends seen indicate a decrease in this heating efficiency with increasing color .",
    "more recently these cooling lines have been probed on galactic and spatially resolved scales in nearby galaxies with _ herschel _ . , and investigated the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  1097 , m33 and the hii region lmc - n11 , respectively , and found that @xmath6}}$]/@xmath7 varies on local scales as well .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and also see the same relationship between @xmath6+[oi]63}}$]/@xmath7 and infrared colour that is seen on global scales .",
    "interestingly , they also investigated the ratio @xmath6+[oi]63}}$]/@xmath11 as a function of color , and found there was a stronger correlation between these two parameters than between @xmath6+[oi]63}}$]/@xmath7 versus color , implying pahs are likely a better indicator of heating efficiency than the total infrared luminosity within the gas . at the warmest colors ,",
    "@xmath6+[oi]63}}$]/@xmath11 decreased slightly and the authors attributed this to the pahs becoming increasingly ionized , thus reducing their ability to eject photoelectrons .",
    "diagnosing the physical conditions of the gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) using these important cooling lines requires comparing the observed fluxes to those predicted by a pdr model .",
    "@xcite presented a pdr model that characterises the physical conditions in the pdr by two free variables , the hydrogen nucleus density , @xmath4 , and the strength of the fuv radiation field in units of the habing field , @xmath12  erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "they assume a slab geometry and include a complex chemical network , thermal balance and radiative transfer . in successive papers , @xcite and @xcite expanded this work to model ensembles of molecular clouds in diffuse environments as well as galactic nuclei and agn .",
    "@xcite have further updated the model of @xcite and provide a set of diagnostic plots using ratios between cooling lines and the total infrared luminosity to determine @xmath4 and @xmath15 .",

    "pdr models with a spherical geometry instead of the plane - parallel geometry also exist , such as kosma  @xmath16 .",
    "for a recent discussion and comparison of the different available pdr models see .",
    "a number of studies have compared observations to pdr models to determine the gas density , temperature and strength of the fuv radiation field in numerous galaxies and galactic pdrs .",
    "when they compared their observations to the pdr model of @xcite , @xcite found the fuv radiation field , @xmath1 , scales as the hydrogen nucleus density , @xmath4 , to the power 1.4 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 for their sample of galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied ngc  1097 as well as ngc  4559 , and found @xmath19 across both galactic disks , with @xmath20 .",

    "the metallicity ( 12+log(o / h ) ) of m51 is @xmath22 on average and has a slight radial gradient @xcite , though it does not change significantly over the area covered in this work .",
    "m51 has been previously observed with the kao and iso to investigate the far - infrared cooling lines .",
    "@xcite mapped the [ cii](158  @xmath0 m ) line in the inner @xmath23 of the galaxy with the far - infrared imaging fabry - perot interferometer on the kao at @xmath24 resolution ( @xmath252.6  kpc at our adopted distance ) .",

    "they find that there was a burst of star formation approximately @xmath33  myr ago , a gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath34 ( the milky way has a gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath35 @xcite ) , and an interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) within the spiral arms of approximately 5 to 10 times the average value of the ambient isrf in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "we also note that the @xmath2 we use for our comparison to the @xcite model is equivalent to their bolometric far - infrared flux .        with the exception of the nucleus , all of the data points tend to cluster around one locus and approximately one third of the pixels fall outside of the parameter space covered by the models .",
    "the [ cii]/[oi]63 vs. ( [ cii]+[oi]63)/@xmath2 parameter space actually provides two possible model solutions .",
    "one is a low-@xmath15 , high-@xmath4 regime and the other is a regime with more moderate values for both parameters .",
    "we do not display the low-@xmath15 , high-@xmath4 solutions as we can eliminate these solutions by considering the number of clouds emitting within our beam .",
    "when we compare the model predicted [ cii ] emission based on the values of @xmath15 and @xmath4 to our observed [ cii ] emission , we find that we would require a filling factor ( i.e. the number of pdr regions ) of upwards of @xmath131 , which is an unreasonably large number of clouds along the line of sight .",
    "this is the same reasoning used by to eliminate the low-@xmath15 , high-@xmath4 solution .",
    "thus , for the remaining discussion we consider only the moderate @xmath4 and @xmath1 solutions .",
    "a proper comparison to the pdr model of @xcite requires us to make two adjustments .",
    "the first is to remove the fraction of [ cii ] emission from ionized gas , as the model only applies to [ cii ] emission from pdrs .",
    "we use the results from section  [ ionized_gas_contribution ] to correct our [ cii ] map .",
    "the second correction is applied to the [ oi]63 map .",
    "the @xcite model is a plane - parallel slab that only experiences an incident radiation field on one side , which is the same side from which we observe emission from the far - infrared cooling lines . in the case of m51 , there are many clouds within a given pacs beam and the irradiated side of an individual cloud is not always oriented such that it is facing us .",
    "@xcite caution that the velocity dispersion for such an ensemble of clouds combined with the assumption that the [ oi]63 line will become optically thick much faster than either the [ cii ] line or the total infrared flux means we observe only [ oi]63 flux emitted from clouds with their front ( lit ) sides facing towards us , but we will observe [ cii ] and total infrared flux from all clouds .",
    "thus , we only see about half of the total [ oi]63 emission from all pdrs within our beam , and as a result we multiply the observed [ oi]63 emission by a factor of two for comparison with the pdr model .",
    "the resulting parameter space after the [ cii ] and [ oi]63 results have been corrected is shown in figure  [ fig : ciionoivsciioionlfir ] ( _ right _ ) , and the values for @xmath4 and @xmath15 are presented in table  [ table : pdr_model_results ] .",
    "comparing the two panels of figure  [ fig : ciionoivsciioionlfir ] , we can see that after applying the appropriate corrections to the [ cii ] and [ oi]63 emission there is a general shift of pixels to lower values of ( [ cii]+[oi]63)/@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , pixels from the center and nuclear regions have decreased more in [ cii]/[oi]63 , as expected .",
    "looking at table  [ table : pdr_model_results ] , we see an increase in @xmath4 by approximately an order of magnitude for all four regions after we apply our corrections .",
    "likewise , log@xmath15 increases by @xmath25 1.5 .",
    "lccccc uncorrected & nucleus & 2.25 - 2.75 & 2.0 - 2.5 & 170 - 320 + & center & 1.5 - 2.75 & 1.0 - 2.5 & 70 - 1070 + & arms & 1.5 - 3.0 & 1.0 - 2.25 & 60 - 820 + & interarm & 1.5 - 3.25 & 0.75 - 2.25 & 50 - 820 + corrected & nucleus & 3.5 - 4.25 & 3.25 - 4.0 & 240 - 475 + & center & 2.5 - 4.0 & 2.5 - 3.5 & 170 - 680 + & arms & 2.0 - 3.75 & 1.75 - 3.0 & 100 - 760 + & interarm & 2.25 - 3.75 & 1.5 - 3.0 & 80 - 550 +    we use our derived values for @xmath4 and @xmath1 to determine the range in the surface temperature of the gas using figure  1 from @xcite .",
    "the temperatures for the uncorrected [ cii ] and [ oi]63 observations as well as for the full corrected case are given in table  [ table : pdr_model_results ] .",
    "in general , the cloud surface temperatures increase after the corrections are applied , while there is a decrease in temperature from the central region to the interarm region .      the [ oi]63 emission peaks in the nucleus of m51 , and as a result [ cii]/[oi]63 is lower in the center than in the rest of the galaxy . in addition , the [ oiii ] line is also brightest in the nucleus and center regions , thus indicating higher densities and warmer temperatures in the center of the galaxy .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our pdr modelling , but it is also possible that some of the [ oi]63 emission from the nucleus is not arising from starlight but rather from shock heating . once the temperature of the gas behind a shock front has cooled down to below 5000  k , the [ oi]63 line dominates the cooling for densities below @xmath197  @xmath28 @xcite . if indeed some of the [ oi]63 emission did arise from shocks rather than stellar radiation in pdrs , then this correction would mean that the [ cii]/[oi]63 ratio attributable to pdrs would increase in the center of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the data point(s ) in figure  [ fig : ciionoivsciioionlfir ] would shift upwards and to the left in the parameter space , thus decreasing the gas density , and possibly the value of @xmath1 as well , although quantifying this effect would be difficult . as a result",
    "the gradient we observe in density and radiation field due to pdrs would become less prominent .",
    "we also note here that some of the total infrared flux may originate in non - pdr regions such as hii regions .",
    "reducing this flux would move our data points higher in figure  [ fig : ciionoivsciioionlfir ] .",
    "the range of densities , temperatures and fuv radiation field strengths presented in table  [ table : pdr_model_results ] agree with the range of temperatures that we obtain for the [ oi]63/[oi]145 line ratio if the [ oi]63 line is optically thick ( @xmath128  k ) . in calculating these results , we have assumed that the corrections we applied to our observations of the fine structure lines ( i.e. removing the [ cii ] emission originating from diffuse ionized gas and accounting for [ oi]63 emission escaping away from our line of sight ) and the total infrared flux ( reducing the total observed flux by a factor of two to remove emission originating from the back side of or even beyond the cloud ) are correct for comparing our observations to the pdr model .",
    "however , it is possible that some of the remaining @xmath2 emission originates from regions other than pdrs ( such as hii regions or the diffuse ism ) , meaning less than half of the total observed flux comes from pdrs . in such a case , the data points in the `` corrected '' panel of figure  [ fig : ciionoivsciioionlfir ] would shift to the right , thus resulting in lower values of @xmath1 and higher densities .",
    "looking at this figure we see that we can only reduce the fraction of @xmath2 originating in pdrs to approximately 1/8 of the total observed infrared flux before our data would no longer be consistent with the pdr model .",
    "thus , our data and analysis are consistent with at least 12% and at most 50% of @xmath2 arising from pdrs in m51 .",
    "our values of @xmath4 and @xmath1 are in good agreement with previous extragalactic surveys .",
    "furthermore , our results agree with resolved studies of individual galaxies .",
    "however , none of these studies shows a decreasing trend with radius such as we show here , not only because of resolution constraints , but also because most previous work has not looked at variations with region within an individual galaxy . searched within the center of m51 as well as two positions in the spiral arms with iso ; however , they were unable to resolve any differences between the three locations .",
    "we see that the arm and interarm regions have approximately the same range of @xmath1 and @xmath4 despite lower star formation rate surface densities in the interarm region .",
    "this may indicate that molecular clouds and star formation are similar in the arm and interarm regions , but there are just fewer clouds per unit area in the interarm regions . to confirm this result",
    "we have calculated the mean values of [ cii]/[oi]63 and ( [ cii]+[oi]63)/@xmath2 for each region and compared them to the pdr model .",

    "the ratio of the observed radiation field versus that from the pdr model , @xmath206/@xmath1 , gives us a filling factor for the clouds within each beam .",
    "we find filling factors of roughly 27 , 1020 , 1020 , and 48% for the nucleus , center , arm and interarm regions .",
    "the lower filling factor in the interarm region is consistent with our theory that there are fewer clouds in this region than in the spiral arms .",
    "next , we compare the model predicted values of @xmath1 to the value of the fuv field determined using dust sed modelling by @xcite .",
    "they model the sed using the model of @xcite , which parameterizes the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) with @xmath168 , a scaling factor of the average milky way isrf spectrum , @xmath210 from .",
    "we note here that the conversion between @xmath168 and @xmath1 is @xmath168 = 0.88@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the ambient isrf is represented in the dust sed model by @xmath211 .",
    "in addition , the model has a `` pdr '' component that represents a stronger radiation field due to massive stars .",
    "this component comprises a sum of intensities with @xmath168 scaling factors ranging between @xmath211 and 10@xmath212 .",
    "@xcite find that the typical isrf in m51 is @xmath255 to 10 times that of the average value in the milky way and their analysis covers the central region of the galaxy where we have mapped our fine - structure lines .",
    "they also determined that the pdr component contributes at most about 2% of the total radiation field within the same region .",
    "ideally , we would make a direct comparison between @xmath1 measured in this work and the total strength of the radiation field measured within the pdr component as measured by the dust sed model .",
    "however , this value was not reported by @xcite .",
    "but we do point out that the dust sed modelling suggests only 2% of the dust content is exposed to the strong pdr component whereas we find that at least 12% of the total dust continuum emission originates in pdrs .",
    "this difference may arise due to the different concept of a pdr in each model .",
    "the @xcite picture adopts a pdr as any region within the ism where fuv photons have a significant effect on the chemistry in that region , which can include regions with weak ( i.e. ambient ) values of @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand , the dust sed model of @xcite assumes the pdr component is exposed to a radiation field above the ambient field , and thus may overlook some pdr regions as defined by the @xcite model .",
    "our models produce in some sense an average measure of @xmath1 over all regions within a single pacs beam ( including regions with both low and high fuv radiation field strengths ) , and so perhaps it is not surprising that our measured values of @xmath1 are larger than the value of @xmath211 .",
    "we present new _ herschel _",

    "we find a [ cii]/@xmath2 ratio of @xmath3 on average , consistent with previous results for m51 , as well as other nearby galaxies in various surveys and resolved studies .",
    "furthermore , we see a slight deficit in this ratio in the central region of m51 when compared to the surrounding environment , and the ( [ cii]+[oi]63)/@xmath2 ratio suggests reduced heating efficiency in these central regions . we also find that the [ nii]122/[nii]205 ratio indicates that diffuse ionized gas dominates these emission lines .",
    "we divide the disk of m51 into four regions to conduct a pixel - by - pixel analysis in each region to investigate possible variations within the properties of the interstellar gas .",
    "we determine that the fraction of ionized gas contributing to the total observed [ cii ] emission is approximately 80% in the nucleus of the galaxy and decreases to 50% in the arm and interarm regions .",
    "the [ oi]145/[oi]63 ratio indicates the [ oi]63 line is optically thick in the inner region of m51 .",
    "we correct for both the [ oi ] optical depth and the ionized contribution to the [ cii ] emission in our analysis .",

    "furthermore , we find that the arm and interarm regions , despite having different star formation rate surface densities and physical processes , show approximately the same incident fuv field and density within their molecular clouds .",
