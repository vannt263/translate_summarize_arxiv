    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provides the earliest obtainable direct information about the universe .",
    "upcoming experiments ( see , e.g. , map 1996 ; planck 1996 ) will map cmb temperature and polarization fluctuations with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "recent analyses have demonstrated that such maps contain a wealth of cosmological information , allowing a high - precision determination of the fundamental cosmological parameters ( jungman et al .",
    "1996a , b ; zaldarriaga et al .",
    "1997 ; bond et al . 1997 ; kamionkowski and kosowsky 1997 ) and a clean separation of inflationary and topological defect models of structure formation ( pen et al . 1997 ; hu and white 1997 ) .",
    "these exciting prospects will keep the cmb at the forefront of cosmology for the coming decade .",
    "most theoretical and experimental results to date have focussed on the angular power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "if the temperature and polarization fluctuations are gaussian , then the power spectrum contains all available information about the fluctuations ; even if the fluctuations depart from gaussian , the power spectrum is still a valuable and fundamental characterization of the fluctuations . for experiments on large angular scales , notably the dmr maps from the cobe satellite ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) , homogeneity of the universe essentially guarantees a gaussian anisotropy distribution via the central limit theorem since the experiment only probes scales outside of the causal horizon at last scattering ( for a relevant discussion , see scherrer and schaefer 1995 ) .",
    "probes of the anisotropies at resolutions of one degree and smaller hold the possibility of uncovering non - gaussian signatures . theoretically , gaussian fluctuations are well motivated , as inflation generically produces gaussian - distributed scalar and tensor metric perturbations ( guth and pi 1982 ; starobinskii 1982 ; hawking 1982 ; bardeen et al . 1983 ) , although this prediction can be circumvented in some unusual models ( allen et al . 1987 ; salopek et al .",
    "measurement of gaussian fluctuation statistics at all angular scales would clear a major hurdle for inflation ; conversely , discovery of cosmological non - gaussianity would cast strong doubt on the inflationary scenario .",
    "if the universe is not described by an inflationary model , non - gaussianity will be an important clue in unraveling the nature of the primordial density perturbations .",
    "a variety of techniques have been applied so far to test for gaussianity in cmb data , primarily cobe maps .",
    "the two - point correlation function is equivalent to the fluctuation power spectrum . in principle , the higher - order correlation functions provide a complete test of gaussianity ; indeed , a gaussian distribution can be defined as one in which the odd ( 3-point , 5-point , etc . )",
    "correlations are all zero , while the even correlation functions all factorize into products of two - point functions .",
    "kogut et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , following earlier analysis of the 2-year maps ( smoot et al . 1994 ) and theoretical work ( luo and schramm 1993 ; luo 1994 ) , have calculated certain 3-point functions for the cobe 4-year maps , finding the data consistent with zero ( gaussian ) .",
    "a drawback of analyzing n - point correlation functions is that computation time becomes prohibitive for higher - point functions unless restricted to specific fixed configurations of points , which provides a weaker test of gaussianity than the most general case .",
    "also , higher - point analysis of maps with complicated boundaries presents further difficulties .",
    "another , more heuristic statistic is the two - point correlation of temperature extrema ( peaks and valleys ) , introduced by bond and efstathiou ( 1987 ) , who provide analytic approximations to the correlation function for noiseless gaussian random fields .",
    "the cobe 4-year maps are also consistent with gaussianity for this statistic ( kogut et al .",
    "finally , substantial attention has been focussed on the topological genus of temperature contours ( coles , 1988 ; gott et al .",
    "1990 ; smoot et al . 1994 ; torres et al . 1995 ; colley et al . 1996 ; kogut et al .",
    "the genus , as will be discussed below , is equivalent to one of the three minkowski functionals for a two - dimensional map .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the set of statistics known as minkowski functionals ( minkowski 1903 ) . a general theorem of integral geometry states that all properties of a @xmath0-dimensional convex set ( or more generally",
    ", a finite union of convex sets ) which satisfy translational invariance and additivity ( called _ morphological _ properties ) are contained in @xmath1 numerical values ( hadwiger , 1956 and 1959 ) . for a pixelized temperature map @xmath2 ( or , e.g. , a density field ) , we consider the excursion sets of the map , defined as the set of all map pixels with value of @xmath3 greater than some threshold @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , weinberg et al .",
    "1987 ; melott 1990 ) .",
    "then the three functionals of these excursion sets completely describe the morphological properties of the underlying temperature map @xmath2 . in two and three dimensions ,",
    "the minkowski functionals have intuitive geometric interpretations .",
    "the key point relevant for this paper is that the minkowski functionals can be calculated exactly for an underlying gaussian field ( tomita 1990 ) .",
    "thus they provide a natural set of statistical tests for gaussianity .",
    "recently , buchert and collaborators have introduced minkowski functionals into the cosmological literature , primarily in the context of three - dimensional point distributions applied to galaxy surveys ( mecke et al .",
    "1994 ; buchert 1995 ; kerscher et al .",
    "1997 ) .    for a two - dimensional map , the three",
    "minkowski functionals correspond geometrically to the total fractional area of the excursion set , the boundary length of the excursion set per unit area , and the euler characteristic per unit area ( equivalent to the topological genus ) .",
    "the area ( coles 1988 , ryden et al . 1989 ) and the genus ( mentioned above ) have been previously considered in the context of microwave background temperature maps , but not in the unified formal context of the minkowski functionals .",
    "the additivity property , previously not exploited , allows an evaluation of the standard errors in estimating the functionals from a map , rather than resorting to monte carlo simulations as in previous work ( scaramella and vittorio 1991 ; torres et al .",
    "1995 ; kogut et al .",
    "a second property , given by the principle kinematic formulas , provides a recipe for incorporating arbitrary map boundaries in a straightforward way , a valuable advantage when analyzing upcoming maps with irregular portions of the sky cut out to eliminate contamination from foreground emission .",
    "this paper applies the formalism of minkowski functionals to pixelized two - dimensional maps as a test of gaussianity ; the results will be directly applicable to temperature maps of the microwave background . in sec .",
    "ii , we present an overview of minkowski functionals of continuous fields and explicate their relevant mathematical properties .",
    "section iii then considers the related case of minkowski functionals on a lattice , or equivalently of a pixelized map .",
    "we give explicit formulas for variances of the functionals and corrections for boundaries .",
    "we also give explicit calculational algorithms for different pixelization schemes .",
    "section iv addresses the issue of gaussianity , giving the explicit forms for the minkowski functionals for underlying gaussian statistical distributions .",
    "pixelization introduces corrections to the gaussian functionals in the smooth case , which we derive as power series in the pixel size .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v with a discussion of various issues related to analyzing maps , including noise , smoothness , and numerical efficiency .",
    "we are interested in characterizing the morphological properties of microwave background maps , the properties of the map which are invariant under translations and rotations and which are additive .",
    "for example , the area of the map which is above a certain temperature threshold is a morphological characteristic .",
    "the branch of mathematics known as integral geometry provides a natural tool for this characterization , known as the minkowski functionals ( or _ quermassintegrals _ ) . in this section",
    "we give a brief review of minkowski functionals and summarize their basic properties .",

    "we consider the excursion sets of the map , the map subset which exceeds a fixed threshold value . the threshold is treated as an independent variable on which the minkowski functionals of the excursion set depend .",

    "the following section discusses in detail how to construct a discrete version of these functionals , applicable to a pixelized map .",
    "the method of analysis proposed in this paper consists of comparing the values of the minkowski functionals @xmath48 calculated from an experimentally obtained map with the theoretical predictions for the expectation values and variances of @xmath48 on gaussian distributions . carrying out this program requires calculation of the minkowski functionals from given maps , properly taking into account the boundary of the observed region and the effect of pixelization .",
