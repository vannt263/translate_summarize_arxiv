    "one of the original aims of the microscopic bethe - brueckner - goldstone ( bbg ) theory of nuclear matter @xcite is to study the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter and reconcile the empirical saturation point .",
    "there are two most important uncertain points in the bbg theory @xcite .",
    "one is the choice of the auxiliary potential @xmath1 , another is relevance of the higher order contributions in the bbg expansion . over the last decades ,",
    "the many - body uncertainties in the bbg theory have been checked carefully , and considerable progress has been made for improving the predicted saturation point .    in an early stage of the bbg theory @xcite , the auxiliary potential @xmath1",
    "is introduced based on the re - summation of feynman diagrams @xcite , in order to decrease the number of diagrams in calculation @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that different choices for the self - consistent auxiliary potential have effect on the convergence rate of the hole - line expansion , and can produce energy shifts in the calculated total binding energy @xcite . as shown by day and wiringa @xcite , the three - hole line contribution in the bbg expansion is non - negligible in the gap choice of the auxiliary potential .",
    "baldo and song have extended the analysis to symmetry nuclear matter @xcite and pure neutron matter @xcite at the three - hole line level with the local separable argonne @xmath2 ( _ _ av__14 ) @xcite and argonne @xmath0 ( _ _ av__18 ) @xcite two - nucleon potentials by solving the bethe - fadeev equations @xcite .",
    "their results give a strong evidence that convergence has been reached @xcite within the gap and continuous choices for density up to six times the saturation value @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the results show that using the continuous choice leads to a faster convergence than the gap choice @xcite .",
    "since the eos of nuclear matter are obtained at the level of two - hole line , the results of ref.@xcite indicates that the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation under the continuous choice is able to incorporate large part of the three - hole correlations within the gap choice .",
    "although the convergence can be reached , the bhf approach is not able to reproduce the empirical saturation point by adopting purely two - body interactions in both the gap and the continuous choices @xcite .",
    "three - body forces ( tbf ) are required for describing reasonably the nuclear saturation properties @xcite . in recent years",
    ", calculations in the bhf approach have been updated by incorporating the consistent microscopic tbfs @xcite constructed consistently with the realistic bonn b @xcite and _ _ av__18 two - nucleon potentials as input .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the saturation points can be improved by including the tbfs from ( @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 mev ) to ( @xmath6 @xmath4 , @xmath7 mev ) and from ( @xmath8 @xmath4 , @xmath9 mev ) to ( @xmath10 @xmath4 , @xmath11 mev ) , for the bonn b and _ _",

    "we concentrate on the comparison between the tbf effects on the properties of nuclear matter obtained under the gap choice and the continuous choice .",
    "the symmetry energy within the two different choices for the self - consistent auxiliary potential is also investigated and discussed . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the bhf theory and the tbf model .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",

    "our calculations are based on the microscopic bhf approach .",
    "the bhf description of nuclear matter is derived by a linked cluster of independent hole - line expansion .",
    "the starting point of this theory is the in - medium two - body brueckner reaction matrix @xmath12 , which is the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , @xmath15 is the starting energy , and @xmath16 denotes nucleon number density .",

    "the convergence rate of the hole - line expansion depends on the specified choice of the auxiliary potential @xcite .",
    "two different choices have been usually adopted in the bhf calculations @xcite : one is the continuous choice , the other is the gap choice . under the continuous choice , the auxiliary potential is given by : @xmath19|kk'\\rangle_{a } \\label{eq : u}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath20 denotes antisymmetrization of the matrix elements .",
    "for the gap choice , the auxiliary potential for the hole states @xmath21 is calculated according to eq.([eq : u ] ) , while it is set to zero above the fermi surface @xmath22 .",
    "there are also other possibilities for choosing the auxiliary potential , e.g. the model - space bhf ( mbhf ) @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will restrict the calculations to the gap and continuous choices .",
    "for the realistic nn interaction , we adopt different realistic two - body interactions ( i.e. , the @xmath23 and the bonn b potentials  @xcite ) plus their corresponding microscopic tbfs which are base on the meson exchange current approach @xcite . in the obep approximation ,",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath16 , @xmath25 , @xmath15 mesons are considered and the corresponding meson parameters ( meson - nucleon couplings and form factors ) in the tbf model are determined self - consistently with the two - body potentials . in the present calculation , the tbf is reduced to an equivalently effective two - body force by averaging over the third nucleon degree of freedom in nuclear medium @xcite : @xmath26^{2}[1-g(r_{jk})]^{2}v_{ijk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the defect function which reflects the nn correlations in nuclear medium . within the bhf approximation ,",

    "we repeat those results simply for discussing the influence of the different choices for the auxiliary potential .",
    "one may notice that using the continuous choice tends to give binding energies about @xmath37 mev larger than the gap choice , since the continuous choice incorporates more non - negligible correlation effects in nuclear medium , which have been confirmed in refs .",

    "the repulsive contribution of the tbf increase rapidly as a function of density , which leads to a stiffer eos and less binding energies at the saturation point as compared with the results by using purely the two - body interactions , under both the gap and continuous choices .     [ fig3 ]    the saturation points extracted from the previous results",
    "are reported in fig .",
    "moreover , we give additional results with the _ _ av__14 potential in the same figure for the sake of comparison .",
