    "independent measurements by various groups have suggested that the recent expansion of the universe is speeding up and not slowing down , as believed for many decades @xcite . in other words , by virtue of some unknown mechanism , the cosmic expansion underwent a  dynamic phase transition \" whose main effect was to change the sign of the universal deceleration parameter @xmath2 at low redshifts .",
    "together with other complementary observations , such results are strongly indicating that we live in a flat , accelerating universe composed of @xmath3 1/3 of matter ( baryonic + dark ) and @xmath3 2/3 of an exotic component with large negative pressure , usually named dark energy ( see @xcite for some reviews ) .",
    "however , what seems more certain is that the universe was accelerating in a recent past , but that its current state of acceleration is less well determined @xcite .",
    "some authors , using a dynamical ansatz for the dark energy equation of state , have suggested that the cosmic acceleration has already peaked and that we are currently witnessing its slowing down @xcite .",
    "this behavior was also suggested by other works combining different methods and data @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a transient cosmic acceleration appears in several theoretical scenarios @xcite and is also theoretically interesting because eternally accelerating universes ( like @xmath1cdm ) are endowed with a cosmological event horizon which prevents the construction of a conventional s - matrix describing particle interactions .",
    "indeed , such a difficulty has been pointed out as a severe theoretical problem for any eternally accelerating universe @xcite . naturally , whether the acceleration of the universe is slowing down the overall dynamic behavior in the future may be profoundly different from the one predicted by the @xmath1cdm evolution .",
    "here we investigate the question related to a possible slowing down of the recent accelerating stage of the universe by using a distinct method . in order to access the present value of the deceleration parameter we consider the so - called cosmographic approach instead of assuming the validity of a specific gravitational theory together with a given dynamical dark energy model . as happens with kinematic models @xcite",
    ", the basic advantage of the cosmographic approach over dynamic models is that the former depends neither on the validity of general relativity nor on the matter - energy contents of the universe .",
    "in addition , to verify the dependence of the method on a particular set of supernova data , we repeat our analysis by considering three different samples , namely , the union @xcite , constitution @xcite , and union 2 @xcite compilations .",
    "following a traditional approach , the late time cosmic expansion can be expanded as @xcite @xmath4 , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the present day values of the hubble , deceleration , jerk and snap parameters , respectively .",
    "similarly , the luminosity distance can also be expanded , yielding an extended version of the hubble law @xmath9 + { \\cal o}(z^5 ) ,      \\label{dl_exp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it was assumed a flat universe , as is done throughout this work .",
    "as it appears , the truncation of the above expression is endowed with some convergence issues @xcite , which is a source of concern since the sn ia samples do have events at @xmath10 .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem of convergence at high redshift is to limit the supernova sample to events of lower redshift .",
    "another approach is to parametrize cosmological distances by the so - called _ y - redshift _",
    "@xcite , defined by @xmath11 , a quantity related to the usual redshift , @xmath12 , by @xmath13    using the _ y - redshift _ we can expand the luminosity distance as @xmath14 + { \\cal o}(y^5 ) .      \\label{dly_exp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this parametrization has the nice property that its convergence radius comprises the full range of past cosmological events .    in what follows , in order to fit the sn ia data compiled by the union ( 307 events ) , constitution ( 397 events ) and union 2 ( 557 events ) samples , we consider ( i ) the fourth order expansion of the luminosity distance in redshift , which we will label @xmath15 , that is , the truncation of ( [ dl_exp ] ) , and ( ii ) the fourth order expansion of the luminosity distance in _ y - redshift _ , @xmath16 , the truncation of ( [ dly_exp ] ) . for the redshift",
    "expansion fit we use sub - samples with @xmath17 , labeling the expansions @xmath18 , which for @xmath19 yields 157 events ( 51% ) for the union , 247 events ( 62% ) for the constitution , and 402 events ( 72% ) for the union 2 compilation .",
    "we construct the likelihood as @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 ^ 2}{\\sigma_\\mu^2(i)},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 runs through the sn ia events , @xmath23 + 25 $ ] is the predicted distance modulus in a given model , and @xmath24 is the total uncertainty on the distance moduli . in the likelihood analysis we analytically marginalize over @xcite the nuisance parameter containing the hubble parameter ( @xmath5 ) and the supernova absolute magnitude ( @xmath25 ) , and",
    "numerically maximize for two remaining nuisance parameters related to the supernova light curve fitting ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "for both the union and constitution sets the salt method values for @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( stretch ) and @xmath30 ( color ) were used : @xmath31 .",
    "union 2 uses salt2 light curve fitting : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a free parameter that measures the deviation from the average decline rate .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the value of the deceleration parameter today , we show in figure [ q0_likel ] the marginal likelihoods for @xmath6 ( marginalization over @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "both cosmographic parametrizations , @xmath34 here is meant to be conservative in terms of possible convergence problems in the @xmath15 expansion . ] and @xmath16 , are statistically compatible and have similar dispersion , even though the @xmath35 implies a considerably smaller number of events in the @xmath34 analysis in relation to the full sn ia sets used in the @xmath16 analysis . this effect was already noticed before @xcite , and that may be indicating that the _ y - redshift _ expansion is not optimal to maximize the fisher information .",
    "marginal likelihood for the deceleration parameter today .",
    "top panel uses the union sn ia compilation , central panel uses the constitution , and the lower panel uses the union 2 . in the upper left corner of each panel is indicated the number of events in each data set .",
    "curves are scaled to @xmath36=1 $ ] . ]",
    "the basic distinction feature between the union and constitution sets comes from 90 events at low redshift ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "they have the effect of shifting the @xmath6 likelihoods to higher values ( figure [ q0_likel ] ) , thereby increasing the probability of a decelerating universe ( table [ table ] ) .",
    "the union 2 has an even higher percentage of low redshift events and the deceleration likelihood derived from @xmath34 is further shifted to higher values of @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the low-@xmath37 sn ia events are pointing to a higher @xmath6 than the full sample .",
    "such a trend could help to explain why shafieloo et al .",
    "@xcite found a slowing down of the cosmic acceleration when analyzing the constitution data set , but probably would find ( i ) a weaker result had they used the first union compilation and ( ii ) maybe an even stronger result had they used the union 2 .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table ]    to further explore the suggestion that low-@xmath37 sn ia events may be pointing to higher @xmath6 values , we examine the union 2 data set up to various redshift cuts , @xmath39 , with the @xmath18 parametrization .",
    "this point of view is reinforced by the results shown in figure [ q0_zcut ] and table [ table ] .",
    "the more recent the sn ia events are , the higher is the peak and average deceleration values today and the larger is the probability for positive @xmath6 .",
    "note that the higher deceleration probability with lower redshift cutoff is due not only to a higher peak and average deceleration parameter , but also to a higher variance in the distribution , consequence of looser constraining of the parameter space .",
    "the use of various redshift cuts in the @xmath16 parametrization also corroborates those findings ( numerical results not shown ) .",
    "probability distribution function for the deceleration parameter today for the @xmath18 parametrization .",
    "the internal legend shows the cut redshift and the corresponding number of sn ia from the union 2 compilation . ]    in table [ table ] , by using @xmath18 and @xmath16 , we quantify the probability for the universe to be slowing down today for the three sn ia samples .",
    "it has been estimated by computing the integrated marginal likelihood for @xmath0 @xmath40 when just @xmath35 events are fitted , then the constitution and union 2 sets indicate a considerable probability of a slowing down universe .",
    "this probability is also large ( and even dominant in the constitution case ) when the samples are fitted by @xmath16 . using a fifth order expansion",
    ", john also found a significant probability of a positive @xmath6 .",
    "it is not totally surprising that both parametrizations , @xmath18 and @xmath16 , lead to distributions for @xmath6 that are not identical .",
    "previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) showed that best - fit values are model ( parametrization ) dependent , even for models with same goodness of fit .",
    "because the @xmath34 and @xmath16 fits yield broad marginal likelihoods that are nearly symmetrical and peaked around @xmath41 , most notably with the constitution and union 2 compilations , @xmath38 is very sensitive to the point of maximum likelihood , which is not a robust feature of those fits in relation to the various data sets .",
    "this explains the variability of the results shown in table [ table ] in relation to the different sn ia sets .    as a byproduct",
    ", we also obtain the marginal likelihood distributions for the jerk and snap parameters today ( figure [ j0_s0__likel ] ) from the union 2 data .",
    "the @xmath34 parametrization yields somewhat tighter constrains than @xmath16 , even though it uses less events .",
    "our results for the _ y - redshift _ parametrization are also in general agreement with what @xcite found using the first union data set . for reference",
    ", the flat @xmath1cdm model has @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore this model has a single free parameter , which the best fit to the union 2 data gives @xmath45 .",
    "marginal likelihood for the jerk and snap parameters today from the union 2 data . ]",
    "independently of the cosmic deceleration today , it is of interest to know if there is another change in the sign of the cosmic acceleration after a prior transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase at moderate redshifts ( @xmath46 ) . from the power series expansion of the scale factor ( [ a_exp ] )",
    "one can also express the deceleration parameter as a power series in time .",
    "this time variable can be written as a power series in redshift or _ y - redshift _ , yielding respectively @xmath47 and @xmath48 equivalently , if the truncation of ( [ a_exp ] ) is made at third order , then the resulting expression for @xmath2 and @xmath49 is linear .",
    "several works @xcite were based on the @xmath50 parametrization for the deceleration , which does not allow a transient cosmic acceleration .",
    "the derivation of a power expansion for the deceleration from the scale factor expansion establishes a natural link with the kinematic studies based on a @xmath2 expansion in power series .",
    "j. v. cunha ( private communication ) employed the @xmath51 parametrization and found a suggestion of transient acceleration ( see @xcite for another formulation of a quadratic kinematic model ) .",
    "the quadratic form of ( [ q_quadr ] ) and ( [ qy_quadr ] ) allows for a decelerated past , a transition to an accelerated phase , a point of maximum acceleration , then a slowing down of the acceleration and a transition to a recent or future decelerating phase . similar behavior of transient acceleration is predicted or allowed by several dynamic models @xcite . in contrast , the @xmath1cdm model predicts a monotonic deceleration history connecting its asymptotic limits in the past and future , @xmath52 and @xmath53",

    "we use the cosmographic parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) obtained in each parametrization with the union 2 sample to reconstruct @xmath2 using ( [ qy_quadr ] ) and ( [ yz ] ) , which is shown in figure [ qxz ] .",
    "the confidence regions shown in the figure are drawn from all @xmath2 curves allowed by the parameter values such that @xmath60 is less than a threshold @xcite .",
    "the top panel shows the deceleration reconstruction for the @xmath18 parametrization for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the first constrains very loosely @xmath2 , not even showing a phase of accelerated cosmic expansion with confidence above 1@xmath54 .",
    "the higher cut redshift allows a tighter constraining , being maximum for @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath2 reconstruction obtained from the @xmath16 parametrization is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ qxz ] .",
    "it defines a clear phase of accelerated expansion around @xmath64 , but suggests it is slowing down around @xmath63 , where the @xmath2 reconstruction is maximally constrained .    for comparison , figure [ qxz ]",
    "also plots the results for a flat @xmath1cdm model , showing that under this parametrization all redshifts have equally well determined deceleration . as we know that the sn ia data is limited to a redshift range , it is clear that the preponderant factor in this @xmath1cdm result is the model itself , not the data .",
    "we also note that , even though the comparison of the cosmographic parametrizations with the @xmath1cdm model is not the objective of this work , all have very similar goodness of fit as measured by the reduced @xmath65 .",
    "all cosmographic parametrizations contain transient acceleration solutions in their 1@xmath54 confidence regions with a considerable positive deceleration probability today and in the near future , if we assume that the cosmographic parametrization has some predictive power .",
    "however , due to the large uncertainties in the @xmath2 reconstructions at large redshifts or in a projection into the future ( @xmath66 ) from the cosmographic parametrizations of the union 2 data alone , it is not possible to affirm if there is a transition from a phase of accelerated expansion to a present or future phase of deceleration .",
    "an improvement in the containment of the allowed @xmath2 could be achieved by imposing external conditions to the cosmographic analysis , for example that in the remote past the matter dominated universe should be decelerated . as an exploratory investigation",
    ", we implement this external restriction to the analysis in the bottom panel of figure [ qxz ] by imposing that @xmath67 is arbitrary , but meant to be a conservative compromise .",
    "a larger redshift would imply a lower constraint on the fitting , and a with a smaller redshift , the constraint would be stronger , but then we would be less certain about the reality of the @xmath68 condition .",
    "] at the 1@xmath54 confidence level . as a result ,",
    "the allowed @xmath2 is further constrained , only leaving transient acceleration solutions .",
    "the strict transient behavior obtained with the external @xmath67 condition may be a consequence of the fourth order cosmographic parametrization for the luminosity distance , as this implies a quadratic @xmath2 which may be forced to have two zeros ( two transition redshifts ) .",
    "every parametrization implies a bias , and to test if this is the case for the transient solutions in the approach adopted , one would need to go to higher order in the cosmographic expansion .",
    "however , models with a higher number of parameters would need more data to meaningfully constrain the parameter space .",
    "to address the main question of this work , we should focus on the results for the union 2 compilation , since it is currently the largest and most updated .",
    "both kinds of cosmographic parametrization , @xmath18 and @xmath16 , allow the circumvention of convergence issues related to the power expansion , broadly agree and ( i ) suggest that lower redshift sn events point to lower cosmic acceleration , and ( ii ) indicate that there is a considerable probability for the universe to be decelerating today .",
    "the slowing down of the cosmic acceleration and even a transient acceleration scenario is allowed in all cosmographic parametrizations .",
    "the possibility that those results may be due to bias induced by the form of the parametrizations and data analysis artifacts may be examined inside the cosmographic approach by going to higher order in the scale factor expansion and through the use of simulated data inside some conveniently chosen fiducial cosmological models . that in itself would constitute an interesting follow up study that could be useful to improve the understanding of the limitations of the observational data sets and of the analysis methods .",
    "what may be causing a possible slowing down of cosmic acceleration and transient can not be answered with basis only in a cosmographic approach .",
    "we recall that in the accepted scenario ( inflation followed by radiation , dark matter and dark energy dominated stages ) , the universe already had two accelerating stages and what is being discussed is whether the present supernova data are compatible with a new transition to a decelerating phase . some examples of dynamical scenarios discussed in the literature include quintessence models in which the equation of state parameter becomes positive in the future , and some d - branes inspired scenarios , among others @xcite . naturally , we can not exclude the possibility that such a slowing down might be provoked by some exotic kinematic ( or dynamic effect ) in the presence of inhomogeneities @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we used fourth order expansions of the luminosity distance to describe the recent cosmic expansion as probed by sn ia observations .",
    "we showed that one needs to go at least to fourth order in the expansion of the luminosity distance to be able to describe a transient acceleration .",
    "other works @xcite , using smaller data sets than some of those used here , indicate that going to higher orders does not add meaningful statistical information . under a cosmographic analysis of the most recent sn ia compilations ,",
    "we have found a suggestion of cosmic acceleration slowing down and the existence of a considerable probability in the relevant parameter space that the universe is already in a decelerating expansion regime .",
    "this result is in great contrast to the standard @xmath1cdm model , which predicts that the cosmic expansion is accelerating and must remain so forever with an ever increasing acceleration .",
    "the predictability of the cosmographic parametrizations are considerably inferior to the @xmath1cdm model and other dynamical models , but that seems to be the price for avoiding the usual assumptions about the physical contents of the universe and the underlying gravity theory .",
    "it should also be stressed that the price for avoiding convergence issues for the expansion in powers of @xmath37 has severe consequences on model predictability , but this could be overcome by a much larger sn ia sample ( which is foreseen in future surveys ) , by the use of other kinds of data and priors , and maybe by a smarter ( optimal ) cosmographic modeling .",
