    "heavy - ion fusion reactions are sensitive probes of the nuclear surface of the reacting nuclei . roughly speaking ,",
    "the height of the coulomb barrier is determined by the radii and diffuseness of the densities , and the enhancement of fusion at subbarrier energies is governed by couplings to the excitation of low - lying surface modes @xcite .",
    "this picture may not always succeed in reproducing the measured cross sections . in practical coupled - channels calculations",
    "it is often necessary to make adjustments , either in the structure input or in the ion - ion potential .",
    "the adjustments may reflect the influence of high - lying states or other reaction channels that are not treated explicitly in the calculations .",
    "another complication is the hindrance of fusion which occurs at low energies and very small cross sections @xcite .",
    "the hindrance can be explained , for example , by using a shallow potential in entrance channel @xcite or by modeling the fusion dynamics for touching and overlapping nuclei @xcite .    in this work",
    "the coupled - channels technique is applied to analyze the fusion data for @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca that were recently measured down to very small cross sections below 1 @xmath4b @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the data provides the opportunity to investigate whether the fusion hindrance , which is a well established phenomenon in extreme subbarrier fusion reactions of medium - heavy systems with large negative q - values @xcite , also occurs in the fusion of calcium isotopes with near zero q - values .",
    "an indication of a hindrance in the fusion of @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca has already been observed @xcite because the low - energy data could only be reproduced by coupled - channels calculations that employ a very large diffuseness of the ion - ion potential .",
    "however , the hindrance observed there was not strong enough to show an @xmath5 factor maximum in the energy region of the measurement .",
    "the ion - ion potential and the nuclear couplings that will be used are derived as in previous work @xcite from the double - folding of the densities of the reacting nuclei and the m3y+repulsion effective interaction .",
    "since the low - lying structure of @xmath0ca is fairly well established and the influence of transfer reactions is always suppressed for symmetric systems , it is expected that the simple picture of fusion described above would apply to the fusion of @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the excitation and/or polarization of high - lying states that are included explicitly in the coupled - channels calculations can lead to a negative energy shift of the calculated fusion cross sections @xcite .",
    "this is effectively equivalent to increasing the radii of the reacting nuclei .",
    "the radius that is extracted by optimizing the fit to the fusion data can therefore be too large because it can be contaminated by the polarization of states which are not included explicitly in the calculations .",
    "it is of interest to see how the extracted radius depends on the model space of excited states that are included in the calculations , and how well it compares to the expected matter radius of @xmath0ca .",
    "the study of the fusion of different calcium isotopes started more than twenty years ago with the measurements by aljuwair et al .",
    "@xcite but the cross sections were only measured down to about 1 mb .",
    "the most challenging theoretical issue at that time was to explain the fusion of @xmath6ca+@xmath0ca which appeared to be strongly enhanced by couplings to transfer reactions , in particular to those with positive q values @xcite .",
    "a strong motivation for reviving the study of the fusion of calcium isotopes is that , in addition to @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca @xcite , the fusion of @xmath6ca+@xmath0ca has also recently been measured down to the 1 @xmath4b @xcite , and a new measurement for @xmath6ca+@xmath6ca is underway @xcite . in order to be able to focus on and isolate the effect of transfer on the fusion of the asymmetric @xmath6ca+@xmath0c system , it is necessary first to develop a good description of the fusion of the two symmetric systems , and",

    "it should be noted that the coulomb and nuclear coupling strengths , expressed in table [ structure ] by the values of @xmath8 , are different .",

    "the adopted @xmath12-values @xcite shown in the third column of the second part of table [ structure ] can be combined into an effective two - phonon excitation .",
    "for example , the effective @xmath12 value for the two- to one - phonon transition is given by the sum , @xmath13 and the two - phonon excitation energy is obtained as the weighted average of the individual two - phonon excitations energies @xcite .",
    "the parameters obtained for the effective two - phonon quadrupole excitation are shown in the last line of table [ structure ] . including the effective two - phonon quadrupole excitations in the coupled - channels calculations , in addition to the 7 channels mentioned above ,",

    "the m3y+repulsion potential is calculated using the double - folding technique described in ref .",
    "it is based on the reid parametrization of the m3y effective nucleon - nulceon interaction @xcite .",
    "the spherical nuclear densities are parametrized by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath22 are the radius and diffuseness parameters , respectively , and @xmath29 is a normalization constant .",

    "( [ rho ] ) is that the mean - square radius is given by the simple expression @xmath35    the repulsive part of the m3y+repulsion potential is determined by two parameters , namely , the strength @xmath36 of the contact effective interaction , @xmath37 that generates it , and the diffuseness @xmath38 of the densities that are applied in the double - folding calculation @xcite .",
    "the radius parameter @xmath28 of the densities , on the other hand , is kept the same as in the calculation of the direct and the exchange parts of the m3y double - folding potential .",
    "the diffuseness of the density that is used in calculating the direct and the exchange part of the m3y potential is kept fixed with the value @xmath22 = 0.54 fm .",
    "the two parameters @xmath38 and @xmath36 of the repulsive part of the potential are constrained so that total nuclear potential energy , @xmath39 , for completely overlapping nuclei is consistent with the equation - of - state .",

    "it is unrealistic because it is deeper than the ground state energy of the compound nucleus @xmath45zr which is indicated by the thick horizontal line .",

    "the ratio drops quickly at energies below 50 mev .",
    "this is attributed to the fusion hindrance phenomenon .",
    "in fact , the steep falloff with decreasing energy observed in the comparison to standard coupled - channels calculations was the signature that was first used to identify the fusion hindrance @xcite .",
    "later it was shown that the hindrance is often so strong that the @xmath5 factor for fusion develops a maximum at very low energies .",
    "moreover , it was realized that an @xmath5 factor maximum together with the energy @xmath49 of the maximum is a good quantitative way to characterize the fusion hindrance phenomenon @xcite .",

    "in fact , the @xmath5 factor for the fusion of @xmath64s+@xmath0ca increases slowly and linearly in a logarithmic plot with decreasing energy ( see fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "another interesting point is that the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ 4848f1d ] exhibits a maximum near 48 mev before it rises steeply below 44 mev .",
    "it intersects with the constant @xmath5 factor limit at @xmath61 = 43.2 mev , where the associated @xmath5 factor in fig .",
    "[ m3y4848sf ] develops a maximum .",
    "the fusion data for @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca have been analyzed using the coupled - channels technique and different ion - ion potentials .",
    "the analysis based on a standard woods - saxon potential clearly showed that the data are strongly hindered at low energies . by employing and adjusting the m3y+repulsion double - folding potential it was possible to achieve an excellent description of the data .",
    "the best fit to the data was achieved with a nuclear radius of @xmath0ca that is slightly larger than but still consistent with the matter radius of @xmath0ca .",
    "the latter radius was determined from the measured rms charge radius and the rms neutron radius extracted from an analysis of elastic proton scattering data .",
    "the fact that the extracted radius is slightly larger than the matter radius may be caused by the polarization of high - lying states that are not included in the coupled - channels calculations .",
    "the entrance channel potential for the best fit to the data has a rather shallow pocket , consistent with the findings of previous analyses of fusion data for medium - heavy systems .",
    "the m3y+repulsion potential model is therefore also referred to as the shallow potential model , in contrast to models based on the standard woods - saxon potentials , which have relatively deep pockets in the entrance channel potential .",
    "the @xmath5 factor for the fusion of @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca does not show a maximum within the energy range of the experiment .",
    "however , it is predicted to develop a maximum at a 3 mev lower energy which is nearly the same as the energy value obtained from the extrapolation method in ref .",
    "the cross section associated with the maximum @xmath5 factor is very small ( @xmath65 0.3 nb ) and is a serious challenge to the experimental technology .",
