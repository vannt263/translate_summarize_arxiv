    "the group iv materials are attractive and promising candidates for the achievement of spintronic devices.@xcite the dyakonov - perel mechanism is absent in these materials due to the centrosymmetry and the hyperfine interaction can be suppressed by isotopic purification , which ensures a relative long spin - decoherence time.@xcite also , the silicon - based microfabrication technology is well - developed and extensively used.@xcite germanium ( ge ) , as a group iv element adjacent to silicon , shares the good spin - decoherent property and is fully compatible with the existing mature nanoelectronic technology in silicon ( si).@xcite particularly , in contrast to si , ge shows obvious electro - optic effect as its direct gap ( at the @xmath1 point ) is close to the indirect gap ( at the @xmath0 point ) and lies in the infrared range.@xcite thus the optical orientation of carriers , which is free from the interfacial effect and the external electric and magnetic fields , can be carried out effectively in ge - based devices.@xcite moreover , compared with si , the longer spin - diffusion length stemming from the larger carrier mobility is helpful to the spin injection and the relative strong spin - orbit coupling benefits the manipulation of spin.@xcite    in recent years , ge attracts a renewed interest both experimentally and theoretically . in the experimental side , loren _",
    "et al._@xcite and pezzoli _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated the optical injection and detection of polarized electrons and holes in bulk ge and ge - based quantum wells , where electrons are pumped optically in the @xmath1 valley and quickly scattered to the indirect valleys . in the theoretical side ,",
    "a progress was made in investigations of the conduction band structure and spin - dependent electron - phonon scattering.@xcite a compact 10@xmath710 @xmath3 hamiltonian was constructed around the @xmath0 point via the method of invariant.@xcite moreover , tang _",
    "et al._@xcite derived the selection rules for intra- and inter-@xmath0 valley electron - phonon scattering , and calculated the average absolute values of corresponding scattering elements within the tight - binding model . later",
    "_ et al._@xcite demonstrated the scattering matrices for the inter-@xmath0 valley scattering and acoustic ( ac ) contribution to the intra-@xmath0 valley scattering by using the pseudo - potential method , where the approximated wave - vector dependence of the intra-@xmath0 valley scattering is derived with the combination of @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 , pseudo - potential and group theories.@xcite very recently li _",
    "et al._@xcite also reported the selection rules of the intra@xmath1-@xmath0 valley electron - phonon scattering in the calculation of phonon - assisted optical transitions in ge .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the complete scattering matrices of several important channels of the electron - phonon scattering have not been discussed yet , such as the intra-@xmath1 valley scattering , the optical - phonon ( op ) contribution to the intra-@xmath0 scattering as well as the inter@xmath1-@xmath8 valley scattering .",
    "as shown in previous works , these scatterings are fundamental to understand the spin dynamics in the optical orientation of electron spin in ge.@xcite    in this work , we readdress the band structure of ge near the conduction band minima and study the phonon - induced electron scatterings in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys .",
    "we first derive a spin - dependent 16@xmath716 @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 hamiltonian in the vicinity of the @xmath0 point in ge from the band basis functions at this point.@xcite compared with ref .",
    "where the effective electron masses are taken as granted , here we start from the free electron mass and straightforwardly obtain the renormalization of masses from this hamiltonian .",
    "it can fit the band structure of the lowest three conduction bands and highest two valence bands , and provides the eigenstates for quantitative demonstration of conduction electron spin properties .",
    "till now , in addition to the well - known subgroup technique which gives the selection rules of the wave - vector - independent contribution to the electron - phonon interaction,@xcite two approaches for deriving the explicit wave - vector dependence of scattering matrix have been brought forward.@xcite in one approach the initial and final electronic states are expressed as the @xmath3 eigenstates .",
    "the wave - vector dependence of scattering matrix element is the product of that in the electron / phonon states and crystal potential.@xcite here the selection rule for each analytical term is given by the group - theory analysis from the symmetries of the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 basis functions , phonon state and crystal potential , while the coefficients of the electron - phonon scattering matrices are integrals involving the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 basis functions and crystal potential and can be calculated straightforwardly via the pseudo - potential method .",
    "the other approach , i.e. , the theory of invariants , utilizes the invariance of electron - phonon interaction to the symmetry operators in the corresponding space group.@xcite the invariant scattering matrix consists of products of wave - vector - dependent irreducible tensor components and the bare spin - dependent matrices and takes into account the symmetry of phonon states .",
    "the corresponding coefficients should be obtained via calculation with numerical techniques such as pseudo - potential or tight - binding methods.@xcite obviously , the validity of the first approach is sensitive to the choice of @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 eigenstates , and the second one is not limited by the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 hamiltonian",
    ". therefore we take the invariant method , and determine the coefficients via fitting with our pseudo - potential calculations .    by applying the method of invariants",
    ", we construct the scattering matrices and investigate the intra- and inter - valley scatterings involving both the @xmath1 and four @xmath0 valleys .",
    "the matrix elements for the intra-@xmath1 and inter@xmath1-@xmath0 valley scattering , the op contribution and separated transverse acoustic ( ta ) and longitudinal acoustic ( la ) contributions to the intra-@xmath0 valley electron - phonon scattering are provided for the first time . for each phonon mode",
    ", we demonstrate the lowest - order wave - vector dependence of the scattering matrix as it is much larger than the higher - order terms .",
    "it should be noted that the zeroth - order contribution to the spin - flip scattering elements does exist in the inter - valley scattering but vanishes in the intra - valley case .",
    "furthermore , with our @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 hamiltonian at the @xmath0 point and a @xmath9 @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 hamiltonian at the @xmath1 point , we analyze the elliott@xcite and yafet@xcite mechanisms in these electron - phonon scatterings.@xcite in all the cases above , our calculations with pseudo - potential method confirm our selection rules and analytical wave - vector dependence of scattering matrices .",
