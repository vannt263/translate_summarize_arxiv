    "the nucleus coulomb interaction method is an effective approach to study in high - energy experiments the low - energy electromagnetic properties of pions in the process @xmath4 .",
    "there are two possible ways to realize the coulomb interaction method in experiment : the radiative scattering @xmath5 of a pion on a nucleus and the photoproduction of pion pairs in the coulomb field of a nucleus @xmath6 .",
    "the experiments under discussion are based on the fact that for sufficiently small momentum transfers the interaction of high - energy particle with nuclei is extremely peripheral and thus dominated by scattering on the virtual photons of the coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "the reaction @xmath5 allows to investigate the @xmath4 process in the region @xmath7 and to measure the charged pion polarizability @xcite at the point @xmath8 , while the reaction @xmath6 occurs in the region @xmath9 close to threshold . in the case of charged pions",
    "the two reactions give complementary information about the process @xmath10 in both the physical and the non - physical region . in the case of neutral pions",
    "the photoproduction of a neutral pion pair in the coulomb field of a nucleus provides a new source of the information on the process @xmath11 , which was measured in the electron - positron experiment by the crystal ball collaboration @xcite and is under active discussion in the context of the physical programme at da@xmath12ne @xcite .",
    "the present theoretical interest in the elementary process @xmath11 is caused both by experimental data @xcite mentioned above and recent progress in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite up to and including @xmath2 .",
    "the process @xmath11 is very sensitive to the higher - order contributions in chpt since the first non - vanishing amplitude arises from meson loops at @xmath13 without counterterms .",
    "however , the one - loop amplitude at @xmath13 calculated in paper @xcite does not describe the data even near threshold @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , as the analysis of the @xmath11 amplitude based on dispersion relations @xcite demonstrates the importance of unitarity corrections corresponding to higher orders , next to @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the two - loop calculation at @xmath2 carried out in paper @xcite gives a considerable improvement of the description within chpt .",
    "for completeness we mention that there is also another consideration of @xmath11 up to one - loop order corresponding to @xmath14 in the treatment of generalized chpt @xcite .    the contribution from the @xmath2 counterterms",
    "was estimated in paper @xcite up to @xmath2 . ] from the low - energy meson phenomenology with resonance exchange saturation . in papers",
    "@xcite the counterterms were fixed as effective meson lagrangians with higher - order derivative terms obtained from the bosonization of nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath11 to higher - order corrections including born contributions from the effective meson lagrangian at @xmath2 makes this process a valuable source of the experimental information essential for the test of bosonized chiral lagrangians at @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of studying the process @xmath11 near threshold in the photoproduction of neutral pion pairs in the coulomb field of a nucleus .",
    "for the first time the reaction @xmath6 was considered in this context in paper @xcite with a one - loop amplitude of @xmath11 at @xmath13 .",
    "the total cross sections @xmath6 were estimated for energies of the incident photon at 20 gev and 40  gev for momentum transfer cutoffs 5 mev and 10  mev , respectively .",
    "however , due to the large incident energy and small cutoff , the nuclear absorption and the offshellness of the virtual photon from the nuclear coulomb field were not taken into account .    in this note , we extend and improve the previous calculation @xcite in a consistent way : we presents results of a calculation of the nuclear coulomb photoproduction of neutral pion pairs , where we include in the elementary amplitude @xmath15 both off - shell corrections for the coulomb virtual photon @xmath16 and contributions from chpt up to @xmath2 , and where , in addition , nuclear structure and absorption are taken into account in the form factor for the nucleus .",

    "this drastic assumption is mediated by the correction term @xmath58 , which arises from the integration over the three - dimensional cylinder behind the nucleus and corresponds to the interaction of photons with the nuclear coulomb field after passing through the nucleus .    in general ,",
    "the integrations above can be done only numerically . however , when both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are small compared to unity , the correction @xmath58 can conveniently be expanded to obtain @xmath61\\bigg (      -\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{\\i}{8}q_lr+\\frac{1}{120}(q_tr)^2 \\\\ \\fl & &      + \\frac{4-\\i 15\\pi}{480}(q_lr)^2+\\i\\frac{5}{144}(q_lr)^3      -\\frac{\\i}{96}q_lr(q_tr)^2 \\bigg)+ ... \\bigg\\ } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
