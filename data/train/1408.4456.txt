    "in july 2012 the higgs boson , the last missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) , was discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern @xcite . since then the hierarchy problem ,",
    "i.e.  the question about the mechanism that stabilizes the higgs mass near the electroweak scale , is no longer a hypothetical issue . a promising possibility to solve the hierarchy problem is offered by randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite , in which the sm is embedded in a slice of anti - de sitter space while the higgs sector is localized on the `` infra - red ( ir ) brane '' , one of two sub - manifolds bounding the extra dimension .",
    "the smallness of the electroweak scale can then be explained by the fundamental uv cutoff given by the warped planck scale , whose value near the ir brane lies in the tev range .",
    "moreover , by allowing the fermion fields to propagate in the bulk , these models provide a natural explanation for the hierarchies observed in the flavor sector @xcite and the smallness of flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "the direct detection of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes , massive copies of the sm particles with approximately equidistant mass gaps , would be a clear indication for a warped extra dimension .",
    "unfortunately , none of these predicted particles have been observed yet , and electroweak precision measurements indicate that their masses could be too large for direct detection at the lhc . thus , indirect searches like precision measurements of the higgs - boson couplings to sm particles , which are accessible via studies of both the higgs production cross sections and its various decay rates , become an attractive alternative . in the context of higgs physics ,",
    "new - physics deviations from the sm can be searched for by measuring the signal rates @xmath4 for the production of the higgs boson in @xmath5 collisions at the lhc and its subsequent inclusive decay into an arbitrary final state @xmath6 .",
    "our work includes a detailed discussion of the signal rates @xmath7 for the most relevant decays into @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in different incarnations of rs models . from   we can read off",
    "that new physics can show up in three different ways .",
    "firstly , it can lead to deviations in the higgs production cross section @xmath10 , which can be decomposed into the cross sections for higgs production via gluon fusion , vector - boson fusion , higgs - strahlung , and the associated production with a @xmath11 pair .",
    "the relative contributions read ( for @xmath12gev ) @xcite @xmath13 secondly , new - physics effects can change the higgs decay rates @xmath14 , and thirdly they can modify the total higgs width @xmath15 . via the latter quantity the rates are sensitive to non - standard or invisible higgs decays . in our analysis",
    "we take into account all three possibilities .",
    "while the gluon - fusion process has been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite , we analyze the effects of the exchange of virtual kk resonances in the higgs - strahlung and vector - boson fusion production processes for the first time .",
    "moreover , we take a closer look at the higgs decays into pairs of @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons , including their subsequent decays into leptons .",
    "this allows for a thorough discussion of the implications of the latest lhc results on the rs parameter space .    in the context of various rs models , we summarize and discuss results for the various couplings of the higgs boson to fermions and gauge bosons as well as the higgs self - couplings .",
    "it has been reported in @xcite that the lhc at @xmath18tev and with an integrated luminosity of 300fb@xmath19 has the potential to probe , in a model - independent way , deviations of the higgs couplings to fermions in the range of @xmath20 and to gauge bosons in the range of @xmath21 , both at 95% confidence level ( cl ) . at future lepton colliders like the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    "@xcite , the sensitivity to deviations can be improved by almost one order of magnitude ( assuming @xmath22tev and an integrated luminosity of 1000fb@xmath19 ) . in order to explore to",
    "which extent it is possible to obtain evidence for models with warped extra dimensions by indirect measurements , we illustrate which regions of parameter space could be probed at these facilities .",
    "we focus on rs models where the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector is localized on or near the ir brane .",
    "the extra dimension is chosen to be an @xmath23 orbifold parametrized by a coordinate @xmath24 $ ] , with two 3-branes localized on the orbifold fixed - points @xmath25 ( uv brane ) and @xmath26 ( ir brane ) .",
    "the rs metric reads @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , is referred to as the warp factor .",
    "the size @xmath30 and curvature @xmath31 of the extra dimension are assumed to be of planck size , @xmath32 . the quantity @xmath33 measures the size of the extra dimension and is chosen to be @xmath34 in order to explain the hierarchy between the planck scale @xmath35 and the tev scale .",
    "we define the kk scale @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , which sets the mass scale for the low - lying kk excitations of the sm particles . on the right - hand side of",
    "we have introduced a new coordinate @xmath38 , whose values on the uv and ir branes are @xmath39 and 1 , respectively .",
    "is related to the conformal coordinate @xmath40 frequently used in the literature by the simple rescaling @xmath41 . ] in our analysis , we consider both the minimal and the custodially protected rs model , adopting the conventions and notations of @xcite . in the minimal rs model",
    "the gauge group is taken to be @xmath42 like in the sm , and it is broken to @xmath43 by the higgs vacuum expectation model ( vev ) . the rs model with custodial symmetry",
    "is based on the gauge group @xmath44 , which is broken both on the uv and ir branes as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the discrete @xmath45 symmetry sets the gauge couplings of the two @xmath46 symmetries equal to each other .",
    "we shall distinguish two scenarios of rs models , which differ in the localization of the higgs sector . in models with a _ brane - localized higgs field _ , the inverse characteristic width of the higgs field along the extra dimension @xmath47 is assumed to be much larger than the inherent uv cutoff near the ir brane , i.e.  @xmath48 @xcite . in models in which the higgs field lives in the bulk",
    ", the inverse width lies below the cutoff scale , and hence the structure of the higgs profile can be resolved by the high - momentum modes of the theory . while the general bulk - higgs case will be discussed in future work @xcite , we only discuss the special case of models featuring a _ narrow bulk - higgs field _ ,",
    "whose inverse width is such that @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : treeh ] we calculate the cross sections for higgs production via higgs - strahlung and vector - boson fusion , as well as the decay rates of the higgs boson into pairs of electroweak gauge bosons . in section  [ sec : coupsa ] we give a summary of the main higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons in rs models , including the loop - induced couplings to two gluons and photons , and present expressions that are exact at first order in @xmath50 .",
    "a numerical study of both the cp - even and cp - odd higgs couplings in the custodial rs model is performed in section  [ sec : coupsn ] .",
    "we comment on the possibility to detect deviations from the sm values of the higgs couplings at the lhc operating at @xmath18tev and with an integrated luminosity of 300fb@xmath19 , and an ilc operating at @xmath22tev with an integrated luminosity of 1000fb@xmath19 . in section  [ sec : bounds ] we then compare the predictions for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 obtained in the custodial rs scenario with the current data from the lhc , which can be used to deduce bounds on the relevant model parameters .",
    "our main results are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail the structure of new - physics effects in the couplings of the higgs boson to a pair of electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "these couplings are probed in the off - shell higgs decays @xmath58 and @xmath59 with subsequent decays into four fermions , as well as in the production of the higgs boson in vector - boson fusion or in the higgs - strahlung process , see figure  [ fig : treehiggs ] .",
    "these tree - level processes have in common that they involve the exchange of virtual vector bosons , which implies that in addition to the sm @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons we must consider the effect of the infinite towers of kk resonances .",
    "it is often assumed in the literature that the main effect of new physics on these processes arises from a rescaling of the on - shell @xmath60 couplings .",
    "we show that there are also several other effects that need to be accounted for , namely a possible rescaling of the higgs vev , a modification of the couplings of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons to light fermions , and the exchange of new heavy particles in the off - shell propagators . in rs models all of these effects are indeed present , and accounting for them",
    "correctly will be important for a general definition of the signal strength in terms of the higgs couplings to fermions and vector bosons in section  [ sec : bounds ] .",
    "to good approximation , however , we will show that the main effects can be accounted for by a multiplicative rescaling of the sm decay rates and production cross sections .",
    "for simplicity of presentation , the derivations in this section will be performed for the case of the minimal rs model .",
    "the extension to the case of the custodial model is presented in the appendix .",

    "we refer to models with @xmath196 as _ type - ii brane - higgs models_. in these scenarios , the yukawa - dependent terms in change according to @xcite @xmath197 for the special case @xmath198 , which was sometimes adopted in the literature , this term vanishes .",
    "there is then no contribution to the cp - odd couplings @xmath199 .",
    "one of the predictions of the sm is that the trilinear and quartic higgs couplings can be expressed in terms of the higgs - boson mass and the vev of the higgs field , such that @xmath200 in ( [ eqn : effl ] ) . in rs models these coefficients receive calculable corrections , which for the minimal and the custodial rs models are described by the same formula in terms of the correction to the higgs vev . as long as the higgs sector is localized on or near the ir brane , one obtains @xcite @xmath201 for a kk mass scale of @xmath202tev , one finds a 2.4% ( 4.8% ) reduction of the trilinear coupling and a 4.8% ( 9.6% ) reduction of the quartic coupling in the minimal ( custodial ) rs model .",
    "we mention that moving the higgs field into the bulk would attenuate these deviations and move the couplings closer to their sm values @xcite .",
    "such small deviations will not be measurable by the lhc , and even for a future linear collider like the ilc this is probably out of reach .",
    "therefore , we refrain from presenting a detailed numerical analysis of the higgs self - couplings in the subsequent section .      in the sm , the higgs boson couples to massless gluons and photons only via loop diagrams containing heavy sm particles .",
    "direct couplings , such as the ones contained in the effective lagrangian ( [ eqn : effl ] ) , are absent in the sm . in the context of rs models such direct couplings",
    "are induced at one - loop order via the exchange of heavy kk resonances .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the loop - induced higgs couplings to gluons , which are relevant for the calculation of the gluon - fusion cross section @xmath203 , which is the main higgs production channel at high - energy hadron colliders such as the lhc . in the present work",
    "we concentrate on the case of the higgs sector being localized near the ir brane , which has been discussed in several works @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , the result for the contribution of the infinite tower of kk resonances exhibits a uv sensitivity in the sense that it is sensitive to the precise nature of the localization mechanism .    in the limit where we neglect @xmath182 corrections which in addition are strongly chirality suppressed , the expressions for the induced higgs couplings to two gluons read @xmath204      { { \\text}{tr}}\\,g(\\sqrt2{\\boldsymbol}x_u ) + 3\\,{{\\text}{tr}}\\,g(\\sqrt2{\\boldsymbol}x_d ) + \\varepsilon_u + \\varepsilon_d \\,;~      & \\mbox{custodial rs model . }",

    "for the two scenarios with a brane - localized and a narrow bulk - higgs sector , one finds @xcite @xmath208 so that the effect from the kk tower is approximately equal but of opposite sign in the two scenarios . for a large ensemble of random matrices , one obtains on average @xcite @xmath209 due to the additional factors @xmath206 and  3 in the second case in ( [ eqn : cg ] ) ,",
    "the quark kk tower contribution in the custodial rs model is roughly four times larger than in the minimal rs model .",

    "the cp - odd coupling @xmath215 receives contributions starting at @xmath216 , which are however too small to be of any phenomenological significance . in the subsequent sections we will therefore restrict ourselves to a study of the two cases shown in ( [ eqn : gfunc ] ) .    when the top - quark is integrated out from the effective lagrangian ( [ eqn : effl ] ) , additional contributions to the effective @xmath217 couplings are induced at one - loop order .",
    "they can be accounted for by introducing the effective coefficients @xmath218 which we have normalized such that @xmath219 in the sm .",

    "for example , a recent tree - level analysis of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 parameters yields @xmath245tev ( at 95% cl ) for the mass of the lightest kk gluon and photon resonances @xcite , and somewhat lighter masses are possible for the kk fermion resonances @xcite .",

    "although they are not as pronounced as in the conventional brane - higgs scenarios , significant effects on the higgs coupling to the top quark are still possible .",
