    "for a nice survey see  @xcite or  @xcite .      for @xmath26 , we define the moduli space of abelian differentials @xmath5 as the moduli space of pairs @xmath27 where @xmath0 is a genus @xmath1 ( closed connected ) riemann surface and @xmath28 a non - zero holomorphic @xmath29form defined on @xmath0 .",

    "basically , one can see that as follows .",
    "we first concentrate on the strata of the moduli spaces @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath46 be a representative of an element in @xmath36 , @xmath47 its underlying topological surface , and @xmath48 its singular points .",
    "let us denote by @xmath49 the group morphism @xmath50 defined by @xmath51)=\\int_\\gamma \\omega$ ] for every @xmath19-cycle @xmath52 in @xmath47 relative to @xmath53 .",
    "fix a basis @xmath54 of the free abelian group @xmath55 .",
    "any other element of @xmath36 will be represented by an element having the same underlying surface and the same singular points . with these notations , the map @xmath56 is named the _ period map _ and is a local homeomorphism in a neighbourhood of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore we get a locally one - to - one correspondence between the corresponding stratum of @xmath5 and an open domain in the vector space @xmath57 .",
    "the change of coordinates are affine maps outside the singularities of @xmath58 and produces after a study of the singularities a differentiable orbifold structure on the strata of @xmath5 .",
    "let us now consider the case of a stratum of the moduli space @xmath9 . for every @xmath59 ,",
    "consider the canonical double cover @xmath60 such that @xmath61 for some holomorphic abelian differential @xmath37 on @xmath62 ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "as above , we consider the period map between a neighborhood of the point @xmath63 and an open subset of @xmath64 .",
    "the covering involution @xmath65 induces an involutive linear map on this cohomology vector space .",
    "therefore , this vector space decomposes into two eigenspaces for @xmath66 , say @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with eigenvectors @xmath13 and @xmath69 .",
    "abelian differentials in @xmath67 are precisely those which arise from quadratic differentials on @xmath0 by pull - back by @xmath70 . hence we obtain a one - to - one correspondence between a neighborhood of any point in the corresponding strata of @xmath9 and an open domain of @xmath71 .",
    "next we recall the construction of a measure @xmath72 on each stratum . for that , the tangent space to @xmath5 ( respectively @xmath9 ) at each point contains a lattice : @xmath73 we define the function @xmath74 by the formula @xmath75 .",
    "this is the area of @xmath0 in terms of the flat metric associated to @xmath37 .",
    "the group @xmath76 acts by linear transformations with constant coefficients on the pair of real - valued @xmath19-forms @xmath77 . in the local affine",

    "the dimensions are respectively given by @xmath82 the action of the 1-parameter subgroup of diagonal matrices @xmath83 presents a particular interest for our purpose .",
    "it gives a measure - preserving flow for @xmath84 , preserving each stratum .",
    "this flow is known as the _ teichmller geodesic flow_. note that orbits under @xmath85 project to teichmller geodesics on the moduli space of riemann surfaces @xmath6 .",
    "the next fundamental result motives our study ( see  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the teichmller geodesic flow acts ergodically on each connected component of each stratum of @xmath86 with respect to the measure @xmath84 , which is finite and in the lebesgue class .",
    "a direct corollary of the finiteness of the measure @xmath84 on any stratum of @xmath86 is a proof of the conjecture of keane  @xcite : almost all intervals exchange transformations are uniquely ergodic .      following the theorem of masur and veech , we are interested in the classification of the connected components of the strata of @xmath87 .",
    "veech and arnoux discovered , by direct calculations in terms of _ rauzy classes _ , that some strata are non - connected .",
    "they have proved that @xmath88 is connected , @xmath89 have @xmath20 connected components and @xmath90 have @xmath22 connected components .    recently , in the context of moduli space of abelian differential @xmath5 , kontsevich and zorich ( see  @xcite ) obtained the following complete description .",

    "* the stratum @xmath97 , for any @xmath94 , has two connected components .",
    "any other stratum of abelian differentials on a surface of genus @xmath98 is non - empty and connected .",
    "the description of connected components for strata of genera @xmath99 is similar to the previous one with some exceptions ; we do not present the result here ( see  @xcite ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "kontsevich and zorich use two invariants to obtain this classification : the parity of the spin structure and the hyperellipticity .    in  @xcite , we prove that the first invariant extends trivially to the moduli space @xmath9 .",
    "however , the second produces non - trivial values . in  @xcite",
    ", we classify all strata for which this second one invariant produces non - trivial values . in order to present our statement",
    ", we will recall briefly this construction in the coming section .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that this ( hyperelliptic ) invariant is complete in genera @xmath100 : it classifies precisely the components of the strata of @xmath9 . for small genera",
    ", we obtain a similar result with @xmath16 additional mysterious components .    as a direct corollary of our result and kontsevich - zorich s theorem",
    ", we draw that the ergodic components of the teichmller geodesic flow are given by an explicit list . in particular ,",

    "this paper achieves the classification of connected components of the strata of the moduli spaces @xmath103 announced in the vast program in  @xcite .",

    "holonomy means that the parallel transport of a vector along a small loop going around a conical point brings the vector back to itself or to its negative .",
    "this implies that all cone angles are integer multiples of @xmath70 .",
