    "the immune system is one of the body s major regulatory systems .",
    "one of its main known functions is to fight agents that are potentially harmful to the body , including foreign agents and body cells whose behavior is abnormal or dangerous , as in the case of cancerous or virus - infected cells .",
    "these and other immune functions arise from complex interactions involving numerous molecules and cells , as well as some of the body s organs .",
    "the immunity an individual is born with is the _",
    "innate immunity_. it is highly nonspecific , in the sense that the mechanisms associated with it are not the result of adaptation during previous encounters with extraneous agents , but is nonetheless capable of destroying several types of pathogens .",
    "the individual s _ acquired immunity _ , on the other hand , is the result of the continual exposition of the body to the action of extraneous substances , called _ antigens _ , and tends to become more specific at each new encounter with the same antigen .    of the several players involved in acquired immunity , the molecules known as",
    "_ cytokines _ and _ antibodies _ , and the cells known as _ b cells _ , _ helper t cells _ , and _",
    "cytotoxic t cells _ ,",
    "suffice for a description of the basic mechanism at a very high level of abstraction .",
    "when a b cell recognizes an antigen with which its receptors have high affinity , the cell becomes stimulated and eventually displays on its surface portions of the antigen .",
    "this is one of the necessary signals for helper t cells to become activated and liberate cytokines that , in turn , signal the previously stimulated b cells to proliferate in a process that leads to the production of antibodies that can bind to the antigen and lead to its destruction .",
    "such a mechanism is the essence of the so - called _ humoral immunity _ , the one that takes place in the body s fluids ( or humors ) and is mediated by antibodies .",
    "the other type of acquired immunity , known as _ cellular immunity _ , is also triggered by the cytokines that the activated helper t cells liberate , and culminates in the destruction of the cells displaying antigen portions on their surfaces by the cytotoxic t cells .",
    "this basic mechanism of antigen detection and destruction lies at the core of acquired immunity , but several higher functions of the immune system are known to take place that need to be accounted for on more solid theoretical underpinnings .",
    "two notorious such functions are the immune memory and the ability of the system to discriminate between self and nonself entities .",
    "the leading theoretical framework to explain these and other phenomena is the _ clonal selection theory _",
    "@xcite : groups of b cells with similar recognition capabilities , or _ clones _ , are selected for proliferation .",
    "according to this theory , some of the b cells that result from the proliferation elicited by the antigen become memory cells , which in turn fight that same antigen more effectively when it is next encountered .",
    "as for the proper discrimination between self and nonself entities , the current best candidate explanations seem to come from the `` danger theory '' discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which postulates the need for more specific signals for t - cell activation .",
    "the clonal selection theory is philosophically reductionist , meaning that the explanations for more and more phenomena are expected to come from discovering more and more details on how the several molecules and cells involved in acquired immunity interact .",
    "this inherent bias may have caused several important properties of the immune system to be discovered belatedly , as for example the involvement of the immune system in several phenomena related to morphogenesis @xcite . together with the theory s having so far failed to account for various other immune - related phenomena , particularly those that bear on autoimmunity , this bias has resulted in considerable criticism ( although , arguably , some of it appears misdirected @xcite ) .",
    "another major theoretical framework in modern immunology is the _ functional _ ( or _ idiotypic _ ) _ network theory _ @xcite .",
    "this theory arose in an attempt to address several questions that the clonal selection theory , being centered on the antigen , seemed unable to answer .",
    "for example , how is the b - cell repertoire regulated before antigens are ever encountered ? departing from experimental evidence that b cells and t cells interact with one another in much the same way as they interact with antigens , the functional network theory postulates that such interactions lead to a self - organized system out of which immune functions like the immune memory and the self - nonself discrimination ability emerge naturally .",
    "the functional network theory was met with enthusiasm originally , but interest in it has waned considerably of late .",
    "the reasons for this include the difficulty of verifying the theory s usefulness in practice and also the fact that it too , like the clonal selection theory , remained centered on the antigen , thereby weakening the interest in it as an opposing theory .",
    "but the functional network theory continues to attract the interest of those who recognize the aesthetic appeal of its elegant systemic approach and that of other similar autonomous systems @xcite .",
    "also , it seems that , of the two theoretical frameworks , this is the most promising one in terms of where insight into autoimmunity is expected to come from .",
    "coupled with recent studies on the appearance of immunity in organisms that never had contact with antigens , these observations are helping restore the functional network theory to a place of great relevance in theoretical immunology @xcite .    at various levels of abstraction , and incorporating the postulates of both clonal selection and the functional network ,",
    "several proposals have been put forward of how to model the functioning of the immune system mathematically @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new model of the functional network . in our model ,",
    "the network is represented by a weighted directed graph whose weights correspond to the degrees of affinity involved in humoral immunity , especially those related to b cells and antigens .",
    "our model is built on the b model of @xcite and @xcite , and contributes a new concept in immune - network modeling , namely the evolution of specificity by the dynamic updating of the graph s weights .",
    "what we have found through several different computational experiments on this model is that it is capable of reproducing , in qualitative terms , several of the main immune - system attributes , including the response to antigens , the immune memory , and some degree of self - nonself differentiation .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized into five additional sections .",
    "we start in section  [ fnet ] with a brief review of the most relevant aspects of the functional network theory , then proceed to section  [ bmodel ] for the relevant aspects of the b model .",
    "our model is introduced in section  [ model ] , and in section  [ results ] we report on our computational experiments .",
    "we conclude with closing remarks in section  [ concl ] .",
    "b - cell receptors are known as _ paratopes_. the b cells that result from b - cell proliferation have paratopes that are not exact copies of those of the original cell , but rather are the result of the high mutation rates of the process known as _ hypermutation _ @xcite . the antigen regions that can be recognized by the immune system",
    "are called _",
    "epitopes_. ultimately , the immune response is the result of cell activation due to the affinity , as given by the complementarity of several types of properties , between paratopes and epitopes .",
    "the immune system s repertoire of paratopes is limited , so in order for its recognition capabilities to be suitably wide - ranging , it has been argued that some conditions need to be satisfied @xcite .",
    "these are that each paratope must recognize a small group of slightly different epitopes , that the repertoire of paratopes must be in the order of at least @xmath0 , and that paratopes must be randomly distributed along the possible range of different paratopes ( itself limited to a maximum of @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "the key observation at the core of the functional network theory comes from a closer look at the structure of paratopes .",
    "there are light and heavy chains , and in each chain constant and variable regions .",
    "the variable regions can bind to antigens and are known to contain sub - regions that can be recognized by other paratopes .",
    "that is , b cells also have epitopes .",
    "the group of epitopes of a b cell is called an _ idiotype _ , while each idiotypic epitope is known as an _",
    "idiotope_.    it follows from this observation that b cells can recognize one another .",
    "a group of b cells having similar paratopes ( a clone , as in the clonal selection theory ) is characterized by this set of similar paratopes and also by the corresponding collective idiotype .",
    "these paratope - idiotype pairs , denoted generically by @xmath2-@xmath3 , are illustrated in figure  [ network ] . in this figure ,",
    "an arrow is drawn from a clone s idiotype to another clone s set of paratopes to indicate that the former clone stimulates ( is recognized by ) the latter .",
    "equivalently , one may think of the arrow as indicating that the latter clone inhibits ( recognizes and seeks to eliminate ) the former .    using figure  [ network ] as an example , the functioning of the network can be intuitively grasped as follows . before an antigen comes into the body ,",
    "the network remains in population equilibrium .",
    "clone @xmath4-@xmath5 stimulates clone @xmath6-@xmath7 , which in turn inhibits clone @xmath4-@xmath5 .",
    "meanwhile , clone @xmath8-@xmath9 stimulates @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath4-@xmath5 inhibits @xmath8-@xmath9 .",
    "this stimulation - inhibition interplay maintains the clonal population s balance in the network .",
    "when antigens are introduced in the system and interfere with clone @xmath4-@xmath5 , they cause its population to increase , thus taking the network out of balance . both the stimulatory action of @xmath4-@xmath5 over @xmath6-@xmath7 and the inhibitory action of @xmath4-@xmath5 over @xmath8-@xmath9 increase , which leads the population of @xmath6-@xmath7 to increase and that of @xmath8-@xmath9 to decrease . as a result",
    ", @xmath6-@xmath7 inhibits @xmath4-@xmath5 more intensely , while @xmath8-@xmath9 stimulates @xmath4-@xmath5 less intensely .",
    "these two forces then concur toward making the population of @xmath4-@xmath5 decrease , and eventually let it stabilize once again .",
    "as we indicated earlier , the affinity between paratopes and idiotypes is due to the complementarity that exists between molecules in terms of geometric or physicochemical characteristics . if @xmath10 is the number of relevant characteristics , then a @xmath10-dimensional vector space , known as the _ shape space _ @xcite , can be used to formalize the notion of affinity .",
    "a point @xmath11 in the shape space can be taken to represent some multimolecular structure as far as the @xmath10 characteristics are concerned .",
    "one possibility to indicate the affinity between this structure and another is to start by identifying the point in the shape space that corresponds to the structure that has the greatest affinity with it .",
    "if we use symmetry with respect to @xmath12 , for example , then this point is @xmath13 .    beyond this characterization of maximum affinity ,",
    "several other possibilities exist for the treatment of features of interest when studying the immune system .",
    "for example , suppose we identify a certain clone @xmath14 with a point @xmath15 in the shape space . in order to represent the property that @xmath14 can be stimulated by various other clones , not only by the clone @xmath16 of maximum affinity to @xmath14 ,",
    "a sphere of small radius can be used to represent a set of clones with idiotypes similar to those of @xmath16 .",
    "this sphere is centered on the point @xmath17 of the shape space that is identified with @xmath16 .",
    "every point inside the sphere corresponds to a clone that can stimulate clone @xmath14 with some significant degree of affinity , but this degree is ever smaller as the point is located farther from @xmath17 @xcite .    one prominent model that employs the shape - space formalism is the b model .",
    "this model has appeared as numerous variations of the same basic idea @xcite , but we limit ourselves to describing only the key elements on which we build in section  [ model ] .",
    "the b model is one of the simplest mathematical representations of the immune system : it only seeks to describe the dynamics of b - cell populations , and takes into account the roles of t cells and antibodies only implicitly . for a system with @xmath18 clones ,",
    "the b - model equation for clone @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , is @xmath21x_i(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the population of clone @xmath19 at time @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the rate at which new clones are inserted in the system by the bone marrow , @xmath25 is the rate of clone proliferation , @xmath26 is the rate of clone death , @xmath27 is an activation function , and @xmath28 is the so - called field of clone @xmath19 at time @xmath23 .",
    "the field of clone @xmath19 depends on the affinity between clone @xmath19 and the other clones .",
    "it is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represents the symmetric affinity between clones @xmath19 and @xmath32 .",
    "this affinity can be determined from neighborhoods in the shape space , for example , as we indicated earlier .",
    "the activation function @xmath27 is intended to model the three possible activation states of a clone : the virgin state , in which the clone is not yet stimulated ; the immune state , in which the clone proliferates ; and the inhibited state , in which proliferation stops .",
    "modeling the inhibited state , in special , is important because it provides an indirect means of precluding clonal proliferation due to the overabundance of stimulation , as in the case of self - antigens , and thereby a means of accounting for the elimination of self - recognizing paratopes that is known to occur in the immune system .",
    "one possibility for @xmath27 is to use the window function @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 delimit the possible values of a clone s field if it is to remain in the immune state . by ( [ bmodelact ] )",
    ", the clone remains virgin if the field is less than @xmath34 , it enters the immune state if the field is between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , or it is in the inhibited state if the field is greater than @xmath35 .",
    "some assumptions are implicit in the b model that must be brought to the fore clearly .",
    "one of them concerns the insertion of new clones in the system by the bone marrow . by adopting the constant rate @xmath24 for all clones",
    ", it has been assumed that the bone marrow generates b - cell paratopes uniformly randomly across the entire range of possibilities , independently of what may be taking place in the immune system ( the preferential generation of b cells with certain paratopes that is known to take place when a specific antigen is being fought  cf .",
    "@xcite  is thus ignored ) .",
    "it has been assumed , furthermore , that this range of possibilities is restricted to the paratopes of the @xmath18 different clones .",
    "another assumption is that the parameter @xmath25 suffices to summarize the role of helper t cells in the proliferation of stimulated b cells for all clones , and similarly for the parameter @xmath26 with respect to the destruction of b cells .",
    "like the b model , our model of humoral immunity concentrates on the dynamics of b - cell populations and only considers explicitly one of the other major participants , the bone marrow .",
    "it also inherits from the b model the assumptions discussed in section  [ bmodel ] regarding the use of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 to model the functioning of the bone marrow and the proliferation of clones , respectively .    notwithstanding these similarities with the b model , the model we introduce in this section contributes four major innovations to the modeling of the functional network .",
    "the first innovation is the use of clusters of clones , as opposed to clones , as the basic modeling unit .",
    "each cluster is to be thought of as a small sphere in the shape space containing clones that , to some degree , have paratopes ( and hence idiotypes ) with similar geometric and physicochemical properties .",
    "the adoption of clusters makes the implicit assumption represented by the @xmath24 parameter less stringent , since now new paratopes generated by the bone marrow are assumed to fall within one of the existing clusters , not clones .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the total number of clusters .",
    "the second innovation is the explicit use of a directed graph on @xmath36 nodes ( one for each cluster ) to represent the interactions among clusters .",
    "a similar graph has been implicit since section  [ fnet ] , for example in figure  [ network ] and also in the underlying connections among clones  via the @xmath37s  in the b model .",
    "the explicit adoption of the directed graph allows any connection pattern on the @xmath36 nodes to be explored , and indirectly a multitude of possible complementarity criteria among the clones of different clusters .",
    "we denote our directed graph by @xmath38 . in @xmath38 ,",
    "an edge exists directed from cluster @xmath19 to cluster @xmath32 with @xmath39 to indicate that the clones in cluster @xmath19 have the capability of stimulating ( being recognized by ) those in cluster @xmath32 .",
    "associated with this edge is a positive weight , @xmath40 , indicating the average affinity with which this stimulation occurs .",
    "the same edge can , of course , be examined from a dual perspective : clones in cluster @xmath32 have the capability of inhibiting ( recognizing and seeking to eliminate ) those in cluster @xmath19 .",
    "this alternative view leads to another edge weight , @xmath41 , indicating the average affinity with which the inhibition occurs .",
    "of course , stimulation and inhibition between the two clusters occur with the same degree of affinity , so we have @xmath42 . or , equivalently , @xmath43 .",
    "we do not make this assumption . ]",
    "the third innovation that our model contributes is a more detailed treatment of b - cell removal from the system . while in the b model",
    "this is accounted for exclusively by the @xmath26 parameter , we make a distinction between b - cell removal by inhibition by other clones and removal by other causes ( e.g. , by apoptosis ) .",
    "the former will be accounted for by a new term introduced in our model s equations , while the latter will continue to be modeled by the @xmath26 parameter .",
    "the last innovation we wish to highlight has also been the major motivation in this study , and has to do with modeling the evolution of the functional network s specificity .",
    "the idea to be captured by the model is the following .",
    "when cluster @xmath19 stimulates cluster @xmath32 , those clones in cluster @xmath32 having greater affinity with the stimulus tend to proliferate more than the others . as a result",
    ", the distribution of clones in the population of cluster @xmath32 is altered and the cluster becomes more specific in terms of its ability to respond to that stimulus . when the stimulus is withdrawn , the preferential proliferation in cluster @xmath32 ceases and the random insertion of new clones by the bone marrow tends to homogenize the clone population in that cluster once again . in this case",
    ", cluster @xmath32 becomes less specific with respect to the stimulus .",
    "the notion of stimulus here is intended to capture a quantity that is proportional to both the idiotypic population in cluster @xmath19 and the stimulatory weight of cluster @xmath19 upon cluster @xmath32 , @xmath40 . in our model ,",
    "the specificity of a cluster , say @xmath32 , is associated with the collective stimulatory weights of all the edges that in @xmath38 are directed toward @xmath32 , that is , @xmath40 for every cluster @xmath19 such that an edge directed from @xmath19 to @xmath32 exists in @xmath38 .",
    "we allow for the evolution of specificity by letting such weights be dynamic ( and , thus , their inhibitory counterparts as well ) .",
    "this is done in such a way that the instantaneous change incurred by weight @xmath40 is proportional to how close the stimulus provided by cluster @xmath19 is to being the greatest individual stimulus received by cluster @xmath32 at that instant .",
    "this is , clearly , a hebbian - style rule for the dynamics of specificity .",
    "we provide more details shortly .",
    "our model s equations are given in terms of a discrete - time parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the equation that describes the evolution of the population of clones in cluster @xmath19 , for @xmath45 , is the extension of ( [ bmodeleq ] ) given by @xmath46x_i(t)-qh^-_i(t).\\ ] ] in ( [ modeleq ] ) , @xmath22 is the population of cluster @xmath19 at time @xmath23 and @xmath47 is the rate of clone removal by inhibition .",
    "the field of cluster @xmath19 at time @xmath23 is no longer given as the field of a clone in the b model , but rather is split into a stimulatory field , @xmath48 , and an inhibitory field , @xmath49 .",
    "the activation function is no longer the @xmath27 of ( [ bmodelact ] ) , but rather a `` nodal '' @xmath50also a zero - one function  to be discussed in more detail shortly .",
    "the remaining entities in ( [ modeleq ] ) are all the same as in the b model .",
    "while most of what is intended with ( [ modeleq ] ) is self - explanatory , we feel the fundamental difference between the addition of new clones by stimulation and the removal of clones by inhibition requires a little further elaboration . while , understandably , new clones are inserted in proportion to how many there are already , the term that accounts for the removal of clones by inhibition is in ( [ modeleq ] ) independent of @xmath22 .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the first stems from the fact that the inhibitory potential of a cluster upon cluster @xmath19 at time @xmath23 is the same regardless of the particular magnitude that the population of cluster @xmath19 has at that time , since it ultimately depends on the populations of other clusters . considering that the removal of clones from cluster @xmath19 by inhibition occurs through the binding of clones in those other clusters to clones in cluster @xmath19",
    ", we see that the number of clones that get removed by inhibition from time @xmath23 to time @xmath51 is nearly independent of the population of cluster @xmath19 at time @xmath23 .",
    "an exception , of course , is the case of a very low population at time @xmath23 , in which case , to become completely rigorous , ( [ modeleq ] ) should be rewritten to prevent @xmath52 from falling below zero .",
    "but we refrain from doing so explicitly for the sake of clarity .",
    "the second reason is a little more subtle .",
    "consider some hypothetical scenario in which a sudden populational growth occurs in cluster @xmath19 .",
    "in this scenario , a dependence of the inhibitory term upon @xmath22 would lead to a sudden increase in the number of clones removed as well , which in turn could only be explained if a sudden growth were to take place also in the populations of the clusters exerting the inhibition .",
    "this , however , would only be plausible if we were considering antibody , instead of b - cell , populations .",
    "thus , the several rates appearing in ( [ modeleq ] ) are to be regarded as being dimensionally distinct . while @xmath24 is expressed as a number of clones , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "are given as nondimensional quantities .",
    "the rate @xmath47 , in turn , is a number of clones per unit of the inhibitory field .    before we describe the stimulatory and inhibitory fields of a cluster , we need additional notation .",
    "we let @xmath53 denote the amount of antigen present in cluster @xmath19 at time @xmath23 , i.e. , antigens with epitopes similar to the idiotypes of cluster @xmath19 .",
    "we also let @xmath54 denote one of the aforementioned stimuli , specifically the stimulus exerted by cluster @xmath19 upon cluster @xmath32 at time @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , @xmath53 participates in the stimulus of cluster @xmath19 on cluster @xmath32 on equal footing with @xmath22 , so we have @xmath55.\\ ] ] one should notice , in ( [ stimeq ] ) , that the time - dependency of the weights is now accounted for explicitly ; this is how weights will be denoted henceforth .",
    "also , for notational convenience we assume @xmath56 whenever @xmath19 and @xmath32 are such that no directed edge exists from @xmath19 to @xmath32 , including the case of @xmath57 .",
    "the stimulatory and inhibitory fields of cluster @xmath19 are given , respectively , by @xmath58g_e\\left(s_{ji}(t)\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 the @xmath60 that appears in ( [ sfield ] ) and ( [ ifield ] ) is yet another zero - one activation function , this one related to the edges of @xmath38 .",
    "the node- and edge - related activation functions , respectively @xmath50 and @xmath60 , are such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 the @xmath50 in ( [ nodeact ] ) is a step function at @xmath63 , while the @xmath60 in ( [ edgeact ] ) is the same window function of the b model ( cf .",
    "( [ bmodelact ] ) ) with suitably adapted parameter values .",
    "together with ( [ sfield ] ) and ( [ ifield ] ) , they are meant to elicit the following behavior from ( [ modeleq ] ) .",
    "the stimulatory field of cluster @xmath19 is given by the sum of every stimulus on that cluster that is neither too weak ( below @xmath34 ) nor too strong ( above @xmath35 ) ; if nonzero , this stimulatory field causes the clones in cluster @xmath19 to proliferate .",
    "similarly , only clusters that cluster @xmath19 stimulates inside the @xmath64 $ ] window contribute to the inhibitory field of cluster @xmath19 and thereby to the removal by inhibition of clones from cluster @xmath19 .",
    "this use of the function @xmath60 can be thought of as a distribution of the role played by the function @xmath27 in the b model through the edges that in @xmath38 are incoming to cluster @xmath19 .",
    "when the windowing mechanism is thus distributed , each individual stimulus on @xmath19 must lie within the desired bounds to be effective , not simply the combined stimuli .",
    "this is a more reasonable approach when the graph s nodes stand for clusters of clones , not simply for clones , and therefore represent a much greater variety of paratopes and idiotypes .",
    "the removal of clones by inhibition is now also more selective , as we already remarked , and also the removal of antigens , which for cluster @xmath19 we model by @xmath65 where we have refrained from explicitly indicating that @xmath66 must be prevented from falling below zero .    in ( [ atgremoval ] )",
    ", @xmath67 is the rate of antigen removal , the same for all clusters , and is expressed in antigen units per unit of the inhibitory field .",
    "note that the process described in ( [ atgremoval ] ) is entirely analogous to the process of clone removal by inhibition modeled by the last term of ( [ modeleq ] ) . in particular , by the definition of the inhibitory field in ( [ ifield ] ) , antigen removal only happens at cluster @xmath19 if at least one other cluster is stimulated by cluster @xmath19 within the corresponding edge s window . as a by - product",
    ", we see that parameter values can be chosen so that any antigen appearing in overwhelming quantities , like self - antigens , stimulates no cluster and consequently undergoes no attempts at removal .",
    "we finalize the section by returning to the dynamics of specificity . for @xmath39 ,",
    "our criterion for the update of the stimulatory weight of cluster @xmath19 on cluster @xmath32 from time @xmath23 to time @xmath51 is based on the set @xmath68 , which we define to be the set of clusters whose stimuli on cluster @xmath32 at time @xmath23 are , individually , within the @xmath64 $ ] window .",
    "notice that we have placed no restrictions on @xmath19 or @xmath32 beyond their being distinct from each other , which means that even pairs of clusters not currently connected in a certain direction in the graph are considered for weight update in that direction .    if @xmath69 , then @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath72 $ ] intended to capture the effect of hypermutation on inter - cluster affinity .",
    "this form of weight update happens , in particular , if @xmath54 is too large due to the presence of a massive amount of antigen in cluster @xmath19 , so self - antigens cause no weight changes beyond what is effected randomly .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 according to ( [ weightupd1 ] ) , the value of @xmath75 for @xmath73 is either expanded or contracted before it is added to @xmath71 to yield @xmath76 . the factor determining this expansion or contraction",
    "has the hebbian nature we discussed earlier : within the set @xmath68 , the weight associated with the largest stimulus on cluster @xmath32 undergoes the greatest expansion ( it is multiplied by @xmath77 ) ; all other weights undergo proportionally smaller expansions or may even get contracted ( in the worst case , by a factor of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 ) .",
    "what dictates whether a weight is expanded or contracted is whether the corresponding stimulus is above or below half the largest stimulus , respectively .",
    "such that @xmath80 , so the expansion / contraction factor in ( [ weightupd1 ] ) becomes @xmath81 . in this case",
    ", the threshold between expansion and contraction occurs as the stimulus @xmath54 becomes less than @xmath82 .",
    "we use @xmath83 throughout , though . ]",
    "the parameter @xmath84 can be chosen in the interval @xmath85 $ ] to regulate the range of possible weight expansion or contraction . that solves @xmath86 .",
    "but @xmath87 has a different value for each cluster and is also time - varying .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath88 comes from setting @xmath34 , and hence @xmath87 , to @xmath89 . ]    while ( [ weightupd0 ] ) and ( [ weightupd1 ] ) express the essential principle of our weight - update mechanism , a few observations are in order regarding some crucial details .",
    "first of all , once again complete mathematical rigor requires both ( [ weightupd0 ] ) and ( [ weightupd1 ] ) to be rewritten to prevent @xmath76 from becoming negative .",
    "in addition , no weight is ever allowed to grow without bounds , being subjected to an upper bound @xmath90 representing a conceptual maximum that the affinity between the clones of any two clusters can attain .",
    "a more precise formulation of our criterion for updating weights is then the following .",
    "let @xmath91 be such that @xmath92 if @xmath69 , or such that @xmath93 if @xmath73 .",
    "then @xmath94    by ( [ weightupd2 ] ) , it is possible for @xmath76 to become zero . by the definition of the directed graph @xmath38 , we take this to be synonymous with the disappearance from @xmath38 of the edge from @xmath19 to @xmath32 between times @xmath23 and @xmath51 . similarly , @xmath76 may also become positive by the addition of the @xmath71 term in ( [ weightupd0 ] ) , meaning that the edge from @xmath19 to @xmath32 may reappear in @xmath38 ( or appear for the first time , if it never existed ) from time @xmath23 to time @xmath51 . in the sequel , whenever needed we refer to @xmath38 more precisely as @xmath95 to indicate the dynamic character of its edge set .",
    "we have conducted extensive computational experimentation in order to discover the properties that emerge out of the model introduced in section  [ model ] .",
    "naturally , the different possibilities for combined parameter values are overwhelmingly too many , so we have settled for a fixed combination that was found to elicit qualitatively interesting behavior .",
    "the parameter values we have employed in all the experiments we report henceforth are the ones given in table [ params ] .",
    "one possible exception to this conclusion may be the degree distributions of @xmath96 for @xmath97 ( that is , well into the system s steady regime ) .",
    "these two distributions are re - plotted from figures  [ degdist2](a ) and ( b ) in figure  [ distst28](a ) , where we can see a glimmer of the straight - line behavior that characterizes power laws when plotted against doubly - logarithmic scales .",
    "confirmation that such a behavior is really present depends on investigating substantially larger systems and also different values of @xmath98 to see what trends exist .",
    "one example already appears in figure  [ distst28](b ) for the same system size as we have been investigating but with @xmath99 , that is , for a graph significantly sparser than @xmath100 .",
    "seemingly , the presence of power - law distributions is less likely for such a value of @xmath98 .",
    "the authors acknowledge partial support from cnpq , capes , the pronex initiative of brazil s mct under contract 41.96.0857.00 , and a faperj bbp grant .",
