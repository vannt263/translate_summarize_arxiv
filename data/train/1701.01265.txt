    "we call   the `` variational heat equation '' , because it can be derived from a variational principle , similar to the variational wave equation  @xcite , see   below .",
    "the variational heat equation arises in the context of the continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals as a model for the dynamics of the director field .",
    "liquid crystals are materials in a state of matter between the solid and the liquid state . in the case of uniaxial nematic liquid crystals",
    ", this means that the elongated molecules can move freely like in a fluid , but tend to align along the same direction like in a crystal . on a macroscopic scale",
    "such a state can be described by two vector fields , the velocity field and the so - called director field , which are governed by the ericksen - leslie equations  @xcite .",
    "the director field is a unit vector field that gives the average direction of the molecules at each point .    to arrive at equation  , we assume the simplified setting of a uniaxial nematic with no flow and a director field @xmath9 that lies in the @xmath10 plane and varies only in @xmath11-direction",
    ". then the director can be described by an angle @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the oseen - frank energy , which models the tendency of the director to align along the same direction everywhere , reduces to @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the oseen - frank elastic constants corresponding to bend and splay deformations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the director is subject to the dissipation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rotational viscosity coefficient .",
    "together , a variational principle applied to the energy law @xmath20 and scaling @xmath21 gives  , see  @xcite .",
    "a similar model is the variational wave equation  @xcite , @xmath22 which is derived in the same way from the oseen - frank energy , but neglecting dissipation and instead including inertia in the form of the kinetic energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rotational inertia of the director , scaled to @xmath25 in  .",
    "typical values for the elastic constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 in   are of order @xmath26@xmath27 , the dissipation @xmath19 is of order @xmath28@xmath29 , and the rotational inertia @xmath24 is of order @xmath30 ,  @xcite . on small length scales ,",
    "the term from the elastic energy and the dissipation can be of the same order .",
    "the inertia term however is usually dominated by the dissipation  @xcite , therefore   is a more suitable model than   in most physical settings .    from a mathematical point of view , if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are strictly positive , i.e. , @xmath31 , equation   is a nonlinear , uniformly parabolic equation . while  , and also the combination of   and   where both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are included , does not possess a unique classical solution  @xcite , standard theory of nonlinear parabolic equations guarantees well - posedness of  , see  @xcite .",
    "we are therefore interested in the degenerate case of   where @xmath34 is allowed to vanish at some points , i.e. , if @xmath34 is given by  , in the case that @xmath35 or @xmath36",
    ". solutions of degenerate parabolic equations are not necessarily smooth or unique , therefore new concepts of solutions , e.g. , weak solutions , entropy solutions , or viscosity solutions are required . in the case of  , a formal calculation shows that there is no maximum principle for @xmath37 , but for @xmath38 ( see section  [ sec : bounds ] ) . at points where @xmath39 vanishes",
    ", this allows for gradient blow - up .",
    "the goal of this paper is to design a convergent numerical scheme for  .",
    "the form of the right - hand side and the resulting lack of a gradient bound suggests that one should transform   first .",
    "one possibility to do this is to define @xmath40 then   becomes @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the inverse of @xmath43 .",
    "for this equation it is straightforward to obtain an @xmath44 bound and one can also show uniqueness of weak solutions . if we assume @xmath31 , a simple finite difference scheme based on central differences and averages in space can be shown to converge to a weak solution using aubin - lions lemma , see also  @xcite for examples in a similar setting .",
    "if however @xmath45 for some @xmath12 , then   is not necessarily finite and a bound on @xmath46 does not follow directly from the @xmath44 bound .",
    "an alternative transformation of   is @xmath47 so @xmath48 satisfies @xmath49 the transformation @xmath50 and its inverse @xmath51 are well - defined for any @xmath4 if @xmath34 vanishes only on single points .",
    "it is also possible to show _ a priori _ bounds for both @xmath48 and @xmath52 in @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( functions of bounded total variation ) , see section  [ sec : bounds ] .",
    "however ,   does not guarantee uniqueness of solutions . indeed",

    "@xcite showed that for the special case where @xmath55 , weak solutions of   ( defined in a standard way , see section  [ sec : definitions ] ) are not unique . to choose the physically relevant solution , they define `` viscosity solutions '' which are obtained by taking the limit of classical solutions of the equation with @xmath31 or suitable initial data . in the setting of",
    ", these viscosity solutions correspond to sending @xmath16 or @xmath17 to @xmath56 or choosing the solution that corresponds to a solution of  .",
    "ughi et al.s concept of viscosity solutions is not generally the same as lions theory of viscosity solutions for degenerate parabolic equations  @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness theory of the latter is not applicable here , because the right - hand side of  , or  , is not proper .",
    "the scheme that we will present in this paper discretizes  .",
    "based on discrete versions of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 bounds on @xmath48 and @xmath52 , we use kolmogorov s compactness theorem to show that the numerical approximations for both @xmath48 and @xmath52 converge strongly in @xmath57 .",
    "the strong convergence of the derivative is important , because the weak formulation of   includes nonlinear terms in  @xmath52 .",
    "passing to the limit in the definition of the scheme , we prove that a subsequence of the numerical solutions converges to a weak solution as @xmath58 .",
    "our numerical experiments confirm the nonunqiueness properties discussed above .",

    ", this type of solutions shows clearly that the gradient is unbounded .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : definitions ] we will define the scheme for  , introduce the notion of weak solutions , and state our convergence result .",
    "section  [ sec : bounds ] contains discrete _ a priori _ bounds , which are based on harten s lemma and motivated by formal calculations in the continuous case .",
    "time continuity is shown in section  [ sec : time ] and the convergence proof is carried out in section  [ sec : convergence ] . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we present a series of numerical experiments that confirm the convergence result and highlight the nonuniqueness properties of  .",

    "otherwise , we require that the time step @xmath82 and grid size @xmath83 satisfy the cfl condition @xmath84 for the discrete derivatives @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the scheme defined by   becomes @xmath87 we will use these forms below to get _ a priori _ bounds on @xmath88 .",

    "the @xmath54 bound for @xmath101 will be important in the convergence proof , because strong convergence for both @xmath48 and its first derivative is needed to pass to the limit in the third term of the weak formulation  . before turning to the discrete setting ,",
