    "nuclear level density ( ld ) has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental investigations such as analyses of fusion and fission reactions for a wide range of isotopes and reactor structure designs .",
    "investigations of the problems related to nuclear ld also clarifies some basic properties of the nuclear matter such as super - fluidity , nuclear shell , pairing and collective effects .    up to date , the independent particle model of fermi gas ( fg ) model after the bethe s ld expression @xcite and its various modifications @xcite are frequently used in describing the corresponding experimental data including the ld of discrete energy levels and s - wave neutron resonance densities , as well as in the description of nuclear reaction product particle spectra [ 7 - 13 ] .",
    "the so - called composite gilbert - cameron ( gc ) model @xcite unifies further fg model with the constant temperature ( ct ) approximation .",
    "these models however do not involve the collective excitation mechanism of the nucleus in the form of collective vibrations and rotation effects in an explicit manner , despite these effects may be described somehow by the ld parameter ( @xmath1 ) and the concerning energy shift ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the explicit collective effect contributions to ld s are well described , for instance , in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite and in the ld systematic given in @xcite .",
    "apart from such effects , in these works the ld parameter ( @xmath1 ) is supposed to be excitation energy ( @xmath3 ) dependent .",
    "the need for the inclusion of an energy dependent ld parameter arises due to shell effects in the ld descriptions . when this term is used in the generalized super - fluid ( gs ) nuclear model , the related parameter @xmath1 changes the shape of ld function above the critical energy @xmath4 , characterizing transitions from super - fluid to normal state . while the microscopic models of nuclear ld includes both hartee - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) model of nuclear structure and combinatorial model analysis of ld s @xcite .",
    "all the models mentioned above aim to describe the observed ld s accurately in a wide range of isotopes and excitation energies , which is not yet accomplished",
    ". therefore introduction of new models and theories in describing ld s is still required in theoretical nuclear physics .    within this context",
    ", the motivation behind the present work is to test the earlier ld expression of landau theory of a nucleus described by @xcite ( later abbreviated by l ) for the theoretical analysis of nuclear ld s in the region of both discrete nuclear energy range and at the nuclear excitations corresponding to the s - wave neutron resonance energies .",
    "to our knowledge , such an investigation has never been appeared so far in the related literature .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] gives a necessary brief theoretical background of landau s theory of nuclear ld and description of the models used through the present work .",
    "comparison of the model findings is the subject of sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in this theory nuclear system is considered as `` quantum liquid '' of nucleon system in which interaction between the particles is significant . according to the statistical theory at low excitation energies , nuclear free energy ( @xmath5 ) dependence on nuclear temperature ( @xmath6 ) may be expressed as @xcite    @xmath7    in the above equation , normally nuclear ground states are admitted to be with zero excitation and the derivation uses nernst theorem , that is the property of quantum systems , and accordingly linear dependence on @xmath6 is dropped . introducing @xmath8 entropy ( @xmath9 ) and excitation energy ( @xmath3 ) may be written as    @xmath10    the number of nuclear states ( @xmath11 ) and the nuclear state density ( @xmath12 ) of l theory are expressed as @xmath13 the spin ( @xmath14 ) dependent nuclear ld formula then with a great accuracy appears as ( @xcite )    @xmath15    where    @xmath16    with @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) being the rigid body moment of inertia of spherical nuclei in which @xmath19 and @xmath20 together with @xmath21 being the nucleon mass while @xmath22 denotes the mass of nuclei .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 denotes the spin cutoff parameter , more specifically , the rigid body ( rb ) spin cutoff parameter .",
    "further , introducing a new parameter @xmath24 , which is identified as ld parameter of l theory , we have the traditional well - known expression for the excitation energy    @xmath25    and substituting eq . into eq . and",
    "calculating @xmath26 for @xmath27 one finds ,    @xmath28    where @xmath3 and @xmath1 are expressed in terms of mev s .",
    "may be easily generalized for different models as    @xmath29    in which @xmath30 is the theoretical or model state density function of interest .",
    "note that this expression is applicable for each parity .",
    "the total ld defined as in the work of @xcite    @xmath31    includes however , excitation energy ( @xmath3 ) , spin ( @xmath14 ) and parity ( @xmath32 ) dependent level density , @xmath33 . for equal distribution of parities @xmath33 is expressed as    @xmath34    substituting eq . and eq.in eq . , summing over @xmath32 , and replacing the summation over @xmath14 in eq .",
    "by the related integration one find that    @xmath35    while , @xmath36 .",
    "hence , ct approximation , fg model and l in eq . can be expressed as    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath6 in eq .",
    "is the constant temperature parameter for a given nucleus whereas in eq .",
    "@xmath40 is given by eq . and , similarly , @xmath1 and @xmath41 are the ld parameters of fg and l , respectively .",
    "we shall use these eqs.- in our analysis of the related experimental ld s in section 4 . in the fitting procedure to the experimental data in the domain of discrete and resonance energies , the shift ( @xmath2 ) to the excitation energy @xmath3 , @xmath42",
    "is employed and the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are considered as adjustable parameters within the frame of eq . , while the spin cutoff parameters in the l and fg treatments are assumed as behaving either in the form of eq . or in the form of the so - called gc spin cutoff @xcite given by    @xmath43    unlike the ct approximation where the spin cutoff parameter is used as in ref.@xcite    @xmath44    in the next section(section 3 ) we study mass dependence of resonance ld parameter and excitation energy behavior of the ld of l theory in comparison with the same properties of other models .",
    "to predict the resonance ld parameters of different prescriptions used here , the observed s - wave neutron resonance ld(data , taken from @xcite ) , @xmath45 is fitted to the resonance ld model prescriptions @xmath46 , including equal parity distribution of the levels for the nucleus considered with the spins @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the target spin ) at the neutron binding energy .",
    "model resonance level density is expressed as    @xmath50\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cong & \\frac{(2i+1)}{2\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma^3}e^{-(i+1/2)^2/{2\\sigma^2}}\\operatorname{\\rho_{th}}(u)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that , @xmath51 is the average s - resonance spacing while @xmath23 , for calculation of this section is taken as in eq .. this expression form enables us to make a clear and reliable comparison considering our predictions on @xmath52 of l with those of fg , together with the additional model function    @xmath53    which is the version of fg model for the identical fermions(if ) , protons or neutrons @xcite .",
    ". has a different excitation energy dependence for the denominator comparing with denominators of eqs . and , which serves as a benchmark test of the present landau theory .",
    "@xmath54 parameters for ct model can be found by substituting eq . into the eq .. through this section , the nuclear excitation energy u is taken as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the sum of neutron and proton pairing energies taken from @xcite .    [ fig:1a ] [ fig:1b ]    .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    the findings of the calculations underlined for different nuclei are illustrated in table 1 and in figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "as can readily be seen from figs .",
    "1a and 1b considering all the model calculations , shell effects are explicitly appearing near the doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the resonance ld parameter values for fg and ip models are very close to each other , whereas the ld parameters obtained by the present l theory are systematically lower than those of two mentioned models .",
    "this effect is due to the energy dependencies of denominators of corresponding equations for the ld s . if this dependence express as @xmath57 , then @xmath58 for l , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 for ip and fg , respectively .",
    "slower energy dependence in denominator result smaller value of @xmath52 .",
    "clearly this feature must also appear in the fitting of the models to the corresponding experimental data including both the discrete energies and s - wave neutron excitations .",
    "the finding @xmath54 parameter values of ct model decrease versus the mass number of the compound nucleus however , indicating resonance increase near the double magic nuclei .",
    "in the present work , experimental data for the two sets of discrete level numbers are used in the fitting of model functions for ld s .",
    "the first set includes the level numbers indicated by the ripl-3 data sheet where energy levels up to maximum of the range are to be assumed as completely determined .",
    "this set of data are used in the fitting of discrete levels alone and also when discrete and resonance data are fitted with model ld s .",
    "the second set of the level numbers is taken from the systematic of the work in @xcite , where the less numbers of levels comparing with ripl-3 data are chosen .",
    "this data set for the discrete level numbers are used in the fitting procedure of discrete and resonance data with the model functions .",
    "the s - wave neutron resonance spacings are taken from ripl-3 data .",
    "we first approximate level number up to excitation energy @xmath3 in the discrete energy range by the use of formula    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the number of level corresponding to the level energy @xmath63 , @xmath64 for the ct approximation ( eq . ) , and @xmath65 for the fg and l ( eqs . and ) .",

    "table 2 illustrates the parameter values obtained in the discrete level number fitting procedure of the ct , fg and l to the ripl-3 data .",

    "the results finding may be classified as followings : ( a)the @xmath1 and @xmath41 parameter values for gc spin cutoff of both , l and fg , are systematically less than those for rb spin cutoff ( exception is the ^138^ba for the ripl-3 data range ) , ( b ) for the range of discrete energies from ref.@xcite the parameter values for ct and fg are close to those of finding in @xcite , ( c ) for the both discrete energy data range in refs.@xcite the ld parameter values of l and fg within the gc and rb spin cutoff s are close to each other , except for ^138^ba and ^166^ho , ( d)for the nuclei ^62^ni , ^76^as , ^166^ho , ^198^au in the range of discrete energies of work @xcite and for ^116^sn l theory better describes ( smaller values of @xmath73 ) observed data than that do ct and fg models .",

    "we have fitted the ld formulas of l , fg and ct with free level density and energy shift parameters for l and fg and , constant @xmath6 and energy shift parameters for ct to the experimental data for the nuclei ^60^co , ^62^ni , ^76^as , ^116^sn , ^138^ba , ^139^la , ^166^ho , ^198^au and ^233^th .",

    "the same observation appears when the discrete and resonance data are taken into account simultaneously with the systematic in @xcite .",
    "the present test results for the ripl-3 data range of discrete energies , however , indicate some advantages of the ct model in describing of ld s including s - wave neutron energy when compared to the others .",
    "the two spin cutoff parameters concerning with gc and rb spin cutoffs , have been used in the fitting procedures for fg and l. we have observed that the fits with gc spin cutoff parameters of l have better accuracy than those of rb .",
    "we have also calculated the @xmath52 parameter values of l and fg and , the @xmath54 parameter values of ct model for the @xmath84 nuclei by the fit of corresponding ld expressions to the observed s - wave neutron resonance ld s .",
    "the results observe resonance behaviors near the doubly magic nuclei .",
    "however , we note that the values of level density parameters ( @xmath41 ) of l calculated for all nuclei are systematically less than those of fg .",
    "clearly , such small values of @xmath41 of l theory lead to the decrease of ld s at higher excitations when compared to fg and ct calculations .",
    "the present landau model of nuclear ld s can not explicitly include different effects of nuclear structure such as shell , pairing and collective effects like fg and ct .",
    "nevertheless , gaining confidence form the successful applications of the present model in this article , it is worth to extend the present scenario to other nuclei .",
