    "note that at even times only the even sites can be occupied , while at odd times only the odd sites can be occupied .",
    "a continuum description of the random walk can be obtained when the lattice constant @xmath16 and the time step @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 converges to a finite value .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is called the diffusion coefficient and it quantifies the rate in which the random walker moves . in this limit",

    "this state is a superposition of all the basis states @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is the state in which the walker is located at site @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to the spatial degree of freedom the walker has a chirality qubit , which can be in a superposition of the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and determines the direction of the next hop .",

    "it was found that the quantum walk is highly sensitive to decoherence , namely , even weak decoherence gives rise to classical - like behavior in the long time limit .",

    "this interaction can be described by a variety of noise models , bringing the system into a mixed state , by essentially tracing out the environment degrees of freedom .",
    "a related problem is the effect of unitary noise , which appears as a result of fluctuations and drifts in the generating hamiltonian of any given unitary operation @xcite .",
