    "<S> scattering of particles produced in high energy nuclear collisions can wrestle the system into a state near local thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> i illustrate how measurements of the centrality dependence of the mean transverse momentum and its fluctuations can exhibit this thermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations of the net transverse momentum have recently been measured , with the star , phenix , na49 , and ceres experiments reporting substantial dynamic contributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such fluctuations can provide information on collision dynamics and , perhaps , the qcd phase transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary phenix and star data in au+au collisions show that @xmath0 fluctuations increase as centrality increases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , data from these same experiments exhibit a strikingly similar increase in the mean transverse momentum @xmath1 , a quantity unaffected by fluctuations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> i ask whether the approach to local thermal equilibrium can explain the similar centrality dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> my focus is on fluctuations , to develop the appropriate theoretical tools and experimental observables . </S>",
    "<S> dynamic fluctuations are characterized by the observable @xmath2 analyzed by star @xcite , where it is termed @xmath3 , and ceres @xcite . for particles of momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 , one defines @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the average over events , and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this definition exploits the relation of event - by - event fluctuations to inclusive correlation functions discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pair distribution is @xmath10 where @xmath11 for multiplicity @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> observe that ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) depends only on the two - body correlation function @xmath13 with @xmath14 , since the integral over @xmath15 vanishes due to the definition of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> alternative fluctuation observables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 proposed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite measure many - body correlations of all orders . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities are roughly equivalent @xmath20 when dynamic fluctuations are small compared to statistical fluctuations @xmath21 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> star measurements of @xmath0 fluctuations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ptfluct]a show an increase for low multiplicities corresponding to peripheral collisions at @xmath22  gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phenix measurements at 200  gev in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ptfluct]b also show such an increase for @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the increase appears to peak and possibly saturate for multiplicities corresponding to mid - peripheral impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the data may show a decrease for @xmath19 and @xmath18 for the most central collisions . while these measurements are preliminary and bear large uncertainties , this centrality dependence has already been attributed to phenomena associated with the qcd transition @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> i attribute the trend in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ptfluct ] to the onset of thermalization in increasingly central collisions , motivated by a similar behavior of the measured @xmath1 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phenix ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thermalization occurs as scattering between particles produced in the collision drives the system toward local thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the system is characterized by a phase space density @xmath23 that varies from collision event to event . </S>",
    "<S> as the system approaches local equilibrium the event - averaged @xmath24 tends toward the boltzmann - like distribution @xmath25 that varies in spacetime through the temperature @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> i show here that thermalization alters the average transverse momentum following @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability that a particle escapes the collision volume without scattering . </S>",
    "<S> dynamic fluctuations depend on two - body correlations and , correspondingly , are described by @xmath29 the initial quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 are determined by the particle production mechanism , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend on the state of the system near local equilibrium .    to understand how thermalization can cause the common trends in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ptfluct ] and [ fig : phenix ] , observe that as centrality is increased , the system lifetime increases , eventually to a point where local equilibrium is reached . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the survival probability @xmath28 in ( [ eq : meanpt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptfluct ] ) decreases from unity as the impact parameter decreases . both ( [ eq : meanpt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptfluct ] ) peak for impact parameters near the point where equilibrium is established . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior in collisions at centralities beyond that point depends on how subsequent hydrodynamic evolution changes @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the system size and lifetime increase . </S>",
    "<S> systems formed in the most central collisions can experience cooling that reduces ( [ eq : meanpt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptfluct ] ) .    for both the average @xmath0 and its fluctuations to _ increase _ during thermalization as in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ptfluct ] and [ fig : phenix ] , both @xmath32 and @xmath36 must exceed the initial values . </S>",
    "<S> for the average transverse momentum , this implies that the temperature @xmath37 at thermalization must be quite high , since @xmath38 . a value @xmath39  mev near that measured in pp collisions implies @xmath40  mev , suggesting that partons contribute to thermalization .    in the following paragraphs </S>",
    "<S> i estimate @xmath31 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> next , i formulate a nonequilibrium approach capable of treating fluctuations based on the boltzmann - langevin equation in the relaxation - time approximation . here , i sketch the derivation of ( [ eq : meanpt ] ) and ( [ eq : ptfluct ] ) , leaving the details for a longer paper .    </S>",
    "<S> transverse momentum and particle density fluctuations arise partly due to the particle production mechanism , e.g. , string fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations were measured in proton - proton ( pp ) collisions @xcite . to use these pp results to estimate @xmath42 for nuclear collisions , i apply the wounded nucleon model to describe the soft production that dominates @xmath1 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the charged particle multiplicity @xmath12 and other extensive quantities are assumed to scale linearly with the number of participant nucleons @xmath44 , while the intensive one - body observable @xmath1 is independent of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> centrality is determined by @xmath45 for impact parameter @xmath46 , averaged over collision geometry .    to estimate the initial @xmath47 using the wounded nucleon model , </S>",
    "<S> i follow the appendix in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to obtain @xmath48 the term outside the parentheses is expected because ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) measures relative fluctuations and , therefore , should scale as @xmath49 ; note that pp collisions have two participants . </S>",
    "<S> the term in parentheses accounts for the normalization of ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) to @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 . from @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the robust variance @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 and scales as @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> isr measurements imply @xmath55 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hijing gives @xmath56 and @xmath57 for central au+au for the rapidity interval @xmath58 studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to compare ( [ eq : wnm ] ) to @xmath59 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ptfluct]a , i assume central collisions produce @xmath60 charged particles in @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 .    near local thermal equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> dynamic fluctuations occur because initial state fluctuations result in transient spatial inhomogeneity that can survive thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneity would eventually disappear due to diffusion and viscosity , but can be observed if freeze out is sufficiently rapid . </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneity is essential for dynamic fluctuations , since @xmath63 and @xmath17 would otherwise vanish for @xmath64 .    to see how inhomogeneity can survive thermalization , </S>",
    "<S> observe that local equilibrium is achieved when the average phase space distribution of particles within a small fluid cell @xmath65 relaxes to the local equilibrium form @xmath66 . the time scale for this process is the relaxation time @xmath67 discussed later . in contrast , density differences _ between _ cells must be dispersed by transport from cell to cell . </S>",
    "<S> the time needed for diffusion to disperse a dense fluid mass of size @xmath68 is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the thermal speed of particles . </S>",
    "<S> this time can be much larger than @xmath67 for a sufficiently large fluid mass . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid expansion of the collision system further prevents inhomogeneity from being dispersed prior to freeze out .    </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneity produces spatial correlations : it is more likely to find particles together near a dense fluid mass . </S>",
    "<S> these spatial correlations entirely determine the phase - space correlations when the momentum distribution at each point is thermal . </S>",
    "<S> i write @xmath71 evaluated at the freeze out proper time @xmath72 , where the phase - space correlation function is @xmath73 for @xmath74 . a small change in density </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 will initially drive the system from equilibrium by an amount @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding phase space correlations are described near equilibrium by @xmath77 where the spatial correlation function is @xmath78 the form ( [ eq : localeqcorr ] ) ensures that both @xmath79 and @xmath80 vanish in global equilibrium , where particle number fluctuations obey poisson statistics . </S>",
    "<S> i use ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) and ( [ eq : ptrho1])([eq : variance ] ) to find @xmath81 where the local transverse momentum excess , @xmath82 , vanishes if the collision volume is uniform .    to estimate @xmath35 using ( [ eq : ptrho3 ] ) , i assume that bjorken scaling holds and that longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom are independent . </S>",
    "<S> i then write the transverse coordinate dependence of ( [ eq : variance ] ) as @xmath83 where the density is @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> i parameterize @xmath85 and @xmath86 to be gaussian with r.m.s .  </S>",
    "<S> widths @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively the transverse radius and correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum excess @xmath89 in ( [ eq : ptrho3 ] ) depends on the temperature profile of the system , since @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath91 , for the density - weighted average @xmath92 , so that @xmath93.\\ ] ] i parameterize @xmath94 as gaussian of width @xmath95 and use @xmath96 to fix @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic @xmath0 fluctuations near local equilibrium then satisfy @xmath98 where @xmath52 is given by ( [ eq : raa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath99 is dimensionless and depends on the ratio of the correlation length @xmath100 to the transverse size @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> i use ( [ eq : corrparam ] ) and ( [ eq : momparam ] ) to compute @xmath101[\\hat{t}(\\mathbf{r}_{t2 } ) - 1]\\|,\\ ] ] a double density - weighted average over @xmath102 and @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> i find @xmath104 for @xmath105 . to determine ( [ eq : near ] ) for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ptfluct]a , i take @xmath106 and @xmath60 as before . </S>",
    "<S> i emphasize that the hijing @xmath52 value builds in fluctuations from resonance decay and , moreover , is roughly consistent with measured net charge fluctuations @xcite .     </S>",
