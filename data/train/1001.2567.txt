    "one of the most important questions facing models of galaxy evolution today is how central supermassive black holes , found at the centers of most galaxies , co - evolve with their host galaxies . the observed correlations between central black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion in present epoch galaxies ( @xmath4 , gebhardt et  al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merrit 2000 ; tremaine et  al .",
    "2002 ) and between black hole mass and galaxy bulge mass or bulge luminosity ( @xmath5 ; magorrian et  al .  1998",
    "; hring & rix 2004 ) provide striking evidence for this coevolution",
    ". however , the shapes of these correlations , particularly at the extremes of velocity dispersion or luminosity , are not well known , and , which , if either , of these correlations is a reliable predictor of black hole mass in galaxies with high central stellar velocity dispersion or large luminosity remains controversial ( lauer et  al .",
    "key to resolving this controversy is understanding the dynamical connections between galaxy interactions , the feedback cycle from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and black hole fueling and growth .",
    "recent observations show that galaxy evolution occurs predominantly in moderately massive galaxy groups at redshifts @xmath6 ( cooper et  al .",
    "thus to build dynamical models for the transformation of galaxies and the growth of their central black holes , we must understand how galaxy interactions and feedback affect gas in and surrounding galaxies in the group environment .",
    "questions that remain poorly understood include : what dynamical processes control the mass and energy flows into or out of the merging galaxies either fueling the central agn and/or initiating star formation , or quenching star formation and heating and enriching the intragroup medium ( igm ) ?",
    "when and how are the dark matter and hot gas halos of the merging galaxy separated from the galaxy to become part of the group gravitational potential ?",
    "how efficiently are the outer stellar halos of interacting galaxies stripped ?",
    "are central stellar velocity dispersions of the galaxies affected by these interactions and on what dynamical timescales ?",
    "what role do non - hydrostatic group gas ( igm ) motions , induced by galaxies and galaxy subgroups passing through the group core , play in the co - evolution of the system ?    merging galaxies in nearby galaxy groups are particularly important laboratories in which to address these questions , since only in these groups",
    "do x - ray observations have sufficient angular resolution to directly observe the x - ray edges , outflows , cavities , shocks , ripples and tails characteristic of the dynamical processes at work on the galaxies and within the group .",
    "measurements of temperatures and densities in these features allow us to constrain the velocities , orbits and interaction history of the galaxies , as well as probe the cycle of nuclear activity that transports matter and energy between the galaxy s nucleus and the surrounding gas .",
    "modeling the effects of these interactions on nearby galaxies , that lie on the extremes of the black hole mass scaling relations , provides a unique opportunity to understand the galactic processes that determine the shape and validity of these relations .        in this paper",

    "a possible explanation for these dust features and unusual stellar kinematics is that ngc6868 has recently captured a dust rich companion .",
    "such a cold gas rich merger could fuel agn activity and/or black hole growth ( hardcastle et  al .",

    "the measured central gas velocity for ngc6861 is among the highest in their samples , comparable or exceeding that found in ngc4486 ( m87 ) .",

    "alternatively , the high central gas velocity dispersion in ngc6861 could be caused , in part , by the input of kinetic energy into the gas from the central agn through outflows or turbulence ( verdoes kleijn et  al .",
    "2006 ; capellari et  al .",
    "2000 ) . then the mass of the central black hole needed to explain the high central gas velocities could be smaller , falling below the @xmath21 prediction and closer to that of the magorrian relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : magorrian ] ) . ngc6861 does host a weak radio source , with core radio power , measured with the australian telescope , of @xmath47mjy at @xmath32ghz ( slee et  al .  1994 ) .",
    "the radio source is extended with a core - to - total radio power ratio of @xmath48 .",
    "although there is no evidence for large scale radio jets , the @xmath49 ( @xmath50kpc ) angular resolution of the australian telescope does not rule out substructure on scales of a few tens of parsecs nor preclude feedback from previous episodes of agn activity , each of which might heat the central interstellar medium ( ism ) , lowering the black hole mass required to model the central gas velocity dispersions observed with stis . finally , the stellar velocity dispersion of ngc6861 could be anomalously high due to gravitational interactions with ngc6868 or other group galaxies . in these latter two cases , the puzzle is then what interaction history could cause such a high stellar velocity dispersion for ngc6861 , while not producing obviously unrelaxed stellar kinematics that would have excluded the galaxy from the beifiori et  al .",

    "modest density jumps and subsonic relative velocities , as observed for ngc6868 , are also characteristic of gas ` sloshing ' , where the surrounding igm has been set in motion by the gravitational perturbation of a prior passage of galaxies or galaxy subgroups past each other in the group core ( markevitch et  al .",
    "simulations of sloshing in subcluster mergers show that the signatures of sloshing are most pronounced in the temperature structure of the gas , often producing cool , spiral - shaped tail - like features , as higher entropy gas from larger radii is mixed with the nearby lower entropy galaxy and subgroup gas ( ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ) .",

    "deeper observations are required to disentangle the complex temperature structure to the east of ngc6861 .      since bifurcated tails",
    "are common features in ram - pressure stripped galaxies , such as those infalling into the virgo cluster ( see , e.g. randall et  al .",

    "long , hot tails can be formed by turbulent - viscous stripping of galaxy gas and its subsequent mixing and thermalization with the group igm during supersonic motion of the galaxy through the ambient group gas , or by gravitational focusing of the igm into an adiabatically heated bondi - hoyle wake ( see , e.g. machacek et  al .",
    "however , when such supersonic infall occurs in the plane of the sky , as we expect here ( see  [ sec : merger ] ) , we should see a rise in temperature and density along a narrow shock front preceding the motion , followed by a cold front edge closer to the galaxy .",

    "if the factor @xmath242 temperature rise in the sheath is due to a shock , we would expect to see a corresponding factor @xmath163 increase in density from the rankine - hugoniot conditions and , thus , a surface brightness increase by a factor @xmath243 in the same region ( see , e.g. landau & lifshitz 1959 ) .",
    "although we find no evidence in these data for the sharp change in surface brightness ( and thus density ) that would be associated with such a shock , nor do we see the associated merger cold front expected if ngc6861 were moving supersonically in the plane of the sky through the ambient igm , projection effects in these sparse data may make such features difficult to observe .",
    "a more promising scenario may be that surface brightness and temperature asymmetries are the result of a gravitational encounter between ngc6868 and ngc6861 , each the dominant galaxy in their own subgroup .",
    "then the dark matter distribution is bimodal , with each galaxy residing near its own local minimum of the gravitational potential .",
    "this would explain why double @xmath0-models provide a good description of the mean surface brightness profile around each galaxy .",
    "however , since the merger is likely occuring in the plane of the sky , this subgroup structure may be difficult to discern from the optical galaxy distributions .",
    "we may be viewing the encounter after the subgroups have passed through pericenter , but before the gas halos have been completely stripped and merged .",
    "the strong temperature and surface brightness asymmetries around each of the merging partners may be due to non - hydostatic motions of the gas ( ` sloshing ' ) , as gas is displaced from the center of each subcluster s dark matter potential , similar to those produced in simulations of premerger encounters of more massive subcluster halos .",
    "when gas is present in both halos , cold fronts with cool spiral - shaped tails may form about one subcluster , while higher temperature shock - heated features may form around the other ( see figure 9 of ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ) .",

    "thus the observation of sloshing signatures around each galaxy , even though they are separated by @xmath244kpc ( sound crossing time of @xmath198myr ) , is reasonable .",

    "for the northwestern bubble these imply bubble ages of @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275myr , respectively , for the three methods , and a mechanical luminosity of @xmath276ergs@xmath18 .",
    "bubble ages of @xmath277yr are typical for ghost bubbles in other systems ( see , e.g. birzan et  al .",
    "2004 ) .    a partially rimmed , spherical x - ray surface brightness feature , with radius @xmath278 may also be seen in figure [ fig : chandramosaic ] located @xmath279 to the southwest of ngc6868 s nucleus . a filament of hot gas ( region f in fig .",
    "[ fig : fepeaktmap ] ) is seen to cross the candidate cavity .",
    "if this feature is also a buoyant ghost bubble , perhaps broken by the hydrodynamic motions in the gas caused by interactions between ngc6868 and ngc6861 , we estimate its enthalpy , age and mechanical power to be @xmath280ergs , @xmath281myr , and @xmath282ergs@xmath18 , respectively , comparable to that of the northwest cavity .",
    "the surface brightness in the plume rising to the northeast from ngc6861 and in the western tail increase by factors @xmath283 and @xmath284 , compared to regions to the southeast at comparable distance from ngc6861 s nucleus , and have a @xmath285kev higher temperature than the central region of that galaxy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fepeaktmap ] and regions fa and wt compared to g in table [ tab : n6861specfits ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that gas in these regions may have been disturbed and heated by agn activity . assuming that the western tail is contained in a cylindrical volume oriented in the plane of the sky with radius @xmath286kpc and length @xmath287kpc ( based on the wt spectral region )",
    ", we find the tail contains @xmath288 of hot gas .",
    "since the gas in the tail appears clumpy , the filling factor @xmath289 is likely less than one , so that this is an upper bound on the actual mass of hot gas in the tail .",
    "the energy necessary to raise the temperature of the gas in the tail from @xmath290kev found for gas in the bright central region of the galaxy ( region g ) or the surrounding igm to @xmath291kev measured in the tail is @xmath292ergs .",
    "outburst energies of up to @xmath293ergs have been measured from shocks observed in , for example , hercules a ( nulsen et  al .",
    "2005a ) and hydra a ( nulsen et  al .",
    "2005b ) , while outburst energies @xmath294ergs have been measured in m87 ( forman et  al .",
    "2005 ) , whose @xmath295 central black hole has mass comparable to that inferred for ngc6861 from the @xmath296 relation .",
    "thus energetic outbursts from a @xmath297 black hole at the center of ngc6861 would have sufficient energy to heat and produce turbulent motions in the gas , that might also contribute to the disturbed gas morphology observed near ngc6861 .",
    "the discrepancy between the black hole mass prediction from the magorrian relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : magorrian ] ) and the @xmath296 relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : mbhsigma ] ) is still difficult to understand . if ngc6861 s black hole mass is large , then either an existing massive stellar bulge has been stripped from ngc6861 or the coevolution of ngc6861 s stellar bulge has been inhibited or delayed during a period of rapid black hole growth . in the first case ,",
    "hydrodynamic processes such as ram pressure and turbulent viscous stripping , plasma outflows from agn , or gas sloshing may heat and redistribute the gas in and around ngc6861 , but would be ineffective at changing the galaxy s stellar distribution .",
    "stars in the outer halo could be stripped tidally if the impact parameter of the collision between ngc6861 with ngc6868 is sufficiently small , as observed in dumbbell galaxy systems such as ngc4782/ngc4783 .",
    "however , even in the deeply penetrating collisions of such dumbbell galaxies , simulations show that only @xmath298 of the stellar mass is expected to be stripped ( madejsky & bien 1993 ) . for a @xmath297 black hole , equation",
    "[ eq : magorrian ] predicts a stellar bulge mass for ngc6861 of @xmath299 , such that previous interactions would have had to strip @xmath300 of the stellar mass to be in agreement with the k - band mass estimates given in table [ tab : bhmass ] .",
    "one would expect to see evidence for such cataclysmic tidal disruption in tidal bridges , tails or other stellar morphological distortions , that are not observed in the stellar distributions of either ngc6861 or ngc6868 .",
    "also this scenario would imply the direct passage of the subgroup gas cores through each other and much more disruption in the x - ray gas in ngc6868 than is observed .",
    "the second case , in which the growth of the stellar bulge is inhibited , may be more likely .",
    "ngc6861 shows evidence for a stellar bar ( koprolin & zeilinger 2000 ) .",
    "stellar bars are likely to be formed in mergers and allow angular momentum of infalling matter to be dissipated . gas and dust",
    "may then be transported along the bar to the galaxy s nuclear region to fuel one or several episodes of rapid black hole growth .",
    "if this accretion event triggers an agn outburst in ngc6861 , gas otherwise available for star formation could be heated and inflated , delaying the expected growth of the bulge ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "the total energy deposited into the ambient gas from an episode of rapid black hole growth is @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is the rest mass energy of the accreted matter , @xmath303 is the fraction of the rest mass energy released in the accretion event , and @xmath304 , the feedback efficiency , measures how efficiently that energy is coupled to the surrounding galaxy and subgroup gas . for the standard assumption of radiative efficient accretion ( @xmath305 ) and efficient feedback @xmath306 ( di matteo et  al .  2008 ;",
    "churazov et  al .",
    "2002 ) , the total energy deposited in the surrounding gas as the black hole grows from @xmath41 predicted by the margorrian relation to @xmath307 , consistent with the @xmath296 relation , would be large ( @xmath308ergs ) .",
    "this is comparable to the most energetic agn outbursts observed in massive clusters ( see , e.g. nulsen et  al .",
    "2005a for hercules a ; mcnamara et  al .",
    "2002 for ms 0735.6 + 7421 ; nulsen et  al .",
    "2005b for hydra a ) .",
    "if accretion proceeds at the eddington rate , @xmath309 the accretion timescale would be @xmath310myr and the mean radiative power , @xmath311ergs@xmath18 .",
    "the power that couples to the surrounding gas ( @xmath312ergs@xmath18 ) is more than three orders of magnitude larger than that needed to balance x - ray cooling in the galaxy .",
    "such an event would likely completely disrupt the gas in ngc6861 and its subgroup .",
    "however the accretion and feedback efficiencies are highly uncertain .",
    "if the growth of ngc6861 s black hole was triggered by the ongoing merger with the ngc6868 subgroup in as0851 , either the accretion is radiatively inefficient ( @xmath313 ) , the released rest - mass energy is only weakly coupled to the galaxy and subgroup gas ( @xmath314 ; see , e.g. , kurosawa et  al .",
    "2009 ) , and/or the black hole grows through multiple , less energetic outburst events over a much longer timescale .",
    "for example , if @xmath315 , the energy from agn activity deposited in the surrounding subgroup gas from this episode of rapid black hole growth would be @xmath294ergs , sufficient to heat the western tail . alternatively , the period of rapid black hole growth may have occurred at very early times , before ngc6861 was assembled into the current galaxy group / subgroup structures in as0851 .",
    "then a very strong agn outburst , as indicated above , may have swept gas from the galaxy , delaying bulge formation by quenching star formation and heating or blowing away any surrounding subgroup gas .",
    "growth of the associated stellar bulge for ngc6861 may only now be occurring , not through star formation , but by the cannibalizaton of the stellar distributions already in place as ngc6861 merges with nearby galaxies in the group and ultimately ngc6868 ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "a third possibility is that the magorrian relation holds and the central black hole in ngc6861 is @xmath316 , typical for early type galaxies in groups",
    ". then gravitational interactions between ngc6861 and ngc6868 or other group galaxies would also need to increase the central stellar velocity dispersion in ngc6861 to anomalously high values .",
    "strong tidal forces in a deeply penetrating encounter may distort stellar velocity profiles , causing them to increase with distance from the galaxy center ( see , e.g. madejsky & bien 1993 for ngc4782 ) . for finite apertures",
    ", this might contaminate the measurement of the central stellar velocity dispersion and thus cause the black hole mass to be overestimated .",
    "for example , the measurement of @xmath317kms@xmath18by koprolin & zeilinger ( 2000 ) is the average stellar velocity dispersion within @xmath318 ( @xmath319pc ) of the galactic center , well outside the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole .",
    "however , if the velocity dispersion profile has been affected by tidal forces in a merger , as in ngc4782 , one would expect that the stellar velocity dispersion would increase when averaged over larger radii , which is not observed in ngc6861 ( koprolin & zeilinger 2000 ) .",
    "it is also difficult to understand in this scenario why the stellar velocity dispersion of ngc6861 would be so profoundly affected by the interaction , while that of its likely interacting partner ngc6868 is not .",
    "if the magorrian relation holds , the anomalously high stellar velocity dispersion in ngc6861 may require ngc6861 to have experienced one or more recent minor mergers unrelated to the interaction with ngc6868 that is responsible for the large scale gas sloshing observed in the group .",
    "in this paper we used _",
    "chandra _ observations of ngc6868 and ngc6861 in the as0851 galaxy group to measure the density and temperature structure of gas in these two dominant group elliptical galaxies .",
    "this system is particularly important because , although the brightest group galaxy has a black hole mass @xmath320 predicted by the @xmath296 relation , that is both consistent with the margorrian @xmath321 relation and typical of black hole masses inferred for the dominant galaxies in other cool groups , the central black hole mass inferred from the @xmath296 relation for the second brightest group galaxy ngc6861 ( @xmath322 ) is more than an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by the magorrian relation .",
    "the goal of this work was to use these x - ray data to explore possible interaction scenarios ( infall and gas stripping , gas sloshing , agn outburst activity ) that might affect galaxy evolution and black hole growth .      *",
    "the x - ray surface brightness distributions around ngc6868 and ngc6861 are each well described by double @xmath0-models with inner ( outer ) beta and core radii of @xmath323 and @xmath324kpc ( @xmath325 and @xmath326kpc ) for ngc6868 and @xmath101 and @xmath102kpc ( @xmath103 and @xmath104kpc ) for ngc6861 .",
    "this suggests that ngc6868 and ngc6861 may each be the dominant galaxy in a galaxy subgroup that is merging .",
    "lack of evidence for substructure in the galaxy reshift distribution suggests that we would be viewing such a subgroup merger close to the plane of the sky . *",
    "x - ray surface brightness and temperature maps of ngc6868 show a cold front @xmath327kpc to the north of the galaxy nucleus and a spiral - shaped tail of cool @xmath2kev gas to the south , suggesting relative motion between the galaxy and the surrounding igm .",
    "analysis of the density and temperature across the edge constrains the relative motion between ngc6868 and the igm to be at most transonic ( @xmath328kms@xmath18 ) .",
    "while we can not rule out the possibility that the tail is composed of ram - pressure stripped galaxy gas , the tightly wound spiral - like morphology of the tail in the temperature map strongly suggests that that the tail is a result of the ` sloshing ' of gas in the gravitational potential , set in motion by the previous gravitational encounter between the ngc6868 and ngc6861 subgroups . *",
    "x - ray surface brightness and temperature maps for ngc6861 , @xmath329kpc to the west of ngc6868 , show a complex morphology also suggestive of a subgroup merger . while spectra of the central @xmath160kpc of ngc6861 containing the bright stellar disk is well described by a cool @xmath226kev thermal plasma model plus a power law with photon index @xmath330 for the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , the temperature of gas in the @xmath331kpc ` sheath ' outside ngc6861 s central region is a factor @xmath163 higher . a hot ( @xmath332kev ) , bifurcated tail",
    "is seen trailing ngc6861 @xmath333kpc to the west and northwest .",
    "these features may suggest that the ngc6861 subgroup is undergoing ram - pressure or turbulent - viscous stripping during supersonic infall towards ngc6868 .",
    "however , comparing the density and temperature morphologies of ngc6868 and ngc6861 taken together with simulations from the literature , the more likely explanation is that the hot features in ngc6861 are the consequence of gas sloshing caused by the ongoing merger of two subgroups , whose respective hot gas halos have not yet been stripped .",
    "* ngc6868 may have undergone a period of merger - induced agn activity .",
    "x - ray surface brightness images show weak evidence for roughly circular surface brightness deficits to the northwest and southwest of ngc6868 .",
    "if confirmed in deeper x - ray images or low frequency radio observations to be buoyant bubbles filled with relativistic plasma from previous agn activity , the bubbles enthalpies ( @xmath334ergs ) , mechanical power ( @xmath335ergs@xmath18 ) and ages ( @xmath336myr ) are typical for ` ghost ' cavities observed in other systems .",
    "while the x - ray data favor a sloshing interaction scenario aided by agn activity to explain possible cavities near ngc6868 and gas heating in / near ngc6861 , an explanation for the discrepancy between the magorrian and @xmath296 relation predictions for the black hole mass at the center of ngc6861 remains challenging .",
    "deeper x - ray observations that probe closer to the central engine and map with greater precision the complex density and temperature structure of the gas are needed to constrain the gasdynamics and orbital parameters of the merger and determine the energies and timescales of associated agn activity .",
    "more detailed theoretical modeling in gravity + hydrodynamic numerical simulations that are guided by those data may then be able to determine how mergers affect the high mass end of the black hole mass relations and solve the mystery of ngc6861 s black hole mass .",
