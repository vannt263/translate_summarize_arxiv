    "to achieve a fully covariant description of two - fermion systems , directly in minkowski space , represents a challenging issue , that nowadays can be considered quite conceivable at least for analytic interaction kernels . as a matter of fact",
    ", the description can be carried out within the non perturbative framework given by the bethe - salpeter equation(bse ) @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a wide introduction ) and exploiting new approaches based on i ) the so - called nakanishi integral representation ( nir ) @xcite of the bs amplitude ( bsa ) and ii ) the light - front ( lf ) machinery .",
    "for instance , to work directly in the lf environment has a clear advantage in hadron physics , since one is immediately ready to calculate the relevant lf momentum distributions to be adopted in the investigation of several processes .",
    "however , it is worth reminding that to determine from the bsa , directly in minkowski space , the lf momentum distributions ( indeed , to be used in many areas , besides hadron physics ) is the holy grail for both fundamental approaches , like the lattice calculations ( though in euclidean space ) and phenomenological studies .",
    "as it is well - known , the fermionic nature of the interacting constituents produces difficulties that are far from trivial , but in our approach , where the nir plays a pivotal role in the elaboration of the strategy for getting actual solutions of bse , can be put under control .",
    "we briefly recall the main path to bse ( for an extended review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , simplifying to the case of two scalars .",
    "one has to start with the 4-point green s function , given by g(x_1,x_2;y_1,y_2)=<0| t\\{_1(x_1)_2(x_2)_1^+(y_1 ) _",
    "2^+(y_2)}|0 >  .",
    "it fulfills an integral equation ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) that symbolically reads as follows g = g_0  +  g_0   i  g [ g4ie ]        where @xmath0 is the interaction kernel given by the infinite sum of irreducible feynman graphs . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] some examples are given for the simple case of a @xmath1 theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the caveats about such a model ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the iteration of the integral equation gives all the expected contributions .",
    "if one inserts a complete fock basis in @xmath2 , then the bound state contribution ( assuming only one non degenerate bound state for the sake of simplicity ) appears as a pole in the fourier space , i.e. g_b(k , q;p_b , )   where @xmath3 is the set of possible quantum numbers , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is bsa for a bound state , in momentum space . in configuration space ,",
    "the bsa reads @xmath6 the 4-point green s function can be approximated by @xmath7 and one gets the homogeneous bse , that holds for a bound state . in conclusion , the integral equation determining the bsa for a bound system , without self - energy and vertex corrections to be simply , is given by ( k;p_b,)= g_0(k;p_b , )  d^4q   i(k , q;p_b )  ( q;p_b , ) where for a two - scalar system the two - body free - propagator is g_0=   notably , @xmath8 , the irreducible kernel in bse , is the same one meets in the integral equation for the 4-point green s function ( cf eq . ) .",
    "in the sixties , nakanishi @xcite proposed an integral representation for @xmath9-leg transition amplitudes , based on the parametric formula of the feynman diagrams .    -leg transition amplitude .",
    "notice that the legs can correspond to on - mass - shell particles or to off - mass - shell ones , depending on the actual process under scrutiny . ]    in a scalar theory , for @xmath9 external legs , a generic contribution to the transition amplitude is given by ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) f _ g_nk(p_1,p_2, ... ,p_n )  _ r=1^kd^4q_r   where @xmath10 propagators and @xmath11 loops are present .",
    "( @xmath11 is the number of integration variables ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the external momenta are @xmath9 and does not change from one diagram to another , all belonging to the infinite set contributing to the given process one is investigating .",
    "nakanishi proposed a compact and elegant expression for the full @xmath9-leg amplitude @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the set of all the independent scalar products one can construct from the @xmath9 external momenta .",
    "the main ingredient for obtaining the nakanishi integral representation , once the feynman parametric representation for the amplitudes is adopted , is the following identity 1_h _ 0 ^ 1dz_h ( z_h- ) _ 0^d  ( -_l ) where @xmath14 are suitable combinations of the feynman parameters @xmath15 , and @xmath16 @xcite . by integrating by parts @xmath17 times",
    "one gets f_g_nk(s )  _ h_0 ^",
    "1dz_h_0^ d [ nir0]where @xmath18 is a proper function ( indeed a distribution ) . by adopting the nakanishi change of variables",
    "one is able to move the dependence upon the details of the diagram , i.e. @xmath19 , from the denominator to the numerator .",
    "more notably , after performing the change of variables any diagram @xmath20 leads to a contribution @xmath21 with just the same formal expression for the denominator , as given in eq . .",
    "eventually , this allows one to formally carry on the sum over the infinite set of feynman diagrams contributing to a given @xmath9-leg transition amplitude @xmath22 .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the full @xmath9-leg transition amplitude can be formally written as f^n(s )  = _",
    "g_nk   f_g_nk(s )  _ h_0 ^ 1dz_h _ 0^ d where @xmath23 , is called the nakanishi weight function for the @xmath9-leg transition amplitude .",
    "such an elegant expression can be exploited for obtaining the @xmath24-leg transition amplitude or vertex function , that will be the main quantity to be tentatively adopted within the bs framework for describing a two - body interacting system , as discussed in what follows .",
    "the vertex function reads f_3(s)=_0 ^ 1 dz _ 0^d [ vertex1]with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "notice that only three independent scalar products can be constructed from the 4-momenta at disposal . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , it is pictorially shown the bsa , that can be obtained from @xmath27 after multiplying the external legs ( off - mass - shell ) by the corresponding propagators .",
    "an on - mass - shell 4-momentum . ]",
    "we should anticipate that the application of the nir of the vertex function to the bs framework is only formal .",
    "let us clarify the meaning of this statement , that allows one to better understand the spirit of extending nir , elaborated within a perturbative framework , such as the one based on feynman diagrams , to a non perturbative regime , that is compelling for a realistic description of an interacting system ( in a bound or scattering states ) . as shown in eq .",
    ", the denominator contains the analytic structure of the amplitude and the numerator is a quantity that in principle one can obtain once a perturbation theory is considered , i.e. when a scattering process is described perturbatively .",
    "one can tentatively assume the formal expression is valid also in a non perturbative regime , but taking as arbitrary the function in the numerator and keeping the same analytical structure in the denominator , i.e. the one determined by all the independent scalar products composed by the external 4-momenta . to construct the bsa from eq .",
    "one can simply multiply by the constituent propagators .",
    "this step preserves the overall analytic structure shown in eq .",
    "( the external momenta do not change ! ) but change the power of the denominator ( see next section ) .    summarizing : for positive energies of the system , one gets perturbatively the expression , and assumes that the analytic structure is the same also for a non perturbative scenario , planning to exploit the freedom associated to the numerator .",
    "this is taken as an arbitrary function , once we move from the perturbative framework to the non perturbative one . in spirit",
    ", this strategy could resemble the familiar steps one carries on when the harmonic oscillator eigen - problem is solved .",
    "first one determines the asymptotic behavior of the solutions and then , one realizes that in order to solve the eigenvalue problem it is necessary the presence of the hermite polynomials .",
    "similar steps are followed for actually solving bse once the nir of the bsa is introduced .",
    "noteworthy , elaborating the nakanishi arguments @xcite , one can always assume nir for the bsa if the interaction kernel in bse is analytical .",
    "the homogeneous bse for two scalars has been numerically solved within nir framework in ref .",
    "@xcite ( an early application via the uniqueness theorem of the nakanishi weight function @xcite ) and in refs .",
    "it should be pointed out that also the inhomogeneous bse , suitable for investigating the scattering states , can be studied by using the nir framework @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the appealing feature of nir is the explicit appearance of the analytic structure of the vertex function and the presence of some _ hidden _ freedom , once the weight function is taken as an unknown quantity within a non perturbative context , i.e the bse in minkowski space .",
    "the basic question to be answered is : do actual solutions of the bse have the analytic structure exposed by nir ? in what follows , it will be sketched how to reach a quantitative answer to the previous question by exploiting the lf framework ( for more details , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if one inserts the nir of the bsa in the homogeneous bse , one can perform the needed analytic integration obtaining an eigen - equation for the unknown weight function ( indeed one gets a generalized eigenvalue problem ) .",
    "it is the integration on the lf variable @xmath29 , also known as lf projection ( see ref . @xcite and references quoted therein for a short review of the issue ) , that allows one to reduce the complexity of the 4d bse .",
    "let us illustrate the issue in the simple case of two massive scalars interacting through the exchange of a massive scalar in ladder approximation , within the non explicitly covariant lf framework @xcite ( for the treatment within the explicitly covariant lf framework see refs .",
    "first one assumes a nir for the bsa , viz _",
    "b(k , p)= _ 0^d_-1 ^ 1 dz  g_b(,z,;^2 ) ^3 [ nir1]where @xmath30 is the nakanishi weight function , to be determined , @xmath31 is the 4-momentum of the interacting system and @xmath32 yields the strength of the binding , since @xmath33 is the mass of the constituents and @xmath34 with @xmath35 binding energy .",
    "the _ valence component _ of the fock expansion of the two - scalar interacting state is readily obtained by integrating on @xmath29 the bsa , @xmath36 , and reads _",

    "b(k , p)=g_0(k , p )   d^4 k  k_bs(k , k,p )  _ b(k,p ) [ bse ] one gets @xcite _ 0^d = _ 0^d_-1 ^ 1dz  v^lf_b(,z;,z ) g_b(,z;^2 ) .",
    "[ nak1]with @xmath39 a new kernel , fully determined by the irreducible kernel @xmath40 present in bse , . the explicit form for the nakanishi kernel @xmath41 in ladder approximation can be found in @xcite and in @xcite , while ref .",
    "@xcite presents the cross - ladder case .    in conclusion",
    ", once we know an explicit form of the 4d kernel in bse , , then we can obtain a generalized eigenvalue problem for determining the nakanishi weight function @xmath42 , as given by eq . .",
    "if solutions exist , this indicate that solutions of the bse in minkowski space can be written as a nir .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same approach has been applied to excited states @xcite , allowing the calculation of the valence momentum distributions for those states , and also to the evaluation of scattering lengths @xcite , i.e. a first insight in the continuum .",
    "to introduce spin degrees of freedom in the bse is a non trivial task , and one has to carefully elaborate the treatment for getting reliable solutions @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of the presence of further degrees of freedom is the need of decomposing the bsa in a suitable sum of dirac structures multiplied by unknown scalar functions , that depend upon the external 4 momenta .",
    "notice that the number of allowed dirac structures is constrained by parity , total spin and the proper behavior of the bsa under lorentz transformations",
    ". a first big difference between a two - fermion interacting system ( but also for a fermion - boson or vector - vector cases ) and a two - scalar one is the increasing of the number of scalar functions determining the bsa , and consequently the number of nakanishi weight functions . as a matter of fact ,",
    "each scalar function that is present in the _ macroscopical _ expansion of the bsa can be written in terms of a nir , generalizing the two - scalar case .",
    "the first case that has been investigated is a @xmath43 two - fermion system @xcite .",
    "the corresponding bsa contains four scalar functions and can be written as follows ( k , p)= s_1  _ 1(k , p)+s_2  _ 2(k , p)+s_3  _ 3(k , p ) + s_4  _ 4(k , p ) [ bse2 ] where @xmath44 are the four dirac structures compatible with the quantum numbers of the @xmath43 state . for a @xmath45 state",
    "the number of @xmath44 doubles .",
    "indeed there is some freedom in the actual choice of the @xmath46 @xmath44 matrices , but it is convenient @xcite to implement an orthogonality relation between them . in particular , one can choose @xmath44 such that @xmath47 .",
    "hence , one gets s_1 = _ 5  , s_2 = / pm  _ 5  , s_3 = k p m^3 / p  _ 5 - 1",
