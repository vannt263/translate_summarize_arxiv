    "the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite is usually investigated in terms of abelian gauge theories , _ e.g. _ electromagnetism formulated via maxwell s equations .",
    "further , the electromagnetic fields considered in the canonical aharonov - bohm effect are static fields . for the vector / magnetic aharonov - bohm effect",
    ", this means a static vector potential , @xmath0 , which then translates to a static magnetic field via @xmath1 . in this article , we wish to consider the aharonov - bohm effect in the presence of _ time - dependent , non - abelian _ gauge fields .",
    "there has been some prior work on the aharonov - bohm effect in the presence of time - independent , non - abelian fields @xcite . unlike the abelian case of electromagnetism",
    ", it may not be possible to observe the aharonov - bohm effect for static , non - abelian fields .",
    "for the strong interaction , with the non - abelian @xmath2 gauge group , the theory is thought to exhibit confinement .",
    "thus , it is not clear that one could arrange a non - abelian flux tube that one could control , as is the case with electromagnetism .",
    "further , since the color charges are always confined , one can not send isolated , unconfined color charges around hypothetical non - abelian magnetic flux tubes , unlike the abelian case of electromagnetism , where one can send isolated , unconfined electric charges around abelian magnetic flux tubes . despite these experimental obstacles , in this paper , we study the _ time - dependent _ aharonov - bohm effect for non - abelian fields .",
    "the first reason is that the aharonov - bohm effect is an important consequence of combining gauge theories with quantum mechanics , and so , it is of interest to see how replacing an abelian gauge theory by a non - abelian gauge theory changes ( if at all ) the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "second , the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect has not been investigated to any great degree , even for abelian gauge theories . in the two papers @xcite , the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect for abelian fields was investigated and a cancellation was found between the usual magnetic aharonov - bohm phase shift and the additional phase shift coming from the electric field , which inevitably occurs for time varying magnetic fields . in this paper , we want to see if a similar cancellation occurs between the non - abelian magnetic and electric fields .    for our time - dependent non - abelian field configurations , we take the non - abelian plane wave solutions of coleman @xcite and the time - dependent wu - yang monopole solution @xcite .",
    "both solutions satisfy the yang - mills field equations for non - abelian gauge fields of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coupling constant and @xmath5 are the group structure constants .",
    "@xmath6 is the non - abelian vector potential and the field strength tensor , @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 at this point in this paper , we will set @xmath9 .",
    "for the coleman non - abelian plane wave solutions , we find the same cancellation between the non - abelian magnetic and electric phase shifts that occur in the abelian case .",
    "we also find the same cancellation for the time - dependent wu - yang monopole solution .",
    "we conclude by giving some remarks as to the similarities between these two time - dependent non - abelian solutions and the time - dependent abelian case .",
    "we further postulate that the cancellation between the non - abelian magnetic and electric phase shifts found for the two specific solutions investigated here may be a feature of more general time - dependent non - abelian solutions .",
    "we begin by reviewing the properties of the two coleman plane wave solutions . the non - abelian vector potential for the first/@xmath10 solution is @xmath11 where @xmath12 , in light front coordinates , _ i.e. _ @xmath13 ( the speed of light will be set to unity , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath10 in the superscript labels this as the light front form of the solution traveling in the negative @xmath15 direction .",
    "the second solution gives waves traveling in the positive @xmath15 direction .",
    "the second solution is only a function of the light front coordinate @xmath16 , @xmath17 again , the superscript @xmath18 indicates this is the light front form of the solution traveling in the positive @xmath15 direction .",
    "the ansatz functions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are functions of @xmath21 but are otherwise arbitrary .",
    "first , plugging @xmath22 from into , the field strength tensor for the light front form of the @xmath10 solution becomes @xmath23 the non - zero components here are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "next plugging @xmath26 from into , the field strength tensor for the light front form of the @xmath18 solution becomes @xmath27 the non - zero components here are @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is interesting to note that neither of the forms of @xmath30 depend on the ansatz function @xmath31 . also , the non - abelian term , @xmath32 , is always zero for both the @xmath10 and @xmath18 solutions .",
    "thus , the solutions are  very weakly \" non - abelian since this prototypical non - abelian / non - linear term is absent .",
    "coleman noted that the @xmath10 solution given by , in terms of the vector potential , and by , in terms of the fields , provides an example of the wu - yang ambiguity @xcite  that in non - abelian theories , @xmath30 does not contain all the gauge invariant information about a particular solution , as is the case in abelian gauge theories .",
    "specifically , in terms of the vector potential , one has the quantity @xmath33 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 indicates path ordering and the @xmath35 are the lie algebra elements .",
    "the expression in is identified as the non - abelian aharonov - bohm phase factor in terms of the potentials .",
    "as well , the expression in is the wilson loop for gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we now consider a unit loop in the @xmath36 plane ( _ i.e. _ @xmath37 plane ) and starting from @xmath38 and @xmath39 and going in the direction given in figure [ fig1 ] .    for this loop",
    "the integral in the exponent in becomes @xmath40   d",
    "\\zeta ^+ ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second and fourth integrals ( _ i.e. _ @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are zero since @xmath43 for the @xmath10 solution in . for the third",
    "integral , we get @xmath44 d \\zeta ^+$ ] , since for this leg , @xmath45 and @xmath46 and one is going backward along the @xmath47 direction , while for the first integral , we get @xmath48 since @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath48 and @xmath50 do not cancel , due to the path ordering in .",
    "taking the path ordering into account and combining and one gets @xmath51   d \\zeta",
    "^+ \\right ) \\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from it is evident that there is no cancellation of the @xmath52 functions due to the non - trivial commutation relationship of @xmath35 and @xmath53 .",
    "the above result is equivalent to the result given in equation ( 8) of @xcite .",
    "now , the field strength version of ( and the field strength version of the aharonov - bohm phase for non - abelian theories @xcite ) is @xmath54 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the area and @xmath56 means  area \" ordering @xcite . for the unit area spanning the unit loop in the @xmath37 plane , the differential ",
    "area \" is given by @xmath57 .",
    "the reason that @xmath58 has @xmath59 rather than @xmath60 is that the  area \" vector should be perpendicular to the surface spanned by @xmath37 , and it is @xmath61 , not @xmath62 , which is perpendicular to @xmath58 , as seen in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath47 is perpendicular to @xmath63 .",
    "note that for this unit square the area ordering denoted by @xmath56 is simple since there is only one area vector . with only a single area vector the issue of ordering",
    "does not arise . as a result of the above discussion",
    ", the integral in the exponential in for the unit loop in the @xmath36 plane becomes @xmath64 this integral is zero since @xmath65 , which is due to the @xmath47 functional dependence of @xmath66 , but there is a sign difference between the @xmath67 integration and @xmath68 integration . for a unit loop in the @xmath69 plane ( _ i.e. _ @xmath70 plane ) , we would find a similar result as in , except for the replacement @xmath71 .",
    "since the area for this loop is @xmath72 , we again get @xmath73 , which then cancels because of the @xmath74 in the unit area element .",
    "the same result also holds for the @xmath18 solution from . in this case , the unit loop is in the @xmath75 plane ( _ i.e. _ @xmath76 plane ) or @xmath77 plane ( _ i.e. _ @xmath78 plane ) .",
    "the perpendicular areas in this case will be @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "now , the relevant integrals will be @xmath81 and @xmath82 , so that one again gets zero for the area integrals like @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this vanishing of the  area \" integral of the non - abelian field strengths , @xmath85 , occurs for both of these time - dependent , non - abelian solutions we examined .",
    "although we do not have a general proof , we conjecture that this cancellation will occur generally for time - dependent , non - abelian solutions . an important point to note",
    "is that it is only the time - dependent part of @xmath86 which is conjectured to vanish  the static parts of the fields still give the usual non - abelian aharonov - bohm phase .    in the light front coordinates ,",
    "the split between the non - abelian electric and magnetic field components is not so straight forward .",
    "just as the @xmath87 coordinates are mixtures of space and time coordinates , so too @xmath88 are mixtures of the non - abelian electric and magnetic field components .",
    "for this reason , we now perform the above analysis of @xmath89 and @xmath90 in cartesian coordinates @xmath91 .",
    "we do this for the @xmath10 solution of but the same analysis applies to the @xmath18 solution of .",
    "the @xmath92 components of the @xmath10 solution are the same in light front and cartesian coordinates . the time and @xmath15 components",
    "are obtained via @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which is the same way one transforms between @xmath95 and @xmath96 . also , note that the superscript @xmath10 labels the solution while the subscripts label the @xmath97 components of this solution .",
    "thus , in cartesian coordinates , the @xmath10 solution is @xmath98 where now @xmath99 rather than @xmath100 .",
    "the cartesian field strength tensor following from is @xmath101 where again the indices @xmath102 , @xmath103 are given by @xmath104 rather than @xmath105 . as a check , it is easy to verify that and satisfy the yang - mills field equations . in the form",
    ", the split between the non - abelian electric and magnetic components is obvious ",
    "the first row and column are the electric components and the @xmath106 sub matrix below and to the right of the first row and first column are the magnetic components .",
    "thus , in cartesian coordinates , the loop integral in the exponent in becomes @xmath107   ( dt ~ { \\rm or } ~ dz ) ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , the paths @xmath108 and @xmath109 do not contribute since the @xmath110-component of the @xmath10 solution in cartesian coordinates is zero , @xmath111 , as was the case for the solution in light front coordinates .",
    "paths @xmath112 and @xmath113 have equal components in the @xmath114 and @xmath15 directions and thus , pick out the gauge field components @xmath115 and @xmath116 . along path @xmath112 ,",
    "@xmath49 , so only @xmath52 appears ; while for path @xmath113 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so now both @xmath52 and @xmath66 appear . because of the dependence of @xmath117 on @xmath118 , the @xmath67 and @xmath68 integrals of these functions are the same .",
    "the end result is that the loop integral of the gauge field gives the same results in light front coordinates , , and in cartesian coordinates , .",
    "thus the phase shift calulated by the loop integral of the gauge fields  equation  is the same in both cartesian and light front coordinates .",
    "next , we calculate the surface area integral , @xmath86 , for the unit area from figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "taking into account the anti - symmetry of @xmath119 and @xmath55 under exchange of the indices , the @xmath10 solution , in cartesian coordinates , and with the surface in the @xmath120 plane from figure [ fig1 ] , we find that the surface area integral of the field strength tensor is @xmath121 there are two integrals  @xmath122 and @xmath123  which are absent from since for the unit area in the @xmath120 plane , @xmath124 .",
    "if we take a surface in the @xmath125 plane , then these two integrals would appear and instead , @xmath126 and @xmath127 from would vanish .",
    "the two integrals in cancel since @xmath65 , due to the fact that @xmath66 depends on @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , the two integrals for the @xmath70 plane cancel since @xmath73 , due to the fact that @xmath128 depends on @xmath118 .",
    "thus , in both the light front and cartesian form , the @xmath10 solution has @xmath129 . in",
    ", it is more apparent that the cancellation is between the non - abelian electric pieces ( the @xmath130 integrals ) and the corresponding non - abelian magnetic pieces ( the @xmath131 integrals ) .",
    "as coleman already noted , the expression @xmath89 in does not in general agree with @xmath132 in for the light front solutions in and .",
    "we have shown that the same is true ( as it should be ) in cartesian coordinate version of the solution .",
    "this is taken by coleman @xcite as an illustration of the wu - yang ambiguity @xcite  in non - abelian gauge theories , not all the gauge invariant information is contained in the field strength tensor .",
    "we now examine the issue of the time - dependent , non - abelian aharonov - bohm phase for the time - dependent @xmath133 wu - yang monopole solution , where @xmath134 .",
    "this solution is different in two respects from the non - abelian plane - waves of the previous section .",
    "first , in contrast to the non - abelian plane wave solution of the previous section , the time - dependent @xmath133 wu - yang monopole solution is more strongly non - abelian since the prototypical non - abelian term ( @xmath135 ) is non - zero .",
    "second , in the light front coordinates of the previous section the non - abelian electric and magnetic components of the field strength tensor are mixed up ( combined ) in non - zero components like @xmath136 or @xmath137 . for the time - dependent @xmath133 wu - yang monopole solution of this section ,",
    "the field strength tensor is split into separate non - abelian electric ( _ e.g. _ @xmath138 ) and magnetic ( _ e.g. _ @xmath139 ) pieces .",
    "the vector potential for the time - dependent wu - yang solution is given by @xcite @xmath140 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is a radial and time dependent function and @xmath142 is the su(2 ) levi - civita structure constant of the group .",
    "for this time - dependent solution , one works specifically with the su(2 ) group , whereas for the non - abelian plane - wave solution of the last section , the lie group was arbitrary .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , the non - abelian part of the field strength tensor did not play a big role in the coleman solutions .",
    "for this reason , the exact nature of the non - abelian group was not so crucial for the coleman plane wave solutions . from",
    ", one can immediately find the associated field strength tensor as @xmath143 where the dot denotes a time derivative and the prime denotes a radial derivative .",
    "the first two terms in @xmath131 are the abelian / pure curl part of the non - abelian magnetic field ( _ i.e. _ @xmath144 _ k$ ] ) . also the non - abelian electric field , @xmath145 , is abelian in character since the prototypical , non - abelian piece , @xmath146 , is not present .",
    "one can thus show , generally , that there is a cancellation between the abelian part of the non - abelian electric field and the abelian part of the non - abelian magnetic field , @xmath147 _ i$ ] .",
    "for this abelian part of the fields from , the  area \" integral that appears in the field strength version of the aharonov - bohm phase is @xmath148 where for the first ,  electric area \" integral , we have done the time integration to get @xmath149 ; for the second , magnetic area integral , we have used stokes theorem to get @xmath150 , which then cancels the first , electric term .",
    "note , for the first , electric term , one leg of the  area \" is a time piece .",
    "however , the last , non - abelian term in the magnetic field ",
    "_ i.e. _ the term @xmath151 in  could give a non - zero contribution to the calculation , so at first sight one would not , in general , expect the same kind of cancellation between the non - abelian electric and magnetic parts that occurred in for the coleman solution . to this end , we will look at the full non - abelian fields of for a specific contour bounding a specific area , and we will see that there is still a complete cancellation between the electric and magnetic parts , as there was for the coleman solutions of the previous section . the specific contour we take is a hoop of radius @xmath152 in the @xmath153 plane going in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "the area spanning this contour is a circle with area @xmath154 , _",
    "i.e. _ pointing in the @xmath155 direction",
    ". the surface and contour are shown in figure [ fig2 ] . in evaluating the electric and magnetic parts of",
    ", we will consider infinitesimal path lengths , @xmath156 , and infinitesimal areas , @xmath157  see figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we begin by looking at the non - abelian electric contribution @xmath158 . for the @xmath130 from ,",
    "one finds @xmath159^a \\int \\dot f(r , t ) dt = \\delta \\varphi \\delta f \\delta^{a3 } ~,\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that @xmath160^a = \\delta \\varphi r^2 \\delta^{a3}$ ] , _ i.e. _ this integral gives twice the area of an infinitesimal wedge from the surface in figure [ fig2 ] ( see also figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the direction of the area is in the @xmath113 or @xmath161 direction . from the @xmath162 symbol in , with @xmath163 ,",
    "the color index is fixed as @xmath164 . to make @xmath165 explicit ,",
    "we have inserted @xmath166 into the final expression in .",
    "the time integration has been done for an infinitesimal interval @xmath167 , so @xmath168 .",
    "now we calculate the non - abelian magnetic contribution to the phase .",
    "we do this in two separate pieces : the abelian part , @xmath169 , and the non - abelian part , @xmath170 .",
    "first , for the abelian part , we have @xmath171 for our contour from figure [ fig2 ] , the first term in has @xmath172 since we are in the @xmath153 plane . but",
    "as well , for the summation over the @xmath173 index , we also need @xmath174 or @xmath175 . for @xmath176 , we would have @xmath177 , but @xmath178 for the contour and surface we are using , so for @xmath176 , the first term in is zero .",
    "taking all this into account , if we look at @xmath179 and @xmath180 , we find that the indexed part of the first term in is @xmath181 since in the @xmath153 plane @xmath182 .",
    "note also that the color index , @xmath183 , is forced to be @xmath165 . with this , the first term of becomes @xmath184 next , since our surface and contour from figure [ fig2 ] are in the @xmath153 plane , this means @xmath185 , thus , for the last term in , this implies that @xmath165 , and we find that this term becomes @xmath186 where in the @xmath153 plane @xmath187 become @xmath188 .",
    "the second term in will cancel the term in .",
    "the first term in will have a @xmath189 from the infinitesimal @xmath190 integration . then using infinitesimal notation for the @xmath191 integration ( _ i.e. _ @xmath192 )",
    ", we arrive at @xmath193 which then cancels the electric contribution .",
    "thus , at this point we have confirmed , with specific contours and areas , the cancellation between the electric and  abelian magnetic \" parts of the non - abelian aharonov - bohm phase , which was shown generally in .",
    "the final piece we need to deal with is the prototypical non - abelian piece of the magnetic contribution , namely @xmath194 this piece is seen to vanish since @xmath163 due to the contour / area from figure [ fig2 ] lying in the @xmath153 plane .",
    "this forces @xmath176 so that @xmath195 , but since we are in the @xmath153 plane @xmath178 , so this prototypical non - abelian contribution vanishes .",
    "thus , as for the coleman plane wave solution of the previous section , we find a cancellation between the electric and magnetic parts of the non - abelian aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "although here we have shown this cancellation for only two types of time - dependent non - abelian solutions and with specific contours , we nevertheless advance the hypothesis that this cancellation is a general feature of both abelian and non - abelian aharonov - bohm phases for time - dependent fields .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that , like the coleman solutions , the time - dependent wu - yang monopole solution shows a non - zero phase when calculated using the potential @xmath196 where in the last step we are considering an infinitesimal path length as in figure [ fig3 ] , in conjunction with an infinitesimal change in the potential @xmath197 . using the form for @xmath198 from , we find @xmath199^a \\right)~.\\ ] ] in the last step , we have canceled two minus signs but have switched the @xmath200 and @xmath201 index which then gives an additional minus sign . also , we have used @xmath202 .",
    "finally , we again use @xmath203^a = \\delta \\varphi r^2 \\delta^{a3}$ ] and find that @xmath204 this produces only the non - abelian magnetic phase contribution from the fields calculation . in the next section , we will discuss this non - equivalence between the time - dependent aharonov - bohm phase shift , calculated using the potentials versus the field strengths , by comparing with the time - dependent _ abelian _ aharonov - bohm phase case .",
    "in the previous two sections , we discussed the time - dependent aharonov - bohm phase shift for non - abelian fields for two specific solutions ( the coleman plane wave solutions and the time - dependent wu - yang monopole ) and two specific contours ( a unit square in the @xmath37 plane and a ring of radius @xmath152 in the @xmath153 plane ) . for the coleman solutions , the field strength tensors had no contribution from the non - abelian term , @xmath205 , and the functional form of the field strengths was essentially the same as for abelian plane wave solutions .",
    "one distinction between the coleman non - abelian plane waves and abelian planes waves is that superposition does not apply for the coleman plane waves . for the time - dependent wu - yang monopole solution ,",
    "the electric field strength terms had no contribution from the non - abelian part of the solution , but the magnetic field did .",
    "however , this non - abelian part for the magnetic field was found not to contribute to the aharonov - bohm phase for the specific paths and surfaces we used , which are shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( see also figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we now review the abelian , time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect and draw parallels with the non - abelian case .",
    "the time - independent abelian aharonov - bohm effect has been well studied theoretically and also been confirmed experimentally @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent experimental tests using tunneling ) .",
    "in contrast , the _ time - dependent _ abelian aharonov - bohm effect has received much less attention .",
    "some of the papers dealing with the time - dependent abelian aharonov - bohm effect are @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . the paper @xcite predicts a time - shifting interference pattern for the time - dependent abelian aharonov - bohm effect , while @xcite @xcite find a cancellation of the time dependent electric and magnetic contributions and thus a non - shifting interference pattern .",
    "the few experiments done on the time - dependent abelian aharonov - bohm effect ( see @xcite @xcite and also @xcite for an  accidental \" test of the time - dependent abelian aharonov - bohm effect ) confirm that predictions of @xcite @xcite , but each experiment had problems .",
    "thus , a definitive test of the time - dependent abelian aharonov - bohm effect , to distinguish between the predictions of @xcite and @xcite @xcite , still needs to be done .",
    "the vector potential for a time - dependent aharonov - bohm solenoid is given by @xcite @xcite ( we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath206 and the magnetic flux tube has a radius @xmath152 ) @xmath207 to begin with , we have taken the scalar potential , @xmath208 , as zero .",
    "we return to this point later since there are non - single valued gauges where there is a non - zero _ and _ non - single valued @xmath208 .",
    "the possibility of a non - single valued @xmath208 leads to something similar to the wu - yang ambiguity but for time - dependent abelian fields .",
    "the magnetic and electric fields coming from are @xmath209 and @xmath210    evaluating the aharonov - bohm phase using the fields , for the infinitesimal path and associated area in figure [ fig3 ] gives @xmath211 by expanding @xmath212 and identifying the infinitesimal path , @xmath213 and the area , @xmath214 , equation becomes @xmath215 the time - dependent parts of the phase shift cancel each other , while the static aharonov - bohm phase shift , due to @xmath216 , remains .      comparing the above calculations and discussion with the previous non - abelian results",
    ", we see that in both abelian and non - abelian theories there is a cancellation between the time - dependent electric and magnetic contributions to the aharonov - bohm phase shift . for the non - abelian case we have only shown this cancellation for two specific , time - dependent solutions and for special contours and surfaces .",
    "although we have not shown this cancellation for the non - abelian fields in general , we nevertheless conjecture that this is a feature of more general time - dependent non - abelian field configurations .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the aharonov - bohm effect for _ time - dependent _ non - abelian fields .",
    "in contrast to the abelian aharonov - bohm effect , much less work has been done on even the _ time - independent _ non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect ",
    "reference @xcite is one of the few works to deal with the time - independent non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the reason for this most likely lies in the difficulty in experimentally setting up and controlling non - abelian field configurations . in comparison ,",
    "abelian fields can be much more easily manipulated _",
    "e.g. _ setting up the magnetic flux tube , which is used in the canonical abelian , aharonov - bohm setup . in this work , we studied ( for the first time as far as we could determine from the literature ) the aharonov - bohm effect for time - dependent non - abelian fields .",
    "we did this using two specific , known time - dependent solutions ( the coleman plane wave solutions @xcite and the time - dependent wu - yang monopole of @xcite ) and using specific contours and associated areas ( see figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",

    "for the coleman @xmath10 solution , this cancellation is given in equation and for the time - dependent wu - yang monopole , this cancellation is given in equations , and .",

    "<S> , we find a cancellation between the phase shift coming from the non - abelian `` magnetic '' field and the phase shift coming from the non - abelian `` electric '' field , which inevitably arises in time - dependent cases . </S>",
    "<S> we compare and contrast this cancellation for the time - dependent non - abelian case to a similar cancellation which occurs in the time - dependent abelian case . </S>",
    "<S> we postulate that this cancellation occurs generally in time - dependent situations for both abelian and non - abelian fields . </S>"
