    "indistinguishability of nonorthogonal states is a basic feature of quantum mechanics that has deep implications in many areas , as quantum computation and communication , quantum entanglement , cloning , and cryptography . since the pioneering work of helstrom @xcite on quantum hypothesis testing",
    ", the problem of discriminating nonorthogonal quantum states has received a lot of attention @xcite , with some experimental verifications as well @xcite .",
    "the most popular scenarios are : @xmath0 the minimum - error probability discrimination @xcite , where each measurement outcome selects one of the possible states and the error probability is minimized ; @xmath1 the optimal unambiguous discrimination @xcite , where unambiguity is paid by the possibility of getting inconclusive results from the measurement ; @xmath2 the minimax strategy @xcite where the smallest of the probabilities of correct detection is maximized . stimulated by the rapid developments in quantum information theory , the problem of discrimination has been addressed also for bipartite quantum states , along with the comparison of global strategies where unlimited kind of measurements is considered , with the scenario of locc scheme , where only local measurements and classical communication are allowed @xcite",
    ". the concepts of nonorthogonality and distinguishability can be applied also to quantum operations , namely all physically allowed transformations of quantum states , and some work has been devoted to the problem of discriminating unitary transformations @xcite and more general quantum operations @xcite .",
    "the quantum indistinguishability principle is closely related to another very popular , yet often misunderstood , principle ( formerly known as heisenberg principle  @xcite ) : it is not possible to extract information from a quantum system without perturbing it somehow .",
    "in fact , if the experimenter could gather information about an unknown quantum state without disturbing it at all , even if such information is partial , by performing further non - disturbing measurements on the same system , he could finally determine the state , in contradiction with the indistinguishability principle  @xcite .",
    "actually , there exists a precise tradeoff between the amount of information extracted from a quantum measurement and the amount of disturbance caused on the system , analogous to heisenberg relations holding in the preparation procedure of a quantum state .",
    "quantitative derivations of such a tradeoff have been obtained in the scenario of quantum state estimation @xcite .",
    "the optimal tradeoff has been derived in the following cases : in estimating a single copy of an unknown pure state @xcite , many copies of identically prepared pure qubits @xcite , a single copy of a pure state generated by independent phase - shifts @xcite , an unknown maximally entangled state @xcite , an unknown coherent state @xcite and gaussian state @xcite , and an unknown spin coherent state @xcite .",
    "experiment realization of minimal disturbance measurements has been also reported @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we review the characterization of the tradeoff relation in quantum state discrimination of ref .",
    "@xcite , and suggest an experimental realization of the minimum - disturbing measurement . in this case , an unknown quantum state is chosen with equal _ a priori _ probability from a set of two non orthogonal pure states , and the error probability of the discrimination is allowed to be suboptimal ( thus intuitively causing less disturbance with respect to the optimal discrimination ) . a measuring strategy that achieves the optimal tradeoff",
    "is shown to smoothly interpolate between the two limiting cases of maximal information extraction and no measurement at all .",
    "the issue of the information - disturbance tradeoff for state discrimination can become of practical relevance for posing general limits in information eavesdropping and for analyzing security of quantum cryptographic communications .",
    "after briefly reviewing the optimal information - disturbance tradeoff in quantum state discrimination and the corresponding measurement instrument , we analyze two possible experimental realization of the minimum - disturbing measurement .",
    "typically , in quantum state discrimination we are given two ( fixed ) non orthogonal pure states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and we want to construct a measurement discriminating between the two .",
    "we can describe a measurement by means of an _ instrument _ @xcite , namely , a collection of completely positive maps @xmath7 , labelled by the measurement outcomes @xmath8 . using the kraus decomposition  @xcite , one can always write @xmath9 . in the case",
    "the sum comprises just one term , namely , @xmath10 , the map @xmath11 is called _ pure _ , since it maps pure states into pure states .",
    "the trace @xmath12=\\tr[\\pi_i\\rho]$ ] , where @xmath13 is a positive operator associated to the @xmath14-th outcome , provides the probability that the measurement performed on a quantum system described by the density matrix @xmath15 gives the @xmath14-th outcome .",
    "the posterior ( or reduced ) state after the measurement is given by @xmath16 $ ] . the averaged reduced state  coming from ignoring the measurement outcome  is simply obtained using the _ trace - preserving _",
    "map @xmath17 .",
    "the trace - preservation constraint for @xmath18 implies that the set of positive operators @xmath19 is actually a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) , satisfying the completeness condition @xmath20 .",
    "quantum state discrimination is then performed by a two - outcome instrument @xmath21 whose capability of discriminating between @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be evaluated by the average success probability @xmath22 = \\sum_{i=1}^2p_i\\tr[\\pi_i|\\psi_i\\>\\<\\psi_i|].\\ ] ] notice that @xmath23 actually depends only on the povm @xmath19 . the probability @xmath23 quantifies the amount of information that the instrument @xmath21 is able to extract from the ensemble @xmath24 . among all instruments achieving average success probability @xmath25",
    "( the bar over @xmath23 means that we fix the value of @xmath23 ) , we are interested in those minimizing the average disturbance caused on the unknown state , that we evaluate in terms of the average fidelity , namely , @xmath26 differently from @xmath23 , the disturbance @xmath27 strongly depends on the particular form of the instrument @xmath7 .",
    "this means that there exist many different instruments achieving the same @xmath23 , but giving different values of @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the disturbance produced by the _",
    "least disturbing _ instrument that discriminates @xmath3 from @xmath4 with average success probability @xmath25 .",
    "intuitive arguments suggest that the larger is @xmath25 , the larger must correspondingly be @xmath29 ( i.  e. , the larger is the amount of information extracted , the larger is the disturbance caused by the measurement ) . the precise derivation of the optimal tradeoff @xmath30 has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with the corresponding optimal measurement , for equal _ a priori _ probabilities , i.  e. @xmath31 . in the following we briefly review the main results .",
    "let us start reviewing the case of the measurement maximizing @xmath23 .",
    "notice that , given two generally non orthogonal pure states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , it is always possible to choose an orthonormal basis @xmath32 , placed symmetrically around @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : quadrante ] ) , on which both states have real components , namely @xmath33 and fidelity @xmath34 . in this case , it is known  @xcite that the maximum achievable @xmath23 is given by @xmath35 which is obtained by the orthogonal von neumann measurement @xmath36 .    the instrument achieving @xmath37 , that minimizes the disturbance @xmath27 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the unitary operator @xmath40 @xmath41 , and @xmath42 satisfies the equation @xcite @xmath43 equation ( [ eq : ui ] ) represents a measure - and - prepare realization : the observable @xmath44 is measured and , depending on the outcome , the quantum state @xmath45 is prepared .",
    "the states @xmath46 are symmetrically tilted with respect to the @xmath47 s , see fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrante ] .    the presence of the tilt @xmath48 can be understood by noticing that minimum error discrimination can never be error - free for non orthogonal states . even using the optimal helstrom s measurement",
    ", there is always a non zero error probability , and , the closer the input states are to each other , the smaller the success probability is .",
    "hence , it is reasonable that , the closer the input states are , the less `` trustworthy '' the measurement outcome is , and the average disturbance is minimized by cautiously preparing a new state that actually is a coherent superpositions of both hypotheses @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the minimum disturbance for helstrom s optimal measurement is given by @xmath49 notice that @xmath50 reaches its maximum for @xmath51 , namely , when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are `` unbiased '' with respect to each other ( @xmath52 ) .    by allowing a suboptmal discrimination , with success probability @xmath53",
    ", one can cause less disturbance . in this case , by parametrizing the average success probability thorugh a control parameter @xmath54 as follows @xmath55 with @xmath56 , one can search , among all possible measurements achieving @xmath57 , the one minimizing the disturbance @xmath58 .",
    "it turns out that , for any value of @xmath57 , the minimum disturbance @xmath59 is achieved by the _ pure _",
    "instrument @xmath60 , where @xcite @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath63 in the above equation generalizes that in eq .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) as follows @xmath64 with @xmath65 it follows that every instrument that achieves average success probability @xmath57 must cause _ at least _ an average disturbance @xmath66.\\ ] ]    just by varying the control parameter @xmath54 , it is possible to smoothly move between the limiting cases . for @xmath67 , we obtain the identity map , that is , the no - measurement case . for @xmath68 , we obtain helstrom s instrument in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ui ] ) , and eq .  ( [ eq : tilt - t ] ) reproduces the tilt given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilt ] ) .",
    "however , the crucial difference between helstrom s limit ( @xmath68 ) and the intermediate cases is that , for @xmath69 , the optimal instrument _ can not _ be interpreted by means of a measure - and - prepare scheme , and the unitaries @xmath63 and @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kraus - t ] ) represent feedback rotations for outcomes @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    by eliminating the parameter @xmath54 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prob1-t ] ) and  ( [ eq : dist1-t ] ) , one can obtain the optimal tradeoff between information and disturbance , for any value of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "in this section we want to show two experimental schemes for the realization of the minimum - disturbing measurement .",
    "the two - level input system is encoded on photons degrees of freedom .",
    "since we are interested not only in the success probability but also in the posterior state of the system _ after _ the measurement , we have to focus on indirect measurement schemes , in which the system is previously made interact with a probe , and , after such interaction , a projective measurement is performed on the probe .",
    "the _ mathematical _",
    "parameter @xmath54 controlling the tradeoff in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob1-t ] ) can then be put in correspondence with a _ physical _ parameter controlling the strength of the interaction between the system and the probe .",
    "the case @xmath67 means that the interaction is actually factorized and that the subsequent measurement on the probe does not provide any information about the system and the latter is completely unaffected by the probe s measurement .",
    "this is precisely the no - measurement case . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath68 identifies a _ completely entangling _ interaction , or , in other words , a situation in which a measurement on the probe gives the largest amount of information about the system , consequently causing the largest disturbance . in the following ,",
    "two possible settings are discussed : the first one , which is deterministic and involves the _ dual - rail _ representation of qubits  @xcite , and the second one which is probabilistic and involves the qubit encoding on the polarization state of a single photon .      in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown how to achieve a maximally entangling gate of the c - not type , i.  e. @xmath75 by combining , in the dual - rail representation of qubits , two hadamard gates with a non - linear interaction caused by a kerr medium coupling the two modes @xmath76 ( system ) and @xmath77 ( probe ) . more explicitly , by varying the interaction time ( or length ) between the system mode and the probe mode inside the kerr medium , it is possible to achieve the following unitary evolution : @xmath78 the two limiting cases correspond to @xmath79 for which @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for which @xmath82 realizes a perfect c - not gate .",
    "then , to measure the von neumann observable @xmath36 on the probe is equivalent to apply the instrument in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kraus - t ] ) onto the system , with @xmath83 . the feedback unitary rotation  ( [ eq : unitary - t ] ) can be subsequently applied conditional to the probe measurement outcome .",
    "this scheme is _",
    ", that is , no events have to be discarded .",
    "however , approaching the limiting value @xmath81 ( or , equivalently , @xmath68 ) is quite hard , since too large nonlinearity is needed  @xcite .",
    "hence , such a setup can be useful only for regimes with @xmath74 .",
    "the second proposal is a modification of the setup already used in ref .",
    "@xcite to experimentally realize a _",
    "universal _ minimum - disturbing measurement . with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , only the feedback rotations are different .",
    "this setup has the great advantage of being completely achievable by linear optics . in order to entangle the system with the probe",
    ", it needs an _ entangling measurement _ to be performed on the joint system - probe  state .",
    "such a measurement is in fact a parity check , namely a measurement of the observable @xmath84 however , since the outcome `` @xmath85 '' corresponds to a situation in which the input photon and the probe photon are indistinguishable , we are forced to post - select just one half of the events , discarding those corresponding to the outcome @xmath85 . a part of this major drawback , limiting the actual usefulness of such a measuring instrument in practical application , using this setup it is possible to explore the whole range of the parameter values @xmath86 $ ] , contrarily to what happens using non - linear media",
