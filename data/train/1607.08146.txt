    "in recent years , coplanar waveguide ( cpw ) resonators have proven to be a unique tool for probing a wide variety of excitations in circuits and materials , including superconducting qubits  @xcite , ferromagnetic spin ensembles  @xcite and magnons  @xcite . due to their ultra - low ohmic losses",
    ", they usually exhibit very high quality factors , making them very sensitive to external perturbations .",
    "as their properties are , to a large extent , defined by their geometry and by the dielectric response of their environment , they make a promising candidate as probes for materials with exotic electronic properties .",
    "transition metal oxides ( tmos ) heterointerfaces exhibit a variety of electronic and structural properties , including 2d superconductivity  @xcite , ferroelectric / magnetic orders  @xcite and negative capacitance  @xcite .",
    "probably the most ubiquitous representative of transition metal oxides is .",
    "its chemical stability , lattice constant and dielectric characteristics make it one of the standard substrates for the growth of high - quality crystalline thin films . at low temperatures is characterized by an extremely high dielectric response ( @xmath1 at 4 k  @xcite ) originating from an incipient ferroelectric transition ( quantum paraelectricity ) .",
    "the permittivity is affected by electric fields , and below 4 k it can be lowered by more than one order of magnitude for a field of about 2 mv / m  @xcite .",

    "a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator is fabricated on top of a -terminated single - crystal ( 001 ) substrate ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "the cpw is a 45  mm long line with a meander shape , the central strip is 30  @xmath5 wide , with a 10  @xmath5 gap to the ground plane .",
    "the geometric parameters are chosen such that a significant impedance mismatch is created between the transmission line ( @xmath6 ) and the resonator ( @xmath7 at 3.5 k , which acts as a mirror for microwave photons ) .",
    "this , together with the open end of the resonator , creates a @xmath8 cavity .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) shows a top - view optical image of the device together with a schematic of the measurement setup .",
    "our measurement scheme provides galvanic access to the central strip , so a dc bias can be easily applied with respect to the ground plane .",
    "reflection measurements ( @xmath9 ) are performed using a vector network analyser , while the sample is always kept at a fixed temperature of 3.5 k.    we obtain quantitative information on the dielectric properties of the sto by direct comparison with an identical cpw fabricated on top of a sapphire substrate ( @xmath10 , independent on temperature and electric field ) .",
    "as the inductance of both waveguides is the same , the ratio of the frequencies of the fundamental modes of the two resonators allows us to extract @xmath11 as follows : @xmath12    a reflection measurement @xmath3 of the cavity modes is presented in fig .",

    "the dashed black line is measured right after cooldown while the orange curve after subsequent field sweeps . ]",
    "the galvanic connection of the feedline to the cpw resonator enables us to apply a voltage difference between the central strip and the ground plane .",
    "the narrow 10  @xmath5 gap converts a relatively small voltage to an intense and localised electric field ( 1 v @xmath18 100 kv / m ) .",
    "a similar local gating scheme was used recently in transport experiments in oxide systems  @xcite .",
    "the modification of the local dielectric constant caused by the dc bias results in a change of the total capacitance of the cpw and a corresponding shift of its resonance frequencies . by tracking the resonance frequency as a function of applied voltage across the gap , we probe the electric field dependence of the dielectric properties of in a wide range of values .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](a ) we show a color plot of the reflection parameter @xmath16 as a function of dc - field from -1.5 to 1.5 mv / m . by applying -15 v ( -1.5 mv / m ) to the central strip , the fundamental mode shifts from 25 mhz to 66 mhz , which corresponds to a tunability of 160 % . by applying 3",

    "we calculated @xmath19 during the first field sweep just after the cooldown ( black dashed line ) and after subsequent sweeps in the @xmath17 1.5 mv / m range ( orange solid line ) .",
    "there is an evident non - reversible modification of the dielectric constant at low bias after the application of the field , where @xmath20 is reduced from the initial value of 22,825 to less than 16,000 .",
    "this behavior , typically observed in -based devices , is usually attributed to pinning of domain walls  @xcite .",
    "the electric field dependence of the dielectric constant of sto at low temperatures can be described in first approximation by the landau - ginzburg - devonshire theory  @xcite : @xmath21^{1/3}},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the electric field and @xmath23 is a parameter related to the tunability of the dielectric constant with electric field . during the first field sweep ( black dashed line ) , we extracted a value for @xmath23 = 71.5 kv / m , whereas in subsequent sweeps ( orange line ) , this value increased to @xmath23 = 146.8 kv / m , indicating a decrease in the polarizability of the sto . in section",
    "v , we provide a detailed analysis of this effect .",
    "due to their low intrinsic losses  @xcite , superconducting more resonators provide a good platform for characterization of the loss mechanisms of the surrounding dielectric environment .",
    "dielectric losses are typically evaluated through the loss tangent ( @xmath24 ) defined as the ratio between the imaginary ( @xmath25 ) and real part ( @xmath26 ) of the relative permittivity @xmath27 that can be directly obtained from fitting the reflection coefficient from a single port cavity ( @xmath16 ) with its definition : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the measured width of the resonance peak , and @xmath30 its frequency .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) shows @xmath31 as a function of dc electric field extracted from the resonance measurements for the first dc sweep .",
    "the increase of @xmath31 with @xmath22 can be described by the so - called quasi - debye mechanism  @xcite , which is the dominant dissipation channel in incipient ferroelectrics .",
    "this mechanism originates from the interplay between dc and rf components of the excitation .",
    "the dc field breaks the lattice symmetry , making the phonon spectrum field - dependent .",
    "the rf field acts as a time - modulation of the phonon frequencies , which are continuously driven out of equilibrium with consequent energy dissipation .",
    "this increase has been already observed in sto single crystals  @xcite , while it is in striking difference with several studies on thin films , where the application of an electric field lead to a decrease in @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) shows the loss tangent for the first four resonance modes ( @xmath32 = 25 mhz , @xmath33 = 50 mhz , @xmath34 = 75 mhz and @xmath35 = 100 mhz ) upon increasing the rf power from @xmath3645 dbm to + 5 dbm measured at zero dc field .",
    "the observed increase of @xmath31 with applied power is consistent with the incipient ferroelectricity considered in the quasi - debye model  @xcite .",
    "however , the mode number dependence in this frequency range ( from 1 to 100 mhz ) is not captured in the discussed theoretical framework , pointing towards a more complex scenario .    in order to gain further insight into the characteristics of the losses in sto",
    ", we also probed the power dependence of @xmath31 at different values of the dc field .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) , showing a saturation effect for high dc bias . for a field above 0.5  mv / m",
    ", @xmath37 becomes almost power - independent , being weakly affected by increasing the amplitude of the rf field .",
    "this interplay between dc and rf field can not be reconciled with a simple linear approximation for the dissipation mechanism  @xcite , indicating the need of non - linear models .",
    "+     in fig .  [ fig : fig4 ] , we explore the influence of voltage polarity on the hysteretic response of the dielectric properties of sto . to do so we followed the measurement sequences sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4](a ) : starting from zero bias , we applied a voltage ramp up to a target value @xmath38 and then back to @xmath39 0 , where the cpw spectrum is acquired .",
    "this procedure is repeated for increasing values of @xmath38 up to 15 v , always with the same polarity .",
    "we then perform a thermal cycle up to room temperature to restore the initial sample condition .",
    "we probed under three biasing schemes : positive , negative and positive after negative ( zero average ) .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) shows that the value of @xmath15 at zero field is not symmetric with respect to the applied field polarity and , in particular , it is significantly affected only by negative biases .",
    "we thus link the origin of the reduction of permittivity to the presence of oxygen vacancies , since a negative bias can increase their concentration in the surroundings of the waveguide , where the dielectric environment is probed .",
    "this scenario is supported by the partial recovery observed when a positive voltage follows a negative one ( yellow squares of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) and also by a time resolved measurement presented in the supplemental material .",
    "this explains the low tunability reported for cpws realized on top of sto thin films ; since even the very low defects concentration present at the surface of our substrate is already capable of lowering the dielectric response by more than 25 % after the application of 15 v.    this asymmetric response is also observed in the dielectric losses presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](c ) .",
    "however , we note that the measured response depends unexpectedly on the mode number . as a general trend , a monotonic increase of the losses is observed , which is explained by a progressive accumulation of polarized defects for negative biases  @xcite .",
    "however , for low mode numbers and bias values below 10 v , the application of an electric field results in a decrease of @xmath31 . in the supplemental material , we provide an extensive mapping of the losses showing the evolution of @xmath31 as a function of the negative voltage and mode number .",
    "in conclusion , we realized a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator directly on top of a single - crystal substrate and probed its dielectric properties as a function of dc electric field , rf power injected in the line and mode number .",
    "the measured dielectric constant of the sample in the initial condition was @xmath40 23,000 , lowered below 4,000 by applying a field of 1.5 mv / m .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath31 show an asymmetric response with respect to the field polarity , with a progressive reduction of the cpw tunability range , pointing towards the presence of charged defects , such as oxygen vacancies , as the origin of the observed behavior .",
    "this study demonstrates the sensitivity of superconducting microwave cavities as probes of quantum matter .",
    "the narrow gap ( 10 @xmath41 m ) increases the sensitivity of the microwave response to effects on a lengthscale of the order of the gap size . by further shrinking its dimensions",
    ", a microwave cavity can act as a local probe capable of studying , for example , the dynamics and the dielectric behavior of single domain walls , characteristic of at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "we argue that this technique can find broad applicability in the study of emergent phenomena at oxide interfaces , including 2d superconductivity , ferroelectricity and magnetism .",
