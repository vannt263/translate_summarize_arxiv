    "in the trans - neptuninan region , numerous planetesimal binaries have been found .",
    "so far , 79 planetesimal binaries have been found in the trans - neptunian object ( tno ) region ( http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/tnoslist.html ) .",
    "this number is about @xmath1% of known tnos between 30au and 70au ( stephens and noll , 2006 ) , and @xmath2% of the objects in the cold classical kuiper belt ( noll et al . , 2008a ) .",
    "some asteroids in the main belt have satellites ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "these satellites have relatively small mass compared to the primaries , and their eccentricities are quite small ( pravec et al . 2006 ) . on the other hand , trans - neptunian binaries ( tnbs )",
    "are known to have almost equal brightness ( noll et al .",
    "2008b ) , implying comparable mass .",
    "hence , planetesimal binary systems with mass ratio @xmath31 are frequently observed in the tno region .",
    "the distribution of the eccentricities of tnbs is pretty wide , from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .    on the other hand ,",
    "such systems have been hardly found in the asteroid belt region .",
    "the main physical difference between the inner region of the disk and the outer region of the disk is the ratio between the hill radius and the physical radius of the planetesimals .",
    "hill radius ( @xmath6 ) of a planetesimal with mass @xmath7 and semi major axis of @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 . since it is proportional to @xmath8 , it is 30 times larger at 30au compared to that of 1au for a same planetesimal .",
    "hence , the way two planetesimals interact can be quite different in the tno region and in the inner region , like the asteroid belt region .",
    "some of the inner main belt objects are known to have relatively small size ratio(around 1:3 ) and small separation ( johnston 2012 ) .",
    "they are most likely to be formed through the breakup of fast rotating asteroids ( walsh & richardson 2006 , walsh et al .",
    "2008 , 2012 ) .",
    "one almost equal - sized binary system , 90 antiope , was found in 2000 ( merline et al . 2000 ) .",
    "its origin is so far not well understood , but a recent observation indicates that two components are chemically similar ( marchis et al .",
    "2011 ) , indicating the primordial origin of the binary .",
    "since the physical ratio of planetesimals in unit of the hill radius are large in the inner region of the disk , two planetesimals can easily collide .",
    "some of the collisions form fragments around planetesimals , resulting in small planetesimals orbiting around large planetesimal with small eccentricity . on the other hand , in the tno region , hill radii of the planetesimals are large",
    ". therefore , physical collisions are less frequent , and complex interactions , including three - body encounters , are more frequent compared to the inner region .",
    "large planetesimals tend to have smaller random velocities than those of small planetesimals due to the equipartition of the energy .",
    "since the binaries are formed through three - body encounters , the eccentricity of the binaries is not restricted to small values .",
    "several formation scenarios have been proposed to explain the observed characteristics of tnbs ( weidenschilling 2002 , goldreich et al .",
    "2002 , funato et al .",
    "2004 , astakhov et al .",
    "2005 , nesvorn@xmath10 et al .",
    "2010 ) . weidenschilling ( 2002 )",
    "proposed a scenario in which two planetesimals collide and accrete within the gravitational effect of the third body .",
    "however , collision frequency is too low to explain the number of observed tnbs .",
    "goldreich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed two mechanisms . when the distance between two bodies becomes closer than the hill radius , a third planetesimal encounters with them and takes away the energy leaving the two planetesimals being gravitationally bound ( goldreich et al . 2002 )",
    "this is the scenario that we described above .",
    "another mechanism goldreich et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed is that instead of the third planetesimal , swarm of small planetesimals takes away the energy of two encountering planetesimals ( goldreich et al .",
    "exchange of a small satellite with another large planetesimal is proposed by funato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . transitional binary being tightened by several close encounters of other planetesimals ( chaos - assisted capture ) is proposed by astackhov et al .",
    "planetesimal binary formation by gravitational instability is introduced by nesvorn@xmath10 et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "all of these studies , except for nesvorn@xmath10 et al . , gave purely theoretical models .",
    "nesvorn@xmath10 et al .",
    "performed the simulation of gravitational collapse of small planetesimals . except for this work , no self - consistent numerical study of formation process of binaries in the tno region is reported so far .",
    "kominami et al .",
    "( 2011 ) performed @xmath0-body simulation of disks of equal - mass planetesimals at 30 au in order to see if the binary formation is a natural outcome in the tno region .",
    "they systematically changed @xmath11 ( @xmath12 being the physical radius ) , and the number density of planetesimals to study the effect of the binaries on the collision rate of planetesimals .",
    "they found that binaries are involved in 1/3 - 1/2 of all collisions , and that the collision rate is increased by about a factor of a few compared to the theoretical estimate for the direct two - body collisions . in the terrestrial planet region , binaries are less important , because the ratio @xmath13 is relatively small .",
    "direct two - body collisions take place instead of binary formation .",
    "although the duration of their simulations was short , they clearly demonstrated that the accretion process in the tno region is different from that in the terrestrial planet region .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the result of @xmath0-body simulations with realistic mass distributions of planetesimals .",
    "we show which part of the mass spectrum is affected by the formation of the binaries .",
    "we found that the binary fraction of the massive planetesimals is high , and that a significant fraction of collisions between large planetesimals is through binary - single body interactions .    in section 2 ,",
    "we explain the calculation method .",
    "section 3 gives the results .",
    "we discuss the increase of the accretion rate due to the binary formation in section 4 .",
    "the summary is given in section 5 .",
    "we consider the initial model which is consistent with the standard view of the collisional growth of the planetesimals .",
    "the distribution of planetesimal mass is a power - law and the random velocities of planetesimals are in the thermal equilibrium .",
    "we did not include the effect of the gas drag for simplicity .",
    "also , we assumed the simple perfect accretion model .",
    "thus , we effectively studied three - body formation , dynamical - friction model , chaos - assisted capture , but not models like giant impact or gravitational collapse .",
    "table 1 summarizes the initial conditions . in all runs ,",
    "the initial models are narrow rings .",
    "we studied models with four different values of the initial semi - major axis ( 1,3,10 and 30 ) .",
    "the mass distribution is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number density of planetesimal mass @xmath7 .",
    "the power index @xmath16 is about 2.5 after runaway growth ( kokubo and ida 1996 ) .",
    "since the mass distribution of tnos is not well understood , we adopt the above power index ( @xmath17 ) obtained in numerical simulations .",
    "the minimum and maximum mass , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are @xmath20 g and @xmath21 g , respectively .",
    "the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been fixed for simplicity .",
    "the observed tnos are about @xmath22 km in size . in order to keep the simulations feasible",
    ", we constrained the number of planetesimals and hence have to keep the planetesimal mass large .",
    "from theoretical point of view , growth timescale and other behavior would be the same if physical quantities are properly scaled with the hill radius .",
    "so we believe the relatively large mass used in our study does not cause serious problems . in order for the ring not to be too narrow , we set the planetesimals to be large as described .",
    "the number density used here is the value derived from the so - called minimum - mass solar nebula ( hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "the eccentricity and inclination of planetesimals are given by the maxwellian distribution .",
    "the initial rms eccentricity of planetesimals is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a parameter .",
    "we varied @xmath24 from 0.05 to 0.4 in order to study the effect of the initial velocity dispersion .",
    "for all models , we used @xmath25 ( ida and makino , 1992 ) .",
    "we create initial models so that there is no binary .",
    "the equation of motion of a planetesimal is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the heliocentric position vector , @xmath28 is the velocity vector , and @xmath29 is the mass of particle @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the gravitational constant and the solar mass , respectively .",
    "the first and second terms are the gravity of the sun and the mutual gravity between the particles , respectively .",
    "since the total mass of the planetesimals is @xmath33 , we neglect the indirect term .",
    "we use the 4th - order hermite scheme ( makino and aarseth 1992 , kokubo et al .",
    "1998 ) using individual time step with block step algorithm for orbital integration .",
    "the energy error was monitored in the simulations .",
    "the error was within @xmath34 level throughout the simulations .",
    "the mutual gravity term is calculated using grape - dr ( makino et al .",
    "the integration time is @xmath35 years .",
    "the number of binaries becomes roughly constant after several thousand years .",
    "we take into account the particle accretion following the treatment in the previous works ( e.g. , kokubo and ida 1996,1998 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we use the perfect accretion model , in which we let two planetesimals merge when the distance between them becomes less than the sum of their radii .",
    "when the binary induced collisions take place , the relative velocity of the components can be high enough to produce some fragmentation .",
    "this effect has not been considered yet , and should be discussed in future study .",
    "the physical radius of a planetesimal is determined by its mass @xmath7 and the density @xmath36 as @xmath37 we assume @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "the solid density of the planetesimals in the tno region is not well understood , and it might be more reasonable to use a smaller value .",
    "we adopted the typical density in the terrestrial region , which is not far from that of the observational value ( @xmath40 @xmath39 , e.g. grundy et al .",
    "2007 , johnston 2012 ) .      in this paper , we define a pair of planetesimals as binary , if their specific jacobi energy @xmath41 , defined as , @xmath42 under the hill approximation ( nakazawa and ida 1988 ) , is negative , where @xmath43 are relative cartesian coordinates of two planetesimals whose masses are @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the kepler angular velocity at the barycenter given as @xmath47 .",
    "when the distance between two planetesimals becomes smaller than the mutual hill radius,@xmath48 , we calculate @xmath41 . the mutual hill radius @xmath48 of @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the semi major axes of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "there are some pairs of which components orbit around each other but have positive @xmath41",
    ". however , the number of such pairs is negligible and they do not make substantial difference in the results .",
    "figure [ fig.30au_mass_ecc.new ] shows the evolution of the velocity dispersion for four runs : s30e0.05 , s30e0.1 , s30e0.2 and s30e0.4 .",
    "the plot with @xmath54 corresponds to the simulation result of s30e0.05 , @xmath55 corresponds to s30e0.1 , @xmath56 corresponds to s30e0.2 and @xmath57 corresponds to s30e0.4 .",
    "we can see that the velocity dispersion after @xmath58-@xmath35 years is pretty similar for all runs .",
    "the velocity dispersion is almost flat for @xmath59 g , then approaches to the thermal equilibrium of @xmath60 for larger mass .",
    "figure [ fig.mbin_30au.new ] shows the time evolution of the mean eccentricities for models s30e0.05 , s30e0.10 , s30e0.20 and s30e0.40",
    ". the mass range is divided into 5 bins with the same logarithmic width .",
    "the evolution of the eccentricity is quite similar for different mass bins after 100 - 1000 years , and reaches to similar values independent of initial values of @xmath24 after @xmath35 years .",
    "note that since the number of the planetesimals in the largest mass bin is small , there are some fluctuations , especially when @xmath24 is small .",
    "the velocity dispersion is far from the thermal equilibrium for the low - mass part .",
    "this is because the equipartition time scale is much longer than the heating time scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - mass end ( @xmath61 g ) is approximately in the equipartition , which means massive planetesimals have smaller random velocity .",
    "figure [ fig.mass.eta0.1.0.2.new ] shows the mass distributions at @xmath62 years and initial mass distribution for runs s30e0.10 and s30e0.20 , which are the realistic models in the sense that initial velocity dispersion is fairly high .",
    "when we compare the long dashed curve and short dashed curve , it is clear that the number of planetesimals with mass greater than @xmath63 g increases with time .",
    "as we will see in section 3.5 , most of the collisions after @xmath58 years are binary induced collisions .",
    "figure [ fig.bin1712 ] shows an example of the binary formation process in run s30e0.05 .",
    "first , blue and red dots approach to each other , and experience a close encounter .",
    "after the encounter , the red body becomes weakly bound to the black one .",
    "then third planetesimal ( magenta ) encounters with the red body and takes away some energy . as a result ,",
    "the red body becomes bound to the black body .",
    "this formation process is the three - body process discussed in goldreich et al .",

    "the difference is not so large , but if we compare the curves at @xmath58 and @xmath35 years , we can see that binary fraction shows some decrease in the low - mass side but essentially unchanged in the high - mass side .",
    "figure [ fig.nb_time_30au.new ] shows the time evolution of the number of binaries in runs s30e0.05 , s30e0.1 , s30e0.2 and s30e0.4 . in the runs with small @xmath24 ,",
    "many binaries are formed initially , when the velocity dispersion is low . in the case of run with @xmath57 ,",

    "the increase in the random velocity is very large for models with low initial eccentricity . in these models many very soft binaries",
    "are initially formed , and most of them were destroyed after the random velocity increased . in figure",
    "[ fig.bin_mass_30au.new ] , we can see that the large fraction of binary components are massive ( @xmath65 g ) at @xmath66 years . at @xmath67 years , @xmath3 10% of planetesimals in the highest mass bin are in binaries for all runs .",
    "this result shows that large planetesimals tend to form binaries , and once they are formed , they stay as binaries . in the runaway growth model ,",
    "the behavior of the massive bodies determine the evolution .",
    "since large planetesimals tend to form binaries , the accretion process can be significantly affected by the presence of binaries .",
    "although the number of collisions in the outer region is fewer than that in the inner region , a significant number of planetesimals experience collisions in runs s30e0.05 , s30e0.10 , s30e0.20 and s30e0.40 .",

    "first , two bodies become gravitationally bound through three - body interaction .",
    "then a third body perturbs their orbits and one of the components collide with the third body or with the other component .",
    "the number of such collisions is 103 in s30e0.05 , 71 in s30e0.10 , 26 in s30e0.20 and 11 in s30e0.40 .    in order to determine the type of a collision",
    ", we carried out the following procedure .",
    "we look at the snapshot @xmath68 years before the collision .",
    "first we check the jacobi energy of the colliding two bodies and see if it is negative .",
    "if so , we count them as a binary .",
    "if not , we look for the neighboring particles of the colliding particles . if we find a third body within the mutual hill radius of the colliding particles , we calculate the jacobi energy of the closest two bodies ( one of the colliding two and the third body ) . if the jacobi energy is negative , that collision is also counted as binary - induced collision",
    "the jacobi energy of the two particles is calculated using the position and the velocity vector .",
    "we checked if the colliding two bodies are really orbiting around each other at least several orbits .",
    "figure [ fig.coll_tmp2_alleta.new ] shows the mass distribution of particles participated in collisions in runs s30e0.05 , s30e0.10 , s30e0.20 and s30e0.40 .",
    "solid and dashed curves indicate binary - induced and non - binary - induced collisions , respectively . the slope of the mass distribution of collided planetesimals is shallower than that of the initial mass distribution",
    ". moreover , the slopes of the solid curves are somewhat shallower than that of the dashed curves , which means that the fraction of binary induced collisions over the total number of collisions is higher for larger planetesimals .    in figure [ fig.massdistalleta2.new2 ]",
    ", we show all collisions in runs s30e0.05 , s30e0.10 , s30e0.20 and s30e0.40 on the @xmath69-@xmath70 plane , where @xmath71 and @xmath70 are the mass of particles collided ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is clear that binary - induced collisions have systematically larger values of @xmath73 compared to non - binary - induced collisions . to see this tendency more quantitatively , we calculated average values of @xmath73 for massive and less massive primaries .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig.coll6_mass_bin ] . in the case of @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath73 is higher for larger @xmath71 in the case of binary - induced collisions , while it is lower for larger @xmath71 in the case of non - binary - induced collisions . though not this clear , similar tendency is visible for other values of @xmath24 , except for @xmath54 where the difference is small .",
    "since the number of collisions is similar for two types of collisions , this difference in the average mass of the secondary means that the growth of the mass of massive bodies comes primarily from binary - induced collisions . in other words , massive planetesimals in the tno region",
    "grow through binary - induced collisions , not through ordinary , non - binary induced collisions .",
    "figure [ fig.mass_bin_col ] shows the mass fraction of the binary - induced collisions over total collisions , as the function of the primary mass . for runs with large @xmath24(0.2 and 0.4 ) , we can see the tendency that the fraction of binary - induced collision is higher for larger @xmath71 .",
    "we can conclude that , for massive planetesimals , binary - induced collisions are frequent , and they are the main route of the growth of massive planetesimals .",
    "here we estimate the collision probability increase due to the formation of planetesimal binaries .",
    "let the binary induced collision probability to be @xmath74 , usual collision probability @xmath75 and the total collision probability be @xmath76 . from makino",
    "et al . ( 1998 ) , usual collision probability of @xmath7 and @xmath77 is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the scale height , @xmath80 is the physical radius of mass @xmath7 , @xmath81 is the escape velocity and @xmath82 is the relative velocity .",
    "the value @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is @xmath80 of the center of mass of @xmath7 and @xmath77 .",
    "hence , @xmath75 can be written as @xmath86 on the other hand , binary induced collision probability @xmath74 can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the typical semi major axis of binaries .",
    "we assume @xmath90 . here , @xmath91 is the probability of physical collision after a binary experienced close encounter with a third body .",
    "eq.([eq.pcolbin ] ) can be written as @xmath92 hence , from ( [ eq.pcol.bin2 ] ) and ( [ eq.pcol.ord2 ] ) we obtain @xmath93 let us assume @xmath90 , @xmath94 .",
    "also , if we assume @xmath95 and @xmath96 , eq([pratio ] ) becomes @xmath97 as shown in the previous section , when @xmath7 is large , @xmath98 .",
    "if we assume @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 thus , roughly speaking , the rate of binary - induced collision is comparable to that of non - binary induced collisions , in our model calculations . the enhancement of the growth rate due to the binary - induced collisions is larger for the following two reasons .",
    "first , as discussed in section 3.4 , the secondary mass is larger for the binary - induced collisions by a factor of three or around .",
    "this difference directly results in the increase of the growth rate by the same factor .",
    "second , in our simulations , the planetesimals tend to spread out radially , since the width of the initial planetesimal ring is still rather narrow ( figure [ fig.run1614_new_eta0.05 ] ) . the surface density in the radial range of 30.0 - 30.2 au decreased by roughly a factor of two from the initial value ( figure [ fig.surface_density_0.05 ] ) , and the `` average '' density by roughly a factor of three",
    "thus , the total non - binary - induced collision rate should have decreased by factor between five and ten ( goodman and hut 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , the relative frequency of the binary - induced collision would be a few times higher than what is observed in our model , if the radial diffusion of planetesimals are suppressed .",
    "we carried out n - body simulations of planetary growth in the outer region of the disk in order to study the effect of binaries . planetesimals with realistic size distribution are considered .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .",
    "binaries are formed in the outer region of the disk .",
    "they are formed through three - body encounters .",
    "the random velocities of the planetesimals increase with time .",
    "planetesimals with large mass tend to become binary components .",
    "the binaries collide through three - body encounters with third bodies . compared to non - binary - induced collisions ,",
    "binary - induced collisions prefer massive primaries and very strongly prefer massive secondaries . as a result , the growth of planetesimals happens mainly through binary - induced collisions .",
    "we estimate that growth timescale can be reduced by a factor of five to ten , due to the formation of binaries .",
    "since the initial planetesimal rings we used are narrow , the planetesimals tend to spread out radially and the density decreases from the initial value",
    ". the collision rate and the binary formation rate decrease as well .",
    "the actual number of the binary formation rate and binary - induced collision rate could be several times higher if the reduction of the surface density is prevented .",
    "hence , the effect of the planetesimal binary formation onto the accretion rate of planetesimals should be significant in tno region .",
    "timescale for the formation of uranus and neptune might be reduced by this factor , when in situ formation is assumed .",
    "the mechanism we propose will help us to understand the formation of outer planets and large tnos .",

    "<S> many massive objects have been found in the outer region of the solar system . how they were formed and evolved </S>",
    "<S> has not been well understood , although there have been intensive studies on accretion process of terrestrial planets . </S>",
    "<S> one of the mysteries is the existence of binary planetesimals with near - equal mass components and highly eccentric orbits . </S>",
    "<S> these binary planetesimals are quite different from the satellites observed in the asteroid belt region . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the hill radius to the physical radius of the planetesimals is much larger for the outer region of the disk , compared to the inner region of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the hill radius increases with the semi major axis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , planetesimals in the outer region can form close and eccentric binaries , while those in the inner region would simply collide . in this paper , we carried out @xmath0-body simulations in different regions of the disk and studied if binaries form in the outer region of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we found that large planetesimals tend to form binaries . </S>",
    "<S> a significant fraction of large planetesimals are components of the binaries . </S>",
    "<S> planetesimals that become the components of binaries eventually collide with a third body , through three - body encounters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the existence of binaries can enhance the growth rate of planetesimals in the trans - neptunian object ( tno ) region . </S>"
