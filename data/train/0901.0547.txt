    "galaxies with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have become the centre of attention in extragalactic studies due to their star role in the galaxy formation scenario favoured today .",
    "they are a key ingredient in explaining several observational statistics on galaxy star formation rates , luminosities and colours ( see for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a number of phenomena related to agn are still unclear , including the origin of the agn dichotomy into `` radio loud '' ( rl ) and `` radio quiet '' ( rq ) types .",
    "rl agn are characterised by the presence of jets of relativistic plasma and/or associated large - scale radio lobes .",
    "relativistic jets emitting synchrotron radiation in the radio band are generated by the collimation of outflows from the innermost regions of accretion discs around black holes ( bhs ) , carrying away a large fraction of the available accretion power .",
    "however , the jet production mechanism is not fully understood . the double - lobed morphology @xcite class ii ( fr ii ) sources are the most common type observed in broad line emitting rl quasars .",
    "on the other hand , the lower luminosity fanaroff class i objects ( fri ) have very weak radio emitting ejecta and weak or no emission lines .",
    "the correlation between radio luminosity and line luminosity in @xmath2 \\,\\lambda 5007 $ ] is similar for both rl and rq agn @xcite .",
    "different criteria for the definition of radio loudness have been used , the most common being the ratio between radio - to - optical luminosity , @xmath3 @xcite , and the radio power @xcite . a third criterion based on the classical radio morphology",
    "has also been considered @xcite . from the combination of the two latter criteria ,",
    "@xcite find that the boundary between rl and rq agn is given by @xmath4 , which corresponds to the luminosity of the weakest frii sources .",
    "using this luminosity threshold , they obtain a fraction of @xmath5 per cent of rl agn relative to the total population of agn .",
    "the presence of a physical bimodality in the properties of agn is still a matter of debate , and it should be borne in mind that observational selections might actually induce this dichotomy ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the host galaxies of both rl and rq qsos with nuclear luminosities @xmath6 are massive ellipticals ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; disc - dominated host galaxies become increasingly rare as the nuclear power increases .",
    "sikora , stawarz & lasota ( 2007 ) demonstrate that radio - selected agn hosted by giant ellipticals can be up to a thousand times brighter in radio frequencies than agn hosted by disc galaxies , thus generating two sequences in the radio versus optical luminosity plane .",
    "these rl and rq sequences remain present when considering the dependence of the radio loudness @xmath3 with the eddington ratio , where the latter is defined as the bolometric luminosity ( estimated from optical data ) in units of the eddington luminosity .",
    "the two sequences show an increase of radio loudness with decreasing eddington ratio .",
    "this bimodality breaks down at high accretion rates .",
    "this behaviour was originally noticed by @xcite , although only a single sequence was visible as a consequence of the reduced sample of agn considered .",
    "the link between jet production and gas accretion rate onto the bh has been widely investigated .",
    "the inner part of the accretion flow is believed to be responsible for the observed hard x - ray emission produced by compton scattering or bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "thus , observations of the compact emission in the x - ray and radio bands help understand the disc - jet connection in both stellar and supermassive bhs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , under the assumption that the jet formation process is qualitatively similar on both scales . observations of black hole binary systems during the low / hard x - ray state reveal a tight correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosity @xcite , supporting the dependence of the radio power on the accretion rate .",
    "this `` acretion paradigm '' postulates that radio loudness is entirely related to the states of accretion discs .",
    "however , it can not explain the two parallel sequences agn occupy in the plane defined by radio loudness and eddington ratio , as found by @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible that additional bh properties could be playing an important role in driving the production of powerful relativistic radio jets .",
    "the rl and rq sequences found by @xcite are characterised by agn containing bhs with masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "nonetheless , the bh mass is not capable of separating completely these two sequences , since objects powered by equally massive bhs can differ in radio luminosity by @xmath9 orders of magnitude ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite introduces a new parameter suggesting that the efficiency of jet production is determined by the dimensionless bh spin , according to the assumption that relativistic jets are powered by rotating bhs through the blandford - znajek mechanism . in an attempt to explain this radio power dichotomy at fixed accretion rates , @xcite propose a revised version of the `` spin paradigm '' which suggests that giant elliptical galaxies host , on average , bhs with larger spins than those hosted by spiral galaxies .",
    "these new insights inferred from observational evidences motivated the study of the influence from bh mergers and small accretion episodes on the evolution of bh spins and their relation to the morphology of the host galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these theoretical works indicate that it is feasible that the observed morphology - related bimodality of agn radio loudness arises from the dichotomy shown by the distribution of bh spins .    in this paper , we investigate the latter possibility by using the sag ( acronym for ` semi - analytic galaxies ' ) semi - analytic model of galaxy formation by lagos , cora & padilla ( 2008 , hereafter lcp08 ) , combined with the outputs of a cosmological simulation based on the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "the advantage of this approach relies in that we are able to use realistic bh growth histories directly linked to the evolution of the star formation rate of their host galaxies .",
    "the sag model also allows us to evaluate the influence of the different mechanisms that contribute to the accretion of material onto the bhs , which drive both the bh mass growth and the bh spin development .",
    "this work is organised as follows . in section  [ modeltot ] , we briefly summarise the mechanisms that contribute to the bh growth included in sag , and describe in detail the implementation of the bh spin model . in section",
    "[ nature ] , we discuss the connection between the bh spin distributions and the characteristics of the bh host galaxies . section  [ growth ] shows the results on the final bh spin and the way in which it is acquired . in section  [ radioloud ] , we analyse the nature of agn radio loudness and compare our results with available observational data .",
    "finally , the main conclusions obtained in this work are summarised in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we study the relationship between the bh spin and the properties of the bh host galaxy using a combination of a cosmological _ n_-body simulation of the concordance @xmath0cdm universe and the sag semi - analytic model of galaxy formation described in lcp08 .",
    "this model considers radiative cooling of hot gas , star formation , galaxy mergers , disc instabilities , feedback from supernova explosions , bh growth and agn feedback produced during accretion onto bhs driven by gas cooling processes .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we briefly describe the @xmath10-body cosmological simulation and the bh growth model used in sag , relevant for the present study .",
    "we then explain in detail the implementation of the model to compute the bh spin .",
    "the cosmological simulation is the same as the one used by lcp08 , based on the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "it considers a periodic box of @xmath11 containing @xmath12 dark matter particles with mass @xmath13 .",
    "it has more than @xmath14 dark matter haloes with masses of up to @xmath15 .",
    "the simulation parameters are consistent with the results of wmap data @xcite , with @xmath16 ( with a baryon fraction of @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the hubble constant is set to @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , and the gravitational softening length is @xmath22 .",
    "the simulation starts from a redshift @xmath23 and has been run using the public version of the gadget-2 code @xcite .",
    "there are three distinct modes of bh growth in sag .",
    "the first one , referred to as the `` qso mode '' , is associated to starbursts in galaxies .",
    "these events can be driven by galaxy minor or major mergers and the collapse of unstable discs .",
    "the second one , referred to as the `` radio mode '' , is associated to gas cooling processes that produce star formation in a more quiescent way .",
    "the third one is bh mergers which occur shortly after the merger of the parent galaxies . in our model ,",
    "agn feedback occurs only during the latter mode which produces low accretion rates , in agreement with observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed assumptions for each mechanism are given in lcp08 .",
    "here , we briefly describe the main formulae involved .    during galaxy mergers ,",
    "the bh growth depends on the ratio between total galaxy mass and the amount of available cold gas ( @xcite , lcp08 ) as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the cold gas mass of the system , consisting of the central and satellite galaxies , with masses ( including stellar and cold gas mass ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ; @xmath28 is the timescale between consecutive sag timesteps .",
    "black holes are assumed to grow with an efficiency @xmath29 , set to fit the @xmath30-@xmath31 relation . for disc instabilities ,",
    "the ratio @xmath32 is replaced by unity , since this process depends on the properties of a single galaxy .",
    "it is important to note that there are no bh seeds in our model and , therefore , the birth of central supermassive bhs is triggered when galaxies undergo their first starburst at some point in their evolution .",
    "the accretion rate during the `` radio mode '' is given by @xmath33 where @xmath30 is the bh mass , and @xmath34 is the fraction of the total halo mass in the form of hot gas , @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the virial mass of the host halo which has a virial velocity @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is a free parameter set to fit the galaxy and qso luminosity functions with a value @xmath39 .",
    "irrespective of the accretion mode , the bh produces a luminosity that corresponds to the total release of energy from the disc formed by gas accretion .",
    "this luminosity is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the speed of light , and @xmath42 is the standard efficiency of energy production that occurs in the vicinity of the event horizon ( @xcite , ss73 hereafter ) .",
    "our implementation of a bh spin model in sag follows the same methodology adopted for all the galaxy properties considered in the semi - analytic model , which consists in solving a set of linearised differential equations .",
    "the bh spin in each galaxy is followed through the evolutionary history of the simulated universe , allowing us to analyse the way in which the bh spin is acquired for every host galaxy and to study directly the role and influence of the hierarchical build - up of structure in the development of this bh property . during galaxy mergers ,",
    "the two central supermassive bhs are also merged ; we simply consider that the mass of the final bh is the sum of the merging bh masses ; the resulting spin is calculated using the semi - analytic fitting formulae presented by @xcite to fit a complete compilation of numerical results on bh mergers .",
    "the other processes involved in the bh growth feed baryons through the formation of accretion discs .",
    "the treatment of the angular momentum transfer from the accretion disc to the bh requires the following analysis .",
    "the dimensionless bh spin is defined as  @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the angular momentum of the bh . in general",
    ", @xmath45 refers to the absolute value of the angular momentum , @xmath46 .",
    "we consider the presence of a warped disc characterised by the angular momentum of the accretion disc at the warp radius , @xmath47 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the amount @xmath48 can be used to define the alignment between the spinning bh and the accretion disc ( @xcite , hereafter k05 ) .",
    "angular momentum vectors are co - aligned when @xmath49 , being @xmath50 the angle between the disc angular momentum and the bh spin ; otherwise , the accretion disc is counter - aligned with the bh spin .",
    "we use this criterion to evaluate the bh spin - up or down in the presence of a warped disc .",
    "sag does not assume an initial mass for bhs , or bh seeds ; instead , the first starburst in a galaxy , that occurs during galaxy mergers or disc instabilities , creates the central bh .",
    "these processes would therefore be in line with an origin of super - massive bhs as remnants of the first events of stellar explosions early in the history of the universe ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) . given this possible stellar origin of the bhs , it is reasonable to expect their initial spin to be non - zero .",
    "however , for the sake of completeness we also study the effect of initially spinless bhs , which could be formed by rapid collapse of infalling gas ( see for instance @xcite ) . in this latter case ,",
    "bhs acquire spin for the first time during their first accretion episode or merger with other black hole . in the case of an accretion event ,",
    "the resulting spin is given by the formalism developed by @xcite .",
    "when two spinless bhs merge , we use the analytic formula given by @xcite ; when at least one merging bh has a non - zero spin , the resulting spin is calculated using the semi - analytic fitting formulae presented by @xcite to fit a complete compilation of numerical results on bh mergers .     in the case of bhs with non - zero spin ,",
    "we calculate @xmath51 taking into account the mass of the accretion disc , @xmath52 , and the remaining properties related to the bh , @xmath30 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; all these quantities are provided by the sag model .",
    "the ratio between the angular momentum of the accretion disc and the bh spin is expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath57 comes either from equation  [ massqsomode ] or  [ massradio ] .",
    "accretion discs are completely consumed in the time interval @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 is the warp radius expressed in terms of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath59 ; in a ss73 middle - region disc , this ratio can be written as @xmath60 ( e.g. k05 , @xcite ) , where @xmath61 , being @xmath62 the eddington luminosity , @xmath63 the warp propagation viscosity , and @xmath64 the accretion driving viscosity ( @xmath63 can be different from @xmath64 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 , introduced by ss73 , takes into account the efficiency of the mechanism of angular momentum transport .",
    "a thin accretion disc is characterised by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the disc thickness and radius , respectively . in this case",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath68 @xcite . nonetheless , at high accretion rates ( i.e. hot / thick accretion discs ) there are indications that @xmath69 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on these theoretical and observational indications , we adopt simple criteria to distinguish between thin and thick accretion discs and , therefore , to choose an appropriate value for @xmath1 :    * _ thick accretion disc _",
    ": if the accretion occurs at super - eddington rates , that is @xmath70 , the accretion proceeds via a radiation pressure supported thick disc with @xmath71 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , which implies @xmath72 ( e.g. @xcite ) and @xmath69 ( e.g. @xcite ) . *",
    "_ thin accretion disc _ :",
    "if the accretion occurs in the regime of @xmath73 , it is assumed that @xmath74 .    in order to test the reliability of our results ,",
    "we adopt different values of the parameter @xmath1 , ranging from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , for the thick disc , and from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , for the thin disc .",
    "it is important to remark that the distinction between thick and thin discs has a direct consequence on the amount of angular momentum per unit mass transferred from the accretion disc to the bh , for the same disc mass .",
    "this arises from the dependence of equation [ e2 ] on the parameter @xmath1 , and the viscosities @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "this is a simplified approach to more sophisticated models which emphasize the importance of the disc thickness ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are a number of works that study in detail the possibility of alignments between galactic - scale structures and the central bh - disc system .",
    "@xcite find indications of co - alignment between the bh spin and large - scale gas flows coming from galaxy mergers .",
    "also , @xcite show that the jet direction is set by the bh angular momentum .",
    "these results indicate a possible co - alignment between the jet direction and the angular momentum of the accretion disc of the host galaxy , also supported by observations of high redshift radio galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite show that high spin values are efficiently achieved by a model with non - chaotic accretion episodes , that could explain the very large spin @xmath79 of the case of mcg-06 - 30 - 15 @xcite .",
    "these arguments make it relevant to consider the possibility that the direction of the angular momentum of the accretion disc is related to the physical process that triggers the gas accretion .",
    "we test this possibility using the information provided by our model as follows .",
    "when the accretion is driven by disc instabilities , we assume that the direction of the accretion disc can be inferred from the angular momentum @xmath80 of the galaxy disc ,    @xmath81    on the other hand , if the accretion is driven by gas cooling , we assume that the direction will be that of the angular momentum of the host halo ,    @xmath82    if the gas accretion is driven by galaxy mergers , the direction is taken from the gas mass - weighted disc angular momentum contributed by each galaxy ,    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the cold gas mass of the central and satellite galaxies , respectively . having the information on @xmath86 , we determine the co-(counter-)alignment according to the k05 criteria to finally sum ( subtract ) @xmath51 to @xmath44 .",
    "since a @xmath0cdm universe is characterised by strong co - alignments between the angular momentum of dark - matter haloes and their surrounding structures on scales of several mpc ( @xcite ) , there could be some level of alignment between the bh spin and the large - scale structure . in order to explore this ,",
    "the initial angular momentum of the gaseous disc of our model galaxies are inferred from that of their host dark - matter haloes .",
    "then , the angular momentum of model galaxies is followed and updated at every star formation episode , which can introduce some degree of misalignment with that of the hosting haloes . in the case of gas cooling processes",
    ", we consider that the cooled gas added to the galaxy disc drags the angular momentum of the host halo @xcite , modifying the pre - existing angular momentum of the galaxy disc . during mergers and disc instabilities ,",
    "the contributions from the participating gas and stellar components are taken into account to obtain the resulting galaxy angular momenta .",
    "we also consider randomly oriented accretion events ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) in order to study the main consequences arising from these two possible scenarios .",
    "we also analyse the results obtained from a model where the timescale for disc warping is much longer than for gas accretion . in this case , we ignore the k05 alignment criterion and the angular momentum of the disc is simply vectorially added to the bh spin . in all cases , the final bh spin direction will be that of the total angular momentum of the system ( bh and accretion disc ) which is assumed to be conserved .",
    "this assumption is not fully accurate since the torque exerted by the accretion disc acting over the total angular momentum of the system may be important ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since we are not considering angular momentum losses by torques , our estimates of the values of bh spins are upper limits . in case that the spin takes unphysical values (  @xmath87 )",
    ", we simply set them to  @xmath88 .",
    "however , when the resulting spin values are more than half a decade larger than unity , we also reduce the gas accretion onto the bh consistently with this new upper limit .",
    "we find that adopting values of @xmath89 for thick discs and @xmath90 for thin discs , only @xmath91 per cent of all accretion events in our model produces values of @xmath92 ( only @xmath93 per cent yields @xmath94 ) .",
    "lower values of @xmath1 produce higher percentages of unphysical spin values , as can be inferred from equations [ e1 ] and [ e2 ] .",
    "therefore , our choice of @xmath1 produces a minimum bias on the resulting spin distributions ( a high concentration at @xmath95 would spuriously hide information on the high tail of the bh spin distribution ) .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in our spin model lies on the initial value of the bh spin when considering their possible stellar origin , for which we test two possibilities , ( i ) a constant initial value ( from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ) , and ( ii ) an initial value proportional to the bh mass . as we will show in section  [ nature ] , the choice of the initial spin value does not affect our results significantly .",
    "moreover , the general conclusions of this work are preserved even for the case of spinless initial bhs .",
    "the most sensitive population to the inclusion of an initial bh spin are low - mass bhs ( i.e. @xmath98 ) since most of them have very few accretion episodes and practically no merger events during their entire lifetimes ; as a note of caution , we remind the reader that a null initial spin is not likely to occur in a bh with a stellar origin .    in the case",
    "when a bh is assigned an initial spin ( appart from a merger event ) the spin direction will depend on the process that triggers the bh birth .",
    "thus , the direction is given by ( i ) the angular momentum of the galaxy disc ( similar to eq .",
    "[ j1 ] ) , in the case of disc instabilities , and ( ii ) the angular momentum of the galaxy disc weighted by the gas mass of each merging galaxy ( similar to eq .  [ j2 ] ) , in the case of galaxy mergers",
    ". the final value of the spin will be only a function of the accretion and assembly history of the bh .",
    "this model provides a complete characterisation of a supermassive bh , giving information on both its mass and spin .",
    "these quantities strongly depend on the mass of cold gas accreted onto the bh .",
    "the great advantage of our model is that accretion discs are consistently given by our semianalytic model within a universe where structures grow hierarchically , instead of being obtained from the assumption of specific distributions of eddington accretion ratios as in other works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the redshift evolution of the accretion rate density onto a bh found by lcp08 ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) is consistent with the empirical estimations given by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the evolution of the qso luminosity function obtained from sag is in good agreement with observational results ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the resulting distributions of accretion disc masses and eddington rates are consistent with what was adopted in previous monte - carlo models .",
    "an important improvement presented by this model resides in the use of the known , vectorial angular momenta of the components of model galaxies to infer the direction of the angular momentum of the accretion disc .",
    "this depends on the physical process that triggers the accretion event , that is , gas cooling , disc instabilities , or galaxy mergers , as detailed above .",

    "however , the effect of not applying the criterion k05 has strong impact in model b , producing very low spin values in all populations ( i.e. accretion episodes randomly add / subtract angular momentum to the bh ) .     and the k05 alignment criterion .",
    "solid vertical lines indicate average values of the bh spin calculated from the distributions shown in each panel . for reference",
    ", we also show the average values obtained from model a without k05 ( dotted lines ) and model b with k05 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the dashed histogram shows the distributions of model a with k05 and initially spinless bhs.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    this morphology - related dichotomy also arises from the analysis of bh spin distributions as a function of the bh mass .",
    "[ hbh ] shows the resulting normalized distributions from model a with an initial bh spin @xmath116 and k05 alignments for four different bh mass ranges .",
    "the distributions are characterised by a progressive increase of the relative number of bhs with high spin values as we move to higher bh masses .",
    "this is clearly shown by the average values of bh spins represented by the vertical solid lines . taking into account that our model reproduces the well known bh - bulge mass relation ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the link between massive elliptical galaxies and high bh spins",
    "is also recovered ( see fig . [ spins ] ) .",
    "the similar average values denoted by solid ( model a with k05 ) and dotted ( model a without k05 ) lines support our previous conclusion about the minor influence of the k05 alignment criterion on the bh spins .",
    "although the average values from model b ( random angles with k05 ; dashed lines ) are different from those given by model a , the general behaviours of the average values are similar in both models .",
    "this is opposite to previous results by @xcite , where the most massive objects with bh spins obtained by considering random angles show the inverse trend .",
    "the distributions for model a with k05 and with a null initial bh spin are shown as dashed histograms and , as can be seen , there are little differences with respect to the non - zero spin case ( solid histogram ) , and the increase in the average spin value as a function of bh mass is also obtained .",
    "the three different scenarios explored here imply that massive ellipticals host more rapidly rotating bhs than spirals , as @xcite proposed in their revised version of the `` spin paradigm '' .",
    "this fact , together with the lack of a dependence of the @xmath102 bh spin distributions on their initial value , confirm that the accretion and assembly history almost entirely define the final bh spin value .",
    "this was suggested earlier by our analysis of the bh growth tracks ( fig .  [ tracks ] ) .",
    "this result is contrary to what is found from randomly oriented accretion discs , since in this case the final distribution retains the memory of its initial conditions , as has already been reported in previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also notice that the k05 criterion has a small impact on the final average value of the bh spin . in the following section we discuss into more detail the effects of considering k05 by using an individual example galaxy extracted from the model .",
    "in this section we present in detail the assessment of the contribution from each bh growth mechanism to the final spin value .",
    "we also evaluate the influence of assumptions regarding the accretion disc orientation and the effect of k05 alignments .",
    "[ con1 ] shows the contribution of each bh growth mechanism to the bh spin value at @xmath102 including mergers between bhs , and gas accretion driven by gas cooling processes , galaxy minor / major mergers , and disc instabilities in the host galaxy .",
    "the calculation of the contributions from each mechanism is explained in detail in section  [ model ] .",
    "the left panel shows the results obtained from model b with a constant initial bh spin @xmath101 and the k05 alignment criterion .",
    "we can see that the main spin - up mechanisms are disc instabilities and galaxy major mergers , the same processes that provide the main source of bh growth ( fig .",
    "@xmath117 in lcp08 ) .",
    "this result is not necessarily expected a priori since , in model b , the gas involved in minor and major mergers comes from different galaxies with random galaxy disc orientations , which may originate a misalignment of the accretion disc .",
    "note that gas cooling processes produce a minor average contribution throughout the whole bh spin range , mainly due to the low mass accretion rates during this process in addition to the random relative orientations , which result in roughly alternating additions and subtractions to the bh spin modulus .",
    "the other two plots of fig .",
    "[ con1 ] show results from model a , with and without considering k05 alignments ( middle and right panels , respectively ) . in both cases",
    ", we set a constant initial bh spin @xmath101 .",
    "we can see that , as in model b ( left panel ) , disc instabilities are also one of the main spin - up mechanisms . however , the main difference with respect to the case of randomly oriented accretion discs is the important influence gained by gas cooling processes .",
    "the contribution of minor mergers also becomes more important than in model b , being comparable to that of major mergers .    these results can be understood recalling that , during galaxy mergers , the angular momentum of the accretion disc arises as a result of the contribution from the gas mass - weighted angular momenta of the merging galaxies , while in self - interaction processes , like gas cooling and disc instabilities , the accretion disc simply takes the direction of the host halo angular momentum or the galaxy disc , respectively .",
    "this indicates that , at high redshifts , the first non - aligned accretion discs are likely to come from galaxy mergers . taking into account the comparable influence of disc instabilities and gas cooling processes on the results of model a , our conclusions on the development of the bh spin based on this model would not be strongly affected by the current modeling of disc instabilities , which is a simplified version of the actual process taking place in real galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily true for model b , where disc instabilities are major contributors to the bh spin .",
    "finally , mergers between bhs make a low relative contributions to the final value of the bh spin in all the three cases analysed .",
    "this is in agreement with previous works that indicate that high spins are achieved by accretion of baryonic matter rather than by mergers between bhs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that the relative importance of each growth mechanism is not affected by changes in the initial bh spin values tested in this work .",
    "these results are only slightly modified when k05 alignments are not used , in which case the angular momentum of the disc is simply vectorially added to the bh spin without considering alignments ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ con1 ] ) . in this case ,",
    "gas cooling processes and disc instabilities contribute to the bh spin in a rather similar way to the case where the k05 criterion is considered .",
    "this indicates that the angular momentum of accretion discs is mainly distributed within narrow cones around the bh spin direction , implying a slightly increased final spin value for a model with k05 . in the more rare case of counter - alignments",
    ", the accretion episodes can also produce more important spin - down effects .    regarding the effect of k05 alignments , we focus on an individual case in order to illustrate its effect on the bh spin development . fig .",
    "[ phidisk ] shows the evolution of several properties of the bh - disc system of one example galaxy taken from model a , with and without considering the k05 alignment criterion ( left and right panels , respectively ) .",
    "the upper panels show the relative contribution to the angular momentum of the bh , @xmath118 ( where @xmath119 is the angular momentum variation between consecutive snapshots of the underlying _",
    "n_-body simulation and @xmath120 ) , coming from accretion discs formed by the different gas accretion events ( see fig .",
    "[ con1 ] ) . in both cases , with and without k05 , some accretion episodes contribute to the bh angular momentum in amounts comparable or even higher than the current value of @xmath44 .",
    "the middle left panel shows the angle between the angular momentum of the accretion disc and the bh spin ; the middle right panel presents the variation in this angle arising from not including the k05 criterion .",
    "lower panels depict the mass accreted by the bh in each snapshot ( left - hand y - axis ) and the bh spin history ( right - hand y - axis ) .",
    "notice that the inclusion of k05 induces important changes in the details of the bh spin development .",
    "in particular , the accretion episodes that take place between @xmath121 do not change significantly the bh spin value when k05 is not applied , whereas when considering k05 the bh spin shows important variations .",
    "however , there is no final important net difference between these two models , since the sequence of accretion episodes that increase / decrease the bh spin almost cancel each other completely .",
    "note that applying k05 also has a small effect on the resulting angles between bh spins and the galaxy angular momenta , producing differences of less than @xmath122 degrees .",
    "finally , it is interesting to notice , by looking at the middle panels , that in @xmath123 per cent of the accretion episodes the angle between the angular momenta of the disc and the bh is @xmath124 degrees .",
    "our inclusion of accretion disc orientations arising from the lss , with or without k05 alignments , produces important changes in the contributions of different processes to the bh spin development , with respect to the results obtained using random orientations .",
    "this could have an important impact in our understanding of the connection between the bh spin and the luminous activity of agn .",
    "for instance , recent studies by @xcite show that rl qsos might be produced by recycled gas rather than mergers . in our model",
    ", these objects would be characterised by high spin values ( see for instance fig .",
    "[ con1 ] ) ; however , if we considered a monte - carlo model , these objects would probably show a low spin ( e.g. @xcite ) , leading to a completely different interpretation of the physical phenomenon at work .",
    "the results of our model have shown that the properties of black holes and their host galaxies are closely connected , in agreement with numerous observational and theoretical works on this subject .",
    "however , our model does not provide direct information on the radio loudness of the galaxy population . in an attempt to classify a galaxy as a radio - loud object ,",
    "we explore different possibilities using available properties of galaxies and their bhs provided by the model . among the most important quantities required to fully characterise the bh and its accretion disc are the way in which gas accretion proceeds ( extensively discussed in section  [ introsec ] ) , the bh mass , the bh spin , and the magnetic field .",
    "observational results indicate that the average bh mass in radio - loud systems is about twice as large as in radio - quiet galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . taking into account the well known relationship between bh and host bulge mass ,",
    "it is natural to extend the dependence of radio loudness to the stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "nonetheless , both populations of rl and rq qsos have been detected in massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) ; also , bhs of equal mass show differing radio luminosities by up to @xmath9 orders of magnitude ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it can be inferred that the influence of this bh property on the jet production , and the consequent strength of the radio emission , is secondary .",
    "other results in this direction are found by @xcite .",
    "the second parameter that may play a role in the rl / rq dichotomy is the amplitude of the local magnetic field from accretion flows which , in some cases , can produce large - scale fields that would help collimate strong relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "it has been argued , however , that the presence of such fields may not be of primary importance @xcite . in microquasars ,",
    "that share the same physical principles than agn on much smaller scales , it is possible that cold winds are responsible for the collimation of jets ( @xcite ) .",
    "this alternative further diminishes the potential relevance of magnetic fields as a primary collimation mechanism .",
    "the third physical property that can be linked to the radio loudness phenomenon is the bh spin as has been suggested by several authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a recent study by @xcite shows that the jet direction is influenced by the bh spin .",
    "therefore , in addition to the accretion rate , we consider the bh spin as another possible candidate to break the degeneracy between the rq and rl populations .    with these caveats in mind , we assume that radio loudness is defined by the bh spin , the gas accretion rate ( `` accretion paradigm '' ) , or combinations of both parameters ( as in the `` revised spin paradigm '' , @xcite ) .",
    "we evaluate the possibility that radio loudness is defined by these criteria using observational results on the fraction of radio - loud galaxies ( @xmath125 ) which is thought to increase with both , bh and stellar mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these relations are still a matter of debate , since it has been argued that they can simply be the result of observational biases ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , since there are no measurements of @xmath125 using complete samples of galaxies to date , we are limited to make qualitative comparisons to the observed data .",
    "the most complete study performed to date was presented by @xcite based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) but , even in this case , they only consider fr class 1 radio sources , characterised by low radio luminosities .",
    "we will attempt to distinguish between the predictions of models a and b by using only qualitative comparisons .    to this aim ,",
    "we focus on @xmath126 active galaxies ( i.e. with eddington ratios @xmath127 ) , and separate them into samples of model radio - loud galaxies ( mlr ) selected using different upper limits in accretion rates , @xmath128 , with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and three normalized minimum bh spin values , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we test whether these mrl samples are able to mimic the observed radio - loud population .",

    "the results for the full population of active galaxies are represented by a black dashed line .",
    "as can be seen , for model a , the limits on eddington ratios produce very similar fractions to what is obtained for the full agn sample , mostly due to the lack of bhs with high @xmath139 values at low redshift .",
    "the main features for samples limited by @xmath139 are an increasing @xmath136 with stellar mass for @xmath140 , with a plateau up to @xmath141 .",
    "stringent limits , @xmath142 , produce a decreasing @xmath136 at the high stellar mass end .",
    "however these limits are very restrictive since observed rl galaxies can show eddington ratios as large as @xmath143 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this aspect should be taken into account in order to test these particular predictions .",
    "these trends are at odds with the monotonically increasing observational relation mentioned above .",
    "there is little effect on these trends when considering the case of a null initial bh spin .    on the other hand , when considering thresholds on the bh spin alone , the fractions of mrl galaxies always increase with stellar mass .",
    "the results for the combined conditions , @xmath138 and @xmath144 , are only shown for @xmath145 and @xmath130 .",
    "these cases also show increasing relations between @xmath136 and stellar mass because of the strong influence of the limits on the bh spin .",
    "finally , for all the selection criteria analysed , model b ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ radiostellar ] ) , characterised by random orientations , fails to produce monotonically increasing fractions of mlr galaxies as a function of stellar mass .",

    "the same similarity between the dependences with bh and stellar mass arise for model b , with milder or negligible trends of the mrl fractions with bh mass .",
    "all the previous results correspond to the local universe . from our results on the development of bh spin",

    "[ phidisk ] ) , it is natural to expect smaller fractions @xmath136 at higher redshifts , particularly when using the bh spin as the main parameter to define radio - loudness .",
    "however , the fractions of active galaxies increase importantly at higher redshifts producing a combined effect .",
    "galaxies hosting bhs with masses @xmath146 lead to higher fractions @xmath136 with respect to those with bhs of the same mass in the local universe , while galaxies with bhs masses in the range @xmath147 show the expected decreased fractions .",
    "as the redshift increases the relation becomes steeper as a function of both bh and stellar mass .",
    "this prediction can be confirmed by further observations of high redshift radio - sources .",
    "we have combined two models for the orientation of accretion discs with three sets of criteria related to the accretion and spin paradigms , with the aim of isolating the main parameters that characterise the radio loudness of galaxies .",
    "our results indicate that the dependence of the fractions of mrl galaxies with bh and stellar mass are a qualitative match to the increasing trend showed by observational results when thresholds on the bh spin are applied .",
    "it is important to notice that this is more naturally achieved in a model with lss oriented accretion discs .",
    "the most important aspect to emphasize from our results is that this qualitative agreement preferentially favours the `` spin paradigm '' as the likely scenario for radio loudness in the universe .",
    "we remind the reader that the observed trend is still in debate . therefore",
    ", further observational data on agn are required in order to reach a proper understanding of the biases involved in the measurements of fractions of rl galaxies .",

    "we have implemented a simple calculation of the bh spin in the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation described by lcp08 to study relationships between the bh spin , the bh mass and the host galaxy properties .",
    "the main advantage of using a semi - analytic model relies in the ability to follow , for the first time , the development of the bh spin from the contribution of different bh growth mechanisms , all immersed within a @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "such processes are gas cooling , disc instabilities , galaxy mergers and mergers between bhs .",
    "additionally , the model allows us to relate phenomena taking place at very small scales ( bh and accretion disc ) to those at larger scales ( galaxy discs ) ; we infer the orientation of the accretion disc using that of the source of accreted material ( referred to as model a ) .",
    "thus , the angular momentum of the host halo is used when the accretion is driven by gas cooling , while that of the galaxy disc is considered during disc instability events ; in the case of mergers , gas mass - weighted averages of the angular momentum of intervening galaxies are adopted .",
    "we also consider random accretion disc orientations ( model b ) , as has been adopted in several previous works ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main results and conclusions of this work are summarised as follows .",
    "* massive bulges , and therefore giant elliptical galaxies , host almost exclusively rapidly rotating bhs .",
    "although this effect is more pronounced in model a than in model b , in both models elliptical galaxies host , on average , bhs with higher spin values than spiral galaxies , in accordance with the revised `` spin paradigm '' proposed by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the morphology - related bimodality of radio loudness could be explained by the bh spin .",
    "* high mass bhs ( @xmath148 ) in model a , show little dependence on the initial bh spin assigned to them , indicating that their spin is almost entirely determined by the accretion history .",
    "additionally , including the k05 alignments of accretion discs only produces very mild changes in the final bh spin distribution .",
    "results from model b are found to be more dependent on the initial values of the bh spin and strongly dependent on whether the k05 alignment is applied or not . * for model a ,",
    "gas cooling processes and disc instabilities are the main contributors to the final bh spin .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that gas cooling processes produce very low relative accretion onto the bh . on the other hand , in model b ,",
    "the main mechanisms for bh spin - up are also those responsible for the highest accretion rates , namely , galaxy mergers and disc instabilities .",
    "this represents the main difference between the two schemes adopted for the orientation of accretion discs .",
    "* we use measurements of the dependence of the fraction of rl galaxies as a function of stellar and bh masses in order to test different parameter combinations to select a population of model galaxies representative of the observed rl galaxy population .",
    "these parameters are assumed to be the accretion rate and/or the bh spin .",
    "we test three different criteria , using ( i ) an upper limit on the eddington ratio ( `` accretion paradigm '' ) , ( ii ) a lower limit on the bh spin , and ( iii ) simultaneous limits on both quantities ( similar to the revised version of the `` spin paradigm '' ) . for model",
    "a , we find that criterion ( i ) predicts a roughly constant fraction of possible radio - loud galaxies as a function of bh and stellar mass ( for @xmath149 ) , while criterion ( ii ) produces a monotonically increasing relation .",
    "finally , criterion ( iii ) also produces an increasing relation , although mostly due to the strong influence of the limit on the bh spin . for model",
    "b , we find that none of the proposed criteria are able to produce an increasing fraction of radio - loud galaxies with either the stellar or bh mass . * taking into account recent observational results ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) reporting an increasing fraction of radio - loud galaxies with bh and stellar masses , we find that the most suitable paradigm to explain radio loudness is the `` spin paradigm '' @xcite .",
    "still , it should be taken into account that these measurements may be subject to observational biases ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the implementation of a bh spin model presented here can be used as a new tool to understand the role of different processes on both very large and very small scales , within an ab - initio model of galaxy formation . within our modeling",
    "we are able to reproduce results from monte - carlo attempts at describing bhs and the radio - loud galaxy population .",
    "our analysis also singles out possible systematic biases in the model predictions resulting from the use of random orientations for the accretion discs which continuously form around bhs .",
    "our finding of a possible influence of the lss alignments on the detailed spin - up history of bhs can now also be considered in simple models , and be studied into more detail .",

    "<S> we use a combination of a cosmological _ n_-body simulation of the concordance @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) paradigm and a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation to investigate the spin development of central supermassive black holes ( bhs ) and its relation to the bh host galaxy properties . in order to compute bh spins </S>",
    "<S> , we use the @xmath1 model of shakura & sunyaev and consider the king et al . warped disc alignment criterion . </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of the accretion disc is inferred from the angular momentum of the source of accreted material , which bears a close relationship to the large - scale structure in the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the final bh spin depends almost exclusively on the accretion history and only weakly on the warped disc alignment . </S>",
    "<S> the main mechanisms of bh spin - up are found to be gas cooling processes and disc instabilities , a result that is only partially compatible with monte - carlo models where the main spin - up mechanisms are major mergers and disc instabilities ; the latter results are reproduced when implementing randomly oriented accretion discs in our model . regarding the bh population , we find that more massive bhs , which are hosted by massive ellipticals , have higher spin values than less - massive bhs , hosted by spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse whether gas accretion rates and bh spins can be used as tracers of the radio loudness of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the current observational indications of an increasing trend of radio - loud agn fractions with stellar and bh mass can be easily obtained when placing lower limits on the bh spin , with a minimum influence from limits on the accretion rates ; a model with random accretion disc orientations is unable to reproduce this trend . </S>",
    "<S> our results favour a scenario where the bh spin is a key parameter to separate the radio - loud and radio - quiet galaxy populations .    </S>",
