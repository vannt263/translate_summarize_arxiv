    "in the last few decades , a primary goal of observational astronomy has been to gain more insight into stellar and planetary formation .",
    "brown dwarfs occupy the niche in the mass range between stars and planets .",
    "they form like stars , but do not have enough mass to sustain hydrogen fusion .",
    "the observational distinctions between a planet and brown dwarf have yet to be constructed .",
    "unfortunately , until just a few years ago , no unambiguous brown dwarfs were known .",
    "substellar objects cool indefinitely because they do not sustain hydrogen fusion and thus become fainter and more difficult to detect at older ages ( c.f .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "therefore , the young 10@xmath140 myr associations such as tw hydrae and tucana represent excellent targets for a search for brown dwarfs and massive planetary companions .    as part of a larger coronagraphic survey program ( lowrance et al .",
    "2001 ) , we surveyed 5 of the members of the tw hydrae association , including twa 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8b , and 10 as well as 2 members of the tucana association for possible brown dwarf companions , low - mass stellar companions , and dust debris disks ( see schneider et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; this volume ) .",
    "twa 8a was included in another nicmos imaging survey ( weintraub et al .",
    "all other twa members from webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) were close multiple systems and we did not observe these since other close companions can presumably be ruled out on dyanamical grounds .",
    "the main problem with trying to image brown dwarfs or giant planets around main - sequence stars is the overwhelming brightness of the primary . a substellar companion will be much fainter than the star it orbits ( i.e. a gl 229b - like object , l@xmath22@xmath3l@xmath4 , orbiting a solar - like star of 1 l@xmath4 ) .",
    "the cool brown dwarf makes up a little of this in the infrared , where it radiates most of its power , and is brighter with youth , but the primary is still much brighter .    to facilitate the removal of background light from the primary near the coronagraphic hole , we designed pairs of observations with different spacecraft orientations ( @xmath5 = 29.9 ) which",
    "could then be subtracted from one another to cancel scattered light .",
    "each observation was about 800s long split into 3 multi - accum ( non - destructive read ) sets ( see lowrance et al .",

    ", we plot the detection limits for the example of hd 202917 ( left ) and the limits overall ( right ) in the observations found from planting and recovering psf stars in the images . at 1@xmath6",
    ", we can detect a delta magnitude of 9.5 mag for all stars . for stars in the tucana and tw hya associations ,",
    "the average primary is h @xmath2 7 mag , and our average limit corresponds to m@xmath7 = 13.6 mag at 50 au ( median distance is 50 pc ) .",
    "as these stars are very young ( 1040 myr ) , the detection limit is @xmath85 , based on the models of burrows ( pers comm ) . even at 0.5@xmath6",
    ", we can detect a delta magnitude of 68 mag , a full 24 mag better than most speckle imaging programs .    in table 1",
    "we present the results of the coronagraphic survey .",
    "` stellar - like ' candidates are those that have a fwhm between 0.14 and 0.18@xmath6 , the brighter of which show an airy diffraction pattern .",

    "the twa 5 system was observed several times in the last two years  with nic 1 ( weintraub et al .",

    "( 2000 ) as the triangle in figure 3(b ) . from these observations , we plot the change in measured separation of the a and b components at each epoch and compare them with the expected change in separation for a background object .",
    "we conclude both twa 5b and hr 7329b are true proper motion companions to their primaries .",
    "the companions to twa 5a and hr 7329b were placed in the slit of the stis by centering the primary and offsetting to the companion by the nicmos - measured astrometry ( lowrance et al .",

    "spectral imaging sequences were completed in one orbit with the g750 m grating .",
    "the stis spectra of twa 5b and hr 7329b were fit to template m dwarf spectra ( figure 2 ) , and classified as m9 @xmath11 0.5 for twa 5b and m7.5 @xmath11 0.5 for hr 7329b . for twa 5b",
    ", this is consistent with the photometric spectral type of m8-m8.5v derived by lowrance et al . ( 1999 ) and more recent results by neuhauser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    using the temperatures derived from the spectral types and absolute h magnitudes which assume the same distance as the primary",
    ", we place these two objects on evolutionary diagrams of baraffe et al .",

    "twa 5b is consistent with a 20  object at an age of 10 myr old , which is the approximate age of the tw hydra association .",

    "a point - source was discovered at a separation of 2.549@xmath6 @xmath11 0.011 , and a position angle of -278.7@xmath12 @xmath11 0.2 from twa 6 ( twa 6a ) .",
    "the h magnitude of twa 6b is 19.93 @xmath11 0.08 mag .",
    "the field of twa 6 was reobserved with the nicmos 1 camera with a medium - band f090 m filter ( central wavelength : 0.9003  @xmath13 m , @xmath14 = 0.1885  @xmath13 m ) and twa 6b was not detected .",
    "we derive an upper limit ( 3@xmath15 ) to the flux of [ f090m]=22.6 mag in the predicted position from the nicmos images . using low - temperature models to transform between f090 m and i - band",
    ", we calculate an upper limit of i@xmath1h@xmath03.3 for the candidate companion .",
    "the color is equivalent to a spectral type later than m7v ( kirkpatrick & mccarthy 1994 ) , so we conclude that the object is very red , even if it is not associated with twa 6a .",
    "a background k giant would have an i@xmath1h @xmath9 2 mag , which would have been easily detected in the nic 1 images .",
    "if associated with twa 6a at 50 pc , this object would have an absolute magnitude , m@xmath7=15.8 , which corresponds to a @xmath8 2  object at 125au ( burrows , a. pers comm ) .",
    "re - observations of twa 6 are underway with the keck ao system ( macintosh et al , this volume ) .",
    "such astrometric measures are difficult with the current two year baseline , but high resolution observations are needed to establish if twa 6b is a young jovian planet .",
    "with the nicmos camera and the coronagraph , we have studied the environments of close to half of the young stars of the tw hydrae association and two of the tucana association . around four of these stars we found point - like objects which were possible companions . after careful analysis and more observations , we find that twa 5b is a @xmath8 20  brown dwarf , hr 7329b is a @xmath8 40  brown dwarf and twa 7b is a background object .",
    "we find no candidate companions around hd 202917 , twa 1 , twa 8b , or twa 10 greater than a few , based on models of giant planets , at 1@xmath6 , or 50 au at the distance of the stars .",
    "a faint , point - like object 2.5@xmath6 from twa 6 remains a mystery , though .",
    "it has the potential to be the most significant discovery of this program as the first giant planet imaged around another star ."
