    "nonlinear oscillator systems are ubiquitous and they model numerous physical phenomena ranging from atmospheric physics , condensed matter , nonlinear optics to electronics , plasma physics , biophysics , evolutionary biology , etc . @xcite .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of nonlinear oscillations is the amplitude or initial condition dependence of frequency for nonisolated periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "for example , for the cubic anharmonic oscillator @xmath3 where dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath4 , the general ( periodic ) solution is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants with the modulus squared of the jacobian elliptic function @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . in the case of limit cycle oscillations the dependence of the initial condition is manifested in the form of suitable transient time to reach the asymptotic state . for chaotic oscillations , of course",
    ", there is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions . in this paper",
    "we identify a physically interesting and simple nonlinear oscillator of the linard type , which is also a generalized emden type equation , that admits for a particular sign of the control parameter nonisolated conservative periodic oscillations , exhibiting the remarkable fact that the frequency of oscillation is completely independent of amplitude and remains the same as that of the linear harmonic oscillator , thereby showing that the amplitude dependence of frequency is not necessarily a fundamental property of nonlinear dynamical phenomena .",
    "we also show that rewriting the underlying equation of motion as a system of two first order coupled nonlinear differential equations the basic criterion for conservative system in terms of the divergence of the flow function has to be generalized .",
    "we consider a nonlinear oscillator system of the form @xmath10 which is of the linard type @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the present case .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) can also be interpreted as the cubic anharmonic oscillator defined by eq .",
    "( [ lam100 ] ) ( with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , but acted upon on by a strong damping type nonlinear force @xmath16 .",
    "this type of equation is also well studied in the literature for almost two decades as a generalized form of emden type equation occurring in the study of equilibrium configurations of a spherical cloud acting under the mutual attraction of its molecules and subject to the laws of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) is a special case of a general second order nonlinear differential equation possessing eight lie point symmetries @xcite and that it is linearizable . in particular the special case",
    "@xmath17 has been well analyzed by mahomed and leach @xcite and explicit forms of the eight symmetry generators satisfying @xmath18 algebra have been well documented .",
    "the latter case @xmath19 has the exact general solution @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the two integrals of motion with the explicit forms    @xmath23    [ lam103 ]    obviously for @xmath17 case the initial value problem of eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) appears to be a dissipative nonlinear system .",
    "in the following we show that the nonlinear oscillator equation ( [ lam101 ] ) possesses several unusual and interesting features , which are contrary to the standard characteristic features associated with usual nonlinear oscillators .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath1 we prove that the system ( [ lam101 ] ) possesses oscillatory motion whose frequency is completely independent of the amplitude .",
    "thus we prove that the standard notion of _ amplitude dependent frequency of oscillations is not a necessary condition for nonlinear oscillators_. moreover , we also point out that the system ( [ lam101 ] ) admits a lagrangian formulation and from which a conservative hamiltonian can be obtained . further , we also find that the standard test ( divergence of the flow function ) to identify whether the given system is conservative or not fails here .",
    "to overcome this situation we propose that the necessary condition for a system to be a conserved hamiltonian is that the time average of the divergence of the flow function should vanish instead of the flow function itself vanishing .",
    "more interestingly , we also find that the system ( [ lam101 ] ) when @xmath2 also admits a lagrangian as well as a conserved hamiltonian description similar to the case @xmath1 , eventhough the general solution shows a dissipative / damping / frontlike aperiodic structure , depending on the initial condition .",
    "the divergence of the flow function for the case @xmath2 can be negative for all times in spite the conserved hamiltonian nature . again to redeem the situation , one requires the time average of the divergence of the flow function to be vanishing .",
    "finally , we also point out that the special features of the system can be traced to the existence of certain linearizing and canonical and nonlocal transformations , which points out to generalization of the results in different directions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the following section , we utilize the so called modified prelle - singer procedure and derive two functionally independent integrals of motion for the eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we show that for the case @xmath1 the system ( [ lam101 ] ) admits periodic solutions and construct the associated lagrangian as well as hamiltonian for this system .",
    "we discuss the unusual features associated with the system in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] and point out the amplitude independence of the frequency of oscillations as well as the nonzero value of the divergence of the flow function in spite of its conservative nature .",
    "we analyse the nature of solutions in the regimes @xmath17 and @xmath24 in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] and point out that in spite of the decaying / damping nature or frontlike aperiodic nature of the solutions , the system admits lagrangian and hamiltonian descriptions . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , we linearize the eq .",

    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "now let us consider the general case @xmath25 .",
    "one can proceed to solve the equation explicitly by the so called modified prelle - singer ( p - s ) method @xcite which identifies the integrals of motion and explicit solution , if they exist .",

    "( [ met11 ] ) , namely ,    @xmath46    consequently , substituting @xmath35 and @xmath42 in ( [ met13 ] ) , we find the two ( time dependent ) integrals of motions for eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) as    @xmath47    [ lam117 ]",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) admits two different kinds of dynamics depending on the sign of the parameter @xmath48 . in this section",
    "we discuss the case @xmath1 .",
    "now we note that for @xmath1 both the integrals @xmath21 and @xmath22 become complex . to identify two real integrals , we consider the combinations @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 so that @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be taken as the two real integrals of eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) for @xmath1 . in eq .",
    "( [ lam119 ] ) , @xmath7 is a phase constant .",
    "thus for the case @xmath1 , the integrals ( [ lam118 ] ) and ( [ lam119 ] ) lead to the explicit sinusoidal periodic solution ( fig .",

    "the form of the first integral ( [ lam118 ] ) also establishes that the system is of conservative type .",
    "note that in ( [ lam120 ] ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 so that @xmath58 and @xmath59 may be called as the amplitude of oscillations in the present case . also for @xmath60 , the solution ( [ lam120 ] ) becomes singular at finite times .    ) ) with frequency same as that of the linear harmonic oscillator . ]    ) for @xmath61 : ( a ) @xmath62 plane , ( b ) @xmath63 plane . ]      the form of the time independent first integral @xmath52 as given by eq .",
    "( [ lam118 ] ) suggests that one can indeed give a lagrangian and so a hamiltonian description for eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) when @xmath1 .",
    "indeed we identify a suitable lagrangian for the system ( [ lam101 ] ) as @xmath64 then the canonically conjugate momentum can be defined as @xmath65 consequently , one can obtain the hamiltonian associated with eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) as    @xmath66    [ lam123 ]    note that in the above expressions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we have kept certain prefactors and constant terms in order to have the correct limits for @xmath69 , namely the harmonic oscillator limit.the nature of the trajectories in the @xmath62 and @xmath63 planes are shown in figs .",
    "they form closed concentric curves in the region @xmath61 .",
    "finally we may point out that because of the form of the second and third terms in the right hand side of ( [ lam121 ] ) one may define a modified lagrangian    @xmath70    [ lam123a ]    which again correspond to the equation of motion ( [ lam101 ] ) , provided @xmath71 .",
    "however in the limit @xmath69 , in order to get the correct harmonic oscillator it is preferable to have the forms ( [ lam121])-([lam123 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the later forms ( [ lam123a ] ) have the advantage that they give interesting @xmath17 limit , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "consequently , we have chosen to present both the forms here .",
    "the remarkable features of the general solution ( [ lam120 ] ) are that the nonlinear system ( [ lam101 ] ) admits _ harmonic periodic solutions _ ( [ lam120 ] ) and that the _ frequency of these periodic oscillations _ , @xmath72 , _ is completely independent of the amplitude or initial condition _ , a feature which is generally quite uncommon for nonlinear oscillators of conservative type . the form of the solution is shown in fig .",
    "it may be noted that in the limiting case of vanishing nonlinearity , @xmath73 , one recovers the solution of the linear harmonic oscillator as it should be from eq .",
    "( [ lam120 ] ) and there is no change in the angular frequency @xmath50 even when @xmath71 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ lam120 ] ) .",
    "however , it may be noted that in the limit @xmath48 or @xmath74 , @xmath75 and so @xmath76 , the trivial solution to ( [ lam101 ] ) and not to the aperiodic bounded solution ( [ lam102 ] ) .",
    "thus at @xmath17 , a bifurcation occurs .      another interesting feature of eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) is that when written as a system of two first order equations , it takes the form    @xmath77    [ lam124 ]    for @xmath1 , it has one equilibrium point @xmath78 which is of centre type compatible with the occurrence of nonisolated periodic orbits .",
    "interestingly the conventional criterion for conservative systems ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) , namely , the value of the divergence of the flow function @xmath79 for eq .",
    "( [ lam124 ] ) vanish , fails here as @xmath80 .",
    "only the average of @xmath81 , namely @xmath82 on actual evaluation using the solution ( [ lam120 ] ) , vanishes .",
    "such a generalized criterion that the average of the flow function vanishes for a conservative system seems to be a necessary condition as the present example shows .",
    "in the previous section , we discussed the dynamics of ( [ lam101 ] ) for the case @xmath1 . in the following",
    "we explore the dynamics of the system ( [ lam101 ] ) with @xmath83 .    for @xmath24 , both the time - dependent integrals ( [ lam117 ] ) are real , from which the explicit solution can be obtained straightforwardly as @xmath84 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants .",
    "solution ( [ lam119a ] ) clearly shows the dissipative / damping / aperiodic nature of the system for @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) .",
    "we now note that system @xmath85 still admits the lagrangian and hamiltonian descriptions .",
    "in fact the lagrangian @xmath86 and the hamiltonian @xmath68 for the case @xmath1 , namely the forms ( [ lam121 ] ) and ( [ lam123 ] ) , respectively , are valid here also .",
    "the only difference here is that one has to replace @xmath48 with @xmath87 in the respective places in eqs .",
    "( [ lam121 ] ) and ( [ lam123 ] ) for the present case . on the other hand",
    "the forms ( [ lam123a ] ) are valid for @xmath1 as well as @xmath2 , though not valid in the limiting harmonic oscillator case @xmath88 .",
    "the major difference in the dynamics comes from the nature of the solution . in the present case it admits decaying type or aperiodic ( front like ) solutions only ,",
    "3 , where the time of decay or approach to asymptotic value is independent of the amplitude / initial value , which is once again an unusual feature for a nonlinear dynamical system .     for different initial conditions . ]",
    "the nontrivial general solution for the limiting case @xmath17 is given in eq .",
    "( [ lam102 ] ) . interestingly in this case",
    "also one can deduce a lagrangian and the associated hamiltonian , which ( from eqs .",
    "( [ lam123a ] ) ) turns out to be @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 the above form of lagrangian can also be deduced from the form ( [ lam121 ] ) , by taking the lagrangian for the limiting case @xmath17 as @xmath92 the expressions @xmath93 and @xmath68 given above can be obtained from this @xmath94 . the solution plot ( corresponding to solution ( [ lam102 ] ) )",
    "is given in fig .",
    "4 .    one can also calculate the flow function in the case @xmath2 . again from eq .",
    "( [ lam124 ] ) we find that the divergence of the flow function for @xmath2 is @xmath80 .",
    "but from the general expression for the solution , one can always choose @xmath95 for all finite @xmath4 .",
    "so one might conclude that the system is dissipative ( because @xmath96 ) inspite of its just proved conservative nature . in order to overcome this incompatibility , and noting that for the case @xmath24 , the dynamical variable @xmath97 asymptotically tends to a constant value @xmath98 , we again define the condition for conservative flow is that the time average of the divergence of the flow function with reference to the asymptotic @xmath99 value should vanish : @xmath100 dt = 0.\\label { lam01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the present cases , we have @xmath101 dt .",

    ". on the other hand for @xmath24 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 so that @xmath107 vanishes here also .     for different initial conditions . ]",
    "at this stage one may also try to trace the reason for the existence of the above type of remarkable oscillatory behaviour for eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) . under the transformation @xmath108 , eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) transforms to a linear third order differential equation , @xmath109 from which also one can trace the solution ( [ lam120 ] ) .",
    "further , it gets transformed into a free particle equation @xmath110 , where prime denotes differentiation with respect to a new variable @xmath111 , with the point transformation @xmath112 even then it is very unexpected and unusual to realize such nonlinear oscillator systems having simple properties similar to that of linear oscillators .",
    "in addition to the above , one can also linearize the equation ( [ lam101 ] ) through a nonlocal transformation , @xmath113 under this transformation eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) gets modifieed to the form of a linear harmonic oscillator equation , @xmath114 note that the above transformation ( [ lin02 ] ) is valid for all the three cases , namely , @xmath115 and @xmath24 . for @xmath1 , obviously the solution of ( [ lin03 ] ) is @xmath116 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants and frequency @xmath50 , which is independent of the amplitude .",
    "consequently , from the forms of the general solutions ( [ lin03a ] ) and ( [ lam120 ] ) we can identify the obvious canonical transformation @xmath117 where @xmath118 , so that using eq .",
    "( [ lam122 ] ) for the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath93 , we have @xmath119 it is straightforward to check that when @xmath120 and @xmath121 are canonical so do @xmath122 and @xmath93 ( and vice versa ) and that the hamiltonian @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ lam123 ] ) can be rewritten as the standard linear harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath123    more interestingly , even for @xmath24 , making use of similar argument for the aperiodic bounded solution ( [ lam119a ] ) , we can write the canonical transformation @xmath124 where @xmath118 , so that the hamiltonian ( [ lam123 ] ) ( for @xmath24 ) is mapped on to the unbounded ( wrong sign ) linear harmonic oscillator @xmath125    finally for the @xmath17 case , we can identify the canonical transformation @xmath126 so as to transform to a freely falling particle hamiltonian @xmath127 .",
    "however , we suspect that there may exist a canonical transformation for this specific case @xmath17 , which will take the corresponding form of eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) to a free particle , though we could not succeed to find it so far .",
    "of course , it is well known that linearization in general does not ensure preservation of properties of linear systems in the nonlinear case .",
    "the classical example is the cole - hopf transformation through which the nonlinear burgers equation is transformed into the linear heat equation @xcite .",
    "this is also true in the case of various soliton equations such as korteweg - de vries , sine - gorden , nonlinear schr@xmath128dinger and other equations which are all linearizable in certain sense .",
    "nevertheless in the present example of eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) , the amplitude independence of frequency does indeed get preserved .",
    "these considerations also raise the question of identifying the most general class of nonlinear dynamical systems of the form @xmath129 that has solutions whose frequency is independent of the amplitude as in the case of the linear harmonic oscillator , a point which is under study presently .",
    "we also observed that the above exceptional properties admitted by eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) is also common for a class of nonlinear systems .",
    "in particular we find that the modified emden type equation with linear term and constant external forcing @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are parameters , for which also one can obtain similar propertes as discussed above for eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) when the parameters satisfy the specific condition @xmath133 . to be specific , for the case @xmath134 , the explicit periodic solution takes the form @xmath135 where @xmath136 . for @xmath137 ,",
    "the system becomes aperiodic .      finally , it is of interest to compare the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) with another interesting nonlinear oscillator @xcite of the form @xmath138 which possesses exact periodic solution @xmath139 , where the frequency @xmath140 , exhibiting the characteristic amplitude - dependent frequency of nonlinear oscillators inspite of the sinusoidal nature of the solution eq .",
    "( [ lam126 ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ lam126 ] ) has a natural generalization in three dimensions @xcite and these systems can be also quantized exhibiting many interesting features and can be interpreted as an oscillator constrained to move on a three - sphere @xcite .",
    "several generalizations of these systems to @xmath141-degrees of freedom are also possible @xcite . but all these nice properties are subject to the fact that the frequency is amplitude - dependent .",
    "it is only eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) which admits the amplitude independence property of frequency for a nonlinear oscillator .",
    "studies of such systems will have important implications in developing nonlinear systems whose frequency remain unchanged even with the addition of suitable nonlinearity . also , eq .  ( [ lam126 ] ) when written as a system of two first order equations of the form ( [ lam124 ] ) , with @xmath142 the divergence of the flow function @xmath143 . on the other hand eq .",

    "once again it is only @xmath146 this again confirms that for a conservative system it is necessary that the average of the divergence of the flow function vanish .",
    "in this work , we have identified a nonlinear oscillator which exhibits unusual oscillatory properties : purely harmonic oscillation whose frequency is completely independent of the amplitude and is the same as that of the linear harmonic oscillator .",
    "the conservative hamiltonian nature of the system has been established , which also necessitates the generalization of the definition of conservative systems in terms of the divergence of the flow function .",
    "further , even for an apparently dissipative type / aperiodic ( front like ) type system , the hamiltonian structure is preserved and the definition of the conservative system in terms of the divergence of flow function needs to be generalized .",
    "we believe identification of such nonlinear systems having the basic property of linear systems will have considerable practical application as the effect of higher harmonics is completely suppressed .",
    "also it is of interest to consider the quantum mechanical version of the system ( [ lam123 ] ) and its higher dimensional generalizations as well as the effect of external forcing and additional damping , which are being pursued .",
    "we have also shown that eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) admits certain interesting geometrical properties .",
    "for example , under the invertible point transformation ( [ lin01 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ lam101 ] ) gets transformed to the free particle equation whereas with the appropriate choice of canonical transformations one can transform it to a simple harmonic oscillator ( or to an unbounded oscillator or to a freely falling particle depending on the value of the parameter @xmath48 ) equation .",
    "interestingly , the very same nonlinear oscillator can also be transformed to a third order linear equation through a nonlocal transformation , while yet another nonlocal transformation transforms it to a linear harmonic oscillator .",
    "as far as our knowledge goes no such single nonlinear oscillator possesses such large class of transformation properties .",
