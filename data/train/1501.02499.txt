    "by analogy with the classical period matrix of an ordinary riemann surface , one can define the super period matrix ( sometimes just called the period matrix ) of a super riemann surface .",
    "if @xmath4 is a super riemann surface of genus @xmath0 with even spin structure , then its super period matrix is a @xmath5 symmetric matrix of positive imaginary part .",
    "actually , the super period matrix is only defined for the case that @xmath4 has an even spin structure , and even then it is only defined generically : it can acquire a pole , with nilpotent residue , when moduli of @xmath4 are varied .    the first goal of the present paper is to extend the definition of the super period matrix to the case of a super riemann surface with ramond punctures .",
    "( a neveu - schwarz puncture , which is simply a marked point , does not affect the definition of the super period matrix . )",
    "it is conceivable that there is more than one reasonable definition .",
    "the definition we give here is motivated by an application that we will explain shortly . in this definition ,",
    "the super period matrix of a super riemann surface @xmath4 of genus @xmath0 with @xmath1 ramond punctures ( the number of ramond punctures is always even ) is a @xmath2 matrix , symmetric in the @xmath3-graded sense , whose @xmath5 bosonic block has positive definite imaginary part .",
    "( the super period matrix is in general not an arbitrary matrix of this sort , since in general there are schottky relations . ) just as in the classical case , the definition of the period matrix depends on a choice of @xmath6-cycles ; when ( and only when ) ramond punctures are present , one has to define fermionic as well as bosonic @xmath6-cycles .",
    "if one changes the @xmath6-cycles that are used in defining it , the super period matrix is transformed by an element of an integral form of the supergroup @xmath7 , generalizing the fact that in the classical case ( or for a super riemann surface without ramond punctures ) , the period matrix is defined up to the action of an integral form of @xmath8 . just as in the absence of ramond punctures ,",
    "the super period matrix is only generically defined , and can acquire singularities as moduli are varied .",
    "the application we have in mind involves superstring perturbation theory in genus 2 .",
    "every @xmath9 matrix of positive imaginary part is the period matrix of an ordinary riemann surface of genus 2 , unique up to isomorphism ( schottky relations only exist in genus @xmath10 ) .",
    "hence , to a super riemann surface @xmath4 of genus 2 with even spin structure , we can associate an ordinary riemann surface @xmath11 of the same period matrix .",
    "@xmath11 also inherits a spin structure from the spin structure of @xmath4 , and the association @xmath12 gives a natural holomorphic projection @xmath13 from the moduli space @xmath14 of super riemann surfaces @xmath4 of genus 2 with even spin structure to its reduced space @xmath15 which parametrizes an ordinary riemann surface @xmath16 with even spin structure .",
    "is everywhere defined ( on @xmath14 as opposed to its deligne - mumford compactification ) , in part because for @xmath17 ( unlike @xmath18 ) the super period matrix has no poles . since the odd dimension of @xmath14 is 2 , @xmath19 is actually a splitting of @xmath14 . ]    by integrating over the fibers of @xmath19 , one can map the two - loop vacuum amplitude of superstring theory , which is naturally a measure @xmath20 on @xmath14 , to a measure @xmath21 on @xmath15 .",
    "this procedure was the starting point in the celebrated analysis of the two - loop vacuum amplitude by dhoker and phong .",
    "( for a review with further references , see @xcite .",
    "dhoker and phong also went on to calculate scattering amplitudes in genus 2 , a much more difficult computation that is beyond the scope of the present paper . )    to analyze the integral @xmath22 , it makes sense to first sum over even spin structures before performing any integration . in this way",
    ", one projects @xmath21 from @xmath15 to @xmath23 , with the spin structure forgotten . in their original work , dhoker and phong analyzed this sum over spin structures for superstring theory on @xmath24 and for certain supersymmetric orbifold compactifications to six dimensions .",
    "they showed that the sum over spin structures vanishes in those models , analogous to the familiar gso cancellation in genus 1 .",
    "something new happens in general in the case of a compactification to _ four _ dimensions that at tree level has @xmath25 supersymmetry .",
    "( the most simple examples are provided by compactification of the heterotic string on a calabi - yau three - fold . ) in this case , it is possible for a 1-loop effect to generate a fayet - iliopoulos @xmath26-term , triggering the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "when this happens , one expects the genus 2 vacuum amplitude to be non - zero and proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "how does this occur in the context of the dhoker - phong procedure for computing the genus 2 vacuum amplitude ?    in general @xcite , the dhoker - phong procedure must be supplemented with a boundary correction ( a contribution supported on the divisor at infinity in the compactified moduli space ) .",
    "the boundary contribution to the genus 2 vacuum amplitude vanishes in supersymmetric compactifications above four dimensions , but in a four - dimensional model with @xmath25 supersymmetry , it is proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "this raises the possibility that in such models , the full answer comes from this boundary correction , and that the bulk contribution , computed with the procedure of dhoker and phong , always vanishes .",
    "something similar happens in the same models in one - loop computations of certain supersymmetry - violating mass splittings @xcite .",
    "in fact , in examples of orbifold compactifications to four dimensions with @xmath25 supersymmetry @xcite , the same behavior has been found that was found earlier in supersymmetric models above four dimensions : the bulk contribution @xmath21 to the genus 2 vacuum amplitude vanishes after summing over spin structures , without any integration over bosonic moduli . in the present paper , we will use the theory of the super period matrix with ramond punctures to demonstrate that this very striking behavior will occur in all supersymmetric compactifications to four or more dimensions .",
    "perhaps we should remark that general arguments based on supersymmetric ward identities ( see for example section 4 of @xcite ) can be used to determine the _ integrated _ genus 2 vacuum amplitude , but do not explain the `` _ pointwise _ '' vanishing that occurs in the dhoker - phong procedure .",
    "our goal here is to explain this more detailed phenomenon .",
    "the arguments governing the integrated behavior are completely general and apply for all values of the genus .",
    "the procedure that leads to pointwise vanishing is defined only for genus @xmath28 or at most ( as we discuss in section [ twop ] ) @xmath29 .",
    "we define the super period matrix with ramond punctures and explain some of its simplest properties in sections [ odd]-[dimform ] of this paper .",
    "( a parallel treatment of some of these issues from the point of view of supergravity will appear elsewhere @xcite . )",
    "the application to the two - loop vacuum amplitude is in sections [ twop]-[lowgenus ] .",
    "the general strategy to constrain the vacuum amplitude via supersymmetry is familiar @xcite , and involves comparing the genus @xmath0 vacuum amplitude to an amplitude computed on will denote the moduli space of super riemann surfaces of genus @xmath0 with @xmath30 neveu - schwarz punctures and @xmath1 ramond punctures .",
    "we write @xmath31 if we wish to indicate the type of spin structure .",
    "similarly , @xmath32 is the moduli space of ordinary riemann surfaces of genus @xmath0 with @xmath30 punctures , while @xmath33 is the corresponding moduli space with a choice of even or odd spin structure . ] @xmath34 .",
    "since we specifically want to constrain the genus 2 vacuum amplitude computed with a procedure that uses the super period matrix , we have to begin with an understanding of the super period matrix of a genus 2 super riemann surface with 2 ramond punctures . the super period matrix in this situation",
    "is only generically defined , with singularities on a certain locus in the moduli space .",
    "the trickiest part of our analysis is to show that these singularities do not ruin the argument ; see section [ lowgenus ] .",
    "some technical issues are treated in appendices . in appendix",
    "a , we explain in detail why the super period matrix has a pole ; in appendix b , we give an alternative explanation of the fact that the dhoker - phong procedure for integration over genus 2 supermoduli space requires a correction at infinity ; and in appendix c , we describe some properties of the genus 3 analog of the dhoker - phong procedure .",
    "we will begin by recalling the definition of a super riemann surface with or without ramond punctures .",
    "( the reader may want to consult a more detailed reference such as @xcite or @xcite . )",
    "then we go on to discuss periods .",
    "a super riemann surface @xmath35 is a complex supermanifold of dimension @xmath36 whose tangent bundle @xmath37 is endowed with a subbundle @xmath38 of rank @xmath39 that is completely unintegrable .",
    "complete unintegrability means that if @xmath40 is a nonzero section of @xmath38 , then @xmath40 and @xmath41 are everywhere linearly independent , so that @xmath41 generates @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath43 fits in an exact sequence @xmath44 dually , the cotangent bundle of @xmath4 fits in an exact sequence @xmath45 one can show that locally , one can pick coordinates @xmath46 on @xmath4 such that @xmath38 is generated by @xmath47 such coordinates are called local superconformal coordinates . dually",
    "the subbundle @xmath48 of @xmath49 is generated by @xmath50    a super riemann surface @xmath4 with ramond punctures is a complex supermanifold of dimension @xmath36 whose tangent bundle is still endowed with a subbundle @xmath38 of rank @xmath39 , but now the condition of complete unintegrability fails along a certain divisor .",
    "the local behavior is that @xmath38 is generated , in some coordinates @xmath46 , by @xmath51 since @xmath52 , we see that @xmath53 and @xmath54 fail to be linearly independent precisely along the divisor @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the exact sequence ( [ morz ] ) is replaced by @xmath57 dually , one has @xmath58 with @xmath59 generated by @xmath60 more globally , @xmath4 may have many divisors @xmath61 along which the local behavior of the subbundle @xmath62 is as just described .",
    "we call the @xmath61 ramond divisors",
    ". if @xmath4 is compact , the number of ramond divisors is always even .",
    "what appears in the exact sequences ( [ oppo ] ) and ( [ noppo ] ) is @xmath63 , which we might call the total ramond divisor . away from @xmath55 , @xmath4 is an ordinary super riemann surface . along @xmath55 , @xmath4 remains smooth , but there is a singularity in its superconformal structure .    a general holomorphic 1-form on @xmath4 can be written locally as @xmath64 .",
    "in contrast to the case of an ordinary riemann surface , a holomorphic 1-form is not necessarily closed ; if @xmath65 is a holomorphic 1-form , then @xmath66 is a holomorphic 2-form , with an expansion @xmath67 . in defining differential forms on a supermanifold",
    ", we define the exterior derivative to be odd , so @xmath68 is odd and anticommutes with @xmath69 , while @xmath70 is even and commutes with @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "we want to define periods of holomorphic 1-forms . just as in ordinary geometry ,",
    "periods , as topological invariants , are only defined for 1-forms that are closed .",
    "the most obvious periods are the analogs of classical periods .",
    "let @xmath65 be a 1-form on @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath71 is an oriented circle and @xmath72 is any continuous map , then @xmath65 pulls back to an ordinary 1-form @xmath73 on @xmath71 so we define the integral @xmath74 .",
    "just as in the classical case , if @xmath65 is closed , then @xmath74 only depends on the homology class determined by the map @xmath75 . for our purposes , the case",
    "that @xmath75 is an embedding is sufficient , so we can just think of @xmath71 as a smooth submanifold .",
    "see section 5 of @xcite .",
    "] of @xmath4 , of real dimension 1 ( or @xmath76 ) . in this case , we write just @xmath77 rather than @xmath74 . an embedded circle in the reduced space @xmath11 of @xmath4 can be lifted ( not canonically , but in a way that is unique up to homology ) to an embedded circle in @xmath4 .",
    "so , as in @xcite , one can define @xmath6-periods and @xmath78-periods for a closed holomorphic 1-form on @xmath4 that correspond precisely to the familiar @xmath6-periods and @xmath78-periods of a holomorphic differential on @xmath11 .",
    "thus if @xmath65 is a closed holomorphic 1-form on @xmath4 , it has the usual @xmath0 @xmath6-periods and @xmath0 @xmath78-periods . however , in the presence of ramond punctures , such a @xmath65 also has what we might call odd periods . as explained above , near any ramond divisor @xmath79 , we can pick local coordinates @xmath46 in which @xmath79 is defined by @xmath56 and in which the superconformal structure is defined by the distribution generated by @xmath80 or dually by the subbundle of the contangent bundle generated by @xmath81 in what follows , it is important that @xmath69 is uniquely defined up to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an odd constant .",
    "preserves @xmath84 , it is obvious that the superconformal structure determines @xmath69 only up to sign . to see that @xmath69 is also only defined up to a shift @xmath85 with @xmath83 an odd constant",
    ", one observes that the supergroup of dimension @xmath39 that acts by @xmath86 preserves the superconformal structure of @xmath4 and acts transitively on @xmath79 .",
    "one can verify that along @xmath79 , any superconformal transformation is equivalent to @xmath87 . ] in particular , at @xmath56 , we are not free to rescale @xmath69 except by @xmath88 , since this would disturb the relation between the two terms in @xmath84 or in @xmath53 . accordingly , the 1-form @xmath70 on @xmath79 is well - defined up to sign .",
    "we consider a choice of what we mean by @xmath70 as opposed to @xmath89 to represent an `` orientation '' of @xmath79 .",
    "the odd periods of a closed holomorphic 1-form @xmath65 are now defined as follows .",
    "since @xmath79 is defined by @xmath56 , when restricted to @xmath79 , we have @xmath90 here @xmath91 is a constant  independent of @xmath69  since @xmath92 .",
    "( the odd - looking factor @xmath93 in the denominator will be convenient later . )",
    "we simply define @xmath91 to be the odd period of @xmath65 associated to the ramond divisor @xmath79 .",
    "thus , an odd `` period '' is not defined by an integral but by `` evaluation '' of a 1-form along a ramond divisor .",
    "the sign of the odd period depends on the orientation of the ramond divisor , somewhat analogously to the fact that a 1-manifold @xmath94 in an ordinary riemann surface @xmath95 must be oriented if one wishes to define the sign of the period @xmath96 of a closed 1-form @xmath65 . with @xmath1 ramond divisors",
    "@xmath97 , we define in this way @xmath1 odd periods @xmath98 .",
    "thus in all , on a super riemann surface @xmath4 of genus @xmath0 with @xmath1 ramond punctures , we define @xmath99 even periods , just as in the classical theory , and @xmath1 odd periods .",
    "what is the natural symmetry group acting on these periods ?",
    "on the bosonic periods , we have the usual group @xmath100 of automorphisms of @xmath101 ( which coincides with @xmath102 ) .",
    "we can think of @xmath100 as the automorphism group of the skew form @xmath103 defined over @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 are even variables so @xmath107 @xmath108 are odd .",
    "the natural symmetries acting on the fermionic periods are as follows : we could permute the ramond divisors , thus permuting the fermionic periods , or we could reverse the orientations of the ramond divisors and thereby reverse the signs of the fermionic periods .",
    "the permutations and sign changes make up a finite group with @xmath109 elements .",
    "we can think of this group as a form of @xmath110 , since it is the automorphism group of the quadratic form @xmath111 , defined over @xmath104 , where the @xmath112 are the even differentials of odd variables @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "there are no obvious symmetries between even and odd periods .",
    "if we combine the two constructions , the full group @xmath115 that acts on the even and odd periods is the automorphism group of a form @xmath116 that is symmetric in the @xmath3 graded sense in @xmath99 odd variables @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath1 even variables @xmath112 .",
    "( for now the sign of the @xmath119 term is an arbitrary choice . )",
    "we think of this as a sort of superanalog of the intersection form of an ordinary riemann surface . over @xmath104 , there are no symmetries that exchange even and odd variables , so @xmath115 can be interpreted as @xmath120 , that is , as a form over @xmath104 of the orthosymplectic group .",
    "if we work over @xmath121 , of course the supergroup @xmath122 of symmetries of the form @xmath123 does mix even and odd variables .",
    "typically , not all of @xmath120 is realized as symmetries in string theory .",
    "a super riemann surface has a spin structure , so usually one has to consider only the subgroup of @xmath124 that preserves a spin structure .",
    "also it usually is more useful to consider the ramond divisors to be labeled ( or distinguishable ) , in which case one considers only the sign changes rather than permutations in @xmath110 .",
    "finally , in a certain sense , the space spanned by @xmath125 has a natural orientation , as we explain in section [ anex ] , so one can replace @xmath110 by @xmath126 .",
    "let us recall how one proves the symmetry of the period matrix of an ordinary riemann surface @xmath95 . if @xmath65 and @xmath127 are closed 1-forms on @xmath95 , one has the topological fact @xmath128 if @xmath65 and @xmath127 are holomorphic 1-forms , then @xmath129 , which would be a holomorphic 2-form , vanishes identically .",
    "so the left hand side of ( [ zelmo ] ) vanishes , and this leads to the symmetry of the period matrix .    to imitate this argument on a super riemann surface @xmath4 , we face two difficulties : _ ( i ) _",
    "if we view @xmath4 as a smooth supermanifold ( this can be done , though not quite in a canonical way ) , then it has dimension @xmath130 , but a two - form @xmath129 can only be integrated on a manifold of dimension @xmath131 ; _ ( ii ) _ on a super riemann surface , a holomorphic 2-form is not necessarily 0 .    the resolution of the first point is simply that , as explained in @xcite , if @xmath4 is a super riemann surface , with reduced space @xmath16 , then @xmath16 can be embedded in @xmath4 in a way that is not canonical ( or holomorphic ) but is unique up to homology .",
    "the image of the embedding is a smooth submanifold @xmath132 of dimension @xmath131 , and the proof of symmetry of the period matrix is made using integrals over @xmath133 rather than @xmath4 .",
    "the resolution of the second point was also explained in @xcite ( see also section 8.2 of @xcite ) . on a super riemann surface ( without ramond punctures ) , a closed holomorphic 2-form is exact , so if @xmath65 and @xmath127 are holomorphic 1-forms , then @xmath134 for some @xmath135 .",
    "this implies vanishing of @xmath136 , just as if @xmath129 were 0 , and leads to the proof of symmetry of the super period matrix .    before describing these arguments , and explaining how they must be modified in the presence of ramond punctures",
    ", we give a more elementary example .",
    "let @xmath137 be the supermanifold of dimension @xmath36 defined as the quotient of @xmath138 by @xmath139 here @xmath75 is an odd constant .",
    "@xmath137 is a complex supermanifold of dimension @xmath36 , but not a super riemann surface since the identifications in eqn .",
    "( [ torg ] ) do not preserve a superconformal structure .",
    "the expression @xmath140 defines a closed holomorphic 2-form on @xmath137 that is globally - defined and is not exact ( we can write it locally as @xmath141 , but @xmath142 is not globally - defined , since it is not invariant under @xmath143 )",

    "it can be embedded in @xmath137 as the submanifold @xmath146 defined by the equation @xmath147 .",
    "then one finds that @xmath148 the nonzero value of the integral is one way to prove that @xmath140 is not exact .",
    "( since @xmath140 is closed , the value of this integral does not depend on the precise choice of @xmath146 . )    on a super riemann surface @xmath35 without ramond punctures , the proof that a closed holomorphic 2-form @xmath149 is exact proceeds as follows . in local superconformal",

    "thus , the existence of a conserved worldsheet current leads automatically to a conservation law for genus @xmath0 amplitudes , for any @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "in closed oriented bosonic string theory , a continuous symmetry at tree level remains valid as a continuous symmetry to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "this result holds for any given riemann surface @xmath95 ; it does not in any way involve integration over moduli space .",
    "the same argument holds for continuous symmetries of superstring theory that arise from the ns sector .",
    "thus , loop corrections do not trigger spontaneous breakdown of a continuous global symmetry that arises in closed oriented bosonic string theory or the ns sector of superstring theory .",
    "however , we can not make such a simple argument for spacetime supersymmetry , which comes from the ramond sector .",

    "although in general @xmath4 has various separating and nonseparating degenerations , there are , as explained in @xcite ( and more fully in section 8 of @xcite ) , only two types of degeneration that contribute to the ward identity .",

    "we turn to the two - loop vacuum amplitude of heterotic string theory .",
    "potential contributions come from worldsheets with even spin structure only ( worldsheets with odd spin structure contribute to parity - violating amplitudes ) , so the vacuum amplitude is found by integration over @xmath14 .",
    "an effective procedure @xcite has been to first integrate over the fibers of the projection @xmath529 , so as to reduce the vacuum amplitude to an integral over the bosonic moduli space @xmath15 . at that point",
    ", it makes sense to sum over spin structures without integrating over any additional moduli .",
    "( this does not make sense before reducing to the bosonic moduli space , since there is no notion of changing the spin structure of a super riemann surface while otherwise leaving the surface unchanged . )",
    "quite a few supersymmetric compactifications to @xmath10 dimensions have been studied this way . in each case , after reducing to @xmath15 , the two - loop vacuum amplitude vanishes upon summing over spin structures , even without any integral over the bosonic moduli .",

    "as we recalled in the introduction , in general , in a supersymmetric compactification to four dimensions , the procedure of integrating over @xmath15 by integrating first over the fibers of the projection @xmath530 misses a contribution at infinity .",
    "so our result means that in such compactifications , the full two - loop vacuum amplitude is given by the contribution at infinity . in supersymmetric compactifications above four dimensions , there is no such contribution at infinity , and the whole two - loop vacuum amplitude vanishes .    before discussing the two - loop case , let us recall one way to understand what happens in genus 1 . on a superstring worldsheet @xmath4 of genus 1",
    ", we consider a two point function @xmath531 here as before @xmath532 is the spacetime supersymmetry generator with the ghost field @xmath83 included . on the other hand , we take @xmath533 to be the vertex operator for the dilatino  the spin 1/2 partner of the dilaton  at zero momentum . for superstring theory in @xmath24 , @xmath534 where @xmath535 are matter superfields representing the motion of the strings in @xmath24 , @xmath536 is once again the holomorphic spin field , and @xmath537 , @xmath538 , @xmath539 are gamma matrices . in compactified models , the definition of @xmath533 is changed slightly , but the details will not be important . the notation @xmath540 and @xmath541 is just meant to remind us that @xmath522 is holomorphic while @xmath533 is neither holomorphic nor antiholomorphic .",
    "these two vertex operators are both in the ramond sector , so @xmath4 is a genus 1 surface with 2 ramond punctures .",
    "such a surface has precisely 1 odd modulus .",
    "the characteristic subtleties of superstring perturbation theory result from the possibility of changes of variables such as @xmath542 , where @xmath543 is an even modulus and @xmath544 are odd moduli .",
    "so they do not come into play until there are at least two odd moduli . accordingly , none of these subtleties are relevant to the example under discussion .",
    "except for one important detail , we can think of @xmath545 and @xmath546 as points on the ordinary genus 1 riemann surface @xmath11 , and use the translation symmetries of @xmath11 to set @xmath547 .",
    "the detail in question is as follows : the generalized spin structure of @xmath11 changes when @xmath545 moves around a non - contractible loop in @xmath11 , and hence we should think of @xmath545 as a point in a @xmath548-fold unramified cover of @xmath11 , which we will call @xmath549 , that parametrizes a point in @xmath11 together with a generalized spin structure .",
    "the condition @xmath56 defines a single point on @xmath11 , but on @xmath549 it corresponds to four possible points @xmath550 , which are labeled by the four possible spin structures on @xmath4 or equivalently on @xmath11 .",
    "( the generalized spin structure of @xmath4 reduces to an ordinary spin structure for @xmath551 , where the two ramond punctures coincide . )",
    "the correlation function @xmath552 is a holomorphic 1-form on @xmath549 that has poles only at the points vanishes because of fermion zero modes in the matter system , so there are really only three poles , not four . ]",
    "because of the operator product relation @xmath553 where @xmath554 is the dilaton vertex operator at zero momentum , the residue of each pole is the dilaton tadpole corresponding to the given spin structure .",
    "the vanishing of the sum of the residues of the holomorphic 1-form @xmath552 on @xmath549 means that the dilaton tadpole vanishes , after summing over spin structures and before integration over bosonic moduli .",
    "a standard argument shows that in genus @xmath0 , the dilaton tadpole is @xmath99 times the vacuum amplitude .",
    "so the genus 1 vacuum amplitude likewise vanishes after summing over spin structures , but without integration over bosonic moduli .",
    "the same argument does not work in genus @xmath555 , because there is more than 1 odd modulus , and the subtleties of superstring perturbation theory do come into play .",
    "we can not think of the fermion vertex operator @xmath512 as a conserved current on a fixed worldsheet ; instead , as was summarized in section [ app ] , a proper general argument proceeds by applying the identity ( [ melf ] ) to the correlation function @xmath556 and analyzing all possible boundary contributions , including contributions that involve degenerations of @xmath4 . by such reasoning",
    "one can show that ( in a supersymmetric compactification with no goldstone fermion contribution ) , the genus @xmath0 vacuum amplitude vanishes after integration over all moduli .",
    "there is in general no simpler version of this statement that involves integrating or summing over only some of the moduli .",

    "( [ moxo ] ) . of course",
    ", we will have to take into account the fact that this map is only generically defined , but this turns out to cause no problem .",
    "the obvious singularities of the correlation function @xmath558 arise from a collision of the two vertex operators ; such a collision gives a pole whose residue is the amplitude on @xmath559 associated to the dilaton tadpole .",
    "we will reduce from @xmath560 to @xmath559 by extracting this residue . by adapting the classical argument that was explained above in genus 1 ,",
    "we will show that if one follows the procedure of dhoker and phong to compute genus 2 amplitudes , then the bulk contribution to the dilaton tadpole  and hence to the vacuum amplitude  vanishes after integrating over the fiber of @xmath561 , even before integrating over @xmath23 . concretely , integrating over the fiber of @xmath562 means integrating over the position at which the dilaton vertex operator is inserted , and summing over spin structures , but not integrating over the moduli of the underlying genus 2 surface @xmath11 .",
    "the bulk contribution to the genus 2 vacuum amplitude , computed with the dhoker - phong procedure , vanishes before that last integration .    to make the analysis , we write @xmath563 for a generic fiber of the projection @xmath504 , and we look at the behavior of @xmath556 near @xmath563 .",

    "the reason that this factorization exists is that the missing `` index '' of the codimension 1 form @xmath556 is tangent to the fibers of @xmath19 , not the base .",
    "this index is missing because @xmath522 is missing a factor of the antiholomorphic ghost field @xmath518 . from an antiholomorphic point of view",
    ", the map @xmath19 is just the forgetful map @xmath567 , and @xmath518 represents a 1-form dual to the motion of the operator @xmath522 along the fiber of this map .",
    "so the missing index is tangent to the `` fiber '' of the fibration @xmath19 , not to the base , and that is why @xmath556 can be factored as the product of the pullback @xmath568 of a full volume form @xmath65 on the base times a form @xmath566 of codimension 1 in the fiber direction .",
    "this factorization is not completely canonical , since @xmath65 could be multiplied by a nonzero function on the base of the fibration , but once we restrict to a particular fiber @xmath563 , @xmath566 depends on the choice of @xmath65 only by an overall multiplicative constant , which will not affect what follows .",

    "the contribution of such a splitting to the identity is the bulk contribution to the genus 2 dilaton tadpole , computed with the procedure of dhoker and phong .",

    "all possible spin structures occur because the fiber @xmath563 parametrizes among other things the generalized spin structure of the super riemann surface @xmath4 ( just as in genus 1 , the possible choices of this generalized spin structure are permuted when @xmath522 or @xmath533 is taken around a noncontractible loop in @xmath35 , and the generalized spin structure reduces to an ordinary one when the two operators meet ) .",

    "so if the singularities that correspond to dilaton tadpoles are the only ones that contribute in the identity ( [ mono ] ) , then we learn that with the dhoker - phong procedure , the sum over spin structures of the genus 2 dilaton tadpole vanishes .",

    "this is far too many zero modes for the locus @xmath640 to be dangerous . before discussing what happens to the identity ( [ mono ] ) ,",
    "let us simply discuss how the correlation function @xmath556 , understood as a form on @xmath560 of codimension 1 , behaves for @xmath649 .",
    "@xmath560 has odd dimension 3 , so in conventional language , to compute @xmath650 , one inserts three picture - changing operators on the worldsheet @xmath4 .",
    "each picture - changing operator ( pco ) contains a factor of the worldsheet supercurrent , which ( for strings in @xmath24 ) is linear in the rns fermions @xmath605 and @xmath648 and so can absorb one zero - mode .",
    "so the pco s remove 3 zero - modes , leaving 8 .",
    "because of the 8 remaining zero - modes , @xmath556 vanishes on the divisor @xmath640 . to determine the order of its vanishing , we let @xmath651 be a local parameter on @xmath560 with a simple zero at @xmath640 . at @xmath652 , there are eight fermion zero - modes that are not lifted by the pco s .",
    "all of these modes are lifted away from zero for @xmath653 and generically they are lifted to first order in @xmath651 .",
    "so if we write @xmath654 for the relevant modes that become zero - modes at @xmath652 , the integral over those modes near @xmath652 looks like @xmath655 where @xmath543 is an antisymmetric form that generically is nondegenerate and @xmath656 is its pfaffian .",
    "thus @xmath657 for @xmath658 .",
    "the analysis of the identity ( [ mono ] ) is more tricky than this , because in defining @xmath566 , we remove a factor @xmath568 that has a pole at @xmath652 . as we explain in section [ poleffect ] , the effect of this is to cancel one power of @xmath651 , so that @xmath659 for @xmath658 . in particular",
    ", @xmath566 has no singularity that would contribute to the identity ( [ mono ] ) .",
    "now let us consider compactification to four dimensions .",
    "the main difference is that the fields @xmath660 , @xmath648 , @xmath661 are not free fields on the worldsheet ; we can not talk about their zero - modes or use them in a simple way to predict a zero of an amplitude .",
    "also , we need to slightly modify the definition of the dilatino vertex operator @xmath533 that has all weights @xmath604 ; it is now the sum of two terms , each proportional to a spin field @xmath536 whose weights @xmath600 are all @xmath604 except for either @xmath662 or @xmath663 ( this ensures that the part of @xmath533 in the internal compact manifold is actually a holomorphic primary field of the appropriate dimension ) . in the counting of zero - modes , we should consider only @xmath605 and @xmath606 for @xmath664 , and the number of such modes , counted the same way as before , is now 5 instead of 11 .",
    "repeating the previous reasoning but with the smaller number of zero - modes , we find that @xmath556 is of order @xmath651 for @xmath658 and @xmath566 is of order 1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath566 has no singularity at @xmath652 that could contribute in the identity ( [ mono ] ) .",
    "hence in general , with the dhoker - phong procedure , the `` bulk '' contribution to the superstring measure vanishes in genus 2 after integrating over odd moduli and summing over spin structures , but before any bosonic integrations .",
    "our goal here is to justify some of these statements by describing the behavior of @xmath566 along the divisor @xmath665 where the super period matrix has a pole .",
    "it is helpful first to recall ( following @xcite , and using the language explained in section 3.6 of @xcite ) the origin of the picture - changing operators in worldsheet path integrals . for each odd variable @xmath666 , it is convenient to introduce also its differential @xmath667 .",
    "then the insertion of a pco at a point @xmath668 comes from an integral @xmath669 where @xmath670 is the usual commuting antighost field of superstring perturbation theory and @xmath671 is the worldsheet supercurrent .",
    "the integral over @xmath667 gives a factor @xmath672 , and naively the integral over @xmath666 gives a factor of @xmath671 .",
    "the product is the pco @xmath673 . however , although this treatment of the integral over @xmath667 is correct , there is more subtlety in the integral over @xmath666 .",
    "because of the lack of a natural separation between even and odd variables on supermoduli space , there are in general , depending on precisely how one parametrizes supermoduli space , additional @xmath666-dependent contributions hidden in other parts of the worldsheet path integral , beyond those written in ( [ zong ] )",
    ". we can expand @xmath674 .",
    "the @xmath675 term leads after integrating over @xmath666 to an insertion at @xmath166 of the usual pco @xmath673 , but the `` 1 '' term leads to insertion at @xmath166 of the operator @xmath672 , which we might call an incomplete pco .",
    "locally , one can parametrize supermoduli space in such a way that the incomplete pco s can be ignored , but in general , globally either one can not do this or doing this introduces other complications .",
    "so it is best to keep track of the contributions involving incomplete pco s .",
    "the only general constraint is that the worldsheet path integral with insertion of an odd number of incomplete pco s vanishes because of fermi statistics , so one can always assume the number of incomplete pco s to be even .",
    "now we consider our problem of the influence of the poles of the super period matrix on @xmath566 .",

    "when @xmath556 is computed in superconformal field theory , there is a contribution , proportional to @xmath681 , that can be evaluated using complete pco s only . as there are 3 odd moduli , this contribution involves 3 insertions of @xmath671 .",
    "these insertions can absorb 3 of the 11 fermion zero - modes ( for strings in @xmath24 ) described in section [ fzero ] , leading to a contribution to @xmath155 that , as explained there , is of order @xmath682 near @xmath652 .",
    "@xmath556 also has a contribution that is linear in the @xmath680 , arising from a contribution evaluated with 2 incomplete pco s and only one insertion of @xmath671 .",
    "this insertion lifts only one fermion zero - mode , giving a contribution to @xmath556 that is of order @xmath683",

    "( [ mono ] ) .    however , this reasoning is not valid , for reasons that are related in part to some of the usual subtleties of superstring perturbation theory . to define @xmath566 ,",
    "we are supposed to split off from @xmath556 the pullback of a volume form on @xmath23 .",
    "concretely , let @xmath686 be the three independent matrix elements of the pseudoclassical block of the super period matrix .",

    "the reason that pulling out the factor of @xmath688 $ ] changes the order of vanishing at @xmath652 is that the @xmath689 have poles at @xmath652 .",
    "with only three odd variables @xmath680 , since the @xmath689 are even , the residue of such a pole can only be a bilinear expression in the @xmath680 , and the products of the residues of the poles in different @xmath689 would vanish .",
    "accordingly , we lose nothing essential if we assume that only @xmath690 has a pole , and that its residue is proportional to @xmath691 .",

    "( [ mono ] ) .",
    "the effect of the poles of the super period matrix together with the use of incomplete pco s has been to reduce by 1 the expected order of vanishing of @xmath566 near @xmath652 : it vanishes as @xmath703 rather than @xmath682 .",
    "with more odd variables , we can repeat this process . for every pair of odd variables , the order of vanishing of @xmath566 along @xmath652 is reduced by 1 ( or the order of a pole",

    "so it appears that in a general supersymmetric compactification to four dimensions , the bulk contribution to the genus 3 vacuum amplitude , defined using the projection @xmath722 derived from the super period matrix , does not necessarily vanish pointwise after summing over spin structures .    for any @xmath0 , with precisely 2 ramond punctures , riemann - roch and serre duality can be used in the same way just described , to show that if @xmath441 , then the rns fermions associated to strings in @xmath24 have at least 11 zero - modes .",
