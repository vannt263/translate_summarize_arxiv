    "since the theory of solitons has very wide applications in fluid dynamics , nonlinear optics , biochemistry , microbiology , geophysics and many other fields , the study of soliton solutions has become one of the important issues of nonlinear evolution equations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , xu and tian @xcite investigated the osmosis @xmath2 equation @xmath3 where the positive convection term @xmath4 means the convection moves along the motion direction , and the negative dispersive term @xmath5 denotes the contracting dispersion .",
    "they obtained the peaked solitary wave solution and the periodic cusp wave solution of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the results are not complete . in the present letter",
    ", we shall continue their work and obtain the smooth soliton solutions of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) , so that we can supplement the results of @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we state the main results which are analytic expressions of the smooth soliton solutions of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) . in section 3 , we give the proof of the main results .",
    "we state our main result as follows .    for given constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 , let @xmath8 ,    \\(1 ) if @xmath9 , then eq.([eq1.1 ] ) has a soliton solution of the form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19",
    "\\(2 ) if @xmath20 , then eq.([eq1.1 ] ) has a soliton solution of the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30",
    "we shall give the proof of this theorem in section 3 .",
    "now we take a set of data and employ maple to display the graphs of the soliton solutions on @xmath31 plane .    taking @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( corresponding to ( 1 ) of theorem 2.1 )",
    ", it follows that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "we present the graph of the soliton solution in fig.1 ( a ) .",
    "taking @xmath42 and @xmath33 ( corresponding to ( 2 ) of theorem 2.1 ) , it follows that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the graph of the soliton solution is presented in fig.1(b ) .",
    "eq.([eq1.1 ] ) also takes the form @xmath51          note that ( [ eq3.4 ] ) has a singular line @xmath61 , to avoid the line temporarily we make transformation @xmath62 . under this transformation , eq.([eq3.4 ] ) becomes @xmath63 eq.([eq3.4 ] ) and eq.([eq3.6 ] ) have the same first integral as ( [ eq3.5 ] ) .",
    "consequently , system ( [ eq3.4 ] ) has the same topological phase portraits as system ( [ eq3.6 ] ) except for the straight line @xmath61 .",
    "obviously , @xmath61 is an invariant straight - line solution of system ( [ eq3.6 ] ) .    for a fixed @xmath60 , ( [ eq3.5 ] )",
    "determines a set of invariant curves of ( [ eq3.6 ] ) . as @xmath60",
    "is varied , ( [ eq3.5 ] ) determines different families of orbits of ( [ eq3.6 ] ) having different dynamical behaviors .",
    "let @xmath64 be the coefficient matrix of the linearized system of ( [ eq3.6 ] ) at the equilibrium point @xmath65 , then    @xmath66 and at this equilibrium point , we have @xmath67 @xmath68 by the theory of planar dynamical system ( see @xcite ) , for an equilibrium point of a planar dynamical system , if @xmath69 , then this equilibrium point is a saddle point ; it is a center point if @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; if @xmath72 and the poincar index of the equilibrium point is 0 , then it is a cusp .    in @xcite , xu and tian",
    "reported that when @xmath7 , system ( [ eq3.4 ] ) has two equilibrium points @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "( i ) if @xmath9 , then @xmath73 is a saddle point while @xmath74 is a center point .",
    "there is inequality @xmath75 ; ( ii ) if @xmath20 , then @xmath76 is a center point while @xmath74 is a saddle point .",
    "there is inequality @xmath77 .",
    "usually , a soliton solution of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) corresponds to a homoclinic orbit of system ( [ eq3.4 ] ) . in fig.2(a ) , the homoclinic orbit of system ( [ eq3.4 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are in ( [ eq2.3 ] ) , ( [ eq2.4 ] ) , ( [ eq2.5 ] ) and ( [ eq2.6 ] ) , respectively . substituting eq.([eq3.7 ] ) into the first equation of system ( [ eq3.4 ] ) and integrating along the homoclinic orbits , we have the expression of the solion solution as in ( [ eq2.1 ] ) .    in fig.2(b ) , the homoclinic orbit of system ( [ eq3.4 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are in ( [ eq2.13 ] ) , ( [ eq2.14 ] ) , ( [ eq2.15 ] ) and ( [ eq2.16 ] ) , respectively . substituting eq.([eq3.7 ] ) into the first equation of system ( [ eq3.4 ] ) and integrating along the homoclinic orbits , we have the expression of the soliton solution as in ( [ eq2.11 ] ) .",
