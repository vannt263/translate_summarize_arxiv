    "one finds that @xmath124 increases with increasing @xmath14 for fixed @xmath62 . as discussed above this",

    "this constraint then excludes a part of the parameter space  @xcite and reduces the magnitude of the @xmath124 for a given @xmath62 .",

    "however , as is obvious , the most striking effect arises due to the appearance of the dip itself .",
    "the existence of such a dip was first noted in ref .",
