    "we live in two worlds , each with its own kind of space , time , form , and substance .",
    "there is the _ phenomenal _ world , extended in phenomenal space and changing in phenomenal time , containing forms that at bottom are bounded regions filled with qualia ( introspectible properties like red or green ) .",
    "and then there is the _ physical _ world , whose spatial aspect is given by the spatial relations that obtain among material objects , whose temporal aspect is given by the temporal relations that obtain among actual events and/or states of affairs , and whose forms are sets of possessed spatial relations  as will be shown in this article .",
    "the first lesson of science is that appearances are deceptive .",
    "things are not what they seem .",
    "it is a commonplace of the contemporary scientific world view that matter is intrinsically particulate even though phenomenal space is perfectly homogeneous .",
    "it is another commonplace that molecules are not bounded by colored surfaces even though all objects in phenomenal space are .",
    "we are sufficiently aware that the concept of `` form '' appropriate for phenomenal objects ( a bounding surface ) and the concept of `` matter '' that goes with it ( continuous stuff filling bounded regions of phenomenal space ) are not applicable to physical objects ( objects in the physical world ) .",
    "but we are not yet sufficiently aware that the concept of `` form '' appropriate for physical objects and the concept of `` matter '' that goes with it , entail a concept of `` space '' that is inconsistent with the standard mathematical description of physical space .",
    "this concept of `` space '' , moreover , entails a concept of `` time '' that is similarly incompatible with the standard mathematical description of physical time",
    ". where physical time and space are concerned , we have yet to learn the principal lesson of science  appearances are deceptive .",
    "this article serves three purposes .",
    "the first is to show that the seemingly insurmountable interpretational problems raised by quantum mechanics have their roots in ways of thinking about ( and mathematically representing ) space and time that are adequate for dealing with the phenomenal world , but that are as inconsistent with the ontological implications of quantum mechanics as the notion of absolute simultaneity is with special relativity .",
    "the second purpose is to arrive at appropriate ways of thinking about physical space and time and at adequate concepts of `` form '' and `` substance '' .",
    "the third purpose is to pinpoint the fallacy underlying the inappropriate concepts and ways of thinking  the cookie cutter paradigm ( ccp)and to trace it to its neurophysiological roots .",
    "because it has neurophysiological underpinnings and thus is , in a sense , innate , rejecting the ccp is no easy task .",
    "yet it is worth the effort , for at the end we shall discover that the mathematical elegance and simplicity of quantum mechanics is matched by the depth and transparency of its ontological message .",
    "section  2 uses the paradigmatic two - slit experiment with electrons to argue that the reality of any set of spatial distinctions ( i )  depends on the system and ( ii )  is contingent on the existence of a matter of fact about the value of the corresponding position observable .",
    "what follows is that spatial distinctions can not be regarded as inherent in space , and that , therefore , the standard , substantive , set - theoretic conception of space is the wrong conception of physical space .",
    "section  3 introduces a conception of space that is consistently applicable to the physical world .",
    "this portrays space as the totality of spatial relations existing among material objects .",
    "the corresponding concept of form is analyzed and shown to imply the formlessness of all fundamental particles . the popular belief that a fundamental particle has the form of a point",
    "is thereby shown to be an illegitimate importation from the phenomenal world ( in which all objects have forms for psychological if not neurophysiological reasons ) into the world of physics .",
    "section  4 discusses two properties of phenomenal space ",
    "the quality of continuous extension and the absence of intrinsic divisions  and clarifies their relation to physical space .",
    "two ways of thinking about space and form , one based on how things appear in phenomenal space and one appropriate for quantum mechanics , are diagrammatically represented and compared .",
    "section  5 deals with the tricky question of how to think correctly about the simplest forms that exist in the physical world  those that consist of a single relative position .",
    "this involves two kinds of conditional probability assignments ( one noncounterfactual and one counterfactual ) and two corresponding kinds of probability ( one subjective and one objective ) .",
    "objective probabilities betoken an objective indefiniteness , and this entails that the spatial and temporal differentiation of the physical world has a finite limit .",
    "this is discussed in sec .  6 , wherein one also finds definitions of the adjective `` macroscopic '' as related to positions , objects , clocks , and space .",
    "section  7 discusses another paradigmatic experiment , the scattering of particles at right angles , and arrives at the conclusion that , _ intrinsically _ , all fundamental particles are identical in the strong sense of _ numerical _ identity .",
    "what makes this conclusion _ seem _ preposterous is the insidious notion that prevents us from decrypting quantum mechanics  the ccp .",
    "section  8 examines various definitions of `` substance '' in respect of their applicability to ( i )  a fundamental particle and ( ii )  that which each fundamental particle intrinsically is .",
    "it is found that there is exactly one substance ",
    "pure , unqualified existence , and that the physical world arises from it by the only logically consistent expedient  the realization of spatial relations . by entering into spatial relations with itself , existence acquires the aspect of a multiplicity of entities . but",
    "what exists at either end of each spatial relation is identically the same entity .",
    "all there is , at bottom , is existence and spatial relations between existence and itself .",
    "the final section is devoted to the ccp ",
    "the notion that the world s synchronic multiplicity derives from surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three - dimensional cookie cutters .",
    "this is shown to be rooted in our neurophysiological make - up .",
    "some of its consequences are examined to underline just how insidiously it prevents us from making sense of quantum mechanics .",
    "the two - slit experiment with electrons requires no introduction  @xcite . according to feynman  @xcite ,",
    "it `` has in it the heart of quantum mechanics '' . but",
    "this appears to be something so baffling that we are warned off speculating about its significance : `` do not keep saying to yourself , if you can possibly avoid it , ` but how can it be like that ? ' because you will go ` down the drain ' into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped .",
    "nobody knows how it can be like that ''  @xcite .",
    "the last word on the subject apparently is that `` [ e]lectrons seem to have modes of being , or modes of moving , available to them which are quite unlike what we know how to think about ''  @xcite .",
    "as will be shown in this section , if `` [ n]obody knows how it can be like that '' , it is because we use the wrong concept of space .",
    "if the behavior of electrons in two - slit experiments is `` quite unlike what we know how to think about '' , it is because we think about space as something that exists by itself  rather than by virtue of the spatial relations that obtain among the world s material constituents  and that contains , as subsets or partitions , all conceivable spatial divisions  @xcite .",
    "if all conceivable spatial divisions were intrinsic to physical space , they would have an unconditional reality ( that is , they would be real for every physical object ) , and one of the following statements would necessarily be true of every physical object @xmath0 contained in the union @xmath1 of two disjoint spatial regions : @xmath0 is inside @xmath2 ; @xmath0 is inside @xmath3 ; @xmath0 has two parts , one inside @xmath2 and one inside @xmath3 .",
    "if this were the case , no electron could ever pass through the union of two slits without passing through either slit in particular _ and _ without consisting of parts that pass through different slits .",
    "but this is precisely what electrons do when interference fringes are observed in two - slit experiments ( and we do not postulate hidden variables ) .",
    "what these interference fringes are trying to tell us is that spatial distinctions are not real _ per se_.",
    "they have a conditional reality ; they supervene  and thus depend  on the actual goings - on in the physical world .",
    "the conceptual distinction between two disjoint regions of space may be real for one physical object and nonexistent for another .",
    "if an electron can pass through the union of two slits without passing through either slit in particular and without consisting of parts that pass through different slits , it is because the distinction we make between the slits need not exist for the electron .",
    "the electron has not three _ a priori _ modes of going through the slits , as envisaged by albert  @xcite , but four :    \\(i ) = it takes the first slit and not the second slit ; + ( ii ) it takes the second slit and not the first slit ; + ( iii ) it takes the first slit and it takes the second slit ; + ( iv ) it takes the `` undivided union '' of the slits .",
    "the first three modes assign separate truth values to the two statements @xmath4 = `` the electron takes the first slit '' and @xmath5 = `` the electron takes the second slit '' . in",
    "so doing they entail that the distinction we mentally make between the regions defined by the slits , is real for the electron .",
    "( that no electron is ever found to move according to the third _ a priori _ mode betokens the electron s indivisibility . if we find an electron taking the first slit and we also find an electron taking the second slit , we observe two electrons , rather than one . ) the fourth mode of moving , overlooked by albert , is available to the electron if that distinction has no reality for the electron , or if nothing in the physical world corresponds to the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . whereas ( iii ) is a conjunction of two propositions with inconsistent truth values , ( iv ) is a single proposition .",
    "the expression `` undivided union '' appears between quotation marks because , taken literally , it is self - contradictory : what is undivided can not be a union .",
    "what the expression is intended to convey is that the division into separate regions of space , which exists in our minds , has no reality for the electron .",
    "so when is this distinction real for the electron ?",
    "the following is undisputed standard quantum mechanics : if something indicates the slit taken by the electron , or ( equivalently ) if there is a matter of fact about the slit taken by the electron , or ( equivalently ) if there is an actual event or state of affairs from which that slit can be inferred , then the electron has taken the indicated slit .",
    "in general : if something indicates the value taken by an observable @xmath6 then @xmath6 has taken the indicated value . the converse ,",
    "too , is standard quantum mechanics , where `` standard '' connotes , in particular , the absence of hidden variables : if nothing indicates the slit taken by the electron , then the electron has not taken a particular slit . in general : if nothing indicates the value taken by an observable @xmath6 then @xmath6 has not taken any value whatsoever .",
    "this ( the converse ) is not undisputed .",
    "there are `` quantum realists '' who deny the necessity of a property s being indicated and instead affirm that probability one is sufficient for the possession of a property  @xcite , or that an element of reality corresponding to an eigenvalue of an observable @xmath6 exists at a time @xmath7 if the prior probability measure for the time @xmath7 has the pure form @xmath8 and @xmath9 is an eigen-``state '' of @xmath6 .",
    "but this is an error .",
    "as i have argued in detail  @xcite , the contingent properties of quantum - mechanical systems ( or the values of quantum - mechanical observables ) are _ extrinsic _ : they supervene on what happens or is the case in the rest of the world .",
    "to paraphrase wheeler  @xcite , no property is a possessed property unless it is an indicated property  @xcite .",
    "if an observable @xmath6 has @xmath10 eigenvalues @xmath11 , a successful measurement of @xmath6 leads to an actual event or state of affairs that indicates @xmath10 truth values , one for each proposition `` @xmath6 has the value @xmath11 '' , @xmath12 .",
    "one of these truth values is `` true '' , the remaining @xmath13 truth values are `` false '' .",
    "any remotely feasible position measurement permits us to distinguish between at most a finite number of spatial regions ( although for theoretical purposes we may allow a countable set of distinguishable regions ) . in order to fully characterize a position measurement  and the observable",
    "being measured  we must specify the regions between which the measurement can distinguish .    as an illustration ,",
    "let us consider a particle the support of whose wave function _",
    "for_not _ at _",
    "@xcite  the time @xmath7 is contained in @xmath2 , and two arrays of detectors @xmath14 and@xmath15 .",
    "the sensitive regions of each array of detectors are disjoint , and their union contains @xmath2 .",
    "the two arrays thus measure different position observables on the particle , one capable of distinguishing between @xmath10 regions and assigning truth values to the @xmath10 propositions `` the particle is inside the sensitive region @xmath16 of @xmath17 '' , the other capable of distinguishing between @xmath18 regions and assigning truth values to @xmath18 propositions",
    ". if the first position observable is ( successfully ) measured , @xmath10 regions are distinct for the particle , and this finds expression in the existence of @xmath10 truth values for the @xmath10 propositions `` the particle is inside @xmath16 '' .",
    "if position measurements are seen in this light , it becomes clear that the necessary and sufficient condition for attributing a value to a position observable @xmath6 on a physical system @xmath0 is also the necessary and sufficient condition for the reality , for @xmath0 , of the distinctions we make between the regions in the spectrum of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath6 has a value if and only if that value is indicated .",
    "but what is indicated is not just the value of @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is capable of distinguishing between @xmath10 regions , @xmath10 truth values are indicated : for each of the @xmath10 regions , @xmath0 s presence in it or absence from it can be inferred .",
    "but the distinction we make between spatial regions has a reality for @xmath0 precisely if @xmath0 s presence in or absence from each region can be separately affirmed .",
    "hence the distinction we make between the @xmath10 regions in the spectrum of @xmath6 has a reality for @xmath0 if and only if the value of @xmath6 is indicated or , equivalently , if and only if @xmath6 has a value .",
    "applied to the two - slit experiment with electrons this means that the distinction we make between the slits is real for an electron if and only if something indicates the slit taken by the electron , or ( equivalently ) if and only if the corresponding binary observable has a value , or ( equivalently ) if and only if both @xmath19 and @xmath5 possess truth values . if the propositions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are neither true nor false , they are meaningless , and the distinction we make between the slits has no reality for the electron .",
    "the reality of spatial distinctions thus is contingent on what is , and what is not , indicated , and it also depends on the system .",
    "the standard , substantive , set - theoretic conception of space then can not be the right conception of physical space .",
    "physical space can not be something that exists by itself , independently of the world s material constituents , and that by itself contains , as subsets , all conceivable spatial divisions , for if it were such a thing , the reality of spatial distinctions could not be contingent .",
    "all conceivable spatial distinctions would be real _ per se _ , and hence they would be real for all physical objects .",
    "the electron could not go through the `` undivided union '' of the slits , and no interference fringes could be observed .",
    "what , then , is the right way of thinking about physical space ?",
    "one thing is clear : if space is not something that has intrinsic parts , the synchronic multiplicity of the physical world  the multiplicity of material objects  @xcite that exist at any one time  cannot be defined in terms of the `` parts of space '' .",
    "it can only be defined in terms of the material objects that exist at any one time and/or in terms of the spatial relations that exist among these objects .",
    "the following is equally clear : if space is not something that exists by itself and has intrinsic parts , spatial relations can not be attributed to its parts .",
    "spatial relations exist to the extent that they are attributable to ( pairs of ) material objects . and",
    "since spatial relations is all it takes to specify the spatial aspect of the physical world , it is safe to affirm that physical space _ is _ the totality of spatial relations existing among the world s material constituents  @xcite . here is another way of saying this : in order to describe the physical world , no reference to `` space '' is needed .",
    "all we need to refer to is the _ positions _ of material objects . and",
    "since these are relatively defined , reference to the relative positions of material objects  or , synonymously , to the spatial relations existing among material objects  is sufficient .",
    "it follows that there is no such thing as an empty physical space .",
    "a physical world without material constituents is a spaceless world .",
    "it also follows that there is no such thing as a physical space containing a _ single _",
    "material object , for two reasons .",
    "first , physical space contains spatial relations rather than objects .",
    "second , a physical world containing a single material object lacks spatial relations ; so it too is a spaceless world .",
    "( such a world , moreover , would be indistinguishable from the single object it contains .",
    "it takes a minimum of two material objects to create a world containing something other than itself , such as spatially related objects .",
    "a world containing a single object is like the clapping of one hand . )    for the same reason that a physical world containing a single material object is spaceless , a noncomposite object ",
    "one that lacks parts  is formless .",
    "if the wrong way of thinking about physical space  as a substance in which all conceivable spatial divisions inhere  were the right way of thinking about physical space , the parts of a material object @xmath0 would be defined by surfaces partitioning the space `` occupied '' by @xmath0 , and the form of @xmath0 would be defined by the surface bounding this space .",
    "a material object would have as many parts as the space it `` occupies '' , and a material object without parts would have the form of a point .",
    "but there is no substantive space in which spatial divisions inhere .",
    "therefore there are no surfaces by which the parts or the form of a material object could be defined . the ultimate parts of a material object are defined by their mutual spatial relations , and the form of a material object _ is _ the totality of its internal spatial relations  the spatial relations between its parts .",
    "a material object has as many internal spatial relations as it has pairs of parts .",
    "a noncomposite object lacks internal spatial relations , and therefore it also lacks a form .",
    "while the form of a material object @xmath0 is the totality of its internal spatial relations , the position of @xmath0considered not as an attribute but as an observable with contingently attributable values  essentially consists in @xmath0 s external spatial relations  those between @xmath0 or its material constituents and objects having no constituents in common with @xmath0 .",
    "two extreme cases are of special interest : ( i )  if @xmath0 is the entire universe , there are no spatial relations external to @xmath0 . hence the universe as a whole lacks a position , which makes good sense .",
    "the form of the universe , on the other hand , being the set of its internal spatial relations , is identical with the set of all possessed spatial relations , which is space .",
    "( ii )  if @xmath0 is a fundamental ( meaning , noncomposite ) particle  according to the standard model of elementary particle physics , the quarks and the leptons are fundamental , there are no spatial relations internal to @xmath0 . thus a fundamental particle has a position but it lacks a form .",
    "this too makes good sense . even on the inappropriate view of space as intrinsically and",
    "infinitely divided , the notion that a noncomposite object has a form would be redundant  as redundant as attributing positions to the `` points of space '' .",
    "( the `` points of space '' are not objects that _ have _ positions .",
    "they _ are _ positions .",
    "they are properties that are available for attribution to material objects . ) saying that an object has the form of a point would be the same as saying that it has no parts , or that all its spatial relations are external , or that , relative to any given reference object , exactly one position can be attributed to it",
    ". there would be no reason to characterize a fundamental particle as having a pointlike form _ over and above _ being a noncomposite object .",
    "the reasons for the popular belief that a particle has both a position and a ( pointlike ) form , have nothing to do with physics .",
    "they are psychological .",
    "they are to be found in the phenomenal world ",
    "the way we _ perceive _ the physical world . in the phenomenal world",
    ", the existence of spatial relations presupposes the existence of forms  visual percepts  to which spatial relations are attributable .",
    "forms are _ phenomenally _ prior to spatial relations . in the physical world",
    "the converse is true : the form of a material object being the totality of its internal spatial relations , spatial relations are _ ontologically _ prior to forms .",
    "again , in the phenomenal world positions are ( or seem to be  @xcite ) realized individually , by objects with ( ideally pointlike ) forms . in the physical world positions are not realized by position - marking forms .",
    "they are realized by means of external spatial relations , and if the corresponding relata lack internal spatial relations , they are formless .    in the days when an atom was still",
    "widely thought of as a miniature solar system , werner heisenberg , if i remember right , argued that if atoms are to explain what the phenomenal world looks like , they can not look like anything in the phenomenal world ",
    "an insight we have yet to assimilate in full . in the phenomenal world",
    ", in which objects are first of all bundles of qualia , every object necessarily has a form .",
    "the same is true of a world that is modeled after the phenomenal world , in which the shapes of things are bounding surfaces and matter is a continuous stuff filling the bounded regions .",
    "we smile at these simple - minded notions , yet the idea that a fundamental particle has a ( pointlike ) form is what becomes of these notions in the limiting case in which the bounding surface shrinks to a point . the space - filling stuff then metamorphoses into a material object that has both a position and a pointlike form .",
    "if we look into _ phenomenal _ space  the only space we _ can _ `` look into'',we perceive , first , a _ quality _ that goes beyond quantitative determinations and , second , a _ unity _ that goes beyond the unity of a set , defined by cantor  @xcite as `` a many that allows itself to be thought of as a one '' .",
    "the quality to which i refer is the continuous extension of phenomenal space .",
    "this is as much a qualitative feature of our visual percepts as is the sensation of turquoise that we experience when looking at a tropical lagoon .",
    "locutions such as `` relative position '' , `` spatial relation '' , or `` distance '' connote this qualitative feature as much as they connote quantitative determinability .",
    "distances possess , in addition to their ( more or less precise ) values , this qualitative aspect , and nobody lacking our pre - conceptual grasp of phenomenal space is in a position to know it , anymore than mary , confined from birth to a black - and - white room , was in a position to know color  @xcite .    to discern the unity i have in mind , consider the visual image of a finite line segment @xmath20 .",
    "let us label its end points with real numbers @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath20 is in an obvious sense divisible into smaller segments , but nothing in its image warrants the notion that it is intrinsically multiple , let alone that it is a concatenation of point individuals with the cardinality of the real numbers . while between the real numbers @xmath21 and @xmath22 there exists a nondenumerable set @xmath23 of real numbers , between the points labeled @xmath21 and @xmath22 there exists a perfectly continuous and intrinsically undifferentiated line segment @xmath20 .",
    "( note that the preposition `` between '' is used here in two distinct senses : a spatial sense``between the points labeled @xmath21 and @xmath22''and a nonspatial sense that signifies `` greater than @xmath21 and less than @xmath22 '' . )",
    "@xmath23 possesses something that @xmath20 lacks , namely the multiplicity of a set of intrinsically distinct elements .",
    "and @xmath20 possesses something that @xmath23 lacks , namely the quality of continuous spatial extension and the unity that goes with it  the unity of something that exists in advance of divisions . to thinkers from aristotle to kant and gauss it appeared self - evident that points on a line are extrinsic to the line , that they are added features not contained in it .",
    "they considered the line itself and , by implication , space itself is inherently undivided and as existing in an anterior relationship to limits and divisions .",
    "`` space is essentially one '' , kant wrote  @xcite , `` the manifold in it",
    "  arises entirely from the introduction of limits . ''",
    "unfortunately we have become so accustomed to conflating the continuity of phenomenal space with the discreteness of the set @xmath24  of triplets of real numbers that it is now almost impossible for us to tease them apart .",
    "we tend to visualize the reals as a continuous line without realizing that the very act of visualization introduces a qualitative element that is not warranted by the mathematical construction of the reals .",
    "conversely , in our attempt to get a conceptual grip on physical space we seize on the reals as a set that appears to contain sufficiently many elements to `` fill '' a continuous line and thus to possess its continuity . we even deprive ourselves of words that are needed to distinguish between @xmath23 and @xmath20 , as when we apply the adjective `` continuous '' to a _",
    "set_.    i will not quarrel over mathematical practice , which is justified by its results .",
    "nobody is forbidden to call a self - adjoint operator `` elephant '' and a spectral decomposition `` trunk '' , which makes it possible to prove a theorem according to which every elephant has a trunk .",
    "what is illegitimate is to create the impression that this theorem has something to do with biological pachyderms . by the same token",
    ", nobody is forbidden to call `` continuous '' a set that is cardinally equal to ( or greater than ) the real numbers .",
    "but it is illegitimate to identify this `` continuity '' with the continuity of a line in phenomenal space .",
    "it is therefore preferable to reserve the word `` continuous '' for the continuity that is a unique pre - theoretical feature of our visual percepts and images .",
    "continuity , so defined , is a feature of objects in phenomenal space  that is , of visual percepts , and it is not a feature of any mathematical set . is continuity a feature of objects in physical space ?",
    "the answer is `` yes '' , or at least `` why not ? '' .",
    "physical space is the set of all possessed spatial relations , and to each of these relations we can consistently attribute the quality of undivided spatial continuity .",
    "consider the distance @xmath25 between two material objects @xmath26 and @xmath27 . we tend to think of @xmath25 as a `` quantity '' , and we tend to attribute to it the multiplicity of a segment of the `` real line '' .",
    "that is , we tend to take it for granted that there are as many places between the two objects as there are real numbers between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the value of @xmath25 , assuming that @xmath30 has a value .",
    "in reality there are as many places in the physical world as there are material objects . the places at",
    "which objects may be located ( that is , the relative positions that may be attributed to them ) do not exist unless objects are located there ( that is , unless there are objects that possess them ) .",
    "there is no physical multiplicity that could qualify as inherent in a single spatial relation .",
    "there are nt any points or places between @xmath26 and @xmath27 unless other material objects are situated between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it takes a third object @xmath31 to introduce another two distances @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",
    "the same equation does not hold among the three distances @xmath25 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 .",
    "none of these distances is the sum of anything .",
    "@xmath25 is not a quantity `` made up '' of quantities ; it is a relation that possesses both the quality of undivided spatial extension and a value @xmath29 .",
    "it interposes no places between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "if anything interposes a location between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , it is another material object @xmath31 .",
    "thus kant was wrong after all .",
    "what is `` essentially one '' is not space but _ each spatial relation_. being the totality of all possessed spatial relations , space has the multiplicity of the set of all pairs of material objects . nor does `` the manifold '' in space , as he calls it , arise from the introduction of limits .",
    "kant labored under the delusion of the ccp ",
    "the notion that the world s",
    "synchronic multiplicity derives from surfaces that carve up space like three - dimensional cookie cutters , as we all do , thanks to our neurophysiological make - up ( see sec .  [ ccp ] ) . in reality",
    "the synchronic multiplicity of the physical world is due to the existence of spatial relations .",
    "figure  [ sf ] summarizes and contrasts two ways of thinking about space and form . the naive view , based on how things appear in phenomenal space , is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ sf]a , while the view appropriate for quantum mechanics is illustrated by fig .",

    "[ sf]b this frame is conspicuous by its absence . in the physical world , there is no space other than ( i )  the set of all relative positions and ( ii )  the quality of continuous spatial extension that is possessed by each relative position .",
    "while spatial relations in the phenomenal world derive their spatial character from phenomenal space , physical space derives its spatial character from the relations that it contains ( in the proper , set - theoretic sense of `` containment '' ) .",

    "the non - visualizable character of the quantum world was recognized early on  @xcite .",

    "classical physics is consistent with the view that space is both intrinsically and infinitely differentiated . _",

    "what is more , they ought to be so regarded , for the parameters that characterize a particle species ( mass , spin , and charges ) tell us how a particle behaves _ in relation to _ other particles ( specifically , how its external relative positions at different times are statistically correlated ) , but they tell us nothing about the particle s intrinsic behavior ( that is , how it behaves _ out of relation _ to other particles ) .",
    "what , then , is this mysterious thing @xmath73  that all particles intrinsically are , and what is a particle , given its intrinsic numerical identity with every other particle ?",
    "the least inappropriate concept is `` substance '' . but",
    "this concept is laden with connotations that are inapplicable to the fundamental constituents of matter and must therefore be `` peeled off '' .",
    "the only positive characterization we get from aristotle , who introduced the concept , is that a substance remains self - identical through change , and this is precisely what can not be said of a particle , although it may be said of that which all particles intrinsically are . for",

    "but it is definitely useless as an intrinsic characterization of a fundamental particle , for , in itself , this _ has no properties that need to be tied together_. recall that not only its contingent properties ( its external relative positions , the corresponding relative momenta , and its spin components relative to any given axis ) but also its dynamical parameters ( mass , spin , and charges ) tell us nothing but how the particle behaves _ in relation to _ the rest of the world .",
    "substance has been conceived again as that which is capable of existing independently of anything else . by this definition , too , @xmath73  can be considered a substance , while an individual particle can not .",

    "there would be no individual things ; there would only be @xmath73 .",
    "the relations , on the other hand , owe their existence not to the relata but to that which they instantiate  to @xmath73 , which takes on the aspect of a multiplicity of relata because of the existence of relations .",
    "i have just introduced a new concept : the ( logical , rather than physical ) process of _ instantiation_. instantiation is traditionally conceived as running parallel to predication : what gets instantiated is a predicable universal ( an aristotelian secondary substance or a platonic form like horseness ) , and the resulting instance ( e.g. , a horse ) is an impredicable individual .",
    "this way of thinking suggests that what is responsible for the instantiation is something that is present in the individual but absent from the universal , and this idea is at the root of the platonic - aristotelian dualism of matter and form and its subsequent transformations , including the erroneous idea that physical qualities are instantiated by the `` points of space ''  @xcite .",
    "the process of instantiation that takes us from @xmath73  to the fundamental particles of matter is something else altogether .",
    "as we have just concluded , all that @xmath73  bestows on an existing fundamental particle is _",
    "existence_. hence all that gets instantiated by the spatial relations is existence .",
    "@xmath73  is existence pure and simple . instead of arriving at this conclusion by analyzing experimental data , we could postulate pure existence and ask ourselves how it comes to be instantiated . to be effective , the instantiator must exist in advance of the instantiation .",
    "but in advance of the instantiation of existence there is nothing but existence .",
    "( if there existed anything else , it would be an instance of existence . )",
    "hence only existence can instantiate existence . but existence can instantiate itself solely by entering into relations with itself , for this is the only process consistent with the proper logical dependencies : the instances of existence exist because the instantiating relations exist ; the instantiating relations exist because @xmath73  enters into relations with itself ; and @xmath73  exists because it is `` the one independent reality of which all things are an expression''a dictionary definition of `` the absolute ''  @xcite",
    ".    thus if we adopt the premise of parmenides that ultimately there exists a one being  @xcite  which is also the first assumption common to all his predecessors , and if we avoid the pitfalls created by the ccp , we can see how the physical world arises from that one being by the only logically consistent expedient ",
    "the realization of spatial relations .",
    "the relations account for the existence of material forms , and the intrinsic numerical identity of the relata accounts for the behavior of indistinguishable particles .",
    "this is sufficient reason to postulate something like an absolute or pure existence as a fundamental explanatory principle within physics itself . in good spinozistic tradition ( but",
    "with what seems to me a great deal more justification ) i submit that there exists exactly one substance , that every fundamental particle , considered in itself , is this one substance , and that the particles , considered in relation to each other , are simply the relata that are logically entailed by the existence of spatial relations _ between this one substance and itself_. by entering into spatial relations with itself , @xmath73  acquires the aspect of a multiplicity of entities , all of which are intrinsically as indeterminate as @xmath73  itself because intrinsically each of them is @xmath73 .",
    "what exists at either end of the spatial relation of any pair of fundamental particles is identically the same  @xmath73 .",
    "all there is , at bottom , is @xmath73  and spatial relations between @xmath73  and @xmath73 .",
    "spatial relations , as we have seen in sec .  [ spaceform ] , constitute both physical space and the shapes of material things .",
    "they are , moreover , _",
    "internal to _ @xmath73 .",
    "recall from sec .",
    "[ smallthings ] that a fundamental particle , considered in itself , does not exist in space ; instead , space is a web of relations spun _ between _ the fundamental particles .",
    "add to this the conclusion that all fundamental particles are identically the same substance , and it follows that all spatial relations  and hence physical space itself  is internal to this one substance .",
    "the contrast with the vulgar conception of physical space as a container containing a multitude of self - existent substances ( forms filled with stuff or pointlike bits of stuff ) could hardly be greater .",
    "according to russell  @xcite , `` substance '' is a metaphysical mistake , due to transference to the world - structure of the structure of sentences composed of a subject and a predicate .",
    "is this criticisms applicable to the one substance that i postulate as a fundamental explanatory principle ?",
    "the answer is no , and the reason is that this postulate explains something that would otherwise remain unexplained .",
    "`` no acceptable explanation for the miraculous identity of particles of the same type has ever been put forward '' , misner et al .",
    "@xcite wrote .",
    "`` that identity must be regarded , not as a triviality , but as a central mystery of physics . ''",
    "the `` miraculous identity of particles of the same type '' is exemplified by the scattering experiment discussed in sec .",
    "this is sufficiently explained by the _",
    "numerical _ identity of all fundamental particles , considered in themselves .",
    "if we approach the experimental data with the assumption of transtemporal identity , as we are inclined to do , nothing can possibly explain the observed statistics of that experiment .",
    "but if we can bring ourselves to admit that identically the same substance exists at either end of each spatial relation , that statistics becomes a natural consequence of this numerical identity .    the real problem is not identity  be it the identity of this particle with that particle or the identity of this region here with that region there .",
    "the real problem is difference .",
    "identity being the fundamental truth about the physical world , it is the proper starting point for all physical explanations .",
    "what needs explaining is not how two particles or two regions of space can be identical but how they become effectively distinct .",
    "no theory explains everything .",
    "aristotle explained motion but did not explain rest .",
    "he considered it `` natural '' for bodies to be at rest .",
    "newton explained acceleration but did not explain uniform motion .",
    "he considered it `` natural '' for bodies to be in uniform motion .",
    "einstein explained geodesic deviation but did not explain geodesic motion .",
    "he considered it `` natural '' for bodies to move along timelike geodesics .",
    "quantum mechanics explains geodesic motion in terms of interference  in the classical limit all trajectories but one interfere destructively  but leaves unexplained the nature and existence of quantum - mechanical interference .",
    "one day this too may be explained  @xcite .",
    "but there is one question that no theory can aspire to answer , and this is the question of how is it that there is anything , rather than nothing .",
    "i would therefore consider truly fundamental only that theory which postulates nothing but pure , unqualified existence , and which can tell us how the physical world is both based on this existence ( all particles are `` made of '' it ) and suspended within it ( space itself is internal to it ) .",
    "that theory is quantum mechanics .",
    "it tells us that the physical world arises from pure existence by a self - differentiation that involves nothing but the realization of spatial relations .",
    "these account for all the differences that we observe in the physical world at any one time ",
    "differences between locations and differences between things .",
    "no physical theory can define what essentially distinguishes the actual world from a nomologically possible world ( any world consistent with the laws of physics ) . _",
    "a fortiori _ , no physical theory can account for the actuality of the actual world or the factuality of facts .",
    "this is something that classical physics did not have to worry about , for classical theories never dealt with the actual world .",
    "classical physics concerned nomologically possible worlds , and the question as to which of these worlds describes the actual world was to be settled by observation rather than by any theory .    in quantum physics , by contrast , possibilities and facts are inextricably entwined .",
    "quantum physics assigns probabilities to the possible results of possible measurements on the basis of the actual results of actual measurements .",
    "the theory talks about what _ actually _ happens or is the case .",
    "it distinguishes between ( i )  alternatives all of which are mere _ possibilities _ ( in which case it instructs us to add amplitudes ) and ( ii )  alternatives of which one is _ factual _ ( in which case it instructs us to add probabilities ) .",
    "while classical physics is indifferent to the mystery of existence , quantum physics confronts us with it , and in two ways . for one ,",
    "it presents us with property - indicating _ facts _ that are uncaused and therefore intrinsically inexplicable  @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , it deals with fundamental particles , which in themselves are _ existence _ pure and simple .",
    "these numinous _ apperus _ of `` bare reality '' play distinct ontological rles .",
    "while the uncaused facts are the ultimate reason why there is something sayable , that which all particles intrinsically are is the ultimate reason why there is something of which anything can be said .",
    "what ultimately prevents us from decrypting quantum mechanics ( without extraneous additions like hidden variables  @xcite or spontaneous collapses  @xcite , without using `` world '' in the plural  @xcite , and without distinguishing between a mind - constructed `` internal '' or `` empirical '' reality and a mind - independent `` external '' or `` veiled '' reality  @xcite or bringing in consciousness in other ways  @xcite ) is the ccp  the innate idea that the world s synchronic multiplicity derives from surfaces that divide up space like three - dimensional cookie cutters .",
    "the present section begins by explaining why this idea can be regarded as innate , and then focuses on how it prevents us from making sense of quantum mechanics .",
    "we are adept at recognizing three - dimensional objects in drawings containing only outlines .",
    "( in fact , we ca nt help but perceive three - dimensional objects .",
    "we always see a necker cube as pointing either in or out . ) the reason why outlines are so easily recognized as objects lies in the manner in which the brain processes visual information .",
    "the seminal work of hubel and wiesel  @xcite supports the following account .",
    "visual information flows from retinal receptor cells via retinal ganglion cells to either of two lateral geniculate nuclei , and on to the primary visual cortex .",
    "the receptive field of each retinal ganglion or geniculate cell is divided into either an excitatory center and a concentric inhibitory surround ( the `` on center '' configuration ) or the reverse configuration ( `` off center '' ) .",
    "( the group of retinal receptor cells from which a retinal ganglion or geniculate cell receives input is known as the cell s receptive field . )",
    "thus an `` on center '' cell responds best to a circular spot of light of a specific size , responds well to a bright line that just covers the center ( since then most of the surround is not covered by the line ) , and does not respond at all if both center and surround are fully and equally illuminated .",
    "when visual information reaches the visual cortex , two major transformations take place .",
    "one leads to the fusion of input from both eyes , the other to a rearrangement of incoming information so that most of its cells respond to _ specifically oriented line segments_. the optimal stimulus may be a bright line on a dark background or the reverse , or it may be a boundary between light and dark regions .",
    "one group of orientation - specific neurons responds best to lines with just the right tilt in a particular part of the visual field .",
    "another group of neurons , receiving input from the first group , is less particular about the position of the line and responds best if the line is swept in a particular direction across the visual field .",
    "these data suggest that visual representations arise by way of an analysis of the visual field that is based on _ contrast information from boundaries between homogeneously lit regions_. data arriving from homogeneously colored and evenly lit regions do not make it into conscious awareness .",
    "the interior of such a region is _ filled in _ on the basis of contrast information stemming from its _",
    "boundary_. this interpretation receives strong support from the remarkable faithfulness of color perception to the reflectances of colored surfaces , and its corresponding insensibility to the actual spectral composition of the radiances of such surfaces .",
    "( if color perception is based on discontinuous color changes across edges , continuous variations in illumination across the visual field go unperceived  @xcite . )",
    "it also explains why the blind spot is not perceived if it falls inside a homogeneous region ( no sense data arrive from such a region anyway ) , and why outline drawings are so readily recognized as objects : the brain adds surfaces to outlines in the same way as it adds ( unperceived ) colored surfaces to ( perceived ) changes in color and brightness across edges .",
    "while the visual field is inherently grainy ( an array of retinal receptor cells ) , the phenomenal world is smooth . that we are unaware of the graininess is another consequence of how the brain processes visual information .",
    "not only are uniformly colored regions of the visual field filled in homogeneously on the basis of contrast information across boundaries  @xcite , but also the graininess of the boundaries is glossed over .",
    "cells that respond to specifically oriented line segments in a particular part of the visual field receive input from cells with lined - up circular receptive fields .",
    "while the information coming from cells of the latter type is discrete , the perception of a line segment occurring when a cell of the former type is stimulated is continuous .",
    "the phenomenal world thus is intrinsically a world of sharp and continuous boundaries filled with homogeneous content . unlike the physical world",
    ", it _ is _ constructed from boundaries , and for this reason it conforms to the ccp  @xcite . and",
    "if we naively believe that the physical world is constructed in the same way , we can not but fail to make sense of quantum mechanics .    to see just how",
    "insidiously the ccp prevents us from decrypting quantum mechanics , let us examine some of its consequences .",
    "the idea that the synchronic multiplicity of the world depends on boundaries , or that the parts of a material object exist by virtue of the parts of the space it `` occupies '' , leads to the standard , substantive conception of an intrinsically and infinitely differentiated space .",
    "it is a substantive conception because it portraits space as intrinsically divided , and it does so because the parts of matter exist by virtue of the parts of space .",
    "( we can not then hold the multiplicity of matter responsible for the multiplicity of space . )",
    "further , the parts of an intrinsically divided substantive space exist in themselves ; each part  and in clear this means , each _ conceivable _ part  is a separate constituent of the world .",
    "but if _ all _ parts of space exist in themselves , there exist ultimate , not further divisible parts .",
    "( if each part were further divisible , we could not regard the division of space as completed .",
    "hence we could not conceive of all parts of space as existing in themselves , independently of an always continuable process of division  @xcite . )",
    "this is how the ccp tricks us into believing that space is adequately represented by ( a point set cardinally equal to ) @xmath24 .      *",
    "every material object has a form , defined as the boundary of the space it `` occupies '' .",
    "* a material object has as many parts as the space it `` occupies '' .",
    "a noncomposite object therefore has the form of a point .",
    "* two material objects can not `` occupy '' the same space .",
    "therefore all material objects are distinguishable by their positions . *",
    "numerically sharp distances exist between all points of space .",
    "the distances between two material objects is the distance between two points of space . hence numerically",
    "sharp distances exist between all material objects .",
    "as the present article has demonstrated , none of these consequences of the ccp is consistent with what quantum mechanics is trying to tell us . yet , to my knowledge , no interpretation of quantum mechanics except the pondicherry interpretation  @xcite has ever challenged the ccp .",
