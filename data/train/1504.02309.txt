    "these studies reveal that fluid and particle inertia affect the orientational dynamics of a neutrally buoyant spheroid in a simple shear in intricate ways .",

    "the question of describing the rotation of a neutrally buoyant particle in a simple shear flow has a long history .",
    "jeffery derived an expression for the torque on an ellipsoidal ( tri - axial ) particle neglecting inertial effects @xcite . to obtain an equation of motion for small particles he assumed that the dynamics is overdamped , that the particle rotates so as to instantaneously achieve zero torque .",
    "this gives rise to jeffery s equation that is commonly quoted for the special case of spheroidal ( axisymmetric ) particles . from this equation",
    "it follows that spheroids suspended in a simple shear tumble , they stay aligned with the flow direction for some time and then switch orientation by @xmath18 degrees .",
    "the dynamics is degenerate in that there are infinitely many different periodic orbits , the so - called jeffery orbits .",
    "the initial orientation determines which particular orbit is selected .",
    "the goal of jeffery s calculation was to compute the viscosity of a dilute suspension of spheroids , and jeffery hypothesised that the particles select orbits that minimise energy dissipation .",
    "saffman@xcite pointed out that inertial effects lift the degeneracy of the jeffery orbits , and he described the orientational dynamics of a nearly spherical particle in a simple shear taking into account fluid inertia .",
    "for prolate particles he concluded that log - rolling is stable , that tumbling in the shear plane is unstable , and that the stabilities are reversed for oblate particles .",
    "these results are stated in terms of an effective drift for the particle orientation ( towards the vorticity axis for prolate particles ) .",
    "this conclusion supports jeffery s hypothesis .",
    "saffman did not take into account particle inertia .",
    "his method of calculation rests on a joint expansion in small eccentricity and @xmath4 .",
    "harper & chang@xcite addressed the problem in a different way , modeling the dynamics of a rod in a simple shear in terms a dumb - bell , that is two spheres connected by an invisible rigid rod .",
    "the spheres are subject to stokes drag and hydrodynamic lift forces@xcite .",
    "this approximation neglects hydrodynamic interactions between the two spheres , as well as the unsteady term in the navier - stokes equations .",
    "harper & chang arrive at the opposite conclusion , namely that log - rolling is unstable . since their result pertains to the slender - body limit",
    "the question is how the stability of the log - rolling orbit depends on the particle aspect ratio .",
    "it was subsequently shown by hinch & leal@xcite how weak rotational diffusion breaks the degeneracy of the jeffery orbits , and their results form the basis for a large part of the work during the last decades on the rheology of dilute suspensions , see refs .   and for reviews .",
    "recently there has been a surge of interest in determining the effect of weak inertia upon a spheroid tumbling in a simple shear flow in the absence of rotational diffusion .",
    "subramanian & koch@xcite derived an effective equation of motion for a neutrally buoyant rod in the slender - body limit to first order in fluid and particle inertia .",
    "their calculation uses a reciprocal theorem@xcite and takes into account the unsteady term in the navier stokes equation as well as particle inertia .",
    "the authors arrive at qualitatively the same conclusion as harper & chang , namely that the orientation of the rod eventually drifts towards the flow - shear plane .    in a second paper subramanian & koch@xcite repeated saffman s calculation for a neutrally buoyant nearly spherical particle .",
    "they used a different method , similar to the one used in ref .",
    ", and come to the same conclusion as saffman , that log - rolling is stable for nearly - spherical prolate particles .",
    "recent dns@xcite have explored the stability of log - rolling and tumbling orbits , mostly at moderate and large reynolds numbers , and only for a small number of aspect ratios .",
    "the simulations show unstable log - rolling for prolate particles at the smallest reynolds numbers studied .",
    "we note that you , phan - thien & tanner@xcite misquote saffman when they describe their numerical results on the rotation of a spheroid in a couette flow at reynolds numbers of the order of @xmath19 and larger . in the introduction of ref .",
    "it is implied that saffman s theory@xcite predicts that nearly spherical prolate particles tend to the flow - shear plane .",

    "the most technical details and tabulations are deferred to appendices .",

    "finally we explain the perturbation scheme and list the symmetries that severely constrain the form of the solution .",
    "the calculations described in this paper involve vectors and tensors in three spatial dimensions .",
    "we employ index notation with the implicit summation convention for repated indices , and we use the kronecker ( @xmath20 ) and levi - civita ( @xmath21 ) tensors .      [",
    "sec : units ] the physics of the problem is governed by three dimensionless numbers : the shear reynolds number @xmath4 ( measuring fluid inertia ) , the stokes number @xmath22 ( measuring particle inertia ) and the particle aspect ratio @xmath23 .",
    "we work with dimensionless variables .",
    "the length scale is given by the particle major axis @xmath1 .",
    "the velocity scale is taken to be @xmath24 where @xmath2 is the shear rate .",
    "the explicit time dependence of the flow ( the time scale for the unsteady fluid inertia ) scales as @xmath25 since it is determined by the particle angular velocity because to lowest order the unsteadiness arises from the particle motion .",
    "the corresponding scale for pressure is @xmath26 , and force and torque are measured in units of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .    from these scales",
    "the dimensionless parameters are formed .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the shear reynolds number is defined as @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the density and @xmath31 is the dynamic viscosity of the surrounding fluid ( @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity ) .",
    "the stokes number , measuring the particle inertia , is given by the ratio of the typical rate of change of angular momentum and the typical torque : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the particle density . for a neutrally buoyant particle , @xmath34",
    ", we have @xmath35 .",
    "we define the particle aspect ratio @xmath23 as the ratio between the length along the symmetry axis and the length transverse to the symmetry axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . that is",
    "@xmath36 denotes prolate particles while @xmath37 denotes oblate particles .",
    "because we measure length in units of the major particle axis @xmath1 , the aspect ratio @xmath23 of a prolate particle is @xmath38 , while the aspect ratio of an oblate particle is @xmath39 , where @xmath13 denotes the length of the minor axis of the particle ( see fig .",

    "[ sec : torque ] the straightforward approach to determine the torque on a particle in a fluid is to solve navier - stokes equations for the velocity and pressure fields , then compute the stress tensor and finally integrate the stress tensor over the surface of the particle .",
    "the reciprocal theorem@xcite offers an alternative , and often more convenient , route to the hydrodynamic forces .",
    "in particular , we may avoid solving for the complete flow field . in this section",

    "<S> we find stable tumbling in the shear plane , log - rolling is unstable . for oblate particles , by contrast , log - rolling is stable and tumbling is unstable provided that the aspect ratio is larger than a critical value . when the aspect ratio is smaller than this value tumbling turns stable , and an unstable limit cycle is born . </S>"
