    "the analysis of modern accelerator - based neutrino oscillation experiments requires good control over the intermediate - energy neutrino - nucleus scattering cross section @xcite . in particular",
    "the importance of multi - nucleon events has been suggested in many calculations of charge - changing quasielastic cross sections @xmath2 , at typical neutrino energies of @xmath3 gev  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of two - particle - two - hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data  @xcite .",
    "thus a growing interest has arisen in including 2p-2h models into the monte carlo event generators used by the neutrino collaborations @xcite .",
    "the only 2p-2h model implemented up to date in some of the monte carlo neutrino event generators corresponds to the so - called ific valencia model  @xcite , which has been incorporated in genie  @xcite .",
    "there are also plans to incorporate the lyon model  @xcite in genie , while phenomenological approaches like the effective transverse enhancement model of  @xcite are implemented , for instance , in nuwro generator  @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems to implementing the 2p-2h models is the high computational time .",
    "this is due to the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over the final 2p-2h states . to speed up the calculations ,",
    "several approximations can be made , such as choosing an average momentum for the nucleons in the local fermi gas  @xcite , neglecting the exchange matrix elements , or reducing the number of integrations to two nested integrals by performing a non - relativistic expansion of the current operators  @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is only useful for some pieces of the elementary 2p-2h response .    in this work we present a fast and very efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic fermi gas model ( rfg )",
    "this approach , denoted as the frozen nucleon approximation , was first explored in @xcite but restricted to the analysis of the 2p-2h phase - space . here",
    "it is extended to the evaluation of the full hadronic tensor assuming that the initial momenta of the two struck nucleons can be neglected for high enough energy and momentum transfer , @xmath4 .",
    "the frozen nucleon approximation was found to work properly in computing the phase space function for two - particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators .",
    "here we investigate the validity of the frozen approximation beyond the phase - space study by including the electroweak meson - exchange current ( mec ) model of @xcite .",
    "we find that the presence of virtual delta excitations requires one to introduce a `` frozen '' @xmath1-propagator , designed by a convenient average over the fermi sea .",
    "the main advantage of the frozen approximation consists in reducing the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 ( full calculation ) to 1 .",
    "thus it is well - suited to computing the 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux , and it can be of great help in order to implement the 2p-2h models in the monte carlo codes currently available .",

    "<S> we present a fast and efficient method to compute the inclusive two - particle two - hole ( 2p-2h ) electroweak responses in the neutrino and electron quasielastic inclusive cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on two approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the first neglects the motion of the two initial nucleons below the fermi momentum , which are considered to be at rest . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation , which is reasonable for high values of the momentum transfer , turns out also to be quite good for moderate values of the momentum transfer @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the second approximation involves using in the `` frozen '' meson - exchange currents ( mec ) an effective @xmath1-propagator averaged over the fermi sea . within the resulting `` frozen nucleon approximation '' , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive 2p-2h responses are accurately calculated with only a one - dimensional integral over the emission angle of one of the final nucleons , thus drastically simplifying the calculation and reducing the computational time . </S>",
    "<S> the latter makes this method especially well - suited for implementation in monte carlo neutrino event generators .    </S>",
