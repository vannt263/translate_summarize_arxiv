    "the ( classical ) noncrossing partitions were introduced by kreweras in  @xcite .",
    "work of athanasiadis , bessis , biane , brady , reiner and watt  @xcite led to the recognition that the classical noncrossing partitions are a special case ( @xmath5 ) of a combinatorial construction which yields a noncrossing partition lattice @xmath2 for each finite coxeter group  @xmath4 .",
    "besides the interesting algebraic combinatorics of the @xmath3-noncrossing partition lattice , there is a strong motivation for this definition arising from geometric group theory . in that context , @xmath2 is a tool for studying the artin group associated to  @xmath4 .",
    "( as an example , the artin group associated to @xmath6 is the braid group . ) for the purposes of artin groups , a key property of @xmath2 is the fact that it is a lattice .",

    "the motivation for the present work is a new construction of @xmath2 leading to a new proof that @xmath2 is a lattice .",

    "thus , one can take the new construction as a definition of @xmath2 .",

    "although the motivation for this paper lies squarely in the realm of coxeter groups , it is very natural to argue in the more general setting , because the arguments do not use the group structure of the coxeter groups at all .",

    "<S> we define a new lattice structure @xmath0 on the elements of a finite coxeter group  @xmath1 this lattice , called the _ shard intersection order _ , is weaker than the weak order and has the noncrossing partition lattice @xmath2 as a sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> the new construction of @xmath2 yields a new proof that @xmath2 is a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the shard intersection order is graded and its rank generating function is the @xmath3-eulerian polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> many order - theoretic properties of @xmath0 , like mbius number , number of maximal chains , etc . , are exactly analogous to the corresponding properties of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a natural dimension - preserving bijection between simplices in the order complex of @xmath0 ( i.e.  chains in ) and simplices in a certain pulling triangulation of the @xmath3-permutohedron . restricting the bijection to the order complex of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> yields a bijection to simplices in a pulling triangulation of the @xmath3-associahedron .    the lattice @xmath0 is defined indirectly via the polyhedral geometry of the reflecting hyperplanes of  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , most of the results of the paper are proven in the more general setting of simplicial hyperplane arrangements . </S>"
