    "a standard implementation of astrod is to have two spacecraft in separate solar orbit carrying a payload of a proof mass , two telescopes , two 1 - 2 w lasers , a clock and a drag - free system , together with a similar l1/l2 spacecraft ( fig .  1)[1 , 2 ] .",
    "the three spacecraft range coherently with one another using lasers . simulation with timing error 50 ps and accelerometer error @xmath0 m / s@xmath1(hz)@xmath2 at frequency @xmath3 @xmath4 100@xmath5hz for 1050 days gives the uncertainties of determining relativistic parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and that for solar quadrupole parameter @xmath10 to be 1.2@xmath11 [ 3 ] . at present",
    ", satellite laser - ranging timing error has reached 5 ps .",
    "lisa s launching goal in 2012 for accelerometer noise requires 3 @xmath12 @xmath13 m / s@xmath1(hz)@xmath2 at @xmath3 @xmath4 100 @xmath5hz [ 4 ] . since astrod will be after 2012 , a factor of 3 improvement on lisa goal",
    "will make 2 orders of magnitude improvement for acceleration noise in the simulation .",
    "these will put the uncertainties of measuring @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 range , and that of @xmath10 in the 10@xmath16 to 10@xmath14 range .",
    "this demands post - post - newtonian ephemeris framework to be established for the analysis and simulation of data .",
    "efforts have been started in this direction by colleagues [ 5 - 7 ] .",
    "astrod i with one spacecraft interferometric ranging and pulse ranging with ground stations is the first step for a full astrod mission [ 8 ] .",
    "the goals are testing relativity with gamma measured to 10@xmath17 , measuring solar - system parameters more precisely and improving the sensitivity for gravitational wave detection using radio doppler tracking .",
    "the spacecraft is to be launched to encounter venus twice to achieve a shorter period for a sooner measurement of shapiro time delay ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the algorisms for unequal arm noise cancellation of armstrong , estabrook & tinto [ 9 , 10 ] , and of dhurandhar , nayak & vinet [ 11 ] can readily be applied to astrod . for the 3-spacecraft configuration as in lisa and as in fig .",
    "1 , they have demonstrated that one can combine the six measured time series of doppler shifts of the one - way laser beams between spacecraft pairs , and the six measured shifts between adjacent optical benches on each spacecraft , with suitable time delays , to cancel the laser frequency fluctuations , and opical - bench vibration noise . the achievable strain sensitivity for these combinations",
    "is set by the drag - free proof - mass accelerations inside optical benches , and by the shot noise at photodetectors .",
    "the implementation of these alogarisms for astrod requires the armlengths known accurately to about 100 m and the synchronization good to about 300 ns . since astrod is an astrometry mission , the armlengths and synchronizations will be measured and implemented to better than 10 ps accuracy .",
    "therefore , astrod can easily accommodate the noise cancellation algorisms even when shot noise and acceleration noise are improved significantly .    for 1 - 2 w laser emitting power ,",
    "the shot noise sensitivity floor in the strain is @xmath18/(hz)@xmath2 independent of armlength . with the same power , the astrod sensitivity",
    "would be shifted to lower frequency by a factor up to 60 ( 30 in average ) if other frequency - dependent requirements can be met .",
    "the antenna response will be shifted correspondingly .",
    "if the accelerometer noise response can be shifted , i.e. , the low - frequency response becomes better , we may have the astrod ( 2 ) sensitivity curve of fig .  1 as given in [ 12 ] .",
    "astrod has varying armlength and the sensitivity should be in a band and integration should be performed . if the lisa accelerometer noise goal is taken , the sensitivity at low frequency is about 30 times better than lisa as indicated in astrod ( 1 ) in fig .  1 , as given by r@xmath19diger [ 13 ] .",
    "since astrod is in a time frame later than lisa , if the absolute metrological accelerometer / inertial sensor can be developed , there is a potential to reach astrod ( 3 ) sensitivity curve . with a better lower - frequency resolution , the confusion limit for lisa should be lower for astrod .",
    "the modulations of signals due to orbit motions of astrod spacecraft , especially the radial motions , will help to distinguish gravity - gradient signals due to solar oscillation from gravitational - wave signals from outside the solar system [ 2 ] .",
    "a schematic payload configuration of astrod i is as in fig .  2 [ 14 ] . the cylindrical spacecraft with diameter 2.5",
    "m and height 2 m has its surface covered with solar panels . in orbit ,",
    "the cylindrical axis is perpendicular to the orbit plane with the telescope pointing toward the ground laser station .",
    "the effective area to receive sunlight is about 5 m@xmath20 and can generate over 500 w of power .",
    "the total mass of spacecraft is 300 - 350 kg .",
    "that of payload is 100 - 120 kg with science data rate 500 bps .",
    "the crucial technologies include ( i ) 100 fw weaklight phase locking [ 15 ] ; ( ii ) design and development of sunlight shield [ 8 ] ; ( iii ) design and development of drag - free system .",
    "the requirements for the drag - free system are less stringent than lisa . in table 1",
    "we provide a summary of the parameter values that meet the accelerometer requirements for astrod i , in comparison with lisa .",
    "we use the notations and the lisa values of schumaker [ 16 ] .",
    "the listed values are for the frequency at 0.1 mhz .",
    "the parameter values are largely relaxed for astrod i. the same values satisfy requirements for higher - frequency range , where frequency - dependent contributions to the acceleration noise become smaller .    @lll @xmath21 0.1 @xmath22 & * astrod i * & * lisa * + _ acceleration noise goal at 0.1 @xmath22 : _ @xmath23 [ @xmath24 & @xmath0 & @xmath25 + _ parameter values _ & & + * proof mass ( pm ) * + magnetic susceptibility : @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 + maximum charge build - up : @xmath29 [ @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath0 + residual gas pressure : @xmath32 [ @xmath33 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 + fluctuation of temperature difference across & & + pm and housing : @xmath34 [ @xmath35 ( at 0.1 @xmath22 ) & & + * spacecraft ( sc ) * + thruster noise [ @xmath36 ( at 0.1 @xmath22 ) & 0.5 & 0.1 + fluctuation of temperature in sc : @xmath37 [ @xmath35 ( at 0.1 @xmath22 ) & 0.4 & 0.004 + * capacitive sensing * + voltage difference between average voltage across opposite & & + faces and voltage to ground : @xmath38 [ @xmath39 & & + fluctuation of voltage difference across opposite faces : & & + @xmath40 [ @xmath41 ( at 0.1 @xmath22 ) & & + asymmetry in gap across opposite sides of pm : @xmath42 [ @xmath43 & 10 & 1 + * laser power * + fluctuation of laser power : @xmath44 [ @xmath45 ( at 0.1 @xmath22 ) & 2 @xmath12 @xmath28 & 2 @xmath12 @xmath46 +    a typical design orbit for august 4 , 2010 launch is shown on the left of fig  2 : two encounters with venus to swing the spacecraft to the other side of the sun to conduct shapiro time delay measurement and to measure venus multipole moments [ 17 ] . assuming a 10 ps timing accuracy and @xmath0 m / s@xmath1(hz)@xmath2 ( at @xmath3 @xmath47hz ) inertial sensor / accelerometer noise , our simulation of the accuracy for determining the relativistic parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the solar quadrupole parameter j@xmath48 gives 10@xmath17 , 10@xmath17 and 10@xmath15 , respectivly , for their uncertainties [ 17 ] .    like the radio doppler tracking of spacecraft [ 18 ] , astrod i also has sensitivity to low - frequency gravitational - wave .",
