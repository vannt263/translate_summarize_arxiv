    "let @xmath0 be an elliptic fibration on a smooth variety @xmath1 , i.e. a flat morphism whose generic fiber is a curve of genus one , and which has a section @xmath2 .",
    "the choice of such a section defines a poincare sheaf @xmath3 on @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding fourier - mukai transform @xmath5 is then an autoequivalence of the derived category @xmath6 of complexes of coherent sheaves on @xmath1 .",
    "it sets up an equivalence between @xmath7-bundles on @xmath1 and spectral data consisting of line bundles ( and their degenerations ) on spectral covers @xmath8 which are of degree @xmath9 over @xmath10 .",
    "this equivalence has been used extensively to construct vector bundles on elliptic fibrations and to study their moduli @xcite .    for many applications",
    "it is important to remove the requirement of the existence of a section , i.e. to allow genus one fibrations .",
    "this could be done in two ways .",
    "the ` spectrum ' of a degree zero semistable rank @xmath9 bundle on a genus one curve @xmath11 consists of @xmath9 points in the jacobian @xmath12 , rather than in @xmath13 itself .",
    "so one approach is to consider spectral covers @xmath14 contained in the relative jacobian @xmath15 .",
    "but the spectral data in this case no longer involves a line bundle on @xmath14 ; instead , it lives in a certain non - trivial gerbe , or twisted form of @xmath16 .",
    "so the essential problem becomes the analysis of this gerbe .",
    "the second approach is to find an elliptic fibration @xmath17 together with a group @xmath18 acting compatibly on @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( but not preserving the section of @xmath21 ) such that the action on @xmath19 is fixed point free and the quotient is the original @xmath0 .",
    "one can then use the fourier - mukai transform to construct vector bundles on @xmath19 .",
    "the problem becomes the determination of conditions for such a bundle on @xmath19 to be @xmath18-equivariant , hence to descend to @xmath1 .",
    "equivalently we need to know the action of each @xmath22 on spectral data .",
    "this is the restriction of the action on @xmath23 of the fourier - mukai conjugate @xmath24 of @xmath25 .",
    "this will be referred to as the _ spectral action _ of @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral action can be quite complicated : both global vector bundles on @xmath19 and sheaves supported on @xmath14 can go to complexes on @xmath19 of amplitude greater than one .    in this paper , we work out such a spectral action in one class of examples consisting of special rational elliptic surfaces . in the second part",
    "@xcite of this paper we use this analysis to construct special bundles on certain non - simply connected smooth calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "these special bundles in turn are the main ingredient for the construction of heterotic m - theory vacua having the standard model symmetry group @xmath27 and three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "the physical significance of such vacua is explained in @xcite and was the original motivation of this work .",
    "here is an outline of the paper .",
    "we begin in section  [ ss - dp9-general ] with a review of the basic properties of rational elliptic surfaces . within the eight dimensional moduli space of all rational elliptic surfaces we focus attention on a five dimensional family of rational elliptic surfaces admitting a particular involution @xmath28 , and then we restrict further to a four dimensional family of surfaces with reducible fibers .",
    "this seems to be the simplest family of surfaces for which one needs the full force of theorem  [ prop - t ] : for general surfaces in the five dimensional family , the spectral involution @xmath29 of @xmath28 takes line bundles to line bundles , while in the four dimensional subfamily it is possible for @xmath30 to take a line bundle to a complex which can not be represented by any single sheaf .",
    "we study the five dimensional family in section  [ ss - dp9-special ] and the four dimensional subfamily in section  [ s-4dim - family ] .",
    "this section concludes , in subsection  [ sss - synthetic ] , with a synthetic construction of the surfaces in the four dimensional subfamily .",
    "this construction maybe less motivated than the original a priori analysis we use , but it is more concise and we hope it will make the exposition more accessible .    in the remainder of the paper we work out the actions of @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 , first at the level of cohomology in sections  [ ss - dp9-cohoaction ] and [ s - cohofm ] , and then on the derived category in section  [ ss - dp9-bundleaction ] . the main result is theorem  [ prop - t ] , which says that @xmath30 behaves like a fairly simple affine transformation _",
    "away from the union of those fiber components which do not intersect the zero section_. a corollary is that for spectral curves which do not intersect the extra vertical components , all the complications disappear .",
    "this fact together with the cohomological formulas from sections [ ss - dp9-cohoaction ] and [ s - cohofm ] will be used in @xcite to build invariant vector bundles on a family of calabi - yau threefolds constructed from the rational elliptic surfaces in our four dimensional subfamily .",

    "a rational elliptic surface is a rational surface @xmath20 which admits an elliptic fibration @xmath32 .",

    "in particular the topological euler characteristic of @xmath20 is @xmath39 . for a generic @xmath20 the map @xmath36 has twelve distinct singular fibers each of which has a single node . for future use",

    "the curves @xmath50 are sections of the map @xmath32 . choosing a section @xmath51 determines a group law on the fibers of @xmath52 .",
    "the inversion for this group law is an involution on @xmath53 which for a general @xmath20 extends to a well defined involution @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath20 or @xmath55 are understood from the context we will just write @xmath56 or @xmath57 . the involution @xmath58 fixes the section @xmath55 as well as a tri - section of @xmath36 which parameterizes the non - trivial points of order two .",
    "the quotient @xmath59 is a smooth rational surface which is ruled over the base @xmath60 . for a general @xmath20",
    "this quotient is the hirzebruch surface @xmath61 and the image of @xmath55 is the exceptional section of @xmath61 .",

    "note that the natural map @xmath89 } \\mapsto { \\mathcal o}_{b}(\\xi).\\ ] ] is not a group homomorphism .",
    "when written out in coordinates , it involves both a linear part and a quadratic term ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , when @xmath20 is smooth the map @xmath90 induces a linear map to a quotient of @xmath91 which describes @xmath86 completely .",
    "indeed , let @xmath20 be smooth and let @xmath92 be the sublattice generated by @xmath55 and all the components of the fibers of @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath90 induces a map @xmath93 } \\mapsto ( { \\mathcal o}_{b}(\\xi)\\!\\!\\!\\mod{\\mathcal t})\\ ] ] which is a linear isomorphism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.3 )    there is a natural group homomorphism @xmath94 assigning to each section @xmath95 the birational automorphism @xmath96 , which on the open set @xmath53 is just translation by @xmath97 with respect to the group law determined by @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath84 is relatively minimal the map @xmath98 extends canonically to a biregular automorphism of @xmath20 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.9 ) .",
    "in the second part of this paper @xcite we will work with calabi - yau threefolds @xmath19 which are elliptically fibered over a rational elliptic surface @xmath20 .",
    "any involution @xmath99 on an elliptic cy @xmath100 commuting with @xmath21 induces ( either the identity or ) an involution @xmath101 on the base @xmath20 . in order for @xmath99 to act freely on @xmath19",
    "we need the fixed points of @xmath102 to be disjoint from the discriminant of @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath20 is a rational elliptic surface , then the discriminant of @xmath21 is a section in @xmath103 and so @xmath56 will not do .",
    "we want to describe some special rational elliptic surfaces which admit additional involutions . within the @xmath104 dimensional family of rational elliptic surfaces we describe first a @xmath105 dimensional family of surfaces which admit an involution @xmath106 .",
    "the fixed locus of @xmath106 has the right properties but it turns out that @xmath106 does not lift to a free involution on @xmath19 .",
    "however , one can easily show that each @xmath106 can be corrected by a translation @xmath107 ( for a special type of section @xmath108 ) to obtain an additional involution @xmath102 which does the job .",
    "unfortunately the general member of the @xmath105 dimensional family leads to a calabi - yau manifold which does not admit any bundles satisfying all the constraints required by the standard model of particle physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore specialize further to a @xmath109 dimensional family of surfaces for which the extra involution @xmath102 can be constructed in an explicit geometric way .",
    "this provides some extra freedom which enables us to carry out the construction .",
    "the involution @xmath106 fixes one fiber of @xmath36 and four points in another fiber .",
    "the involution @xmath102 fixes only four points in one fiber .",
    "a special feature of the @xmath109 dimensional family is that it consists of @xmath20 s for which @xmath36 has at least two @xmath110 fibers .",
    "this translates into a special position requirement on the nine points in @xmath33 .",
    "another special feature of the @xmath109 dimensional family is seen in the double cover realization of @xmath20 where the quotient @xmath111 becomes @xmath112 instead of @xmath61 .",
    "we thank chad schoen for pointing out that essentially the same surfaces and threefolds were constructed in section 9 of @xcite .",
    "the explicit example he gives there for what he calls the `` @xmath113 case '' happens to exactly coincide with our four - dimensional family of rational elliptic surfaces . with small modifications",
    ", his construction could have given our full five - dimensional family as well .",
    "schoen s construction technique is rather different than ours .",
    "he constructs the equivalent of our rational elliptic surface @xmath20 and involution @xmath114 directly ( the surfaces we call @xmath115 are called @xmath116 in @xcite ) ; then he invokes a general result of ogg and shafarevich for the existence of a logarithmic transform @xmath117 with quotient @xmath118 ; and finally , results from classification theory are used to deduce existence of an abstract isomorphism of @xmath117 with @xmath119 such that his @xmath118 becomes our @xmath120 .    in the next several sections we will describe the structure of the rational elliptic surfaces that admit additional involutions .",
    "this rather extensive geometric analysis is ultimately distilled into a fairly simple synthetic construction of our surfaces which is explained in section  [ sss - synthetic ] .",
    "the impatient reader who is interested only in the end result of the construction and wants to avoid the tedious geometric details is advised to skip directly to section [ sss - synthetic ] .      consider a smooth rational elliptic surface @xmath121 ^ -{\\beta } & { \\mathbb p}^{1 } \\ar@/^0.5pc/[l]^-{e}}$ ] with a fixed section .",
    "for any automorphism @xmath102 of @xmath20 we have @xmath122 .",
    "since @xmath123 this implies that @xmath102 induces an automorphism @xmath124 . if @xmath102 is an involution we have two possibilities : either @xmath125 or @xmath126 is an involution of @xmath127 .",
    "both of these cases occur and lead to calabi - yau manifolds with freely acting involutions . for concreteness here we only treat the case when @xmath128 is an involution .",
