    "the presence of cluster - wide magnetic fields and relativistic electrons in cluster of galaxies is revealed by the detection of radio halos in the center of some clusters of galaxies .",
    "radio halos are diffuse , extended radio sources associated with the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) rather than with a particular galaxy .",
    "the physical mechanism producing the population of radio - synchrotron emitting relativistic electrons is not yet determined .",
    "however , it is clear from cooling time arguments that such mechanism has to operate in the icm , in order to explain the large extensions ( @xmath0 1mpc ) of radio halos .    in general ,",
    "clusters containing radio halos are characterized by the presence of a recent merger event , that probably provides the energy source for the relativistic electrons , by the absence of strong cooling flows and by high x - ray luminosity ( feretti 2000 ) .",
    "several suggestions for the mechanism transferring energy to the relativistic electrons have been made ( see enlin ( 2000 ) for a recent review ) .",
    "these include in - situ acceleration by plasma and by shock waves , particle injection from radio galaxies , acceleration out of the thermal pool , secondary electrons resulting from hadronic collisions of relativistic protons with the icm gas protons , and combinations of these processes .",
    "it is , therefore , important to establish observable quantities which allow a discrimination between these models .",
    "important observable quantities used so far in the literature are : the global radio spectral index , the emission and spectral index profile , the total radio power and its correlation to cluster parameters such as temperature or x - ray luminosity .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present a new observable quantity : the point - to - point correlation of the radio and the x - ray surface brightness in clusters containing radio halos .",
    "its suitability is demonstrated by the striking similarities of the radio halo morphology and the thermal x - ray emission of halo clusters .",
    "these morphological similarities indicate an energetical relation between the thermal gas and the relativistic plasma .",
    "this observable is straightforward to determine from observational data , can be constrained by theoretical models and does not depend on any assumption .",
    "we present in sect .",
    "2 the methodological approach of the radio - x - ray comparison .",
    "the results are given in sect .",

    "so far , the similarity of the radio halo and the x - ray morphology of the clusters has been pointed out in the literature ( deiss et al .",
    "1997 , feretti 1999 , liang et al .",
    "2000 ) but it has never been used to constrain theoretical models .    here",
    "we present the first quantitative analysis of the relation between the radio and the x - ray brightness distribution .",
    "we carried out such analysis for the following four clusters : coma ( abell 1656 ) , abell 2255 , abell 2319 , and abell 2744 , whose properties are summarized in table 1 .    except for a2744 , we analyzed already published radio and x - ray images",
    "therefore , we refer to the previous works for the details of the radio and x - ray data .    the analyzed x - ray surface brightness images were obtained in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev energy band ( only the coma surface brightness image was obtained in the 0.5 - 2.4 kev energy band ) .",
    "the x - ray background was taken into account in the analysis of the x - ray images .",
    "the presence of a visible sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect was established in three of our four clusters ( see table 1 ) . however",
    ", the radio halo surface brightness is not corrected for a sz effect contamination since this is significant only for frequencies higher than 5 ghz .",
    "the images discussed here have been obtained at much lower frequencies ( 0.3 or 1.4 ghz ) .",

    "we used radio images where discrete sources were subtracted using the aips package , while in the other two clusters discrete radio sources were excluded from the analysis with the help of the synage++ program .    for each cluster",

    "a larger grid cell does not change the fitting results . however , since this approach of counts in cells involves spatial averaging , this kind of analysis is insensitive to scale features smaller than the cell size .    due to",
    "some degree of morphological difference between the radio and x - ray images deviations from a tight correlation exist , which appear as scatter in the @xmath9-@xmath10 plots . however , most of the outlayers have radio fluxes below the 3 sigma noise level",

    "moreover , we found a linear relation between the radio and the x - ray brightness in two clusters of galaxies ( a2255 , a2744 ) .",
    "the appearance of radio halos seems to be correlated to the occurrence of cluster mergers ( feretti et al .",
    "1997b ) , which suggests that cluster mergers could be the key of the connection between the thermal and the relativistic components in the clusters .",
    "in the following we demonstrate how some simple assumptions can lead to a linear relation between the radio and the x - ray brightness .",
    "most of the thermal energy content of a galaxy cluster results from the dissipation of the kinetic energy of gas falling into the cluster potential .",
    "the dissipation occurs in shock waves and turbulent cascades , which are strongest in the case of major cluster merger events .",
    "some small fraction of the dissipated energy might go into the amplification of magnetic fields due to field line stretching in shear flows ( roettiger et al .",
    "1999 , dolag et at .",
    "another fraction might go into relativistic particle populations via fermi i or ii acceleration .",
    "the rest of the dissipated energy is thermalized in the hot icm .",
    "let us assume for simplicity , that the energy fraction which goes into the non - thermal components ( fields and relativistic particles ) compared to the thermal component is independent of the position in a cluster .",
    "this assumption needs not to hold in reality , but it allows us to construct simple test models , for comparison with observations .",
    "the x - ray emissivity in a cluster is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the electron density and temperature .",
    "for an isothermal cluster the x - ray emissivity at a given position is proportional to the thermal energy density ( @xmath36 ) squared : @xmath37    if the number density of relativistic electrons with energy between @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be assumed to be @xmath40 the radio emissivity at a given position in a cluster is given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the frequency and @xmath43 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "in general , for each value of @xmath44 , the observationally obtained linear relation @xmath45 implies that the relativistic particles and the magnetic field are connected to the thermal plasma through the relation : @xmath46    such a relation must be approximately fulfilled in a2255 and a2744 . in the other two clusters ,",
    "the relations obtained between @xmath9 and @xmath10 seem to imply that the radial decline of the magnetic field strength and relativistic particle density is slower than the decline of thermal gas density .    in the following",
    "we assume for simplicity a single radio spectral index ( @xmath47 ) which is typical for cluster radio halos .",
    "therefore the radio emissivity at frequency @xmath42 is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the relativistic electron energy density , and @xmath50 is the local magnetic field ( @xmath43 ) energy density .",
    "if we assume  as suggested above  that magnetic fields and radio emitting electrons have energy densities proportional to the thermal energy content ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) we find that the ratio @xmath53 is independent of the position within an isothermal cluster .",
    "the same is true for the ratio of the surface brightnesses @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are the line - of - sight projected emissivities .",
    "thus @xmath54 as observed at least in two of our cases .",
    "such a linear relation might be obtained by some of the primary electron models where the energy density in relativistic electrons is proportional to the thermal energy density .    in hadronic secondary electron models",
    "the radio emitting electrons are secondary particles produced in hadronic cosmic ray proton - gas interactions ( see review enlin 2000 ) . in these models",
    "the radio emissivity is given by ( dolag & enlin 2000 ) : @xmath55 assuming @xmath56 .",
    "this more complicated dependence results from the fact that the spectrum of the radio emitting electrons is shaped by the parent cosmic ray proton spectrum , here assumed to be a power - law , and by the electron cooling processes .",
    "these are mainly due to synchrotron losses ( @xmath57 ) and to inverse compton scattering with the cmb photon field ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we assume further that the cosmic ray proton population has an energy density proportional to that of the thermal component ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the resulting ratio of the radio and x - ray emissivities @xmath60 is independent of the magnetic energy density for strong fields ( @xmath61 ) , and proportional to it for weak fields ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , for a radial decreasing magnetic field strength we expect a linear relation between the radio and the x - ray brightness in the case of strong magnetic fields , while we expect a super - linear power law in the case of weak magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , for a magneto - hydrodynamically simulated coma - like cluster of galaxies with intermediate field strength ( @xmath63 ) , which is consistent with published faraday rotation measurements , dolag & enlin ( 2000 ) get a radio to x - ray surface brightness relation of @xmath64 .",
    "the prediction of this specific version of hadronic secondary electron models is in contradiction with the data analysis presented here .",
    "we analyzed radio and x - ray images of four clusters of galaxies on a point - to - point and also on a circular averaged ( radial profile ) basis .",
    "we argue that the point - to - point comparison is less affected by morphological distortions , and that it allows to introduce a radio vs x - ray surface brightness relation ( @xmath65-@xmath13 relation ) .",
    "this was found to be consistent with a linear relation in two clusters ( abell 2555 : @xmath66 ; abell 2744 : @xmath67 ) and to be a sub - linear power law in the other two analyzed clusters ( coma : @xmath68 ; abell 2319 : @xmath69 ) .",
    "we note that in the case of coma the relation could be affected by the low signal to noise ratio of the used radio map .",
    "we presented two simplified cluster radio halo models : a primary electron and a hadronic secondary electron model . in both models we assumed that the magnetic fields and the primary particle population ( electrons in the primary model , the parent protons in the hadronic secondary model ) have energy densities proportional to the thermal energy density .",
    "the predicted @xmath65-@xmath13 relations of these models are linear for the primary model and for the hadronic secondary model in the regime of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the hadronic secondary model with weak or moderate field strength ( @xmath63 ) and with an assumed linear scalings of the thermal and non - thermal ( relativistic electrons and magnetic fields ) energy densities produces a super - linear power law @xmath65-@xmath13 relation , and it is therefore disfavored by the data analysis presented here .",
    "we hope that the point - to - point radio vs x - ray surface brightness relation will prove a useful observational and theoretical tool for future studies of the mysterious nature of cluster radio halos and of the non - thermal energy content of clusters of galaxies .",
