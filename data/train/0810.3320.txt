    "searches for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in hadron collisions cover a variety of final states , in particular in events with a photon and a large missing transverse energy ( )  @xcite .",
    "the large  is associated with particles that weakly interact with matter and leave the detector undetected . in supersymmetric ( susy ) models they are the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp ) , the natural candidates to account for the dark matter  @xcite . in models with large extra dimensions which provide a solution to the hierarchy problem they are the kaluza - klein gravitons  @xcite",
    ". a photon can be produced at the collision point ( prompt photon ) or away from it , like in a decay of a heavy long - lived particle , in which case it is detected later in time ( delayed photon ) .",
    "other contributions to the @xmath0  signature in cdf are from non - collision sources : a high energy muon from beam or from cosmic ray interactions can radiate in the detector and be misidentified as a photon ( a beam halo or a cosmic photon respectively ) .",
    "each type of photons has a unique distribution of the time they reach the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "this time can be measured by the emtiming system installed in 2005  @xcite . here",
    "i present two analyses which benefit the most from the emtiming system .",
    "the first analysis is a search for delayed photons motivated by the model with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , performed in the @xmath6  signature using 570  @xmath7  of data  @xcite .",
    "the second is a search in the exclusive @xmath0  signature motivated by the model with large extra dimensions ( led ) , performed using 2  @xmath8  of data  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the cdf detector can be found in ref .",
    "the vertexing and the tracking detectors surrounding the interaction region placed in solenoidal magnetic field of 1.4  @xmath9   are used to reconstruct trajectories of charged particles and measure their momenta and points of origin . further out are the calorimeters with electromagnetic and hadronic longitudinal segmentation used to identify and measure photons , electrons , and jets .",
    "the emtiming system is used to measure the calorimeter signal time with resolution of 0.5  @xmath10  and a threshold of about 3  @xmath11 .",
    "placed outside the calorimeter are the muon detectors used to identify muons from the collisions and cosmic rays .",
    "a search for delayed photons  @xcite is motivated by the gmsb model in which the lightest neutralino @xmath12 decays to a photon and a gravitino @xmath13 . given the resolution of the emtiming system and the cdf detector geometry the sensitivity to the delayed photons is the best for a proper lifetime of the @xmath12 in the nanosecond range .",
    "this range is consistent with the mass of the gravitino to be in the @xmath14  range which would explain the dark matter abundance . in @xmath1",
    "collisions the @xmath12 s are produced in chain decays of heavier particles and the events with @xmath0   are expected to have some additional activity in the calorimeter .",
    "the pre - selected events are required to have an isolated photon with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the missing energy of @xmath17 , a jet with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and a vertex with track-@xmath20  above 15  @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the backgrounds are from events with prompt , beam halo , and cosmic photons .",
    "the photon time @xmath22 , measured relative to the vertex time , is used to discriminate the signal from the backgrounds .",
    "the contributions from each background are predicted from the @xmath22 distributions extracted from data outside the region of @xmath23 . the expected contribution from the gmsb",
    "is estimated using simulation for points in the @xmath24 space .    the optimal event selection in @xmath25 , and the angular separation between the  and the jet vectors @xmath26 is chosen to provide the minimal expected upper limit on the @xmath12 production cross section at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) for the highest @xmath27 expected to be excluded .",
    "it is found to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "two events pass this selection compared to @xmath30 events expected from @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 events of the prompt , cosmic , and beam halo photon backgrounds respectively .",
    "the expected and observed exclusion regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] , together with the exclusion region expected from a future analysis which would probe the region where the gravitino can be the dark matter particle .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "a search in events with  and a prompt photon  @xcite is motivated by the led model  @xcite . in this case a graviton produced in a @xmath1  collision recoils against a photon and leaves the detector undetected . since the graviton momentum can have a component in extra spacial dimensions , it is visible in our space - time as a massive particle . in the led model",
    "the graviton mass spectrum is essentially continuous and a large number of modes contribute to high energy interactions with a production rate potentially observable at the tevatron depending on the number of extra dimensions @xmath34 and the fundamental mass parameter @xmath35 .",
    "pre - selected @xmath0  events are required to have one photon with @xmath36 and @xmath16 and @xmath37 .",
    "events from non - collision sources are suppressed by requiring a collision vertex with at least 3 tracks , and the photon time to be within 3  @xmath10  from the expected collision time .",
    "contributions from cosmic rays are additionally suppressed using hits in the muon systems and measurements in the calorimeter .",
    "contributions from the beam halo are suppressed by topological event selections to a negligible level .",
    "the remaining backgrounds are coming from @xmath1  collisions .",
    "the only irreducible background coming from @xmath38 production , where @xmath39 , is estimated from simulation .",
    "other prompt photon backgrounds are either from events with particles misidentified as a photon or from events with a mismeasured  from an object ( a lepton , photon , or a jet ) lost in an uninstrumented region .",
    "these backgrounds are suppressed by requiring no jets with @xmath40 and no tracks with @xmath41 . the contribution from @xmath42 , where the electron is identified as the photon ,",
    "is estimated from the electron sample scaled by the misidentification rate . the contribution from cosmics",
    "is estimated using events with the photon time away from the collision time .",
    "except for @xmath43 , which is estimated from simulation , the number of events with a lost object is derived from events in data with this object identified , scaled by the simulated rate for it to be lost .",
    "after a selection optimized for the best 95% upper limit , corresponding to the photon @xmath44 , 40 events are observed compared to @xmath45 expected from the background contributions .",
    "the expected number of background events are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 coming from @xmath50 , cosmics , a lost object , and a lepton from a @xmath51 decay misidentified as a photon respectively .",
    "the constraints on the led shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] are comparable to those provided by a similar analysis of @xmath52  events and can be combined for a better limit .",
    "among the recent searches for physics beyond the sm in events with @xmath0 , the search for delayed photons motivated by the gmsb and the search for prompt photons motivated by the led benefit the most from the measurements provided by the emtiming system installed at cdf in 2005 . the search for delayed photons employs purely data - driven background estimation methods and provides the best reach in @xmath12 mass with a proper lifetime of about 5  @xmath10 . similar analysis performed with more data",
    "is expected to probe extensively the region consistent with the gravitino being the dark matter particle .",
    "the search in the exclusive @xmath0  signature provides constraints on the led model comparable to those from a similar analysis in the @xmath52  signature .      99",
