    "penetration losses due to densely located buildings make it hard to predict coverage of cellular networks in urban areas .",
    "such blockage effects become more severe in systems of higher frequencies , and may limit performance of emerging millimeter - wave cellular networks @xcite . blockages impact system functions like user association and mobility . for instance , a mobile user may associate with a further base station with line - of - sight transmission rather than a closer base station that is blocked . traditionally , blockage effects are incorporated into the shadowing model , along with reflections , scattering , and diffraction @xcite .",
    "shadowing of different links is often modeled by using a log - normal distributed random variable , with the variance determined from measurements .",
    "unfortunately , this approach does not capture the distance - dependence of blockage effects : intuitively speaking , the longer the link , the more buildings are likely to intersect it , hence more shadowing is likely to be experienced .    cellular networks are becoming less regular as a variety of demand - based low power nodes are being deployed @xcite .",
    "moreover , as urban areas are built out , even the locations of the macro and micro base stations are becoming random and less like points in a hexagonal grid @xcite .",
    "mathematical tools like stochastic geometry make it possible to analyze cellular networks with randomly located infrastructure @xcite . with stochastic geometry",
    ", the locations of the infrastructure are often assumed to be distributed according to a spatial point process , usually a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) for tractability . in @xcite , a shotgun cellular system in which base stations are distributed as a ppp",
    "was shown to lower bound a hexagonal system in terms of certain performance metrics .",
    "in@xcite , analytical expressions were proposed to compute average performance metrics , such as the coverage probability and the average rate , of a cellular network with ppp distributed base stations .",
    "the results of @xcite were extended to multi - tier networks in @xcite . in @xcite , a hybrid model in which only interferers are modeled as a ppp outside a fixed - size cell",
    "was proposed to characterize the site - specific performance of cells with different sizes , rather than the aggregate performance metrics of the entire system .",
    "the stochastic geometry model was also applied to investigate the topic of network connectivity @xcite .",
    "one limitation of prior work in @xcite is that penetration losses due to buildings in urban areas were not explicitly incorporated .",
    "blockage effects were either neglected for simplicity @xcite or incorporated into a log - normal shadowing random variable @xcite .",
    "there are two popular approaches to incorporate blockages on wireless propagation .",
    "one method is using ray tracing to perform site - specific simulations @xcite .",
    "ray tracing requires accurate terrain information , such as the location and size of the blockages in the network to generate the received signal strength given a base station deployment .",
    "ray tracing trades the complexity of numerical computation for an accurate site - specific solution .",
    "the second approach is to establish a stochastic model to characterize the statistics of blockages that provides acceptable estimation of the blockage effects with only a few parameters .",
    "an advantage of stochastic models is that it may be possible to analyze general networks . in @xcite ,",
    "urban areas were modeled as random lattices , which are made up of sites of unit squares .",
    "each site is occupied by a blockage with some probability .",
    "it was assumed that signals reflect when impinging blockages with no power losses .",
    "methods from percolation theory were applied to derive a closed - form expression of the propagation depth into the random lattice .",
    "the study did not take penetration losses into account .",
    "moreover , its application is better suited for regular manhattan - type cities where all blockages on the plane have a similar size and orientation . in @xcite , the lattice model from @xcite",
    "was extended by removing some of the restrictions .",
    "a constant power loss of signal was assumed when it impinged at the blockages .",
    "orientations of blockages were also randomly distributed .",
    "such refinements were achieved by representing blockages as nuclei from a point process , where the difference of the sizes of the blockages was not explicitly incorporated .",
    "in addition , a common limitation found in prior work is that the building height is ignored by restricting the model to the plane of @xmath0 . the models in @xcite are not compatible with stochastic geometry network model that provides a convenient analysis of cellular networks @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to propose a mathematical framework to model blockages with random sizes , locations , and orientations in cellular networks using concepts from random shape theory .",
    "we remove the restrictions on the orientations and sizes of the blockages as in prior lattice models .",
    "specifically , random buildings in urban area are modeled as a process of rectangles with random sizes and orientations whose centers form a ppp , which is more general than the line segment process we used previously in @xcite .",
    "we also extend the blockage model to incorporate the height of the transmitter , receiver , and buildings .",
    "the proposed framework extends to more general cases where blockages need not be rectangles but may be any convex shape .",
    "the proposed blockage model is also compatible with the ppp cellular network model to analyze network - level performance .",
    "based on the proposed model , we derive the distribution of power loss due to blockages in a link and apply it to analyze the performance of cellular networks with impenetrable blockages .",
    "analytical results indicate that while buildings complicate the propagation environment by blocking line - of - sight links , they improve system performance in covered area by blocking more interference .",
    "the main limitation of our work is that we only consider the direct propagation path , and ignore signal reflections , which are an component of wireless transmission .",
    "we defer the incorporation of reflections as a topic of future work .",
    "we also assume that the blockages experienced by a link are independent , which neglects correlation induced by large buildings .",
    "simulation results show that the error of such approximation is minor and acceptable . compared with our prior work in @xcite , in this paper",
    "we provide a general mathematical framework to model random blockages , and evaluate the network performance with blockages more precisely , which is based on the distribution rather than the moments of interference .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , after reviewing some concepts from random shape theory , we describe the system model where blockages are modeled as a random process of rectangles . in section [ sec : quantif ] , we derive the distribution of blockage number on a link , and apply it to quantify penetration losses of a link .",
    "we also extend results to incorporate height of the blockage . in section",
    "[ apply ] , we analyze blockage effects on a specific case of cellular networks in which blockages are impenetrable to signals , in terms of coverage probability , average achievable rate , and network connectivity .",

    "we take a 400 @xmath276 400 @xmath277 snapshot of the university of texas at austin campus from google map . in this area ,",
    "the buildings take up 26.6@xmath278 of the total size , and their average size is @xmath279 @xmath269 .",
    "the parameters of the proposed boolean scheme model and the lattice model are taken to match the statistics of the real buildings .",
    "we assume the base stations form a ppp with an average cell radius of @xmath271 m. we simulate the coverage probability of an outdoor user located at the center of the area .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : real_simu ] that ignoring thermal noise causes minor errors in the simulation , for the dense deployment of base stations renders the network interference - limited .",
    "simulation results also show that the boolean scheme model may fit the real scenarios better than the lattice model , for it can incorporate the random size and location of the buildings .",
    "next , we consider how impenetrable blockages impact cellular networks .",
    "simulations of the network connectivity , in terms of the average visible area and the fraction of the silent area in a network are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : visible ] as a function of the density and size of the blockages .",
    "results in fig . [",
    "fig : visible ] indicate that the existence of blockages will limit the range of line - of - sight links , and increase the size of the silent area in a network .",
    "though the existence of the blockages decreases the network connectivity , however , it may be helpful to increase the coverage probability and achievable rate as shown in the following simulations .    [ !",

    "uniformly distributed in the simulations .",
    "the error is small in the practically relevant sir regime between -5db and 5db . ]",
    "we present a comparison of the coverage probability between monte carlo simulations and the analytical results from section [ apply ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : coveragesim ] . the minor difference between the curves",
    "are caused by neglecting correlations of blockage effects on different links in the analysis .",
    "the small error seems to be a reasonable compromise between fidelity and simulation time , since it takes more than 3 hours to run a monte carlo simulation of 10000 samples , and less than 1 minute to evaluate the coverage using the analytical expression .    [ !",
    "ht ]    , where @xmath280 the baseline curve with no blockages is derived according to @xcite . when the base station density is @xmath281 , a remarkable performance gain in coverage probability is observed over the baseline curve , which indicates blockages sometimes help to improve performance of urban networks . ]",
    "the coverage probability is compared as a function of base station density , with and without blockages in fig .",
    "[ fig : coverage ] . when blockages are not considered in the system model , prior work in @xcite concluded that the coverage probability is invariant with the base station density .",
    "when blockages are included , however , the sir distribution becomes dependent on the base station density , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coverage ] .",
    "an interesting result is that blockages often help improve coverage .",
    "this apparently counter - intuitive result can be explained by the distance - dependent behavior of blockage .",
    "since we assume the user always connects to the nearest available base station , the interference link is always longer than the desired - signal link .",
    "thus it is likely that there are more blockages on the interference link .",
    "then a large portion of interference power will be blocked from the mobile user than that of the signal power .",
    "another interesting result is the coverage probability as a function of different base station densities @xmath27 and 10@xmath27 : increasing the number of base stations deployed in a region , sometimes leads to a degradation of performance .",
    "this simulation result indicates that , with a fixed blockage density , the optimum base station density to achieve best network performance is finite .",
    "another observation is that when the base station density goes to infinity , the coverage probability converges to the case with no blockages .",
    "since the locations of the base stations and buildings form two independent homogeneous ppps , increasing base station density to infinity with a fixed blockage density is equivalent to decreasing the blockages density to zero with some base station density .",
    ".average rate comparison with @xmath282 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     simulation results of the average rate provide similar insight that , considering blockage effects , the average rate is no longer invariant with base station density , and that blockages may help increase the achievable rate , as shown in table [ table : rate ] .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a stochastic framework to model random blockages in urban cellular networks using concepts from random shape theory .",
    "the key idea is to model the random buildings as a boolean scheme of rectangles , which allows for a comprehensive characterization of the randomness of the blockages , such as sizes , locations , orientations , and heights .",
    "based on the blockage model , we derived the distribution of the penetration loss in a link , and proposed path loss formulas that incorporate the blockage effect in different scenarios .",
    "the proposed model captured the distance - dependent feature of the blockage effects .",
    "analysis of the performance in cellular networks with impenetrable blockages indicates that blockages change the behavior of cellular networks in an important way , such as reducing the network connectivity and removing the invariance with base station density in terms of sir distribution .",
    "our results illustrate that cellular networks may benefit from blockages , since the longer path lengths to interfering base stations may have more blockages . for future work",
    ", it would be interesting to extend these results to multi - tier networks .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider the case where the infrastructure is deployed with some relationship to the blockages , for example small cells could be deployed inside blockages or base stations could be deployed on the perimeters of blockages .",
