    "neutrino flavor oscillations have been observed in many solar , reactor and accelerator experiments ( see the recent reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in agreement with the currently standard paradigm of three - neutrino ( @xmath2 ) mixing .",
    "the global fits of neutrino oscillation data in the framework of @xmath2 mixing @xcite give us rather precise information on the values of the elements of the three mixing angles which parameterize the neutrino mixing matrix and on the values of the two independent neutrino squared - mass differences , the smaller `` solar '' squared - mass difference @xmath4 and the larger `` atmospheric '' squared - mass difference @xmath5 .",
    "however , the standard @xmath2 mixing paradigm has been challenged by indications in favor of short - baseline oscillations generated by a new larger squared - mass difference @xmath6 : the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite , which is a deficit of the rate of @xmath7 observed in several short - baseline reactor neutrino experiments in comparison with that expected from the latest calculation of the reactor neutrino fluxes @xcite ; the gallium neutrino anomaly @xcite , consisting in a short - baseline disappearance of @xmath8 measured in the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex @xcite and sage @xcite ; the signal of short - baseline @xmath9 oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "the simplest extension of @xmath2 mixing which can describe these short - baseline oscillations taking into account other constraints is the 3 + 1 mixing scheme @xcite , in which there is an additional massive neutrino at the ev scale and the masses of the three standard neutrinos are much smaller .",
    "since from the lep measurement of the invisible width of the @xmath10 boson we know that there are only three active neutrinos ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in the flavor basis the additional massive neutrino corresponds to a sterile neutrino @xcite , which does not have standard weak interactions .    a fundamental questions that remains open",
    "is : are neutrinos dirac or majorana particles ?",
    "this question can not be investigated in neutrino oscillation experiments , where the total lepton number is conserved and there is no difference between dirac neutrinos with a conserved total lepton number and truly neutral majorana neutrinos , which do not have a conserved total lepton number . the most promising process which can reveal the majorana nature of neutrinos is neutrinoless double - beta decay , in which the total lepton number changes by two units ( see the recent review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from the present knowledge of the neutrino squared - mass differences and mixing angles it is possible to predict the possible range of values for the effective majorana mass @xmath0 in neutrinoless double - beta decay as a function of the absolute scale of neutrino masses",

    "the introduction of a sterile neutrino at the ev mass scale can change dramatically the prediction for the possible range of values for the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double - beta decay @xcite . in this paper",

    "@xcite ) , and the conditions for which there can be a cancellation of the different mass contributions to @xmath0 , which leads to an unfortunate uncertainty for the possibility of ever observing neutrinoless double - beta decay ( unless it is induced by new interactions and/or the exchange of new particles ; see refs .",

    "we discuss how these predictions are modified in the 3 + 1 mixing framework . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in the standard three - neutrino ( @xmath2 ) mixing framework , the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double - beta decay is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the partial contribution of the massive majorana neutrino @xmath14 with mass @xmath15 .",
