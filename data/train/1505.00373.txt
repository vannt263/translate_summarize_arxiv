    "following the high redshift supernovae data in the last decade  @xcite we know that when interpreted within the framework of the standard frw type of universe ( homogeneous and isotropic ) we are left with the only alternative that the universe is now going through an accelerated expansion with baryonic matter contributing only @xmath6 of the total budget .",
    "later data from cmbr studies  @xcite further corroborate this conclusion which has led a vast chunk of cosmology community (  @xcite and references therein ) to embark on a quest to explain the cause of the acceleration .",
    "in fact the studies on accelerated expansion and its possible interpretations from different angles have been reigning the research paradigm for the last few decades .",
    "the teething problem now confronting researchers in this field is the identification of the mechanism that triggered the late inflation .",
    "but as they are already discussed extensively in the literature ( we are sparing the readers here to repeat once again those arguments ) all the alternatives face serious theoretical problems in some form or other .    in the literature a good number of dark energy models are proposed but little is precisely known about its origin . nowadays",
    ", the dark energy problem remains one of the major unsolved problems of theoretical physics  @xcite . on the way of searching for possible solutions of this problem various models",
    "are explored during last few decades referring to e.g. new exotic forms of matter ( _ e.g. _ quintessence )  @xcite , phantom  @xcite , holographic models  @xcite , string theory landscape  @xcite , born - infeld quantum condensate  @xcite , modified gravity approaches  @xcite , inhomogeneous spacetime  @xcite , higher dimensional space time  @xcite etc .",
    "while the above mentioned alternatives to address the observed acceleration of the current phase have both positive and negative aspects a number of papers have come up taking into account the chaplygin gas  @xcite as a new form of matter field to simulate unified dark energy and dark matter model",
    ". it is presumed that for gravitational attraction , the dark matter component is responsible for galaxy structure formation while dark energy provides necessary repulsive force for current accelerated expansion .    motivated by the desire to explain away the observational fallouts better and better the form of the equation of state ( in short , eos ) of matter is later generalised in stages first through the addition of an arbitrary constant with an exponent over the mass density , generally referred to as generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg )  @xcite . barring the serious disqualification _",
    "e.g. _ , it violates the time honoured principle of energy conditions , it is fairly successful to interpret the observational results coming out of gravitational lensing or recent cmbr and sne data in varied cosmic probes via the fine tuning of the value of the newly introduced arbitrary constant .",
    "the form of eos is again modified through the addition of an ordinary mater field , which is termed in the literature as modified chaplygin gas ( mcg )  @xcite , claiming an even better match with observational results .",
    "it may be appropriate at this stage to call attention to a recent work by guo and zhang  @xcite where a very generalised form of the chaplygin gas relation is invoked , assuming the constant @xmath7 to depend on the scale factor @xmath4 .",
    "e.g._,@xmath8 , it is shown that for a very large value of the scale factor the model interpolates between a dust - dominated phase and a quiessence phase ( i.e. , dark energy with a constant equation of state )  @xcite given by @xmath9 .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "although different variants of dark energy models as well as chaplygin type of gas models are brought in the cosmological arena as also its associated success to explain the observations coming out of different cosmic probes it has not escaped our notice that scant attention has been paid so far to address the important issue if all the so called perfect gas models are atleast thermodynamically stable .",
    "otherwise they would lose the claim to be treated as a physically realistic system . following this",
    "there has been of late a resurgence of interests among workers to address their queries to this aspect of the problem . recently",
    "santos et al have studied the thermodynamical stability in generalised  @xcite and modified chaplygin  @xcite gas model on the basis of standard prescription  @xcite where both ( i ) @xmath10 , @xmath11 and ( ii ) @xmath12 are satisfied simultaneously .    in the present work we attempt to generalise their results to gou - zhang formalism as also to clarify the issues concerning thermodynamics of the chaplygin gas .",
    "we also investigate the nature of physical parameters such as pressure ( @xmath13 ) , effective equation of state ( @xmath14 ) , deceleration parameter ( @xmath15 ) etc . on the basis of thermodynamics .",
    "later many thermal quantities are derived as functions of temperature or volume . in this case",
    ", we also show as consistency check that the third law of thermodynamics is satisfied by the new form of the chaplygin gas .",
    "for the generalised chaplygin gas we expect to have almost similar behaviour as the chaplygin gas equations did show .",
    "further , we see that the chaplygin gas which shows a unified picture of dark matter and energy cools down through the adiabatic expansion of the universe without any critical point .",
    "returning to the stability criterion of the chaplygin gas we find a striking difference from the analysis of santos et al .",
    "in our case of variable modified chaplygin gas ( vmcg )  @xcite we find that the stability depends critically on the new parameter @xmath3 , as introduced by guo et al .",
    "we also notice that stability decreases with the increase of magnitude of @xmath3 , which apparently disfavors the formalism of guo - zhang  @xcite . in the section on acoustic velocity",
    "we interestingly note that unlike the previous chaplygin gas models where the squared sound velocity is always positive definite , the velocity here depends on the value of the newly introduced parameter @xmath3 .",
    "but as noted earlier the stability criteria dictates that @xmath3 should be negative which , however , makes the squared velocity also negative at the late stage of evolution .",
    "this means that the perfect fluid model for guo s variant of the chaplygin gas is classically unstable and is in line with the results obtained earlier by myung  @xcite while dealing with the holographic interpretation for chaplygin gas and tachyon .",
    "the paper ends with a short discussion .",
    "the line element corresponding to spatially flat frw spacetime is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the scale factor . in this work",
    "we consider the following equation of state    @xmath18    @xmath19 and @xmath7 are positive constants .",
    "as discussed in the introduction we have taken @xmath20 where @xmath3 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath2 an absolute constant . here",
    "@xmath13 corresponds to the pressure and @xmath21 the energy density of that fluid such that    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the internal energy and volume filled by the fluid respectively .",
    "we try to find out the energy density @xmath23 and pressure @xmath13 of variable modified chaplygin gas as a function of its entropy @xmath25 and volume @xmath24 . from general thermodynamics , one has the following relationship @xmath26 with the help of the above equations we get    @xmath27    which , on integration yields    @xmath28^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}.\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath29 is the integration constant , which may be a universal constant or a function of entropy @xmath25 only .",

    "for @xmath46 , let @xmath24 is denoted by @xmath47 , which is given by     [ fig : subfigureexample ]    @xmath48^{\\frac{1}{n}},\\ ] ]    which restricts @xmath3 as @xmath49 .",

    "this is an interesting result showing that @xmath47 introduces a new scale in the analysis , beyond which a dust dominated universe enters the acceleration era . with expansion",
    "an initially decelerating universe tends to reverse its motion and prepares to accelerate when its volume crosses a critical value designated by @xmath47 .",
    "it is also to be noted that for physically realistic values of constants both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are of the same order of magnitude i.e. @xmath55 also signifies a volume scale beyond which accelerating era commences .",

    "now using equation we get the expression of thermal heat capacity as    @xmath181^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha } } \\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau^{1+\\alpha } } \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha } } \\left(\\frac{v}{v^{1+\\alpha } } \\right)^{\\frac{a}{\\alpha } } } { \\alpha \\left \\{1-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau } \\right)^{\\frac{1+\\alpha}{\\alpha}}\\left(\\frac{v}{v } \\right)^{\\frac{a(1+\\alpha)}{\\alpha}}\\right \\}^{\\frac{2 + \\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}}~.\\ ] ]    since @xmath172 and @xmath104 , @xmath182 is always satisfied irrespective of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "this ensures the positivity of @xmath103 .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the temperature goes to zero @xmath183 goes to zero as expected from the third law of thermodynamics .    if we put @xmath124 and @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. _ variable chaplygin gas model , we get the identical expression of @xmath184 of our previous work  @xcite . again for @xmath124 and @xmath68 , the equation reduces to the work of santos et al  @xcite .    to end the section a final remark may be in order .",
    "while _ positivity _ of specific heat is strongly desirable _ vis - a - vis _ when dealing with special relativity , in a recent communication luongo _",
    "@xcite argued that in a frw type of model like the one we are discussing a negative specific heat at constant volume and a vanishingly small specific heat at constant pressure @xmath185 are compatible with observational data .",
    "in fact they have derived the most general cosmological model which is agreeable with the @xmath186 and @xmath187 values obtained for the specific heats of the universe and showed , in addition , that it also overcomes the fine - tuning and the coincidence problems of the @xmath70cdm model . + * ( f ) thermal eos : * + since @xmath188 , using , and we get the internal energy as a function of both @xmath24 and @xmath157 as follows :    @xmath189    now using , and the pressure is    @xmath190.\\ ] ]    we have seen from equation that for @xmath191 and @xmath60 , the solution reduces to our previous work  @xcite .",
    "it is to be seen that for @xmath124 and @xmath68 the above solution goes to an earlier work of santos et al @xcite .",
    "now the thermal eos parameter is given by    @xmath192    thus thermal eos parameter is , in general , a function of both temperature and volume . if we consider early stage of the universe when at very high temperature and small volume , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath177 and also @xmath178 , we get from equation that @xmath193 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath116 .",
    "this is same as equation .",
    "vs @xmath24 are shown .",
    "the graphs clearly show that @xmath194 throughout the evolution only for negative values of @xmath3 . here",
    "we have taken @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 . _",
    "[ 1 ] , width=302 ]    secondly we consider for large volume , _",
    "i.e. _ , very low temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath175 , we get from equation that @xmath200 , which is identical with equation as is customary with the existing literature in this field  @xcite .",
    "thus thermodynamical state represented by equations and are essentially same at both early and the late stage of the universe .",
    "now from equation we have to examine if @xmath201 , and a lengthy but straight forward calculation shows that only for negative value of @xmath3 , this condition satisfies .",
    "it is very difficult to find out @xmath202 from the equation in a compact form and to get requisite inferences from it .",
    "so we have taken recourse to graphical method instead . from fig - 6",
    ", we clearly infer that @xmath203 for @xmath71 throughout the evolution depending on the values of constants .    now to discuss the thermodynamic stability of the vmcg one should have @xmath203 and @xmath204 _ i.e. _ , both isothermal and adiabatic situations need to be addressed . in the process",
    "we have found that @xmath205 and @xmath202 are negative for @xmath5 .",
    "relevant to mention that in a previous work by santos et al  @xcite it was assumed @xmath206 for simplicity , but in our case we have not made such a simplistic approach .",
    "in fact we have used a different type of approach to find out the expression of @xmath207 . as we have not made this assumption",
    "our analysis is more general in nature and our formulations would not reduce to there case when @xmath68 .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section we here take up a standard relation of thermodynamics ( e.g. the first internal energy equation )  @xcite as a trial case to see if the equation is satisfied .",
    "@xmath208    using equations and we verify the relation which proves the correctness of our approach . + *",
    "( f ) pressure - volume relation : * + it is very difficult to arrive at a @xmath209 relation in a general way .",
    "so one has to take recourse to extremal conditions .",
    "\\1 . for small volume , @xmath114 , which gives @xmath210 . in this case energy density and also pressure",
    "are very high .",
    "using the temperature will be    @xmath211    at the early stage of the universe @xmath178 ( minimum volume ) implies that @xmath177 ( maximum temperature ) so the temperature is high enough at this stage .",
    "using equations and we get    @xmath212    therefore , @xmath213 we know at this stage that @xmath214 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath215 , which gives using equation @xmath216 .",
    "since the entropy remains constant in an adiabatic process , this relation leads to @xmath217 constant .",
    "so it is observed that for small volume , _",
    "i.e. _ , at high temperature the vmcg behaves as a fluid of @xmath218 .",
    "we can also rewrite the eos as @xmath219 . since",
    "early universe is radiation dominated _ i.e. _ , @xmath101 , the value of @xmath220 , the pressure is related to the volume as @xmath221 constant .",
    "thus the vmcg behaves like a photon gas .",
    "the equation of adiabatic photon gas coincides with extreme relativistic electron gas .",
    "\\2 . for large volume , @xmath222 ,    due to low density at this stage ,",
    "entropy density is sufficiently small at the low temperature .",
    "we know from equation that @xmath223 again , from equation , in this case we get    @xmath224    now using equations and , we get    @xmath225    equations , and can be obtained from the equations , and respectively at @xmath175 . for an adiabatic system , the above equation looks like @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is a constant . since we know that vmcg is thermodynamically stable for @xmath5 which leads to @xmath228 . in this case , @xmath13 is also negative . at the late stage of evolution ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , at low temperature , the vmcg behaves like a fluid of @xmath229 .",
    "interestingly , it is to be noted that the value of this @xmath230 depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath103 at this stage of evolution .",
    "it further follows from equation that @xmath175 for @xmath231 .",
    "since any system near @xmath179 is in states very close to its ground state , quantum mechanics is essential to the understanding of its properties .",
    "indeed , the degree of randomness at these low temperatures is so small that discrete quantum effects can be observed on a macroscopic scale .",
    "following the discovery of late acceleration of the universe there is a proliferation of varied dark energy models as its possible rescuers .",
    "while many of them significantly explain the observational findings coming out of different cosmic probes serious considerations have not been directed so far to the query whether the models are thermodynamically viable , for example if they obey the time honoured stability criteria .",
    "we have here considered a very general type of exotic fluid , termed ` variable modified chaplygin gas ' and studied its cosmological implications , mainly its thermodynamical stability . regarding the cosmological dynamics we have come across two characteristic volumes of the fluid - @xmath90 and @xmath91 representing critical volume and flip volume respectively .",
    "the former refers to the case where pressure changes its sign while the latter gives the volume when the acceleration flip occurs . from physical consideration one",
    "should get @xmath232 - which also matches with our analysis .",
    "as discussed at the end of section @xmath233 , for flip to occur in frw cosmology only a negative pressure is not the necessary and sufficient condition",
    ". the magnitude of pressure should be also less than @xmath92 , which also follows from our analysis . +",
    "although the exhaustive analysis of the latest cosmological observations provides a definite clue of the existence of dark energy in the universe but it is difficult to distinguish between the merits of various forms of dark energy at present . for the stability criteria we have followed the standard prescription : @xmath204 , @xmath203 and @xmath234",
    "this , however , dictates that the new parameter , @xmath3 introduced vmcg should be negative definite .",
    "this contrasts sharply with an earlier contention of lu s",
    "@xcite where to explain the observational results they have to choose @xmath3 as positive definite .",
    "this is pathological because it makes the system thermodynamically unstable .",
    "again this model shows that at early stage , the eos becomes @xmath235 , where @xmath236 .",
    "but at late stage , it reduces to equation . from the thermodynamical stability conditions",
    ", we find that @xmath126 , which favours a phantom like evolution and big rip is thus unavoidable .",
    "so far as phantom model is concerned , it is found to be compatible with sne ia observations and cmb anisotropy measurements  @xcite .",
    "the most important conclusion coming out of our analysis is that this model covers both big bang and big rip in the whole evolution process .",
    "it is to be noted that at @xmath179 the entropy of vmcg vanishes as in conformity with the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "we have studied both the thermal and the caloric eos which shows that both @xmath237 and @xmath238 where @xmath167 is a maximum temperature and @xmath168 is a minimum volume attainable .",
    "here @xmath167 and @xmath168 are canonical in the sense that as @xmath177 , @xmath178 at the early stage , _ i.e. _ , @xmath239 represents the maximum temperature that our vmcg model can sustain for the small finite volume , @xmath168 .",
    "we have also discussed @xmath240 relation and at early stage ( @xmath101 ) it is shown that for an isentropic system vmcg behaves like a photon gas , as it was at the time of radiation dominated era . it is also shown that for large volume , _",
    "i.e. _ , at low temperature , entropy is sufficiently low which agrees well with the currently available low energy density of the universe",
    ".    finally it may not be out of place to point out that as the field equations are very involved in nature we have to adopt an _",
    "ansatz _ to determine the function of integration @xmath207 .",
    "however to justify it we have checked an important relation ( first internal energy equation ) and have found it to be correct .",
    "so our _ ansatz _ is essentially viable .",
    "moreover , this model is very general in the sense that many of earlier works in this field may be obtained as a special case .    to end a final remark may be in order .",
    "we have here concentrated on the cosmological and thermodynamical behaviour of the vmcg model mainly on a theoretical premise . however , as a future exercise one should try to constrain the value of the parameters associated with both thermal and caloric eos in the light of observational values .    * acknowledgment :* one of us(sc ) acknowledges the financial support of ugc , new delhi for a mrp award and acknowledges cern for a short visit .",
