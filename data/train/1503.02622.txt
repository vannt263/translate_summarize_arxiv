    ", therefore , seems to be up to experiments  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the mass regime where such experiments become feasible is not that far from what is currently possible in the laboratory .",
    "this is because eq .",
    "yields a nonlinear newtonian gravitational self - interaction in the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "such a nonlinearity has observable consequences , despite the weakness of the gravitational interaction .",
    "these self - gravitational effects were first modelled by the _",
    "one - particle _ schrdinger - newton equation  @xcite , @xmath1 the self - gravitational interaction represented by the nonlinear term predicts inhibitions of the free spreading of a wave - function for masses of about @xmath2 and beyond  @xcite .",
    "experiments aiming at testing this behaviour could be realistic , at least in space , where a free spreading over longer time scales is feasible .    evidently , the massive systems needed for such an experiment can not be elementary particles . rather will they consist of a large number of constituents .",
    "one may , therefore , ask in what sense eq .",
    "describes such a many - body system .",
    "the many - body dynamics following from the hypothesis of a fundamentally semi - classical gravity   will be discussed in some detail in section  [ sec : manypart ] .",

    "approximately describes the centre of mass of a complex system , provided that its centre of mass is sufficiently de - localised in order to be allowed to disregard its internal structure .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the centre - of - mass wave - function is narrow compared to the size of the system , the resulting self - gravitational potential is a function of the first and second moments , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and quadratic in @xmath5 . a potential of this form will leave the shape of a gaussian wave - function intact during its evolution .",
    "contrary to eq .",
    ", where for a numerical analysis the full wave - function must be simulated , the centre - of - mass dynamics can then be described by the evolution of the wave - function width as a single parameter .",

    "al  @xcite make use of this , proposing to approximate the schrdinger - newton equation by a quadratic potential also in the case where the full dynamics are given by eq .  .",
    "their approximation is valid for weak gravitational potentials and substantially simplifies numerical calculations .",
    "it has been employed in order to provide a crucial contribution towards an experimental test by comparing the self - gravitational inhibitions of dispersion to other decoherence sources .",
    "the wave - function dependent quadratic potential they use was , however , inferred from a comparison of energies , rather than derived directly from the schrdinger - newton equation . here ,",
    "after reviewing the many - body and centre of mass equations in section  [ sec : manypart ] , we will provide such a direct derivation in section  [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "the result will be compared with the approximation used by colin et  al .",
    "@xcite in section  [ sec : comparison ] , where we find some deviations .",
    "we will conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "in a condensate of many constituents which collectively occupy the same state , eq .   appears as a hartree approximation and can be derived in a similar fashion as the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite ; it is then , for example , a model for the self - gravitation of bosonic stars  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "its origin is the _ mutual _ newtonian interaction of the constituents and it provides an effective description of the factors of a tensor product state of the condensate , regardless whether eq .",
    "is fundamentally correct or not .",
    "this is _ not _ the point of view taken here .    on the other hand , if one starts with eq .",
    "as a hypothesis about the gravitational interaction of quantum matter , applies it to a klein - gordon or dirac field , takes the nonrelativistic limit , and restricts oneself to the one - particle sector then eq",
    ".   follows immediately as the _ fundamental _ dynamical equation for a _ single _ , nonrelativistic quantum particle  @xcite . since in the nonrelativistic limit",
    "there is no interaction between the sectors of different particle number , one can choose a restriction to the @xmath6-particle sector instead , for arbitrary @xmath6 .",

    "however , the dependence on the latter is only a dependence on the ratio @xmath49 for the functions @xmath33 and @xmath50 , while @xmath32 is a function of mass density only . for a given mass density , if units are chosen such that @xmath45 , the only true dependence on mass comes through the initial condition  .",
    "while for a precise numerical analysis of the equations   and   the full wave - function must be simulated on a grid of many points , for this approximation it is sufficient to determine the evolution of @xmath51 .",
    "this significantly simplifies numerical estimations of the magnitude of effects , and may even allow for some analytical results which can not be seen from the full equation .",
    "equation   also follows , if one starts with a harmonic oscillator ansatz with width dependent coupling , @xmath52 the authors of  @xcite employ an energy argument in order to determine an approximation for @xmath53 . to follow this argument , first note that equation   possesses the conserved energy @xmath54 if the potential @xmath55 satisfies @xmath56 for the standard harmonic oscillator potential , where @xmath57 is a constant , @xmath55 is simply the potential energy of the oscillator",
    "the potential @xmath55 is then chosen such that @xmath58 , with @xmath59 defined in eq .  , which leads to the functions    [ eqn : f - g - colin]@xmath60    rather than @xmath61 and @xmath62 in equations   and  .",
    "intuitively speaking , the mesoscopic particle moves in a time - dependent harmonic potential , whose coupling constant is tuned in such a way that the potential energy of the particle in the trap matches the gravitational potential energy between two particles , one sitting at the centre of the harmonic potential and the other one sitting at @xmath63 .    from this intuitive picture",
    "it is already evident what could go wrong with such an approximation , if applied to the self - gravitational potential in the schrdinger - newton equation . for the case of a narrow wave - function ,",
    "the gravitational potential within the mesoscopic particle is , in fact , a harmonic potential , as is also indicated by the approximation  .",
    "however , in the wide wave - function case , where the mass density is well approximated by a delta distribution , the gravitational potential for a gaussian wave - function with @xmath64 is @xmath65 while this can be approximated by a quadratic function for small @xmath66 , one obtains @xmath67 for large @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , for the full schrdinger - newton equation the part of the wave - function at positions @xmath68 will not see a quadratic potential , not even as an approximation , but a coulomb - like potential .",
    "hence , from the evolution according to the full schrdinger - newton equation one expects a weaker response to gravity than the approximation by a harmonic potential according to equations   and   suggests .    in fig .",

    "there is a clear deviation in the intermediate regime , where @xmath70 . for wide wave - functions ,",
    "the deviation decreases in magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , the functions also differ in their limiting behaviour for @xmath71 . while @xmath61 approaches zero like @xmath72 , @xmath69 falls off like @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig : plot - solution ] shows how this can lead to a qualitatively different behaviour in the equations of motion .",
    "the plotted solution corresponds to an osmium sphere of about diameter . for a wide wave - function",
    "both solutions show at least a similar tendency to slightly decrease in width and oscillate , even though with a significantly lower frequency for the approximation with @xmath61 , @xmath62 compared to @xmath69 , @xmath74 . in the intermediate regime , on the other hand , the solution according to eqs .",
    "spreads only a little slower than the free solution , while the solution according to eqs .   and",
    "is bound close to its initial width .",
    "one can use the equation   for the initial acceleration , in order to define a critical mass ( by the condition @xmath75 ) which can serve as a rough estimate of whether the initial state will decrease or increase in width upon free evolution .",
    "comparison of the functions @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath74 then shows that , for wider wave - functions with @xmath76 , the approximation chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite underestimates this mass value by an approximate 20% .",
    "we have shown how , under the assumption of a weak self - gravitational effect that leaves the shape of an initially gaussian wave packet intact , the free quantum evolution according to the schrdinger - newton equation can be approximated by a single parameter differential equation for the square of the wave - function width , @xmath4 .",
    "the comparison with the previous approximation scheme used by colin et  al .",
    "@xcite for the very same purpose revealed deviations for wider wave - functions .",
    "while their results made use of an approximation of the gravitational potential by a quasi - harmonic interaction , which was determined by a rather ad hoc energy argument , here we provided a systematic derivation , based on the aforementioned approximation .",
    "for the purpose of ref .",
    "@xcite , where self - gravitating effects were compared to decoherence sources , both approximation schemes can serve as sufficiently good order of magnitude estimates .",
    "the behaviour in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot - solution]b shows , however , that large deviations from the real evolution according to the full equation are possible .",
