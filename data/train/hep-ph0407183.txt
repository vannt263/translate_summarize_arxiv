    "we point out that contrary to the general expectations , the atmospheric neutrino flux does not dominate over the astrophysical neutrino flux for the neutrino energy @xmath14 gev , once the flavor composition of the neutrino flux is taken into account .",

    "the comparison of the galactic - plane and the downward going atmospheric @xmath5 flux is given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : down ] in the presence of neutrino oscillations ( we plot @xmath113 instead of @xmath114 ) .",
    "the former flux clearly dominates the latter for @xmath115 gev , whereas the two fluxes cross at @xmath116 gev for @xmath117 ev@xmath118 and @xmath9 .",
    "this comparison is however subject to the uncertainty of galactic - plane @xmath5 flux by the choices of the density @xmath119 and the distance @xmath24 mentioned before .",
    "one can see that the atmospheric @xmath5 flux is sensitive to the value of @xmath120 for @xmath121 gev .",
    "furthermore , a change of slope occurs for the atmospheric @xmath5 flux at @xmath122 gev . beyond this    energy , the slope of the atmospheric @xmath5 flux",
    "is identical to that of the galactic - plane @xmath5 flux . for @xmath123 gev ,",
    "the atmospheric @xmath5 flux is intrinsic , i.e. , coming from the @xmath40 decays , whereas the galactic - plane @xmath5 flux arises from the oscillation of the @xmath13 , which is produced mainly by the @xmath36 decays . in both cases , the hadrons decay before interacting with the medium .",
    "such a feature dictates the slope of the outgoing neutrino flux .",
    "below 20 gev , however , the atmospheric @xmath5 flux predominantly comes from the @xmath13 oscillations , i.e. , @xmath124 following eq .",
    "( [ osc ] ) . since @xmath125 km for @xmath126 gev with @xmath117 ev@xmath118 , we approximate @xmath127 with @xmath128 so that @xmath129 .",
    "because the neutrino oscillation effect steepens the @xmath130 spectrum for @xmath121 gev , the slope change of @xmath130 at @xmath131 gev is significant .",
    "we have also worked out the comparison of the galactic - plane and the atmospheric @xmath5 fluxes for several other zenith angles .",
    "for instance , the crossing of the galactic - plane and the atmospheric @xmath5 fluxes occurs at @xmath132 gev for the zenith angle @xmath133 for @xmath117 ev@xmath118 with the maximal mixing .",
    "essentially , the atmospheric @xmath5 flux increases with the zenith angle @xmath53 while the galactic - plane @xmath5 flux stays unchanged .",
    "moreover , from the phenomenological point of view , a larger @xmath53 only implies a larger atmospheric tau neutrino background while our focus is on the prospective observation of the astrophysical tau neutrinos .",
    "two key factors determine the angular behavior of the former flux .",
    "first , the atmosphere depth is larger for @xmath133 compared to the downward direction .",
    "second , the atmospheric muon neutrinos are produced more far away from the ground detector in this angle , implying a larger @xmath2 oscillation probability . we have found that , for @xmath134 gev , the downward going muon neutrinos are produced on average about @xmath135 km from the ground detector . at @xmath133 , the above distance increases to @xmath136 km . in the angular range @xmath137 , the curvature of the earth can be neglected and the angular dependence of the neutrino flux can be easily calculated @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:60deg ] , we show the comparison for the zenith angle @xmath138 ( vertically upward going direction ) . for @xmath117",
    "ev@xmath118 with the maximal mixing the crossing between the two fluxes cross at 800 gev .",
    "the oscillatory behavior in the total atmospheric tau neutrino flux is a manifestation of the narrow zenith angle dependence .",
    "we have so far neglected the 3-body muon decay contribution to the atmospheric @xmath13 flux . as mentioned earlier , this contribution is relevant only for 1 gev @xmath139 10 gev .",
    "the ratio of this contribution to the total atmospheric @xmath13 flux is available in the literature @xcite . for @xmath140 , @xmath126 gev ,",
    "the ratio is about @xmath141 .",
    "it drops to @xmath142 at @xmath134 gev for the same @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "this ratio is not very sensitive to the zenith angle @xmath53 .",
    "the error due to neglecting this contribution propagates to the determination of the atmospheric @xmath5 flux by the neutrino oscillation effect .",
    "numerically , this error is comparable to the uncertainty of the @xmath5 flux due to the uncertainty of the @xmath143 , as @xmath144 .",
    "the results presented in figs .  [ fig : down ] , [ fig:60deg ] and [ fig : mt ] indicate the opportunities for the tau neutrino astronomy in the gev energies for the incident zenith angles @xmath145 in the two neutrino flavor mixing approximation .",
    "the galactic - plane tau neutrino flux dominates over the atmospheric tau neutrino background until a few gev s .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath146 gev , the former flux has a rather different slope from that of the latter .",
    "this is an important criterion for distinguishing the two fluxes , particularly given that the normalization of the galactic - plane tau neutrino flux is still uncertain .",
    "we have pointed out that the dominance of the galactic - plane tau neutrino flux over its atmospheric background in gev energies is unique among all the considered neutrino flavors .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt ] . because of the @xmath147 neutrino oscillations , the total galactic @xmath5 flux is identical to that of the galactic @xmath13 flux .",
    "however , the atmospheric @xmath13 flux is much larger than the atmospheric @xmath5 flux . as a result , in the presence of neutrino oscillations ,",
    "the crossing energy value for the galactic - plane and the atmospheric @xmath13 fluxes is pushed up to @xmath148 gev , which is drastically different from the tau neutrino case .",
    "we have estimated the galactic - plane tau neutrino induced shower event rate @xmath149 for the forthcoming one mega ton class of detectors .",
    "it is obtained by convolving the total galactic - plane tau neutrino flux shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt ] with the charged - current @xmath150 interaction cross section ( using the cteq6 parton distribution functions @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that the @xmath149 can be 4.5 ( 7.5 ) for @xmath151 10 gev with a data taking period of 3 ( 5 ) years .",
    "a remark concerning the possible background induced by the electron neutrino events and the neutral current events to the prospective observation of tau neutrino events is in order .",
    "below @xmath152 gev , the tau lepton decay length is less than a mm .",
    "this tau lepton is produced in the detector in the galactic - plane tau neutrino induced interactions .",
    "there are certain specific signatures of the tau neutrino induced tau leptons such as the appearance of the kink at the tau lepton decay ( absent for the electrons ) @xcite , as well as the relative characteristic fractional energy sharing from the incident neutrino @xcite . a large scale finely grained detector with a resolution of a few @xmath153 m",
    "will thus be required to disentangle the galactic - plane tau neutrino induced events from the events induced by the electron neutrinos and the neutral current events on the event - by - event basis .",
