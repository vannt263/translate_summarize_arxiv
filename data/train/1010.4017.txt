    "the numerical flow analysis ( nfa ) code provides turnkey capabilities to model breaking waves around a ship , including both plunging and spilling breaking waves , the formation of spray , and the entrainment of air . a description of nfa and its current capabilities can be found in dommermuth et al .",

    "nfa solves the navier - stokes equations utilizing a cartesian - grid formulation .",
    "the flow in the air and water is modeled , and as a result , nfa can directly model air entrainment and the generation of droplets .",
    "the interface capturing of the free surface uses a second - order accurate , volume - of - fluid technique .",
    "a cut - cell method is used to enforce no - flux boundary conditions on the hull .",
    "a boundary - layer model has been developed ( rottman et al . 2010 ) , but it is not used in these numerical simulations , and as a result , the tangential velocities are free to slip over the hull .",
    "nfa uses an implicit sub - grid scale ( sgs ) model that is built into the treatment of the convective terms in the momentum equations ( brucker et al .",
    "a surface representation of the ship hull is all that is required as input in terms of hull geometry .",
    "the numerical scheme is implemented in a distributed memory parallel computing environment using fortran 90 and the message passing interface ii ( mpi2 ) .",
    "relative to methods that use a body - fitted grid , the potential advantages of nfa s approach are significantly simplified griding requirements and greatly improved numerical stability due to the highly structured grid .",

    "a plane of symmetry is not used on the centerline of the hull because small - scale turbulent structures are adversely affected .",

    "the data sets are so large that only time steps 20,0000 through 30,000 are saved every 40 time steps for the purposes of post processing .",
    "the 1.06 billion cell simulation takes about 90 hours of wall - clock time to run 30,000 time steps using 1008 processors .",
    "the wall - clock time can be cut in half by doubling the number of processors because nfa scales linearly .",
    "alternatively , increasing the number of processors to 10,000 - 20,000 will enable numerical simulations of breaking ship waves and tsunamis with 25 - 50 billion grid cells within the next year .",
