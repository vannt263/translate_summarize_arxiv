    "<S> @xmath66 up to first order in @xmath67 . </S>",

    "<S> in order to determine the new eigenvalues and eigenstates of the perturbed hamiltonian , one needs calculate the matrix elements of @xmath75 in the basis of 2d hydrogenic levels . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the effect of @xmath71 on @xmath76 and @xmath77 states which are degenerate in 2d hydrogen atom . due to the symmetry of @xmath74 under the exchange of @xmath5 and @xmath78 , </S>",

    "<S> the above scenario is an analog of orbital zeeman effect where degeneracy of @xmath83 states of a hydrogen atom is lifted in the presence of a constant magnetic field due to coupling to angular momentum @xmath84 , an antisymmetric quantity . </S>",

    "<S> , the degeneracy of all @xmath0 states of 2d hydrogen atom will be lifted due to berry curvature as in the case of orbital zeeman effect . </S>",
    "<S> due to the appearance of valley index @xmath85 in @xmath74 , the splitting is opposite in the two valleys as required by time - reversal symmetry . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ infinitesimalgeneral ] ) , we can conclude that when berry curvature is small but not constant , it is the berry flux through the exciton wave function which determines the splitting . </S>",

    "<S> , only the symmetric part @xmath79 survives due to symmetry reasons , leading to a blue - shift in energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the shift of @xmath98 states is @xmath99 , making it almost degenerate with @xmath100 state under our assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : gappedgraphene ] , shows a schematic energy - level diagram of the model with and without the bloch perturbation . upon setting the bloch overlap to be unity , we find that the @xmath83 states remain degenerate resembling unmixed @xmath76 and @xmath77 orbitals thereby confirming the role of bloch overlap in splitting .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also consider a two - band model with identically zero berry curvature to confirm that the mixing of @xmath76 and @xmath77 states stems from berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath101 is the hamiltonian in pauli matrix basis , then choosing @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 gives vanishing berry curvature as it is proportional to @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in numerical calculations we find that the @xmath83 wave functions for such a model remain unmixed .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we comment on the role of qgt in determining the exciton spectra . </S>",
    "<S> qgt can be rewritten as - @xmath106 - \\langle \\partial_{k_i}u | u \\rangle \\langle u |\\partial_{k_j }   u \\rangle \\\\   & = & \\langle x_i x_j \\rangle - \\langle x_i \\rangle \\langle x_j \\rangle , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , the operator @xmath107 is the generator of translation in the @xmath5-space . </S>",
    "<S> qgt then measures the quantum fluctuations of @xmath107  @xcite . in the present case , @xmath107 corresponds to a spread in  relative position \" of electron and hole . </S>",
    "<S> this is not unlike the case of lamb - shift in hydrogen atom where vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field smear electron s position , in turn changing its potential energy and resulting in a measurable shift of its energy  @xcite . in other words , qgt can be thought of as  vacuum fluctuations \" of the effective @xmath48 gauge field present in the @xmath5-space , and the corresponding shifts as an analog of the lamb shift . </S>",
    "<S> even when berry curvature vanishes identically , the effect of qgt must still remain . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the magnitude of this lamb - like shift can be relatively large compared to the hydrogenic lamb shift ; this observation can be thought of as a consequence of the fact that the effective fine structure constant of the gapped graphene model , @xmath108 = @xmath109 is on the the order of unity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we identify another physically relevant consequence of qgt which has been previously shown to be behind such varied phenomena as electric polarization in insulators  @xcite , current noise  @xcite , and even quantum phase transitions  @xcite    ) and large exciton bohr - radius . in absence of bloch term in the numerical calculations , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath110 = 2 states remain degenerate like hydrogen atom . upon the inclusion of bloch term , 2@xmath8 states mix and split due to @xmath86 much like the orbital zeeman effect . </S>",

    "<S> [ [ tmd - excitons ] ] tmd excitons + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the following , we investigate how the predictions of the preceding discussion apply to tmd excitons . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that the experimentally observed deviation from a hydrogenic series arises due to a combination of non - local dielectric screening , non - parabolic dispersion of bands , and the effect of the bloch part . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of constant and small berry curvature no longer holds due to the large spread of exciton wave function in @xmath5-space . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , unlike other material system such as gaas where the lowest energy exciton is made from electron - hole states near the @xmath6-point ( @xmath5= 0 ) , lowest energy excitons in tmds are made from @xmath57-point electron - hole pairs where there is non - zero berry curvature . </S>",
