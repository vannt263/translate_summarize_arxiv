    "the transition from a quark - gluon plasma to a hadron gas in the early universe took place at a temperature @xmath1 mev .",
    "recent results of lattice qcd indicate a first - order phase transition for the physical values of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 quark masses @xcite .",
    "the mass inside the hubble horizon at the qcd transition is @xmath5 .",
    "crawford and schramm @xcite first proposed that black hole formation at the qcd transition could account for dark matter today .",
    "recently jedamzik @xcite proposed to identify such primordial black holes ( pbh ) with the macho s ( massive compact halo objects ) observed by microlensing @xcite .",
    "he pointed out that the formation of pbh s should be particularly efficient during the qcd transition due to a significant decrease in the effective sound speed during the transition .",
    "schmid , schwarz and widerin @xcite showed that during a first - order qcd transition the sound velocity @xmath6 vanishes ( for wavelengths much larger than the bubble separation ) , there are no pressure gradients , no restoring forces , and preexisting cosmological density perturbations go into free fall .",
    "they computed the amplification of linear cosmological perturbations due to the qcd transition .",
    "the amplification is very large for scales @xmath7 far below the horizon , amplification @xmath8 with @xmath9 in the bag model , @xmath10 in a fit to lattice qcd data .",
    "there is no amplification for superhorizon modes in accordance with a general theorem . near the horizon the first peak ( above the incoming spectrum of cosmological perturbations ) has a height ( amplification factor ) of only 1.5 for the fit to the lattice qcd data and 2.0 for the bag model .",
    "the position of the first peak is at @xmath11 , which corresponds to @xmath12 at the end of the first order qcd transition .",
    "it was concluded that primordial black hole formation is unlikely , because the amplifications of perturbations due to the qcd transition are large only far below the hubble scale .    in this paper",
    "we ask , whether a violent process like sudden reheating after supercooling at the beginning of the qcd transition could enhance the amplification of preexisting density perturbations and improve the possibility of black hole formation at the qcd transition .",
    "the amount of supercooling @xmath13 is proportional to the dimensionless ratio @xmath14 , where @xmath15 surface tension , @xmath16 latent heat , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "data are available only for quenched lattice qcd ( gluons only , no quarks ) @xcite : @xmath17 and a very small surface tension @xmath18 .",
    "this gives a very small supercooling of @xmath19 @xcite . in view of the uncertainties in the lattice qcd determinations and the absence of data for @xmath20 and @xmath21 from qcd including three physical quarks we consider the possibility of a larger surface tension and/or a smaller latent heat giving more supercooling .",
    "for illustrative purposes in our figures we used @xmath22 .",
    "the amplification of perturbations due to sudden reheating at the beginning of a first order qcd transition occurs because reheating happens at a certain supercooling temperature @xmath23 .",
    "hence underdensities reheat earlier than overdensities .",
    "( for subhorizon scales newtonian time is applicable . ) during this short period of time , there are spatial variations of pressure of @xmath24 leading to huge pressure gradients ( compared to the the small preexisting cosmological pressure gradients ) and huge fluid accelerations , hence preexisting overdensities get a very violent but very short compressional impulse .",
    "the fluid velocity effectively jumps proportional to the wave number @xmath25 . for scales far below the hubble radius",
    "this jump becomes the dominant contribution to the fluid velocity throughout the transition . in the bag model @xcite , which we shall consider here for simplicity , the resulting amplification of density perturbations for scales far below the horizon grows as @xmath26 , i.e. with one additional enhancement factor @xmath27 due to sudden reheating . for horizon and superhorizon",
    "scales general relativity must be used .",
    "the general relativistic time - evolution requires the choice of a foliation of space - time , and for linear perturbations this defines a gauge .",
    "the hypersurface of sudden reheating is a slice of constant energy density , and we use the corresponding gauge , the uniform density ( ud ) gauge , to evolve through sudden reheating . in this gauge",
    "the relevant variables are continuous at sudden reheating .",
    "to evolve before and after reheating the ud gauge is not suitable , because it is singular in the subhorizon limit , instead we use the uniform expansion ( ue ) gauge , which is nonsingular , and which is defined by requiring that the fundamental observers , who are at rest on a slice , have a uniform hubble expansion . in the ue gauge",
    "the relevant variables are discontinuous at sudden reheating , and these discontinuities are obtained in a very simple way by using the gauge transformation between the ud and the ue gauges . in the superhorizon limit the state variables in ue gauge do not jump .",
    "moreover we prove the theorem that phase transitions do not affect at all the laws of evolution for @xmath28 of the growing mode ( i.e. growing in relative importance ) in ue gauge in the limit @xmath29 , @xmath30 this translates into the conservation law @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , by using the energy constraint .",
    "because of this theorem the superhorizon modes during the qcd transition remain unaffected in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) . near the horizon",
    "the first amplification peak gives a factor @xmath33 for a supercooling of @xmath34 in the bag model , the additional enhancement due to sudden reheating at the horizon scale is about @xmath34 .",
    "the enhancement of black hole formation at the qcd transition is discussed in the last section . for standard models of structure formation without a large tilt , the amplitudes are not big enough to produce a cosmologically relevant amount of black holes @xcite . a tilted spectrum could be fine tuned to produce black holes at the qcd scale .",
    "but this tilted spectrum would need a break just below the qcd scale in order not to overproduce smaller black holes , a second fine - tuning .",
    "we conclude that the qcd transition enhances the probability of black hole formation , but for an observable amount of black holes today the preexisting spectrum would have to be fine tuned around the qcd scale , and the major effect would not be due to the qcd transition .",
    "the quark - gluon plasma , photons and leptons are tightly coupled via strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions , @xmath35 , and make up a single perfect ( i.e. dissipationless ) radiation fluid at scales @xmath36 , see @xcite .",
    "the pressure for perfect fluids with negligible chemical potential only depends on temperature . in the bag model @xcite , which we will consider for simplicity ,",
    "the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is described by @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective number of relativistic helicity states , and @xmath40 is the bag constant . above the phase transition temperature",
    "we include @xmath2 , @xmath3 quarks and gluons in the quark - gluon plasma and @xmath41 in the photon - lepton fluid .",
    "below the phase transition we model the radiation fluid as a hadron gas ( hg ) of massless pions , tightly coupled to the photons and leptons .    in the cosmological expansion the temperature in the bag model drops @xmath42 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . to derive this result we use @xmath43 , which comes from the maxwell relation for the free energy , hence @xmath44 .",
    "we further use that the entropy in a comoving volume is conserved , @xmath45 , and finally obtain @xmath46 .",
    "the energy density is given by @xmath47 from the first law and homogeneity , hence @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that the sound velocity @xmath49 and that @xmath50 .",
    "the bag constant is determined by the transition temperature @xmath51 and @xmath52 via @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "similarly the latent heat is given via @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "for supercooling , @xmath57 , the free energy density @xmath58 for the qgp is higher than for the hg , and therefore the qgp is not the equilibrium state .",
    "however the fluid supercools in the metastable quark - gluon phase until the formation and growth of hadronic bubbles starts reheating the universe at @xmath59 .",
    "we give a short overview of bubble nucleation and sudden reheating , a more detailed discussion of bubble nucleation can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "assuming homogeneous bubble nucleation ( no dirt ) the probability to form a bubble is proportional to @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the change in entropy by creating a bubble .",
    "@xmath61 is determined by the work required to form a ( spherical ) bubble , @xmath62 , where @xmath21 is the surface tension of a hadronic bubble . only for large enough bubbles ( @xmath63 )",
    "free energy is gained . the probability to form a hadronic bubble with critical radius per unit volume and unit time",

    "for small supercooling , @xmath66 , we obtain @xmath67 , where @xmath20 is the latent heat .",
    "therefore the probability to form a critical bubble per unit volume and unit time can be written as @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "a numerical prefactor to @xmath70 would be irrelevant for our purposes .",
    "the surface tension @xmath21 and the latent heat @xmath20 are the crucial parameters for @xmath23 .",
    "data are available only for quenched lattice qcd ( gluons only , no quarks ) @xcite : @xmath17 and a very small surface tension @xmath18",
    ". there are no values for unquenched qcd available yet . using the results from quenched lattice qcd we find @xmath71 .",
    "the bubbles grow most probably by weak deflagration @xcite , and the latent heat released from the bubbles is distributed into the surrounding qgp by acoustic waves and by neutrinos , whose mean free path is @xmath72 , of the order of the bubble separation .",
    "this reheats the qgp to @xmath51 and prohibits further bubble formation .",
    "the supercooling temperature fraction @xmath73 can be estimated by the schematic case of one single bubble nucleated per hubble volume and per hubble time , @xmath74^{1/2 } \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-4 }   \\vspace{2cm}.\\ ] ] this rough estimate gives a final supercooling fraction which is only @xmath75 too low compared to the more realistic case of one bubble nucleated per @xmath76 per @xmath77 of a hubble time , see @xcite . the time needed for the supercooling",
    "is given by @xmath78 .",
    "in the figures we took @xmath79 for illustrative purposes . at the maximal supercooling the universe suddenly reheats up to the qcd transition temperature @xmath51 .",

    "@xmath81 \\over\\rho+p } = \\eta,\\ ] ] up to linear order in @xmath73 .",
    "this jump in pressure depends on the maximal supercooling and can be a huge effect . in the case of the cosmological qcd transition it is @xmath82 times larger than preexisting cobe normalized perturbations . on the other hand ,",
    "the jump in entropy density is small since it has to be quadratic in @xmath73 due to the second law , @xmath83/s = \\frac32 \\eta^2 $ ] .",
    "the reheating is treated as a sudden process happening at the maximal supercooling , see fig .",
    "this is justified since the reheating time is @xmath84 , which follows from the following consideration .",
    "bubbles present at a given time have been nucleated typically during the preceding time interval @xmath85 .",
    "using the relation between time and supercooling @xmath73 , @xmath86 , we find @xmath87 the corresponding bubble nucleation distance is a few cm @xcite .    during the reversible part of the first order phase transition thermal equilibrium between the quark - gluon plasma and the hadron gas",
    "is maintained .",
    "we showed in @xcite that pressure gradients and the isentropic sound speed ( for wavelengths @xmath7 much larger than the bubble separation ) , @xmath88 , must be zero during a first - order phase transition of a fluid with negligible chemical potential ( i.e. no relevant conserved quantum number ) .",
    "the sound speed must be zero , because for such a fluid the pressure can only depend on the temperature , @xmath89 , and because the transition temperature @xmath90 has a given value , it can not depend on any parameter , hence @xmath91 is a given constant , and @xmath92 . during",
    "the entire qcd transition the sound speed stays zero and suddenly rises back to the radiation value @xmath93 after the transition is completed .",
    "in contrast pressure varies continuously and goes below the ideal radiation fluid value @xmath94 , but stays positive .",
    "the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations is first analyzed on subhorizon scales , where newtonian concepts for space and time ( for an expanding radiation fluid ) are applicable .",
    "the perturbations on subhorizon scales get an amplification factor which is quadratic in wave number @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "the maximal supercooling is reached when bubble nucleation becomes efficient and the radiation fluid suddenly reheats , i.e. it happens on a hypersurface of constant temperature , @xmath97 , hence uniform energy density . on this hypersurface of locally sudden reheating , @xmath98 ,",
    "pressure jumps uniformly , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    at a given newtonian time , overdensities have higher temperature than underdensities and therefore reheat later . this time delay ( lapse of time ) of the actual reheating of a fluid element on @xmath98 from the average newtonian time of reheating , @xmath99 ,",
    "is denoted by @xmath100 and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for an overdensity of one perturbation mode @xmath25 .",

    "the matching conditions are much more complicated in zero shear gauge than in uniform expansion gauge ; no superhorizon discontinuities in ue state variables , complicated discontinuity conditions in zs in ref .",
    "this is connected to the fact that the zero shear gauge is singular in the superhorizon limit ( bardeen 1988 @xcite ) , and one particular aspect of this is that @xmath228 in the superhorizon limit .    finally we show that the uniform density gauge is singular in the subhorizon limit . for a harrison - zeldovich spectrum",
    "the subhorizon density contrast @xmath229 is independent of @xmath25 , the state variables @xmath230 agree with @xmath231 in a jeans analysis . from eq .",
    "( [ timedelay ] ) and the subhorizon limit of eq .",
    "( [ kud ] ) we obtain @xmath232 .",

    "black holes form in a radiation dominated universe if the density contrast of a top hat perturbation inside the hubble radius is in the range @xmath234 @xcite . for an observable amount of @xmath235 black holes today ,",
    "i.e. @xmath236 , the fraction @xmath237 of energy density converted to black holes at the qcd transition must be @xmath238 . for a gaussian distribution of density fluctuations the fraction @xmath237 of @xmath239 at the time of formation",
    "is given by , @xmath240 without any enhancement from the qcd transition this requires @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "the sudden reheating at the onset of a first - order qcd transition leads to huge amplifications of density perturbations on scales far below the hubble horizon .",
    "but at the horizon scale the qcd transition gives enhancement factors of @xmath242 and @xmath33 for the bag model without resp . with sudden reheating for a supercooling of @xmath34 , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , an additional enhancement of @xmath243 . for lattice",
    "qcd without sudden reheating the enhancement factor is @xmath244 @xcite in our linear perturbation treatment .",
    "this indicates a corresponding reduction in the required preexisting perturbation spectrum at the solar mass scale .",
    "cardall and fuller @xcite used a qualitative argument of carr and hawking @xcite and the bag model and also obtained a factor @xmath245 reduction in the required preexisting perturbation spectrum .",
    "these qcd factors of @xmath244 or @xmath246 are so modest that a preexisting harrison - zeldovich spectrum with cobe normalization is very far from giving a cosmologically relevant amount of black holes @xcite .",
    "one would have to put in a fine - tuned tilt @xmath247 to get the desired amount of black holes .",
    "however , this tilted spectrum would overproduce primordial black holes on scales which are only a factor @xmath248 below the hubble radius at the transition . therefore a break in the preexisting spectrum below the qcd scale would be required , a second fine tuning .",
    "we conclude that the qcd transition with or without sudden reheating enhances the probability of black hole formation , but the preexisting spectrum needs to be fine tuned around the qcd scale , and the major effect would not be due to the qcd transition .",
