    "the rattleback , the elongated asymmetric semi - ellipsoidal top , has amused and bemused scientists and in fact people of all walks of life since ancient times .",
    "however , the chirality of this toy , the breaking of mirror symmetry as manifested by rotational preference , points to a serious physical effect that may occur in complicated dynamical systems that describe matter . in order to investigate the essence of this chirality",
    ", one can begin with rigid - body equations of motion for the rattleback , which are reminiscent of the partial differential equation that describes the @xmath1-dynamo  @xcite proposed to explain the dynamo action in the earth s core that is responsible for the geomagnetic field . from the rattleback rigid - body equations of motion one can extract a prototypical rattleback system ( called here prs ) composed of three first order quadratically coupled differential equations  @xcite , a system that is arguably the simplest model containing the essential features of chiral dynamics .",
    "it is the further study of the prs that is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "although dissipation plays a role in most investigations of rattleback dynamics , we will see that the ideal no - slip , non - dissipative limit , which yields the prs , has an intriguing hamiltonian structure that contains essential elements of the dynamics .",
    "this prs hamiltonian structure is akin to that of spin systems or euler s equations for the free rigid body ( e.g.   @xcite ) , where the poisson bracket has a nonstandard degenerate form , but retains algebraic properties so as to be a realization of a lie algebra on phase space functions .",
    "this hamiltonian form has been called noncanonical since it is one in terms of variables that are not canonically conjugate , and a special form of such noncanonical poisson brackets that are defined by any finite - dimensional lie algebra are known as a lie - poisson brackets ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "lie - poisson brackets exist for a variety of systems ; for example , the lie - poisson bracket for euler s equations for the rigid body is associated with the lie algebra @xmath2 and that for the equations describing the kida vortex of fluid mechanics is associated with the lie algebra @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , these examples represent two of nine three - dimensional real lie algebras of the bianchi classification used for homogeneous cosmologies in general relativity ( e.g.  @xcite ) , by which they are referred to as type @xmath4 and type @xmath5 , respectively",
    ". remarkably we will see that the prs corresponds to type @xmath6 with @xmath7 of this classification , which to our knowledge is the first time a lie - poisson bracket for this rather unfamiliar algebra has been identified for a natural physical system .",
    "a beneficial consequence of the lie - poisson construction for these three - dimensional systems is an immediate geometrical characterization of the dynamics .",
    "all such lie - poisson systems possess two constants of motion : the hamiltonian as expected and a casimir invariant that aries from degeneracy of the poisson bracket .",
    "consequently , all of these systems are integrable and the intersection of the surfaces of the two constants of motion determines the global qualitative nature of the solution . for example , for the free rigid body the casimir is the angular momentum sphere , and it is elementary that the intersection of this sphere with the energy ellipsoid determines the nature of the orbits , viz . , that rotation about largest and smallest principal axes are stable , while the intermediate axis is unstable .",
    "similarly , for the kida problem , the casimir hyperboloid intersecting the energy surface delineates the possible rotational , librational , or unstable dynamics of the kida vortex patch @xcite .",
    "because this common hamiltonian form occurs for all of the bianchi types , it occurs for the prs , and this immediately explains the additional intriguing first integral obtained in @xcite  it is the casimir invariant for type @xmath8 .",
    "intersection of the casimir for the prs and its hamiltonian reveals that all three variables of the system perform periodic oscillations , with the spin around the vertical axis reversing sign .",
    "the strangeness of the rattleback motion is in a sense a manifestation of the unfamiliarity of the type @xmath8 algebra .    in perturbation theory , we usually perturb the hamiltonian , the initial conditions , or the physical parameters , etc . here , unusually , we perturb the dimension of the problem by embedding the three - dimensional system into a larger , 4-dimensional phase space . in",
    "so doing we gain canonicality but lose integrability : in fact we observe chaotic reversals of the spin , which may serve as a minimum model for the reversals of the magnetic poles driven by a dynamo .",
    "the extended system is described by invoking a method of canonization discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] we begin , in section  [ subsec : rattleback ] , by recalling the prs of  @xcite , followed in section  [ subsec : hamiltonian_formalism ] by the demonstration that it is a 3-dimensional noncanonical hamiltonian system . here",
    "we review the lie - poisson construction and show the prs has the poisson bracket for type @xmath8 and that the extra invariant of @xcite is indeed the casimir invariant for this algebra . since to our knowledge",
    "a complete list of all 3-dimensional lie - poisson brackets and their casimirs does not exit in the literature , we do so in table  [ table : bianchi - casimirs ] . in section  [ sec : chirality ] , we analyze the mechanism of chirality from the perspective of hamiltonian theory .",
    "sections  [ ssec : ec - equailibrium ] and [ ssec : dyn - stab ] are devoted to the spectral analysis of linearized systems ; in particular , we show how the singularity of the lie - poisson algebra causes chiral spectra . in section  [ subsec : normal_form ] we canonize the prs by effecting a darboux transformation , showing that this system is a one degree - of - freedom hamiltonian system on the casimir constraint surface ( symplectic leaf ) .",
    "section  [ sec : phantom ] begins with section [ subsec : embedding ] where we embed the prs into a 4-dimensional phase space , thereby breaking the invariance of the casimir and allowing for chaotic motion , which is studied in section  [ subsec : chaos ] . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude our study with a discussion on broader implications of the results .",
    "we have included [ sec : dual ] , which has an alternative hamiltonian formulation where the roles of the hamiltonian and of the casimir are interchanged ; this amounts to a nonlinear deformation of the bianchi type @xmath4 ( i.e.  @xmath2 ) lie - poisson algebra ; the deformation is scaled by the aspect - ratio parameter @xmath9 ( corresponding to @xmath10 of type @xmath0 ) of the rattleback model .",
    "the equations of the prs are as follows : @xmath11 compared with equation ( 5.5 ) of @xcite , we have adopted a more felicitous notation where @xmath12 stand for the _ pitching _ , _ rolling _ , and _ spinning _ modes of the motion .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is a positive parameter that encodes the _ aspect ratio _ of the rattleback .",
    "figure  [ fig : celt0 ] shows a typical solution of the rattleback model .",
    "note that the common claim that ` the forward spin is stable whereas the backward spin is unstable ' is in fact false .",
    "both spins are unstable , but the exponents of instability are unequal .",
    "we tend not to see the forward spin go into rattling and reverse , merely because the dissipation ( friction on the floor ) kills the motion before this weak instability kicks in .",
    "the backward spin , whose instability is strong , reverses quickly while the motion lasts . in the absence of dissipation",
    "the rattleback keeps reversing back and forth , as is easily seen in table - top experiments .",
    "indeed , thanks to the hamiltonian structure discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] the system ( [ mt-1 ] ) is integrable .",
    "examination of the intersection of the hamiltonian with the casimir reveals that every orbit is periodic , as will be seen in section [ subsec : hamiltonian_formalism ] ( cf .",
    "[ fig : leaves ] ) . here",
    "we will also see how the two growth rates arise because of a singularity in the hamiltonian structure .",

    "if we take the _ hamiltonian _ @xmath26 then ( [ mt-1 ] ) is cast into the following hamilton form : @xmath27 where in the second equality the poisson bracket @xmath28 makes @xmath29 into a poisson algebra , a lie algebra realization on functions , since it is bilinear , antisymmetric , and can be shown to satisfy the jacobi identity .",

    "we study the dynamics in the regime @xmath40 ; for example it suffices to take the phase space @xmath25 to be an open set in @xmath41 on which @xmath42 is bounded away from @xmath39 .",
    "there is a systematic method for constructing poisson brackets of the form of ( [ poisson ] ) with ( [ mt - j ] ) given any lie algebra .",

    "we include these here since to our knowledge a complete listing of these lie - poisson structures does not appear in this form in the literature .",

    "having identified the prs with a lie - poisson structure , we can immediately apply the energy - casimir method to determine stability of equilibria ( e.g.  @xcite ) . because @xmath91 , where @xmath92 with @xmath93 being a lagrange multiplier , extremals of @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 , are ( relative ) equilibrium points .",

    "examination of fig .",
    "[ fig : leaves ] also reveals that in the vicinity of the four equilibrium points the orbits lie on closed curves .",
    "thus we expect all four equilibrium points to be stable .",

    "linearized equations of motion are given by @xmath107    it is easily shown that @xmath106 as given by ( [ hl ] ) is not a positive definite quadratic form which would expected for a stable equilibrium point .",
    "however , since the dynamics is constrained to a casmir leaf , it is necessary to examine the convexity of @xmath106 with variations constrained to the leaf .",
    "such variations were introduced in the context of the energy - casimir method in @xcite , where they were called dynamically accessible ( @xmath108 ) variations ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "they are given by using the poisson matrix to project the variations so as to be tangent to the leaf , as follows : @xmath109 where @xmath110 are arbitrary . inserting the @xmath108 variations into @xmath106 yields @xmath111 where use has been made of the equilibrium condition @xmath99 . because @xmath112 is positive definite we have stability , which is in agreement with the closed loop orbits seen in fig .",

    "these equations occur at a place where the rank of @xmath30 changes from two to zero and , as addressed in @xcite , are as a consequence not accessible as extremals of ordinary energy - casimir variations .",

    "the investigation of what happens in noncanonical hamiltonian systems at such rank changing places has been undertaken for both finite and infinite - dimensional systems @xcite . although the hamiltonian structure has a singularity , the equations of motion ( [ mt-1 ] ) are perfectly well - behaved .",

    "thus , if @xmath125 we have a mode that grows at a rate @xmath126 , which is faster than one that is damped at @xmath116 .",
    "this violation of the symmetry of hamiltonian spectra is a result of the fact that the rank of the poisson matrix changes at the position of the equilibrium under study . however , if @xmath127 the growing mode is smaller in absolute value than the damped mode .",
    "this asymmetry with the sign of @xmath116 , which was alluded to in section [ subsec : rattleback ] , was analyzed in @xcite , where it was concluded that dissipation tends to damp dynamics near @xmath127 because of the smaller growth rate in the nondissipative system .",
    "however these growth rates are somewhat an artifact of the peculiar equilibrium - stability analysis .",
    "if one starts near an equilibrium point @xmath128 with small values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 , with an initial condition @xmath131 , then the dynamics is accurately described by the intersection of the energy and casimir surfaces that revealed the periodic motion , both near and far from the equilibrium .",
    "we argue in section [ subsec : normal_form ] that chirality is best characterized by the asymmetry in the slope of the up and down swings of @xmath18 during this periodic motion .",
    "because of the jacobi identity for the noncanonical poisson matrix of ( [ mt - j ] ) , the lie - darboux theorem assures that @xmath30 can be transformed by shifting to coordinates with the casimir as one coordinate and a canonically conjugate pair that parametrizes the casimir leaves as the other two .",

    "the asymmetric shape of the potential energy @xmath157 tells a lot about the chirality of the rattleback . as seen in fig .",

    "suppose we send the rattleback toward positive @xmath140 .",
    "it runs up a steep potential cliff and sharply reverses the spin , turning @xmath160 from positive to negative ( cf.fig.[fig:celt0 ] ) .",
    "as it goes toward negative @xmath140 , it trots up a gentle slope and eventually turns from negative to positive @xmath161 , but the reversal is not so sharp .",
    "when @xmath162 , the asymmetry in the potential is mirrored , and the system acquires an opposite chiral preference , the negative - to - positive turn being sharper than the positive - to - negative turn .",
    "the sign of @xmath98 has no bearing on chirality .",
    "though we have explained the chiral behavior in terms of the shape of the hamiltonian ( [ mt - h(zeta) ] ) in the new coordinates @xmath163 , the root cause of the asymmetry , in the original coordinates @xmath164 , is the _ skewness _ of the casimir surface ( @xmath20 const . ) against the background of the hamiltonian ( [ mt - h ] ) symmetric with respect to all the variables .",
    "thus , the chiral dynamics of a rattleback originates from the geometry of the bianchi type vi lie algebra .",
    "this is made clear by fig.[fig : celt0 ] , the chirality of the rattleback motion is all about the rate of change of the spin @xmath18 , not about @xmath18 itself .",

    "the rattleback is a rigid body whose ellipsoid of inertia is skewed with respect to the geometry ( principal axes ) of the contact surface .",
    "it is an asymmetric body that moves in a symmetric space , which is the origin of the chirality of the dynamics .",
    "however , the curious guiding idea of this paper is that we can reformulate the dynamics as if a symmetric body were moving in an asymmetric space  recall the formalism of section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] , where the hamiltonian is symmetric but there is something asymmetric in the phase space of the bianchi type @xmath8 lie - poisson algebra .",
    "the chirality , then , comes from the skewness of the casimir leaves .",
    "philosophically , it is interesting to think of the interchangeability of a hamiltonian and a casimir as a duality between matter and space .",
    "in fact , we can recast the rattle - back equation into an alternative hamiltonian system with exchanged casimir and hamiltonian ( see [ sec : dual ] ) .",
    "a complex material system may be made simple by transferring complexity to the geometry of space ; conversely , a skewed space may be made flat by skewing the matter or the energy .",
    "the list of bianchi algebras ( table  [ table : bianchi - casimirs ] ) provides us with plenty of possibilities for such a transfer .",

    "the system ( [ mt-1 ] ) has two first integrals , @xmath200 and @xmath201 . in the hamiltonian system of section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] , they are the hamiltonian and a casimir .",
    "we can interchange their roles in a dual hamiltonian system .",
    "consider the co - symplectic matrix @xmath202 this time @xmath100 is a casimir , while the hamiltonian @xmath98 gives the equation of motion  ( [ mt-1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath203 is not linear in @xmath204 , the bracket @xmath205 is not lie - poisson ( except in the case @xmath206 , when @xmath203 is the @xmath2 lie - poisson matrix ) .",
    "but there is a nonlinear change of coordinates @xmath207 which turns @xmath203 into an @xmath2 matrix @xmath208 guided by the common casimir @xmath209 for @xmath203 and @xmath210 ( classified as bianchi type ix ) , we can transform @xmath211 so that @xmath212 where the intermediate expression @xmath213 is the darboux normal form ; the eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue is @xmath214 , hence we choose @xmath215 ( the factor 2 simplifies formulas later ) .",
    "since @xmath17 was what complicated @xmath203 , we choose @xmath216 .",
    "then the determining condition for @xmath217 is @xmath218 which is readily integrated along the characteristics @xmath219 to give @xmath220 .",
    "thus @xmath221 the transformation @xmath222 is the backtrack of the similar transformation @xmath223 : @xmath224 inverting this relation , we find @xmath225   \\\\ r \\\\ \\sqrt{p^2+s^2}\\sin [ r^{1-\\lambda}\\arctan(s / p ) ] \\end{array } \\right ) .\\ ] ] a direct calculation verifies @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 . inverting one step further , @xmath229   \\\\ \\xi_2 \\\\",
