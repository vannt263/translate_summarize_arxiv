    "the diffuse ultraviolet ( uv ) background was first detected by @xcite but its faintness and the need for space - borne observations rendered progress slow for the next few decades ( reviewed by @xcite and @xcite with a recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "there have been three large scale surveys of the diffuse ultraviolet sky over the last two decades .",
    "the first was the nuviews ( narrowband ultraviolet imaging experiment for wide - field surveys ) rocket flight @xcite which observed about 25% of the sky and noted the strong enhancement toward the galactic plane with other bright spots near star forming regions such as ophiuchus .",
    "more recently , the spear / fims mission carried out a spectroscopic uv survey of the sky @xcite and the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ) observed about 75% of the sky in two ultraviolet bands @xcite .",
    "the greatest part of the diffuse background , particularly at low latitudes , is thought to be due to starlight scattered by interstellar dust grains @xcite and models of the background have taken the incoming starlight and scattered it from the grains with different assumptions for the distribution of the exciting stars and the scattering dust @xcite .",
    "the availability of the all - sky _ galex _  data provides a powerful incentive to revisit the nature of the diffuse background with a consistent set of data and a unified modelling approach .",
    "such deviations from dust scattered predictions may have important consequences for our understanding of the evolution of galaxies and the dynamical history of the universe @xcite .",
    "i will describe here a new model of the dust scattered background and its application to the _ galex",
    "_  observations in its two ultraviolet bands .",
    "the _ galex _  spacecraft and its mission has been described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spacecraft was operational from 2003 june 7 until 2013 june 28 and observed most of the sky with a resolution of 5  10  in two uv bands .",
    "the fuv ( 1521  ) detector was plagued with intermittent failures of the high voltage power supply ( hvps ) and finally ceased to work after 2009 may while the nuv ( 2361  ) instrument took data until the spacecraft was shut down .",
    "most of the observations were made at high galactic latitudes to avoid damage to the detectors from the bright diffuse background but there was a concerted effort to map brighter regions , including at low galactic latitudes , near the end of the mission .",
    "unfortunately , the fuv detector had already failed by this time so there are very few fuv observations at low latitudes .",
    "@xcite used the _ galex _",
    "data to construct maps of the diffuse background in both the fuv and nuv bands at @xmath4 spatial resolution with the foreground emission ( airglow and zodiacal light ) subtracted ( fig .",
    "[ obs_stars ] ) .",
    "the 1000 brightest stars are overplotted on the images as + signs with the size of the symbol proportional to the log of the brightness .",
    "gould s belt is prominent in both bands as are halos around a number of bright stars @xcite . a full description of the methodology in the production of these maps is given in the paper and the maps are available from the high level science products ( hlsp ) data repository at the space telescope science institute .",
    "the radiative transfer problem in galaxies has been reviewed by @xcite with the much simpler problem of scattering only addressed in their section 5.1 .",
    "the problem can be broken into three parts : the stellar distribution ; the dust distribution ; and the scattering function .",
    "photons are emitted by the stars and are scattered by the interstellar dust to the detector .",
    "the scattering function is commonly assumed to be the henyey - greenstein function @xcite which is dependent on two free parameters : the albedo or reflectivity ( @xmath5 ) and the phase function asymmetry factor ( @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 implies that the grains scatter isotropically and @xmath8 implies fully forward scattering grains .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that the scattering may be more complex with a possible reverse scattering component but the data have not yet been good enough to support added complexity in the scattering function .",
    "@xcite showed that the interstellar radiation field in the uv could be calculated through an integration over the stars in a standard catalog . in this work ,",
    "i have used the hipparcos catalog @xcite which contains over 100,000 stars with the spectral type , b and v magnitude and distance of each star .",
    "i modelled the spectrum of each star using template spectra from @xcite with the translation from spectral type to model number as per their instructions .",
    "i then calculated the observed e(b - v ) from the cataloged b and v magnitudes and the intrinsic ( b - v ) and finally the unreddened flux from each star assuming the milky way extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "this is the source function in my model : the number of photons from each star at the wavelength of interest .",
    "i have tried two dust distributions in order to explore their effects on the scattered light . in the first ( model 1 ) , i have assumed that the gas density at the galactic plane ( n[h ] ) is 1 atom @xmath9 , independent of longitude . in the second ( model 2 ) , i scaled the dust to match the observed e(b - v ) from @xcite in model 2 . in both cases , i assumed that there was a cavity of radius 80 pc around the sun , corresponding to the local bubble @xcite , and that the dust fell off from the galactic plane with a scale height of 125 pc @xcite .",
    "i have plotted the correlation between the observed and the modelled e(b - v ) for the two models in fig .",
    "[ pred_model_ebv ] .",
    "my purpose in implementing these different models was to explore the factors affecting dust scattering rather than to accurately represent the distribution of interstellar dust .",
    "a full radiative transfer model is complex because it is non - linear , non - local and multiwavelength in its formulation ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "i am only concerned with the scattering of photons at single wavelengths which is a much simpler problem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) .",
    "i have written a set of routines in ansi c which are available from the ascl @xcite .",
    "the program is intended for use in the uv where the source distribution is well characterized and the volume of space is limited because of the high optical depth to uv radiation .",
    "however , the code is modular and documented and may be freely modified for other purposes .",
    "my code is very similar to other monte carlo programs to predict the scattered light ( eg .",
    "i will illustrate the program flow in my implementation by following a single photon through its multiple scatterings .",
    "i generate a new random number from a uniform distribution in each step below except in steps 2 and 5 where two numbers are needed to determine the direction of the photon .",
    "i have used the genunf ( generate a random number from a uniform distribution ) function from the randlib library to generate the random numbers and , if necessary , weighted the distribution to match the desired probabilities .    1 .",
    "a photon is emitted from a random star , where the probability of selecting a given star is weighted by the relative number of photons from that star , in a random direction .",
    "each photon begins with a unit weight which will be reduced at each scattering .",
    "2 .   two random numbers are generated to calculate the direction of motion , one for theta ( in the range from 0  @xmath10 , measured from the z axis ) and one for phi ( in the range from 0  @xmath11 ) .",
    "the position of the star is known ( from the hipparcos catalog ) in cartesian coordinates ( x , y , z ) and the angles are converted into a direction vector assuming a step size of 1 bin .",
    "another random number is generated to determine the optical depth the photon travels .",
    "i have divided the galaxy into 1000 x 1000 x 1000 cells with a side of 1 pc and filled each cell with dust as per the individual model .",
    "the cross - section of the dust was taken from @xcite , which is a parametrization of the canonical extinction curve with r @xmath12 , the so - called milky way dust .",
    "i then follow the photon along until the cumulative optical depth along the path exceeds the predetermined value .",
    "this yields the cartesian coordinates x , y , and z of the scattering location .",
    "i use the `` effective peeling '' technique @xcite to send a fraction of the photon back to the detector and subtract this ( small ) amount of energy from the effective weight of the photon . the detector in this case is assumed to observe the entire sky with an angular resolution of 0.1@xmath13 per square bin .",
    "the effective weight of the photon is reduced by the albedo and a new scattering direction is determined as in step 2 .",
    "the z direction is now the original direction of motion with the change of reference back to the original cartesian coordinates using a rotation angle matrix .",
    "the procedure is repeated from step 3 until the effective weight of the photon drops below a predetermined factor or the number of scatterings exceeds a specified limit ( _ nscatter _ ) .",
    "note that single scattering corresponds to @xmath14 . in that case ,",
    "the photon stops at the first interaction but the effective peeling method results in a flux at the detector .",

    "the flux saturates at about 5 scatterings per photon and i have therefore capped the number of scatters at that level leading to a significant savings in execution time without affecting the total flux .",

    "even at the lowest reddening , multiple scattering gives about 25% more flux rising to about 40% more by e(b - v ) = 1.5 , although the exact value will depend on the local geometry between the stars and the dust .",
    "much of this excess is simply because the photon still carries energy after the first interaction which is disregarded in the single scattering assumption .     for different values of the albedo ( see legend ) .",

[ flux_with_albedo ] and [ flux_with_g ] . unlike the single scattering case where the total flux should rise linearly with the albedo , the total flux rises as approximately the square of the albedo when multiple scattering is taken into account",
    ". the flux decreases with increasing @xmath15 as the photon is more likely to stay within the galaxy for isotropic scattering and there are more scatterings per photon .",
    "the above results depend little on the distribution of the dust .",
    "on the other hand the distance of the scattering locations from the sun depends on the dust distribution but not on the optical parameters .",

    "the model predictions are close to the observed values at low and mid - latitudes for low optical depths .",
    "the fit is poorer at larger optical depths where the geometry is more complex",
    "there is reasonable agreement between the model ( @xmath39 ) and the data at high latitudes but with considerable scatter .",
    "there is an offset of 300  700 ph  @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 @xmath3  in both bands and at all latitudes which can not be due to dust scattered radiation .",
    "@xcite estimated that the residual airglow was 220 ph  @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 @xmath3  in the fuv and 350 ph  @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 @xmath3  in the nuv implying that the offset at high latitudes is 100 and 250 ph  @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 @xmath3  in the fuv and nuv bands , respectively .",
    "this is the component that is usually identified with extragalactic light @xcite .",
    "the offsets are larger at low latitudes and may be due to unaccounted sources such as molecular hydrogen emission or as yet undetermined sources @xcite .",
    "i have tabulated results from the literature in table [ ag_table ] . in most cases ,",
    "i have taken the results as specified by the authors which are difficult to translate into the @xmath45 results more often seen . in all cases ,",
    "there is enough uncertainty in the data and the modelling that the formal limits are suggestive rather than definitive .",
    "there are a range of preferred values for the optical constants and the offset but i hope that the volume of data and improved modelling will yield tighter constraints on the dust properties .",
    "i have released the software under a non - restrictive license @xcite and have uploaded the model files to a public archive @xcite .",
    "these files are the runs for model 2 for a range of the optical constants and may be used for comparison with the diffuse background in the milky way . if an estimate of the diffuse flux is all that is needed , the file for @xmath17 and @xmath46 may be used at both 1500   and 2300  .",
    "although the overall fits are encouraging , there are a number of questions raised by the differences between the model and the observations .",
    "the local geometry of the exciting stars and the scattering dust are important in determining the diffuse background over much of the sky and their effects can be seen in fig .",
    "[ obs_stars ] where there are extended halos around bright stars such as spica",
    ". there have been important new studies of the 3-dimensional distribution of the dust , most recently by @xcite , which i will implement .",
    "it is likely that , at least in some parts of the sky , observations of the scattering will be better able to constrain the distance and density of the dust clouds than the standard extinction methods @xcite .",
    "one of the major constraints in this work is the noise intrinsic to monte carlo modelling which can only be reduced by increasing the number of photons .",
    "fortunately , monte carlo lend themselves well to modern hpc ( high - performance computing ) methods as well as processing on the gpu ( graphics processing unit ) and the next step is to port the software to that environment .",
