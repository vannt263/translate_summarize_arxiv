    "most of these are large star - forming complexes where the geometry and conditions are difficult to ascertain .",
    "bright - rimmed cometary globules ( cgs ) are simpler structures where triggering processes may be active and thus offer an opportunity for understanding better the mechanisms at work .",
    "these are small , isolated clouds with dense cores surrounded by ionized rims facing the exciting star and tails extending in the opposite direction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "cgs likely originate as dense clumps in the parental molecular clouds that have emerged after the dispersion of lower density gas by ultraviolet radiation from ob stars .",

    "the central region of ic  1396 was previously studied with the lower resolution @xmath19 observatory @xcite but the northern part of the nebula with the ic  1396n globule was off the field .",

    "the source significance , calculated by _",

    "are identified with 2mass nir counterparts ( last column in table [ tbl_bsp ] ) .",
    "median @xmath44 separations agree well with that derived from the coup project @xcite : they are better than @xmath45 at the central part of the acis - i field , and @xmath46 at larger off - axis angles .",
    "twenty nine of the 51 sources without nir detections have hard spectra with median energy @xmath47 kev . of these , five are probably newly discovered protostars in the globule (  [ globule_cluster_section ] ) .",
    "the remaining 24 are candidates for extragalactic contaminants ( consistent with the extragalactic prediction described below ) .",

    "the ic  1396 and cepheus b star forming regions have similar galactic directions ( @xmath25 and @xmath49 respectively ) with approximately the same distance from the sun .",

    "the discovery of relatively high numbers of quite massive , x - ray luminous protostars in ic  1396n globule from a short @xmath0 exposure suggests that either a population of still - unidentified lower mass protostars is present , implying an unusually high ratio of class i/0 @xmath159 class ii / iii systems , or the triggering process produces a non - standard imf biased towards higher mass stars .",
