    "the probable role of thermonuclear reactions in generating energy within the solar interior was recognized as early as the 1920s by astrophysicists such as eddington @xcite .",
    "this deduction came about by default , rather than by any direct laboratory observation of the reactions . once the earth s age was established to be at least a few billion years old ( see burchfield @xcite for an interesting history of the development of this idea )",
    ", it became apparent that gravitational and chemical energy sources could not sustain solar evolution , given the known mass , radius , and luminosity of the sun .",
    "in contrast , newly discovered nuclear reactions and decays could readily supply the required energy over the requisite time .",
    "a key step was taken by gamow @xcite , who recognized that tunnelling under the coulomb barrier could enable nuclear reactions to occur at the low energies typical of the solar interior , where _ kt _",
    "@xmath0 a few kev ( _ e.g. _ , atkinson @xmath1 houtermans @xcite ) .",
    "this idea and subsequent investigations led to descriptions of possible reaction chains for stellar energy generation . by the end of the 1930s weizsacker @xcite , bethe @xmath1 critchfield @xcite , and",
    "bethe @xcite had described the essential features of the carbon - nitrogen cycle and the proton  proton chain , the processes by which the sun and similar stars convert hydrogen to helium .",
    "the neutrino has a similar vintage , and was connected early on to stellar reactions . in december 1930",
    "wolfgang pauli proposed that the emission of an unobserved spin1/2 neutral particle ",
    "the electron neutrino ( @xmath2 )  might explain the apparent lack of energy conservation in nuclear beta decay    @xmath3    enrico fermi was present at a number of pauli s presentations and discussed the neutrino with him on these occasions . in 1934 , following closely chadwick s discovery of the neutron , fermi proposed a theory of beta decay based on dirac s description of electromagnetic interactions , but with weak currents interacting at a point , rather than at long distance through the electromagnetic field .",
    "he described beta decay as a proton decaying to a neutron , a phenomenon energetically possible because of nuclear binding energies , with the emission of a positron and neutrino .",
    "apart from the absence of parity violation , which would not be discovered until 1957 , fermi s description is a correct low - energy approximation to our current standard model of weak interactions .",
    "thus , as nuclear astrophysicists unravelled the stellar processes for hydrogen burning , stars were recognized to be copious sources of neutrinos    @xmath4    this observation led ray davis to construct the chlorine experiment to measure the flux of solar neutrinos .",
    "the resulting solar neutrino puzzle was ultimately traced to new physics ( neutrino oscillations ) requiring the mixing of massive neutrinos , a phenomenon beyond the standard electroweak model .",
    "this discovery depended critically on the reliability of solar model neutrino flux predictions , and thus on the quality of our understanding of the nuclear reaction rates governing the pp and cn cycles .",
    "the goal of this paper is to summarize our understanding of solar hydrogen burning , with special emphasis on the connections between laboratory astrophysics ",
    "measurement of nuclear cross sections at or near energies characteristic of the solar core  and the predictions of solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "observations of stars reveal a wide variety of stellar conditions , with luminosities relative to solar spanning a range @xmath5",
    "10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 @xmath8 and surface temperatures @xmath9200050000 k. the simplest relation one could propose between luminosity @xmath10 and @xmath11 is that for a blackbody    @xmath12    which suggests that stars of a similar structure might lie along a one  parameter path ( corresponding to @xmath13 above ) in the luminosity ( or magnitude ) vs.  temperature ( or color ) plane .",
    "in fact , there is a dominant path in the hertzsprung  russell color  magnitude diagram along which roughly 80@xmath14 of the stars reside .",
    "this is the main sequence , those stars supporting themselves by hydrogen burning through the pp chain or cn cycles .",
    "as one such star , the sun is an important test of our theory of main sequence stellar evolution :  its properties    age , mass , surface composition , luminosity , and helioseismology  ",
    "are by far the most accurately known among the stars .",
    "the standard solar model ( ssm ) traces the evolution of the sun over the past 4.6 billion years of main sequence burning , thereby predicting the present  day temperature and composition profiles , the relative strengths of competing nuclear reaction chains , and the neutrino fluxes resulting from those chains .",
    "standard solar models share four basic assumptions :    * the sun evolves in hydrostatic equilibrium , maintaining a local balance between the gravitational force and the pressure gradient . to describe this condition in detail",
    ", one must specify the equation of state as a function of temperature , density , and composition .",
    "* energy is transported by radiation and convection . while the solar envelope is convective , radiative transport dominates in the core region where thermonuclear reactions take place .",
    "the opacity depends sensitively on the solar composition , particularly the abundances of heavier elements .",
    "* thermonuclear reaction chains generate solar energy .",
    "the standard model predicts that over 98@xmath14 of this energy is produced from the pp chain conversion of four protons into @xmath15he ( see fig .  1 ) , with proton burning through the cn cycle contributing the remaining 2@xmath14 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the sun is a large but slow reactor :  the core temperature , @xmath161.5 @xmath17 10@xmath18 k , results in typical center - of - mass energies for reacting particles of @xmath0 10 kev , much less than the coulomb barriers inhibiting charged particle nuclear reactions .",
    "thus reaction cross sections are small : in most cases , laboratory measurements are only possible at higher energies , so that cross section data must be extrapolated to the solar energies of interest .",
    "* the model is constrained to produce today s solar radius , mass , and luminosity .",
    "an important assumption of the standard model is that the sun was highly convective , and therefore uniform in composition , when it first entered the main sequence .",
    "it is furthermore assumed that the surface abundances of metals ( nuclei with a @xmath19 5 ) were undisturbed by the subsequent evolution , and thus provide a record of the initial solar metalicity .",
    "the remaining parameter is the @xmath15he / h ratio , which is adjusted until the model reproduces the present solar luminosity after 4.6 billion years of evolution .",
    "the resulting @xmath15he / h mass fraction ratio is typically 0.27 @xmath20 0.01 , which can be compared to the big ",
    "bang value of 0.23 @xmath20 0.01 .",
    "note that the sun was formed from previously processed material .",
    "the model that emerges is an evolving sun . as the core s chemical composition changes , the opacity and core temperature rise , producing a 44@xmath14 luminosity increase since its arrival on the main sequence .",
    "the temperature rise governs the competition between the three cycles of the pp chain :  the ppi cycle dominates below about 1.6 @xmath17 10@xmath18 k ;  the ppii cycle between ( 1.72.3 ) @xmath17 10@xmath18 k ;  and the ppiii above 2.4 @xmath17 10@xmath18 k. the central core temperature of today is about 1.55 @xmath17 10@xmath18 k.    this competition between the cycles determines the pattern of neutrino fluxes .",
    "one consequence of the thermal evolution of our sun is the relatively recent appearance of a significant @xmath21b neutrino flux , the species that dominated the davis experiment . as this flux is produced in the ppiii cycle , it is a very sensitive function of the solar core .",
    "the ssm predicts an exponential increase in this flux with a doubling period of about 0.9 billion years .",
    "a final aspect of ssm evolution is the formation of composition gradients on nuclear burning timescales .",
    "clearly there is a gradual enrichment of the solar core in @xmath15he , the ashes of the pp  chain .",
    "another element , @xmath22he , is produced and then consumed in the pp chain , eventually reaching some equilibrium abundance . the time ",
    "scale for equilibrium to be established as well as the eventual equilibrium abundance are both sharply decreasing functions of temperature , and thus increasing functions of the distance from the center of the core .",
    "thus a steep @xmath22he density gradient is established over time .",
    "the ssm has had some notable successes . from helioseismology the sound speed profile",
    "@xmath23 has been very accurately determined for the outer 90@xmath14 of the sun , and is in good agreement with the ssm .",
    "( however , this conclusion depends in part on inputs to the ssm :  recent calculations employing one set of revised opacities do show some significant discrepancies , as we will discuss later . )",
    "helioseismology probes important predictions of the ssm , such as the depth of the convective zone .",
    "the ssm is not a complete model in that it does not attempt to describe from first principles aspects such as convection that extend beyond 1d descriptions .",
    "for this reason certain features of solar structure , such as the depletion of surface li by two orders of magnitude , are not reproduced .",
    "li destruction is often attributed to convective processes that operated at some epoch in our sun s history , dredging li to a depth where burning takes place .",
    "perhaps the key step that allowed quantitative modelling of the sun and other main  sequence stars was the description of the relevant nuclear reaction chains .",
    "this required both the development of a theory for sub  barrier fusion reactions and careful laboratory measurements to constraint the rates of these reactions at stellar temperatures .    at the temperatures and densities in the solar interior ( _ e.g. _ ,",
    "@xmath24 15 @xmath17 10@xmath7 k and @xmath25 153 g / cm@xmath22 @xcite ) , interacting nuclei reach a maxwellian equilibrium distribution in a time that is infinitesimal compared to nuclear reaction time scales .",
    "therefore , the reaction rate between two nuclei can written as ( _ e.g. _ , burbidge _ et al .",

    "it follows that the relative velocity distribution is also a maxwell  boltzmann , governed by the reduced mass @xmath37 of the colliding nuclei ,    @xmath38    therefore ,    @xmath39^{1/2 } \\ , \\int_0^\\infty \\ , e \\ , \\sigma \\ , ( e ) \\mbox { exp } \\ ,",

    "almost all of the nuclear reactions relevant to solar energy generation are nonresonant and charged  particle induced .",

    "the experiment was remarkable in several respects .",
    "it was the first to measure solar neutrinos in real time .",
    "it exploited the sharp forward peaking of the scattered electrons , in the direction of the incident neutrino , to extract solar neutrino events from a significant but isotropic background .",
    "the `` pointing '' of events back to the sun provided the first direct evidence that neutrinos originated from the sun .",
    "super  kamiokande , the massive 50kton successor to kamiokande , collected 1496 days of solar neutrino data over its first run , from may 1996 through july 2001 . with its high pmt coverage ( 40@xmath14 ) , lower threshold ( @xmath0 5 mev ) , and much larger fiducial volume ( 22.5 ktons ) , super  kamiokande collected data at a rate @xmath0 100 times faster than that of its predecessor , kamiokande .",
    "the result was an extraordinary set of precise measurements of the flux , recoil electron spectrum , and seasonal ( earth s orbital eccentricity ) and day / night ( earth regeneration of neutrinos ) time variations of the solar neutrinos .",
    "the experiment placed a significant constraint on the hep flux ( @xmath181 7.3 @xmath17 10@xmath15/@xmath241s , a limit about 10 times the bp04 prediction ) and on various exotic neutrino properties , such as magnetic moments .",

    "the sno detector was built deep in the creighton @xmath2429 nickel mine in sudbury , ontario , for the purpose of determining the flavor content of the @xmath21b solar neutrino flux . a central acrylic vessel containing one kiloton of heavy water",

    "the nc reaction , which is observed through the produced neutron , provides no spectral information , but does measure the total solar neutrino flux , independent of flavor .",
    "the sno experiment has used two techniques for measuring the neutrons . in the initial sno",

    "2.7 tons of salt was added to the heavy water so that cl would be present to enhance the capture , producing 8.6 mev gammas .",
    "the nc and cc events can be separated reasonably well because of the modest backward peaking ( @xmath01  ",
    "cos(@xmath245/3 ) in the angular distribution of the latter .",
    "this allowed the experimenters to determine the total and electron neutrino fraction of the solar neutrino flux . a third phase has begun in which direct neutron detection is provided in pure d@xmath127o by an array of @xmath22he  filled proportional counters .",
    "the es , which we noted previously measures electron and heavy - flavor neutrinos , but with reduced sensitivity to the latter , is the same reaction exploited by super ",
    "because the sno volume is smaller , the sno es statistics are reduced . however , the lower sno backgrounds lead to a smaller systematic error , so that the overall the sno and super  kamiokande sensitivities are comparable . because the es and cc scattered electrons are measured in the same detector , the es reaction provides an important cross check on the consistency of the results from the cc and nc channel .",

    "this paper has reviewed two problems .",
    "the first was the 70year effort to understand solar energy generation and stellar evolution as a consequence of the thermonuclear reactions occurring in the interiors of stars .",
    "it led to collaborations between solar modelers , who constructed codes to describe the evolution of our sun and to predict its helioseismology and neutrino production , and laboratory experimentalists , who provided the nuclear reaction data essential to the ssm .",
    "the second was the nearly 40year program to measure the flux , flavor , and spectrum of solar neutrinos .",
    "this effort began with the pioneering experiment of ray davis , jr .  and his collaborators at homestake , and led to the current generation of sophisticated active detectors , sno and super  kamiokande .    both programs required great patience ",
    "years of effort to refine the ssm and to develop better solar neutrino detection techniques  before it became clear that the resolution of the solar neutrino problem had to be new physics .",
    "that resolution included a new phenomenon , matter enhancement of neutrino oscillations , which altered our view of neutrino oscillations and opened up new experimental tests , such as spectral distortions and day  night effects .",
    "this further motivated the development of robust detectors like sno and super  kamiokande .",
    "the conclusion that was reached after decades of work is quite profound :  the solar neutrino discrepancy first identified by davis is due to new particle physics , neutrino oscillations .",
    "this phenomenon lies outside the minimal standard model , requiring massive neutrinos and a nontrivial relationship between mass and weak  interaction eigenstates .",
    "analyses that take into account not only the solar neutrino data described above , but also the kamland reactor neutrino data @xcite , conclude @xcite        where @xmath255 is the neutrino mixing angle and m@xmath256 and m@xmath127 the mass eigenvalues .",
    "the kamland data are very important in further constraining the mass difference and thus the vacuum oscillation length .",
    "this explanation of the solar neutrino puzzle raises new questions .",
    "what accounts for the scale of neutrino masses , a scale so different from other standard - model fermion masses ?",
    "why are neutrino mixing angles large ? ( the corresponding atmospheric  neutrino mixing angle @xmath257 is maximal , to within measurement uncertainties . )",
    "there are many parameters in the neutrino mixing matrix not yet determined .",
    "these include the absolute scale of neutrino mass , the hierarchy ( where the nearly degenerate pair of neutrinos that participate in solar neutrino oscillations are lighter than or heavier than the third neutrino ) , the size of the third mixing angle @xmath258 , the charge conjugation properties of neutrinos ( that is , whether the masses are generated from majorana or dirac mass terms ) , and the size of the cp  violating phases that appear in the mixing matrix . the answers to these questions could help point the way to important extensions of the standard model .",
    "one of the most remarkable outcomes of the solar ( and atmospheric ) neutrino problems is that the neutrino mass differences that emerged are in a range accessible to terrestrial experiments with accelerator and reactor neutrinos , such as kamland . despite the importance of future terrestrial experiments  such as double beta decay searches for majorana masses and long - baseline neutrino experiments to look for cp violation",
    " solar neutrinos still have an important role to play .",
    "for the foreseeable future ( _ e.g. _ , until beta beams are developed ) , solar neutrinos will remain our only intense source of electron neutrinos .",
    "some future goals that might be reached by exploiting these neutrinos include @xcite :    * _ a low  energy solar neutrino measurement to test the consequences of a large @xmath259 _ one feature of the accepted lma ( large mixing angle ) neutrino oscillation explanation of current data is that the survival probability for low energy neutrinos is substantially higher than that for the @xmath21b electron neutrinos measured in sno s cc channel .",
    "verifying this prediction is important .    * _ future high  statistics pp solar neutrino experiments to improve our knowledge of @xmath259 _ solar neutrino experiments are the primary source of information on @xmath249m@xmath260 and @xmath255 . while kamland has helped to narrow the lma solution region in @xmath249m@xmath260 , neither it nor borexino will appreciably improve our knowledge of the mixing angle .",
    "a pp solar neutrino measurement with an uncertainty of 3@xmath14 would constrain @xmath255 with an accuracy comparable to that possible with the entire existing set of solar neutrino data . thus",

    "sterile neutrinos with even small couplings to active species can have profound cosmological effects .",
    "the coupling of @xmath2s to sterile states can be limited by cc and nc measurements with an accurately known neutrino source .",
    "kamland ( together with the sno cc and nc data ) should ultimately limit the sterile component of @xmath21b neutrinos to @xmath0 13@xmath14 .",
