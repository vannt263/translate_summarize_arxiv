    "turbulent flows are characterized by strong fluctuations of the velocity field .",
    "one aspect of their study focuses on the statistics of these fluctuations at the small spatial scales  @xcite . in spite of the fluctuating nature of the flow , coherent structures appear at large scales in many cases .",
    "two - dimensional turbulence is a prototypical situation where large scale coherent structures emerge  @xcite , but this also happens in different contexts , for instance in three - dimensional flows in the presence of rotation  @xcite .",
    "geophysical flows constitute a vivid illustration of the coexistence between small - scale turbulence and long - lived structures and mean flows up to the planetary scale .",
    "a first step in the understanding of the emergence of large scale mean flows and coherent structures resides in the notion of _ inverse cascade_. it is well known that two - dimensional flows , due to the existence of two quadratic , positive - definite inviscid invariants , the energy and the enstrophy , exhibit a dual cascade scenario  @xcite : the nonlinear interactions tend to push enstrophy downscale while energy is pulled towards the large scales .",
    "inverse cascades have been subsequently investigated in three dimensional flows , mostly in the presence of anisotropic effects which induce a flow behavior which is reminiscent of two - dimensional turbulence , like rotation or stratification .",
    "geophysical flows are strongly dominated by such effects , to the extent that they are well described by the asymptotic regime called _ quasi - geostrophy _ , corresponding to small rossby and froude numbers . in this regime ,",
    "the flow is quasi two - dimensional , and there are conservation laws analogous to the two - dimensional case , which lead to the existence of an inverse cascade  @xcite . outside the quasi - geostrophic regime ,",
    "inverse cascades have been reported in numerical simulations of rotating / stratified flows  @xcite , although the relative roles of balanced and unbalanced motions are not yet completely clear  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent research has also reported cases of inverse energy cascade in three - dimensional , helically constrained flows  @xcite , like beltrami flows in a von krmn experiment  @xcite and decimated numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "a valuable tool in the study of inverse cascades is statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "following the pioneering work of lee  @xcite , kraichnan  @xcite introduced simple gibbs ensemble methods for a galerkin truncation of the inviscid system to obtain the spectra at absolute equilibrium for the energy and enstrophy in a two - dimensional flow .",
    "the study of these spectra shows that for some values of the lagrange parameters associated with energy and enstrophy conservation , the energy is expected to condense at the large scales  @xcite .",
    "more recently , miller  @xcite and robert and sommeria  @xcite developed a mean - field theory which explains that due to conservation laws , large scale coherent structures emerge as the most probable outcome of turbulent mixing .",
    "their approach even provides a relation ( between vorticity and stream function ) which characterizes the large scale mean flows eventually produced by this process .",
    "the solutions of this equation are called the _ equilibrium states _ of the system , and constitute a sub - class of the steady - states admitted by the system .",
    "the theory therefore predicts which type of coherent structures ( e.g. monopoles , dipoles , jets , rings , ... ) are expected to develop depending only on a few macroscopic parameters , the conserved quantities of the dynamical equations .",
    "this information is summarized in the _ phase diagram _ of the system .",
    "equilibrium states and phase diagrams have mostly been computed for two - dimensional flows for various domain geometries  @xcite , and quasi two - dimensional models describing the large scales of geophysical flows , dominated by rotation and stratification , but often neglecting the vertical dimension , like in the equivalent barotropic model  @xcite .",
    "early studies had considered cases of interest for geophysical flows in the framework of the kraichnan spectrally truncated theory .",
    "salmon , holloway and hendershott  @xcite thus showed that the large scales ( larger than the internal radius of deformation ) of a two - layer quasi - geostrophic flow tend to behave as a barotropic flow , while the small scales ( smaller than the internal radius of deformation ) in each layer are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "however , their study relies on the presence of a bottom topography , as it is well - known that the spectrally truncated theory does not predict any mean - flow in the absence of bottom topography ( in fact , this is an issue of spontaneous symmetry breaking , which vanishes in the mean - field theory ) . in a similar framework",
    ", merryfield  @xcite showed that continuously stratified quasi - geostrophic models confirmed the tendency to barotropization , while improving the representation of the energetics of the system .",
    "it is only recently that this thread was taken up in the context of the miller - robert - sommeria ( mrs ) theory ; venaille  @xcite proved that for continuously stratified quasi - geostrophic flows above a bottom topography , large scale flows with a major fraction of the energy trapped near in bottom currents could be attained as statistical equilibria .",
    "it was also confirmed that the flow tends to behave as a barotropic flow  @xcite , and the role played by the beta effect in this process was investigated .",
    "this study considered realistic cases with prescribed stratification profiles ; as a result it is difficult to build a general classification of the equilibrium states of the system .",
    "the present paper builds naturally on their work ; going back to a two - layer quasi - geostrophic model , we show that it is possible to obtain explicitly the list of all the equilibrium states as a function of the parameters of the model , for the case of a domain with spherical geometry , and discuss the consequences in terms of the horizontal and vertical transfers of energy in geostrophically balanced flows . in section [ dyneqinvsec ]",
    ", we introduce the two - layer quasi - geostrophic model and its dynamical invariants , in section [ statmechsec ] , we derive and solve the equation characterizing the statistical equilibria using the mrs theory , and in section [ stabsec ] , we prove the thermodynamic stability of these solutions and finally build the phase diagram for the system . in section [ discsec ] , we discuss the physical consequences of these results , focusing on the nonlinear transfers of energy in the vertical direction , or in other words , the ability of the fluid to transfer energy from the baroclinic mode to the barotropic mode .",
    "we consider a simple model of a stratified , rotating fluid on a domain @xmath0 , namely the _ two - layer quasi - geostrophic model_. the fluid is made up of two homogeneous layers with respective depth @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the total depth of the fluid . in each layer , the flow is described by the stream function @xmath4 . here",
    ", we will consider the case of a spherical geometry : @xmath5 .",
    "we introduce the _ potential vorticity _ in each layer by :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the first rossby deformation radius  @xcite , and @xmath8 is the coriolis parameter .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we can suppose from now on that @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) ; otherwise the dynamics in each layer is decoupled from the other layer . to keep things simple",
    ", we will not consider the effect of a bottom topography in this study , and we will restrict to the case of layers of equal depth : @xmath13 , or equivalently , @xmath14 . using poisson brackets ,",
    "the dynamics can be recast in the following form :    @xmath15    where we now have    @xmath16    the parameter @xmath17 measures the strength of the imposed stratification : the larger @xmath17 , the stronger the stratification . introducing the deformation wavenumber @xmath18",
    ", we also have @xmath19 .",
    "strong stratification therefore corresponds to smaller deformation scale .",
    "note that we are considering the inertial dynamics of the two - layer quasi - geostrophic model . in this context and in the absence of bottom topography (",
    "otherwise , one should add a prescribed topography term to the potential vorticity in the bottom layer ) , the two layers play symmetric roles , since they have the same depth : @xmath13 .",
    "hence , we expect all our results to be invariant under the transformation @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce the _ barotropic _ mode  which is simply the vertically integrated stream function , also referred to as the _ transport stream function _ :    @xmath21    in a similar way , the barotropic and baroclinic potential vorticities are given by , respectively , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we have the relations    @xmath24    the dynamics of the barotropic and baroclinic modes is given by    @xmath25    note in particular that only self - interactions of either the barotropic mode or the baroclinic mode contribute to the evolution of the barotropic mode .",
    "on the contrary , the evolution of the baroclinic mode depends on interactions between the barotropic and baroclinic mode .",
    "note that when the two layers are not of equal depth ( @xmath26 ) , there is also a non - vanishing term @xmath27 corresponding to self - interactions of the baroclinic mode in the left - hand side of . the two - layer quasi - geostrophic model can be seen as a minimal model to investigate geostrophically balanced flows with a non - trivial vertical structure : the barotropic mode plays the role of a vertically independent component , while all the vertical variation is contained in the baroclinic mode .",

    "hence , in both cases , there is a whole family of critical points with the same energy , the same angular momentum , and the same entropy .",

    "but the dipole perturbations are large - scale , belong to a low - dimensional subspace of phase space and therefore might not be generated spontaneously in practice . in most cases , however , there are other unstable directions and other types of destabilizing perturbations .    in general , if @xmath241 , @xmath242 for @xmath243 and any perturbation in @xmath244 will destabilize the flow , in the grand canonical ensemble . in the microcanonical ensemble",
    ", this remains true when @xmath119 , but only those perturbations which conserve energy and angular momentum at first order remain when @xmath245 .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , the smaller @xmath59 is , the less stable the critical point is .",
    "this source of instability exists in the barotropic case  @xcite and does not depend on whether there is root intertwining or not .",
    "there is a second source of instability which acts when @xmath246 and @xmath202 .",
    "this source of instability becomes more important as there is more root intertwining .",
    "for instance , the dipole critical points obtained for @xmath177 can only be destabilized by dipoles when there is no root intertwining , but it is not so when there is . in cases 2 ( when @xmath90 ) and 4 ( @xmath247 ) , we have @xmath248 , and perturbations in @xmath249 will destabilize the flow ( taking into account the energy and angular momentum conservation if we are working in the microcanonical ensemble ) . in the case @xmath247 , root intertwining occurs at least for @xmath101 large enough .",
    "this means that for @xmath59 small enough , the critical points can be destabilized by arbitrary small scale perturbations .",

    "in the previous sections , we have obtained analytically a class of equilibrium states for two - layer quasi - geostrophic flows characterized by a linear relation between vorticity and stream function .",
    "in addition , we have also obtained all the critical points of the corresponding variational problem , including saddle - points of the variational problem .",
    "we have also constructed the phase diagrams of the system .",
    "note that we restricted ourselves here to the case of a linear vorticity - stream function relation . for 2d flows on the sphere , qi and marston  @xcite have performed a perturbative computation enforcing weakly the constraint fo conservation of the quartic casimir invariant , and obtained that the presence of a weak non - linearity in the vorticity - stream function leads to a sharpening or to a weakening of the vorticity profile in the vortex cores .",
    "we can expect this result to carry over to the two - layer quasi - geostrophic flows considered here ; therefore the repartition of energy between the barotropic and the baroclinic modes at statistical equilibrium should not be too much affected by the presence of a weak non - linearity .",
    "these results indicate that the behavior of the system on the horizontal scales is similar to that of the one - layer ( barotropic ) system .",
    "the phase space is made of two copies of the one - layer phase space ( formally , it is the cartesian product @xmath256 ) .",
    "it is convenient to decompose the phase space in terms of the eigenspaces of the laplace - beltrami operator : @xmath257 , with @xmath258 . in the one - layer case ,",
    "the equilibrium states corresponding to a linear vorticity - stream function relation all lie in @xmath259 ; in other words , the `` final result '' of the inverse cascade is expected to be a complete condensation of the energy in the gravest modes . in the two - layer case considered here ,",
    "all the energy is analogously expected to condense in @xmath260 .",
    "hence , the stratification does not really modify the nonlinear transfers of energy in each layer on the horizontal .",
    "the nonlinear transfers of energy on the vertical direction  which of course is not accounted for at all in a barotropic model  are more complicated .",
    "the standard , phenomenological theory for two - layer quasi - geostrophic turbulence  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is based on the fact that , at large scales ( larger than the radius of deformation ) , the dynamical equation for the barotropic mode resembles that of 2d turbulence , while the dynamics of the baroclinic mode resembles a passive scalar .",
    "hence , one expects a direct cascade of baroclinic energy and an inverse cascade of barotropic energy .",
    "as the forcing in the oceans and in the atmosphere is essentially baroclinic , the traditional picture which emerges is that energy is injected mostly at large scales in the baroclinic mode , cascades downscale until reaching the radius of deformation , where it is in major part transferred to the barotropic mode and cascades upscale until being dissipated by boundary layer friction . note that at large scales , the inverse cascade of barotropic energy can be arrested by the effect of rossby waves , which leads to preferential formation of zonal flows  @xcite .",
    "the energy which is not transferred to the barotropic mode at the deformation scale , and not cascaded upscale in the barotropic mode , is scattered downscale until it reaches the ozmidov scale , where isotropy recovers and turbulence becomes 3d .",
    "statistical mechanics sheds some light on the nonlinear processes which transfer energy from the baroclinic mode to the barotropic mode .",
    "previous studies , based either on the galerkin truncated approach for two - layer flows  @xcite or the mrs approach for continuous stratification  @xcite have stressed that there is a natural tendency for _ barotropization _ of the flow , and that statistical equilibria should be barotropic at large scales .",
    "our results complete this picture by confirming the general tendency towards barotropization and allowing a precise discussion based on the phase diagrams . in the context of the two - layer model ,",
    "it is clear that the conservation of fine - grained enstrophy in each layer will put strong constraints on the extent to which barotropization can be achieved . indeed , purely barotropic flows necessarily have @xmath90 ( because @xmath261 ) . nevertheless , enstrophy is expected to be transferred downscale and even if @xmath247 , it may happen that most of the difference is in fact in the small scales , while the amount of enstrophy in the large scales is roughly the same in the two - layers , thereby allowing for complete barotropization in the large scales .",
    "the mean - field theory used here is precisely concerned not with the fine - scale fields but with coarse - grained ones .",
    "therefore , at a coarse - grained level describing the large scales , it may be that @xmath262 .",
    "our results state that when @xmath90 , the barotropization process reaches its full extent ; i.e. all the statistical equilibria are purely barotropic and no energy remains in the baroclinic mode . when @xmath263 , purely barotropic flows are still attainable at a coarse - grained level due to the mechanism explained above , but purely baroclinic flows",
    "are also possible , and in general the statistical equilibria still contain some baroclinic energy .",
    "the fraction of energy blocked in the baroclinic mode is proportional to @xmath264  but also depends on @xmath59 and @xmath60 of course .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , rotation tends to favor barotropization .",
    "this can be expected based on the remark that as planetary vorticity @xmath265 increases , it becomes the dominant term in total vorticity @xmath56 .",
    "therefore rotation tends to homogenize the vertical distribution of fine - grained enstrophy as well , and increasing @xmath265 decreases the fraction of baroclinic energy at statistical equilibrium .",
    "this can be seen on the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ gcphasediagshear ] ) , where increasing @xmath265 brings the curve of pure baroclinic flows towards the @xmath266 region . as mentioned in  @xcite ,",
    "this effect is probably counter - balanced after a certain threshold by the effect of waves : as @xmath265 increases , the propagation time of rossby waves become smaller , until it becomes comparable to the eddy turnover time at the same scale .",
    "then , we enter a regime dominated by wave dynamics , where the dynamics may not be mixing enough to ensure that the predictions of statistical mechanics will be observed . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been observed in numerical simulations  @xcite that rossby waves break the tendency towards barotropization .    as a summary ,",
    "statistical mechanics predicts that the barotropization process is maximal when starting from a vertically homogeneous ( or nearly so ) fine - grained enstrophy profile , while it is only partial , and can range from zero to maximal , when starting from a vertically sheared fine - grained situation .",
    "these results could be of relevance to better understand the role of balanced modes in vertical mixing in rotating / stratified fluids like the ocean , as opposed to , for instance , mixing induced by internal gravity waves .",
    "in this appendix , we give the elementary proofs that @xmath268 and @xmath214 .",
