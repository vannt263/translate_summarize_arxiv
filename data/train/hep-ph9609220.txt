    "the origin of cp violation has remained an unsolved problem since the discovery of cp violation in k meson system a quarter ago@xcite .",
    "although the observed cp violation in k meson system can be accommodated in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions by virtue of a physical complex phase in the three by three cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( ckm ) @xcite , it is not clear if ckm mechanism is really correct or the only source for cp / t violation @xcite . to verify ckm mechanism",
    "one needs not only the information on k meson mixing and decay but also that from the b meson system or other systems .",
    "the main physical purpose of b factory is to test the ckm mechanism .",
    "however even if ckm is the correct mechanism to describe the cp violation in k and b meson mixing and decay , it is not necessary that the ckm matrix is the only source of cp / t violation in the nature @xcite . as pointed out by weinberg @xcite ,",
    "unless the higgs sector is extremely simple , it would be unnatural for higgs - boson exchange not to contribute to cp / t non - conservation .",
    "ckm matrix may explain the observed cp violation in k meson system and possibly the cp violation in b meson system , while other new sources of cp / t violation may occur everywhere it can .",
    "in fact there are some physical motivations for people to seek the new sources of cp / t violation .",
    "one motivation is from strong cp problem in the sm @xcite .",
    "for most of the scenarios to solve this problem they need more complex vacuum structure and therefore new cp non - conservation origin .",
    "another motivation is from cosmology , most astrophysical investigation shows that the additional sources of cp violation are needed to account for the baryon asymmetry of universe at present @xcite .",
    "the third motivation is from supersymmetry . even in the minimal supersymmetrical standard model ( mssm ) , there are some additional cp non - conservation sources beyond the ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "now the question is at what places the possible new cp / t violation effects may show up and what is the potential to search for those effects . in this work",
    "we are going to study systematically on the possibility to find new cp / t violation effects at tau - charm factory ( tcf ) .",
    "tcf is a very good place to test the sm and search new physics phenomena because of its high luminosity and precision @xcite .",
    "especially the @xmath4 sector is a good place to seek for non - sm cp / t violation effects because in the sm cp violation in lepton sector occurs only at multi loop level and is way below any measurable level in high energy experiments , only non - sm sources of cp / t non - conservation may contribute and another reason is that @xmath4 has abundant decay channels with sizable branching ratio , which can be used to measure cp / t violation .",
    "furthermore , the production - decay sequences of @xmath4 pair by electron - positron annihilation is also favored .",
    "the reason is as the following : ( i ) @xmath4 pair production by electron - positron annihilation is a purely electroweak process and can be perturbatively calculated ; ( ii ) for the unpolarized electron - positron collision , its initial state is cp invariant in the c.m .",
    "frame ; ( iii ) when the electron and/or positron beams are longitudinally polarized , the initial state is still effectively cp even , which presents extra chances to detect possible cp violation . to detect the possible cp / t violation",
    ", one can either compare certain decay properties of @xmath5 with corresponding cp / t conjugations , or measure some cp / t - odd correlation of momentum or spin of the final state particles from @xmath4 pair decay .",
    "these cp / t violating observables can and should be constructed model independently , since normally in non - sm these observables are not well predicted due to the complexity and many free parameters .",
    "the sensitivity of the experimental measurement on the possible cp / t violation is determined by the sensitivity of the measurement on momentum , spin or other physical quantities of the final state particles , from them the physical cp / t violating observables are constructed .",
    "the better one can measure these quantities , the momenta , for example , the smaller the cp violation phase can be reached . in tcf , it is to expect about @xmath6 @xmath4 pair in one year , and the precision of measurement on kinematic parameters at @xmath3 .",
    "the statistical and systematic error can be around or below this level .",
    "therefore generally a cp / t violation phase as small as order of @xmath3 can be reached at tcf @xcite . in a non - sm",
    "the cp / t violating phase may appear in various stages of the process of production - decay chain , @xmath7 .",
    "we sort them in three cases ; ( i ) cp / t violation is generated in the tree level production process , @xmath8 , where x is some new higgs or gauge bosons , cp / t violating phase appears either in the propagator of x or in the coupling to lepton pairs , and the simplest possibility is x being a neutral higgs in two or multi - higgs doublets model . in this case",
    "the size of cp / t violation is proportional to the interference between the x exchange and @xmath9 , z exchange processes .",
    "unfortunately for x being higgs doublet this interference term is proportional to the initial and final states fermion masses @xmath10 as a result of chirality conservation .",
    "this factor along contributes a suppression factor @xmath11 to all cp / t violating observables in this kind of processes at tcf besides other possible suppression factor , like the large mass of x , small coupling between x and leptons .",
    "we conclude that it is hopeless to search for cp non - conservation from the tree - level production process at tcf .",
    "( ii ) cp / t violation is also generated at production stage , but through loop level .",
    "the most hopeful cases are that there may exist large electric or weak dipole moment ( edm or wdm ) for @xmath4 lepton , i.e. there are sizable cp / t violation phase at the vertex @xmath12 .",
    "for this situation the new physical particles beyond sm only appear as virtual particles through loops and the size of cp violation is proportional to edm or wdm and is not suppressed by other factors , so the point is just whether edm or wdm of @xmath4 is large enough to be observed .",
    "generally the lagrangian describing the cp / t violation in @xmath4 pair production related to edm and wdm is @xmath13 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the electromagnetic and weak field tensors .",
    "the momentum transfer at tcf is around 4 gev , and in lep experiments it is around the mass of z boson .",
    "therefore at tcf we expect the contribution from wdm is a factor of @xmath16 smaller than the contribution from edm , if edm and wdm at the same order of the magnitude . on the other hand",
    "the edm term is less important at lep energy . that is the reason why the lep data constrain more strictly on wdm than edm of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we will neglect the wdm contribution from now on in this work .",
    "( iii ) it is possible that the cp / t violation phase is small in the production process but it is relatively large in the @xmath4 pair decay processes . the processes like @xmath4 to neutrino plus light leptons or hadrons through some new bosons exchange at tree level can contribute significantly to cp / t violation observables . obviously in this situation",
    "any cp / t violation effect from loop level is negligible , since any loop effect is at least suppressed by a factor @xmath17 , where m is the mass of some new heavy particles appearing in loops .",
    "this factor is smaller than @xmath18 if m is heavier than about 20 gev .",
    "now let us recall that how one detects cp violation in @xmath19 meson decays : one measures the partial widths for a decay channel and compares it with that for the corresponding cp - conjugate decay process .",
    "underlying such a philosophy is the interference between a cp violating phase and a cp conserving strong interaction phase , i.e. cp violation effect is only manifested in the process with strong final state interaction .",
    "to observe possible non - ckm cp violation effects in tau decays , however , one has to invoke new methodology in the most cases .",
    "the basic reason is that both in production vertex of @xmath4 pair ( edm of @xmath4 ) and in some tau decay channels ( like pure leptonic decay , @xmath20 , @xmath21 decay channels etc . )",
    ", there is no strong interaction phase , caused by hadronic final state interaction , to interfere with possible cp violating phase .",
    "so far some efforts have been made to investigate the cp / t violation effects in tcf .",
    "mainly those work are trying to find various ways to measure possible cp / t violation .",
    "the simple and very useful method is to construct observables which are cp / t - odd operators being made from momenta of final state particles coming from @xmath4 pair decay or polarization vector of the initial electron ( or both electron and positron ) beam @xcite .",
    "these operators can be used very conveniently to test any cp / t violation from either edm of @xmath4 lepton or from the decay of the @xmath4 pair without much model dependence .",
    "some of the operators are constructed by considering the reactions @xmath22 in the laboratory system , where @xmath23 can be identified as a charged particle coming from the @xmath24 decay .",
    "some cp / t - odd operators ( so cpt even , we will not consider cpt - odd operator in this work since it is certainly much smaller violation effect ) can be expressed as following @xcite    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denote the unit momenta . if the initial electron and/or positron beams are polarized , one can construct some more observables making use of the initial polarization vector .",
    "for example a t violating operator @xmath27 can be constructed from the electron polarization vector @xmath28 and momenta of final state particles .",
    "if there exists any sizable cp / t violation from edm of @xmath4 or in @xmath4 pair decay vertex , in principle the experimental expectation values of these operators are nonzero .",
    "for edm of @xmath4 lepton , @xmath29 , the theoretical expectation values of these operators are worked out and expressed only as a function of @xmath29 @xcite . since at tcf the precision of measurement for these operators",
    "are at @xmath3 level , one expects to probe @xmath29 as small as @xmath30 e - cm .",
    "an example is the measurement of @xmath29 or @xmath31 in lep experiment .",
    "expectation value of @xmath32 operator is directly related to @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath33 by the term diag means a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements given above , @xmath34 is the energy at c.m .",
    "the proportional constants @xmath35 depend on the @xmath4 decay modes , but generally this constant is order of one for all the decay models @xcite .",
    "the decay channels , which can be measured in experiments , may be classified as @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 classes , here @xmath39 is the lighter leptons , @xmath40 is charged hadron like @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . very impressively ,",
    "if the initial electron ( or both electron and positron ) is polarized , one may use the polarization asymmetrized distribution .",
    "the distribution is defined as the differential cross section difference between two different polarizations . with this method",
    ", a @xmath29 as small as @xmath2 e - cm can be reached at tcf @xcite , this corresponds to a sensitivity of @xmath44 of cp / t violation . up to now",
    "the best experimental bound on @xmath29 is from lep experimental data , which is used to exclude indirectly the @xmath29 as large as @xmath45 e - cm @xcite , so two order of magnitudes improvement on @xmath29 measurement can be achieved at tcf .    besides the cp / t - odd operator method",
    ", several other useful strategy were proposed to test these violation in @xmath4 decay .",
    "1 ) c. a. nelson and collaborators @xcite investigated systematically the feasibility of using the so - called stage - two spin - correlation functions to detect possible non - ckm cp violation in the tau - pair production - decay sequence and the corresponding cp - conjugate sequence .",
    "the two - variable energy - correlation distribution @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the opening angle between the final @xmath48 and @xmath49 particles , is essentially a kinematic consequence of the tau - pair spin correlation which depends on the dynamics of @xmath50 or @xmath51 amplitude , and of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 amplitudes . by including @xmath54 and @xmath55 which specify the initial electron beam direction relative to the final - state @xmath48 and @xmath49 momentum directions in the c.m .",
    "frame of @xmath56 system , one obtains the so - called beam - referenced stage - two spin - correlation function @xmath57 . for the @xmath51 vertex ,",
    "there are four complex helicity amplitudes .",
    "hence , the beam - referenced stage - two spin - correlation function constructs four distinct tests for possible cp violation in @xmath58 . to illustrate the discovery limit in using the beam - referenced stage - two spin - correlation function , goozovat and",
    "nelson @xcite calculated the ideal statistical errors corresponding to the four tests .",
    "an advantage of detecting cp violation by use of the stage - two spin - correlation function is that the model independence and amplitude significance of the results is manifest .",
    "it is complementary to the greater dynamical information that can be obtained through other approaches , such as from higher - order diagrammatic calculations in the multi - higgs extensions of the sm .",
    "2 ) another strategy to test cp violation in the two - pion channels of tau decay is due to y.s .",
    "tsai @xcite , the basic ingredient of which is to invoke a highly polarized tau - pair .",
    "consider the tau - pair production by electron - positron annihilation near threshold .",
    "if the initial electron and positron beams are polarized longitudinally ( along the same direction ) , the tau - pair will be produced mainly in the @xmath59-wave , resulting in polarizations of @xmath60 both pointing in the same direction as that of the initial beams .",
    "such a polarization is independent of the production angle and the corresponding polarization vector supplies us with an important block to form products with the final particle momenta . by comparing such polarization - vector - momentum products for a specific tau decay channel with those for the corresponding cp - conjugate process",
    ", one can perform a series of tests for possible cp violation effects in the tau decay .",
    "however , it is impossible to detect a cp violation in the @xmath61 decay without violating cpt symmetry . as for the two - pion channel",
    ", the existence of a complex phase due to the hadronic final - state interactions , given by the breit - wigner formula for the @xmath62-wave resonance @xmath42 , enables detecting possible non - ckm violation by measuring asymmetry of @xmath63 without violating the cpt symmetry , where ( @xmath64 is the tau polarization vector and @xmath65 ( i=1,2 ) are the final pion momenta ) . by limiting the weak interaction to be transmitted only by exchange of spin - one and spin-0 particles",
    ", one can know that only the @xmath59-wave part of the amplitude for the exchange of the extra spin-1 particle make contributions to cp violating observables .",
    "a very generic conclusion is that unless two diagrams have different strong interactions phases , one can not observe the existence of weak phase using terms involving @xmath66 .",
    "tsai @xcite also points out that t violation can not be detected in the pure leptonic decay without detecting the polarization of the decay lepton . because it is impossible to construct t - odd operator by the momenta of the initial and final state particles in pure leptonic three body decays .",
    "this also implies that with cpt symmetry , one can not detect cp violation in @xmath4 decay processes with unpolarized @xmath4 . on the other hand , however , with polarized initial electron and positron beams , one can construct t - odd operators using the momenta and polarization vector of @xmath67 and the decay lepton",
    ". therefore polarization of initial electron and positron is very desirable for detecting of cp / t violation at tcf .",
    "3 ) as for the @xmath68 decay , it can proceed either via @xmath69 resonance @xmath43 and the @xmath70 resonance @xmath71 .",
    "choi , hagiwara and tanabashi @xcite investigated the possibility that the large width - mass ratios of these resonances enhance cp - violation effects in the multi - higgs extensions of the sm . to detect possible cp - violation effects ,",
    "these authors compare the differential decay width for the @xmath72 with that for the corresponding cp - conjugate decay process . to optimize the experimental limit , they suggested considering several cp - violating forward - backward asymmetry of differential decay widths , with appropriate real weight functions .",
    "4 ) to probe possible cp - violating effects in the tau decay with @xmath73 or @xmath74 final states , kilian , krner , schilcher and wu @xcite partitioned the final - state phase space into several sectors and constructed some asymmetries of the differential decay widths . as a result , they showed that t - odd triple momentum correlations are connected to certain asymmetries , so their non - vanishing would indicate a possible non - ckm cp violation in the exclusive semileptonic @xmath75three pseudoscalar - meson decays .    with these knowledge and results obtained in the previous papers in mind , now the crucial question , which is also",
    "the motivation of this work , is whether for cp / t violation appearing in edm close to @xmath76 e - cm and cp / t violation effects in @xmath4 decay as @xmath3 are possible values theoretically . if for all possible extensions of the sm , which people can visualize now , with natural parameter choice , these values are much smaller than the theoretically predicted ones , then the effort to search for such small cp / t violation signal at tcf would be not much meaningful , at least from the theoretical point of view . in this paper",
    "we are trying to answer this question by investigating various possible mechanisms for generating large edm of @xmath4 , cp / t violation in @xmath4 decay .",
    "this paper is organized as the following . in section 2",
    "we review the generation of edm of @xmath4 lepton in various popular beyond standard models and stress on what models can produce possible large edm of @xmath4 . following the discussion of edm , in the section 3",
    "we concentrate on cp / t violation effects from @xmath4 decay in the beyond standard models .",
    "the last section is reserved for some further discussion , and the conclusion on the possibility of finding cp / t violation at tcf is given .",
    "edm of the lepton @xmath77 is a dimension-5 operator .",
    "it can only be generated from the loop level .",
    "because this operator changes the chirality of the lepton , it must be proportional to a fermion mass . in the sm edm of lepton",
    "is generated from three loop diagrams and is proportional to lepton mass itself , so @xmath77 is very small @xcite .",
    "however generally @xmath77 can be produced from one loop diagrams in beyond standard model . at one loop level",
    ", the @xmath77 can be expressed as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is some fermion mass , @xmath80 is a large scale from intermediate states in the loops and @xmath81 denotes other couplings .",
    "@xmath82 is a cp / t violation phase . in the following part",
    "we assume maximal cp / t violation phase , i.e. @xmath83 . from this equation one sees that @xmath77 can be at most as large as @xmath84 e - cm if @xmath85 is between @xmath86 . since @xmath80 is a scale around or larger than weak scale , in order to obtain large @xmath77 , @xmath79 must be a large fermion mass such as t quark mass or new heavy fermion masses .",
    "for example if m is the @xmath4 mass then @xmath29 is smaller than @xmath87 e - cm which is not detectable at tcf .",
    "same is true for the scale @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath80 is at tev scale @xmath77 is smaller than @xmath87 e - cm .",
    "although , in principle , @xmath29 is possibly as large as @xmath2e - cm , one has to avoid too large edm of electron @xmath88 at the same time .",
    "current experimental upper limit on @xmath88 is about @xmath89e - cm .",
    "this is a very strong constraint especially when one is expecting large @xmath29 .",
    "so in any beyond standard model , two requirements must be satisfied in order to obtain measurable @xmath29 .",
    "the first one is that the model must provide @xmath29 at one loop level and @xmath29 is not suppressed by a small fermion mass term , the fermion mass term should be a top quark mass , supersymmetric partner of bosons or other exotic fermion masses .",
    "the second one is that the predicted @xmath88 associated with large @xmath29 is below its current experimental bound .",
    "these two conditions altogether exclude most of beyond standard models which can provide large enough @xmath29 observable for tcf .",
    "we will see from the following discussion that many beyond standard models do not satisfy the two requirements .",
    "usually edm of lepton is generated from one loop diagrams in extension of the sm .",
    "1 is a typical one loop diagram for the lepton edm .",
    "the virtual particles are scalar or vector boson @xmath59 and fermion @xmath90 in the loop .",
    "photon is attached to the charged intermediate particles .",
    "the @xmath77 from this diagram is approximately proportional to the fermion mass @xmath79 and it is divided by a scale @xmath80 , which is larger or equal to @xmath79 . besides , there are two more couplings at the vertex @xmath91 . in a practical model",
    "there could be many possible virtual bosons and fermions in the loop , but we only consider the dominant contribution here as an order of magnitude estimation .",
    "the diagram in fig . 1 is evaluated as @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes three generation leptons and",
    "@xmath94 is the electric charge of the virtual particles .",
    "@xmath95 is an order of one factor from the loop integral .",
    "( 7 ) is true up to a factor of order one",
    ". and there should be a logarithmic dependence on @xmath96 in @xmath95 , which is slowly varying .    in order to obtain measurable @xmath29 and avoid too large @xmath88",
    ", one needs a large @xmath79 as discussed before and @xmath81 , @xmath97 must be around order of one for @xmath4 but much small ( smaller than about @xmath3 ) for electron .",
    "we systematically investigate and review most of the popular extensions of the standard model and point out that the following type of models can fulfill the requirements .",
    "* scalar leptoquark models*@xcite 0.5 cm cp violation effect in @xmath0 sector for the models are recently discussed extensively by some authors @xcite .",
    "it is particularly interesting for generating a large @xmath77 .",
    "these are the models which do not need to introduce additional fermion .",
    "because the top quark mass is large , it is possible to generate a large @xmath98 through coupling of @xmath0 , top quark and the corresponding leptoquark .",

    ", we would like to point out here , though they have some new sources of cp / t violation , they can not offer a observable @xmath29 at tcf .",
    "these include multi - higgs doublet model ( including two higgs doublet model ) @xcite , left - right symmetric model @xcite , mirror fermion model @xcite and universal soft breaking susy model @xcite etc . in multi - higgs doublet model electron @xcite and neutron @xcite",
    "may obtain a large edm close to current experimental bounds through two loop diagrams , but @xmath29 generated in the model is quite below the tcf observable value .",
    "the reason is that @xmath29 is proportional @xmath167 , but not a large fermion mass .",
    "we estimate @xmath168e - cm @xcite that in this model . for left - right symmetric model , nieves , chang and pal @xcite find that the upper bound for @xmath29 is @xmath169e - cm .",
    "it is the right- or left - handed gauge boson in the loop as the role of @xmath59 particle , while right - handed neutrino is the virtual fermion particle in the loop .",
    "@xmath29 in this model is proportional to left- and right - handed gauge boson mixing angle .",
    "though it is not suppressed by the small fermion mass ( @xmath79 is a large right - handed neutrino mass ) , the mixing angle is constrained to be smaller than @xmath170 @xcite from purely non - leptonic strange decays .",
    "it leads to about three order of magnitude suppression . in the mirror fermion model ,",
    "standard gauge bosons couple to ordinary lepton and the mirror lepton with a mixing angle .",
    "it is @xmath171 and @xmath172 bosons in the one loop diagrams , the heavy fermion line is the mirror lepton .",
    "however the mixing angle in this model is constrained by various experiments @xcite , and most stringently by lep data on @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "the constraint from lep data on the mixing angle is less than about 0.3 .",
    "the resulting bound is @xmath174e - cm , which is a few times smaller than tcf measurable value . as we have mentioned above in the universal soft breaking susy model , @xmath175e - cm due to the constraint on @xmath88 . the only alternative situation is discussed above on generic mssm in this section .",
    "as we have pointed out in the introduction , cp / t violation effects in @xmath4 decays , if observed , must occur at tree level diagrams .",
    "that is the interference between the sm @xmath4 decay processes and new tree level processes of @xmath4 decays , in which cp / t violation phases appear at the interaction vertexes , provides the information of cp / t violation in the @xmath4 sector .",
    "feynman diagrams of these processes can be shown as in the fig .",
    "2 , where @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 are light fermions . x is a new particle ( scalar or vector boson ) which mediates cp / t violating interaction .",
    "the size of cp / t violation is always proportional to the interference of the tree level diagrams .",
    "we denote the amplitudes for these diagrams as @xmath179 for w boson exchange diagram , @xmath180 for other x boson exchange diagrams .",
    "the size of cp / t violation in the @xmath4 decay can be characterized by a dimensionless quantity @xmath181 practically physical quantity expectation values which are used to reflect cp / t violation , like the expectation values of cp / t - odd operators , difference of a partial decay widths of a @xmath5 decay channel and its conjugate @xmath182 decay channel , are model dependent and generally quite complicate .",
    "it needs the detailed information of the new physics model and a lot of parameters enter into the expression .",
    "this makes it a very much involved work to write down these quantities in a specific model beyond the sm . and",
    "the exact cp / t violation quantity expression written down from a model should be different from the @xmath183 defined above .",
    "however as a simple and reasonable estimation , the quantity @xmath183 in eq .",
    "( 11 ) can be used as an indication of how large of cp / t violation may happen at various @xmath4 decays . moreover , the amplitude @xmath180 is usually much smaller than @xmath179 because so far all the experimental data agree with the sm prediction very well .",
    "so @xmath180 term in the denominator can be neglected . using @xmath179 as the amplitude from w boson exchange and @xmath180 from the new boson x exchange",
    ", we estimate its size , @xmath184 here @xmath185 is fermi constant and @xmath85 , @xmath186 are couplings in @xmath180 . from eq .",
    "( 12 ) one sees that the size of cp / t violation is determined by the parameter @xmath187 . for different models , this parameter is constrained by some other physical processes .",
    "so the possible size of cp / t violation depends on the parameter region which is restricted in a specific model .    in fig .",
    "2 the final state fermions can be a pair of leptons and quarks besides @xmath188 .",
    "it corresponds to pure leptonic and hadronic decays respectively . at the quark level ,",
    "the diagrams with a pair of quarks in the final states denote an inclusive process , it includes all possible hadronic channels originated from quark pair hadronization .",
    "some of the useful hadronic final states like @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 can be used to measure the properties of @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is often difficult to make a reliable quantitative prediction for cp / t violation in exclusive hadronic decay modes , because of the uncertainty in the hadronic matrix elements . on the other hand , for the inclusive cases",
    ", one may make a more reliable quantitative estimation due to the fact that one has no need to deal with the hadronization of quarks in this case .",
    "in addition , qcd correction should not change the order of the tree level diagram evaluation as the energy scale for @xmath4 decay processes is around 1gev . in this section",
    "we only deal with the diagrams containing quark pair inclusively , so the cp / t violation size we estimate below is for all the possible hadronic decay channels . in the last section we will comment on our results in exclusive processes . because of the scale of @xmath4 mass , its decay products can only be neutrino , electron , muon and hadrons containing only light u , d , s quarks as other heavy quarks are kinematically forbidden .",
    "therefore there are not many possibilities for x particle being the candidate for mediating cp / t violation in the fig .",
    "2 . in fact",
    "all the possible choices are the following : x being leptoquark , charged higgs singlet , doublet and triplet , and double charged singlet .",
    "now we come to discuss these different cases separately .    * scalar leptoquark models * at tree level it is obvious that only @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath194 contribute to @xmath4 decays .",
    "there are two type of decay processes at quark level , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the @xmath183 parameter is determined by @xmath197 and @xmath198 for these two type of decays respectively in model 1 and 2 in eq .",
    "( 8) . for model 5",
    "there is cp / t violation effect only in the second type process , which is determined by @xmath199 .",
    "a direct constraint on these parameters can be obtained through comparing the theoretical value @xmath200 gev and the measurement value of @xmath201 gev @xcite .",
    "assuming that real and imaginary part of the coupling @xmath202 are approximately equal , one has from @xmath203 @xcite @xmath204 at @xmath205 level for model one and two . and from @xmath206 a similar result can be obtained for all the three models . using the theoretical value @xmath207 gev @xcite and the measurement value @xmath208 gev for the @xmath209 decay width",
    "we obtain @xmath210 at @xmath205 level .",
    "this constraint is less stringent due to the large uncertainties in @xmath211 . with these constraints ,",
    "one estimates the upper bound of @xmath183 value for the two type of processes as @xmath212 and @xmath213 where @xmath214 is cabibbo angle .",
    "@xmath215 is proportional to @xmath216 and is smaller than @xmath217 because this process is cabibbo suppressed , even though the coupling is less constrained than that of cabibbo unsuppressed process . from this estimation",
    "we expect cp / t violation in these models could be large enough for tcf or in the other words tcf data can put stronger direct restriction on the parameters of the model .",
    "however , if one assumes that all the couplings @xmath81 and @xmath97 are at the same size irrespective of the generation indexes , then much more stringent bounds exist .",
    "these bounds are obtained from experimental bounds of @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 @xcite .",
    "they are generally about five order of magnitude smaller than the direct bounds .",
    "therefore the size of cp / t violation is @xmath222 which is far below the capability of tcf .",
    "* multi - higgs doublet models ( mhd ) * with the natural suppression of flavor changing neutral current , it is necessary to have more than two higgs doublets , so that there are at least two physical charged higgs particles .",
    "cp / t violation may generally happen through the mixing of these charged higgs particles .",
    "we consider a multi - higgs doublet model , say , n higgs doublets . in this model",
    "there are 2(n-1 ) charged and ( 2n-1 ) neutral physical scalars . since only the yukawa interactions of the charged scalars with fermions are relevant for our purpose .",
    "following grossman @xcite we write down the yukawa interactions in fermion mass eigenstates as @xmath223h_i^{+}+h.c . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 denote the diagonal mass matrices of up - type quarks , down type quarks and charged leptons respectively .",
    "@xmath80 is km matrix .",
    "@xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath171 are complex couplings which arise from the mixing of the charged scalars and cp / t violation in @xmath4 decay processes is due to these couplings .",
    "how large is the @xmath183 for various @xmath4 decay channels depends on the values of these parameters .",
    "more precisely , in the pure leptonic decays the size of cp / t violation is determined by @xmath229 with @xmath230 and in hadronic decays it is determined by @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "the three combinations of parameters are constrained by various experiments @xcite .",
    "the strongest constraint on @xmath171 is from @xmath233 universality in @xmath4 decay , which gives @xmath234gev@xmath235 for higgs mass @xmath236 around 100gev .",
    "@xmath237 is bounded from above from the measurement of the branching ratio @xmath238 , @xmath239gev@xmath240 if @xmath241 gev .",
    "finally a upper bound is given as @xmath242 from the experimental data of the process @xmath243this bound is obtained for t quark mass at 140 gev @xcite and @xmath244gev , however for a different @xmath236 , say 100gev , this bound is expected not to change much . with these bounds we can estimate cp / t violation size of @xmath4 leptonic and hadronic decays . for the leptonic decay @xmath245",
    ", we have the quantity @xmath246 here the additional factor @xmath247 comes from the interference of left- and right - handed muon lines in the final states .",
    "so we expect that cp / t violation effect in the process @xmath248 is suppressed by a factor @xmath249 and is negligible . for the hadronic decay @xmath250 we have @xmath251 with the current @xmath252 quark mass @xmath253 mev and the dynamical @xmath252 quark mass @xmath254 mev . for hadronic decay @xmath255 similar result",
    "is obtained @xmath256 here we use current and dynamical @xmath257 quark masses as 150 mev and 400 mev respectively . in summary , in multi - higgs doublet model cp / t violation effect is possibly as large as order of @xmath3 for exclusive hadronic decays and it could be even close to @xmath258 in pure leptonic decay to @xmath158 and neutrinos .    *",
    "other extensions of the sm for pure leptonic decays * besides leptoquark and higgs doublet , there are three other kind of scalars which can couple to leptons .",
    "we denote @xmath39 as a lepton doublet and @xmath259 as a singlet lepton .",
    "two @xmath39 can combine to a charged singlet or a triplet .",
    "two @xmath260 can combine to a double charged singlet .",
    "corresponding to these three cases one can introduce a charged singlet scalar @xmath261 , triplet scalar @xmath262 and double charged scalar @xmath263 .",
    "however @xmath263 only induce a lepton family- number - violating process @xmath264 .",
    "there is no diagram corresponding sm contribution , so there is no cp / t violation mediated by this particle . also the branching ratio ( @xmath265 ) for this decay is much smaller than tcf reachable cp / t violation precision @xmath3 . in principle",
    "if there exists more than one @xmath40 or @xmath262 , cp / t violation can be induced by the interference of the w exchange diagram and @xmath40 or @xmath262 exchange diagram in the process @xmath266 with @xmath267 .",
    "now let us discuss these two possibilities in details .",
    "we can write down the new interaction terms which couple the new scalar particles to leptons as the following @xmath268 @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the dirac charge conjugation matrix and @xmath271 is antisymmetric , @xmath272 is symmetric due to fermi statistics .",
    "parameter for these singlet and triplet models are given by , @xmath273 in singlet model and @xmath274 in triplet model respectively .",
    "for the singlet model we assume that @xmath275 is considerably smaller than @xmath276 , so that one does not need to readjust the fermi constant @xmath185 .",
    "this assumption is also consistent with the constraint set by universality between @xmath277 and @xmath158 decay @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath278 is constrained only by the measurement of @xmath4 leptonic decays . at @xmath205 level ( which is about @xmath279% precision )",
    "we estimate approximately @xmath280 gev@xmath240 @xcite .",
    "it implies that @xmath281 with @xmath282 gev .",
    "therefore in this model there is a possibility that cp / t violation effect may show up with a size reachable at tcf in pure leptonic decay channels .    for the triplet model",
    "the direct constraint is also from the measurement of pure leptonic decays .",
    "the same result is obtained as that in the singlet model , i.e. @xmath283 gev@xmath240 . as the result of this constraint one has @xmath284 with @xmath285 gev . however , in this model the new interactions will induce lepton family number violating decay @xmath264 and @xmath286 through exchange of the double charged scalar particle @xmath287 . without seeing any signal ,",
    "one obtains some approximate bounds on the coupling constants as the following @xcite @xmath288 and @xmath289 for @xmath285 gev .",
    "if one assumes that all the couplings @xmath272 are at the same order of magnitude , then these bounds will restrict the cp / t violation size far below the ability of tcf .",
    "again we see some hierarchies on the couplings are needed for this model to give rise observable cp / t violation effects .",
    "additionally in the triplet model one has to avoid the restriction from neutrino mass generation @xcite .",
    "if neutrino develops a mass at tree level , either the couplings or the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the triplet @xmath290 are extremely small . the natural way to deal with this problem is to impose some symmetry on this model .",
    "an example is to introduce a discrete symmetry : @xmath291 with this symmetry , @xmath290 will never develop a nonzero vacuum expectation value , therefore the couplings are not constrained by the neutrino mass generation .",
    "in this work we systematically investigate the possibility of finding cp / t violation in the @xmath4 sector with tcf .",
    "the origin of cp / t violation is from the extensions of the sm .",
    "we discuss most of the popular beyond the sm and present the models which may give rise large cp / t violation in @xmath4 sector through either edm or decay of @xmath4 lepton . before making our conclusion ,",
    "some interesting points should be further discussed or emphasized .",
    "( 1 ) polarization of initial electron and/or positron is very desired for our purpose .",
    "first with polarization the precision of measurement of edm will be increased by about two order of magnitude , as @xmath2e - cm , which is used through this work . without polarization , from our above discussion",
    "one sees that we have no hope to expect a detectable edm of @xmath4 at tcf .",
    "secondly in some decay channels without final state interaction , like pure leptonic decays and two body decays @xmath292 etc . , polarization is needed to search for cp / t violation occurring at @xmath67 decay vertex .",
    "with unpolarized electron and positron beams the cp / t violation could only be detected using channels with final state interaction phase , like @xmath293 etc .",
    "( 2 ) for the hadronic decay we only consider inclusive processes .",
    "the advantage of inclusive process is that one does not need not to consider the hadronization of quarks , which may bring in large uncertainties in the estimation . and the event number in inclusive process is larger than that in certain exclusive processes . however we should mention that for certain exclusive decays the cp / t violation parameter @xmath183 can be larger than that in inclusive decay .",
    "one example is from the multi - higgs double model .",
    "we estimate that @xmath294 for the decay @xmath295 . here",
    "we may also consider the exclusive decay @xmath296 contributed by @xmath43 and @xmath71 resonances .",
    "compared to inclusive decay , the @xmath183 parameter is larger by a factor of ( using current algebra relation ) @xmath297 so @xmath298 is obtained .",
    "however on the other hand the event number decreases by a factor of @xmath299 here @xmath300 gev is used .",
    "therefore statistical error increases by about 10 times . in the other words the measurement precision at tcf for this channel is about @xmath258 . as the result , at",
    "@xmath205 level @xmath301 is observable .",
    "this estimation agrees with the exact result of reference @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) obviously the numerical result we obtained above is quite crude .",
    "more accurate estimation is necessary in the future .",
    "for instance through this paper we assume that edm as large as @xmath2e - cm and @xmath183 as large as @xmath3 can be observed .",
    "this of course is a rough estimation . to be more precise ,",
    "monte carlo simulation is needed , which will tell us more confidently how large cp / t violation is able to be observed at tcf .",
    "especially the monte carlo simulation on edm of @xmath4 will give us a quite clear result , because in this case the @xmath29 is the only parameter we should take care .",
    "all the model dependence is included in it . recently",
    "a group of people analyzed the data from bepc experiments to set bound on the t - violating effect for @xmath0 system @xcite .",
    "following the suggestion by t.d .",
    "lee , they considered the pure leptonic @xmath302 decays to @xmath303 plus neutrinos in the final states . the t - violating amplitude @xmath304 is measured , where @xmath305 is the unit momentum vector of the initial electron beam , @xmath306 and @xmath307 are the unit momenta of the final state electron and muon respectively .",
    "totally 251 events are analyzed and it results in @xmath308 this result agrees with no t - violation as expected from our previous discussion on pure leptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "( 4 ) in order to generate detectable large cp / t violation effects , we know from our investigation that there must exist new physics and the new physics scale is not far above the weak scale",
    ". therefore if there is a observable cp / t violation effect in @xmath4 sector at tcf , the associated new physics phenomena should be observed at high energy experiments , like lhc and lep ii experiments .",
    "it is interesting to see if the new particles predicted by the various models we have discussed in this paper are indeed detectable in these high energy experiments .",
    "( 5 ) precise measurement of the pure leptonic decay is another way to test the new physics responsible for cp / t violation . since if there is cp / t violation effect at level of @xmath3 , the @xmath4 leptonic decay width must deviate from the sm prediction at the same level .",
    "so we expect to observe the deviation by measuring the branching ratio of the pure leptonic decay .",
    "however it is not true _ vice versa _ , since a deviation of leptonic branching ratio from that of the sm does not necessarily indicate cp / t violation .",
    "finally we come to our conclusion .",
    "there exists the possibility that cp / t violation in @xmath4 sector is large enough to be discovered at tcf , although for this large violation effect some specific new physics phenomena beyond the sm are needed and the parameter spaces of the models are strongly restricted .",
