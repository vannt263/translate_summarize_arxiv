    "all the fundamental laws of physics are now understood in geometrical terms .",
    "the classical geometry that plays a fundamental role in our formulation of these laws has been vastly extended in noncommutative geometry @xcite .",
    "however , we still have very little insight into the origins of spacetime geometry itself .",
    "this situation has been undergoing a significant evolution in recent years and it now seems possible to understand geometry as an emergent concept . the notion of geometry as an emergent concept is not new ,",
    "see for example @xcite for an inspiring discussion and @xcite for some recent ideas .",
    "we examine such a phenomenon in the context of a simple three matrix model @xcite .",
    "matrix models with a background noncommutative geometry have received attention as an alternative setting for the regularization of field theories @xcite and as the configurations of @xmath3 branes in string theory @xcite . in the model studied here ,",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "it has no background geometry in the high temperature phase and the geometry itself emerges as the system cools , much as a bose condensate or superfluid emerges as a collective phenomenon at low temperatures .",
    "the simplicity of the model we study here allows for a detailed examination of such an exotic transition .",
    "we suspect the characteristic features of the transition may be generic to this novel phenomenon .    in this article",
    "we study both theoretically and numerically a three matrix model with global @xmath4 symmetry whose energy functional or euclidean action functional ( see eq .",
    "( [ action - simpleform ] ) ) is a single trace of a quartic polynomial in the matrices @xmath5 .",
    "the model contains three parameters , the inverse temperature @xmath6 , and parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 which provide coefficients for the quartic and quadratic terms in the potential .",
    "we find that as the parameters are varied the model has a phase transition with two clearly distinct phases , one _ geometrical _ the other a _ matrix phase_. small fluctuations in the _ geometrical phase _ are those of a yang - mills and a scalar field around a ground state corresponding to a round two - sphere . in the _ matrix phase _",
    "there is no background spacetime geometry and the fluctuations are those of the matrix entries around zero . in this article",
    "we focus on the subset of parameter space where in the large matrix limit the gauge group is abelian .    for finite but large @xmath9 , at low temperature , the model exhibits fluctuations around a fuzzy sphere @xcite . in the infinite @xmath9 limit",
    "the macroscopic geometry becomes classical .",
    "as the temperature is increased it undergoes a transition with latent heat so the entropy jumps , yet the model has critical fluctuations and a divergent specific heat . as this critical coupling",
    "is approached the fuzzy sphere radius expands to a critical radius and the sphere evaporates .",
    "the neighbourhood of the critical point exhibits all the standard symptoms of a continuous 2nd order transition , such as large scale fluctuations , critical slowing down ( of the monte carlo routine ) and is characterized by a specific heat exponent which we argue is @xmath10 , a value consistent with our numerical simulations . in the high temperature ( strong coupling ) phase the model is a matrix model closely related to zero dimensional yang - mills theory . as the transition",
    "is approached from within this phase we find no evidence of critical fluctuations and no divergence in the specific heat .    in the _ geometrical sphere _ phase the gauge coupling constant is @xmath11 and @xmath7 parameterizes the mass of the scalar field . for small @xmath12",
    "we find a transition with discontinuous internal energy @xmath13 ( so the entropy jumps across the transition @xcite ) while the specific heat is divergent as the transition is approached from the low temperature fuzzy sphere phase but finite when approached from the high temperature _ matrix phase_. the fuzzy sphere emerges as the low temperature ground state which as one expects is the low entropy phase and the transition is characterized by both a latent heat and divergent fluctuations .    to our knowledge",
    "it is the first clear example of a transition where the spacetime geometry is emergent .",
    "this transition itself is extremely unusual .",
    "we know of no other physical situation that has a transition with these features .",
    "standard transitions are very dependent on the dimension of the background spacetime and when this is itself in transition an asymmetry of the approach to criticality is not so surprising .    by studying the eigenvalues of operators in the theory we establish that , in the matrix phase , the matrices @xmath5 are characterised by continuous eigenvalue distributions which undergo a transition to a point spectrum characteristic of the fuzzy sphere phase as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the point spectrum is consistent with @xmath14 where @xmath15 are @xmath16 angular momentum generators in the irreducible representation given by the matrix size and @xmath17 is the radius of the fuzzy sphere .",
    "the full model received an initial study in @xcite while a simpler version , invariant under translations of @xmath5 , arises naturally as the configuration of @xmath3 branes in the large @xmath18 limit of a boundary wess - zumino - novikov - witten model @xcite and has been studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "if the mass parameters of the potential are related to the matrix size , the model becomes that introduced in @xcite .",
    "the interpretation presented here is novel , as are the results on the entropy and critical behaviour and the extension to the full model .",
    "a short description of the results obtained in this article is given in @xcite .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section",
    "@xmath19 we review the fuzzy sphere and its geometry . in section @xmath20 we derive several theoretical predictions in the fuzzy sphere phase including the critical behaviour of the model . in section @xmath21 we discuss the non - perturbative phase structure ( phase diagram ) and monte carlo numerical results for various observables .",
    "we conclude in section @xmath22 with some discussion and speculations .",
    "the ordinary round unit sphere , @xmath23 , can be defined as the two dimensional surface embedded in flat three dimensional space satisfying the equation @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "one can use the @xmath26 as a nonholonomic coordinate system for the sphere . in this coordinate system a general function can be expanded as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the standard spherical harmonics .",
    "the basic derivations are provided by the @xmath4 generators defined by @xmath29 and the laplacian is @xmath30 with eigenvalues @xmath31 , @xmath32 . following frhlich and gawdzki @xcite ( or connes @xcite for spin geometry )",
    "the geometry of a riemannian manifold can be encoded in a spectral triple . for the ordinary sphere",
    "the triple is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the algebra of all functions @xmath35 on the sphere and @xmath36 is the infinite dimensional hilbert space of square integrable functions .",
    "such a spectral triple is precisely the data that enters the scalar field action on the manifold .",
    "so a scalar field action which includes an appropriate laplacian can specify the geometry .",
    "the fuzzy sphere can be viewed as a particular deformation of the above triple which is based on the fact that the sphere is the coadjoint orbit @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 and is therefore a symplectic manifold which can be quantized in a canonical fashion by simply quantizing the volume form @xmath39 the result of this quantization is to replace the algebra @xmath40 by the algebra of @xmath41 matrices @xmath42 .",

    "it is not difficult to convince ourselves that this laplacain has a cut - off spectrum with eigenvalues @xmath31 where @xmath64 . given the above discussion we see that a general fuzzy function ( or element of the algebra ) on @xmath55 can be expanded in terms of polarization tensors as follows @xmath65 . the continuum limit is given by @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the fuzzy sphere can be described as a sequence of triples @xmath67 with a well defined limit given by the triple @xmath33 .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in the function algebra of @xmath68 is @xmath69 and the noncommutativity parameter is @xmath70 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the differential calculus on the fuzzy sphere is three dimensional and as a consequence , treating gauge fields as one - forms , a generic gauge field , @xmath71 has @xmath20 components .",
    "each component @xmath72 , @xmath73 , is an element of @xmath60 and the @xmath0 gauge symmetry of the commutative sphere will become a @xmath74 gauge symmetry on the fuzzy sphere with gauge transformations implemented as @xmath75 $ ] where @xmath76 . in this approach to gauge fields on the fuzzy sphere , @xmath68 , it is difficult to split the vector field @xmath71 in a gauge - covariant fashion into a tangent gauge field and a normal scalar field .",

    "the limit @xmath93 gives a large mass to the scalar component and effectively projects it out of the spectrum of small fluctuations .",

    "we will primarily be interested in the case with @xmath100 .",
    "we see also that the presence of the scalar field means that the geometry is completely specified , in that all the ingredients of the spectral triple are supplied by this field .",

    "we have studied the simple three matrix model with euclidean action functional ( [ action - simpleform ] ) for general values of its parameters @xmath360 and @xmath7 but focused on a small range of the possible values of the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "we find the model to have two clearly distinct phases . in the high temperature regime (",
    "i.e. small @xmath183 ) the model has a disordered phase . in this phase the eigenvalues distribution of an individual matrix is well approximated by the one - cut distribution of a hermitian matrix model with quartic potential .",
    "we call this phase the _ matrix phase _ of the model . at low temperature",
    "the model has an ordered phase .",
    "the order is unusual in that it describes the condensation of a background geometry as a collective order of the matrix degrees of freedom .",
    "we call this the _ geometrical _ or _ fuzzy sphere phase _ , since for finite matrix size the ground state is described by a fuzzy sphere which is a quantized version of the classical sphere . in the large matrix size",
    "limit the sphere becomes classical but at a microscopic level the geometry always has a noncommutative character as can be seen from the spectrum of the `` coordinate functions '' which are proportional to the @xmath16 generator @xmath329 in the irreducible representation of dimension given by the matrix size .    in the geometrical phase small fluctuations are those of a @xmath0 gauge field and a neutral scalar field fluctuating on a round two sphere .",
    "the two fields have non - trivial mixing at the quadratic level but are otherwise not interacting . in this phase , with @xmath164 , the parameter @xmath12 parameterizes the mass of the scalar fluctuation , otherwise for @xmath361 , the parameter @xmath111 provides a constant external current for the scalar field .",
    "for @xmath362 the transition between the two phases is found to be discontinuous .",
    "there is a jump in the internal energy ( expectation of the euclidean action ) and from a theoretical analysis ( valid in the fuzzy sphere phase ) we find the entropy drops by @xmath363 per degree of freedom @xcite as one crosses from the high temperature matrix phase to the geometrical one .",
    "our theoretical results also predict that : for all @xmath7 and @xmath364 , the model has divergent critical fluctuations in the specific heat characterised by the critical exponent @xmath10 .",
    "the critical regime narrows as the critical temperature decreases and the transition temperature is sent to zero at @xmath365 and so there is no geometrical phase beyond this point .",
    "our numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with these theoretical predictions and we find the critical fluctuations are only present in the fuzzy sphere phase so that the transition has an asymmetrical character .",
    "we know of no other physical setting that exhibits transitions of the type presented here and further numerical and theoretical study are needed .",
    "however , the thermodynamic properties of the transition are similar to those found in the @xmath366vertex model and the dimer model @xcite .",
    "we focus simulations on @xmath164 and observe that the discontinuity in the entropy ( or the latent heat ) decreases as @xmath12 is increased with the jump vanishing for sufficiently large @xmath7 .",
    "we have not been able to determine with precision where the transition becomes continuous , however the jump in the entropy becomes too small to measure beyond @xmath367 .",
    "also , the predicted critical fluctuations are not seen in the numerical results for large @xmath12 .    the data for the critical point coupling , from our different methods of estimating it , separate in the parameter range where the latent heat disappears indicating a possible multi - critical point or richer structure .",
    "for larger values of @xmath368 we have not been able to resolve the nature of the transition .",
    "the numerical evidence shows the structure of a 3rd order transition , a behaviour typical of many matrix models , however , the fact that @xmath369 , the crossing point of the average action curves for different @xmath9 , still reliably predicts the transition line , suggests the transition is continuous with asymmetric critical fluctuations , consistent with the theoretical analysis .",
    "our conclusion is that the full model has the qualitative features of the model with @xmath362 ( model @xmath370 of eq .",
    "( [ action - s0 ] ) ) and that the effect of the potential is to shift the transition temperature and provide a non - trivial background specific heat .",
    "the divergence of the specific heat arises from the interplay of the chern - simons and yang - mills terms .",
    "given that this competition leads to a divergent specific heat , we expect , sufficiently close to the transition , to see the effect of this competition emerge and the specific heat to eventually rise above the background provided by the potential and diverge as the critical point .",
    "the model of emergent geometry described here , though reminiscent of the random matrix approach to two dimensional gravity @xcite is in fact very different .",
    "the manner in which spacetime emerges is also different from that envisaged in string pictures where continuous eigenvalue distributions @xcite or a liouville mode @xcite give rise to extra dimensions .",
    "it is closely connected to the @xmath3 brane scenario described in @xcite and the @xmath113 version is a dimensionally reduced version of a boundary wznw models in the large @xmath18 limit @xcite . a two matrix model where the large @xmath9 limit describes a hemispherical geometry was studied in @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to invent higher dimensional models with essentially similar phenomenology to that presented here ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for example any complex projective space @xmath371 can emerge from pure matrix dynamics by choosing similar matrix models with appropriate potentials @xcite .",
    "_ in summary _",
    ", we have found an exotic transition in a simple three matrix model .",
    "the nature of the transition is very different if approached from high or low temperatures .",
    "the high temperature phase is described by three decoupled random matrices with self interaction so there is no background spacetime geometry .",
    "as the system cools a geometrical phase condenses and at sufficiently low temperatures the system is described by small fluctuations of a @xmath0 gauge field coupled to a massive scalar field .",
    "the critical temperature is pushed upwards as the scalar field mass is increased .",
    "once the geometrical phase is well established the specific heat takes the value @xmath1 with the gauge and scalar fields each contributing @xmath2 .",
    "we believe that this scenario gives an appealing picture of how a geometrical phase might emerge as the system cools and suggests a very novel scenario for the emergence of geometry in the early universe .",
    "in such a scenario the temperature can be viewed as an effect of other degrees of freedom present in a more realistic model but not directly participating in the transition we describe . in the model",
    "described in detail above , both the geometry and the fields are emergent dynamical concepts as the system cools .",
    "once the geometry is well established the background scalar decouples from the rest of the physics and is always massive .",

    "<S> we present , theoretical predictions and monte carlo simulations , for a simple three matrix model that exhibits an exotic phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the transition is very different if approached from the high or low temperature side . </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature phase is described by three self interacting random matrices with no background spacetime geometry . </S>",
    "<S> as the system cools there is a phase transition in which a classical two - sphere condenses to form the background geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the transition has an entropy jump or latent heat , yet the specific heat diverges as the transition is approached from low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we find no divergence or evidence of critical fluctuations when the transition is approached from the high temperature phase . at sufficiently low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the system is described by small fluctuations , on a background classical two - sphere , of a @xmath0 gauge field coupled to a massive scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperature is pushed upwards as the scalar field mass is increased . </S>",
    "<S> once the geometrical phase is well established the specific heat takes the value @xmath1 with the gauge and scalar fields each contributing @xmath2 .    _ </S>",
