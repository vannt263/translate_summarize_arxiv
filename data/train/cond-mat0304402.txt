    "phase locking phenomena are found in a wide variety of nonlinear driven systems in condensed matter physics.@xcite it takes place when an internal frequency of the system locks to a rational multiple of the frequency of an external ac - drive .",
    "a simple example of this is the case of an overdamped particle moving in a tilted washboard potential , where the frequency of motion of the particle over the periodic potential can be locked to multiples of the frequency of a superimposed ac force for a finite range of the dc force ( tilt of the washboard ) . since the internal ( washboard ) frequency is proportional to the mean velocity of the particle , phase locking results in a constant mean velocity for a certain range of dc - force curve when the interference condition is satisfied .",
    "a particularly well known realization of this effect is shapiro steps@xcite in the dc current - voltage ( @xmath0 ) characteristics of a single small area josephson junction driven by a time periodic current . within the washboard analogy outlined above",
    ", a simple analysis provides expressions for the appearance of shapiro steps at specific voltages @xcite corresponding to integer multiples of the driving frequency",
    ".    driven systems with many degrees of freedom can also exhibit phase locking .",
    "this has attracted broad scientific and technological interest since phase - locking in complex systems can either be induced by collective effects , providing for a low dimensional interpretation of the phenomenon , or itself induce collective ( low dimensional ) behavior in the complex system .",
    "phase - locking experiments have provided information about such dynamical response of non - equilibrium collective states , where dimensionality , thermal fluctuations , quenched disorder , and the magnitude of external fields can be very relevant .",
    "a particular well known example is the large josephson junction array ( jja ) , with @xmath1 junctions , driven by an external current @xmath2 with frequency @xmath3 and with an applied magnetic field density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the magnetic field , @xmath6 the lattice period of the josephson array and @xmath7 the quantum of flux .",
    "_ giant _ shapiro steps at voltages @xmath8 , @xmath9 being an integer , have been observed experimentally in zero magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "fractional giant _",
    "shapiro steps at voltages @xmath11 , were observed experimentally @xcite for strongly commensurate magnetic fields , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 integers , and extensively investigated in numerical simulations.@xcite also , _ subharmonic _",
    "giant shapiro steps at voltages @xmath14 were observed experimentally @xcite for zero magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) , and attributed to the nucleation of complex collective dynamical states @xcite induced by disorder or inductance effects .",
    "shapiro - like phase - locking is also observed in the case of driven vortex lattices in bulk superconductors with two - dimensional periodic pinning arrays , as recently reported both experimentally @xcite and theoretically.@xcite also superconductors , where vortices are driven over a one - dimensional potential generated by thickness modulations,@xcite or are confined to move through mesoscopic channels , @xcite show shapiro - like phase - locking .",
    "moreover , systems with many degrees of freedom in the presence of quenched disorder can also exhibit phase - locking when there is a dynamically induced periodicity , like charge density waves @xcite and vortex lattices in superconductors with random pinning.@xcite    in the phase - locking examples mentioned above , the ac - drive is applied parallel to the dc - drive .",
    "however , it was recently shown that a different type of phase - locking , distinct from shapiro phase - locking , is possible in vortex lattices if the ac - force is applied _ perpendicular _ to the dc - force.@xcite in this case the interference effect is due to an effective _ parametric _ ac drive in the longitudinal direction , which is induced by the transverse ac drive . in several systems , like charge density waves or single degree of freedom systems ( _ e.g. _ , the single josephson junction ) , the dynamical variables are such that perturbations or displacements can be induced in only one direction ( _ i.e. _ , the displacement field is a scalar ) .",
    "an important characteristic of vortex lattices in superconductors is that the displacement field is two dimensional .",
    "in particular , the behavior of displacements in the direction perpendicular to the driving force shows phenomena like a transverse critical current @xcite and a transverse freezing transition @xcite at high velocities . phase locking in ac - driven vortex lattices , where the ac and dc forces are perpendicular ,",
    "arises as a direct consequence of the nonlinear coupling between the two directions of motions .",
    "transverse phase - locking has been reported for vortex lattices moving in rectangular or triangular pinning arrays @xcite as well as in arrays of randomly distributed pinning centers.@xcite in this paper we investigate the possibility of transverse phase locking in a two dimensional ( 2d ) fully frustrated jja , where the average of the external magnetic field corresponds to one half flux quantum per plaquette , @xmath15 .",
    "this system has several attractive properties .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) breaks the axial symmetry in the direction of the bias current , and 2d - cooperative behavior may come into play .",
    "this leads to the well - known fractional giant shapiro steps @xcite induced by a longitudinal ac current .",
    "it also , as we will demonstrate in this paper , allows for _ transverse _ phase locking when the ac current is perpendicular to the dc current , since the two directions of motion become coupled .",
    "non - equilibrium dynamical phases for fully frustrated jjas driven by a dc current have previously been studied.@xcite phase locking can be used to characterize temporal order in the different dynamical phases of the jja at high velocities by their ac - response , as was done in ref .   for bulk superconductors .    here , we report transverse phase locking steps in the @xmath0 characteristics , similar to the longitudinal giant shapiro steps , but with very different characteristic dependencies on external ac - drive amplitude @xmath17 and frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the critical depinning current in the system with transverse ac drive is _ larger _ than the critical current of the dc driven system . for @xmath18 the depinning critical current @xmath19 and the phase - locked step width @xmath20 for @xmath21 increase quadratically with @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath22 we find windows of @xmath23 where depinning is hysteretic and the periodic phase - locked dynamical states become unstable .",
    "we characterize the dynamical states around the phase - locking interference condition in the @xmath0 curve with the voltage noise , lyapunov exponents and poincar sections .",
    "we find that zero temperature phase - locking behavior in large fully frustrated arrays is well described by an effective four plaquette model .",
    "the remainder of this paper is outlined as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model used for simulating the dynamics of the fully frustrated jja . in section iii",
    "we develop an analytical framework for predicting critical current and phase - locking properties of the fully frustrated jja .",
    "section iv presents simulated transverse phase - locking steps in typical @xmath0 curves obtained from an effective four plaquette model for the jja .",
    "we calculate numerically the dependence of the critical current and the magnitude of phase - locking steps with the amplitude @xmath17 and frequency @xmath3 of the external ac - drive .",
    "the results obtained are analyzed in more detail by studying voltage noise , lyapunov exponents and poincar sections for the dynamical states around the phase - locking interference condition .",
    "we also compare numerical simulations results for large arrays with those obtained using the effective four plaquette model .",

    "current and phase differences in the junctions are described by a repeated two - junction by two - junction ( @xmath27 plaquette ) superlattice unit cell .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite of large driven arrays suggest that this spatial periodicity is preserved when the dynamics is phase - locked to an external ac - perturbation applied in parallel to the dc force .",
    "we will show later , in section iv , that this is also a good approximation when the ac current is _ perpendicular _ to the dc current .",
    "we will therefore consider the simple system of a @xmath27 superlattice unit cell of the array and the associated gauge - invariant phase differences in a field of @xmath15 , with the dc current ( per plaquette ) @xmath28 perpendicular to an ac current ( per plaquette ) @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",

    "however , it is clear from the figure that the critical current , @xmath123 , for decreasing dc - bias may be smaller than for increasing dc - bias ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "since this is a multi - dimensional system , the critical current may be hysteretic , such that decreasing the dc - current , @xmath28 , for non - zero voltage states ( @xmath125 ) is subject to different critical characteristics .",
    "one simple way of investigating this is to assume a non - phase - locked state of voltage @xmath126 , such that @xmath127 .",

    "we will still assume ( 17 ) to be an appropriate description of the transverse current .",

    "we have , for comparison , included an example of the comparable range of phase - locking for the longitudinally ac - driven jja as an inset . a noticeable feature of figure [ fig : fig7]a is that the dynamical instability discussed above around @xmath135 seems to widen as the frequency is lowered . figure [ fig :",

    "this is in agreement with the above analysis that indicates the critical current hysteresis is present in the vicinity of @xmath135 , which is also the location of the dynamical instabilities of the locked phase of the @xmath20 step .    in summary , around the transverse phase",

    "thereby , the first harmonic of longitudinal voltage fluctuations is locked to @xmath198 , as expected for this step , since it corresponds to @xmath199 in the phase - locking condition @xmath52 .",
    "the phase - locking with a double frequency corresponds to the case when the vortex lattice oscillates in full synchrony with the transverse ac - current , and the ground state repeats itself after one period of the ac drive . in the transverse voltage power spectrum , @xmath200",
    ", there is a sharp peak at @xmath3 .",
    "this is characteristic of transverse phase - locking : the dynamics in the transverse direction locks at half the frequency than the dynamics of the longitudinal direction .",
    "this is so because in a single period of the ac - drive , @xmath182 , the longitudinal component moves forward @xmath9 steps in the lattice period @xmath6 , while the transverse component completes only the first half of its oscillation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10]e , we show the poincar section corresponding to this case in the regime b. the figure shows a very localized poincar section since the trajectory always comes back approximately to the same location in phase space in each ac cycle , since the trajectory is periodic ( closed orbit ) .",
    "now we analyze the case corresponding to the a regime , which is for a current outside the step , @xmath201 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9]a . in this case",
    "we see again in @xmath192 a peak at @xmath198 and in @xmath193 a peak at @xmath3 .",
    "however , the peaks now have a small broadening , and small amplitude satellite peaks have appeared at neighboring frequencies .",
    "this is evidence of another kind of long - term behavior , namely quasiperiodic dynamics .",
    "we can corroborate this with the corresponding poincar section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10]d .",
    "it consists now on a closed one dimensional curve , which means that trajectories wind around on a torus , never intersecting itself and yet never quite closing , typical of a quasiperiodic orbit .",
    "we have also looked at the time dependent estimates of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath202 .",
    "we find that @xmath203 for finite @xmath31 , but its absolute value tends to zero for long times as @xmath204 , consistent with quasiperiodic behavior .",
    "let us now study the last case , corresponding to regime c. this is done for @xmath195 and @xmath179 in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig10]c .",
    "we see that there are broad peaks in the spectrum in both directions , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , and that there is a marked increase in the power spectra for low frequencies . moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10]f we show the corresponding poincar section which consists on successive points jumping from one region of phase space to another and forming a complex curve , which does not seem to close on itself .",
    "it is rather difficult to decide from this plot if it corresponds to a quasiperiodic orbit or to a low dimensional attractor of a weakly chaotic orbit .",
    "we have obtained also the time dependent estimate of the lyapunov exponent also for this case .",
    "we find that @xmath205 for all @xmath31 , but its magnitude is decreasing with time as @xmath204 as far as we have been able to observe . the fact that @xmath202 is possitive for finite @xmath31 means that there is a dynamical instability that causes a seemingly chaotic behavior at intermediate times and a large noise as seen in the low frequency power spectrum .",
    "however , for long times it is very likely that the system will settle in a quasiperiodic dynamics with @xmath206 . in any case ,",
    "the regime c is very different from the regime a , as can be seen by comparing the power spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10]c .    another view of the dynamics can be obtained by looking at the behavior of the lyapunov exponent and the noise in the region , where a step is expected , as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "we proceed as follows : for a given @xmath207 , we compute the set of values of lyapunov exponents @xmath170 and low frequency longitudinal noise @xmath208 that correspond to currents @xmath28 in the region of voltage where a step is expected .",
    "( we look at @xmath28 values for which @xmath209 , we consider @xmath210 ) .",

    "10a and the values of @xmath211 as a functions of @xmath23 in fig .",
    "the vertical lines in the plot correspond to the zeroes of @xmath212 .",
    "we see clearly that near these values there are windows of dynamical instability where @xmath213 and where the noise @xmath211 is large . in the regions of phase - locking",
    "we find a couple of interesting results that are worth mentioning .",
    "( i ) the most negative value of the lyapunov exponent occurs in the middle of the phase - locked step and its magnitude is proportional to the step width @xmath20 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_31 ] ) .",
    "( ii ) the largest value of the noise @xmath211 occurs at the edge of the phase - locked step ; its magnitude is also proportional to the step width @xmath20 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq_31 ] ) .",
    "we will now consider the quality of the simple @xmath27 model as representing the dynamics of large @xmath214 jjas .",
    "it is known that collective effects at high currents may come into play . at high currents , the @xmath215 symmetry of the ground state",
    "can be broken because a driving current can induce domain walls .",
    "@xcite simulations of @xmath0 curves with the rsj model and free boundary conditions , for @xmath15 and @xmath216 have reported a chaotic regime at @xmath217 related to the motion of domain walls .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that open boundary conditions nucleate domain walls leading to a critical current lower than de analytic value @xmath218 at @xmath216.@xcite moreover , ciria and giovanella @xcite have shown microscopically that different dynamical states are possible for the longitudinal shapiro steps . besides the checkerboard ground state configuration , other stable solutions with domain - walls are possible . then , depending on dc current value and history , domain walls can appear , which are not permitted in the four plaquette model .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate to what extent the four plaquette model is valid in the transverse ac driven case , we have calculated numerically @xmath0 curves for @xmath214 arrays , for @xmath219 , with the full rsj model used before in ref .  .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in both directions in the presence of an external dc current , @xmath28 , plus a perpendicular ac current , @xmath220 .",

    "we use a dc current step @xmath228 to obtain @xmath19 and @xmath229 to calculate the step width .",
