    "at cern , the use of large underground high - energy physics experiments , for comic ray studies , has an important tradition  @xcite .",
    "alice is an experiment mainly designed to study the products of nucleus - nucleus collisions at cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "the underground location of the alice detector , with 30 m of overburden composed of subalpine molasse , is an ideal place for muon based underground experiments . using this facilities",
    ", we plan to observe muon bundles generated by cosmic ray primary particles with energies around the knee region @xmath1ev",
    "acorde ( the alice cosmic ray detector ) is an array of scintillator modules that will act as a cosmic ray trigger for alice calibration , as well as , multiple muon trigger to study high energy cosmic rays .",
    "acorde is an array of plastic scintillator modules ( 60 at the present ) placed on the top sides of the central alice magnet , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "more modules , to achieve a better angular coverage and acceptance , will be added later .",
    "each module , see figure  2 , consists of two plastic scintillator paddles with @xmath2  @xmath3 effective area , arranged in a doublet configuration .",
    "each doublet consists of two superimposed scintillator counters , with their corresponding photomultipliers active faces , looking back to back .",
    "a coincidence signal , in a time window of 40 ns , from the two scintillator paddles gives , for each module , the trigger hit .",
    "a pci bus electronics card have been developed in order to measure plateau and efficiency of the module counters  @xcite .",
    "the signal of each acorde scintillator channel is applied to a leading edge discriminator .",
    "after the conversion of each pmt negative signal in a digital hit , a single or a multi - coincidence trigger signal is generated . in both cases we will use a tracking system to identify which acorde modules were hit .",
    "afterwards , these module hit information will be stored in a fifo memory before being sent to the daq system through the detectors data link ( ddl ) .",
    "the cosmic ray trigger system ( crt ) will provide a fast level - zero trigger signal to the central trigger processor , when atmospheric muons impinge upon the alice detector",
    ". the signal will be useful for calibration , alignment and performance of several alice tracking detectors , mainly the alice time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the alice transition radiation detector ( trd ) and the alice inner tracking system ( its ) .",
    "the typical rate for single atmospheric muons crossing the alice cavern will be less than hz / m@xmath4 .",
    "the expected rate for multi - muon events will be around or less than @xmath5 hz / m@xmath4 .",
    "atmospheric muons will need an energy of at least @xmath6 gev to reach the alice hall , while the upper energy limit for reconstructed muons in the tpc will be less than 2 tev , depending on the alice magnetic field intensity ( up to @xmath7 t ) .",
    "we have designed and implemented the necessary electronics to do the following tasks : lhc clock synchronization , send single and multi - muon trigger signal to the central trigger processor , send a wake - up signal to alice - trd and communicate with the daq through a daq source interface card(siu ) .",
    "also , we complete the acorde detector control system , to monitor the performance of the scintillator counter array .        at the present , we have 20 acorde modules already installed and the related electronics working .",
    "the alice - tpc above ground commissioning is proceeding based on acorde trigger using 10 modules placed on the top and 10 underneath the alice tpc ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we have implemented a dedicated cosmic ray trigger for alice which in conjunction with other alice detectors provides a powerful tool for the study of muon bundles properties .",
