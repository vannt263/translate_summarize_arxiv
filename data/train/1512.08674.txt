    "according to the scenario of old big - bang cosmology based on the theory of general relativity ( gr ) , our universe has begun from a finite past including an initial singularity , which is widely considered as a conceptual disadvantage .",
    "furthermore , since standard big - bang cosmology was incapable of solving the horizon , flatness and magnetic monopole problems at early universe the inflation mechanism was introduced @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to describe the late - time acceleration a small positive cosmological constant was added , giving rise to the standard model of the universe , namely @xmath1cdm cosmology . however , despite the remarkable achievements of this paradigm , its physical content , concerning both early and late - time accelerating phases , is still ambiguous , and moreover amongst others one still faces the `` initial singularity problem '' .    concerning the initial singularity problem",
    ", one could try to confront it through the `` emergent universe '' scenario @xcite .",
    "in particular , in such a scenario the universe is originated from a static state , known as `` einstein static universe '' ( esu ) , and then it entered the inflationary phase , without ever passing through the big - bang singularity .",
    "however , remaining in the gr framework , and despite fine - tuning , perturbation analysis shows that the initial singularity can not be completely removed .",
    "indeed , esu is severely influenced by the initial conditions such as perturbations which are prevailed in the ultra - violet ( uv ) limit , and it is indeed unstable against classical perturbations which eventually make it collapse towards a singularity @xcite .    in order to alleviate the above problems , alternative cosmological models have been developed .",
    "a first direction is to introduce new , exotic , forms of matter , which in the framework of general relativity could provide an explanation of the observed universe behavior @xcite .",
    "a second direction is to modify the gravitational sector , obtaining a theory that still possess gr as a particular limit , but still being able to describe the universe at large scales through the extra gravitational degrees of freedom @xcite . indeed , in modified gravity",
    ", amongst others one can cure the emergent universe scenario , by making stable einstein static universe .",
    "hence , a large amount of activity was devoted to the study of the stability of the einstein static universe in various gravitational modifications , such as einstein - cartan theory @xcite , lyra geometry @xcite , non - constant pressure models @xcite , @xmath2 gravity @xcite , @xmath3 gravity @xcite , loop quantum cosmology @xcite , massive gravity @xcite and doubly general relativity @xcite , induced matter theory @xcite , braneworld models @xcite , etc .",
    "one interesting gravitational modification , proposed by hoava , is the so - called hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "this construction was motivated by the observation that the insertion of higher - order derivative terms in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian establishes renormalizability , since the graviton propagator at high energies is modified @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this leads to a severe problem , since the equations of motion involve higher - order time derivatives and hence the theory includes ghosts .",
    "however , since it is the higher spatial derivatives that improve renormalizability while it is the higher time derivatives that lead to ghosts , one could think of constructing a theory that would allow for the inclusion of higher spatial derivatives only .",
    "indeed , this is what it is achieved in hoava - lifshitz theory @xcite , and since higher spatial derivatives are not accompanied by higher time ones , in the uv the theory exhibits power - counting renormalizability but still without ghosts .",
    "such a theory definitely violates lorentz invariance , however it presents gr as an infra - red fixed point , where lorentz invariance is restored .",
    "application of hoava - lifshitz gravity in a cosmological framework leads to very interesting behavior in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "finally , one can proceed further by construction extensions such as @xmath0 hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , since in such scenarios one can obtain a unified mechanism for the early - time inflation and the late - time acceleration @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    "we deduce that it is worthy to examine the realization of esu and of the emergent universe scenario in the framework of hoava - lifshitz gravity and its extensions .",
    "the stability issues of the esu in the framework of an ir modification of hoava - lifshitz gravity , representing a soft breaking of the so - called `` detailed balance condition '' , against linear homogeneous scalar perturbations , was explored in @xcite .",
    "as it is shown , there exists a large class of stable solutions , for large regions of barotropic equation - of - state parameter and model parameters , however the possibility for a transition to the inflationary era is ambiguous .",
    "additionally , in the context of original hoava - lifshitz gravity such a study was performed in @xcite , where it was shown that a stable esu can be realized in the presence of a negative cosmological constant , however although the big bang singularity can be avoided the transition from this stable state to the inflationary era is impossible . on the other hand , in the case of the generalized version of hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , it was shown that if the cosmic scale factor satisfies certain conditions initially and if the equation - of - state parameter approaches a critical value , the corresponding stable critical point coincides with the unstable one , and consequently a phase transition to the inflationary era can be provided @xcite .    in the present work we are interested in studying the emergent universe scenario in the framework of a hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 gravity , and in particular in investigating the realization and stability of the einstein static universe and the possibility of the phase transition to the inflationary era .",
    "the plan of the manuscript is the following : in section [ themodel ] , we briefly review hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 gravity and we apply it in a cosmological framework . in section [ phasespaceanalysis ]",
    ", we perform a dynamical analysis in the phase space , while in section [ perturbationsanalysis ] , we extract the conditions under which the scenario at hand is stable against scalar perturbations .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the @xmath0 hoava - lifshitz theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this construction one",
    "starts from the usual hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite and adds the @xmath0 sector @xcite , namely one replaces the ricci scalar @xmath4 by arbitrary functions of it .",
    "we start by using the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formalism in a ( 3 + 1 ) space - time @xcite , writing the metric as @xmath5 with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the lapse function , the shift function and the metric of three - dimensional spatial hypersurface @xmath10 . in the framework of standard @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "the modified action is @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature @xmath4 .",
    "this is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the three - dimensional scalar curvature , extrinsic curvature and a unit vector perpendicular to the three - dimensional spacelike hypersurface @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath15 is an object associated with the spatial metric @xmath9 of the hypersurface , and @xmath16 is defined as @xmath18 hence , one can now write down the action of @xmath0 hoava - lifshitz gravity as @xcite @xmath19 with the extended scalar curvature @xmath20 given by @xmath21 in the above expression the running dimensionless constant @xmath22 appears due to the `` super - metric '' , defined on the hypersurface @xmath10 as @xmath23 while @xmath24 has been inserted in order to embed the satisfaction of the `` detailed balance condition '' , which is defined by an action @xmath25 $ ] on @xmath10 as @xmath26}{\\delta h_{ij}}=\\sqrt{h}e^{ij}\\;.\\ ] ] the detailed balance condition was inspired by the condensed matter physics @xcite and it implies that the potential term in the lagrangian of a @xmath27 dimensional theory is derivable from the variation of the @xmath28 dimensional action @xcite . in particular , while the shift variables @xmath29 and spatial metric @xmath30 are function of both space and time , the lapse variable is assumed to be a function of time only , namely @xmath31 , an assumption compatible with the foliation preserving diffeomorphism . + in the initial formulation of",
    "@xmath0 hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite kluson focused on a lagrangian of a new class of @xmath0 gravity theories with respect to the projectability condition , namely @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is an arbitrary function of the auxiliary field @xmath34 , which is a function of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , namely @xmath37 by setting the typical function @xmath38 , the corresponding action @xmath39 reads as @xmath40 with @xmath41 the gravitational constant , set for simplicity to @xmath42 in the following . in the above action we have also considered the matter sector characterized by @xmath43 .",
    "additionally , one could extend this action in a non - projectable version @xcite .",
    "we mention that the scenario of action ( [ 9,1 ] ) is invariant under the foliation preserving diffeomorphism and not under the full @xmath27 diffeomorphism , which is in contrast to the usual @xmath0 gravity theories .",
    "the linearized version of the action ( [ 9,1 ] ) writes as @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which as expected reproduces the original hoava - lifshitz action . on the other hand , note that by choosing @xmath45 in ( [ 6,1 ] )",
    ", one obtains the usual @xmath0 gravity .",
    "therefore , the non - linear action ( [ 9,1 ] ) is a form of hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 gravity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the lagrangian density of the action ( [ 9,1 ] ) is not of the exact @xmath0 form with any modified scalar curvature expression .",
    "instead , it belongs to a class of models where the lagrangian depends on the kinetic term @xmath46 and the potential term @xmath47 in a different way , and not only on the sum of the kinetic and the potential terms , as in the modified scalar curvature ( [ 6,1 ] ) ( note that such more general modified hoava - lifshitz theories , where the lagrangian can depend on the kinetic and potential terms independently , have also been considered in @xcite ) .    in order to apply the above theory in a cosmological framework , that is in order to construct hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 cosmology",
    ", we impose an frw metric on the 3-hypersurface @xmath48 , namely @xmath49~,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the scale factor and with @xmath51 and @xmath42 corresponding to open , flat and closed universe , respectively .",
    "furthermore , concerning the matter content of the universe , we consider it to be a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor in co - moving coordinates given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the four - velocity vector of the fluid , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the energy density and isotropic pressure , respectively . under these assumptions , the field equations derived from action ( [ 9,1 ] )",
    "give rise to the friedmann equations , which write as @xcite : the parameter @xmath56 is the effective cosmological constant , which similarly to the original version of hoava - lifshitz model must be negative for the running coupling parameter @xmath57 .",
    "we mention that the above equations include a negative energy density squared term @xmath58 , which can have a significant role for the early stage of the universe . technically speaking",
    ", the presence of @xmath58 term in the above friedmann equations is a direct upshot of nonlinear dependence to matter source in this modified gravity theory in the early universe .",
    "a detailed discussion on this subject is presented in @xcite .",
    "finally , let us point out that the value of @xmath22 is commonly divided into two ranges , namely @xmath59 and @xmath57 . however , phenomenological studies analyzing the observational data suggest that the value of @xmath22 is constrained in a narrow range around @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 @xcite , which was expected since gr is obtained for @xmath60 . hence ,",
    "in the following we restrict our analysis in the regime @xmath57 .    the cosmological application of hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 gravity proves to have many interesting features @xcite .",
    "amongst others it can provide a unified mechanism for the description of both the early - time inflation and the late - time acceleration , or alternatively it can give rise to bouncing solutions @xcite that can cure the initial - singularity problem .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to study if one can naturally obtain a stable einstein static universe in such a theory .",
    "we mention that , as it is well - known , the versions of hoava - lifshitz gravity with the projectability condition suffer from the strong - coupling problem @xcite .",
    "although this can be alleviated by going beyond the projectability condition @xcite , the corresponding @xmath0 extension would be too difficult to allow for an analytical investigation of the emergent universe scenario .",
    "hence , in the present work we consider the hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 gravity with the detailed balance and projectability condition as a first approach on the background cosmological evolution , having in mind that the investigation of the full theory is necessary as a next step .",
    "in this section we intend to perform a phase - space analysis , investigating non - flat hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 cosmology as a first - order cosmological dynamical system . this study will show whether the einstein static universe ( esu ) corresponds to a solution in which the universe can remain for very large time intervals",
    ". if this is not the case , then the realization of esu will be highly improbable without a fine tuning of the initial conditions .",
    "using taylor expansion in terms of @xmath62 ( note that we have set @xmath63 ) , the first and second friedmann equations ( [ 1,a]),([2,a ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath64+{\\cal{o}}(\\rho^{3}),\\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath65 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ !",
    "-3(\\omega+1)\\rho(1+\\rho)h^{2}+{\\cal{o } } ( \\rho^{3})~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected terms of the order @xmath66 and beyond .",
    "this means that only terms up to contribution of dark radiations , i.e @xmath67 , are kept .",
    "also it is easy to check that in the leading order approximation , these reproduce the friedmann equations in standard hoava - lifshitz gravity model . additionally , in the above expressions we have considered the matter fluid to correspond to the standard barotropic one , with equation of state of the form @xmath68 .",
    "let us now focus on the esu .",
    "this is described by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and hence the above friedmann equations become @xmath71=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath72=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the case of spatially closed universe , i.e. for @xmath73 , equation ( [ 5,b ] ) has two roots , namely @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 defined as @xmath77 these two solutions correspond to two critical points .",
    "as we can straightforwardly see , for any barotropic parameter @xmath78 apart from @xmath79 , namely apart from a simple cosmological constant , both solutions ( [ 1 ] ) become unphysical since they lead to @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath79 the two critical points ( [ 1 ] ) become @xmath81 which are both unphysical .",
    "hence , none of these critical points signals the presence of an esu in closed geometry , and thus they do not deserve further investigation .    for the case of open universe , i.e. for @xmath82 , equation ( [ 5,b ] ) has two roots , namely @xmath83 where @xmath84 equation ( [ 2 ] ) will result in two real solutions provided that @xmath85\\rho_{0}^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\bigg[9(\\omega+1)+4|\\lambda_{w}|\\bigg]\\rho_{0 } + 2|\\lambda_{w}|\\geq0~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the case @xmath79 the above inequality holds for any value of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and thus we obtain two critical points , namely @xmath88 and thus only the latter is physical . by replacing it into ( [ 4,b ] )",
    "we obtain the corresponding energy density as @xmath89.\\ ] ] both of them are physically acceptable ( i.e. @xmath90 ) with the condition latexmath:[\\ ] ]    thus , using ( [ 10,b ] ) in order to find @xmath107 in terms of @xmath108 , and substituting into ( [ 13,b ] ) , leads to the following differential equation : @xmath109 where we have defined @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 hence , from the differential equation ( [ 14,b ] ) we deduce that in order to have a stable esu against scalar perturbations in the framework of hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 gravity , the following condition must be satisfied : @xmath114    as usual , the instabilities - absence condition ( [ 19,b ] ) must be applied in the background solutions of the model , extracted in the previous section .",
    "since we are dealing with einstein static universe , these solutions were characterized only by @xmath115 , with @xmath78 and @xmath100 the model parameters , and were summarized in expressions ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 6 * ] ) , ( [ 2 * ] ) and table [ table a ] . since in the case of a closed universe esu was not realized , we focus on the case of open geometry . for the case",
    "@xmath79 , by setting the background configuration @xmath116 from equations ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 6 * ] ) , subject to the constraint ( [ 6 * * ] ) , and substituting them into equations ( [ 15,b])-([18,b ] ) , we immediately find that inequality ( [ 19,b ] ) holds .",
    "similarly , in the case @xmath117 , substituting the values of @xmath118 and @xmath99 from ( [ 2 * ] ) and table i into ( [ 15,b])-([18,b ] ) we deduce that inequality ( [ 19,b ] ) is satisfied too .",
    "hence , in summary , we can see that the esu obtained in the precious section is free of perturbative instabilities .",
    "in this work we performed an investigation of the einstein static universe ( esu ) in the framework of hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 gravity .",
    "such a gravitational modification is obtained by employing higher - order @xmath4-terms , keeping both the detailed balance and projectability conditions , and although contrary to the usual @xmath0 gravity it is not full @xmath27 diffeomorphism invariant , in the limit of linear approximation it recovers the usual hoava - lifshitz counterpart .",
    "hence , we were interested in examining whether the cosmological application of this theory allows for the realization of esu , which is the basic concept in the realization of the emergent universe scenario .",
    "if this is the case , then the initial - singularity problem of standard big - bag cosmology can be alleviated .",
    "as a first step we performed a dynamical analysis of hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 cosmology in the phase space .",
    "we showed that in the case of closed geometry there is no stable physically meaningful esu , while in the case of open geometry the esu can be an attractor in the presence of both exotic and usual matter .",
    "however , the most physically interesting result was that in the case of open geometry esu is stable and thus it can be realized .",
    "nevertheless , in order to obtain a full realization of the emergent universe scenario we need an additional mechanism that could make the universe deviate from esu after a large time interval , and enter into the usual expanding thermal history , which can be obtained only through an exotic matter sector with unconventional equation - of - state parameter .",
    "as a second step we examined the behavior of esu under scalar perturbations , desiring to extract the conditions under which the scenario at hand is free of perturbative instabilities such as ghosts or laplacian instabilities .",
    "our analysis showed that the background esu solutions are free of perturbative instabilities .",
    "the above results imply that esu can be safely realized in the framework of hoava - lifshitz - like @xmath0 cosmology , however the emergent universe scenario is not straightforward in such a gravitational modification , since an exotic form of matter is required .",
    "hence , within the same theory we have both a cosmological advantage , namely that we alleviate the initial - singularity problem , as well as a theoretical advantage , namely that the underlying theory has an improved renormalizable behavior in the uv .",
    "these features make the above construction a good candidate for the description of nature , that is worthy to be investigated further .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee whose careful and useful comments led to a very improved revision of the paper .",
