    "a general feature of several kinetic equations is the fact that their solutions in a domain @xmath4 with boundaries can not be infinitely differentiable at the points of the phase space @xmath5 for which @xmath6 and @xmath7 is tangent to @xmath8 even if the initial data are arbitrarily smooth .",
    "this set of points is usually denoted as singular set .",
    "this property of the solutions of kinetic equations was found by guo in his study of the vlasov - poisson system ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the case of the one - species vlasov - poisson system in",
    "3-dimensional bounded domains with specular reflection boundary conditions , the convexity of the boundary plays a crucial role in determining the regularity of solutions ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the boundary of the domain is flat or convex , then one can show that a trajectory on the singular set is separated from regular one in the interior , so that classical solutions exist globally in time and are @xmath9 in phase space variables except on the singular set .    however , if a domain is nonconvex , then even in the vlasov equation without interactions between the particles and with inflow boundary condition , a classical @xmath9 solution fails to exist in general ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    the lack of smoothness of solutions of the vlasov - poisson system is closely related to the fact that the flow describing the evolution of the characteristic curves is not a @xmath10  function at the singular set , something which has been observed in the dynamics of billiards , even if in this case there are not gravitational or electrical fields ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .    in the case of the boltzmann equation near maxwellian , under inflow ,",
    "diffuse , specular reflection and bounce - back boundary conditions , it is shown in @xcite that if a domain is strictly convex , then the solution is ( weighted ) @xmath9 away from the singular set . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is a concave boundary point , one can construct an initial condition which induces a discontinuous solution in any given time interval ( cf .",
    "a type of equation in which the regularizing effects can be expected to be stronger than those mentioned above among the kinetic equations are the fokker - planck equations .",
    "these equations contain second order operators in some of the variables ( the velocities ) , but due to the specific form of the transport terms in the remaining variables ( positions ) the solutions of these equations are smooth in all their variables .",
    "this issue has been extensively studied in the mathematics literature ( cf .",
    "for instance hbook , @xcite as well as additional references in section hypsection of chapter [ adjproblems ] ) . on the other hand boundary value problems for the fokker planck equation",
    "have been considered in many physical situations , including diffusion controlled reactions and the dynamics of semiflexible polymers ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) and in general in problems involving the dynamics of brownian motion described by uhlenbeck - ornstein processes in the presence of boundaries ( cf . for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . from a pde point of view",
    ", the solutions are expected to be more regular due to the smoothing effect of the random force .",
    "this was clarified by bouchut in the case of the 3-dimensional whole space problem for the vlasov - poisson - fokker - planck equations @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of the boundary , there had been not much improvement for a few decades .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the onset of singular behaviours at the singular set takes place even for kinetic equations associated to hypoelliptic operators . as indicated above ,",
    "one of the best known hypoelliptic operators is the one associated to the kinetic fokker - planck equation , also known as kolmogorov equation:@xmath11where @xmath12 and @xmath13 for some @xmath14 and some domain @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that any solution of ( [ i0e1 ] ) is @xmath16 in spite of the fact that the second order operator @xmath17 acts only in the variable @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , it turns out that in domains @xmath4 with boundaries , singular sets in the sense of kinetic equations arise for some classes of boundary conditions . more precisely , there are some classes of boundary conditions , which arise naturally from the physical interpretation of the equation ( [ i0e1 ] ) for which the hypoellipticity property can be extended to a large fraction of the boundary @xmath18 but it fails along some subsets of @xmath19 in those sets the solutions are just hlder continuous .",
    "one example of this situation is the following .",
    "suppose that we restrict the analysis to the case @xmath20 and that we solve ( [ i0e1 ] )  in the domain @xmath21 .",
    "in these cases the singular set reduces either to the two points @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that we study this problem with the absorbing boundary condition:@xmath23the problem ( [ i0e1 ] ) , ( [ i0e2 ] ) has been studied in @xcite where it has been proved that the solutions are at most hlder continuous in a neighbourhood of the singular points @xmath24 a more detailed discussion about the problem with absorbing boundary conditions will be given in chapter [ absorbing ] .",
    "the main results of this paper are obtained for a different type of boundary conditions .",
    "more precisely we will consider the following problem:@xmath25with the following boundary condition:@xmath26where @xmath27 we are particularly interested in the case in which @xmath28 notice that the physical meaning of ( [ s0e2 ] ) is that the particles arriving to the wall @xmath29 with a velocity @xmath30 bounce back to the domain @xmath31 with a new velocity @xmath32 notice that in the case @xmath33 the particles bounce elastically , but for @xmath34 the collisions are inelastic and the particles lose a fraction of their energy in the collisions .",
    "we will solve ( [ s0e1 ] ) , ( [ s0e2 ] ) with the initial condition:@xmath35where @xmath36 is a probability measure in @xmath37 .",
    "in this case the singular point is @xmath38 we are interested in the construction of measure valued solutions of the problem ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that for some choices of @xmath0 we might have @xmath39 for @xmath40 moreover , @xmath41 is a @xmath42 function for @xmath43 but it would be only possible to obtain uniform estimates in some suitable hlder norms if @xmath5 is close to the singular point . actually we will obtain information about the behaviour of the solutions near the singular point for the adjoint problem of ( [ s0e1 ] ) , ( [ s0e2 ] ) which proves that the solutions of this problem are at most hlder continuous .",
    "it is possible to give the following physical motivation to the problem ( s0e1)-([s0e3 ] ) .",
    "suppose that we have a  particle @xmath44 which moves in the half - line @xmath45 we will assume that , as long as @xmath46 the dynamics of the particle is similar to that of a brownian particle , but that , every time that the particle reaches @xmath47 it bounces inelastically , that is , the absolute value of its velocity is multiplied by a restitution coefficient @xmath48with @xmath49 formally we can state that the dynamics of the particle is given by the following set of equations:@xmath50where @xmath51 is the white noise stochastic process , which formally satisfies @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes average .",
    "it is not a priori obvious if the process defined by means of the equations ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) can be given a precise meaning .",
    "however , standard arguments of the theory of stochastic processes suggest that the probability of finding the particle @xmath55 in a region of the phase space @xmath56 is given by the probability density @xmath57    the first mathematical results for the problem ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) were obtained by mckean ( cf .",
    "more precisely , @xcite contains in particular the probability distribution of hitting times and hitting points , defined by means of the solutions of ( [ s1e1 ] ) with initial conditions @xmath58 the hitting times are defined as @xmath59 and the hitting points are defined by means of @xmath60 notice that a rescaling argument allows us to reduce the computation of the joint distribution of @xmath61 for @xmath62 to the case @xmath63 suppose that we denote as @xmath64 the sequence of consecutive times where the solutions of ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) with initial values @xmath65",
    "satisfy @xmath66 then , the results in @xcite imply that @xmath67 as @xmath68 @xmath69 with probability one if @xmath70 where @xmath71on the contrary , the results in @xcite imply that that for @xmath72 we have @xmath73 for any @xmath74 details about these results can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the results indicated above suggest that the solutions of ( [ s0e1])-(s0e3 ) should have a very different behaviour for @xmath2 and @xmath75 indeed , in the first case the equations ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) can not be expected to define the evolution of @xmath76 without some additional information about the behaviour of the solutions at the singular point @xmath38 on the contrary , the problem ( s0e1)-([s0e3 ] ) should be able to define a unique dynamics for @xmath76 if @xmath77 the main goal of this paper is to show that we can have different evolutions for the problem ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) if @xmath78 on the contrary , we will prove that for @xmath79 no additional information is required in order to define the unique evolution of the problem .",
    "the problem ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) has been also considered in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite arrives to conclusions analogous to those which follow from mckean s results by means of the analysis of some particular solutions of the fokker - planck equation associated to ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) as well as numerical simulations .",
    "the authors of @xcite claimed that the solutions of ( s1e1 ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) undergo inelastic collapse for @xmath78 more precisely , it was claimed that for @xmath2 the brownian particle with inelastic collisions stops its motion in finite time with probability one , while for @xmath79 the brownian particle with inelastic collisions has positive velocity for any time .",
    "however , some papers in the physics literature raised doubts about the results in @xcite .",
    "it was claimed in @xcite , @xcite , on the basis of numerical simulations , that `` inelastic collapse '' for @xmath2 can not be observed .",
    "there is a detailed discussion about these seemingly contradictory results in @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of this paper was that for @xmath2 the particle @xmath80 solutions of ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) arrive to @xmath81 in finite time .",
    "however the particle @xmath82 does not stay there for later times . the main argument given in @xcite to support",
    "this conclusion is a detailed analysis of a stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation associated to the problem ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) .",
    "such stationary solution exhibits a flux of particles from the point @xmath81 to the region @xmath45 this flow of particles would be balanced by the flux of particles arriving towards the origin as predicted in @xcite by mckean .",
    "suppose that we denote as @xmath41 the probability density which gives the probability of finding one particle solving ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) in any region of the phase space @xmath83 inelastic collapse would imply that @xmath84 as @xmath85 on the other hand , the steady solution described in @xcite is different from @xmath86 and this suggests that the particles arriving to @xmath81 do not necessarily remain there .",
    "we will prove in this paper that if @xmath87 the solutions of ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) are nonunique .",
    "more precisely , it is possible to obtain different nonnegative solutions of this fokker - planck equation with a different asymptotic behaviour as @xmath88 actually , the solutions of ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) that we will construct in this paper will be measure - valued solutions and they will differ in the amount of mass that they contain at the point @xmath89i.e . @xmath90",
    "the intuitive explanation behind this nonuniqueness result is the following .",
    "if @xmath70 the solutions of the problem ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) reach the point @xmath91 in a finite time with probability one .",
    "after reaching that point it is possible to give several dynamic laws for the evolution of the particle @xmath92 for instance , the particle could remain trapped at the origin , or it could continue their movement , or it could remain trapped at @xmath93 during some time and then restart its motion again .",
    "the situation is essentially similar to the one of a brownian particle moving in a half - line @xmath94 which reaches @xmath95 with probability one , and there , it can be either absorbed , or to be reflected and continue its motion back to the region @xmath45 all these possibilities can be described in the case of this moving brownian particle by means of different boundary conditions at @xmath95 for the diffusion equation describing the probability density associated to that process . in the case of the fokker - planck equation ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] )",
    "the different evolution laws assumed for @xmath80 after reaching the origin , will result in different boundary conditions for @xmath41 as @xmath96    the nonuniqueness of the stochastic process associated to ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( s1e2 ) has been considered in the literature of stochastic processes .",
    "the paper @xcite describes the construction of a stochastic process which formally can be described by the stochastic differential equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the wiener process , and where we impose in addition that @xmath99 if @xmath100 @xmath101 for @xmath102 moreover , the process constructed in @xcite satisfies that the amount of time such that @xmath103 has zero measure @xmath101 notice that this stochastic process can be considered as a solution of ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( s1e2 ) with @xmath104 except for the fact that the solution is not requested to remain in the half - plane @xmath105 the surprising feature of the stochastic process obtained in @xcite is the fact that `` killing '' the process at the times when @xmath106 reaches the line @xmath107 does not force the particle to stay at this line for later times . on the contrary , the particle is able to escape from the point @xmath108 at later times . the results in @xcite indicate that the solutions of ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) can be expected to be nonunique .    on the other hand , the problem ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) has been considered in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for @xmath72 there is a unique entrance law in the half plane @xmath109 under the assumption that @xmath110 on the other hand , if @xmath2 the bounces of the particle at the line @xmath111 accumulate at the origin in a finite time . however , it is proved in @xcite that the particle does not remain necessarity at @xmath112 for later times , but on the contrary , it is possible to define a `` resurrected '' process after the particle reaches the origin .",
    "the measure of the times in which the solutions of this``resurrected '' process remain in the line @xmath113 is zero @xmath101    in this paper we will obtain several results for the problem ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) which can be viewed as the pde reformulation of the previously described results . more precisely , we will define a suitable concept of measured valued solutions for ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] )",

    "different boundary conditions can be thought as to be associated to different physical meanings for the corresponding evolution of the stochastic particle whose probability distribution is given by @xmath115 the boundary conditions obtained in this paper will be denoted as trapping , nontrapping and partially trapping boundary conditions at the point @xmath81 and they can be given respectively the meaning of a particle which after reaching the point @xmath81 remains trapped there for later times , alternatively does not remain trapped at @xmath116 and continuous its motion in the half plane @xmath117 or remains trapped during some characteristic time and continues then its motion in the half - plane @xmath45 we will not study in detail the case @xmath118 in this paper , because in that case some logarithmic terms appear in the asymptotics of the solutions near the singular point , something that makes the analysis rather cumbersome .",

    "the existence and uniqueness of solutions for @xmath79 will be also proved in this paper , although in this case we do not need any additional information about the solutions near the singular set .",
    "the main tool used in the proof of the results of this paper is the classical hille - yosida theorem .",
    "most of the technical difficulties in this paper arise from the fact that we need to prove that the operators involved in our problem satisfy the assumptions which allow to apply the hille - yosida theorem .",
    "in particular , the application of this theorem requires to prove the solvability of some problems of partial differential equations which in particular encode information about the behaviour of the solutions of ( s0e1)-([s0e3 ] ) near the singular set @xmath135 due to the fact that we are interested in measured valued solutions of ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) it will be convenient to work instead with the solutions of some suitable adjoint problems of ( s0e1)-([s0e3 ] ) which encode the different types of boundary conditions mentioned above if @xmath78 in order to apply hille - yosida s theorem we need to prove the solvability of some elliptic problems . this will be made by means of a suitable generalization of the classical perron s method which is able to deal with the singular behaviour of the solutions near the singular point .",
    "it is well known that perron s method allows us to obtain the solution of some elliptic equations as the supremum of the subsolutions associated to such equations .",
    "however , the application of such ideas to this problem yields to several technical difficulties .",
    "the main ones are the following ones . since the operator @xmath136 contains only the first order derivative in @xmath137 instead of the second order ones , it is possible to construct subsolutions for this problem which are discontinuous and have discontinuities along subsets of lines @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , such discontinuous subsolutions arise naturally applying perron s method to this class of equations .",
    "this fact will yield several technical difficulties which will be considered in chapter 5 . on the other hand the nonuniqueness of the solutions of ( s0e1)-([s0e3 ] ) will be related to the different asymptotic behaviours of the solutions near the singular point .",
    "the application of perron s method to the problem under consideration will require to study the properties of suitably defined sub and supersolutions with different behaviours near the singular point .",
    "we will use repeatedly the asymptotic symbol @xmath140 with the following meaning .",
    "suppose that @xmath141 are two functions defined in some region @xmath142 whose boundary contains the origin @xmath81 .",
    "we will say that @xmath143 as @xmath144 if @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in chapter 2 we study a simple toy model , namely the random walks of particles in a one - dimensional half lattice .",
    "this yields a simple diffusion problem in the limit when the size of the lattice converges to zero for which it is easy to obtain the boundary conditions at the lower extreme of the lattice .",
    "the analysis of this simpler problem will make more clear the meaning of the boundary conditions imposed at the solutions of ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) .",
    "chapter 3 describes in heuristic form the different expected asymptotic behaviours of the solutions of ( [ s0e1 ] ) , ( [ s0e2 ] ) near the singular point @xmath147 these heuristic asymptotics are used to obtain , at the formal level , a set of adjoint problems to ( [ s0e1 ] ) , ( [ s0e2 ] ) in chapter 4 . the onset of different adjoint problems is due to the possibility of having different asymptotics for the solutions of ( [ s0e1 ] ) , ( s0e2 ) if @xmath78 chapter 4 contains also a summary of hypoellipticity properties for the operator @xmath136 which are used in this paper .",
    "the well possedness of the adjoint problems , which have been precisely formulated in chapter 4 , is obtained in chapter 5 .",
    "this chapter is the most technical of the paper and it requires some detailed study of the asymptotics of the solutions of the adjoint problem near the singular point @xmath38 the results of chapter 5 are used in chapter 6 to give a precise definition of measured valued solutions for the problem ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) .",
    "chapter 7 contains a study of the different types of stationary solutions of the problem ( [ s0e1 ] ) , ( s0e2 ) in the strip @xmath148 depending on the different definitions of solutions given in chapter 6 .",
    "these stationary solutions are compared with the ones obtained in the physics literature ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we will clarify in which sense they are distributional solutions of ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) . in chapter 8",
    "we review the results which have been obtained for the problem ( [ i0e1 ] ) with the absorbing boundary conditions ( [ i0e2 ] ) .",
    "chapter 9 summarizes the results of this paper and it describes several open problems .",
    "in this section we discuss , using heuristic arguments , an elementary model which exhibits some similarities with the behaviour of the model ( [ s1e1 ] ) , ( [ s1e2 ] ) in the case @xmath78 the results described in this section are well known , since they just correspond to classical diffusion of a particle which reaches the boundary of a half - line .",
    "however , the results of this section will help to clarify the nonuniqueness of solutions for ( s0e1)-([s0e3 ] ) found in this paper and the physical meaning of the different types of solutions obtained for this problem .",
    "suppose that we consider the stochastic evolution of a particle in a lattice of points contained in the half - line @xmath149 if the distance between the lattice points converges to zero , the probability density of finding the particle at one specific position can be approximated by means of the one - dimensional diffusion equation .",

    "actually , it has been proved in @xcite that the solutions of ( [ i0e1 ] ) in the strip @xmath3316 with absorbing boundary conditions are hlder continuous in a neighbourhood of the singular points , and the optimal hlderianity exponent has been obtained there .",
    "these regularity properties were extended in @xcite to the case of the three dimensional half spaces and in @xcite to the case of bounded domains with curved boundaries , where the convexity was relaxed for the hypoellipticity up to the boundary unlike the vlasov and boltzmann equations .",
    "the long time asymptotics of the solutions of those problems has been also considered in @xcite , where it has been proved that the mass escapes from the strip @xmath3323 and as a consequence the total mass of @xmath76 in the strip @xmath3324 decreases exponentially .",
    "the hypoellipticity results ( up to the boundaries ) obtained in @xcite allow us to prove that the solutions of ( [ i0e1 ] ) decrease exponentially as well as their derivatives in any compact set which does not include the singular points @xmath81 and @xmath3307    probabilistic problems closely related to ( [ i0e1 ] ) have been considered in the physics literature .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the probability distribution for the velocity with which a brownian particle exits from the domain @xmath3325 is computed in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that inelastic conditions like in ( [ s0e2 ] ) allow us to impose different classes of boundary conditions at the singular set in one - dimensional problems .",
    "we have seen that , assuming that @xmath2 it is possible to impose trapping , nontrapping and partially trapping boundary conditions in a natural manner .",
    "it would be relevant to ascertain what is exactly the situation in higher dimensional problems , since in those cases , if the domain @xmath1006 where the problem is solved is contained in @xmath3326 it turns out that the singular set is a @xmath3327-dimensional set .",
    "the detailed structure of singularities and the specific form of the admissible boundary conditions in the singular set are an interesting mathematical question .",
    "we have not studied in detail in this paper the case of the critical exponent @xmath1919 in which logarithmic corrections to the solutions might be expected to appear near the singular points .",
    "the results in this paper do not cover the case @xmath3328 for which uniqueness of solutions might be expected , although on the other hand the physical meaning of this problem is `` a priori '' unclear .",
    "notice that in the limit case @xmath280 we might expect convergence of the solutions in bounded regions to the solutions of the problem with absorbing boundary conditions which was studied in @xcite .",
    "we also remark that in the case @xmath33 it is possible to obtain solutions of ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) in a simple form using the fact that the solutions of the problem in the whole space with initial data satisfying @xmath3329 solve the problem ( [ s0e1])-([s0e3 ] ) in @xmath3330 with @xmath3331    an issue that has been considered in @xcite is the long time asymptotics of the solutions in a strip with absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "it turns out that in that case the amount of mass left in the strip is bounded by an exponentially decreasing function .",
    "in the situation considered in this paper , the expected behaviour is the convergence to one stationary solution .",
    "the same issue can be formulated in unbounded domains . in the case of half - planes",
    "one can expect self - similar behaviours for the solutions",
    ".    it might be interesting to examine the possibility of having other types of boundary conditions allowing for the possibility of prescribing boundary conditions at the singular set",
    ". it might be possible to have this type of phenomenon in some classes of diffusive boundary conditions .",
    "is there some example of diffusive boundary condition for which the total energy of the particles is conserved yielding trajectories reaching the singular set in finite time ?",
    "is it possible to impose then additional boundary conditions of the types considered in this paper ?",
    "we have obtained estimates for the measured valued solutions @xmath76 using the duality formula ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "it should be possible to obtain detailed pointwise estimates for @xmath41 outside the singular set .",
    "however , in this paper we have just derived pointwise estimates for the functions @xmath433 solving the adjoint problems .",
