    "these users are those who interfere with each other in the uplink and when using full - duplex transmission or co - channel d2d communication .",
    "there are two popular point process models for the users , which we call models of type i and ii . however , no results are available for their pair correlation function ( pcf ) @xmath0 , which is critical for approximations by simpler , more tractable point processes . for the pcf between the typical base station ( bs ) and the users in a poisson point process ( ppp ) of bss of intensity @xmath1 , the approximation @xmath2",
    "is suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1 ) . however , this approximation is only accurate for lightly loaded networks , where a significant fraction of bss are idle in the rb considered .",
    "we provide tight approximations for @xmath0 and @xmath3 for heavily and lightly loaded networks .",
    "accordingly , ppps with intensity functions @xmath4 or @xmath5 , respectively , provide accurate approximations for the user point processes .",
    "we also propose the ginibre point process as an alternative model .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the space of motion - invariant counting measures ( point processes ) on @xmath7",
    ". for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is the voronoi cell of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is its boundary .",
    "@xmath13 , and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the expectation w.r.t .  the reduced palm measure @xcite .",
    "we let @xmath17 , @xmath18 , be a point chosen uniformly at random from @xmath19 , independently for different @xmath19 and independent from everything else .",
    "also we denote by @xmath20 the disk of radius @xmath21 centered at @xmath22 and define @xmath23 which is the area of the disk segment @xmath24 . as usual , @xmath25 is the area or length of @xmath19 , and we define @xmath26 .",
    "lastly , we use @xmath27 to denote an approximation that becomes better asymptotically .",
    "this model is suitable for a fully loaded network , where each cell has an active user in a given rb .",
    "its definition is based on a single point process only .    for @xmath8 , the user point process of type i is defined as @xmath28    in this model ,",
    "the user point process is obtained by a uniformly random displacement of each bs @xmath10 in its voronoi cell . by construction , @xmath29 , with the same density as @xmath30 .",

    "we write @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath47 the distance to the nearest voronoi cell boundary , denoted by @xmath48 , must be smaller than @xmath21 , and ( 2 ) the user @xmath43 in the neighboring cell ( across the cell boundary that @xmath42 is closest to ) must fall in the region @xmath49 , which , for small @xmath21 , is a disk segment of area @xmath50 .",
    "these two events can be defined as @xmath51 hence , for small @xmath21 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the area of the part of the voronoi cell that is within distance @xmath21 of its boundary .",

    "we have @xmath54 while @xmath55 as the area of the disk segment grows with @xmath56 . since the expectation over @xmath30 does not change the exponent of @xmath21 , we have @xmath57 and thus @xmath58 .",

    "fitting yields @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , hence a very good approximation is ( see ) @xmath83 this shows that the relatively simple estimate above for the slope is only 12% off .      here",
    "we explore the point process of users as seen from a base station .",
    "formally , the point process of _ interfering _ users at the typical bs , assumed at @xmath42 , is @xmath84 since @xmath85 is only isotropic but not stationary , we need to specify that the pcf of interest is the one with respect to the origin , hence we define @xmath86 and , as before , @xmath87 . again we can focus on @xmath88 due to scale - invariance .",
    "[ lem : m1bs ] when @xmath30 is a uniform ppp of intensity @xmath1 , @xmath89    let @xmath90 , which is the distance of the bs at @xmath42 to its nearest neighbor @xmath43 . if @xmath91 , then the nearest interfering user is farther than @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath92 , then the user in bs @xmath43 s cell has probability @xmath93 to be within distance @xmath21 of @xmath42 , where @xmath94 is the area of the cell of @xmath43 .",
    "we have @xmath95 since @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath94 does not depend on @xmath21 , so @xmath98 , @xmath62 .",
    "as in the previous case , we can obtain an estimate for the pre - constant . when approximating @xmath99 , we need to take into account that @xmath94 is not the area of the typical cell but that of a cell whose bs is very close to a boundary . intuitively , the mean area of such a skewed cell is about half the mean area of the typical cell .",
    "detailed simulations confirm that this is indeed the case .",
    "in fact , if @xmath100 is the distance to the nearest neighbor , @xmath101 , for small @xmath100 , see . hence ,",
    "assuming the shape of the cell is the same as that of the typical cell , we can use with an adjusted mean and obtain @xmath102 .    combining the results for @xmath103 and @xmath99",
    ", we obtain @xmath104 and thus , for small @xmath21 , @xmath105 .",
    "hence we expect @xmath106 to be near - exact for small @xmath21 and a decent approximation for all @xmath21 .    in view of lemma [ lem : m1bs ] and the simulation result in , the natural prototype function here is of the form @xmath107 fitting yields @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . the best exponential fit , also obtained numerically , is @xmath111      the mean interference at the typical user from other users is @xmath112 @xcite . if @xmath58 , a necessary condition for the mean interference to be finite is @xmath113 , since @xmath114 for @xmath115 is finite only if @xmath113 .",
    "hence lemma [ lem : m1 ] implies that the mean interference is finite only for @xmath116 . for the mean interference at a base station ( uplink ) , @xmath117 , @xmath62 , thus the range of @xmath118 that results in finite mean",
    "interference is @xmath119 . in this case , for @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath122 , if the approximation in @xcite was used for heavily loaded networks , it would underestimate the mean interference by more than a factor @xmath123 .",
    "here we consider the user point process @xmath31 of general intensity @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to find a ppp @xmath124 such that for all @xmath125 , @xmath126 expanding both the left and right sides , using campbell s theorem on the right and its palm version ( where the reduced second factorial moment measure replaces the intensity measure @xcite ) on the left , the identity can be formulated as @xmath127 which is satisfied if we set the intensity function to @xmath128 the same idea was put forth in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* assumption 1 ) . in principle",
    "any point process with intensity function @xmath129 could be used , but the ppp is a natural choice due its unparalleled tractability .",
    "accordingly , for the user point process , @xmath130 or , for a coarser but simpler approximation , @xmath131    from the perspective of the typical bs , we replace @xmath132 by @xmath133 in and set @xmath134      the @xmath135-ginibre point process with retention probability @xmath135 and subsequent rescaling to preserve the intensity . ]",
    "@xcite has the pcf @xmath136 , which is strikingly similar to that of the interfering users at a base station .",
    "hence the @xmath135-ginibre process with @xmath137 , denoted by @xmath138 , has @xmath139 .",
    "since the ginibre process also models the repulsion between users , not just the repulsion between the bs and the users , it is a more accurate approximation than the ppp , albeit at reduced tractability .",
    "it also provides an efficient way of simulating @xmath85 especially if only the distances matter , since the moduli of the points of the ginibre process are equal in distribution to a set of independent gamma random variables ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii.a ) .",
    "if the ginibre process was used to approximate the user process @xmath31 ( well aware that the slope at @xmath79 does not match ) , the best fit is obtained for @xmath140 which , remarkably , is exactly the same approximation as for @xmath85 . as seen in ,",
    "the gap to the true curve here is bigger , but the @xmath135-ginibre process still is a decent substitute for the user point process of type i. the ginibre approximation also shows that independent thinning does not affect the pcfs @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "let @xmath141 . from the resemblance",
    "to the ginibre process and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop .  1 ) ,",
    "an educated guess for the nearest - neighbor distance distribution @xmath142 is that @xmath143 follows a gamma distribution with parameters @xmath123 and @xmath144 , since simulation results indicate @xmath145 .",
    "it follows that @xmath146 which results in a mean @xmath147 , in perfect agreement with simulation results . the same approximation can be used also for the distribution of the nearest interfering user distance @xmath148 .",
    "since the typical user resides in the typical cell , the distance @xmath149 to its serving bs is not the standard rayleigh distribution with mean @xmath150 ( for @xmath88 ) , but a similarly - shaped distribution with ( empirical ) mean @xmath151 , corresponding to a correction factor @xmath152 in the density .",
    "hence a very good approximation for general @xmath1 is @xmath153      for the stationary square lattice @xmath154 ^ 2)+\\mathbb{z}^2 $ ] , the pcf of the user process @xmath31 satisfies @xmath155    following the same procedure as for the poisson case , we can determine the behavior of @xmath0 for small @xmath21 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath156 , @xmath62 .",
    "due to the concavity of the pcf , @xmath157 is a good upper bound , and @xmath158 is the corresponding lower bound . both are asymptotically exact .",
