    "more than decade ago it has been discovered that submonolayer coverage of gold stabilizes stepped silicon surfaces , leading to one - dimensional ordering of the surface @xcite .",
    "since then various stepped si surfaces have been extensively studied in relation to expected exotic phenomena , characteristic for systems of reduced dimensionality @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of the most known examples is a gold decorated si(553 ) surface .",
    "the si(553)-au surface consists of si(111 ) terraces @xmath0 } = 1.48 $ ] nm wide and single atomic steps .",
    "the si(553 ) surface normal is tilted from @xmath1 $ ] direction towards @xmath2 $ ] by 12.5@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the properties of this surface have been investigated by number of techniques , including scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite , x - ray diffraction @xcite , and density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "topography of the surface , as measured by stm , features single few nanometers long chains on each terrace , which have been identified as originating from the step edge si atoms .",
    "those chains are observed to have 3.84 periodicity along the chains , i.e. in @xmath4 $ ] direction , which perfectly matches the si lattice constant in this direction .",
    "this is completely different from what is observed on other vicinal si surfaces , like si(335)-au @xcite or si(557)-au @xcite , where chains show periodicity doubling , i.e. stm topography shows maxima along the chains with a period of @xmath5}$ ] .",
    "the periodicity doubling on si(557)-au and si(553)-au surfaces has been explained in terms of the buckling of the step edge si atoms @xcite , according to which every second step edge si atom occupies up ( down ) position .",
    "on si(553)-au surface one occasionally observes periodicity doubling and even oscillations of topography with a period of @xmath6}$ ] @xcite , but this has its origin in defects which force the chains to multiply their periodicity @xcite . in general , the observed chains on si(553)-au surface have the periodicity equal to the si lattice constant in @xmath4 $ ] direction .",
    "the photoemission spectrum of the si(553)-au surface is dominated by two one - dimensional bands ( s@xmath7 and s@xmath8 ) with parabolic dispersions @xcite .",
    "those bands show different dispersions , and as a result cross the fermi energy e@xmath9 at different @xmath10 , i.e. at 1.04 ( 1.07 ) @xmath11 , and at 1.18 - 1.22 ( 1.25 - 1.30 ) @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the less dispersive s@xmath8 band is split by 85 mev , and the splitting has been identified to be a spin splitting induced by the rashba spin - orbit ( so ) interaction @xcite .",
    "similar doublet of the proximal bands is also observed in si(557)-au surface @xcite , which is also spin split due to so interaction @xcite .",
    "the origin of the so split s@xmath8 band comes from the hybridization of the row of au with neighboring si atoms on si(557 ) terrace .",
    "therefore it is also expected that , in the case of si(553)-au surface , situation will be similar .",
    "in fact the spin - split s@xmath8 band has been identified by dft calculations in one of the models of ref .",
    "however other features of calculated band structure for this model disagree with experiment .",
    "the other , more dispersive , band ( s@xmath7 ) does not suffer from the so interaction and is very similar to the band observed in si(335)-au surface @xcite , which also comes from the hybridization of the au row with neighboring si atoms @xcite .",
    "the fact , that in case of si(335)-au surface one does not observe so splitting ( or so is very small ) may come from different widths of terraces , and thus interaction of au row with the step edge si atoms .",
    "early experimental and theoretical investigations assumed au coverage to be 0.24 ml , which is sufficient to form a single row of au atoms per terrace @xcite .",
    "thus it is no wonder that dft calculations did not reproduce photoemission spectra .",
    "recently determined au coverage on si(553 ) surface is 0.48 ml , i.e. two au chains per terrace @xcite .",
    "in fact two au chains per terrace are consistent with the experimentally obtained coverage from x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "however calculated band structure for the structural model deduced from this experiment does not agree with the measured photoemission spectra @xcite .",
    "the widely used coverage of single au chain for si(553 ) surface traces back to the initial assumption of 2/3 ml coverage for si(111)@xmath12-au and to 0.44 ml for si(111)5@xmath132-au reconstructions @xcite . thus in light of this new value of au coverage , most of structural models of si(553)-au surface need to be revised in order to take into account two gold chains per terrace .    the purpose of the present work is to determine a structural model of the si(553)-au surface , which accommodates two gold chains , and calculate corresponding band structure .",
    "the structural model derived from first principles density functional calculations features two au rows running parallel to the step edges and located in the middle of terraces .",
    "the step edge si atoms rebond in order to form honey - comb structure , which is also present in other vicinal si surfaces @xcite .",
    "this structural model is more stable than other structural models with single au chain @xcite and the model deduced from x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "moreover , the calculated band structure for this model perfectly matches the measured arpes spectra , showing two metallic bands associated with the hybridizing au rows with the neighboring si atoms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ details ] the details of calculations are provided . the structural model of si(553)-au surface",
    "is presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ structural ] , while secs .",
    "[ stm ] and [ band ] are devoted to the simulated stm topography images and the electronic band structure , respectively .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] contains some conclusions .",
    "the calculations have been performed using standard pseudopotential density functional theory and linear combination of numerical atomic orbitals as a basis set , as implemented in the siesta code @xcite .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) to dft @xcite , and troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite have been used . in the case of au pseudopotential , the semicore @xmath14 states were included .",
    "a double-@xmath15 polarized ( dzp ) basis set was used for all the atomic species @xcite .",
    "the radii of the orbitals for different species were following ( in a.u . ) : au - 7.20 ( @xmath14 ) , 6.50 ( @xmath16 ) and 5.85 ( @xmath17 ) , si - 7.96 ( @xmath18 ) , 7.98 ( @xmath19 ) and 4.49 ( @xmath20 ) , and h - 7.55 ( @xmath21 ) and 2.94 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a brillouin zone sampling of 12 nonequivalent @xmath23 points , and a real - space grid equivalent to a plane - wave cutoff 100 ry have been employed .",
    "the si(553)-au system has been modeled by four silicon double layers and a vacuum region of 19  .",
    "all the atomic positions were relaxed until the maximum force in any direction was less than 0.04 ev /  , except the bottom layer .",
    "the si atoms in the bottom layer were fixed at their bulk ideal positions and saturated with hydrogen . to avoid artificial stresses ,",
    "the lattice constant of si was fixed at the calculated value , 5.39  .",
    "the total energy calculations of the si(553)-au surface show , like in case of other si surfaces @xcite , that it is energetically favorable for the au atoms to substitute into the top si layer .",
    "the surface energy gain per unit cell is more than 1 ev , as compared to the adsorption of au .",
    "therefore , in the following , i will focus on the structural models of the si(553)-au surface featuring the top si layer atoms substituted by the gold .      since the stm measurements @xcite show that the topography modulation along the chains is equal to the si lattice constant in direction @xmath24 $ ] , it is natural to take for calculations a single unit cell in this direction .",
    "this can be also supported by the fact that the buckling is not observed in si(553)-au surface , in contrast to si(557)-au and si(335)-au surfaces @xcite .",
    "almost all the proposed structural models of si(553)-au surface @xcite feature single au chain per terrace , as the determined au coverage was twice as small as the actual one @xcite .",
    "the only model , accounting for two au chains , was deduced from x - ray diffraction experiment @xcite , and further investigated by dft calculations @xcite . according to that model , the au atoms adsorbed near the si step edges .",
    "however , none of the structural models managed to reproduce the phootemission spectra . moreover ,",
    "systematic investigations of structural models of the si(553)-au surface with proper au coverage ( 2 au atoms per si(553 ) surface unit cell ) show that the more stable models feature the au atoms substituted for the top si layer atoms in the middle of terrace .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the most stable structural model ( single cell model ) of the si(553)-au surface , where the si surface atoms ( si@xmath7-si@xmath25 ) are labeled by numbers 1 - 6 and two gold atoms by au@xmath7 and au@xmath8 .",
    "+    this model is energetically more favorable than the most stable si(553)-au model with single au row @xcite , and the calculated surface energy is 16.45 mev / @xmath26 lower in the au - rich limit @xcite . some of the other models , in which au atoms occupy various top layer si positions , from si@xmath7 to si@xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for labeling ) , have slightly higher energies .",
    "the differences are usually in the range of a few mev / @xmath26 , and the next best structural model , in which the au@xmath8 occupies the si@xmath8 position , has energy only 3.48 mev / @xmath26 higher .",
    "the surface energies of the most stable structural models referred to the most stable model with single au row , are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".[tab1 ] the relative surface energies of most stable structural models of si(553)-au structure .",
    "the energies are referred to the most stable model with single au row . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although the energy differences between various models listed in table [ tab1 ] are rather small , there are other arguments supporting the model shown in fig .",
    "first one is that the model has the lowest surface energy .",
    "second one concerns the honey - comb ( hc ) chain .",
    "it is widely accepted that the structural models of au decorated vicinal si surfaces should posses the honey - comb chain at the step edges .",
    "the main feature of hc structure is the presence of a true double bond between si@xmath8 and si@xmath27 atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which is responsible for stability of the hc chain @xcite .",
    "however , none of the models , presented in table [ tab1 ] , features the hc chain at the step edge , except the present best stable model , shown in fig .",
    "third argument , concerning the band structure , also supports the present most stable model .",
    "the calculated band structure reproduces the photoemission spectra of refs .",
    "@xcite reasonably well .",
    "the other models , which have slightly relative higher surface energies disagree with the arpes spectra . in particular they do not give correct behavior of bands near the fermi energy . this will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ band ] .",
    "it is known that other au decorated vicinal si surfaces , like si(557)-au or si(335)-au , show the buckling of the step edge si atoms @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself in stm topography images as the periodicity doubling along the chains .",
    "since the periodicity of the slab in @xmath24 $ ] direction taken for calculations is equal to the si lattice constant in this direction , all the models discussed above do not take into account the possibility of the buckling at step edge , by definition .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to check if the doubling of the unit cell in @xmath24 $ ] direction will leave the present model of the si(553)-au surface unchanged .",
    "doubling the unit cell along the step edges , i.e. in @xmath24 $ ] direction , leaves almost all the structural models of the previous subsection unchanged .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the models listed in table [ tab1 ] have again the lowest surface energies .",
    "it seems that the si(553)-au surface prefers the symmetrical arrangement of au atoms in neighboring surface unit cells .",
    "the models with asymmetrically arranged au atoms have much higher surface energies .",
    "what is interesting , none of the most stable structural models leads to the buckling of the step edge si atoms , in full agreement with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "thus one can assume that the single cell model ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , i.e. the model with gold atoms in positions au@xmath7 and au@xmath8 , is a good candidate for structural model of the si(553)-au surface .",
    "however , a more detailed inspection shows that this is not the case .",
    "it turns out , that there is a model ( double cell model ) , very similar that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which gold as well as si@xmath28 atoms slightly change their positions , leading to dimerization of au atoms in the rows . the corresponding model is shown in fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "+    the dimerization of the au atoms further lowers the surface energy .",
    "the energy gain is 13.73 mev / @xmath26 , as compared to the single cell model .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the local arrangement of the au and si@xmath28 atoms is the same as in recently proposed models of the si(111)5@xmath132-au reconstruction @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dimerization of the au atoms leaves the structure at the step edges unchanged , i.e. there is no buckling at the step edges , so the periodicity along the terraces still is equal to the si lattice constant in @xmath24 $ ] direction .",
    "however , one can notice a sort of horizontal buckling , i.e. the si@xmath28 atoms alternate between left and right positions in the direction perpendicular to the steps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , with distortion @xmath29  .",
    "this fact is reflected in stm topography and band structure , as will be discussed in text sections .",
    "the stm topography data of the si(553)-au surface shows one - dimensional structures , which are interpreted as the step edge si atoms @xcite . both structural models discussed in sec .",
    "[ structural ] support this scenario .",
    "to further check which one of two proposed models , i.e. single cell and double cell models is closer to real model of the si(553)-au surface , the stm simulations within the tersoff - hamann approach @xcite have been performed .",
    "the results of filled and empty state constant current topography calculated for single and double cell models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] represents simulated stm topography of 4@xmath133 nm@xmath26 of the same area of the si(553)-au surface for sample bias u=-1.0 v ( top panel ) and u=+0.5 v ( bottom panel ) , obtained within the single cell model .",
    "as it was mentioned previously , the most visible chain structure is associated with the step edge si atoms .",
    "the modulation of the topography along these chains is equal to the si lattice constant in @xmath24 $ ] direction , in agreement with stm experiments @xcite .",
    "less visible structure , observed at both polarizations , has been identified as due to si@xmath30-au@xmath7 bonds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "similar structure has occasionally been observed in stm experiments @xcite .    the corresponding simulated stm image generated from the double cell model of the si(553)-au surface is shown in fig . [ fig4 ] .",
    "top panel represents filled state ( u=-1.0 v ) , while the bottom one - empty state topography ( u=+0.5 v ) .",
    "similar as in the single cell model ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the modulation of topography along the step edge si chain is equal to @xmath31}$ ] .",
    "as one can notice , the less visible structure in filled state image ( top panel ) coming from the bonding of the si@xmath30 and au@xmath7 atoms , is very similar to that obtained in the single cell model ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , due to the dimerization of the au@xmath7 atoms , the si@xmath30-au@xmath7 bonds are slightly rotated now , which is reflected in the stm image . on the other hand , the empty state topography ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is completely different from that of single cell model .",
    "we observe a sort of zig - zag structure now , which comes from the every second si@xmath28 atom ( closer to the step edge on the same terrace ) , au@xmath7 , si@xmath30 and si@xmath27 atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the bonded si@xmath28 and au@xmath7 atoms appear higher in stm topography image .",
    "this could correspond to the experimentally observed similar structure @xcite .",
    "as we could see , both structural models , giving different topography images , seem to be consistent with the experimental results .",
    "so a question arises , how it is possible that we experimentally observe different topography images , once consistent with the single cell model , and another time , consistent with the double cell model . to be more precise",
    ", the stm topography recorded at the same conditions shows areas of different topographies .",
    "some of the surface areas feature the structure in the middle of terraces with @xmath31}$ ] periodicity , and the other areas show the structures with a periodicity doubling ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite or fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the chain structure associated with the step edge si atoms has always periodicity of the si lattice constant in direction @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the most plausible scenario for such a behavior is that both structures are realized in real si(553)-au surface .",
    "the structure obtained within the single cell calculations appears to be a high temperature phase , while the double cell structure , with lower energy , is a low temperature phase . at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "both structures can be locally realized , as it is evident from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of defects , which could further stabilize one of the phases at intermediate temperatures , can not be omitted .",
    "nevertheless , at very low temperature , only the double cell structure is expected to be observable .",
    "the experimentally measured electronic band structure features two one - dimensional bands ( s@xmath7 and s@xmath8 ) with parabolic dispersions @xcite .",
    "those bands cross the fermi energy e@xmath9 at different @xmath10 , i.e. at 1.07 @xmath11 ( s@xmath7 band ) , and around 1.27 @xmath11 ( s@xmath8 band ) @xcite . the s@xmath8 band , crossing the e@xmath9 near the si(553 ) surface brillouin zone boundary ( @xmath32 @xmath11 is split by 85 mev , and the splitting has its origin in the rashba spin - orbit interaction @xcite . similar doublet of the proximal bands is also observed in si(557)-au surface @xcite , which is also spin split due to so interaction @xcite .",
    "it is expected that , also in the case of the si(553)-au surface , situation will be similar .",
    "indeed , the dft calculations for one of the models of ref .",
    "@xcite , show that s@xmath8 band is spin - split .",
    "however other features of calculated band structure for that model disagree with the experimental data .",
    "therefore it is natural to check the band structure calculated for the present models against the arpes data @xcite .",
    "although the so interaction was not included in the present calculations , so one can not expect to get the doublet of proximal s@xmath8 bands , the other features of the band structure should be reproduced very well , unless none of the proposed models is correct .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the electronic band structure of the single cell model , calculated in the direction @xmath33 $ ] , i.e. parallel to the steps .",
    "a few surface bands are marked with different symbols , reflecting character of the bands .",
    "the band marked with open ( filled ) squares comes from hybridization of the au@xmath7 and si@xmath28 ( au@xmath8 and si@xmath34 ) atoms , while the band marked with open circles comes form the step edge si atoms .",
    "the open and the filled square bands are those bands observed in photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "both bands are metallic and cross the fermi energy at k@xmath35 = 1.00 @xmath11 ( s@xmath7 ) and 1.18 @xmath11 ( s@xmath8 ) , and slightly deviate from the experimentally determined values : 1.04 @xmath11 and 1.18 - 1.22 @xmath11 @xcite or 1.07 @xmath11 and 1.25 - 1.30 @xmath11 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "bottom of the s@xmath7 band ( open squares ) appears to be shifted towards e@xmath9 by 0.4 ev with respect to experimentally determined value of -0.64 ev @xcite .",
    "the band marked with open circles , coming from the step edge si atoms is not observed in photoemission , probably due to matrix elements . in case of other vicinal si surfaces , like si(557)-au or si(335)-au , this band is half - occupied @xcite .",
    "this band is split due to the buckling of the step edges , and as a result we have two bands : one fully occupied , and the other one completely empty . here",
    ", in the case of the si(553)-au surface , situation is different , as there is no buckling now and the band is not split , however due to the presence of additional row of au atoms , this band becomes almost fully occupied .",
    "slightly different band structure one obtains when calculating it for the double cell model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "again , different symbols stand for different surface bands .",
    "similar as previously , the band marked with open ( filled ) squares comes from hybridization of the au@xmath7 and si@xmath28 ( au@xmath8 and si@xmath34 ) atoms , while the bands marked with open and filled circles come form the step edge si atoms .",
    "the open and the filled square bands are those bands observed in photoemission @xcite .",
    "they have similar dispersions as in the case of the single cell model , however the bands cross the fermi energy at different k@xmath35 points , namely at 1.03 @xmath11 ( s@xmath7 ) and 1.22 @xmath11 ( s@xmath8 ) , which are closer to the experimental values , at least those of ref .",
    "what is also important , energy of the bottom of s@xmath7 band coincides now with experimentally determined value , i.e. -0.64 ev @xcite .",
    "the band structure coming from the step edge si atoms is now more complicated .",
    "namely , the open circle band of the single cell model is split now .",
    "this splitting has its origin in the dimerization of the au atoms and lateral buckling , discussed in sec .",
    "[ structural ] .",
    "the band marked with filled ( open ) circles comes from the step edge si atoms which are located closer ( farther ) to the si@xmath28 atoms on neighboring terrace .",
    "similar as in case of the single cell model , both bands are almost fully occupied owing to the presence of the au atoms .",
    "all the above results show that the double cell model is best candidate for a structural model of the si(553)-au surface , as this model is consistent with the stm and arpes data and features the lowest surface energy",
    ". however , it is also possible that the single cell model is locally realized on the si(553)-au surface .",
    "in conclusion , new structural model of the au induced si(553 ) surface has been proposed .",
    "the model accounts for experimentally found value of the au coverage , i.e. 0.48 monolayer , which gives two gold chains per si(553 ) terrace . like the structural models of the other vicinal si surfaces",
    ", the present model features the honey - comb chain . however , there is no buckling at the step edge .",
    "the simulated stm topography images show chain structure , associated with the step edge si atoms .",
    "the calculated band structure shows two metallic one - dimensional bands , coming from the hybridization of au atoms with neighboring si atoms .",
    "the experimentally determined band structure as well as the stm topography are well reproduced within the present model .",

    "<S> a new structural model of au induced si(553 ) surface is proposed . the model accounts for recently experimentally found value of the au coverage , i.e. 0.48 monolayer , which suggests formation of two gold chains on each si(553 ) terrace . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting structural model , like the models of other vicinal si surfaces , features the honey - comb chain , but there is no buckling at step edge , which is observed on si(335)-au and si(557)-au surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the present model is more stable than the models with single au chain only , and agrees very well with existing experimental data . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> calculated band structure , featuring two metallic bands coming from hybridization of the gold in both chains with neighboring si atoms , perfectly matches the photoemission data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , theoretical scanning tunneling microscopy topography remains in excellent agreement with the experiment . </S>"
