    "a partially rectangular domain @xmath0 is a compact riemannian 2-manifold , either closed or with boundary , that contains a flat rectangle or cylinder , in the sense that @xmath0 can be decomposed @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a rectangle , @xmath6_x \\times [ -\\beta , \\beta]_y$ ] ( with @xmath7 identified in the case of a cylinder ) carrying the flat metric @xmath8 , and such that @xmath9 .",
    "the main result of this paper is that partially rectangular domains @xmath0 are usually not que ( see theorem  [ ae ] ) .",
    "this is primarily of interest in the case that @xmath0 has ergodic billiard flow ; examples include the bunimovich stadium , the sinai billiard , and donnelly s surfaces @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  see figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "ergodicity implies that these domains are _ quantum ergodic _ by a theorem of grard - leichtnam @xcite and zelditch - zworski @xcite , generalizing work of schnirelman @xcite , zelditch @xcite and colin de verdire @xcite in the boundaryless case .",
    "quantum ergodicity is a statement about the eigenfunctions @xmath10 of the positive laplacian @xmath11 associated to the metric on @xmath0 , where we assume that the dirichlet or neumann boundary condition is specified if @xmath0 has boundary .",
    "the operator @xmath11 has a realization as a self - adjoint operator on @xmath12 and has discrete spectrum @xmath13 and corresponding orthonormal real eigenfunctions @xmath10 , unique up to orthogonal transformations in each eigenspace .",
    "the statement that @xmath11 is quantum ergodic is the statement that there exists a density one set @xmath14 of natural numbers such that the subsequence @xmath15 of eigenfunctions has the following equidistribution property : for each semiclassical pseudodifferential operator @xmath16 , properly supported in the interior of @xmath0 , we have @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the length scale corresponding to @xmath10 , @xmath19 is the cosphere bundle of @xmath0 ( the bundle of unit cotangent vectors ) , and @xmath20 denotes the measure of @xmath19 with respect to the natural measure induced by liouville measure on @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , this holds when @xmath16 is multiplication by a smooth function @xmath22 supported in the interior @xmath23 of @xmath0 . in that case , reads @xmath24 which implies that the probability measures @xmath25 tend weakly to uniform measure on @xmath0 ( for @xmath26 ) ; the condition is a finer version of this statement that can be interpreted as equidistribution of the @xmath10 , @xmath26 in phase space . _",
    "quantum unique ergodicity _ ( que ) is the stronger property that holds for the full sequence of eigenfunctions , i.e. that @xmath14 can be taken to be @xmath27 .",
    "these properties can also be expressed in terms of quantum limits , or semiclassical measures .",
    "these are measures on @xmath21 obtained as weak limits of subsequences of the measures @xmath28 which act on compactly supported functions on @xmath29 according to @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a semiclassical quantization of the symbol @xmath32 .",
    "quantum ergodicity then is the statement that for a density one sequence @xmath14 of integers , the sequence @xmath28 converges weakly to uniform measure on @xmath19 , and que the same property with @xmath33 .",
    "there are rather few results , either positive or negative , on quantum unique ergodicity .",

    ", @xcite showed that certain quantized cat maps on the torus are non - que .",
    "in related work , anantharaman @xcite has shown that quantum limits on a closed , negatively curved manifold have positive entropy , which rules out quantum limits supported on a finite number of periodic geodesics .",
    "up till now there have been no billiard systems rigorously proved to be either que or non - que .",
    "the results of the present paper are based crucially on the fact that partially rectangular domains @xmath0 may be considered part of a one - parameter family @xmath1 where we fix the height @xmath34 of the rectangle and vary the length @xmath35 . here",

    "this is proved first in the simple setting of the stadium billiard with the dirichlet boundary condition . in the appendix , which is joint work with luc hillairet",
    ", we show how to obtain the result for any partially rectangular domain .",
    "[ f1 ]     the proof is based on the original argument of heller and oconnor @xcite as refined by zelditch @xcite , using ` bouncing ball ' quasimodes . their argument shows that que fails provided that one can find a subsequence of intervals of the form @xmath38 $ ] , for arbitrary fixed @xmath39 , such that the number of eigenvalues in this interval is bounded uniformly as @xmath40 along this subsequence . note that in two dimensions , the expected number of eigenvalues in the interval @xmath41 $ ] is independent of @xmath42 , so this is a very plausible condition .",

    "the @xmath54 are so - called ` bouncing ball ' quasimodes ; they concentrate semiclassically as @xmath40 onto a subset of the bouncing ball trajectories , which are the periodic trajectories that bounce vertically ( i.e. with @xmath55 fixed ) between the horizontal sides of the rectangle @xmath5 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath56 , uniformly in @xmath45 .",

    "then the sequence @xmath67 of eigenfunctions has positive mass along bouncing ball trajectories , and in particular is not equidistributed . to see this , given any @xmath68 ,",
    "let @xmath69 be a self - adjoint semiclassical pseudodifferential operator , properly supported in the rectangle in both variables , so that @xmath70 and so that @xmath71 for sufficiently large @xmath45 .",
    "then , we can compute @xmath72 this is bounded away from zero for small @xmath73 . by choosing a sequence of operators @xmath69 such that @xmath74 and such that the support of the symbol of @xmath69 shrinks to the set of bouncing ball covectors ( i.e. multiples of @xmath75 supported in the rectangle ) , we see that the mass of any quantum limit obtained by subsequences of the @xmath64 must have mass at least @xmath76 on the bouncing ball trajectories .",
    "the missing step in this argument , supplied by the present paper ( at least for a large measure set in the parameter @xmath2 ) , is to show that there are indeed sequences @xmath77 so that holds .",
    "burq and zworski @xcite have shown that @xmath78 quasimodes , unlike @xmath79 quasimodes , can not concentrate asymptotically _ strictly _ inside the rectangle @xmath6 \\times [ -\\beta , \\beta]$ ] , in the sense that they can not concentrate in subrectangles @xmath80 $ ] with @xmath81 a strict closed subinterval of @xmath82 $ ] .",

    "the heller - oconnor - zelditch argument from the introduction then gives a contradiction to the que assumption .",
    "rather than employing such a contradiction argument , however , we use a slightly more elaborate direct approach , which yields more information .",
    "we begin by dividing the interval @xmath107 $ ] into two sets @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the set of @xmath2 such that @xmath142 where @xmath143 is defined in , and @xmath144 is the complement ( i.e. where the lim inf above is positive ) .    first , consider any @xmath145 .",
    "consider the semiclassical measures @xmath146 on the unit ball bundle of @xmath94 studied in @xcite .",
    "the relation implies that there exists a @xmath146 which vanishes on the curved sides of the stadium .",
    "such a @xmath146 can not have mass on the boundary of the unit ball bundle , since the straight part of the boundary is non - strictly gliding @xcite .",
    "the relation between quantum limits @xmath147 and boundary measures @xmath146 in theorem 2.3 of @xcite then shows that there exists a quantum limit @xmath147 supported on ( interior ) rays that do not meet the curved sides of the stadium .",
    "the only such trajectories are the bouncing ball trajectories .",
    "therefore , every @xmath145 satisfies the conditions of the theorem .",

    "to finish the proof we show that there is a set of measure at least @xmath189 that is contained in @xmath186 for infinitely many @xmath45 . that is , defining @xmath190 we show that @xmath191 . to show this consider the sets @xmath192",
    "since @xmath193 and @xmath194 is a decreasing family of sets , it suffices to show that @xmath195 for every @xmath196 . to see this , on one hand",
    ", we have @xmath197 on the other hand , by the definition of @xmath198 , @xmath199 and putting these together we obtain @xmath200 as required .",
    "we have now shown that for a subset of @xmath144 of measure at least @xmath189 , there is a sequence of integers @xmath60 ( depending on @xmath2 ) for which holds , and therefore the mass statement in theorem  [ strong ] holds for all such @xmath2 using the argument from the introduction .",
    "thus the conclusion of theorem  [ strong ] holds for all @xmath145 and all @xmath148 except on a set of measure at most @xmath201 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "in this appendix , we show how the proof above for the stadium domain can be adapted to partially rectangular domains @xmath1 , thereby proving theorem  [ ae ] in full generality .",
