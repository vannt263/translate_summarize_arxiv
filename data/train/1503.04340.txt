    "the first one preserves for all dimensions the structure of the hamiltonian ( [ hamqed ] ) , including the coupling of the matter fields with a _ unitary _ gauge operator . the second approach , which has been followed in the formulation of the qlm @xcite , consists in preserving the cr between field operators , ( [ gaugecomm ] ) in particular . since in quantum mechanics one is used to think in terms of commutators , the latter approach has so far appeared more natural .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure focuses on the invariance with respect to the u(1 ) group of local transformations , at the expenses of the structure of the hopping term , that no longer involves a unitary comparator ( minimal coupling prescription ) .",
    "we shall rather insist on the unitarity of the comparator thereby obtaining a _ bona fide _ lattice _",

    "the ladder operators @xmath16 permute the electric field basis states on a circle , and transitions between neighboring states all occur with the same amplitude .",

    "since each @xmath82 acts nontrivially on site @xmath5 and the adjacent links , the physical subspace ( [ physpace ] ) is spanned by the reference basis states satisfying @xmath83 if an even site with @xmath84 is empty , the eigenvalues of @xmath50 in neighboring links must be equal , while if it is occupied , they will be related by @xmath85 .",
    "on the other hand , in odd sites with @xmath86 , the eigenvalues of @xmath50 are equal if the site is occupied , while they are related by @xmath87 otherwise .",
    "this is in agreement with dirac s picture in which the absence of a particle in a negative - energy site is equivalent to the presence of an antiparticle .",
