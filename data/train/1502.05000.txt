    "they provide evidence of the accelerating expansion of universe and hence for the existence of the mysterious dark energy which drives this process .",
    "there is no doubt that these data are modifying the classical description of gravitation , general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "we will engage other theories in modifying our gr to finally understand this epoch .",
    "universe may be accelerating due to matter and geometry of the full action .",
    "two contrasting methods for accelerating scenario have been identified . at the first candidate",
    ", an exotic matter fluid was used in the full action of theory to realize a variety of accelerating and decelerating phases .",
    "they had to prove that gr respond to cosmological needs in a world of accelerating expansion that we observed earlier . at the next stage ,",
    "a geometrical modification was used in the action to study a variety of accelerating and decelerating epochs @xcite-@xcite ) . as individuals ,",
    "there are things we can perform to improve the situation , firstly as geometrical modifications and secondly as fluids .",
    "firstly there is the belief that the buchdahl was the founder of the @xmath0 modified gravity @xcite . a model is proposed to explore the viable range of parameters of cosmological background due to replacing the ricci scalar @xmath7 by an arbitrary function @xmath0 . proposed action by nonlinear higher terms",
    "should be applied to the large scale . among the proposed models it has been considered that universe expansion caused in the late time where low curvature corrections were formed as space time",
    "were filled .",
    "similar difficulties may apply to the higher order corrections as gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term , @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , in four dimensional einstein - hilbert action , these gb terms have no contribution if they appear in non - minimally coupled form .",
    "the reason backs to the topology and topological invariants .",
    "coupling of gb term to matter fields provides more dynamical features than before . in comparison to @xmath0 ,",
    "the modified gb gravity was proposed to be the @xmath9 gravity as model for dark energy in @xcite .",
    "several interesting cosmological features of this type modified gravity were studied @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the most important motivations of gb gravity is that it arises naturally from string theory .",
    "also , it appears as a non - minimally coupling term to higher order scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the list of possible modifications is not limited upto the above mentioned models .",
    "the non - local models are also so interesting theories and enough popular as modified gravities .",

    "these mass densities that are localized then immediately collapse , releasing thermodynamics that can cause a hydrodynamic pressure impose on the mass distribution . following the collapse of the matter distribution , mass transformed itself into a compact star .",
    "the compact star has a finite size and a huge amount of mass @xcite .",
    "it was an open competition between different massive objects that enabled the neutron star carriers the opportunity to exist in the space time .",
    "the neutron star has very strong surface gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "we can detect these massive objects by looking at the doppler shift in spectral lines emitted by atoms in the surface .",

    "may be studied .",
    "not much gravity on the earth , you can find more on the compact star @xmath12 ! the field of force associated with compact star have both electric and magnetic components and contains a definite amount of electromagnetic energy .",
    "this means there is a greater difference between individual plants which makes the species and neutron stars . for some basic parameters , for example emission above - ground level , electromagnetic effects were stronger than thermodynamic effects .",
    "it was shown that the thermodynamic parameters , pressure @xmath1 , energy density @xmath2 , the mass function @xmath13 and radius @xmath7 are related according to a set of `` state '' equations , called as tov equations in gr @xcite-@xcite .",
