    "it has long been known that the infrared behavour of the propagator in the theory with massless particle as photon is determined by low - energy theorem or renormalization group analysis[1,2,3].the answer is known as @xmath2    near @xmath3where @xmath4 is a covariant gauge fixing parameter and @xmath5 is a fine structure constant.@xmath6 is an anomalous dimension of wave function renormalization constant.this formula is valid in the infrared region.but the super renormalizable model as qed@xmath7 suggests the validity of the above type of formula in all region of momentum.if we sum all ladder type diagrams which is dominant in the infrared we obtain the similar form of the propagator with dimensionless coupling constant @xmath8including vacuum polarization the infrared divergences turns out to be soft .",
    "the spectral representation of the propagator is given[1 ] @xmath9    if the intermediate states contain massless particle as photon there are infrared divergences.in the quenched approximation the state @xmath10 stands for a fermion and arbitrary numbers of photons,@xmath11 we have the solution for the spectral function @xmath12 which is written symbolically@xmath13 here the notations @xmath14 have been introduced to show the phase space of each photons.to evaluate the contribution of soft photons ,",
    "first we consider the situation when only the @xmath15-th photon is soft.we define the matrix element @xmath16 we consider @xmath17 for @xmath18continue off the photon mass shell @xmath19 @xmath17 satisfies ward - takahashi - identity@xmath20 formal proof of ward - takahahsi - identity is provided with lsz reduction formula and subsidary condition for photon[4 ] @xmath21 by the low - energy theorem the fermion pole term in @xmath22 is dominant for the infrared singularity in @xmath23.these arise from diagrams in which the soft - photon line with momentum @xmath23 and the incoming fermion line can be separated from the remainder of the diagram by cutting a single fermion line.inclusion of regular terms and their contribution to ward - identities are given for the scalar case[1].hereafter we consider the one - photon matrix element @xmath24 which is given in [ 1,4,5]@xmath25 where @xmath26 is a four component free particle spinor with positive energy.if we sum infinite numbers of photon in the final state as in ( 5),assuming pole dominance for @xmath23 we have a simplest solution to @xmath17 in ( 9 ) @xmath27 from this relation we obtain the @xmath15-photon matrix element @xmath17 as the direct products of @xmath24@xmath28 in this way we have an approximate solution of ( 5 ) by exponentiation of the one - photon matrix element @xmath29@xmath30 the fermion propagator is written explicitly in the following form in quenched case@xmath31),\\nonumber\\\\ \\left\\vert x\\right\\vert   &   = \\sqrt{-x^{2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the function @xmath32 is evaluated with exponential cut - off for quenched case[1,3,4 ] @xmath33 where we find mass shift @xmath34here we apply the spectral function of dressed photon in the landau gauge[2,6 ] to evaluate the unquenched fermion proagator .",
    "@xmath35 in this case wave function renormalization is given@xmath36 we have an improved @xmath32 @xmath37 here linear divergent term is regularized by cut - off @xmath38the fermion propagator with @xmath1 flavours in position space is modified to @xmath39@xmath40      it is known@xmath41 if we assume the spectral density for position dependent mass which makes fermion fat@xmath42 we get the propagator in euclid space @xmath43@xmath44    explicit evaluation of @xmath45 is not easy.in fig.1 and fig.2 we see the profile of the scalar part of the propagator in position and momentum space respectively for @xmath46 and quenched linear approximation to dyson - schwinger equation[7].@xmath47 effects of position dependent mass with vacuum polarization correction can be seen by comparison with the quenched linear approximation .",
    "we have the renormalization constant and bare mass in our approximation from ( 22 ) @xmath48@xmath49 there is no pole and it shows the confinement for @xmath50.order parameter @xmath51 is given in position space directly from ( 20)@xmath52 from the above equation we see that @xmath51 @xmath53 and finite only if @xmath54    here we consider the condition of @xmath46 is satisfied or not.in our approximation there is not a definite way to determine physical mass @xmath55the linear approximation to the dyson - schwinger equation in quenched case leads @xmath46[7].in our case for vanishing bare mass physical mass is assumed to be @xmath56 the condition is approximately satisfied.if we add small but finite bare mass it may be satisfied.for @xmath57 case we have@xmath58 , which is the same order as in ref[8,9 ] .",
