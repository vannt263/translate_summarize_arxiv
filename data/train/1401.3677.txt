    "the spatial distribution of transmitters is critical in determining the power of the received signals and the mutual interference , and hence the performance , of a wireless network . as a consequence , stochastic geometry models for wireless networks",
    "have recently received widespread attention since they capture the irregularity and variability of the node configurations found in real networks and provide theoretical insights ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , most works that use such stochastic geometry models for wireless networks assume , due to its tractability , that nodes are distributed according to the poisson point process ( ppp ) , which means the wireless nodes are located independently of each other .",
    "however , in many actual wireless networks , node locations are spatially correlated , i.e. , there exists repulsion ( or attraction ) between nodes , which means that the node locations of a real deployment usually appear to form a more regular ( or more clustered ) point pattern than the ppp . in this paper , we focus on networks that are more regular than the ppp . in order to model such networks more accurately , _",
    "hard - core _ or _ soft - core _ processes that account for the repulsion between nodes are required .",
    "it is well recognized that point processes like the matrn hard - core process ( mhcp ) , the strauss process and the perturbed lattice are more realistic point process models than the ppp and the hexagonal grid models since they can capture the spatial characteristics of the actual network deployments better @xcite .",
    "more importantly , through fitting , these point processes may have nearly the same characteristics as the real deployment of network nodes @xcite .",
    "however , the main problem with these point processes is their limited analytical tractability , which makes it difficult to analyze the properties of these repulsive point processes , thus limiting their applications in wireless networks .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the _ ginibre point process _",
    "( gpp ) as a model for wireless networks whose nodes exhibit repulsion .",
    "the gpp belongs to the class of determinantal point processes ( dpps ) @xcite and thus is a soft - core model .",
    "it is less regular than the lattice but more regular than the ppp .",
    "specifically , we focus on a more general point process denoted as @xmath0-gpp , @xmath1 , which is a thinned and re - scaled gpp .",
    "it is the point process obtained by retaining , independently and with probability @xmath0 , each point of the gpp and then applying the homothety of ratio @xmath2 to the remaining points in order to maintain the original intensity of the gpp .",
    "note that the @xmath3-gpp is the gpp and that the @xmath0-gpp converges weakly to the ppp of the same intensity as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in other words , the family of @xmath0-gpps generalizes the gpp and also includes the ppp as a limiting case .",
    "intuitively , we can always find a @xmath0 of the @xmath0-gpp to model those real network deployments with repulsion accurately as long as they are not more regular than the gpp . in view of this",
    ", we fit the @xmath0-gpps to the base station ( bs ) locations in real cellular networks obtained from a public database .",
    "another attractive feature of the gpp is that it has some critical properties ( in particular , the form of its moment densities and its palm distribution ) that other soft - core processes do not share , which enables us to obtain expressions or bounds of important performance metrics in wireless networks .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to introduce and promote the gpp as a model for wireless networks where nodes exhibit repulsion .",
    "the gpp not only captures the geometric characteristics of real networks but also is fairly tractable analytically , in contrast to other repulsive point process models .    specifically , we first derive some classical statistics , such as the @xmath5 function , the @xmath6 function and the @xmath7 function , the distribution of each point s modulus and the palm measure for the @xmath0-gpps . and",
    "then , to show that the model leads to tractable results in several cases of interest , we analyze the mean and variance of the interference using two different approaches : one is with the aid of the palm measure and the other is to use the reduced second moment measure .",
    "we also provide comparisons of the mean interference between the @xmath0-gpps and other common point processes .",
    "further , based on the mean and variance of the interference , we provide approximations of the interference distribution using three known probability density functions , the gamma distribution , the inverse gaussian distribution , and the inverse gamma distribution .",
    "as an application to cellular systems , we derive a computable representation for the coverage probability in cellular networks  the probability that the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) for a mobile user achieves a target threshold . to show that the model is indeed relevant for cellular systems",
    ", we fit the @xmath0-gpps to the bs locations in real cellular networks obtained from a public database .",
    "the fitting results demonstrate that the fitted @xmath0-gpp has nearly the same coverage properties as the given point set and thus , in terms of coverage probability , it can closely model the deployment of actual bss .",
    "we also find that the fitted value of @xmath0 is close to 1 for urban regions and relatively small ( between 0.2 and 0.4 ) for rural regions , which means the nodes in actual cellular networks are less regular than the gpp and thus can always be modeled by a @xmath0-gpp through tuning the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-gpp is a very useful and accurate point process model for most repulsive wireless networks , especially for cellular networks .",
    "stochastic geometry models have been successfully applied to model and analyze wireless networks in the last two decades since they not only capture the topological randomness in the network geometry but also lead to tractable analytical results @xcite .",
    "the ppp is by far the most popular point process used in the literature because of its tractability .",
    "models based on the ppp have been used for a variety of networks , including cellular networks , mobile ad hoc networks , cognitive radio networks , and wireless sensor networks , and the performance of ppp - based networks is well characterized and well understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the ppp model provides many useful theoretical results , the independence of the node locations makes the ppp a dubious model for actual network deployments where the wireless nodes appear spatially negatively correlated , i.e. , where the nodes exhibit repulsion .",
    "hence , point processes that consider the spatial correlations , such as the mhcp and the strauss process , have been explored recently since they can better capture the spatial distribution of the network nodes in real deployments @xcite .",
    "however , their limited tractability impedes further applications in wireless networks and leaves many challenges to be addressed .",
    "the gpp , one of the main examples of determinantal point processes on the complex plane , has recently been proposed as a model for cellular networks in the technical report @xcite .",
    "although there is a vast body of research on gpps used to model random phenomena with repulsion , no refereed article has used the gpp as a model for wireless networks . only two ( non - refereed ) works focus on this model : @xcite proposes a stochastic geometry model of cellular networks according to the gpp and derives the coverage probability and its asymptotics as the sinr threshold becomes large but does not consider the more general case of the @xmath0-gpp ; @xcite investigates the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the interference using different fading random variables in wireless networks , where nodes are distributed according to the @xmath0-gpp . different from them",
    ", we mainly focus on the mean and variance of the interference in @xmath0-ginibre wireless networks , the coverage , and the fitting to real data .",
    "since the family of @xmath0-gpps constitutes an intermediate class between the ppp ( fully random ) and the gpp ( relatively regular ) , it is intuitive that we can use the @xmath0-gpp to model a large class of actual wireless networks by tuning the parameter @xmath0 .",

    "readers are referred to @xcite for further details .",

    "it can be seen that except for the ppp , the mean interferences of the point processes are not proportional to @xmath212 , which means the mean interferences of soft - core and hard - core processes are not proportional to their intensities . from ( [ 29 ] ) , whether the mean interference is proportional to @xmath212 depends on whether the reduced second measure ( i.e. , the expected number of the interfering sources within distance @xmath87 of the origin ) is proportional to @xmath212 . for the gpp and the mhcp ,",
    "their reduced second measures are not proportional to the intensity ; while for the ppp , where @xmath241 , its mean interference is proportional to @xmath212 , as shown in the figure .    in the following ,",

    "[ 1 ] , we choose known probability density functions ( pdfs ) to approximate the pdf of the interference for @xmath149 , @xmath239 and @xmath209 .",
    "the three candidate densities are the gamma distribution , the inverse gaussian distribution , and the inverse gamma distribution , given as follows ( * ? ? ? * chap .  5 ) ,    \\(1 ) gamma distribution:@xmath255 @xmath256 with mean @xmath257 and variance @xmath258 ;",

    "we can observe that the empirical pdf around the origin is 0 in both cases , so fitting a pdf whose first derivative at the origin is 0 may give a good fit to the interference distribution for small interference situations .",

    "for the gamma distribution , its first derivative at the origin is 0 when @xmath217 but tends to @xmath265 when @xmath198 .",

    "according to @xcite , the interference distribution of any motion - invariant point process has exponential decay on the origin and an exponential tail due to the rayleigh fading .",
    "however , the gamma distribution has a @xmath266th order of decay at the origin and an exponential tail , which leads to a bad fit for @xmath217 .",

    "modeling the spatial structure of cellular networks is one of the most important applications of the @xmath0-gpps . in this section",

    "the density of each data set is estimated through calculating the total number of points divided by the area of each region .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath0-gpp is then set to the density of the given point sets .",
    "based on the estimated density , we fit the @xmath0-gpp to the actual bs deployments with three different metrics , the @xmath6 function , the @xmath7 function and the coverage probability .",
    "the first two are classical statistics in stochastic geometry , while the last one is a key performance metric of cellular networks .",
    "our objective of fitting is to minimize the vertical average squared error between the metrics obtained from the experimental data and those of the @xmath0-gpp .",

    "the empirical coverage probability @xmath288 can be estimated by determining the covered area fraction for @xmath289 . in the following simulations , @xmath288",

    ", we only use the central [ @xmath291 rectangle of the fitting region .",
    "it should be noted that for smaller @xmath196 , most of the interference comes from far - away interferers but in the empirical data , they are not present since the fitting region is finite .",
    "therefore , we add an analytical interference term that represents the mean interference obtained from interferers outside the fitting region . to obtain the curve for the @xmath0-gpp , we focus on the coverage probability of the user located at the origin . instead of using the result in theorem [ cov ] , we exploit the exceptional simplicity of the distribution of the squared moduli ( distances ) of the points and simulate them using the gamma distribution method ( see proposition [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we also evaluate @xmath290 values of the sinr based on the @xmath290 realizations of the squared moduli of the points in @xmath0-gpp .",
    "table [ table 2 ] gives the fitting results of @xmath0 for different @xmath196 in urban and rural regions , which reveals that the urban deployments are fairly regular ( @xmath0 is close to 1 ) but not more regular than the @xmath3-gpp while the rural ones are quite irregular . as the figure shows , the curve of the fitted @xmath0-gpp and the curve of the point set match extremely well .",

    "based on this model , we derived the mean and variance of interference and analyzed their finiteness using two different approaches : one is based on the palm measure of the @xmath0-gpp and the other is based on the reduced second moment density obtained from the kernel of the @xmath0-gpp . for a bounded path - loss law , both the mean and variance of interference are finite when @xmath272 , while for an unbounded path - loss law , the mean interference and the variance are finite on different intervals of @xmath196 . using the analytically obtained mean and variance , we also provided approximations of the interference distribution using three known pdfs , i.e. , the gamma distribution , the inverse gaussian distribution and the inverse gamma distribution . through comparison with the monte - carlo simulations",
    ", we observed that , among the three pdfs , the inverse gamma distribution performs the best fit for @xmath217 and the inverse gaussian distribution provides the best fit for @xmath198 .",
    "besides , we derived a computable integral representation for the coverage probability of the typical mobile user . to demonstrate the accuracy and practicability of the @xmath0-gpp model for wireless networks , we fitted the point process model to publicly available base station data by carefully adjusting the parameter @xmath0 , which controls the degree of repulsion between the points . through fitting by minimizing the vertical average squared error , we found that the fitted @xmath0-gpp has nearly the same coverage probability as the given point set , and thus , in terms of coverage probability , is an accurate model for real deployments of the base stations . through the fitting result of @xmath0",
    ", we found that the urban deployments are fairly regular but not more regular than the @xmath3-gpp , while the rural ones are quite irregular , i.e. , they have smaller @xmath0 than the urban ones , which demonstrates that the @xmath0-gpp is capable of modeling all the actual cellular networks through tuning the parameter @xmath0 .    compared to the ppp , the @xmath0-gpp better captures the spatial distribution of the nodes in a real network deployment ; compared to the mhcp or the strauss process , the @xmath0-gpp provides more theoretical insights .",
