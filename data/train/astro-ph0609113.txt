    "heating by supernovae and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to play important roles in galaxy formation , generating the observed correlation between the bulge mass of a galaxy and the mass of the central supermassive black hole , the upper mass cutoff of galaxies and reheating the gas in galaxies , groups and clusters . in order to reconcile the predictions of the cold dark",
    "matter hierarchical clustering scenario with the observed luminosity function of galaxies and their mass - to - light ratios , it is thought that supernova feedback regulates star formation in galaxies less luminous than about @xmath4 , while agn feedback regulates star formation in more massive galaxies ( e.g. , white & frank 1991 ; bower et al .",
    "2005 ; croton et al .",
    "only type ii supernovae provide a natural feedback mechanism due to the short time delay between the onset of star formation and the first supernova . while type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) can not provide a feedback mechanism that regulates concurrent star formation , sn ia can play a significant role in the fate of gas shed by evolving stars in low - mass galaxies long after star formation ceases .",
    "einstein observations showed that the bulk of the x - ray emission from optically luminous early - type galaxies arises from hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium ( forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) .",
    "a harder x - ray component , more prevalent among low - luminosity early - type galaxies , was detected by asca and assumed to arise from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) due to the old stellar population in these systems ( kim , fabbiano & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "based on the analysis of asca data , white , sarazin & kulkarni ( 2002 ) found that the luminosity of the hard x - ray component was more strongly correlated with the luminosity in globular clusters rather than the total optical luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "chandra , with its superior angular resolution , has resolved populations of point sources in many early - type galaxies ( e.g. , sarazin , irwin & bregman 2000 ; angelini , lowenstein & mushotzky 2001 ; kraft et al . 2001",
    "; blanton , sarazin & irwin 2001 ) and found that 20 to 80% of the point sources reside in globular clusters ( sarazin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "while the hot gas content of x - ray luminous early - type galaxies has been well studied by chandra and previous x - ray telescopes , little is known about the properties of the gas in less luminous early - type galaxies . in low - luminosity early - type galaxies ,",
    "the x - ray emission from lmxbs can exceed the thermal emission from hot gas , so it is imperative that the lmxbs be detected and excised from the analysis of the diffuse emission .",
    "theoretical models concerning the evolution of early - type galaxies show that for typical sn ia rates , early - type galaxies fainter than @xmath5 should possess sn ia driven galactic winds ( e.g. , david , forman & jones 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "in addition to heating by sn ia , agn heating may also expel a significant portion of the gas shed by evolving stars in the shallow potential well of low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "chandra has detected x - ray cavities filled with radio emitting plasma and agn driven shocks in many elliptical galaxies and clusters ( e.g. , mcnamara    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     notes : galaxy name , 1.4  ghz flux ( @xmath6 ) and luminosity ( @xmath7 ) of the central agn .    hole mass and the absolute red magnitude , @xmath8 , found by mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) of @xmath9 , and an average @xmath10 of 2.5 for the galaxies in our sample , we plot the expected agn and sn ia heating rates in fig . 11 against the bolometric luminosity of the hot gas . for comparison , the mechanical power required to generate the observed shocks in ngc4552 ( the upper right hand point in fig .",
    "11 ) is @xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 ( machacek et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is a factor of 2 greater than the rate predicted by best et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but certainly within the uncertainties .",
    "11 indicates that heating by sn ia should dominate the energetics of the gas in early - type galaxies with @xmath13 and that agn heating should dominate in more luminous galaxies .",
    "if heating by sn ia is the dominant mechanism for expelling the gas shed by evolving stars from low - luminosity early - type galaxies , it is a puzzle as to why there is so much scatter in @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see figs . 7 and 11 ) given that supernova heating is essentially a continuous process .",
    "since the gas masses are computed in different apertures ( see table 5 ) , we checked to see if there is a correlation between @xmath14 and aperture size and found none .",
    "while the time - averaged sn ia heating rate shown in fig .",
    "11 exceeds the time - averaged agn heating rate , except for possibly the most luminous galaxies in our sample , the episodic nature of agn outbursts could produce times during which mechanical agn heating exceeds sn ia heating .",
    "thus , the large observed scatter could be a reflection of recent agn activity .",
    "the sound crossing time within the central 10  kpc in these galaxies is approximately @xmath16  yr .",
    "if agn outbursts repeat on a shorter time scale , then the gas will not be able to establish a steady - state wind .",
    "in the very center of the galaxies , heating by sn ia can not be thought of as a continuous process .",
    "for example , within an enclosed stellar mass of @xmath17 , there will only be one sn ia every @xmath18  yr . during this time",
    ", the stars within this region will shed a total of 50  @xmath19 of gas .",
    "if this gas is converted into mechanical energy by the central black hole with an efficiency of 10% , this will produce @xmath20  erg of energy at a rate of @xmath21  erg  s@xmath12 , which is comparable to the sn ia heating rate of an entire galaxy ( see fig .",
    "thus , it could be that the gas in the very center of the    galaxies does not partake in the global sn ia wind , but periodically accretes into the central black hole .",
    "environment can also play a significant role in the gas content of early - type galaxies .",
    "xmm - newton and chandra observations of early - type galaxies in the coma cluster have shown that these galaxies can be either under luminous or over luminous in x - rays relative to field galaxies with comparable optical luminosities due to the competing effects of adiabatic compression , ram pressure stripping and thermal evaporation ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 ; finoguenov & miniati 2004 ; hornschemeier et al . 2005 ) . due to the large distance of the coma cluster ,",
    "these observations were only sensitive to the x - ray properties of luminous early - type galaxies which have massive hydrostatic coronae in regions outside of dense groups or clusters .",
    "low luminosity field galaxies , however , should have strong winds due to the lack of a confining ambient medium .    ngc4552 is located in the densest environment of any of the galaxies in our sample and clearly shows the effects of its environment .",
    "it is located @xmath22 ( a projected distance of 360  kpc ) from the center of the virgo cluster and has the highest gas content and hosts the most radio luminous agn in our sample .",
    "the chandra image shows that ngc 4552 has a leading cold front and a trailing wake of ram pressure stripped gas ( machacek et al . 2005 ) .",
    "based on the pressure jump across the cold front , machacek et al .",
    "estimated that ngc4552 is traveling at 1600  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the average gas density and pressure in ngc4552 derived from the values in table 5 are @xmath23  @xmath24 and @xmath25  kev  @xmath24 . using the results in machacek et al . , the ram pressure of the virgo gas at the leading cold front in ngc4552 is @xmath26  kev  @xmath24 , which is greater than the average thermal pressure of the gas , but less than the central pressure of @xmath27  kev  @xmath24 .",
    "these calculations are in good agreement with the fact that some of the outer gas in ngc452 is being stripped as it falls into the virgo cluster , but not the central gas .",
    "based on the inferred velocity of ngc4552 , it should have traveled approximately 2  mpc during the time it has taken to accumulate its present gas mass .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey data show that the gas in virgo follows a @xmath28 profile ( schindler et al 1999 ) . assuming the virgo gas is isothermal and a radial trajectory for ngc4552",
    ", the thermal pressure of the virgo gas surrounding ngc4552 would have increased by a factor of 20 during this time and the ram pressure by an even greater factor due to the increasing infall velocity .",
    "thus , the ambient pressure during most of this time was sufficient to suppress the formation of a galactic wind , but insufficient to strip the gas from the galaxy .",
    "this would have lead to a substantial increase in gas mass which could have triggered the agn outburst .",
    "we have presented a systematic analysis of chandra observations of 18 low - luminosity early - type galaxies .",
    "emission from lmxbs is very significant in these galaxies and comprises between 30 to 95% of the total 0.5 - 2.0  kev emission .",
    "we find that the combined x - ray luminosity of lmxbs ( resolved plus the power - law component of the unresolved emission ) scales approximately linearly with @xmath29 among the galaxies in our sample with an average @xmath30 ratio comparable to that found in more luminous early - type galaxies . the gas temperature in these galaxies varies from 0.2 to 0.8  kev and roughly follows the observed trend between gas temperature and stellar velocity dispersion among more luminous early - type galaxies , albeit with significant scatter .",
    "the ratio of energy per unit mass in the galaxies to that in the gas , @xmath31 , varies from 0.3 to 1.0 , indicating the presence of significant non - gravitational heating in most of the galaxies .",
    "we do not find any correlation between gas temperature and @xmath15 , unlike more luminous galaxies .",
    "all of the galaxies in our sample are gas poor with @xmath32 , compared to @xmath33 in more luminous early - type galaxies .",
    "the observed gas mass is much less than that expected from the accumulation of stellar mass loss over the lifetime of the galaxies .",
    "based on recent estimates of the stellar mass loss rate in early - type galaxies , the time required to accumulate the observed gas mass is @xmath34  yr . due to the low gas densities , the cooling time of the gas is significantly longer that the replenishment time .",
    "thus , most of the gas shed by evolving stars in these galaxies could not have condensed out of the hot phase and formed stars , and must have been expelled from the galaxies in a wind .",
    "the only exception to this is the most optically luminous galaxy in our sample , ngc4552 .",
    "based on recent estimates of the sn ia rate and mechanical agn heating rate in early - type galaxies , we find that , on average , heating by type ia supernova should dominate over agn heating in galaxies with @xmath13 . using the stellar mass loss rate in athey et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the sn ia rate in cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we find that sn ia are energetically capable of driving galactic winds in low - luminosity early - type galaxies even if the present sn ia rate has been overestimated by a factor of two or the stellar mass loss rate has been underestimated by a factor of two .",
    "we also find that most of the supernova energy must be consumed in lifting the gas out of the gravitational potential well of the galaxies , with little energy converted into thermal or bulk kinetic energy of the gas .",
    "if heating by sn ia were the dominant heating mechanism at all times , it would be difficult to account for the large scatter in gas properties among the galaxies in our sample . even though our calculations show that the time - averaged agn heating rate is less than the supernova heating rate , the episodic nature of agn outbursts could produce periods when agn heating dominates .",
    "one possible explanation for the large scatter in gas properties is that galaxies with very little gas at the present time recently experienced a significant agn outburst that produced a rapid expulsion of the gas .",
    "six of the galaxies in our sample were detected in the nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , however , we do not find any correlations between @xmath14 and radio power .",
    "the lack of a correlation may simply result from the time delay between when the agn reaches its peak radio power and when the gas is expelled from the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the most radio luminous agn in our sample has the largest gas mass .",
    "another possible source for the observed scatter in gas properties among early - type galaxies is variations in the ambient gas pressure surrounding the galaxies which would impact their ability to develop galactic winds .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , mike loewenstein , for his many useful comments .",
    "we also had many useful discussions of our work with ewan osullivan and jan vrtilek .",

    "consider a steady , spherical wind driven by energy injected in association with stellar mass loss . following mathews & baker ( 1971 )",

    "thus , we must also have @xmath79 under the usual assumption that @xmath80 is proportional to the stellar density , this condition requires the mean density to be substantially greater than the local density at the sonic point .",
    "thus , the sonic point must occur well outside the dense stellar core of a typical galaxy .",
    "we can now rewrite the result for @xmath50 as @xmath81_{r =    { r_{\\rm s } } } , \\label{eqn : result}\\ ] ] knowing that all of the factors in the term multiplied by @xmath80 are positive . for a galaxy model with specified potential and stellar mass loss rate , @xmath80",
    ", this expression enables us to determine the specific energy injection rate , @xmath50 , from the location of the sonic point . alternatively ,",
    "if the energy injection rate is known , this equation may be solved to find the location of the sonic point .",
    "in particular , in the limit of large energy input , the sonic point approaches the radius that makes the denominator of the second term vanish , i.e. , that makes the inequality ( [ eqn : large ] ) an indentity .",
    "for the remainder of this discussion , we assume that the stellar mass loss rate is proportional to the stellar density . inside a galaxy ,",
    "the right hand side of the expression for @xmath50 is generally a decreasing function of the sonic radius , @xmath70 , so that the energy input required to drive a wind is minimized when the sonic point occurs at large @xmath36 .",
    "if the stellar density falls rapidly to zero at the edge of the galaxy , @xmath80 falls to zero quickly , while the other terms in this expression are continuous .",
    "thus there is a rapid reduction in the energy required to drive the wind as the sonic point moves across the outer edge of the galaxy . as a result ,",
    "the sonic point occurs close to the edge of the stellar distribution for a range of values of @xmath50 .    beyond the edge of the stars",
    "@xmath82 so that @xmath83 is constant ( from the definition [ eqn : pbdef ] )",
    ". the remaining variable terms in ( [ eqn : result ] ) , @xmath84 $ ] , may increase or decrease with radius , depending on the value of @xmath48 and the distribution of the gravitating matter ( which may extend beyond the stars ) . for @xmath85 ,",
    "these terms reduce to @xmath86 , which is a non - decreasing function of @xmath36 ( since @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the gravitating mass within @xmath36 ) , so that the global minimum of the expression ( [ eqn : result ] ) occurs at a value of @xmath70 close to , or immediately outside the edge of the stellar distribution .",
    "however , the local condition for the sonic point ( [ eqn : result ] ) does not guarantee that the wind solution can be extended to infinity . beyond the edge of the stars , @xmath52 is also constant , and it is evident from equation ( [ eqn : bernoulli ] ) that it necessary that @xmath89 for the wind solution to extend to @xmath90 , an essential requirement for a steady wind .",
    "thus the global minimum value of @xmath50 required for a wind when @xmath91 is @xmath92 similar considerations apply for @xmath93 , except that the energy requirement may now be minimized for @xmath94 in equation ( [ eqn : result ] ) .",
    "thus we arrive at the same global value for @xmath95 .",
    "note that , for @xmath91 , the wind solution with @xmath96 attains a constant mach number beyond the edge of the gravitating matter , rather than having the mach number approach infinity .",
    "for @xmath93 , when the energy requirement is minimized for @xmath97 , the flow would be subsonic everywhere . in that case , the effect of a disturbance at finite @xmath36 is felt throughout the wind flow . in either case , the wind solution is fragile .",
    "this is not surprising for a wind driven with the absolute minimum energy .",
    "it emphasizes that the minimum energy requirement is just that . in reality",
    ", greater energy is required to sustain a wind .    to evaluate @xmath98",
    ", we assume that the gravitational potential has the nfw form , @xmath99 , \\qquad\\qquad { \\rm for\\ } r < ac,\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the scale length , @xmath101 is the scale density and @xmath102 is the concentration parameter .",
    "the stars , hence the mass injection rate , are assumed to have the king model distribution @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the core radius . using the definition ( [ eqn : pbdef ] ) ,",
    "we then get @xmath105 , \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and the stellar distribution is cut off at @xmath108 .",
    "the normalizing factor for the nfw potential , @xmath109 , was determined from the assumption that the maximum rotation speed is related to the line - of - sight velocity dispersion by @xmath110 , giving @xmath111 with @xmath112 . equating the mean density of the halo to @xmath113 times",
    "the critical density then gives the scale length , @xmath114 \\over    \\chi c^3},\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the hubble constant .",
