    "more than three decades ago partridge and peebles ( 1967 ) predicted that galaxies in their first throes of star - formation should be strong emitters in the lyman-@xmath1  line .",
    "their predictions were optimistic , based on converting roughly 2% of gas into stars in @xmath19 years in milky way sized galaxies , which translates into a luminosity of @xmath20 .",
    "these objects are also expected to be common - if all the @xmath21 galaxies have undergone a phase of rapid star - formation one should see a surface density of about @xmath22 ( pritchet 1994 ) .",
    "searches based on these expectations did not detect lyman-@xmath1   emitters ( laes ) .",
    "( see review by pritchet 1994 ; koo & kron 1980 ; pritchet & hartwick 1987 , 1990 ; cowie 1988 ; rhea et al 1989 ; smith et al 1989 ; lowenthal et al 1990 ; wolfe et al 1992 ; de propris et al 1993 ; macchetto et al 1993 ; mller & warren 1993 ; djorgovski & thompson 1992 ; djorgovski , thompson , & smith 1993 ; thompson , djorgovski , & trauger 1992 ; thompson et al 1993 ; thompson , djorgovski , & beckwith 1994 ; thommes et al 1998 . )    only recently have lyman-@xmath1  emitters been observed , albeit at luminosity levels roughly a hundred times lower than the original prediction .",
    "these lyman-@xmath1  emitters have been found from both deep narrow band imaging surveys ( cowie & hu 1998 ; hu , cowie & mcmahon 1998 ; hu , mcmahon , & cowie 1999 ; kudritzki et al 2000 ) , and from deep spectroscopic surveys ( dey et al 1998 ; manning et al 2000 ; but see stern et al 2000 ) .",
    "weak lyman-@xmath1  emitters have also been found through targeted spectroscopy of lyman break objects ( e.g. , steidel et al 1996 , lowenthal et al 1997 ) .",
    "the lower luminosity in the lyman-@xmath1  line may be because of attenuation by dust if chemical enrichment is prompt ; or because the star - forming phase is more protracted ; or because the star - formation happens in smaller units which later merge .",
    "the first two scenarios will give a smaller equivalent width than early predictions , while the last scenario results in low luminosities but high equivalent width .",
    "dust effects are expected to be severe even a small amount of dust can greatly attenuate this line , because it is resonantly scattered",
    ". however , two factors can help the lyman-@xmath1  photons escape .",
    "if lyman-@xmath1  photons are produced in diffuse regions of a clumpy interstellar medium , they can simply scatter off the dense clumps and escape ( neufeld 1991 ) , and some geometries can even lead to an increase in the equivalent width of the line . secondly , energetic winds are seen in low-@xmath23 lyman-@xmath1  emitters ( kunth et al 1998 ) .",
    "these can displace the neutral gas and doppler - shift the peak wavelength of the resonant scattering , thereby reducing the amount of scattering and the path length for interaction with dust .",
    "detailed predictions for luminosities and surface densities of laes using a press - schechter formalism and exploring a range of dust obscuration and star - formation time scales have been explored by haiman and spaans ( 1999 ) , who are able to reproduce the surface densities of laes reported by hu et al ( 1998 ) with a wide range of models . in order to narrow down the range of possibilities and characterize the high redshift lyman-@xmath1  population , better statistics over a wide range of flux and source density",
    "are needed .",
    "an efficient search for lyman-@xmath1  emitters ( and other emission line galaxies ) was started in 1998 using the ccd mosaic camera at the kitt peak national observatory s 4 m mayall telescope .",
    "the mosaic camera has eight @xmath24 chips in a @xmath25 array comprising a @xmath26 field of view .",
    "the final area covered by the lala survey is @xmath27 square - degrees in two mosaic fields centered at 14:25:57 + 35:32 ( 2000.0 ) and 02:05:20 -04:55 ( 2000.0 ) .",
    "five overlapping narrow band filters of width fwhm@xmath28are used .",
    "the central wavelengths are @xmath16 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , giving a total redshift coverage @xmath33 .",
    "this translates into surveyed comoving volume of @xmath34 comoving @xmath35 per field for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "about 70% of the imaging at @xmath39 is complete , and an extension of the survey to @xmath40 is planned . in about 6 hours per filter per field",
    "we are able to achieve line detections of about @xmath41 .",
    "the survey sensitivity varies with seeing .",
    "broadband images of these fields in a custom @xmath42 filter ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and the johnson - cousins @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 bands are being taken as part of the noao deep widefield survey ( jannuzi & dey 1999 ) .",
    "the images were reduced using the mscred package ( valdes & tody 1998 ; valdes 1998 ) in the iraf environment ( tody 1986 , 1993 ) , together with assorted custom iraf scripts .",
    "in addition to standard ccd data reduction steps ( overscan subtraction , bias frame subtraction , and flatfielding ) , it was necessary to remove crosstalk between pairs of ccds sharing readout electronics and to remove a ghost image of the telescope pupil .",
    "astrometry of usno - a catalog stars was used to interpolate all chips and exposures onto a single coordinate grid prior to combining final images .",
    "cosmic ray rejection is of particular importance in a narrowband search for emission line objects .",
    "we therefore identified cosmic rays in individual images using a digital filtering method ( rhoads 2000 ) and additionally applied a sigma clipping algorithm at the image stacking stage .",
    "weights for each exposure were determined using the method of fischer & kochanski ( 1994 ) , which accounts for sky level , transparency , and seeing to optimize the signal to noise level for compact sources in the final image .",
    "catalogs were generated using the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "fluxes were measured in @xmath48 ( 9 pixel ) diameter apertures , and colors were obtained using matched @xmath48 apertures in registered images that had been convolved to yield matched point spread functions .",
    "spectroscopic followup of a cross - section of emission line candidates was obtained with the lris instrument ( oke et al 1995 ) at the keck 10 m telescope on 1999 june 13 ( ut ) .",
    "two dithered exposures of @xmath49 seconds each were obtained through a single multislit mask in good weather .",
    "these data were reduced using a combination of standard iraf onedspec and twodspec tasks together with the homegrown slitmask reduction iraf task `` bogus '' ( stern , bunker , & stanford , private communication ) for reducing lris data .",
    "our imaging data yield numbers of sources as a function of their fluxes in several filters , from which we can construct number densities as a function of magnitudes , colors , and equivalent widths . in order to gracefully handle sources that are not detected in all filters ,",
    "we have chosen to use `` asinh magnitudes '' ( lupton , gunn , & szalay 1999 ) , which are a logarithmic function of flux for well detected sources but approach a linear function of flux for weak or undetected sources .",
    "figure  [ cmdfig ] shows the color - magnitude diagram for the 0  ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath45 filters .",
    "the color scatter achieved for bright sources ( @xmath51 ) is @xmath52 magnitudes ( semi - interquartile range ) .",
    "this includes the true scatter in object colors , and is therefore a firm upper limit on the scatter introduced by any residual systematic error sources , which we expect to be a few percent at worst .    to sharpen our focus on the high redshift lyman-@xmath1  population",
    ", we identify the range of parameter space occupied by known @xmath53 lyman-@xmath1emitters .",
    "these sources have typical observed equivalent widths @xmath54  and line+continuum fluxes @xmath55 ( adjusted to @xmath7 and measured in an @xmath56  filter ) .",
    "we further want to restrict attention to sources with sufficiently reliable detections that the number of false emission line candidates is a small fraction of the total candidate sample .",
    "the data set includes many continuum sources ( @xmath57 in the flux range above ) .",
    "it is expected to contain a few hundred emission line sources , based on earlier source counts from smaller samples ( hu et al 1998 ) and on our own findings ( below ) .",
    "the fraction of continuum sources with measured equivalent widths above some threshold @xmath58 can be calculated as a function of signal to noise level @xmath59 and filter width @xmath60 : the measured equivalent width for a source with no line emission or absorption in the narrowband filter will be @xmath61 .",
    "thus , a false positive becomes an @xmath62 event , where @xmath63 .",
    "our sample would be reasonably safe from contamination with @xmath64 , which would correspond to about 20 false positives in a sample of 14000 sources ; and very safe for @xmath65 , corresponding to @xmath66 false positive in 14000 sources .",
    "we have conservatively chosen detection thresholds @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which gives @xmath69 .",
    "this keeps the number of false positives small even when the foregoing analysis is expanded to include errors in the continuum flux ( which increase photometric error in the color by a factor @xmath70 ) and a realistic distribution of equivalent widths for the low-@xmath23 galaxy populations . as a further check on our sample",
    ", we use the photometric color error estimates from sextractor to demand that the source be an emission line source at the @xmath71 level .    combining all of these requirements ,",
    "the final criteria for good candidates in our survey become @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "there are @xmath76 such sources detected in the 0  filter in a solid angle of @xmath77 square degree and redshift range @xmath78 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath79 good candidate lyman-@xmath1",
    "emitters per square degree per unit redshift .",
    "the precise upper flux cutoff used is somewhat arbitrary , but including sources with larger fluxes in our list of good candidates has little effect on the total source counts .",
    "the final 16  image had a broader psf than the 0  image , and consequently a reduced effective sensitivity .",
    "in addition , it samples a slightly higher redshift , resulting in an @xmath80 magnitude increase in distance modulus ( @xmath81 , @xmath38 ) . accounting for both effects ,",
    "the matched flux range is @xmath82 at 0  and @xmath83 at 16 .",
    "the corresponding counts are @xmath84 candidates at 16 , and 104 candidates at 0 .",
    "thus , the source density in directly comparable luminosity bins varies by a factor of @xmath85 , a difference that is significant at about the @xmath86 level .",
    "we interpret this as a likely signature of large scale structure in the lyman-@xmath1  emitter distribution at @xmath0 .",
    "the comoving distance between the centers of the two redshift slices is @xmath87 , while the thickness of each slice is @xmath88 and the transverse comoving size @xmath89 ( again assuming @xmath90 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "comparable variations have been observed in the density of lyman break galaxies at @xmath91 ( steidel et al 1998 ) .",
    "our spectroscopic followup sampled a wide range of flux and equivalent width in order to characterize the different populations of sources with extreme narrowband colors , and to thereby tune candidate selection criteria for future spectroscopic observations . those sources with @xmath92 narrowband detections and photometrically measured @xmath93  were all confirmed as emission line objects at the narrowband wavelength . in total , we detected two emitters at @xmath94 , three  emitters at @xmath95 and @xmath12 , one confirmed lyman-@xmath1  ( @xmath96 ) emitter at @xmath97 , and one source that could either be lyman-@xmath1  at @xmath11 or at @xmath12 .",
    "we also found a @xmath98 galaxy with emission lines of , @xmath991640 , and @xmath991663 .",
    "this source may have been included in the narrowband candidate list ( with @xmath100 ) because of a weak spectral break around @xmath101 .",
    "finally , we found a few serendipitous emission line sources in the slit spectra .",
    "one of these is a single - line source with large equivalent width , possibly lyman-@xmath1  at @xmath102 .",
    "spectra of two interesting sources are shown in figure  [ specfig ] .",
    "by combining our imaging survey with these spectroscopic results , we can estimate the source density of lyman-@xmath1  emitters passing our selection cut .",
    "our spectra included three sources fulfilling the criteria given above for good candidates .",
    "of these , one was confirmed as a @xmath10 lyman-@xmath1  source .",
    "a second remains a candidate @xmath11 source , but is more conservatively interpreted as a @xmath12 [ o ii ] emitter on the basis of a rather strong continuum on the blue side of the line .",
    "the third is a clear @xmath94 [ o iii ] emitter .",
    "we therefore estimate that roughly @xmath103 to @xmath104 of the good candidates will be confirmed as lyman-@xmath1  sources , yielding @xmath105 emitters per square degree per unit redshift .",
    "this is compatible with earlier measurements from smaller volumes ( hu et al 1998 ) after accounting for differences in flux threshold .",
    "our measurement is distinct from previous efforts in the field for its basis in a large number of candidate emitters .",
    "poisson errors in our source counts are of order @xmath106 .",
    "this is smaller than the variations observed in the comparison of two filters ( of order @xmath107 ) . by combining observations in multiple fields",
    ", we will be able to average over local fluctuations in number densities effectively . when completed , the lala survey will yield comoving volume of @xmath108 (  [ obsdesc ] ) and a sample of several hundred laes , and will allow the luminosity function , equivalent width distribution , and correlation function of this population to be determined for the first time .",
