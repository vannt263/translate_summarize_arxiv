    "the measurement of the line - shape of the total top - antitop quark production cross section in the threshold region @xmath1 is one of the major tasks within the top quark physics program at the ilc .",
    "the most prominent quantity to be measured is the top quark mass , and one expects an improvement in precision of @xmath2 by about an order of magnitude to mass measurements based on reconstruction obtained at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite .    to obtain a meaningful theoretical description of the nonrelativistic threshold dynamics it is required to systematically sum the so - called coulomb singular terms @xmath3 in a systematic nonrelativistic expansion , @xmath4 being the relative velocity of the top quarks .",
    "this task is achieved by means of effective theories based on nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite . in this approach , however , sizeable logarithmic terms @xmath5 are not systematically accounted for , which leads to rather large normalization uncertainties of the cross section line - shape .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order predictions in this `` fixed - order '' approach were estimated to have a normalization uncertainty of order @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "these normalization uncertainties do not affect the top mass measurement , which primarily depends on the c.m .",
    "energy where the cross section rises , but they render measurements of other quantities such as the top total width or the top quark couplings impossible . to match the statistical uncertainties , that are expected for these quantities , a theoretical precision of the cross section normalization of at least @xmath7 would be required .    in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) it was demonstrated that the summation of logarithmic @xmath8 terms , using renormalization - group - improved perturbation theory , can significantly reduce the normalization uncertainties of the threshold cross section .",
    "concerning qcd effects the renormalization group improved ll ( leading - logarithmic ) and nll order predictions of the threshold cross section are completely known , but no full nnll order prediction exists at present .",
    "the full nnll order prediction is , however , required to obtain a reliable estimate of the remaining theoretical normalization uncertainties .",
    "the missing ingredient is the nnll running of the wilson coefficient of the leading order effective current , that describes production and annihilation of a nonrelativistic @xmath9 pair in a s - wave spin - triplet state ( @xmath10 ) . adopting the label notation from vnrqcd  @xcite",
    "the current has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 annihilate top and antitop quarks with three - momentum @xmath14 , respectively , and where color indices have been suppressed .",
    "the current does not have a ll anomalous dimension because there is no one - loop vertex diagram in the effective theory that contains uv divergences associated with the current @xmath15 .",

    "there are two kinds of contributions to the evolution of @xmath16 that have to be accounted for .",

    "@xcite no complete determination for the subleading evolution exists at present . the analysis of the three - loop ( non - mixing ) terms in ref .",
    "@xcite revealed that the contributions involving the exchange of ultrasoft gluons are more than an order of magnitude larger than those arising from soft matrix element insertions and are as large as the known nll contributions .",
    "the reason is related to the larger size of the ultrasoft coupling @xmath33 and to a rather large coefficient multiplying the ultrasoft contributions .",
    "these large ultrasoft contributions are responsible for an uncertainty in the normalization of the most up - to - date threshold cross section prediction of at best @xmath34  @xcite , which is quite far from the required precision .",

    "from this analysis it is reasonable to assume that the ultrasoft effects , which form a gauge - invariant subset , also dominate the mixing contributions .",
    "this assumption is also consistent with the results for the nll evolution of the coefficient @xmath31  @xcite , which is dominated by soft effects , since the ultrasoft gluon coupling to heavy quarks is spin - independent at this order , and which was found to have a very small numerical effect as well  @xcite . from the parametric point of view",
    "this can be understood from the fact that ultrasoft effects can affect the coefficients of the spin - dependent potentials only indirectly through mixing via potential loop divergences , since at this order the coupling of ultrasoft gluons to heavy quarks are spin - independent . for the coefficient of spin - dependent potentials",
