    "the computation of the soft supersymmetry ( susy)-breaking terms in effective n=1 theories coming from four - dimensional ( 4-d ) superstrings is crucial in order to connect these theories with the low - energy phenomena @xcite .",
    "the soft terms not only contribute to the higgs potential generating the radiative breakdown of the electroweak symmetry , but also determine the susy spectrum , like gaugino , squark or slepton masses .",
    "the most extensive studies of soft terms , working at the perturbative level , have been carried out in the context of ( 0,2 ) symmetric abelian orbifolds @xcite assuming that the seed of susy breaking is located in the dilaton / moduli sectors [ 4 - 9 ] .",
    "the latter implies that the goldstino field is a linear combination of the fermionic partners of the dilaton @xmath0 , the field whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) determines the gauge coupling constant , and the moduli @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the fields whose vevs parametrize the size and shape of the compactified space .",
    "in particular , in refs.@xcite , where no special assumption was made about the possible origin of susy breaking , the soft terms depend on the gravitino mass @xmath3 and the parameters specifying the goldstino direction .",
    "this simplify the analysis of soft terms and leads to some interesting relationships among themselves which could perhaps be experimentally tested @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend this approach for more complicated compactifications as calabi - yau ( cy ) manifolds @xcite .",
    "this is in fact the aim of the present paper .",
    "unfortunately the state - of - the - art cy technology will limit our computation of soft terms .",
    "first , the analysis of ( 0,2 ) vacua is an open problem in cy compactifications and therefore we are forced to restrict our study to ( 2,2 ) theories . in this type of theories",
    "the gauge group is @xmath4 and several families of @xmath5 and @xmath6 matter fields can be present .",
    "may be these are not the most realistic low - energy theories since usually one likes gauge groups smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "in any case we hope , as occurs in orbifolds , they give us an insight into features of ( 0,2 ) models . on the other hand ,",
    "if the suggestion that all susy ( 2,2 ) vacua with @xmath4 gauge symmetry are compactifications on cy manifolds @xcite is correct , our results would be of interest for any compactification scheme with those properties .",
    "finally , we will focus on the region of the moduli space where all the @xmath8 are large , often called the large - radius limit .",
    "the reason is that this limit provides a good approximation to the 4-d effective theory .",
    "the extension to small manifolds is quite involved and again an open problem .",
    "large @xmath9 , in practice , does not really mean @xmath10 , since the world - sheet instanton corrections are exponentially suppressed . for values @xmath11 these world - sheet instanton contributions can often be neglected and , in this sense these @xmath9-values are already large . on the other hand ,",
    "the vev of the moduli are not necessarily of order one . as studied in specific orbifold examples in ref.@xcite",
    ", @xmath12 is mandatory if the discrepancy between the unification scale of the gauge couplings and the string unification scale is explained by the effect of string threshold corrections .",
    "this might also be the case of cy compactifications .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss some formulae for the computation of soft terms in effective supergravity ( sugra ) theories from strings , in the most general case of off - diagonal metrics . in the spirit of refs.@xcite ,",
    "i.e. just assuming that susy is broken by dilaton / moduli fields , we parametrize the susy breaking in terms of `` goldstino angles '' generalizing the ones used there to the case of off - diagonal moduli metric .",
    "this is precisely the case of cy compactifications . unlike orbifolds , where off - diagonal metrics are relatively rare , these are present in general in cy manifolds .",
    "thus in section 3 we apply the formulae obtained in section 2 to the computation of the soft terms . after summarizing some generic features of effective sugras coming from cy compactifications ,",
    "we obtain general formulae for the soft terms which are independent of the size of the manifold .",
    "an interesting limit where universality is achieved is studied in 3.2 .",
    "then , in order to obtain more concrete features we work in the large - radius limit , where the prepotential is known , computing the khler potential including the sigma - model and instanton contributions .",
    "first we discuss the simple cases of cy manifolds with only one khler modulus .",
    "these will be good guiding examples in order to study in detail the modifications produced on soft terms by the above - mentioned contributions .",
    "second , we consider the general case of cy compactifications with several moduli studying what new features appear . finally , in section 4 , we compare the results on soft terms obtained in the previous sections with those of orbifold compactifications .",
    "we leave the conclusions for section 5 .",
    "we are going to consider @xmath13 susy 4-d strings with @xmath14 moduli @xmath1 , @xmath15 .",
    "such notation refers to both @xmath9-type and @xmath16-type ( khler class and complex structure in the calabi - yau language ) fields .",
    "in addition there will be charged matter fields @xmath17 and the dilaton field @xmath0 . the associated effective @xmath13 sugra khler potentials ( to first order in the matter fields ) are of the type : @xmath18 the first piece is the usual term corresponding to the dilaton @xmath0 which is present for any compactification whereas the second is the khler potential of the moduli fields .",
    "the greek indices label the matter fields and their kinetic term functions are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 to lowest order in the matter fields .",
    "the last piece is often forbidden by gauge invariance in specific models although it may be relevant in order to solve the @xmath21 problem @xcite .",
    "the complete @xmath13 sugra lagrangian is determined by the khler potential @xmath22 , the superpotential @xmath23 and the gauge kinetic functions @xmath24 , where @xmath25 generically denotes the chiral fields @xmath26 .",
    "as is well known , @xmath27 and @xmath28 appear in the lagrangian only in the combination @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , the ( @xmath30 part of the ) scalar potential is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath34 .",
    "we have also written @xmath35 as a function of the @xmath25 auxiliary fields , @xmath36 .    following the spirit of refs.@xcite the crucial assumption now is to locate the origin of susy breaking in the dilaton / moduli sector . then , applying the standard sugra formulae @xcite to the most general case when the moduli and matter metrics are not diagonal we obtain : @xmath37\\ , \\label{mmatrix2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the soft mass matrix and the soft trilinear parameters respectively ( corresponding to un - normalized charged fields ) , @xmath40 is the gravitino mass - squared , @xmath41 with @xmath42 a renormalizable yukawa coupling involving three charged chiral fields and finally , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the dilaton and moduli auxiliary fields respectively .",
    "notice that , as discussed in @xcite , after normalizing the fields to get canonical kinetic terms , the first piece in eq.([mmatrix ] ) will lead to universal diagonal soft masses but the second piece will generically induce off - diagonal contributions .",
    "concerning the @xmath45-parameters , notice that we have not factored out the yukawa couplings as usual , since proportionality is not guaranteed .",
    "indeed , although the first term in @xmath39 is always proportional in flavour space to the corresponding yukawa coupling , the same thing is not necessarily true for the other terms .",
    "we will see below that this is precisely what occurs in general with scalar masses and trilinear parameters in cy compactifications .",
    "however , there is an interesting limit where universality is achieved .    if the vev of the scalar potential eq.([pot ] ) , @xmath46 , is not assumed to be zero one just has to replace @xmath47 in the expression of @xmath38 .",

    "e.g. , for @xmath188 given by ( [ primera ] ) the two squared - mass eigenvalues are @xmath203\\ , \\label{mjj } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath204 for instance , @xmath205 implies @xmath206 , i.e. @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",

    "this requires @xmath215 , i.e. one is pushed towards the `` overall - modulus '' limit ) .",
    "we recall that we are not considering in this computation , for the sake of simplicity , the @xmath130-model and instanton contributions .",
    "] , @xmath216 ( see eq.([parametrization ] ) ) .",
    "this is a general result , the universality of soft breaking parameters in multimoduli cases is achieved by vanishing @xmath188 .",
    "the equivalent result for trilinear parameters is that the braces in ( [ trilinearprima ] ) must be vanishing .    since some of the eigenvalues @xmath217 can be positive ( see e.g. ( [ yoquese ] ) ) , this open the possibility of having scalars heavier than gauginos depending on the goldstino direction .",
    "the necessary condition is the same than in ( [ pesados ] ) with @xmath218 .",
    "finally , for negative eigenvalues , depending again on the goldstino direction , tachyons may appear unless @xmath219",
    "it is interesting to compare the previous results on soft terms with those of orbifold compactifications @xcite .",
    "we recall that orbifolds are a special limit of particular cy manifolds .",
    "let us focus first on the `` overall - modulus '' case .",
    "for this class of orbifold models the khler potential has the form @xmath220 it is important to remark that , unlike the case of smooth cy models , the above @xmath9 dependence does not get corrections from world - sheet instantons and is equally valid for small and large @xmath9 .",
    "notice that , with matter fields in the untwisted sector , i.e. modular weight @xmath221 , the resulting khler potential is analogous to the one obtained in the large - radius limit of cy models neglecting the @xmath130-model and instanton corrections ( see eqs.([kmatter],[bebo ] ) and footnote 10 ) . as a consequence , in the untwisted sector of orbifolds the soft terms",
    "are also given by ( [ malo6],[malo ] ) with gaugino masses always bigger than scalar masses ( [ relations ] ) .",
    "unlike cy models now eq.([malo ] ) is exact since yukawa couplings involving untwisted fields are constants and therefore the last term in ( [ malo5 ] ) is exactly zero .    as discussed below eq.([relations ] ) , the situation is qualitatively different when @xmath130-model and instanton corrections are included in cy models .",
    "then , the soft terms are modified due to the non - vanishing values of @xmath179 and @xmath181 in eqs.([delta_approximate],[omega_approximate ] ) allowing e.g. the possibility of scalars heavier than gauginos .    relaxing the `` overall - modulus '' assumption in orbifolds , some qualitative changes appear . in the multimoduli case , non - universal soft scalar masses for untwisted particles",
    "are allowed and in fact this will be the most general situation .",
    "tachyons may also be present .",
    "finally , there may be scalars with mass bigger than gauginos .",
    "however , on average the scalars are lighter than gauginos since three particles linked via a renormalizable untwisted yukawa coupling always fulfill the sum rule @xmath222 as in the `` overall - modulus '' case ( @xmath223 ) . for trilinear parameters one also has @xmath224 in ref.@xcite was shown that these results ( [ sumrule],[sumrule2 ] ) are satisfied even in the presence of off - diagonal metrics .",
    "let us recall that although diagonal metrics is the generic case in most of orbifolds , off - diagonal ones appear for fields in the untwisted sector of the orbifolds @xmath225 ( see footnote 4 )",
    ".    in cy compactifications where off - diagonal metrics are always present , some of the above orbifold properties are qualitatively similar . in the previous section we showed that non - universality is a natural situation due to the generic matrix structure of the soft masses ( @xmath9 ) moduli contribute to susy breaking , the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) soft masses and trilinear terms are universal .",
    "this is not true in the case of orbifolds . ] .",
    "likewise , the presence of tachyons or scalars heavier than gauginos was allowed .",
    "however , the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) is violated in general . as an example",
    ", we can consider the two - moduli cases studied in the previous section , where @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 are the allowed yukawa couplings . from ( [ mjj ] ) we obtain @xmath230 where , taking into account ( [ mjjj ] ) , is easy to see that @xmath231 ; @xmath232 and both possibilities are allowed for @xmath233 depending on the @xmath234 values . due to these two possibilities , we can not say as in the case of orbifolds that on average the scalars are lighter than gauginos .",
    "this is an interesting novel fact .",
    "likewise ( [ sumrule2 ] ) , which is fulfilled in orbifolds due to the antisymmetric property of yukawa couplings , no longer is true in cy compactifications as discussed below eq.([trilinearprima ] ) .",
    "the study of the soft susy - breaking terms coming from string compactifications is highly important since they determine the low - energy phenomenology of these theories .",
    "we have carried out this study for some specially interesting and complicated spaces . in particular ,",
    "calabi - yau manifolds have been analyzed with all the detail allowed by the present state - of - the - art technology . as discussed in the introduction only the large - radius limit of ( 2,2 ) theories is really available .    after providing a parametrization of the soft terms in terms of `` goldstino angles '' for the most general case of off - diagonal metrics ,",
    "we have computed them for calabi - yau spaces .",
    "although these results are general in the sense that they do not depend on the size of the manifold , in order to obtain more concrete features we have also worked in the large - radius limit where the prepotential is known .",
    "as mentioned above , the soft terms show formidable complexity mainly due to the @xmath130-model and instanton contributions to the khler potential as well as the existence of off - diagonal moduli and matter metrics .",
    "although in the large - radius limit instanton contributions are negligible since they are exponentially suppressed , @xmath130-model corrections to the soft terms may be important depending on the value of @xmath235 .",
    "on the other hand , very specific features appear due to the presence of off - diagonal metrics .",
    "for example , soft scalar masses have a generic matrix structure giving rise to non - universality in general .",
    "however , there is an interesting situation , susy breaking by @xmath16 ( @xmath9)-moduli sector , where universality for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) representations is achieved .",
    "tachyons may also appear .",
    "other features are related with the possibility of having scalars lighter or heavier than gauginos depending on the goldstino direction . in this sense",
    ", sum rules found in orbifold models , which imply that on average the scalars are lighter than gauginos , can be violated in calabi - yau manifolds .",
