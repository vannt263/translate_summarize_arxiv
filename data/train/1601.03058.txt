    "the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , between redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , is one of the least studied epochs in the history of the universe and is a research frontier in present - day cosmology @xcite . during this process ,",
    "the neutral intergalactic gas was likely ionized by ultra - violet ( uv ) photons emitted by stars .",
    "in addition , sources of x - ray photons , such as x - ray binaries , mini - quasars and hot gas in galaxies , also had an effect on the epoch of reionization ( eor ) by pre - heating and mildly ionizing the gas far from the sources @xcite .",
    "the eor also affects the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) through its scattering off free electrons .",
    "this scattering degrades the accuracy with which cosmological parameters can be extracted from the cmb data .",
    "in particular , measurements of the amplitude of primordial fluctuations , @xmath3 , is degenerate with the total optical depth , @xmath0 , since the total amplitude is estimated from the temperature power spectrum of the cmb as @xmath4 .",
    "because the precision with which @xmath0 can be measured using the cmb is very poor ( e.g. , the 68% confidence level in @xmath0 corresponds to a relative error of @xmath5 when measured from the temperature power spectrum ) , the errors in @xmath3 are high . as a result ,",
    "@xmath0 is sometimes referred to as a nuisance parameter for cmb cosmology .",
    "luckily , alternative probes of reionization can provide independent constraints on @xmath0 and remove the related uncertainty .",
    "one of the most promising tools to constrain reionization is the predicted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen , hi , e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature of this signal , @xmath6 , depends on the fractional amount of hydrogen atoms in the igm which are neutral , @xmath7 , and , thus , is expected to provide exclusive information on the reionization history of the universe .",
    "recently , @xcite advocated that the sky - averaged ( global ) 21-cm signal , @xmath8 , alone has enough information to fully reconstruct the reionization history and measure the optical depth to reionization with great precision . to alleviate the computational costs , the authors assumed that the 21-cm signal tracks the ionization history , which is true only when x - ray sources heat up the cosmic gas to a temperature above the cmb well before the beginning of reionization . in this case , the dependence of @xmath6 on the gas temperature is saturated ( the so - called saturated heating regime ) , @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath7 , and the reionization history can be fully extracted from the global 21-cm signal measurements despite the presence of strong foregrounds . in particular , @xcite showed that assuming saturated heating , the 21-cm signal allows to determine @xmath0 with much higher accuracy than it is possible from the cmb measurements .",
    "however , the assumption that heating is saturated all the way through reionization is debated @xcite , and the nature and efficiency of early x - ray sources could have a significant impact on the intensity of the redshifted 21-cm signal even at the end of the eor @xcite .",
    "the nature of the first x - ray sources is still unknown and possible candidates include x - ray binaries @xcite and mini - quasars @xcite which emit hard x - rays with spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaking at few kev , soft x - ray sources such as hot gas in galaxies which can be well described by a power - law spectral shape @xcite , as well as more exotic candidates such as annihilating dark matter @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of high - redshift sources , @xmath9 , defined through the relation between their luminosity and the star formation rate is another unknown ( @xcite and references therein ) , calibrated so that the value of @xmath10 corresponds to the luminosity of observed low - redshift sources boosted by a metallicity - dependent factor @xcite .",
    "here we consider a completely model - independent method to reconstruct @xmath0 from the global 21-cm signal measurements after relaxing the saturated heating assumption and examining realistic x - ray sources with hard and soft spectra varying their efficiency .",
    "our results are timely since many of the experiments such as the experiment to detect the global epoch of reionization signature ( edges , @xcite ) , large - aperture experiment to detect the dark ages ( leda , @xcite , @xcite ) , dark ages radio explorer ( dare , @xcite ) , and new extension in nancay upgrading lofar ( nenufar , @xcite ) are on their way to detect this signal for the first time while next generation telescopes , such as the hydrogen epoch of reionization array ( hera ) and the square kilometer array ( ska , @xcite ) , are expected to extensively explore the eor .    in section [ sec :",
    "sim ] we set up the stage describing simulation methods and model parameters . in section [ sec : rec ] we explore to which extent the global 21-cm signal tracks the neutral fraction in each case and propose a model - independent way to reconstruct the heating and ionization history from the global 21-cm signal . in section [ sec : od ] we calculate the optical depth from the reconstructed reionization history and discuss the accuracy with which it can be detected by global 21-cm experiments .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the standard planck satellite cosmology @xcite .",
    "we simulate the mock global 21-cm signal from the redshift range @xmath11 using a hybrid simulation , first introduced by @xcite and described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "this simulation allows to estimate the non - local impact of x - ray , ly-@xmath12 and uv sources on the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen as well as on the ionization history of the igm , and includes the effect of supersonic flows between dark matter and gas , @xmath13 @xcite , which has an impact on high - redshift star formation in @xmath14 m@xmath15 halos @xcite and , consequently , on the 21-cm signal @xcite .",
    "in addition , we account for the photoheating feedback @xcite which happens when the intergalactic gas heats up and stops accreting into halos below @xmath16 m@xmath15 , thus suppressing star formation in low - mass halos .    in our simulation ,",
    "ionization by uv photons is computed following the excursion - set formalism , by comparing the time - integrated number of ionizing photons to the number of neutral atoms in each region @xcite .",
    "specifically , a simulation cell is ionized if @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the ionization efficiency normalized to yield @xmath0 , @xmath19 is the collapsed fraction , and @xmath20 is the fraction of free electrons .",
    "in addition , we account for partial ionization of the neutral igm by x - rays , which boost the free electron fraction far from the sources and have a non - negligible effect on the topology of reionization .",
    "the reionization history is strongly linked to the mechanism of star formation and its timing depends on the minimal mass of halos that can form stars , m@xmath21 .",
    "the smaller is m@xmath21 , the earlier reionization starts and the more gradual is the grows of the ionized fraction . because star formation at high redshifts is very unconstrained and is biased by multiple feedback mechanisms @xcite , we consider three different scenarios varying the low - mass cutoff of star forming halos :    * `` massive halos '' : stars form in halos of m@xmath22 m@xmath15 ( circular velocity @xmath23 km / s ) . * `` atomic cooling '' : stars form through the atomic cooling channel in halos of m@xmath24 m@xmath15 ( circular velocity @xmath25 km / s ) with active photoheating feedback . * `` molecular cooling '' : star formation happens in all halos with circular velocity @xmath26 km / s ( m@xmath27 m@xmath15 ) . in this case",
    "we include the photoheating feedback , account for the effect of @xmath13 , but exclude the effect of lyman - werner ( lw ) photons which are expected to destroy molecular hydrogen acting as negative feedback to star formation . the degree to which the lw feedback is efficient is a topic of active research @xcite ; therefore , we ignore the effect of this feedback here to optimize the contribution of the molecular cooling halos and increase the diversity of ionization histories .",
    "the case of molecular cooling with lw and @xmath13 included is close to the atomic cooling scenario @xcite which we consider separately .",
    "although the role of molecular cooling halos in reionization is expected to be small based on the low optical depth found by planck satellite , their contribution is not ruled out considering large uncertainty in @xmath0 measurements .    in all the above cases",
    "we assume a star formation efficiency of @xmath28 .",
    "we consider the contribution of hydrogen and first helium reionizatio to @xmath0 , assuming that singly ionized helium and hydrogen are ionized to the same fraction , @xmath20 @xcite , and normalize our models to yield @xmath0 consistent with planck @xcite while also requiring reionization to end by @xmath29 or earlier . for atomic and massive halos we choose @xmath30 which gives the redshift of full reionization , @xmath31 , being @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "this value of @xmath0 is between the planck and wmap measurements of the optical depth and is @xmath34 away from the planck s best fit value of 0.066 . in the case of molecular cooling",
    "the process of reionization is very gradual , and we need to take @xmath35 ( @xmath36 away from the planck s best fit value ) to have reionization end by @xmath37 .    finally , we consider two types of heating sources : ( i ) x - ray binaries with hard sed , and ( ii ) soft sources with power - law sed ( as described by @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we consider three different values of heating efficiency for each type of sources : @xmath38 ( low ) , @xmath39 ( standard ) and @xmath40 ( high ) .",
    "the choice of low and high heating efficiencies is motivated by rather poor observational constrains on the temperature of the igm before the end of reionization . the unresolved soft cosmic x - ray background , which amounts to @xmath41 of the flux in the @xmath42 kev _ chandra _ band @xcite , sets an upper limit on @xmath9 when attributed to the high redshift sources @xcite .",
    "depending on the details of star formation and for eor ending at @xmath37 this measurement yields an upper bound of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) in the case of hard ( soft ) x - rays ; while for @xmath45 the efficiencies should be @xmath46 times higher @xcite .",
    "here we choose @xmath40 as a representative value of the high heating efficiency for all the considered models .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath9 comes from the data collected by the precision array for probing the eor ( paper , @xcite , @xcite ) which rules out 21-cm fluctuations of power greater than @xmath47 mk@xmath48 at @xmath49 in the k = 0.15 - 0.5 h mpc@xmath50 range , where h is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath50 mpc@xmath50 .",
    "this constrain translates into @xmath51 ( 0.001 ) for hard ( soft ) x - ray sources in the atomic cooling case",
    ". however , for such low efficiency , the gas appears to be colder than the cmb by the end of eor , and the method which we present in this paper does not apply . therefore we choose @xmath38 as our low heating efficiency value .    for every model we output global neutral fraction , @xmath52 ( which we refer to as the true reionziation history ) , average kinetic gas temperature @xmath53 and the 21-cm signal which depends on the ionization and thermal history in the following way , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant that depends on atomic physics and cosmological parameters , @xmath56 is the baryon overdensity which is statistically known from cosmology , and @xmath57 is the cmb temperature . here",
    "we ignore the peculiar velocity term , which adds a small correction to the global 21-cm signal @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath58 is the spin temperature of the 21-cm transition which depends on environment . in particular , when ly-@xmath12 coupling is saturated , which is usually true for @xmath59 , we can equate the spin temperature to gas kinetic temperature , @xmath60 @xcite ; while @xmath61 when the igm is much hotter than the cmb ( the saturated heating case ) . in the latter case eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) can be further simplified , @xmath62 , and the 21-cm signal can be used as a tracer of neutral fraction weighted by the density fluctuations .    typical global spectrum of the 21-cm signal ( left column of figure [ fig:1 ] ) features a prominent trough at frequencies corresponding to redshifts where the igm was colder than the cmb ( the signal is seen in absorption ) .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath63 is reached at the beginning of heating era at redshift @xmath64 when the first population of x - ray sources turned on . at this point also",
    "the temperature of the gas , which was adiabatically cooled by cosmic expansion , reaches its minimum ( right column of figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "x - ray sources inject energy into the igm heating it up and above the temperature of the cmb , if heating is sufficiently strong . in this case",
    "the 21-cm signal is seen in emission against the cmb at redshifts lower than @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the emission signal peaks at @xmath67 and its amplitude declines at lower redshifts as reionization progresses .",
    "if heating is not strong enough , pockets of neutral gas remain colder than the cmb throughout the eor , marked by a grey band in each panel of figure [ fig:1 ] , and the 21-cm signal is seen in absorption all the way down to @xmath31 .",
    "we list @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath67 in table 1 for every considered model .",

    "+ [ tab:1 ]    as figure [ fig:1 ] suggests ( and as was recently reported by @xcite ) , the saturated heating assumption may be justified only in the case of high @xmath9 ( green lines in the figure ) where the igm is indeed hotter than the cmb at the beginning of the eor . in other cases",
    "the gas is colder than the cmb at the beginning of reionization and undergoes the heating transition during the eor .",
    "the most interesting case is that of massive halos , which is also well - motivated by the low optical depth measurements .",
    "for this star formation scenario heating is slower than reionization and the neutral gas is always colder than the cmb in two out of six cases , namely the case of hard x - ray sources with standard and low heating efficiency .",
    "we would now like to mimic a global 21-cm experiment , assuming the foregrounds fully under control , where we rely on @xcite who showed that foreground contamination from galactic synchrotron emission @xcite , can be mitigated , allowing precise reconstruction of the optical depth from the global 21-cm signal .",
    "we first examine to which extent the global 21-cm signal can be used to constrain the ionization history and reconstruct the neutral fraction , and then ( in the next section ) use this information to extract the total cmb optical depth .",
    "we start by adopting the saturated heating assumption .",

    "two critical points of the global spectrum can inform us about the heating history : ( i ) the redshift of the heating transition , @xmath65 , where the gas temperature equates that of the cmb , @xmath97 , and ( ii ) the trough of the 21-cm signal at @xmath64 which represents the beginning of the heating era .",

    ", @xmath95 follows the general trend of @xmath53 , and the reconstructed factor @xmath102 correctly reproduces the features of the true value of @xmath101 . undoubtedly , this is a much better approximation that the saturated heating assumption ; however , a better guess of the thermal history during the eor would be very beneficial for the @xmath7 extraction",
    ".        we use the reconstructed factor @xmath102 to estimate the ionization history according to eq .",

    "an example of @xmath103 is shown in figure [ fig:3 ] , and we list the values of @xmath81 for which the deviation of the estimated neutral fraction from the true one is 5% in table 1 . with the temperature information added , @xmath103 follows the true neutral fraction up to @xmath104 in the case of @xmath39 , hard sed and atomic cooling shown in the figure ( red lines ) , while this case was completely missed by @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , for the rest of the considered models the redhsift at which the deviation reaches 5% is pushed deeper into the first half of reionization with the exception of all the cases with @xmath38 for which the neutral igm is barely ( or not at all ) heated to @xmath57 by the end of reionization as well as the case of massive halos with @xmath70 and hard sed . this inability to track @xmath52",
    "is explained by the fact that our @xmath95 is a too poor approximation and lacks precision to serve in the regime @xmath105 .",
    "next , we would like to develop a model - independent method to reconstruct the entire reionization history based on the global 21-cm signal .",
    "to this end , we choose to use @xmath106 ( and not @xmath92 ) as a tracer of the neutral fraction . from our analysis in the previous section , we know that this approximation works well during the late stages of the eor ; however , we do not have a good measure for the critical redshift ( or the value of the neutral fraction ) , @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , up to which this approximation holds . here",
    "we adopt a rather conservative approach , outlined below , to define this instant and to reconstruct the full ionization history , @xmath109 .",
    "first , we keep all the measured data points for which @xmath106 is guaranteed to follow the true neutral fraction starting from the end of reionizaion at @xmath31 and up to @xmath107 .",
    "we adopt the next model - independent criterion to find @xmath107 : if the signal is seen in emission at the advanced stages of the eor , we search for a redshift ( @xmath107 ) between @xmath31 and the emission peak at which the derivative @xmath110 is maximal .",
    "intuitively , this instant marks the change in the behavior of the global signal when it transits between ionization - driven to heating - driven evolution .",
    "clearly , this approach does not apply to the cases with no emission feature .",
    "this definition is rather conservative , and in the cases with high degree of heating we lose some information . in particular",
    ", @xmath111 is typically lower than the value of @xmath106 where it deviates from the true neutral fraction by more than 5% ( table 1 ) ; moreover , in these cases @xmath92 works as well as @xmath106 at redshifts below @xmath107",
    ". however , this definition of @xmath107 works very well in the cases when heating is weak and extracting the reionization information from the global signal is difficult , e.g. , in the cases of @xmath39 with hard sed for molecular and atomic cooling .",
    "we find that in these cases @xmath111 is very close to the marginal value of @xmath52 at which @xmath112 ceases to be a good approximation .",
    "in other words , when using this model - independent criterion we do succeed to retain all the useful information in the `` difficult '' cases with weak heating ; while we do lose some information in the `` easy '' cases with enough heating ( however , as we see in the next section , this loss does not affect our main results ) .",
    "second , we assume that eor starts at @xmath113 with the universe being neutral at higher redshifts .",
    "this `` anchor '' point can be determined from independent experiments , e.g. , using the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite ; therefore , we do not include @xmath113 in the list of our free parameters when fitting the ionization history .",
    "third , in the intermediate redshift range ( @xmath114 ) @xmath109 is completed using a fitting function @xmath115 .",
    "we tried several options and found that the best results in terms of the final optical depth estimate are achieved with a three - parameter function which appears to fit the reionization history reasonably well for all the considered cases for which our approach can be applied ( i.e. , all the cases which undergo the heating transition until the end of the eor ) .",
    "in particular , here we choose cumulative distribution function of gamma distribution @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the shape parameter , @xmath118 is the scale parameter , and @xmath119 marks the end of reionization .",
    "it is worth noting that in addition to the temperature effects , photoheating feedback complicates the fitting procedure for atomic and molecular cooling .",
    "in the presence of this feedback , the low - redshift neutral fraction does no longer follow the collapsed fraction ( as it does in the case of massive halos which are immune to the photoheating feedback ) . for x - ray binaries with @xmath39 ( red curve in figure [ fig:3 ] ) formed in atomic cooling halos",
    "the true neutral fraction follows the collapsed fraction at high values of @xmath52 , while changing its behavior at @xmath120 due to the presence of a feature ( a bump ) introduced by the photoheating feedback . in this particular case ,",
    "the information which we can extract from @xmath121 is dominated by the photoheating effects and does not give us any insight on the process of reionization at higher redshifts which we try to fit .    in total , our reconstructed neutral fraction , which we use in the next section to find @xmath0 , is @xmath122    we find that our method works well for the majority of cases with @xmath123 and @xmath115 does a decent job reconstructing @xmath52 when the starting point of reionization , @xmath113 , is chosen close to the true value .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows two examples of @xmath124 : ( i ) a case where the reconstruction works well ( atomic cooling with hard sed and @xmath40 , @xmath125 , shown with black curves in the figure ) , and ( ii ) where it fails ( atomic cooling with hard sed and @xmath38 , @xmath126 , red curves ) . here we clearly see that in the case of the low heating efficiency the photoheating feature is very misleading and does not allow for a more accurate fitting .",
    "( solid ) for atomic cooling with @xmath38 ( red ) and @xmath40 ( black ) .",

    "the cmb optical depth is dependent on the ionization history @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the average number density of free electrons in ionized regions accounting for hydrogen ionization and first helium ionization , @xmath133 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath134 is the line - of - sight proper distance element .",
    "thus , knowing the ionization history from the global 21-cm signal should allow estimating the optical depth .",
    "although the reconstruction @xmath109 does not work perfectly well to reproduce @xmath52 as can be seen from figure [ fig:5 ] , the error in @xmath0 is expected to be much smaller than the error in @xmath52 itself because : ( i ) the largest part of the optical depth is contributed by redshifts @xmath135 when the universe was fully ionized ( in our case of massive halos with reionization ending at @xmath136 only 30% of the optical depth is sourced by the ionized patches during the eor ) ; and ( ii ) the fit over- and under - predicts @xmath52 at different redshifts which results is partial cancellation of the error .    using @xmath109 we compute the optical depth @xmath137 and compare it to the true value , @xmath0 , found directly from the simulation data .",
    "the accuracy with which the optical depth can be extracted from the global signal depends on the value of @xmath113 , as can be seen from figure [ fig:4 ] where the fractional error in the optical depth , @xmath138 , is shown as a function of @xmath113 for all the cases where the fitting procedure converged . in most of our cases @xmath139 features a broad minimum ( of @xmath140 ) within which the fractional error in @xmath0 is below 1% .",
    "the location of this feature is very close to the true beginning of eor , marked by grey bars in figure [ fig:4 ] which correspond to the @xmath141 values of ionized fraction .",
    "the minimal value of the fractional error , which we quote in table 1 together with the corresponding @xmath113 is below @xmath142 , which is much better than the current 1@xmath143 confidence level of the planck satellite ( @xmath5 ) . in cases where the reconstruction does not work well and",
    "the fractional error does not feature a minimum , @xmath144 remains below @xmath145 level in the @xmath141 range of the ionized fraction .",
    "the total cmb optical depth is a long - standing nuisance for cmb cosmology . here",
    "we have examined to which extent the global 21-cm signal can be used to probe the total cmb optical depth in realistic cases of igm heating , including hard and soft x - ray sources with low , standard and high heating efficiency .",
    "following @xcite , we have shown that the intensity of the 21-cm signal produced during the eor is strongly affected by the thermal state of the igm in addition to its ionization , which makes it harder to extract the reionization history from the global 21-cm signal compared to a scenario in which heating is saturated @xcite .",
    "we have developed a simple and model independent approach to reconstruct the neutral fraction from a realistic global 21-cm signal and used it to estimate the optical depth for a large variety of models with different ionization and heating histories .",
    "the method can be summarized as follows : ( i ) at low redshifts we extract the neutral fraction from the global 21-cm signal going beyond the saturated heating assumption and using information on the thermal state of the igm extracted directly from the mock global 21-cm signal ; ( ii ) we assume that the redshift at which reionization starts , @xmath113 , is known with the universe neutral at that epoch ; ( iii ) we complement the neutral fraction in the intermediate redshift range using a three - parameter fitting function which works well for the different types of reionization histories which we have explored .",
    "one of the main conclusions we reach is that with the thermal history added a better estimation of the reionization history is possible , and the neutral fraction can be reconstructed even when the 21-cm signal is affected by thermal history all the way throughout the eor . as a proof of concept , we adopt a very simple method to estimate the temperature of neutral igm using two critical points of the global signal , namely ( i ) the heating transition at which the gas kinetic temperature equates that of the cmb , and ( ii ) the beginning of the heating era when x - ray sources turn on .",
    "even this simple method improves over the saturated heating approximation .",
    "finally , we calculate the optical depth using the extracted reionization history and show that an accurate measurement of @xmath0 , with fractional error below 1% over a wide range of @xmath113 , is possible even when the igm heating is not saturated all the way throughout the eor .",
    "we have blindly tested our method on a large variety of ionization histories for different star formation scenarios varying the low - mass cutoff of star - forming halos .",
    "our results are timely considering the plethora of existing and planned global 21-cm experiments which might remove the optical depth nuisance from the cmb cosmology in near future , allowing for a much more precise determination of the cosmological parameters .",
