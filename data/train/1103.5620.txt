    "one often reflects on the controversial nature of the tunnelling time issue .",
    "a common feature of many approaches ( for a review see @xcite-@xcite ) is that proposed tunnelling times appear as mere parameters , endowed , unlike most other quantities , with neither probability amplitudes nor probability distributions .",
    "inclusion of such time parameters into the framework of standard quantum theory is clearly desirable .",
    "one such parameter is the phase ( wigner ) time used to characterise transmission of a wavepacket @xcite-@xcite . in the phase time analysis one",
    "typically proceeds by expanding the logarithm of the transmission amplitude @xmath3 in a taylor series around the particle s mean momentum @xmath4 . retaining only linear terms",
    "one finds the transmitted part of a gaussian pulse to be given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the freely propagating state and @xmath7 is a complex valued quantity .",
    "if spreading of the wavepacket can be neglected , @xmath8 gives the shift of the transmitted pulse @xmath9 relative to a freely propagating one , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe overall reduction of its size . the term _ hartman effect _ ( he )",
    "@xcite refers to the fact that as the width of ( e.g. , rectangular ) barrier @xmath0 tends to infinity , the tunnelled pulse is advanced roughly by the width of the classically forbidden region @xmath12 .",
    "this creates an impression that the barrier has been crossed almost infinitely fast and using the shift to evaluate the duration spent in the region one arrives at the phase time @xmath13 , which is independent of the barrier width .",
    "there is a large volume of literature on the he ( see @xcite-@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) as well as current interest in its experimental observations @xcite .",
    "one problem in defining the he for wavepackets is that one can not simply fix the shape of the incident pulse and increase the width of the barrier @xcite , @xcite , since eventually the transmission will become dominated by the momenta passing over the barrier , for which eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) no longer holds .",
    "one can make the pulse ever narrower in the momentum space , but then there is no guarantee that the spatial width @xmath1 of the pulse need not become much greater than the advancement one wants to detect . in this vein , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that the he is an artifact of the stationary formulation of the scattering theory and can not be realised once localisation of the tunnelling particle is taken into account .",
    "their conclusions appear to agree with those of winful @xcite who pointed out that in a tunnelling experiment the width of the incident wavepacket must exceed the size of the barrier .",
    "one can , however , imagine an optimal case , where @xmath1 would be large enough to justify the approximation ( [ z1 ] ) , yet always smaller than the expected advancement @xmath0 .",
    "if so , one would be able to observe the advancement associated with the he in a single tunnelling event .",
    "a similar problem arises in the seemingly different context of the so - called weak measurements .",
    "there one measures the value of an operator @xmath14 using a pointer whose initial position is uncertain , so as not to perturb the measured system .",
    "if the uncertainty is large , the mean of the meter s readings coincides with the real part of the the weak value of @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "this may lie well outside the spectrum of @xmath14 or even tend to infinity , and one s wish is to observe such an unusual value .",
    "often the spread of the readings exceeds @xmath16 , thus requiring a large number of trials before the value can be established . if , on the other hand , the large spread can be made significantly smaller than @xmath16 , a single measurement would yield information about @xmath15 .",
    "the authors of @xcite , @xcite gave a possible recipe for constructing such measurements , which they described as weak but not really weak. analogy between tunnelling times and weak values has been studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite-@xcite .",
    "discussion of causality in barrier penetration can be found in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce an amplitude distribution for the phase time @xmath17 or , rather for the spacial delay associated with @xmath17 , to demonstrate that locating the transmitted particle amounts to a weak measurement of this delay , and prove that this measurement is of the not really weak kind mentioned above .",

    "ii and iii we establish formal equivalence between wavepacket transmission and quantum measurements . in sect .",
