    "quantum communication protocols are very sensitive to noise and decoherence that accompanies distribution of quantum states over any realistic quantum channel .",
    "the main source of errors in optical quantum communication systems is losses , that e.g. limit the range of current point - to - point quantum cryptography to about one hundred of kilometers @xcite .",
    "significant attention has been therefore paid in recent years to finding schemes that would allow to suppress the noise and decoherence in quantum communication .",
    "of particular interest is a faithful distribution of pure entangled quantum states between two distant parties alice and bob who can subsequently use them as resource for some quantum information processing tasks such as quantum teleportation or entanglement - based quantum key distribution .",
    "alice and bob can achieve this goal by employing a protocol known as entanglement distillation @xcite .",
    "they first distribute several copies of an entangled state over the noisy channel . from the shared copies of a weakly entangled and mixed state",
    "they then extract a highly entangled pure state by means of local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) . elementary entanglement distillation and concentration schemes",
    "have been successfully demonstrated experimentally for entangled two - photon states @xcite as well as for two entangled optical modes @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting but also complicated is the distillation of so - called continuous - variable ( cv ) entanglement where we deal with quantum states belonging to an infinite dimensional hilbert space of field modes .",
    "the experimentally easily accessible cv gaussian states , which possess gaussian wigner function , can not be distilled by gaussian operations only @xcite .",
    "this means that some non - gaussian operation , such as photon - counting @xcite or kerr nonlinearity @xcite is required .",
    "an iterative cv entanglement distillation protocol for gaussian states was proposed by browne and coworkers @xcite .",
    "their approach combines two steps , see fig .  1 .",
    "first , gaussian states are de - gaussified by an appropriate quantum filter . then",
    ", the states are re - gaussified by an iterative procedure whose each steps involves interference of two copies of a two - mode state on balanced beam splitters , followed by projection of one output on a vacuum , c.f . fig .",
    "it can be rigorously proved that this protocol converges to a gaussian state .",
    "this state , however , will generally be mixed , only under very special conditions the protocol will converge to a pure state .",
    "the distillation procedure thus increases entanglement of the state , but at the same time it reduces purity of the state , as we shall show below .",
    "a possible solution of this problem would be to send through the lossy channel a very weakly entangled pure state whose entanglement could then be increased by distillation @xcite or probabilistic noiseless amplification @xcite while preserving high purity of the state",
    ". however , this approach is not applicable in situations where two distant parties share some fixed noisy entangled states and want to extract pure entangled state without having control over the source of the states .     by local non - gaussian operations ( quantum filters ) @xmath0 .",
    "( b ) iterative gaussification procedure whose single step involves local interference of two copies of a state on balanced beam splitters bs@xmath1 and bs@xmath2 followed by projections of one output mode on each side onto vacuum using photodetectors d@xmath3 and d@xmath4 , respectively . in the protocol , alice and bob use classical communication to announce success or failure of local filtering operations and projections . ]    in this paper we propose a modified and extended version of entanglement distillation protocol for symmetric two - mode gaussian states , which asymptotically converges to a pure gaussian state .",
    "this is a crucial advantage with respect to previously proposed protocols for cv entanglement distillation @xcite and experimentally demonstrated cv entanglement concentration schemes @xcite that can not fully suppress the effect of losses and can not be used to distill _ pure _ entangled gaussian state from noisy weakly entangled gaussian states . the cv entanglement distillation scheme considered in the present paper",
    "has a nested structure .",
    "the whole distillation procedure including non - gaussian filtration and gaussification is performed several times , so that already distilled gaussian states are taken as an input of the next stage of the protocol .",
    "moreover , we significantly alter the non - gaussian part of the protocol .",
    "the de - gaussification is not performed on a single copy , as in previous works @xcite , but two copies of the state are used simultaneously and one of them is consumed by the protocol .",
    "this makes our approach slightly more resource demanding but also enables us to distill gaussian states with any chosen amount of entanglement and an arbitrary high purity .",
    "gaussian states can be succinctly characterized by first and second moments of quadrature operators .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote amplitude and phase quadrature operators of mode @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the quadrature operators satisfy canonical commutation relations @xmath8=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "we collect all operators into a vector @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total number of modes .",
    "the second moments can be collected into a a covariance matrix @xmath11 whose elements are defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the anticommutator .",
    "the first moments @xmath15 can be set to zero by local coherent displacements which do not modify entanglement of the state . in the rest of the paper we will therefore consider only gaussian states with @xmath16 .",
    "let us briefly review the iterative entanglement distillation protocol for gaussian states proposed by browne _",
    "_ @xcite and depicted in fig .",
    "1 . in what follows we will focus on a symmetric protocol . more specifically",
    ", we will assume that a covariance matrix of a two - mode gaussian state @xmath17 shared initially by alice and bob can be expressed as @xmath18 the generalized heisenberg uncertainty relation implies that @xmath19 and @xmath20 must hold .",
    "furthermore , we require that the state is entangled , otherwise any distillation would be pointless .",
    "this yields another constraint @xcite , @xmath21 .",
    "pure two - mode squeezed vacuum state is recovered for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a two - mode squeezing constant .    as shown by lund and ralph @xcite , the entangled state ( [ gamma ] )",
    "can be conveniently represented as a pure two - mode squeezed vacuum state with some squeezing parameter @xmath24 transmitted over a lossy channel with intensity transmittance @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a covariance matrix of two - mode squeezed vacuum and the covariance matrix of vacuum state @xmath28 is an identity matrix .",
    "we immediately obtain expressions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath31 whose inversion gives @xcite @xmath32 the symmetric entanglement distillation protocol depicted in fig .",
    "1 preserves the structure of two - mode state ( [ gamma ] ) while altering the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , or , equivalently the two - mode squeezing @xmath24 and the channel transmittance @xmath25 . as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , a first step of the protocol is probabilistic de - gaussification of the two - mode state by local single - mode filtering operations @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a photon number operator and @xmath35 is some constant .",
    "such operation can be implemented by mixing an ancilla single photon state @xmath36 with a signal beam on an unbalanced beam splitter with carefully chosen transmittance , followed by projection of ancilla output port onto a single - photon state @xcite .",
    "note that we can write @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote annihilation and creation operators .",
    "this suggests that , alternatively , one can coherently combine two sequences of the elementary operations of single - photon addition @xcite and single - photon subtraction @xcite to implement the desired operation @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a feasibility of this latter approach has been demonstrated in a recent experiment where a coherent combination of operations @xmath40 and @xmath41 has been implemented in order to directly test the commutation relations for bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "after local filtering , the resulting states are then re - gaussified by an iterative protocol .",
    "an elementary step of this gaussification procedure consists in local interference of corresponding modes of two copies of the state on balanced beam splitters bs@xmath1 and bs@xmath2 followed by projection of one output port of each beam splitter onto vacuum state , see fig .",
    "mathematically , the gaussification protocol is described by an iterative map @xcite , @xmath42},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes a probabilistic gaussian operation on two copies of a two - mode state @xmath44 . using the labeling of modes as in fig .",
    "1(b ) we can write @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 denotes vacuum state , and @xmath48 stands for a two - mode unitary operation corresponding to interference of two modes on a balanced beam splitter .",
    "if the gaussification procedure converges , then the asymptotic state @xmath49 is gaussian , and its covariance matrix can be determined from a state @xmath50 after the first iteration of @xmath51 .",
    "we use short hand notation @xmath52 for density matrix elements in fock basis .",
    "we define auxiliary matrix @xmath53 covariance matrix @xmath54 of asymptotic gaussian state @xmath49 is then a function of the matrix elements @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",

    "considered here some of the matrix elements are equal to zero , @xmath57 and furthermore @xmath58 . as we shall see",
    "this property is satisfied also by our generalized distillation protocol that will be described in seciton iv .",
    "a crucial observation made by lund and ralph @xcite is that the distillation protocol shown in fig . 1 does not change the value of a parameter",
    "@xmath59 it holds that @xmath60 is the same for an initial noisy gaussian state before distillation @xmath61 and the final distilled gaussian state @xmath49 .",
    "the distillation simultaneously increases both effective two - mode squeezing parameter @xmath24 and effective transmittance @xmath25 while keeping @xmath60 constant .",
    "this clearly increases the entanglement of the state .",
    "however , a simple calculation shows that a purity of the state defined as @xmath62 is reduced by the distillation . for gaussian states it holds that @xmath63 . with the help of formulas ( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ csformula ] ) and ( [ epsdefinition ] ) we obtain @xmath64^{-1}.\\ ] ] since @xmath65 by definition",
    ", @xmath66 is a decreasing function of @xmath24 for a fixed @xmath60 .",
    "this shows that the entanglement distillation protocol decreases state purity .",
    "for symmetric gaussian states ( [ gamma ] ) the von neumann entropy of the state depends only on @xmath66 and is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath66 .",
    "so the distillation also increases von neumann entropy of the two - mode gaussian state .",
    "in order to increase the purity of distilled state while preserving ( or even increasing ) its entanglement , we need to find a way how to reduce the value of parameter @xmath60 .",
    "we seek to achieve this by a suitable modification of the de - gaussification step of the distillation protocol .",
    "we will first consider two simple single - copy strategies .",
    "one option is to replace filter @xmath33 with a single - photon subtraction @xmath67 @xcite .",

    "( [ epsdefinition ] ) we find after lengthy but straightforward calculation that @xmath93 , hence this gaussian operation does not change value of @xmath60 .",
