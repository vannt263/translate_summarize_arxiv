    "although the number of observed short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) is increasing , their central engine is still a big mystery .",
    "a major candidate is coalescence of compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar - mass black holes .",
    "one of the keys to confirm this idea is the formation rate of sgrbs as a function of redshift .",
    "in fact , if sgrbs are truly induced by coalescence of compact objects , the sgrb formation rate will track the star formation rate with some delay time .",
    "further , if this is the case , sgrbs are expected to be accompanied by substantial gravitational - wave emission .",
    "thus , the local sgrb formation rate is directly related to the expected number of gravitational - wave events for the next - generation gravitational - wave detectors such as kagra , advanced - ligo , advanced - virgo and geo .    however , the number of sgrbs with known redshift is very small ( @xmath12 ) so that the formation rate is not easy to estimate .",
    "previous studies have estimated the formation rate assuming the functional form of the formation rate and the luminosity function and fitting the data to derive model parameters @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the result depends on the functional form of the model and has large statistical errors due to the small number of sgrbs used to fit the model .    on the other hand , as to long gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) , the formation rate has been estimated much more precisely and robustly .",
    "this is because the correlation between the spectral peak energy and luminosity was found and used to estimate the redshift of lgrbs without known redshift .",
    "first , @xcite analyzed data of 16 lgrbs observed by _",
    "cgro _ batse and _ bepposax _ with known redshifts , and found the @xmath13 correlation between the @xmath0 and the peak luminosity @xmath1 integrated for 1  s time interval at the peak as , @xmath14 the linear correlation coefficient of the @xmath15 correlation is 0.958 and the chance probability is @xmath16 .",
    "then @xcite checked the properties of the correlation and confirmed its reliability . using this correlation ,",
    "@xcite estimated the redshift for 689 bright batse lgrbs without known redshift and derived the luminosity function and the formation rate .    as to sgrbs , however , due to the small number of the events with known redshifts and the good spectra to determine @xmath0 , it has been difficult to do a similar analysis .",
    "recently , @xcite succeeded in determining @xmath13 correlation for sgrbs .",
    "they used 8 secure sgrbs out of 13 candidates and obtained @xmath17 where @xmath0 is from the time integrated spectrum again while @xmath1 was taken as the luminosity integrated for 64  ms time intervals at the peak considering the shorter duration of sgrb .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient of the @xmath13 correlation is 0.98 and the chance probability is @xmath18 .",
    "although this is not so tight as that for lgrbs due to the fact that the number of sgrbs is half of that of lgrbs , it is accurate enough to use as a redshift indicator for many sgrb events without known redshifts .    in this article , we determine the redshifts of sgrbs observed by batse using the @xmath0@xmath1 correlation mentioned above .",
    "then , we obtain a non - parametric estimate of the luminosity function and sgrb formation rate versus redshift based on much more samples compared with previous studies .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the observations and data analyses .",
    "after that , we show the redshifts estimated by @xmath0@xmath1 correlation for sgrbs , and obtain the cumulative redshift distribution and compare it with the observed one",
    ". we also show the cumulative luminosity function and the sgrb formation rate as a function of redshift with non - parametric method , i.e. without any assumptions on both distributions .",
    " 3 is devoted to discussions and implications of the results .",
    "we used the batse current burst catalog which contains 2704 grbs during its life time ( @xmath19 years ) in orbit .",
    "the average fraction of sky coverage of batse instruments is 0.483 , so the effective life time is @xmath20  years for the entire sky .",
    "we selected events with the short time duration of @xmath21  sec in the observer frame as sgrb candidates . here",
    "@xmath22 is measured as the duration of the time interval during which 90  % of the total observed counts have been detected .",
    "after that , we selected the brightest 100  sgrbs in 1,024  ms peak photon flux .",
    "the peak flux of all events we selected is brighter than @xmath23 .",
    "the trigger efficiency of batse instrument is almost 100  % ( larger than 99.988  % ) , so we can estimate sgrb rate without any correction in this point .",
    "we used spectral data detected by the batse lad detectors and performed the standard data reduction method .",
    "then we succeeded in analyzing spectral data for 72  events .",
    "the other 28 events are statistically poor or the variable background condition , so we failed to obtain spectral parameters for the standard analyses .",
    "we used the spectral model of the smoothly broken power - law model , so called band function @xcite as following ; @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is in unit of @xmath26 .",
    "the spectral parameters of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the low- and high - energy index , and the energy at the spectral break , respectively . for the case of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,",
    "the peak energy can be derived as @xmath32 . in previous work , although @xcite performed spectral analyses for 79 sgrbs with cutoff power - law model , we used the band function for all events in this work because the @xmath0@xmath1 correlation by @xcite is based on the band function .",
    "if we can not determine the high energy spectral index @xmath28 , we fixed the parameter as @xmath33 which is average value of bright events .      for long grbs ,",
    "there are well known correlations between @xmath34 and brightness like amati  yonetoku  ghirlanda correlations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "recently @xcite reported the @xmath34luminosity correlation in sgrbs as equation  [ eq : sgrbeplp ] .",
    "this is @xmath35 times dimmer than the @xmath34luminosity correlation of long grbs ( see equation  [ eq : lgrbeplp ] ) .",
    "this equation can be rewritten as @xmath36 here , the right side of the equation is composed by observed values .",
    "as @xcite performed , using the observed @xmath34 and 64  msec peak flux , we can estimate the pseudo redshift and luminosity distance for each event .",
    "then we used the cosmological parameters of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and hubble parameters of @xmath39 .",
    "we succeeded in calculating all pseudo redshifts for 72 events . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the data distribution on the plane of redshift and 64ms peak luminosity .",
    "the filled squares and circles are known redshift samples with precious spectral parameters ( secure sgrbs by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and pseudo redshift samples , respectively . the error of pseudo redshift is mainly caused by the statistical uncertainty of @xmath34 , and the one of luminosity depends on the estimated redshift .",
    "the solid line is caused by the flux limit which must pass just close to the lowest and the highest data point because of a demand of our method to estimate the sgrb rate and luminosity function .",
    "if not , there is a possibility that the algorithm recognize unmeaning stronger luminosity evolution because of the lack of data around the flux limit . in this analyses , we set the flux limit of @xmath2 to hold the number of data as many as possible .    in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the correlation between the @xmath34 value of this work ( band function ) and the ones of @xcite ( cutoff power - law function : cpl ) .",
    "we confirmed both results strongly correlate with each other while our @xmath34 is slightly smaller than their results .",
    "this result is recognized as the difference of model function as @xcite mentioned .",
    "the cutoff power - law tends to have larger @xmath0 than the band function .    to confirm",
    "if our redshift determination is consistent with one of the known redshift sgrbs , we compared the cumulative redshift distributions of both samples . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the cumulative redshift distribution of 22 observed sgrbs of @xmath40 ( red ) @xcite and our 45 batse sgrbs brighter than the flux limit and with the pseudo redshift of @xmath41 ( black ) in figure  [ fig1 ] , respectively . to keep the shape of cumulative distribution .",
    "finally , we use only 22 sgrbs . ]",
    "the reason we set upper bound of the redshift comes from the small number ( only one ) of the known redshift sgrb larger than @xmath42 .",
    "we performed the kolmogorv - smirnov test between the red and black lines in figure  [ fig3 ] , and it shows the probability of null - hypothesis is 79.4  %",
    ". moreover we estimate possible error region of the cumulative distribution of 45 pseudo redshift samples .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , the estimated redshifts have errors mainly come from @xmath0 errors , so we performed 100 monte carlo simulations for each point and estimated their cumulative redshift distributions .",
    "the results are also shown as gray lines in figure  [ fig3 ] , and we can see the error region well contains the observed distribution ( red line ) . therefore we conclude our estimated redshift distribution is the almost same distribution of observed one , and the @xmath0@xmath1 correlation for sgrbs @xcite is a good distance indicator .",
    "hereafter we use 53 sgrbs above the flux truncation of @xmath2 with maximum redshift @xmath43 to estimate the sgrb formation rate in the next section .      in general , luminosity function",
    "can be written as @xmath44 . here",
    "we named @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the sgrb formation rate , the local luminosity function , and the luminosity evolution , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 means the shape of luminosity function , but we ignore this effect because of the limited number of samples .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to estimate the sgrb rate @xmath49 as a function of only @xmath50 , and the local luminosity function @xmath51 after removing the luminosity evolution effect .",
    "the statistical problem to estimate the true sgrb formation rate and luminosity functions is how to deal the data set truncated by the flux limit . in many cases , assuming some parametric forms ( model functions ) for the luminosity function and redshift distribution , all parameters are simultaneously estimated to fit the data distribution of the flux limited samples . however ,",
    "if we use the model function far from the true distribution , we may obtain unrealistic solutions for each parameters . especially , we have little knowledge about the functional form of sgrb formation rate and it may be different from the general star formation rate . therefore it is preferable to use a non - parametric method .    in this paper",
    ", we used a non - parametric method by @xcite developed to estimate the redshift distribution of distant quasars .",
    "this method is also used in the long grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of methodologies are found in these papers so that we briefly summarized the thread of data analyses to estimate the luminosity function and the sgrb formation rate independently . in this work",
    "we follow the notations and terminologies by @xcite to identify the best luminosity function distribution of @xmath52 ; see their section 4 .",
    "first of all , we estimate the correlation between the redshift and the luminosity ( luminosity evolution ) with the assumption of the functional form of @xmath53 .",
    "then we searched the appropriate @xmath54-value which gives the data distribution on @xmath55 plane has no correlation between them .",
    "then we calculated the @xmath56-statistical value ( similar to kendall @xmath56 rank correlation coefficient ) to measure the correlation degree for the flux truncated data . when the @xmath56 value is zero , it means that the combined luminosity @xmath57 is independent of the redshift @xmath50 ( no luminosity evolution ) .",
    "we estimated @xmath58 with 1  @xmath59 uncertainty , so we can say there is no obvious luminosity evolution ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "next , we can separately calculate the local luminosity function for @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and the sgrb formation rate as a function of redshift with non - parametric method .",
    "we have already removed the effect of luminosity evolution , a unique formula for the luminosity function can be adopted for all redshift range .",
    "then , we can easily estimate the number of events lower than the flux limit . in the same way , we can also estimate the sgrb formation rate .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we show the cumulative luminosity function of @xmath57 .",
    "the red line is the best estimate with the pseudo redshift , and gray lines are results by 100 monte carlo simulations as previously shown . for long grbs",
    ", several authors reported the luminosity function can be described as broken power - law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this analysis for sgrbs , we can not find obvious break structure in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we adopt a simple power - law function , and obtained the best fit index of @xmath63 between the luminosity range of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we can say the luminosity function is consistent with the pure unbroken power - law for @xmath66 .    in figure  [ fig5",
    "] , we show the sgrb formation rate per comoving volume and the proper time as a function of @xmath67 . again , the red line is the best estimate with the pseudo redshift , and gray lines are results by 100 monte carlo simulations . here",
    ", we used the batse s effective observation period of 4.4  years as already explained in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "this sgrb rate is calculated for the events with the peak luminosity of @xmath68 in observer s frame .",
    "the functional form can be described as @xmath69 in units of @xmath70 .",
    "the local minimum event rate at @xmath4 is @xmath71 . here",
    ", in this figure , we assume that the radiation of sgrb s prompt emission is isotropic , and we do not include any geometrical correction for the jet opening angle . in this analysis , we treated sgrb samples with the observed flux larger than @xmath2 and dimmer sgrbs are not included .",
    "therefore the sgrb formation rate estimated here is regarded as the minimum value .",
    "let us assume that progenitor of sgrbs is the merging neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) binary here .",
    "@xcite obtained the probability function of the rate of the merging ns - ns binary taking into account the observed ns - ns binary , the beam factor of the pulsar , pulsar search time , the sensitivity and so on .",
    "they obtained a merging rate of @xmath72 with 99% confidence level .. while @xcite analyzed the pulsar beaming effect with newly found ns - ns binary to obtain the merger rate of ns - ns binary as @xmath73 which is within the 99% confidence level of @xcite . for a review of various estimation of the merging rate ,",
    "see @xcite . from @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ", under the hypothesis that every ns - ns merger produces a short grb , we infer that any beamed emission must be confined to a cone with opening angle greater than @xmath76 determined by @xmath77 then we estimated @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] long grbs(lgrbs ) are believed to be caused by relativistic jets since the break of the afterglow light curves are seen for many lgrbs .",
    "the typical example is grb990510 which shows achromatic break of the afterglow light curve @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for the achromatic break of the light curve comes from the jet dynamics after the relativistic @xmath80 factor of the jet becomes smaller than the inverse of the jet opening angle @xcite .",
    "if sgrbs are also caused by relativistic jets , we can expect a jet break similar to that of lgrbs .",
    "however , so far , only grb  130603b has multi - wavelength data from radio to x - ray to confirm the achromatic jet break of the afterglow .",
    "@xcite determined the jet opening angle of grb  130603b as @xmath81 , where the ambiguity comes from the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the jet and the ambient gas density .",
    "very interestingly , the opening angle of grb  130603b is compatible with the minimum jet opening angle derived in the previous section .    for grb  051221",
    ", the steepening of the afterglow light curve was observed in x - ray band at @xmath82 days .",
    "if we identify this steepening as the jet break , the jet opening angle is determined as @xmath83 @xcite . for grb111020a , @xcite argued a significant break at @xmath84 days in x - ray band and obtained the jet opening angle of @xmath85 .",
    "for grb090426 , @xcite obtained the jet opening angle of @xmath86 from a break at @xmath87 day .",
    "the other jet opening angle information from sgrbs is lower limits ( see section 8.4 of recent review by @xcite ) so that we use only these four estimations of the jet opening angles .",
    "a simple average of these four angles is @xmath9 . taking this value , then , the event rate of sgrb including the off - axis ones becomes @xmath88 .",
    "now let us assume that the central engine of sgrb is a coalescence of a neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) binary .",
    "then , we can obtain an estimate of the event rate of gravitational - wave detection .",
    "the detectable range of kagra , adv - ligo , adv - virgo and geo network is @xmath89 so that the minimum gravitational - wave detection rate is obtained as @xmath90 .",
    "this is an estimate independent of the one based on pulsar observations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the central engine of sgrbs is a coalescence of a black hole - neutron star ( bh - ns ) binary with masses , say @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the detectable range will become @xmath93 times larger because it is proportional to @xmath94 , where the chirp mass @xmath95 of a binary is defined by @xmath96 @xcite where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the masses of each compact object .",
    "in this case , the detection rate will be @xmath99 .    in the above estimation",
    ", we used the batse sgrbs with a flux larger than @xmath2 which is shown by the solid line in figure  [ fig1 ] . as is seen in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ", there are 17 events below the flux limit and the event with the lowest fluxes located a factor of @xmath100 below the solid line .",
    "if we lower the flux limit by a factor of 4 , noting that the cumulative luminosity function is proportional to @xmath101 as seen in figure  [ fig4 ] , we can expect that the event rate can be a factor @xmath100 larger .",
    "then the gravitational - wave detection rate becomes @xmath102 for ns - ns ( ns - bh ) binary , respectively . while @xcite suggested that the likely binary neutron - star detection rate for the advanced ligo - virgo network will be 40 events per year , with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year in their review paper .",
    "@xcite analyzed 14 _ swift _ sgrbs taking into account the ratio of the rate of batse to _ swift _ sgrbs , the k - correction , the maximum distance observed by a certain event , the jet opening angle and the probability of the event being sgrb .",
    "they obtained the event rate of @xmath103@xmath104 for the case of isotropic emission and beamed emission , respectively . in our analysis",
    "the minimum event rate is @xmath105 after the geometrical correction of beaming angle , while the realistic one is @xmath106 .",
    "although both analysis used completely different methods , they are consistent with each other . for ns - ns binary",
    ", the detection range of adv - ligo will be @xmath107 in 2016 - 2017 @xcite so that there is a good chance of the first gravitational wave detection around 2017 .",
