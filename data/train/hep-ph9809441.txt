    "the suppression of heavy quarkonia has long been proposed as a unique signature for the transient creation of a quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "preliminary reports on @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross sections in pb+pb reactions at sps energies @xcite in fact seem to indicate an anomalous charmonium suppression compared to @xmath2 and lighter @xmath3 interactions .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the framework of glauber theory with some comover interactions @xcite fails to describe all the data while assuming the onset of deconfinement at a certain interaction density leads to a better agreement with experiment . starting from a similar ansatz ,",
    "however , it was claimed that hadronic mechanisms alone could account for the observed suppression probabilities @xcite . while in these studies",
    "universal comover absorption cross sections are parameters , there have been attempts to predict the actual comover cross sections for certain reaction channels and to estimate the resulting @xmath0 survival probabilities @xcite . from these studies",
    "one learns that the dissociation cross sections may depend strongly on the scattering energy as well as the meson species interacting with the charmonium state .",
    "unfortunately only _ thermal _ absorption rates have been calculated on the basis of the predicted cross sections .",
    "it is the goal of the present work to investigate , on the basis of a hadronic transport model , if the assumption of a thermal hadronic environment can be justified .",
    "this is analogous to studies of the nonequilibrium processes contributing to strangeness production @xcite versus thermal model calculations @xcite .",
    "scattering rates and collision energies in the microscopic simulation are compared to the ideal hadron gas scenario .",
    "we also address the question of whether only the consideration of light mesons ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) suffices to account for the major part of all possible comover absorption processes .",
    "the production and subsequent absorption of charmonium states in relativistic heavy ion collisions are the result of an intricate interplay between hard and soft processes . since the interactions are nonperturbative",
    "the calculation of their dynamics from first principles is prohibitive .",
    "thus phenomenological models which account for both hadronic and partonic aspects are needed .",
    "we simulate charmonium production and absorption microscopically .",
    "the charmonium states are produced exclusively in hard parton - parton interactions for which a simple glauber - type picture of nucleus - nucleus reactions applies .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the experimentally measured dimuon continuum in the corresponding mass range can be well described by perturbative calculations of the drell - yan process pairs which eventually form the quarkonium state is , however , dominated by gluon - gluon scatterings . ] .",
    "in particular , a linear scaling of the drell - yan cross section with atomic mass @xmath6 is observed in @xmath2 interactions  @xcite .",
    "initial state interactions are assumed to be negligible .",
    "we apply perturbative qcd to nucleus - nucleus collisions without nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the effects of such modifications . )    within perturbative qcd , the hard production process is completely decoupled from other possible interactions such as the creation and reinteraction of soft quarks and gluons and their rearrangement into color singlet states .",
    "in particular , the hard production process is not linked to soft hadron production , baryon stopping and hadronic rescattering .",
    "the dissociation of charmonium states is assumed to be due to hadronic interactions .",
    "the space - time evolution of mesons and baryons , governed by soft physics , can be treated by transport theory on the hadronic level .",
    "the kinetics of each interaction is determined by appropriate hadronic scattering cross sections .",
    "in particular , charmonium dissociation can be studied by introducing cross sections for their absorption through interactions with baryons and mesons . in this work ,",
    "we consider dissociation by comoving mesons only s in nuclear matter .",
    "this will be discussed in @xcite . ] .",
    "technically , we generate a space - time distribution of charmonium production points for any impact parameter @xmath7 by microscopically simulating glauber - type nucleus - nucleus collisions assuming that the nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ sets of appropriately initialized nucleons , pass through each other on straight line trajectories without energy loss .",
    "at the space - time point of each nucleon - nucleon encounter , a charmonium state has a fixed production cross section .    to calculate the rescattering of charmonium states we generate a full hadronic cascade simulation with the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics , urqmd , model @xcite which takes stopping and particle production into account .",
    "the charmonia are inserted into the evolving hadronic environment at the appropriate space - time points according to the glauber simulation of the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the momenta of the charmonium states are assigned from the parametrization @xcite : @xmath8 in principle , the total energy of the produced @xmath9 state has to be subtracted from the overall reaction .",
    "however , it is difficult to do so consistently since simulations of the charmonium production and rescattering processes are formulated within different conceptual frameworks .",
    "therefore we allow for the small violation of energy - momentum conservation imposed by this procedure . in pb+pb collisions at 160  gev / nucleon , @xmath10  gev and with a typical charmonium energy of @xmath11  gev , @xmath12% .    in the simulations",
    "we have used fixed dissociation cross sections , @xmath13 according to the additive quark model , for any meson species @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the total @xmath15 absorption cross section , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath16  mb .",
    "since we do not consider elastic interactions , any collision above the kinematic threshold leads to the dissociation of the @xmath0 so that we use the two terms synonymously . for this study",
    ", we have neglected the energy dependence of the dissociation cross sections which may be quite strong close to threshold .",
    "also , we have not considered a possible ( eigen)time dependence of the actual dissociation cross sections which may evolve from a small initial cross section at the production point to its asymptotic value ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we want to focus on the question of whether or not the @xmath0-comover reactions in a heavy ion collision can be reasonably approximated by a thermal hadron gas interacting with the @xmath0 .",
    "the qualitative answer to this question is rather insensitive to the actual parametrization of the cross section .",
    "note that we do include the formation time of the comovers ( on average , @xmath17",
    "fm/@xmath18 ) .",
    "particles produced in a string fragmentation process are not allowed to interact with each other or with a @xmath0 within their formation time .",
    "dimuon production has been shown to be enhanced by partonic interactions of preformed mesons in a similar context @xcite . ] .",
    "we assume @xmath19  mev is the kinematic threshold for @xmath0-meson dissociation processes . in the thermal model ,",
    "a fixed @xmath5 mass of 770  mev is used , therefore the minimum @xmath20 collision energy is @xmath21 . in the urqmd model however , the finite width of the @xmath5 meson , @xmath22  mev , is taken into account .",
    "the @xmath5 meson mass distribution is selected from the breit - wigner resonance formula .",
    "therefore , in the microscopic model some of the @xmath20 interactions are below threshold while no correpsonding threshold exists for the thermal model .",
    "the results in the equilibrium scenario are easily obtained .",
    "consider an ideal gas of @xmath0 s and one meson species @xmath14 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) .",
    "we calculate the rate @xmath23 of dissociation processes for an arbitrarily chosen @xmath0 in the rest frame of the @xmath0 : @xmath24 where the spin and isospin degeneracy , @xmath25 , is 3 for @xmath4 s and 9 for @xmath5 s .",
    "the mesons are distributed according to the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total energy , @xmath28 is the momentum of mesons in the rest frame of the @xmath0 and @xmath29 is the meson flux .",
    "the dissociation cross section has a fixed value , @xmath30  mb .",
    "the above integral can be rewritten in terms of the center of mass collision energy , @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the ( unnormalized ) collision spectrum for a given temperature @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , the average collision energy is given by @xmath35",
    "we first study very central pb+pb reactions ( @xmath36 ) at @xmath37  gev with the microscopic nonequilibrium model .",
    "figure  [ rates ] shows the @xmath0 dissociation rates as functions of time .",
    "comover dissociation processes occur most frequently about 1  fm/@xmath18 after the nuclear reaction begins . at that time",
    ", the total dissociation rate reaches a value of more than 0.1  @xmath18/fm .",
    "however , it is dropping rapidly , an order of magnitude within the first 10  fm/@xmath18 of the reaction .",
    "the individual @xmath38 and @xmath20 interaction rates are plotted along with the total comover absorption rates .",
    "it is clear that @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s alone are not responsible for @xmath0 dissociation by comovers due to the large number of transient meson renonances present in the microscopic model .",
    "the string fragmentation scheme used in urqmd @xcite determines the relative abundancies of these states .",
    "this choice is far from unique since the model can be compared to data only for the hadrons observable in the final state . in urqmd , all states of eight different meson multiplets ( @xmath39 plus two excited @xmath40 multiplets ) may be populated in a string fragmentation process .",
    "the probability to form a meson from one of these multiplets is chosen to be proportional to the spin degeneracy and inversely proportional to the average mass of the multiplet .",
    "table  [ table ] shows the relative importance of the mesons which contribute most to @xmath0 dissociation .",
    "scatterings of the @xmath0 s with @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s are indeed the dominant dissociation processes . however , together they are responsible for only 37% of the total comover absorption .",
    "twenty channels are left out of table  [ table ] , each of them contributing about 1% or less .",
    "however , they account for more than 15% of the total absorption .",
    "it is important to remember that the same dissociation cross section is used for all @xmath0-meson interactions , most probably a crude approximation . for a better estimate of the @xmath0 dissociation rates",
    ", one would need to calculate the cross sections in all possible channels .",
    "of course , even if this whole set of cross sections was completely determined it is uncertain that the hadronic transport model describes all the details of rescattering correctly . in any case",
    ", it is questionable if a model of @xmath0-comover absorption which includes only the light mesons can be used for reasonable quantitative predictions .",
    "figure  [ ecmt ] shows the average @xmath0-meson collision energies in central pb(160  gev)+pb reactions as functions of time for @xmath38 and @xmath20 interactions .",
    "as one expects , the average collision energies are highest in the early stage of the reaction where the rates are also at their maximum .",
    "we now compare the microscopic nonequilibrium scenario with a thermal meson gas .",
    "figure  [ therm_rates ] shows the rates and the averaged thermal dissociation energies in an ideal gas of @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s as functions of temperature .",
    "the rates in the later stage of the reaction , shown in fig .  [ rates ] , when @xmath41  fm/@xmath18 , correspond to a temperature of @xmath42  mev in the equilibrated system .",
    "the temperatures one would deduce from the collision energies of fig .  [ ecmt ] roughly agree with these values .",
    "thus , the concept of a thermal hadron gas may be approximately valid in the later stage of a nuclear reaction . the survival probability of charmonium states , however , is to a large extent determined by the early reaction dynamics , @xmath43  fm/@xmath18 . here , the rates roughly correspond to a thermal @xmath4 and @xmath5 gas with @xmath44  mev .",
    "in contrast , the average collision energies at this time are much higher than one could ever expect in a thermal hadron gas . as can be read off from fig .",
    "[ ecmt ] and fig .",
    "[ therm_rates ] , the collision energies would correspond to temperatures greater than @xmath45  mev .",
    "we can therefore conclude that a major part of the @xmath0 dissociation processes can not reasonably be approximated by a thermal scenario .",
    "much higher collision energies are observed than can be expected in a thermal system indicating that the underlying @xmath4 and @xmath5 momentum distributions are out of equilibrium and the probability of high relative velocities is enhanced .    the nonequilibrium character of @xmath0 rescattering is also reflected by the time integrated collision energy spectrum .",
    "the prediction of the nonequilibrium model is shown in fig .",
    "[ spec ] , together with the collision spectra of a thermal gas at @xmath46 and @xmath47  mev .",
    "obviously , in the microscopic simulation collisions with high center of mass energy are much more probable than in a thermal hadron gas at reasonable temperatures .",
    "as mentioned above , we have used fixed dissociation cross sections , @xmath30  mb , in this study .",
    "however , absorption by light mesons has recently been calculated in the framework of a meson exchange model @xcite where the cross sections are strongly energy dependent .",
    "thus , at a fixed comover density , the assumption of thermal velocity distributions would considerably underestimate the absorption rates . at @xmath48  gev ,",
    "the energy dependent cross sections of ref .",
    "@xcite are @xmath49  mb and @xmath50  mb . as a result",
    ", using these cross sections @xcite in the nonequilibrium urqmd simulation leads to slightly lower maximum absorption rates at @xmath43  fm/@xmath18 than do the fixed cross sections . in the later stages of the reaction , the energy dependent absorption rates are more strongly suppressed since most of the collisions occur closer to threshold , as shown in fig .",
    "typically , for @xmath51  fm/@xmath18 , the collision energies are @xmath52  gev which implies @xmath53  mb , considerably smaller than the cross sections when @xmath43  fm/@xmath18 .    certainly , different parametrizations of the energy and eigentime dependencies for all possible comover dissociation cross sections would yield different integrated survival probilities . in this work",
    "we explore only the influence of the comover dynamics on the absorption rates .",
    "comparison to experimental data with a refined prescription of charmonium production and absorption in the microscopic framework will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have presented a microscopic model of @xmath0 production and absorption in relativistic heavy ion collisions . averaged dissociation rates and collision energies",
    "have been analyzed as functions of time . in this model ,",
    "scattering of @xmath0 s with @xmath4 s and @xmath5 s account for only about 37% of the total absorption by comovers .",
    "the @xmath0 absorption by comovers is strongly time dependent with dissociation rates peaking at @xmath43  fm/@xmath18 .",
    "the collision energies at that time are much higher than can be expected in a thermal scenario .",
    "an equilibrated gas of light mesons seems to be too simple an approximation to the actual hadronic environment in which @xmath0 s interact . in order to reliably calculate the survival probabilities of charmonium states in heavy ion collisions",
    ", one must employ more realistic simulations of the meson dynamics .",
    "many different reaction channels contribute to the total absorption .",
    "the corresponding dissociation cross sections and their energy dependencies need to be explored further with the help of phenomenological models ."
