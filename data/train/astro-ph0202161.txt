    "the expulsion of a star s outer envelope heralds the end for most stars in our galaxy . for stars like our sun ,",
    "the observed rates at which stars lose their outer envelopes can far exceed the interior nuclear burning rates , causing these stars to wither into white dwarfs .",
    "what physical process initiates this dramatic loss of mass ?",
    "some clues to the mass loss mechanism can come from the morphology of the ejected material . but here lies an additional puzzle .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pns ) , which are the stellar ejecta illuminated by the stellar cores that are rapidly evolving into white dwarfs @xcite , appear to be mostly axially symmetric with subclasses of bipolar and elliptical morphologies @xcite . on the other hand , the ejected circumstellar material of most asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , which are the precursors to pns , appear spherically symmetric as the star sheds its envelope @xcite .",
    "the morphologies of planetary nebulae are predominantly shaped by the agb mass loss and by interaction of that mass loss with a fast wind from the evolving central star .",
    "the axisymmetry of pns may arise when the fast wind expands a hot gas bubble into previously ejected material that has an equatorial density enhancement @xcite .",
    "preferential increases of density at the equator may be created by interactions of the mass loss with a binary companion @xcite or with stellar rotation and a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "proto - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) , which are objects in transition from agb stars to pns @xcite , offer pristine fossil records of the mass loss histories because they predate the fast wind shaping .",
    "observational studies of ppn morphologies have shown that they are inherently axisymmetric @xcite demonstrating that the axisymmetric structures found in pns predate the ppn phase .",
    "axisymmetric pn morphologies are subdivided into bipolar , elliptical and other categories .",
    "based on hst imaging study of 27 ppns , @xcite suggest there are two subclasses of ppn , star - obvious low - level - elongated ( sole ) and dust - prominent longitudinally - extended ( duplex ) , that may be precursors to the elliptical and bipolar pns , respectively .",
    "sole ppns have prominent central stars surrounded by low surface brightness nebulae with single ellipses or sometimes multi - lobed structures .",
    "duplex ppns have spectacular bipolar reflection nebulae with pinched waists and no direct view or a heavily obscured view of the central star .",
    "sole and duplex ppns also appear to differ in three other observational categories .",
    "firstly , for sole ppns , mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) images of the thermal dust emission reveal a toroidal structure embedded in a larger elliptical envelope .",
    "for duplex ppns , the mid - ir emission appears as a bright unresolved core surrounded by a low surface brightness emission @xcite .",
    "secondly , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for sole ppns have roughly equal contributions from the optical and far - infrared . on the other hand , in the seds for duplex nebulae",
    ", the far - infrared contribution dominates over the optical @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the galactic scale height of the sole ppns is larger than that of the duplex ppns which appear to be more confined to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown a similar difference for elliptical pn versus bipolar pn .",
    "these differences are summarized in table [ tabsoledup ] .    in this work",
    ", the differences between sole and duplex ppns are investigated using an axisymmetric radiative transfer code to model the dust shells of two ppns .",
    "section 2 outlines the reasoning behind our choice of objects . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the model calculations and results . in section 4 ,",
    "we compare and discuss the derived physical parameters of the two sources .",
    "section 5 summarizes the conclusions .",
    "in order to solidly substantiate that sole and duplex ppns are physically distinct ppns , as opposed to , e.g. , the same ppn viewed at different inclination angles , detailed model calculations of the entire sample of ppn would be needed .",
    "however , the computation time to accomplish such a task is substantial .",
    "the radiative transfer code that we use takes a few to a few dozen hours to compute one model run and approximately 200 models are run in order to find a best fit .",
    "thus , we have instead pursued a more exploratory approach of modeling one sole ppn and one duplex ppn . in order to have the best constrained model calculations , we have selected two well - studied ppn from the hst imaging sample : hd  161796 , a sole ppn , and iras  17150@xmath03224 ( hereafter iras  17150 ) , a duplex ppn .",
    "these two ppns share a number of properties of other ppns in their class (  1 , @xcite ) , and therefore it is reasonable to expect the results for these objects will be representative of their sole and duplex classes .",
    "these two ppn also have some similarities .",
    "both objects are oxygen - rich and appear to contain silicate dust grains @xcite .",
    "both hd  161796 and iras  17150 appear to be nearly edge - on from their optical and mid - ir images @xcite .",
    "however , their similarities end there .",
    "hd  161796 , which is also known as iras  17436 + 5003 , has a galactic latitude of 30.9   and has most likely evolved from a thick - disk star @xcite . iras  17150 , on the other hand , has a galactic latitude of 3.0   and is thus most certainly a population i object .",
    "the observed properties for these two ppns are listed in table [ tabobsprop ] .",
    "the effective temperatures of the central stars ( t@xmath9 ) are based on spectral types of these stars : f3  ib for hd  161796 @xcite and g2  ia for iras  17150 .",
    "@xcite derived a distance to hd  161796 of @xmath81 kpc which is consistent with the hipparchos results .",
    "the distance to iras  17150 is not as well known .",
    "iras  17150 is located in the plane of our galaxy with a galactic latititude and longitude of 3 , 354   and , thus , we can assign a kinematic distance . using its systemic velocity of @xmath815 km s@xmath3 @xcite",
    ", we find a distance of 3.6 kpc using the rotation curve information derived from hi observations @xcite .",
    "this kinematic distance seems reasonable in light of the resemblance that iras  17150 bears to afgl  2688 @xcite , which has an estimated distance of @xmath81.2 kpc @xcite .",
    "if we assume that iras  17150 and afgl 2688 have comparable luminosities , then we estimate a distance of 3.6 kpc for iras  17150 by comparing their bolometric fluxes .",
    "extinction due to interstellar dust was estimated from the work of @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocities , @xmath10 , are based on co observations .",
    "we note , however , that for iras  17150 , the co observations show a larger expansion velocity of 15 km s@xmath3 compared to the 6 km s@xmath3 of the 1665 mhz oh masers and thus the actual expansion velocity is uncertain due to velocity gradients in this source @xcite but the co observations will be adequate for our comparison of the two objects .",
    "for our modeling , we use a dust radiative transfer code , called @xmath11 .",
    "the computation method is based on the iterative scheme devised by @xcite and follows the principle of long characteristic .",
    "it will be discussed in detail by @xcite . in these calculations",
    ", the central star illuminates an axisymmetric circumstellar dust shell , and the dust shell reddens and scatters the starlight .",
    "self - consistency is achieved through requiring global luminosity constancy at each radial grid point in the dust shell .",
    "the density function of the dust shell is of central interest to this work because it is directly related to the mass loss history of the object .",
    "here we have adopted a density function that can have a toroidal interior , an elliptical ( prolate or oblate ) mid - region , and a spherical outer shell .",
    "this function embodies the idea that mass - loss rate was spherically symmetric on the agb ( m@xmath12 ) and became axisymmetric during the superwind phase ( m@xmath13 ) .",
    "the density functions used in our calculations are shown in figure [ densfunct ] and have the following form :      where @xmath15 is the dust grain mass density at radius @xmath16 and latitude @xmath17 , @xmath18 the dust grain mass density on the polar axis at the inner edge of the envelope , @xmath19 is the inner radius of the shell , @xmath20 is the outer radius of the shell , @xmath21 is the boundary between the spherical agb wind and the axisymmetric superwind .",

    "the degree of equatorial enhancement is set by @xmath26 , where @xmath28 is the equator - to - pole density ratio at @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where the density drop with radius along the equator is steepened by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "the inner torus can be made torus - like or disk - like with @xmath27 , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 define the mid - shell region oblate or prolate .",
    "figure [ densfunct ] also shows the 2-d density functions used in our `` best fit '' models of hd  161796 and iras  17150 .",
    "the user defined constants for the model density functions are listed in table [ tabdensfunct ] .",
    "the @xmath18 is determined by the user specified optical depth at the equator of the dust shell at a specific wavelength and is listed in table [ tabdensfunct ] as @xmath34 at equator .",
    "the properties of the dust grains are also constrained by our modeling . for the grain size distribution , we assume a power law plus exponential fall off    @xmath35    for which a minimum grain size , @xmath36 , and an effective maximum grain size , @xmath37 , are specified , and for which the number of grains larger than @xmath37 is diminishingly small @xcite .",
    "this grain size distribution was derived for the ism and may or may not be appropriate for circumstellar grains .",
    "a theoretical study by @xcite suggests that the grain size distribution created in the circumstellar environments of agb stars has a steeper power law ( @xmath38 ) , however , this parameter has yet to be studied observationally .",
    "the absorption and scattering cross sections are calculated for each wavelength using mie theory and dust optical constants derived from laboratory measurements . for the radiative transfer ,",
    "we consider a fiducial grain which has size - and - composition - averaged cross sections at each wavelength @xcite .",
    "table [ tabdustprop ] lists the dust properties for each source . in a detailed study of hd  161796 s mineralogy , @xcite have determined that amorphous silicates ( mg@xmath39fe@xmath39sio@xmath40 , olivine ) @xcite , water ice @xcite , crystalline forsterite @xcite and crystalline enstatite @xcite are all present in the circumstellar dust shell .",
    "thus , we include all four dust species in our model . for iras  17150 , however , we needed only amorphous silicates ( mg@xmath39fe@xmath39sio@xmath40 , olivine ) @xcite .",
    "we approached the modeling by starting simply and increasing complexity as demanded by the observations .",
    "the seds are fitted first and these constrain the dust opacity ( @xmath41 ) , dust grain composition , luminosity ( @xmath42 ) , stellar and dust temperatures ( @xmath43 ) and inner radius of the dust shell ( @xmath19 ) . the optical and mid - infrared images constrain @xmath29 , @xmath34 , the inclination angle ( _ i _ ) , density function parameters @xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "approximately 300 models were run for iras  17150 and 150 models were run for hd  161796 before convergence on a `` best fit '' model .",
    "we have used earlier versions of this code to model several objects @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite and appendix a of @xcite for further details on the modeling procedure , and to @xcite for details on the effects of a grain - size distribution .    in the following sections , we compare the model sed with spectra and photometry and model images with data images for our two sources , hd  161796 and iras  17150 .",
    "the photometry , spectroscopy and image data are taken from the literature . the derived stellar and dust shell parameters from the models are listed in table [ tabobsprop ] .",
    "the model images have the same pixel scale as the observed images .",

    "the model optical images did not require smoothing for comparison with the hst images .",
    "previous model calculations for hd  161796 have assumed spherical symmetry @xcite and have concentrated on fits to the sed , while here we present the first axisymmetric model for this source and make detailed comparisons with images and the sed .",
    "we compare the data and model results for hd  161796 with images ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796image ] ) and sed ( fig .",

    "the best fit model has an inclination angle of 90   ( see tables [ tabobsprop ] , [ tabdensfunct ] , and [ tabdustprop ] for other model parameters ) .",
    "looking at the images of hd  161796 , one can see how the spectral energy distribution is formed .",
    "the bright central star outshines the low level elliptical reflection nebula in the optical ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796image ] ) .",
    "both the central star and reflection nebulosity contribute significantly to the prominent optical peak in the sed ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796sed ] ) .",
    "the contours of 12.5 @xmath7 m emission show the distribution of thermal radiation from the dust grains and reveal a round dust nebula with two limb brightened peaks located on either side of the central star indicative of an edge - on , optically thin dust torus ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796image ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "an image at 8.5  from @xcite shows that the central star is located at the center of the dust nebula and is used for registration of the v - band and 12.5  images .",
    "the dust shell is responsible for the far - infrared peak in the sed ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796sed ] ) , and the mid - ir emission shown in fig .",
    "[ hd161796image ] arises from the inner edge of this dust shell .",
    "the model images compare reasonably well with the data images ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796image ] ) .",
    "in particular , the star is visible amongst the reflection nebulosity , even in this edge - on configuration .",
    "the model mid - ir emission nebula has a separation of the two limb - brightened peaks that match the data exactly .",
    "indeed , the separation of the two peaks provides a tight constraint on @xmath19 .",
    "the model optical reflection nebula has a comparable relative brightness to the central star as shown by the hst images .",
    "the model image reproduces the elliptical shape of the observed reflection nebula , but extends to a larger radius than observed and appears more rounded in the outer radii . while hst",
    "s wfpc2 psf halo could hide a faint spherical halo around the elliptical reflection nebula , the model images are not a perfect match to the data . in an optically thin nebula , the mid - ir traces the location of the warm dust and the optical reflection nebulosity traces the location of the dust near the central star where densities and optical light intensities are highest . thus some of the slight differences between the model and data images suggest some slight differences between the model and the actual dust density distribution .",
    "for example , the two peaks in the mid - ir nebula are rotated approximately 25   compare to the model and the eastern peak is slightly brighter than the western peak whereas the model shows both peaks at an equal brightness .",
    "this uneveness suggests a slight asymmetry in the axisymmetric dust density distribution or perhaps that the central star is off center and heating the eastern portion to a hotter temperature .",
    "secondly , the mid - ir nebula is more extended than the model nebula which may be in part due to the psf being non - gaussian .",
    "however , a larger mid - ir nebula may be produced if the density drop - off is slower than our model assumes .    drastically changing the inclination angle to our line of sight only worsens the fit to the images .",
    "figure [ hd161796inclang ] shows model images for our best fit model at inclination angles from 0 to 90 . as our view of the nebula changes from edge - on ( 90 ) to pole - on ( 0 ) , the optical reflection nebula changes from an elliptical shape to a circular shape and the two limb - brightened peaks in the mid - ir emission nebula become broader and fade into a circular ring .",
    "while a 90   inclination angle fits the sed and images best , we find that an inclination angle as low as 60   would provide an adequate fit to the data images .",
    "thus , we include an error bar of @xmath4430 .",
    "the model sed is in good agreement with the photometry and iso spectrum of this source ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796sed ] ) and the sed fit is better than , e.g. , that of @xcite .",
    "the iso spectrum @xcite and the model calculations of @xcite have much better spectral resolution than our model .",
    "consequentially , our model shows only the gross dust features such as the broad amorphous silicate bands at 10 and 18 @xmath7 m and the water ice feature at 43@xmath7 m . the crystalline silicate features due to forsterite and enstatite ( 24 and 34@xmath7 m ) , which are reproduced by @xcite , are not reproduced by our model due to the coarse sampling of wavelengths .",
    "the near - ir radiation is slightly over - estimated by our model because the model water ice absorption features in the near - infrared ( 3 , 4.6 , and 6 @xmath7 m ) are too shallow .",
    "our assumed mass fraction of water ice , 2.5% , is substantially less than that of @xcite who found 24% . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "most of the water ice exists as a mantle of crystalline silicate coated dust grains and this dust model causes the mass fraction of water ice to be quite high . in our model calculations , we found that the 43@xmath7 m water ice feature was too pronounced with a 24% mass fraction .",
    "however , the near - ir flux levels were better fit with a 24% mass fraction of water ice .",
    "the mid - ir flux , ( 2040@xmath7 m ) is slightly over - estimated but a higher spectral resolution may resolve this excess into the crystalline silicate features .",
    "the differences between our model results and previous work is in part due to our use of an axisymmetric model , but also in part due to the differences in grain parameters .",
    "@xcite used the astronomical silicate @xcite and an mrn grain size distribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the silicate opacity function of @xcite in their calculations .",
    "@xcite have made the most detailed analysis of the grain mineralogy to date .",
    "they follow the radiative transfer of each grain size and type separately allowing a more careful analysis of grain composition than our averaged - grain - properties approach permits .",
    "when rescaled appropriately for differences in assumed distance , our derived physical parameters are comparable to @xcite but significantly different from those of @xcite . while our luminosity ( l@xmath9@xmath82800 l@xmath2 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath45 cm ) are within 30% of @xcite , our mass - loss rates ( 1.2@xmath46 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ) are a factor of 2 lower than that of @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference is most likely the difference in dust parameters .",
    "our grains sizes ( 0.210.0 @xmath7 m ) are significantly larger than those assumed by @xcite ( 0.0051.0 @xmath7 m ) .",
    "larger grains are more efficient at emitting far - ir radiation and thus our models require less dust mass to create the observed far - ir radiation .",
    "the @xmath29 , luminosity , and mass - loss rates , derived by @xcite are all significantly larger than our values .",
    "the predicted @xmath29 value of @xmath47 cm by @xcite is not consistent with the mid - ir image of @xcite .",
    "this large value for @xmath29 probably forced the value for l@xmath9 higher to create a high enough dust temperature to match the ir emission .",
    "however , in order to match the optical part of the sed @xcite had to include some extinction due to the ism ( a@xmath5= 0.7 ) , which was not needed by our model or the model of @xcite and is not supported by measurements of ism extinction in the direction of this object @xcite .",
    "this comparison demonstrates the importance of imaging for independent constraints of the @xmath29 parameter .",
    "we compare the data and model results for iras  17150 with images ( fig.[ir17150image ] ) and sed ( fig .",
    "[ ir17150sed ] ) .",
    "the best fit model has an inclination angle of 82   ( see tables [ tabobsprop ] , [ tabdensfunct ] , and [ tabdustprop ] for other model parameters ) .",
    "in contrast to hd 161796 , the central star of iras  17150 is completely obscured by the optically thick dusty torus .",
    "instead we see a spectacular bipolar reflection nebula in the b band image ( fig .",
    "[ ir17150image ] ) .",
    "the bipolar reflection nebulosity is the only contributor to the small amount of optical emission in the sed ( fig .",
    "[ ir17150sed ] ) .",

    "the accuracy of this optical and mid - ir registration is limited by the absolute position of the mid - ir image which is known to about 1 , however , it is reasonable to assume that the mid - ir peak is associated with the optically obscuring dusty disk .",
    "this mid - ir emission traces the inner regions of the dust shell which extends beyond the optical reflection nebulosity .",
    "this dust shell , particularly its inner region , absorbs almost all of the star light and re - emits it in the infrared .",

    "the equator - to - pole mass - loss ratio is 160 for iras  17150 and only 9 for hd  161796 . while the mass - loss rates for iras  17150 were higher than for hd  161796 , the durations of the superwind and agb winds are comparable . thus the higher optical depth for iras  17150 compared to hd  161796 is caused by the more intensive mass loss experienced by iras  17150 , particularly during the superwind phase as it ended its life on the agb .",
    "the absolute values for these mass - loss rates depend on the gas - to - dust mass ratio and the distance to the object .",
    "we adopt a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 280 derived for the oh / ir star oh 26.5 + 0.6 by @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that gas - to - dust mass ratios vary by several factors for o - rich agb stars @xcite .",
    "if iras  17150 were actually closer than 3.6 kpc , then the mass - loss rates would be smaller than calculated because mass - loss rates depend on the square of the distance",
    ". however , iras  17150 can not be as close as hd  161796 because then its luminosity would be smaller than that of hd  161796 which is inconsistent with iras  17150 being a population i object and hd  161796 being a thick - disk object .",
    "it could also not be too close because then the mass - loss rates for iras  17150 would be so low compared to hd  161796 that it is hard to explain the silicate absorption feature in iras  17150 .",
    "hence , despite uncertainties in distances , the mass - loss rates for iras  17150 must have been higher than they were for hd  161796 .",
    "the total mass for the circumstellar shell of iras  17150 , 14.0 m@xmath2 , is substantially higher than the mass for hd  161796 , 2.0 m@xmath2 .",
    "this difference in circumstellar mass points to a difference in progenitor - star mass .",
    "if we assume that the central star masses are @xmath57m@xmath2 for hd  161796 and @xmath58m@xmath2 for iras  17150 @xcite , then iras  17150 s progenitor star was much more massive than hd161796 s in agreement with their population i vs. thick - disk classes .",
    "we note that the total mass for iras  17150 ( 15 m@xmath2 ) is higher than typically expected for an intermediate mass star .",
    "given the uncertainties in the gas - to - dust mass ratio and distance for this source , we do not place great significance to this high number ; however , clearly iras  17150 must be on the high mass end of stars that evolve into pns and white dwarfs .",
    "comparison of the figures [ hd161796inclang ] and [ ir17150inclang ] clearly show that you can not view the model for hd  161796 at any inclination angle and see something like iras  17150 .",
    "however , one might be tempted to think that you could view the iras  17150 model pole - on , where the optical depth is low , and see something like hd  161796 . to test this idea ,",
    "we have redisplayed the 0   and 15   inclination angles for the iras  17150 model in figure [ ir17150map_1kpc ] to show the appearance of the structure if the nebula were at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "these images provide a reasonably accurate comparison with hd  161796 because the @xmath29 of the two sources are comparable in our models and thus the ability to resolve @xmath29 would be the same if the objects were at the same distance .",
    "the images in figure [ ir17150map_1kpc ] do not look like the data images for hd  161796 ( fig .",
    "[ hd161796image ] ) and are a considerably poorer match than our optically thin model for hd  161796 . the 0   inclination angle ( fig .",
    "[ ir17150map_1kpc ] ) provides a better match to the optical data than the 15   because the central star is centrally located , as observed ; however , the reflection nebula is perfectly round and has none of the observed ellipticity .",
    "moreover , the mid - ir emission for the 0   image is perfectly round and does not show the two limb brightened peaks . the optical 15   image ( fig .",
    "[ ir17150map_1kpc ] ) reveals more emission on the nw side of the star making the central star appear off - center .",
    "the mid - ir 15   image shows a similar asymmetry as the optical image with one peak located to the nw of the central star location at ( 0,0 ) .",
    "these asymmetries are created by the high optical depths at optical and 9.8 @xmath7 m .",
    "the peak in the mid - ir arises from the warm dust emission on the hotter , inner edge of the optically thick dust torus which we observe through the nw biconal opening that is pointing towards us .",
    "the optical depth in the mid - ir for this source is simply too high to see two limb brightened peaks .",
    "thus the difference in appearance can not be attributed to an inclination angle effect where hd  161796 is viewed pole - on and iras  17150 is viewed edge - on .",
    "rather , we can see the central star of hd  161796 whereas the central star of iras  17150 is invisible because the dust optical depth along the equatorial plane for hd  161796 , a@xmath5=1.4 , is substantially smaller than for iras  17150 , a@xmath5=37 .",
    "this discussion demonstrates the importance of images in differentiating inclination angle effects and dust shell optical depth effects .",
    "in particular , well resolved mid - ir emission images can clearly distinguish between a nearly edge - on optically thin model and a nearly pole - on optically thick model where just seds alone can not .",
    "optically thin , nearly edge - on ppn will show two peaks symmetrically centered on the star .",
    "optically thick , nearly pole - on ppn will show one asymmetric peak or a nearly complete circle .    while inclination angle effects do not explain the differences between hd  161796 and iras  17150 , they are important in modifying the apparent morphology of ppns , particularly the duplex ppns . @xcite show the important effects of inclination angle on the appearance of ppns that we would classify as duplex ppns .",
    "inclination angle effects can cause an ambiguity in classifying a ppn as sole or duplex if the ppn is viewed pole - on . comparing the 0   images of figs .",
    "[ hd161796inclang ] and [ ir17150inclang ] , we find little to distinguish the two subclasses in the optical or mid - ir images .",
    "evolutionary effects could also change appearances because these dust shells are expanding away from the central star and the optical depth of the dust shell is expected to decrease over time changing an optically thick object like iras  17150 into one like hd  161796 .",
    "we compute dynamical ages for each source by dividing the @xmath29 ( table [ tabobsprop ] ) parameter by the expansion velocity ( v@xmath59 , table [ tabobsprop ] ) for each source .",
    "the dynamical ages for both objects , @xmath60 ( table [ tabobsprop ] ) , are short but comparable .",
    "hd  161796 left the agb @xmath8300 years ago . iras  17150 left 210 years ago .",
    "thus , there is little time for an object like iras  17150 to evolve into an object like hd  161796 .",
    "one of the unanticipated results of our modeling was the significant difference in dust composition between hd  161796 and iras  17150 .",
    "hd  161796 has mostly amorphous silicates , but also crystalline silicates and crystalline water ice . in contrast , iras  17150 seems adequately fit with just amorphous silicate , and recent iso spectroscopy presented by @xcite shows no clear evidence for crystalline silicates .",
    "the grain sizes are remarkably different .",
    "iras  17150 has a wide range of grain sizes with the minimum size of 0.001 @xmath7 m and the effective maximum size of 200 @xmath7 m .",
    "hd  161796 has a narrower range of grain sizes with the minimum size of 0.2 @xmath7 m and the effective maximum size of 10.0 @xmath7 m . during our modelling efforts",
    ", we started with a single grain size which proved to be inadequate , in particular for iras  17150 .",
    "we also varied the @xmath36 and @xmath37 values and found them to be quite sensitive ( @xmath810% level ) to the mid - ir and far - ir ends of the sed , respectively .",
    "while the exact values for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are uncertain due to the inexactness of the dust composition , it is unlikely that this uncertainty is large enough to make the possible size distributions for these two objects the same .",
    "the extremely large grain sizes found for iras  17150 are similar to that found for the red rectangle , another duplex object , by @xcite .",
    "large grains were hypothesized to form in the long - lived disk of the red rectangle to explain their presence .",
    "it may be that iras  17150 also has a long lived circumstellar disk .",
    "our model certainly reveals an extreme equatorial density enhancement which is essentially a disk .",
    "however , it is not clear if this disk is gravitationally bound to iras  17150 as it is with the red rectangle and kinematic evidence is needed to establish such a fact .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that ppn with disks have stronger crystalline silicate band strengths than ppn without disks which they classify as outflow sources . in their studies ,",
    "hd  161796 is considered an outflow source which is independently supported by our model calculations . iras  17150 was not included in the study by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hd  161796 has crystalline silicates while iras  17150 does not .",
    "possibly , iras  17150 is early in its evolution and may develop prominent crystalline silicate bands as its central star evolves to hotter temperatures and the disk has time to evolve . in this scenario ,",
    "large dust grains would evolve in the disk before the crystalline silicates .",
    "alternatively , large grains may simply form when mass loss rates are extraordinarily high because the higher densities may create environments conducive for growing large grains . in this scenario ,",
    "crystalline silicates form as the disk evolves .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence .",
    "@xcite has shown that temperature differences between the amorphous and crystalline silicates can hide crystalline silicates in warm shells . in our model of iras  17150 , the optical depth at 25 @xmath7 m is @xmath87 and its possible that this high optical depth veils the crystalline silicate features .      if our model calculations reflect a more general truth about ppns , then there is a real physical difference between the duplex and sole classes of ppn suggested by @xcite .",
    "duplex ppns , such as iras  17150 , originate from more massive progenitor stars than sole ppns , such as hd  161796 .",
    "duplex ppns experience more intensive and equatorially enhanced superwinds than sole ppns .",
    "detailed model calculations of several other ppns by us and others @xcite show similar general differences between sole and duplex ppns , as classified by @xcite .",
    "however , future detailed modeling of other ppn may well reveal ppn with physical parameters that fill - in a spectrum where iras  17150 and hd  161796 mark the extreme end points",
    ".    we might expect there to be subclasses of ppn because there are subclasses of pn morphologies , e.g. bipolar , elliptical , and round @xcite .",
    "bipolar pn originate from higher mass progenitors than elliptical pn as suggested by their differences in galactic scale height @xcite .",
    "higher mass star progenitors of pns are expected to lose mass at higher rates because main sequence stars initially of 0.8 to 8 solar masses become white dwarfs which have masses narrowly peaked at 0.6 solar masses @xcite .",
    "our model calculations presented here support the suggestion of @xcite that duplex and sole ppns are precursors to bipolar and elliptical pns , respectively .",
    "the differences in mass - loss histories between duplex ppns ( bipolar pn ) and sole ppns ( elliptical pn ) may also suggest that there is a difference in mass - loss mechanisms .",
    "progenitor agb stars of duplex ppns have a much more efficient means to loose their outer envelopes than sole ppn progenitors .",
    "it also appears that mass - loss is more efficient when it is axisymmetric .",
    "whether this mass - loss enhancing process is interaction with a binary star companion or magnetic fields , a sudden increase in mass - loss rate coincident with an axisymmetric geometry must be explained .",
    "our radiative transfer models of hd  161796 , a sole ppn , and iras  17150 , a duplex ppn , show that physical differences , not inclination angles , create their observed differences .",
    "hd  161796 and iras  17150 are both viewed nearly edge - on . however , iras  17150 experienced mass loss with a higher rate and with a higher equator - to - pole mass - loss ratio than hd  161796 .",
    "this difference in mass - loss history created a larger optical depth of dust in iras  17150 than in hd  161796 .",
    "if these calculations reflect a more general truth about ppns , then they support the hypothesis put forth by @xcite that sole ppn and duplex ppn are physically distinct subclasses of ppns .",
    "sole ppns are probably descended from lower mass progenitor stars and are the precursors to elliptical pns .",
    "duplex ppns are probably descended from higher mass progenitor stars and are the precursors to bipolar pns .",
    "the dust compositions of both iras  17150 and hd  161796 are dominated by large amorphous silicate grains ; however , the grain sizes have a much larger range for iras  17150 ( 0.001@xmath7 m @xmath61 a @xmath62  200 @xmath7 m ) and hd  161796 contains a significant component of crystalline silicates and water ice",
