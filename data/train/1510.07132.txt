    "<S> this is because the smco q - balls may be considerably larger than a black hole of the same mass , while baryonic matter penetrates the q - ball freely and normally passes through , and only a small fraction of baryons loses the angular momentum in collisions with each other and gets gravitationally trapped in the central part of the smco . </S>",
    "<S> at some stage , this mass gain may force the q - ball to collapse into a black hole , giving rise to a temporal burst of the galaxy s activity . while a detailed quantitative analysis requires complicated large - scale numerical simulations , far beyond the scope of this letter </S>",

    "<S> . they may give birth to supermassive q - balls in galactic centers via the gravothermal collapse , helping at the same time to alleviate some problems of the standard , non - interacting dark matter . </S>",

    "<S> its observations revealed the following facts suggesting that the central object is compact and very massive ( see e.g.ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a recent review ) .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> . infrared observations of stars moving around the central object in ( almost ) keplerian elliptic orbits indicate @xcite that the central mass is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the solar mass , and that this mass is located within the pericenter distance of the s2 star , @xmath4  mpc . expressed in terms of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath5 , of a black hole with the mass @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> this distance is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of matter between the pericenter and apocenter ( @xmath8 ) distances of s2 does not exceed @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> radio observations reveal a strong point - like source , sgr  a@xmath0 , whose position coincides with the focus of the stellar orbits within the experimental precision , dominated by a systematic error between the infrared and radio coordinate reference frames ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> submillimeter observations indicate @xcite that the angular size of the emitting region is @xmath11as , while the expected apparent horizon size of a black hole of mass @xmath6 is @xmath12as , taking into account light deflection in the black - hole gravitational field .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the stars surrounding this radio source move around it at well - detected velocities , the apparent motion of sgr  a@xmath0 itself may be fully accounted for by the rotation of the solar system in the galaxy ; in particular , the source does not move , within the measurement precision , perpendicularly to the galactic plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies @xcite that the mass of the body emitting in radio is @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the steady infrared luminosity of sgr  a@xmath0 is very modest . compared to much stronger radio emission , which presumably originates from the gas falling to smco , </S>",
    "<S> this is often used @xcite as an argument that the central object can not have a surface , because the latter would be heated by the falling gas and shine in the infrared @xmath14 times brighter .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric luminosity of the smco is very low , @xmath15 , compared to the eddington luminosity @xmath16 , typical for powerful active galactic nuclei and set by the balance between the accretion flow and the radiation pressure . </S>",
    "<S> partly , this may be attributed to the lack of material for accretion : recent _ chandra _ observations indicate @xcite that @xmath17 of hot gas per year is available for accretion in the smco sphere of influence . </S>",
    "<S> this amount of matter is insufficient to establish a large - scale accretion disk and would correspond to the bondi accretion rate of @xmath18 times the eddington one . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same observations reveal that less than 1% of this captured matter falls to the smco , so that the inflow of matter is almost balanced by an outflow .    </S>",
    "<S> the extreme compactness of the smco , facts ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) above , as well as the absence of a surface interacting with matter being accreted , fact ( 4 ) , suggest that the galactic central object may be a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , though it is presently unclear how these objects were initially formed in galactic centers ( see e.g.reviews @xcite and below ) . the fact ( 2 ) , that the radio source looks smaller than horizon , shocking at first sight because one would expect the radio emission to come from an extended accretion disk , may be understood ( see e.g.  ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) in a model where the source is a small region at the base of a jet . </S>",
    "<S> however , the jet model has serious tension @xcite with polarization measurements @xcite ; it may also have tension with the fact ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more observational data are required to understand definitely the origin of the radio emission .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact ( 5 ) , that is low efficiency of accretion and radiation , may find its explanation in a variety of complicated models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review . </S>",
    "<S> some of them accomodate inflows and outflows similar to those suggested by the chandra results ; determination of the actual mechanism of accretion awaits further observations .    all these observational results , while being consistent with the smbh hypothesis , do not exclude a less compact object without a surface heated by falling baryonic matter . </S>",
    "<S> alternatives to smbhs have been considered and it has been acknowledged that a compact object made of a scalar field , often called a boson star @xcite , is perhaps the only acceptable known candidate , see e.g.  ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . gravitating </S>",
    "<S> q - balls discussed here represent a subclass of boson stars , though their properties differ drastically from those of cllassical boson - star solutions kept stable by gravity . the alternatives to smbhs </S>",
    "<S> are often disregarded because of the lack of observational reasons favouring them against `` familiar '' black holes , as well as the lack of answers to questions of how they could be formed and why they do not collapse to black holes . </S>",
    "<S> all these reasons are not applicable , however , to the q - ball model discussed below .    _ </S>",
    "<S> * q - balls as smcos . </S>",
    "<S>  * _ nontopological solitons , or q - balls , are compact configurations in scalar field theories whose stability is due to the conservation of a global charge @xcite ( see e.g.a review @xcite and textbooks @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> they received much attention from researchers in field theory and cosmology , but they also have been studied in condensed - matter systems @xcite . for scalar potentials satisfying certain conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the minimal - energy configuration at a fixed charge @xmath19 is compact , that is a q - ball of charge @xmath19 always has lower energy than @xmath19 free particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is guaranteed by typical power - law dependence of the q - ball mass @xmath6 on its charge , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is some model - dependent dimensionful parameter of the potential and @xmath22 ( i use the same notation , @xmath6 , for the mass of the galactic smco and for a generic q - ball mass ; universal units , @xmath23 , are used ) . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the soliton @xmath24 is also determined by its charge , @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> these nontopological solitons may be macroscopic classical objects ( see , however , an example of particle - like q - balls in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and may play a role of smcos . if a giant q - ball resides in the milky - way center , it has to satisfy several constraints in order to explain observational data . </S>",
    "<S> first , it should not be too compact ( and collapse into a black hole ) , but at the same time should not be too large ( and disturb the s2-star results , fact ( 1 ) ) . only in a few cases </S>",
    "<S> explicit solutions for gravitating q - balls were constructed . however , general arguments suggest @xcite ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) that the q - ball collapses to a black hole when its radius @xmath24 is of order the gravitational radius , @xmath26 , for its mass @xmath6 ( here @xmath27 is the gravitational constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore obtain a very general constraint on the parameters of a putative q - ball in the milky - way center , @xmath28 where the last inequality involves the pericenter distance of the s2 star . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath29 and @xmath30 dependencies relate @xmath6 and @xmath24 , this condition may be formulated in terms of the known smco mass @xmath6 and the potential parameter @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , the fact ( 4 ) requires that the q - ball does not have a surface interacting with baryons and emitting heat . </S>",
    "<S> this does not mean it should have a horizon : the field @xmath1 can simply not interact with baryons , or have a very weak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this would make it possible for the accreting matter to penetrate inside ( and to go through ) the smco , thus explaining the absence of thermal emission from the surface . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the smco is much larger than a black hole of the same mass ( large compared to the expected size of the accretion disk , say , @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> most part of the falling baryonic matter simply passes through the q - ball , providing for an outflow which balances the inflow , fact ( 5 ) </S>",
    "<S> . a small fraction of baryons , however , may experience collisions between themselves and lose angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> it is this matter which concentrates in the inner part of the q - ball and forms the radio source , whose size may be smaller than the horizon size of the would - be black hole with the full smco mass , fact ( 2 ) ( see fig.[fig : sketch ] ) .     a sketch of the proposed smco . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line represents the horizon which a black hole of mass @xmath6 would have . </S>",
    "<S> the actual smco of mass @xmath6 , the q - ball , is larger . </S>",
    "<S> baryonic matter may pass through it , giving rise to inflows and outflows , while a small fraction of baryons lose their angular momentum and are captured inside , forming a relatively small radio - emitting blob . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the possibility to have a radio source of sgr  a@xmath32 inside a q - ball was recognized , without a discussion , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while orbits of test particles penetrating a q - ball were studied in ref .  @xcite . during the lifetime of the galaxy , the mass of this central baryonic blob grows and may become comparable to the q - ball mass , fact ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the lower limit on the mass of the radio source , fact ( 3 ) , may be relaxed in this case due to its central location . eventually , the mass of the entire central object ( the q - ball plus captured baryons ) exceeds the stability limit , and the smco collapses into smbh . </S>",
    "<S> one may speculate that the drastic change in the accretion process , associated with this transition , triggers the activity of the galaxy , which returns to a quiscent state after stationary accretion to a newborn black hole settles down . </S>",
    "<S> this would relate the variety in activity of galactic nuclei to the variety of their central objects and explain why active galaxies are rare , though a detailed study of this prospect is beyond the scope of this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that the q - balls not only fit all observational constraints on the galactic smco , but may explain easily some of peculiar phenomena seen in the milky - way center . </S>",

    "<S> the bulk of produced q - balls may form the standard dark matter , while a small fraction of them ( more precisely , those q - balls which contribute a small fraction to @xmath40 ) play the role of usidm . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to estimate @xcite the distribution of the q - balls in @xmath19 ; while small q - balls are born more frequently , they carry a minor fraction of @xmath40 . requiring @xmath85 and @xmath86  @xmath45/g , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the bound @xmath87  kev . recalling that the cosmological constraint was a rough order - of - magnitude estimate </S>",
    "<S> only , we conclude that the model with @xmath88  kev may be capable of producing the dark - matter q - balls and the q - ball milky - way smco at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains to be studied how the q - ball of radius @xmath89 would change the accretion process with respect to a black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , detailed quantitative studies , which might require full - scale computer simulations , are necessary to fully understand details of birth and subsequent evolution of the dark - matter q - ball system . </S>",
    "<S> however , our order - of - magnitude estimates demonstrate that this interesting scenario may be viable .    _ </S>",
    "<S> * future tests of the model .  * _ it would be difficult to test the proposed scenario by direct searches for the dark - matter q - balls , e.g. @xcite : their number density in the universe is very low while the interaction with normal matter is very weak , if any . </S>",
    "<S> detailed studies in particular models might reveal observable signatures of intermediate - mass q - balls , if they are produced . </S>",
    "<S> model - dependent signatures may be found also for gravitational - wave astronomy , coming both from the primordial formation of q - balls @xcite and from the smco @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , definitive tests will be provided by high - resolution observations of the milky - way central object .    </S>",
    "<S> for instance , when the g2 dusty object @xcite has been discovered on its way to the milky - way smco , orders - of - magnitude increase in the accretion rate , and a corresponding burst of luminosity of sgr  a@xmath0 , were predicted . </S>",
    "<S> this extended object has been already observed after passing the pericenter , tidally disturbed but without any sign of increased accretion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further observations will help to understand its nature and to shed light on the details of the accretion process .    the event horizon telescope @xcite , an earth - size radio interferometer working at the frequency of 1.3  mm , might be able to resolve the black - hole shadow , if the milky - way smco is a black hole , in a few years . </S>",
    "<S> future `` millimetron '' spaceborn interferometer @xcite would be able to have horizon - scale resolution for dozens of nearby smcos , and its observations would establish the nature of supermassive objects in galactic centers .    _ </S>",
