    ", the dynamics may result in bistability , i.e. , the existence of two stable steady states for the same parameter values @xcite .",
    "bistability , in general , is an outcome of dynamics involving positive feedback and sufficient nonlinearity .",
    "one way of achieving the latter condition is when multiple bindings of regulatory molecules occur at the promoter region of the gene ( cooperativity in regulation ) or when the regulatory proteins form multimers like dimers and tetramers which then bind the specific regions of the dna @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of bistability in gene expression is that of a gene the protein product of which promotes its own synthesis @xcite .",
    "positive autoregulation occurs via the binding of protein dimers at the promoter region resulting in the activation of gene expression .",

    "a number of synthetic circuits have also been constructed which exhibit bistable gene expression under appropriate conditions @xcite .    recently , tan et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a new mechanism by which bistability arises , termed emergent bistability , in which a noncooperative positive feedback circuit combined with circuit induced growth retardation of the embedding cell give rise to two stable expression states .",
    "the novel type of bistability was demonstrated in a synthetic gene circuit consisting of a single positive feedback loop in which the protein product x of a gene promotes its own synthesis in a noncooperative manner .",
    "if the circuit is considered in isolation , one obtains monostability , i.e. , a single stable steady state . in the actual system ,",
    "the production of protein x has a retarding effect on the growth of the host cell so that the circuit function is linked to cellular growth .",
    "the protein decay rate has , in general , two components , the natural degradation rate and the dilution rate due to cell growth .",
    "since the latter is reduced on increased protein production , a second positive feedback loop is effectively generated , as illustrated in fig .",
    "an increased synthesis of protein x leads to a lower dilution rate , i.e. , a greater accumulation of the protein which in turn promotes a higher amount of protein production . tan et al .",

    "the parameter @xmath3 is the rate constant associated with basal gene expression , @xmath4 represents the effective rate constant for protein synthesis , @xmath5 denotes the maximum dilution rate due to cell growth and @xmath6 is a parameter denoting the ` metabolic burden ' .",
    "when limited resources are available to the cell , the synthesis of proteins imposes a metabolic cost , i.e. , the availability of resources for cellular growth is reduced .",
    "the form of the nonlinear decay rate ( the second term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) is arrived at using the monod model @xcite which takes into account the effect of resource or nutrient limitation on the growth of a cell population .",
    "an alternative explanation for the origin of the nonlinear protein decay rate is based on the fact that the synthesis of a protein may retard cell growth if it is toxic to the cell @xcite .",
    "the experimental signature of bistability lies in the coexistence of two subpopulations with low and high protein levels . in the case of deterministic dynamics",
    ", the cellular choice between two stable expression states is dictated by the previous history of the system @xcite .",
    "in this picture , if the cells in a population are in the same initial state , the steady state should be the same in each cell .",
    "the experimental observation of population heterogeneity in the form of two distinct subpopulations can be explained once the stochastic nature of gene expression @xcite is taken into account .",
    "bistable gene expression is characterized by the existence of two stable steady states separated by an unstable steady state .",
    "a transition from the low to the high expression state , say , is brought about once the fluctuations associated with the low expression level cross the threshold set by the protein concentration in the unstable steady state @xcite .",
    "noise - induced transitions between the stable expression states give rise to a bimodal distribution in the protein levels . in a landscape picture",
    ", the two stable expression states correspond to the two minima of an expression potential and the unstable steady state is associated with the top of the barrier separating the two valleys @xcite .",
    "a number of examples is now known which illustrate the operation of stochastic genetic switches between well - defined expression states @xcite .",
    "stochasticity in gene expression has different possible origins , both intrinsic and extrinsic .",
    "the biochemical events ( reactions ) involved in gene expression are probabilistic in nature giving rise to fluctuations ( noise ) around mean mrna and protein levels .",
    "the randomness in the timing of a reaction arises from the fact that the reactants have to collide with each other and the energy barrier separating the reactants from the product state has to be crossed for the occurrence of the reaction .",
    "the stochastic time evolution of the system can be studied using the master equation ( me ) approach @xcite .",
    "the me is a differential equation describing the temporal rate of change of the probability that the system is in a specific state at time t. the state at time t is described in terms of the number of biomolecules ( mrnas , proteins etc . )",
    "present in the system at t. the solution of the me gives a knowledge of the probability distribution the lower two moments of which yield the mean and the variance .",
    "one is often interested in the steady state solution of the me , i.e. , when the temporal rate of change of the probability is zero .",
    "the me has exact , analytical solutions only in the cases of simple biochemical kinetics . a rigorous simulation technique based on the gillespie algorithm @xcite provides a numerical solution of the me .",
    "the computational cost in terms of time and computer memory can , however , become prohibitive as the complexity of the system studied increases . two approximate methods for the study of stochastic processes",
    "are based on the langevin and fokker - planck ( fp ) equations @xcite .",
    "these equations are strictly valid in the case of large numbers of molecules so that a continuous approximation is justified and the system state is defined in terms of concentrations of molecules rather than numbers . in fact , both the equations are obtained from the me in the large molecular number limit . in the langevin equation ( le )",
