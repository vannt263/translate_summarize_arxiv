    "we are interested in the evolution of certain statistically symmetric random structures , extended over a large finite set of points , when points are progressively removed in a way which depends on the structure .",
    "the initial condition of the structure may allow few possibilities for the removal of points , indeed it may be that , once a small proportion of points are removed , the process terminates .",
    "on the other hand , the removal of points may cause the structure to ripen , eventually yielding a large proportion of the initial points .",
    "our analysis will enable us to demonstrate a sharp transition between these two sorts of behaviour as certain parameters pass through critical values .",
    "let us illustrate this phenomenon by a simple special case .",
    "consider the complete graph on @xmath5 vertices and declare each vertex to be open with probability @xmath13 , each edge to be open with probability @xmath14 .",
    "suppose that we are allowed to select an open vertex , remove it , and declare open any other vertices sharing an open edge with the selected vertex .",
    "if we continue in this way until no open vertices remain , we eventually remove every vertex connected to an open vertex by open edges .",
    "we shall see that the proportion of vertices thus removed converges in probability as @xmath15 and that the limit @xmath16 is the unique root in @xmath17 of the equation @xmath18 thus , for small values of @xmath13 , there is a dramatic change in behaviour as @xmath19 passes through 1 . as @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , @xmath22 but for @xmath23 @xmath24 of course",
    "this is a reflection of well known connectivity properties of random graphs , discovered by erds and rnyi @xcite , and discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the class of models considered in this paper is a natural generalization of some classical models of random graphs and hypergraphs , which may be further motivated as follows .",
    "phase transitions in combinatorial problems constitute an area of active research among computer scientists .",
    "many `` hard '' combinatorial problems can be cast as _ satisfiability _ problems , which seek to assign a truth value to each of a set of boolean variables , such that a collection of logical conjunctions are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "phase transitions for random satisfiability ( `` random k - sat '' ) problems have been studied by researchers at microsoft @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and ibm @xcite , but difficult questions remain unanswered .",
    "the random hypergraph model herein may be viewed as a simplification of the random satisfiability model : a vertex corresponds to a boolean variable , and a hyperedge to the set of variables appearing in a specific logical conjunction , neglecting the truth or falsehood assigned to those variables . under this simplification ,",
    "definitive critical parameters are obtained which shed light on the random satisfiability model , and whose derivation may serve as a template for analysis of mixed satisfiability problems .",

    "on @xmath4 we mean any map @xmath25 here @xmath26 denotes the set of non - negative integers .",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for an overview of the theory of hypergraphs : however the direction pursued here is largely independent of previous work .",
    "we emphasise that , in distinction to much of the combinatorial literature on hypergraphs , we allow the possibility that more than one edge is assigned to a given subset , thus we are considering multi - hypergraphs .",
    "moreover we do not insist that all hyperedges have the same number number of vertices .",
    "much of the literature is restricted to this _ uniform _ case .",
    "our methods allow a significant broadening of the class of models for which asymptotic computations are feasible .",

    "there is more than one interesting counterpart of connectivity . given a hypergraph @xmath3 on a set @xmath4",
    ", we say that a vertex @xmath0 is _ accessible in @xmath30 step _ or , equivalently , _",
    "identifiable in @xmath30 step _ if @xmath31 .",
    "we say , for @xmath32 , that a vertex is _ accessible in @xmath1 steps _ if it belongs to some subset @xmath10 with @xmath33 , _ some _ other element of which is accessible in less than @xmath1 steps .",
    "a vertex is _ accessible _ if it is accessible in @xmath1 steps for some @xmath34 .    on the other hand",
    ", we say that a vertex is _ identifiable in @xmath1 steps _ if it belongs to some subset @xmath10 with @xmath33 , _ all _ of whose other elements are identifiable in less than @xmath1 steps .",
    "a vertex is _ identifiable _ if it is identifiable in @xmath1 steps for some @xmath34 .",
    "the notion of accessibility may be appropriate to some physical models similar to percolation , whereas identifiability is more relevant to knowledge - based structures .",
    "we shall examine only the notion of identifiability .    given a hypergraph @xmath3 without patches and a distinguished vertex @xmath35",
    ", we say that a vertex @xmath0 is _ accessible from @xmath35 _ if it is accessible in the hypergraph @xmath36 , that is , in the hypergraph obtained from @xmath3 by adding a single patch at @xmath35 .",
    "identifiability from @xmath35 is defined similarly .",
    "the set of vertices accessible from @xmath35 is the _ component _ of @xmath35 , as studied in @xcite .",
    "the set of vertices identifiable from @xmath35 is the _ domain _ of @xmath35 , as studied by levin and the current authors @xcite .",
    "we shall not consider further in this paper these vertex - based notions .",
    "the process of identification is dual to the process leading to the 2-core of a graph or hypergraph , that is to say , the maximal subgraph in which every non - isolated vertex has degree at least 2 . in the former process one",
    "removes vertices having a 1-hyperedge , in the latter one removes edges containing a vertex of degree one . in this duality ,",
    "non - identifiable vertices correspond to the 2-core .",
    "thus our results may be interpreted as giving the asymptotic size of the 2-core for a certain class of random hypergraphs .",
    "it will be helpful to think of the identification of vertices as a progressive activity .",
    "once a vertex is identified , it is _ removed _ or _ deleted _ from the vertex set , in a manner which is explained below .",
    "thus , we shall consider an evolution of hypergraphs by the removal of vertices over which there is a patch .",
    "a hypergraph with no patches will therefore be _",
    "stable_. given a hypergraph @xmath3 and a vertex @xmath0 , we can arrive at a new hypergraph @xmath37 by removing @xmath0 from each of the hyperedges of @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath38 for example , in figure [ f1 ] , the patch on the central vertex is selected , and that vertex is removed ; this causes a triangular face to collapse to an edge , and two edges incident to the vertex to collapse to patches on the vertices at the other ends .",
    "note that this leaves two patches on the lower left vertex .",
    "if @xmath39 then we say that @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath3 by a ( _ permitted _ ) _ collapse_. starting from @xmath3 , we can obtain , by a finite sequence of collapses , a stable hypergraph @xmath40 .",
    "denote by @xmath41 the set of vertices removed in passing from @xmath3 to @xmath40 .",
    "the elements of @xmath41 are the identifiable vertices .",
    "we write @xmath42 for the _ identifiable hypergraph _ , given by @xmath43 we note that @xmath41 , and hence @xmath42 and @xmath40 , do not depend on the particular sequence of collapses chosen . for , if @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two such sequences , and if @xmath46 for all @xmath47 , then we can take @xmath1 minimal and find @xmath47 such that @xmath48 ; then , with an obvious notation , @xmath49 , so @xmath50 must , after all , appear in the terminating sequence @xmath45 , a contradiction .",
    "we note also that @xmath41 increases with @xmath3 .",
    "the main question we shall address is to determine the asymptotic sizes of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for certain generic random hypergraphs , as the number of vertices becomes large .",
    "we note that , since the number of hyperedges is conserved in each collapse , all the identifiable hyperedges eventually turn to debris : @xmath51    note that @xmath41 depends only on @xmath52 . in the case where @xmath53 for @xmath54 , the hypergraph min@xmath55 may be considered as a graph on @xmath4 equipped with a number of distinguished vertices",
    ". then @xmath41 is precisely the set of vertices connected in the graph to one of these distinguished vertices .",
    "let @xmath56 be a probability space .",
    "a _ random hypergraph _ on @xmath4 is a measurable map @xmath57 an introduction to random hypergraphs may be found in @xcite , though we shall pursue rather different questions here .",
