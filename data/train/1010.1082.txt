    "sunspots are the manifestation of strong magnetic fields that emerge in the solar photosphere ( @xcite , ) .",
    "although sunspots are stable configurations when compared to the dynamical time scales of other features on the sun , the observed umbral and penumbral fine - structures are very dynamic and subjected to constant change and transformation on small spatial scales .",
    "our understanding of these processes and the nature of the fine structures improved significantly in the last decade ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but we still lack detailed knowledge about the key process of penumbral formation and decay .",
    "observations of this process are very rare , most prominent among them are by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of them observe the formation of a penumbra happening in few hours time . in all the cases they suggest the onset of penumbral formation is due the flux emergence .",
    "@xcite suggests critical flux limit of @xmath1 mx for initiation of penumbra . here in this paper",
    "we discuss multi - wavelength observations of the formation of penumbrae in the active region noaa 10838 which was carried out on 2005 december 22 . coincidentally",
    ", a c-2.9 class flare was also observed in the same active region .",

    "the formation of the penumbra was observed on the leading sunspot of the active region noaa 10838 on 2005 december 22 at the dunn solar telescope in sunspot , nm , usa .",
    "the observed sunspot was situated at @xmath2  ( n15.5 e35.4 ) on the solar disk .",
    "the atmospheric seeing was moderate during the observation .",
    "the adaptive optics system at the dst ( @xcite ) was operated and the atmospheric seeing corrected beam was fed to a set of back - end instruments .",
    "the main back - end instruments used were : diffraction limited spectro - polarimeter ( dlsp ; @xcite ) and universal birefringent filter ( ubf ; @xcite ) .",
    "dlsp was used to obtain stokes profiles of two magnetically sensitive lines ,  @xmath3   and @xmath4  .",
    "the stokes profiles were inverted with an assumption of milne - eddington atmosphere using the hao inversion code .",
    "the magnetic field vector components were transformed from observer s to heliographic co - ordinates using simple spherical trigonometric transformations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the ubf is a tunable lyot filter with a pass - band that varies between 120 to 250 m  in the visible wavelength of 5000 to 7000  .",
    "the ubf was tuned in to two different spectral lines namely ,  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 .",
    "we have also used the archived data from eit and mdi onboard soho satellite , during the same observation time , to study the loop dynamics during the flare .",
    "eit and mdi data were calibrated and matched each other using standard codes available in the ssw software package .",
    "magnetic field contours derived from mdi were overplotted on eit images . to bring up the loop structure ,",
    "a time averaged eit image was subtracted from each frame and the intensity level contours were overplotted .",
    "we have observed the formation of penumbrae , and a flare happening simultaneously .",
    "preliminary results suggests a relation between the two .",
    "top row of the figure  [ fig1 ] shows the magnetic filed orientations at three raster scan maps .",
    "the colour code is used for vertical field strength and the arrows represent horizontal field .",
    "dark solid contours mark the roi , selected manually , where penumbral formation happens , and are marked as * p1 * and * p2*. four umbral areas are selected using the intensity values ( less than 0.7 @xmath7 where @xmath7 is the quite sun mean intensity ) , and are marked in white contours .",
    "u1 , u2 and u3 are the bottom left , top left , and top right umbrae respectively .",
    "the bottom right umbra undergoes lot of changes , in shape and area , and many other small pores come and join .",
    "hence all the umbral area other than u1 , u2 and u3 are marked as u4 .",
    "apart from the bottom right umbra seen in first column , small pores which later join this spot are all grouped under u4 . in the second row",
    "the horizontal field vector is overplotted on  line core images obtained using ubf at similar time of the respective raster scan .",
    "the flare can be seen as high intensity values in  images . in the third row",
    "horizontal field vector is overplotted on continuum raster scan image .",
    "the formation of penumbra is clearly visible in the continuum images .",
    "it is clear from the middle and bottom row images that the horizontal vectors match quite well with the magnetic structures like penumbra seen in continuum images and the super penumbral structures in  line core images .",
    "this suggest that the performed analyses , like inversions , azimuth ambiguity corrections and coordinate transformation from observers to heliographic co - ordinate were proper .",
    "the arrows , representing the horizontal magnetic field , show a twisted field orientation in first two maps ( first and second column of figure  [ fig1 ] ) , and as the flare happens , the field lines untwist to a more potential like nature as seen in third column .",
    "the global alpha value , @xmath8 , which is a measure of magnetic field twist was estimated ( see for e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath8 of this sunspot reduces from @xmath9 to @xmath10 as the penumbrae forms .",
    "the reduction in the @xmath8 shows the relaxation of magnetic field configuration at the photosphere , due to the flare .",
    "the flare was of c-2.9 class as measured by goes .",
    "flare started at around 16:32 ut and peaked at around 16:50 ut .",
    "the total longitudinal magnetic flux ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fill fraction , @xmath13 is the area and @xmath14 is the longitudinal magnetic field intensity ) of this spot is of the order @xmath15 mx .",
    "it s little higher than the critical limit of @xmath16mx needed for penumbral formation as suggested by @xcite .",
    "there is an increase in the flux majorly due to similar polarity pores joining the main spot in u4 .",
    "the flux values of four umbral region and the penumbral forming region are tabulated in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "apart from the flux values one also have to consider the twisted configuration of the magnetic fields .",
    "we believe that , in this case , the flare which transformed the twisted field structure to a more potential nature might have triggered the formation of penumbra .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] gives the five images taken using eit , with @xmath20 12 minutes cadence .",
    "the white contours shows the loops , and the blue and red contours represent the negative and positive magnetic field strength , derived from mdi , respectively .",
    "the images were taken close to the peak of the flare .",
    "the images show untwisting of large loops , in the same direction as seen in the photosphere vector magnetic field configuration .",
    "similar untwisting is also seen in  time sequence movie .",
    "it suggest that the untwisting of magnetic field and the subsequent relaxation happens all the way from corona to photosphere .",
    "we conclude that , observation of this particular event on this sunspot suggest a relation between flare and penumbral formation . apart from the coincidence of both events , the observation also confirms the magnetic field re - orientation , all the way from corona to photosphere . hence , we speculate that the penumbral formation may not be simply a photospheric phenomena but a result of global reconfiguration of magnetic field due to activities like a flare . +",
