    "in addition to the main goal of identifying a light higgs boson  @xcite , an important challenge of the lhc is the observation of clear signals of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in fact , the general consensus is that the sm is not the ultimate theory for strong and electroweak interactions , and many models have been proposed throughout the last three decades attempting to solve existing theoretical puzzles such as hierarchy problems , replication of fermion families , coupling unification , etc  @xcite .",
    "since most of these models include new physics already at the tev scale , it is likely that the corresponding effects could be observed at the lhc at 100  fb@xmath4 luminosity . in general ,",
    "the various theories of new physics predict the presence of new ( `` exotic '' ) fermions , gauge bosons and scalar bosons .",
    "in particular , many models include exotic @xmath0 quarks with electromagnetic charge @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this is e.g.  the case of little higgs theories  @xcite , in which an extra @xmath0 is introduced in order to cancel the quadratic divergence in the higgs selfenergy coming from the ordinary top quark , and the case of theories including extra dimensions , in which one has towers of quark singlets @xmath6 that can be associated to the left and right handed components of the sm top quark  @xcite .",
    "extra @xmath0 quarks are also predicted in the context of `` 331 '' models , in which the standard su(2)@xmath7 electroweak gauge symmetry is enlarged to su(3)@xmath8  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "extra fermions have to be added to the ordinary sm quarks in order to complete the corresponding su(3)@xmath9 triplets . in the lhc",
    ", a pair of these exotic fermions can be produced through gluon fusion or quark - antiquark annihilation  @xcite in the reaction @xmath10 , or a single @xmath0 quark can come out through the reaction",
    "@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "estimations in refs .",
    "@xcite show that these reactions can be distinguished in the lhc at @xmath12 luminosity , even for exotic fermion masses of the order of 1 tev .",
    "the corresponding background is basically given by sm top quark production , offering the possibility of finding a clear signature of new physics  @xcite .",
    "thus , the analysis of @xmath0 production and decay in definite models is a subject that deserves detailed study .    in this work we concentrate on the study of @xmath0 phenomenology in 331-symmetric models .",
    "these schemes offer an explanation to the puzzle of family replication , since the requirements of anomaly cancellation imply a relation between the number of fermion families and the number of colors  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in this context it is possible to fit the observed neutrino masses and mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "owing to the enlarged gauge symmetry , the models include new gauge bosons and exotic quarks that behave as singlets under standard su(2)@xmath9 transformations .",
    "different classes of 331 models include either new quarks with ordinary 2/3 and -1/3 electric charges or even more exotic fermions with charges 5/3 and -4/3 that come together with doubly charged gauge bosons and scalar fields ( in fact , this is the case of the original versions of the model , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to break the gauge symmetry",
    "it is necessary to introduce a minimal scalar sector of two triplets ( this is called the `` economical '' model  @xcite ) , while other 331 models consider three scalar triplets and even an additional scalar su(3)@xmath9 sextet  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in studying the presence of an exotic top - like quark , we consider here a 331 model in which fermions have ordinary electric charges  @xcite .",
    "we take into account the general situation of a scalar sector that includes three triplets , analyzing the couplings of the @xmath0 with the gauge bosons and the experimental constraints on the mixing angles between the @xmath0 and the ordinary quarks .",
    "these bounds allow us to constrain the expected widths for @xmath0 decays into @xmath2 and @xmath13 states for definite values of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "finally , we consider the yukawa sector of the model , studying the decays of the @xmath0 into an ordinary quark and a neutral or charged scalar boson .",
    "the predictions for the relative magnitude of these decays depends on several unknown model parameters .",

    "the values in the table have been obtained after many assumptions and approximations , therefore they should be taken only as illustrative . however , since this corresponds to a plausible scenario , it is interesting to notice that the decays into scalars might be the most important ones in the search for an exotic @xmath0 quark .",

    "in summary , we have studied here the phenomenology of exotic @xmath0 quarks in the framework of 331-symmetric models .",

    "then we have analyzed the decays @xmath260 , considering the situation in which the previous bounds are saturated , together with some assumptions on the hierarchies in the quark mixing angles .",
    "as expected , the bounds are in agreement with family hierarchies .",
    "the dependence with the @xmath0 quark mass is shown in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "finally we have analyzed the decays of the @xmath0 quark into a scalar and an ordinary quark .",
    "though the results are strongly dependent on model parameters that are in principle unknown , it is possible to present some estimations for the widths by considering a definite scenario in which one has approximate flavor symmetries . by performing plausible assumptions on the order of magnitude of coupling constants and mass scales ,",
    "it can be seen that the decays into fermion - scalar states may be indeed the dominant ones .",
