    "the @xmath0model is widely used in the x - ray astronomy to parametrise the gas density profile in groups and clusters of galaxies fitting their surface brightness profile .",
    "cavaliere & fusco - femiano ( 1976 , 1978 ) note that  ... since both gas and galaxies distributions conforms to the same gravitational potential , the former can be _ directly _ related to the latter ; the galaxies may be considered as tracers of the total potential well ... \" : @xmath2 using the king approximation ( 1962 ) to the inner portions of an isothermal sphere ( lane - emden equation in binney & tremaine 1987 ; note that the king approximation is proportional to @xmath3 at the outer radii , whereas the isothermal sphere is proportional to @xmath4 ; cf .",
    "figure  1 ): @xmath5 and the perfect gas law , one obtains the formula : @xmath6 where the different energy distribution of the gas and galaxies is parameterized by using the parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the galaxies velocity dispersion and @xmath9 is the temperature of the gas .",
    "the surface brightness profile observed at the projected radius @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is the projection on the sky of the plasma emissivity , @xmath12 : @xmath13 ( hereafter i adopt @xmath14 as symbol for the projected radius @xmath10 ) .",
    "the emissivity is equal to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the proton density and the cooling function , @xmath17 , depends upon the mechanism of the emission and can be represented as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the velocity averaged gaunt factor that is equal to about 1.2 within an accuracy of 20% for a bolometric emissivity ( for example , at @xmath20 2.5 kev , the emission is mainly due to bremsstrahlung and the cooling function can be written with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; see , e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "assuming isothermality and a @xmath1-model for the gas density ( eq .  [ eq : rho_b ] ) , the surface brightness profile has an analytic solution : @xmath23 that is strictly valid under the condition that @xmath24 and the cooling function @xmath17 does not change radially .    in this note",
    "i will focus on energies typical for clusters of galaxies , considering the fact that there is now evidence for a decrease in the gas temperature in the outer parts of clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) . even if these results conflict with studies from other groups which indicate that clusters are generally isothermal ( e.g. irwin et al . 1999 ,",
    "kikuchi et al . 1999 , white 1999 ) , i highlight how a temperature gradient can affect the estimate of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "in the following discussion , i will assume that the cluster gas density , @xmath25 , is well described by a @xmath0 model and the gas is in the polytropic state , so that @xmath26 where the polytropic index @xmath27 ranges between 1 and 5/3 , the limits corresponding to the gas being isothermal and adiabatic , respectively .",
    ".for a given energy window @xmath28 , i calculate the slope , @xmath29 , of the power law in eqn .",
    "[ eq : cool ] over a selected temperature range @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is fixed to the value of the emissivity corresponding to the higher @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath32 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     when the cluster temperature is above the energy range of the detector with a narrow bandpass ( e.g. rosat ) , the emission measure will have a negligible dependence on the temperature ( figure  2 ) .",
    "however , this dependence becomes significant when the energy band is wide and its mean energy range is comparable to the mean temperature of the cluster . for example , the emissivity due to free - free radiation for a plasma temperature of 10 kev is 50 per cent larger than one at 4 kev in the energy range [ 1 - 10 ] kev , whereas it changes by 1 per cent in the rosat bandpass [ 0.5 - 2 ] kev . in figure  2 ,",
    "i show how the total cluster emissivity convolved with a given energy bandpass of a x - ray telescope depends upon the plasma temperature .    a proper deprojection analysis ( cf .",
    "white et al .",
    "1997 , ettori & fabian 1999 ) will be necessary to evaluate the emissivity in differential volume shells and recover both the gas density and temperature profile .",
    "on the other hand , this technique is computationally very expensive and a simple fitting procedure can be preferred in most cases where the gas and total mass distributions are investigated .",
    "as discussed above , cavaliere & fusco - femiano have introduced the @xmath0model for an isothermal gas distribution .",
    "but if , as usually done , the gas density distribution is obtained from the parameters of the best fit of eqn .",
    "[ eq : beta ] for the surface brightness profile , any temperature gradient present in the plasma will not be taken properly into account . to consider this correction",
    ", i assume that the gas density profile is well described by a @xmath0model ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : rho_b ] ) and use the temperature dependence of the emissivity ( given in eqn .",
    "[ eq : cool ] through the parameter @xmath29 ) and a polytropic relation between gas density and temperature ( represented by the index @xmath27 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : poly ] ) in the definition of the surface brightness ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : sb ] ) . then , eqn .",
    "[ eq : beta ] can be re - written as @xmath33^{0.5 -3 \\beta \\left(1 + \\alpha \\frac{\\gamma -1}{2 } \\right ) } .",
    "\\label{eq : b_poly}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 represents the uncorrected measured value .    in table  1",
    ", i calculate the @xmath29 values for a set of interesting cases .",
    "it is worth noting that , even if the observed gas temperature , @xmath9 , is the projection on the sky of the real temperature , @xmath35 ( [ eq : poly ] ) , weighted by the cluster emission , @xmath9 does not depend upon the parameter @xmath29 ( see also markevitch et al .",

    "i solve the system of equations given by the surface brightness and temperature profiles modeled with a @xmath0model : @xmath38 that can be simplified to : @xmath39 this system has the following solution : @xmath40    figure  3 shows the relative systematic corrections that affect the values of @xmath41 for a given set of ( @xmath42 ) .    in practice ,",
    "once a temperature profile is measured in a known energy bandpass , the @xmath29 parameter can be defined .",
    "the conversion from the count rate to the flux can be done assuming the central , highest temperature ( i.e. with the largest emissivity , cf .",
    "table  1 ) .",
    "the functional forms , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , can be then fitted to the surface brightness and temperature profiles , respectively .",
    "if they still represent a good model of the data , the correct @xmath41 values can be estimated : @xmath45    the consequences of these corrections are discussed below .",
    "i suggest that the @xmath0model used to fit the x - ray surface brightness profiles of clusters of galaxies has to be corrected when the data from the next generation of x - ray observatories will be available .",
    "in fact , to include any temperature gradient that will affect the cluster emissivity as observed in a large energy window , we have to extend the use of the @xmath0model to the polytropic case . the new form of this _ polytropic _ @xmath0model is given in eqn .  [ eq : b_poly ] .",
    "the spatially resolved surface brightness profiles obtained with the rosat observatory allow estimates of @xmath1 with an accuracy ( @xmath46 ) of about 2 per cent ( e.g. , mohr et al .",
    "1999 , neumann & arnaud 1999 ) .",
    "however , the limited energy band pass of rosat does not arise any problem on the application of the @xmath0model when a temperature gradient is observed in the intracluster medium .",
    "this is also true for any surface brightness profile that is obtained collecting photons within an instrumental band pass at energies lower than the mean plasma temperature .",
    "in particular , considering that the effective area of the present x - ray detectors is larger at @xmath47 kev , an energy window around these values can be a good choice for a temperature - independent emissivity for hot clusters of galaxies .",
    "but an energy range around few kev is still problematic for cool clusters and groups of galaxies that present temperature gradients .",
    "cccc @xmath14 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + & & & +   + 1 mpc & @xmath51% & @xmath52% & @xmath53% + 2 mpc & @xmath54% & @xmath52% & @xmath55% + @xmath56 & @xmath57% & @xmath58% & @xmath59% + & & & +   + 1 mpc & @xmath60% & @xmath61% & @xmath62% + 2 mpc & @xmath63% & @xmath61% & @xmath64% + @xmath56 & @xmath65% & @xmath61% & @xmath66% +    the new generation of x - ray observatories , e.g. , chandra and xmm , will operate in a wider energy band ( e.g. [ 1 - 10 ] kev ) than rosat and will provide a more accurate estimates of the parameters of the @xmath0model .",
    "therefore , as shown above , the presence of a plasma temperature gradient will affect the use of the @xmath0model with a systematic uncertainty comparable or larger than any statistical error .",
    "in particular , the estimate of ( i ) the total gravitating mass , @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "[ app : mtot ] ) , ( ii ) the gas mass , @xmath68 , and ( iii ) the consequent gas fraction , @xmath69 , can be quite significantly affected .",
    "for example , given a cluster with a typical core radius , @xmath70 , of 0.3 mpc and a radial decrease of the plasma temperature from 6 to 3 kev with uncorrected parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( e.g. markevitch et al .",
    "1999 ) , corrections of @xmath73 per cent on @xmath74 , respectively , will be necessary at @xmath75 mpc . at the more physically meaningful radius @xmath56 , where the mean cluster density is @xmath76 times the critical value ( cf .",
    "[ app : r500 ] in appendix ) , the corrections are @xmath77 per cent , respectively .",
    "these corrections increase considerably up to @xmath78 per cent at @xmath79 mpc for @xmath74 , respectively , when @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( cf .",
