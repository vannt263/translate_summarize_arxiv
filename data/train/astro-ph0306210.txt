    "the blazar tev emission reaches the earth partially absorbed by the diffuse infrared background ( dirb ) radiation which pair - produces with the tev photons @xcite .",
    "the de - absorbed spectra depend on the source redshifts and the still elusive energy distribution of the dirb .",
    "however , for all expected dirb forms , both the intrinsic peak energy @xmath5 and peak luminosity @xmath6 of the tev spectral component are higher than those observed .",
    "even for the nearby ( @xmath7 ) mkn 421 , @xmath5 can increase by a factor of @xmath0 after de - absorption to @xmath4 a few tev @xcite .",
    "the de - absorbed spectrum of h1426 + 428 at z=0.129 is even more extreme , characterized by @xmath8 tev @xcite .    the bl synchrotron spectra exhibit a break at energies @xmath9 ( primes denote energies on the flow rest frame , all energies normalized to @xmath10 ) such that the greatest fraction of the synchrotron luminosity is at energies @xmath11 .",
    "for this reason and because of the k - n decrease in the compton scattering cross section , electrons with @xmath12 will inverse compton scatter a decreasing fraction of the available photons ; as a result , the maximum ic luminosity will occur at energies @xmath13 , or @xmath14 .",
    "the values of @xmath15 observed at the lab frame are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , yielding the following relation between @xmath18 and the observed energies @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the observed synchrotron break frequency in units of @xmath22 hz , @xmath23 is the energy of the de - absorbed tev peak in units of 10 tev and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the dimensionless flow speed and @xmath26 its angle to the observer s line of sight .",
    "these values of @xmath27 are in strong conflict @xcite with the unification of bls and fr i radio galaxies @xcite , which require lorentz factors @xmath28 .",
    "additional constrains for the inner jet flow of the tev blazars come from the small , possibly sub - luminal apparent velocities observed interferometrically in the sub - pc scale jet of mkn 421 and 501 @xcite , suggestive of a decelerating flow in the inner jet of tev blazars @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above analysis and the unification of the multiwavelength spectra of the hotspots of fr ii radio galaxies and quasars in terms of decelerating relativistic flows @xcite , we propose that the same considerations are applicable in resolving the conflict of the high @xmath18 s with tev blazar unification .",
    "so , we assume that a power law electron distribution is injected at the base of a relativistic flow that decelerates while at the same time cooling radiatively .",
    "the highest frequencies of its synchrotron component originate preferentially at its fast base where the electrons are more energetic and its lorentz factor largest . as",
    "both the flow velocity and electron energy drop with radius , the locally emitted synchrotron spectrum shifts to lower energies while its beaming pattern becomes wider .",
    "the observed synchrotron spectrum is the convolution of the comoving emission from each radius weighted by the beaming amplification at each radius . at small angles",
    "the observed spectrum is harder than that observed at larger angles .",
    "this is the result of the progressively smaller @xmath29 of the flow with distance in combination with the concomitant lower electron energies due to cooling .",
    "the inverse compton emission of such a flow behaves in a more involved way : electrons will upscatter the locally produced synchrotron seed photons , giving rise to a local ssc emission with @xmath30dependence similar to to that of synchrotron . however , the electrons of a given radius scatter not only the locally produced synchrotron photons , but also those produced downstream in the flow . the energy density of the latter , will appear doppler boosted in the fast ( upstream )",
    "part of the flow by @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the relative lorentz factor between the fast and slow part of the flow . with their maximum energy being lower ( because of cooling ) and",
    "their energy density amplified they can now contribute to the ic emission at energies higher than expected on the basis of uniform velocity models ( see section 1 ) .",
    "also the @xmath30dependence of this _ upstream compton ( uc ) _ emission will be different from that of ssc and more akin to that of external compton ( ec ) @xcite .         in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 we plot the sed for a flow decelerating from @xmath33 to @xmath34 for two angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 over a distance @xmath37 cm .",
    "the radius of the cylindrical flow is set to @xmath38 cm , while the electron distribution at the base of the flow is @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the magnetic field @xmath41 g , half its equipartition value . at @xmath35",
    "this model achieves a peak energy for the high energy component at @xmath0 tev , using a modest initial lorentz factor of @xmath33 .",
    "note the strong dependence of synchrotron peak energy on @xmath26 discussed above .",
    "finally , note that , in contrast to uniform velocity homogeneous ssc models , the compton component is more sensitive to orientation than synchrotron , an indication that uc scattering dominates the @xmath4 tev observed luminosity .",
    "we now turn our attention to the problem of the unification of bls with fr i sources .",
    "a comparison of a sample of fr i nuclei to bls of similar extended radio power shows that fr i s are overluminous by a factor of @xmath42 compared to their expected luminosity @xcite , under the assumption that bls are characterized by lorentz factors @xmath43 , and that fr i s are seen under an average angle of @xmath44 .",
    "in particular the average bl to fr i nucleus luminosity ratio at radio , optical and x - ray bands was found to be : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "1 we plot as vertical bars the luminosity separation of bls and fr is according to @xcite .",
    "we also plot the sed of a decelerating flow with physical parameters similar to the one described above but with @xmath48 to produce an sed synchrotron peak similar to those of the intermediate bls that correspond in extended radio power to the fr is of @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the range of the model seds between @xmath49 ( fr i ) and @xmath50 ( bl ) reproduce well the observed range in luminosities , while a uniform velocity model of @xmath51 ( as demanded by fits of the @xmath52ray spectra ) would produce at @xmath49 an sed many orders of magnitude smaller than shown in the figure ."
