    "a major task in our microscopic study of nuclei is to describe nuclear properties with fundamental nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "first among these properties is the experimental binding energy ( of nuclear few - body or many - body systems ) .",
    "the prediction of this property remains a goal for any microscopic nuclear structure model ; it remains a severe test of the underlying dynamics .",
    "the shell - model , in addition , also aims at predicting the spectroscopic details unraveled by the experiment .",
    "the first step towards a fundamental description of the nuclear few - body or many - body systems using the nucleon degrees of freedom is the establishment of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction derived from the underlying dynamics ; this can take various forms . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", one uses the derived realistic @xmath0 potentials to directly solve faddeev equations for the eigenvalues of the nuclear few - body systems , or to determine a model - space dependent microscopic nuclear interaction for the nuclear many - body systems ( to be used in the nuclear shell - model or the bruckner hartree - fock approach ) . for nuclear many - body systems , starting from a fundamental stand point , one can take into account the strongly repulsive bare @xmath0 interaction by first selecting an effective model space and then constructing an effective hamiltonian ( nuclear @xmath1 reaction matrix ) to describe the complicated many - body bound states .",
    "effective hamiltonians can also be defined based on simple parameterization of the @xmath0 interaction , with parameters fitted to the few body systems or directly for the large systems .",
    "this alternative avoids the use of the bare @xmath0 potentials .",
    "effective hamiltonians can also be defined to account for some characteristic properties ( for instance , pairing correlation and/or symmetry issues @xcite ) of a many - body system .    at times , the effective hamiltonians are the result of global fitting @xcite ; this leads to the empirical shell - model approach .",
    "let us say at the outset that this approach has achieved a very successful unified description for most of @xmath2 shell stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "yet , the shell - model has yet to produce a deep microscopic understanding .",
    "besides , we know that the huge unfeasible shell - model spaces in the traditional large - scale shell - model calculations make it difficult to perform systematic calculations for nuclei beyond those in the @xmath3 shell ( except for some heavier nuclei near close shells ) . these nuclei often require huge scale shell - model calculations involving the best recent algorithms to deal with the large model spaces , while so many two - body matrix elements ( 195 independent 2-body matrix elements for fp - shell ) can not globally be fitted as easily as in sd - shell . beyond the @xmath3 shell , some dramatic truncation of the shell - model",
    "is required to even render the effective shell - model possible ( for instance , broken - pair shell - model @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the microscopic shell - model study with @xmath0 interactions is not only tackling a fundamental nuclear many - body problem , but it may provide helpful information for the empirical approach .    in this report , we will analyze the physics implied by different @xmath0 interactions .",
    "we will carry out simple shell - model calculations for modest valence - particles system ( more specifically , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , where exact calculations can eliminate some uncertainties , starting from various @xmath0 interactions ( i.e , using the @xmath0 interactions as input to obtain bruckner s g - matrix as microscopic effective two - body interactions ) .",
    "we argue that different @xmath0 forces can give substantial discrepancies in nuclear low - lying spectroscopy .",
    "the aim of our calculations is to provide us with some lessons of and insights about the microscopic study of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "this report is organized as follows : in sect 2 , we will briefly review some modern @xmath0 interactions and the physics they encompass .",
    "sect.3 will review the present status of the few - body and many - body calculations based on realistic @xmath0 forces . in sect .",
    "4 , attention will be paid to the nuclear many - body systems .",
    "the process to get effective interactions from @xmath0 forces is briefly mentioned . in sect . 5 , we will first mention the recently developed _",
    "drexel university shell model _ ( dusm ) algorithm and code , then describe some of the results and follow up by a brief discussion of the shell - model calculations .",
    "finally , comments will be given in sect .",
    "the description of the nucleon - nucleon interaction remains one of the most fundamental themes in low - energy hadron physics .",
    "the resulting force has important consequences for nuclear physics . with the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "one would naturally hope to derive the @xmath0 force which is based on the quark - gluon dynamics . typically , under the assumption of spontaneous breaking of dynamical symmetry and with t hooft s large @xmath7 expansion approximation , and by formally integrating out the quark and gluon fields , one can obtain an effective chiral lagrangian of low - energy hadron dynamics , namely , a `` derivation '' of skyrme - like lagrangian in the low - energy regime of qcd @xcite .",
    "recently , a derivation from the qcd lagrangian to a hadron dynamics , lagrangian , which contains qcd string structured mesons and baryons , has been achieved .",
    "based on the derived hadron dynamics lagrangian , the pseudoscalar coupling constant was theoretically estimated @xcite .",
    "such `` derivations '' provide a justification for the effective meson model of nucleon - nucleon interaction .    due to the non - perturbative nature of low - energy qcd ,",
    "the description of the @xmath0 force is carried out in practice directly via the nucleon - meson process , i.e. , using the meson degree of freedom to describe the interaction between two free nucleons . using this meson based description , the nucleon - nucleon interactions follow from three different approaches : second order perturbation theory ( e.g. , yukawa potential ) @xcite , dispersion theory ( e.g. paris potential ) @xcite , and the field - theoretical meson - exchange model for the @xmath0 interaction ( e.g. , bonn potential @xcite and nijmegen potential @xcite ) .",
    "there are also earlier and more phenomenological approaches to the nuclear potential ; in particular we quote the hard - core hamada - johnston ( hj ) potential @xcite , the reid soft - core ( rsc ) potential @xcite and the argonne @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we will come back to these later .",
    "we mention that chiral symmetry perturbation theory has recently been used to explore certain specific terms in the @xmath0 interactions ( for example , the three - nucleon force ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 force can be effectively divided into three interaction ranges : long - range one - pion - exchange part ( @xmath9 ) , intermediate - range attractive part ( @xmath10 ) and the short - range repulsive part ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this division follows naturally from the physics involved at these various distances .",
    "the long - range part presents fewer ambiguities since it is dominanted by the one - pion exchange ( ope ) effect .",
    "in fact , various realistic potential models have very similar long range part ; they differ however at shorter distances , and in particular in their intermediate - range part , which are supposedly due to the contribution from heavier mesons ( or pion resonance ) or two - pion exchanges ( tpe ) .",
    "for instance , the paris potential determines the tpe from @xmath12 and @xmath13 interactions by using dispersion relations , while the bonn potentials include both single - meson exchange ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and the tpe contributions ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 couplings ) as general meson - field description . in fig.1 , an average @xmath0 potential for @xmath20 wave",
    "is shown .",
    "= 2.50 in    the short - range repulsive terms have up to now been treated phenomenologically in all potential models . since the middle 60 s , the hard core is replaced by a soft - core .",
    "these forms are demanded to fit the experimental nucleon - nucleon phase shifts .",
    "a theoretical derivation of form factor functions for the potential near the origin would require further information on the subnucleonic structure and even explicit modelling of the quark - gluon degrees of freedom , which is beyond our current understanding of quark physics .",
    "quantitatively , the contribution of ope is about 95% of the total potential contribution for many nuclear properties , as is the case for the deuteron ; in a sense the terminology `` realistic potential '' infers the realistic treatment of ope and tpe .",
    "more specifically , in the bonn potentials , all the coupling constants are determined by fitting @xmath21 scattering data and the deuteron properties . it was claimed recently that the potential models which fit better the @xmath21 data give poorer agreement for the @xmath22 data @xcite . from deuteron properties ( i.e. , the simplest @xmath21 system ) , we already know that generally the @xmath21 components ( i.e. , mainly t=0 states ) of the nucleon - nucleon interaction are more attractive than the @xmath22 or @xmath23 ( i.e. , mainly t=0 states ) components . thus fitting only to @xmath21 scattering data will create a two - nucleon potential which could overestimate the attractive components of the @xmath0 force with respect to a unified @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 many - body system .",
    "recently , the nijmegen group are attempting to provide a potential model by fitting both the @xmath22 and @xmath21 scattering data .",
    "the work to derive an effective interaction with this interaction is still in progress .",
    "there are many available modern potentials which are based on the analysis of @xmath24 scattering data within some given energy regimes ( for example , up to 350 mev , the threshold of @xmath14 production ) and the deuteron properties .",
    "these potentials are the starting points for a microscopic study of the nuclear dynamics . to this end",
    ", the few - body system is an ideal testing - ground of the physics considered .",
    "nowadays the methods used to obtain the nuclear few - body solutions ( i.e. , in configuration - space or momentum - space ) provide very consistent and nearly exact solutions for the bound - state problem .",
    "therefore , the results of the few - body problems will more or less free one from approximations and concentrate on the study of the nucleon dynamics .",
    "solving the faddeev - noyes equations for bound states with a given nucleon - nucleon potential should provide us with the correct binding energy for such systems . hence to study",
    "three - body bound systems , such as @xmath25h and @xmath25he , are particularly important since they are the smallest ones beyond the deuteron for one to quantitatively say something about their properties and the first set of nuclei for one to investigate the importance of hree body interactions .",
    "this seemingly simple goal has been pursued by many nuclear physicists for many years , and yet to date , there is still no definitive answer ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in table 1 we have presented the benchmark results , which explicitly do not include three - body forces , of the predicted @xmath25h binding energies based upon various modern realistic potentials and as functions of the number of three - body channels . except for the bonn potential , the calculated binding energies based on the various @xmath0 potential models are about 1 mev underbound ( the experimental binding energy is 8.536 mev for @xmath25h ) . the nuclear _ rms _ charge radii computed with realistic @xmath0 potentials are consistently larger than the experimental values .",
    "this discrepancy between experiment and theory is unnerving .    one plausible explanation for the above problem is the presence of a three body force .",
    "table 1 shows that a hamiltonian of reid soft - core two - body force plus the tucson - melbourne two - pion exchange three - nucleon force ( tm3n ) @xcite can indeed provide additional binding for the trinucleon system .",
    "however , these results are highly sensitive to the @xmath14nn form factor and its cutoff mass @xmath26 @xcite . for instance , in a 34-channel calculation , the rsc+tm3n result for cutoff mass @xmath26=5.8  m@xmath27 is 8.86 ( mev ) , while the binding energies are 7.46 ( mev ) and 11.16 ( mev ) for @xmath26=4.1 and 7.1 respectively .",
    "therefore , the current status is that while the correct binding energy can be reproduced with the adjustment of the three - nucleon force , it is done so in a phenomenological manner . on a more fundamental level , three - nucleon interactions",
    "have recently been studied by the chiral invariant effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "this may be an encouraging direction to fundamentally understand and determine the effective nuclear three - body force .",
    "[ tab:1 ]    .@xmath25h binding energy ( in mev ) . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above shell - model results for the binding energies are at best confusing : when one starts from a @xmath0 soft - core potential , based on effective meson theory with coupling constants being determined by analyzing about a few thousands of @xmath0 scattering data values and the deuteron properties , the binding energy results of the microscopic shell - model calculations are overbinding . on the other hand ,",
    "starting from a @xmath0 hard - core potential , which is given perturbatively ( i.e. , the early kb effective interactions ) , the binding energy is reproduced very well .",
    "it is not only that the the binding energy is somewhat better , but the resulting spectra also demonstrate that kb s presents the best agreement compared with results from other modern potentials .",
    "we illustrate this point in fig.4 and fig.5 where we show the theoretical and experimental spectra of @xmath28o and @xmath28f .",
    "it is worth mentioning that kb not only provides the best microscopic shell model results for nuclei in @xmath29-@xmath30 shell ; recently , systematic shell - model calculations for @xmath31-@xmath32 nuclei have been carried out by using the kuo - brown interaction for the @xmath31-@xmath32 shell @xcite showing a similar trend .",
    "we may point out that a main difference between the early kb effective interactions and the more recent ones ( for example , see @xcite ) is about the treatment of the folded diagrams .",
    "for the former the folded diagrams were ignored , with the effective interaction given merely by the bare - g and the second - order core polarization diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are usually referred to as @xmath1 and @xmath33 in the literature @xcite . for the later",
    ", certain types of folded diagrams are included to all orders using a @xmath34-box formulation @xcite . what we have found in this work",
    "may indicate the need of a further investigation of the folded diagrams .",
    "there may be some other physical processes , which may counterbalance the effect of the folded diagrams and which have not been investigated .",
    "when this is done , it may be possible that the effective interaction will again be mainly given by @xmath1 and @xmath33 alone , making life simpler .",
    "in summary , we have given a brief review of the microscopic shell - model studies , and mentioned the recently developed drexel university shell model ( dusm ) code , which implements a new shell - model algorithm .",
    "we presented simple shell - model calculations to illustrate the progress made in this field and discussed some significant problems which remain in connection to the effective interactions used .",
