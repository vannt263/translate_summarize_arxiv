    "unparticle physics is an extension of the standard model , consisting in the possibility of having a non - trivial scale invariant , yet undiscovered sector of particle physics .    at first sight , unparticles appear as a generalization of neutrinos because they share the following properties : scale invariance and only very weak interaction with other fields .",
    "neutrinos enjoy the first property to a good approximation , although their oscillations disclose a small non - zero mass .",
    "the second property is a general requirement of any hypothetical particle sector because we want it to be , to a certain extent , hidden from current observations . on a closer inspection , however , we find that unparticles differ drastically from neutrinos .",
    "since we do not restrict the unparticle fields to be massless , we can no longer speak in terms of particle number as in the conventional manner .",
    "the unparticle field is controlled by a canonical scaling dimension @xmath1 which is in general a non - integer number . due to the unusual character",

    "have been explored in many areas spanning collider physics @xcite , gauge and higgs interactions @xcite , cosmology and astrophysics @xcite , ads / cft correspondence @xcite as well as gravity short scale deviations @xcite and black holes @xcite .",
    "unparticles also play a crucial role in the fractal properties of a quantum spacetime . a new fractality indicator , called un - spectral dimension ,",
    "has recently been proposed to address the case of a random - walker problem in terms of an unparticle probe @xcite .",
    "when the manifold topological dimension is @xmath5 , the un - spectral dimension turns to be @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it depends only on the scaling dimension @xmath1 .",
    "this fact explains the complete  fractalizazion   of the event horizon of un - gravity black holes @xcite , as well as of metallic plates for the casimir effect in the presence of an un - photon field @xcite .",
    "finally , unparticles have been proposed to explain some anomalies in currents flowing in super - conductors @xcite and transport phenomena in cuprates @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to address one of the basic questions of unparticle physics , _",
    "i.e. _ , the value of @xmath7 , the typical energy scale of the theory . to achieve this goal",
    ", we consider the modifications of static potentials that emerge from virtual unparticle exchange . specifically by considering the corrections to the coulomb potential we calculate the deviations of the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we show that competitive bounds on @xmath7 can be derived by a comparison with experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a short review of the basic formalism of unparticle physics ( section [ sec : unparticle ] )",
    ", we present the calculation of the energy shift by a perturbative solution of the schrdinger equation in the presence of an unparticle modified electrostatic potential ( section [ sec : hatom ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we recap the basic motivations of unparticle physics along the lines of georgi @xcite .",
    "we start by considering that at some very high energy scale , the standard model is accompanied by an additional sector of banks - zaks fields @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction between the two sectors takes place by exchange of mediating particles having a large mass scale @xmath9 .",
    "if our energy scale of interest falls below @xmath9 , we can apply effective field theory to integrate out the mediating field @xcite and get the final interaction lagrangian @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes a standard model field operator of scaling dimension @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a banks - zaks field operator of scaling dimension @xmath14 .",
    "the factor @xmath15 guarantees the dimensional consistency of , being @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the spacetime dimension .    if the energy is further decreased to a scale @xmath18",
    ", the banks - zaks fields undergo a dimensional transmutation and exhibit a scale invariant behavior with a continuous mass distribution . for energies lower than @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath19 sector becomes unparticle operators @xmath20 .",
    "the matching conditions onto the banks - zaks operators are imposed at the energy scale @xmath0 and determine the structure of the coupling between the standard model and the unparticle fields based on ( [ eq : thbackground_couplingbzsm_def ] ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the scaling dimension of the unparticle operator @xmath20 , @xmath23 denotes a dimensionless constant and @xmath2 is a dimensionless coupling parameter defined by @xmath24 the inequality holds if @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "any experimental bound on the interaction allows for constraints on the unparticle parameter space , _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the scale hierarchy is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the planck mass @xcite . in the rest of the present paper",
    "we assume @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume the customary interval @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath31 corresponds to no fractalizazion or other continuous dimension effects of unparticle physics .",
    "unparticles have been largely employed in context of static potential emerging from virtual particle exchange @xcite .",
    "such results are instrumental to the working hypothesis of the current investigation . in view of the analysis of the hydrogen atom",
    ", we consider an additional contribution to the coulomb potential for the presence of unparticle exchange in the interaction between electron and proton .     and an unparticle scalar field @xmath32 . ]    in general , we assume electrons and protons to carry unparticle charges @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . at the same time",
    ", they also possess electric charges @xmath35 allowing them to couple to the photon field @xmath36 .",
    "both interactions are independent of each other since we assume the effective couplings between unparticle stuff and photons to be negligible .",
    "therefore the interaction lagrangian can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 alternatively one can consider the vector unparticle interaction lagrangian and derive the static potential much in the same way as in the scalar case .",
    "the two results do not differ apart from a global sign ( see _ _",
    "e.g.__@xcite ) .",
    "we recall , however , that conformal invariance can be lost for vector fields if @xmath41 , although pure scale invariance can be preserved . for scalar unparticles",
    "the issue does not arise @xcite .",
    "the expression for the unparticle interaction energy @xmath42 between an electron and a proton in the static case reads @xcite : @xmath43 where the coefficient is @xmath44 and @xmath45 denotes the distance between the charges .     for different values of @xmath46 in the case @xmath47 .",

    "the hydrogen atom is a well investigated system . in the non - relativistic limit",
    "we can apply the schrdinger formalism to describe electron dynamics in a static coulomb potential of the proton , by using the particle reduced mass @xmath51 .",
    "the energy spectrum in gaussian / natural units ( @xmath52 ) reads @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "here we used the fine - structure constant @xmath55 .",
    "the biggest corrections to the schrdinger description are of order @xmath56 and arise from relativistic effects ( _ i.e. _ kinetic , spin - orbit and darwin terms ) that can be included via fine - structure modifications of the hamiltonian .",
    "there exist higher order corrections as well .",
    "the proton possesses a finite size which affects the form of the coulomb potential for distances shorter than its radius . since the proton has a spin which interacts with both the electron angular motion and the electron spin , hyperfine corrections arise .",
    "finally , one can include qed corrections such as the lamb shift . in tab .",

    "no exact solution is available in the literature but one can still rely on perturbation theory .",

    "i.e. _ , unparticle physics can lead only to subleading corrections to the standard model . as a result",
    "the energy shift of the ground state at the first order in perturbation theory reads : @xmath61 where we used @xmath62 with @xmath63  m.    for @xmath64 , the sign of @xmath65 is determined by the product of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this means that like unparticle charges lead to a shift to lower energies while unlike charges cause a shift to higher energies .",
    "the theoretical energy value @xmath68 can be divided up into the schrdinger contribution @xmath69 and higher order terms @xmath70 .",
    "the same applies to the unparticle - modified quantities . as a result",
    "we can approximate the energy shift as @xmath71 here @xmath72 stands for all the higher order contributions in the presence of unparticles , contributions we deliberately neglected in our first order description .",
    "this assumption introduces a theoretical error @xmath73 .",
    "thus the bound on the energy shift can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the experimental error . from tab . [",

    "@xmath86 is obtained by requiring that the base of the exponentiation in equal @xmath85 .",
    "the limit @xmath87 corresponds to vanishing unparticle effects since the unparticle sector in the lagrangian disappears yielding the standard electrodynamics limit @xmath88 .",
    "this explains the divergent lower bound on @xmath0 expected also in other experiments such as the electron @xmath89 anomaly @xcite or the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath90 , the scale @xmath0 is weakly constrained in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "this means that the unparticle contribution lies within @xmath91 irrespective of the value of @xmath0 .",
