    "electrons have proven to be useful probes for the study of nuclear structure , primarily because the @xmath2 interaction is reasonably well - known and because the electromagnetic interaction is weak compared to the strong forces which dominate nuclear structure . the longitudinal contribution to the nuclear response",
    "is of particular interest because of its relationship to two - body correlation functions through what is commonly known as the coulomb sum rule ( csr).@xcite with the assumption that the nucleus may be treated as a nonrelativistic system of interacting nucleons , the extraction of nucleon - nucleon correlations is formally direct : this is commonly referred to as the nonrelativistic coulomb sum rule ( nrcsr ) . in practice , however , one finds that to obtain useful information one must extend the experiments and analysis to energies and momentum transfers sufficiently large that the usual nonrelativistic assumptions fail",
    ". this will be particularly the case for experiments at the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) with @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it has become desirable to have a fully - relativistic formalism both for analyzing experimental data and for testing theoretical models of nuclear structure . in this paper , we present an extension of the nrcsr which successfully handles certain problems which arise in electron scattering from nuclei at large three - momentum transfers .    before discussing further the goals of this paper",
    ", it will be useful to review the form of the nrcsr , as well as its derivation .",
    "we begin with the first - order born ( or one - photon exchange ) approximation for the scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons ( @xmath4 ) from nuclear targets , in which one can factor the @xmath0 differential cross - section into leptonic and nuclear parts . after performing a standard separation of this nuclear response function into longitudinal and transverse ( virtual ) photon contributions , the differential cross - section in the laboratory frame can be written    @xmath5,\\label{aa}\\ ] ]    where the mott cross - section    @xmath6    describes the elastic scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons from a _ fixed _",
    "point target with charge @xmath7 and no spin . here",
    "@xmath8 is the four - momentum transfer to the target , @xmath9 is the electron scattering angle , @xmath10 is the electron beam energy and @xmath11 .",
    "the first term in the square brackets in ( [ aa ] ) is the longitudinal contribution , and is usually expressed in terms of the coulomb response function :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote initial .",
    "the results can easily be generalized to unpolarized targets with @xmath15 . ] and final nuclear states , respectively , and @xmath16 is the fourier transform of the nuclear charge density operator .    in general , the operator @xmath16 should include contributions from both the nucleons and ( virtual ) charged mesons in the target , but it has been conventional in nonrelativistic approximations to ignore the latter .",
    "then @xmath16 is given by the spatial fourier transform of the local nucleon charge density operator :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the local ( nonrelativistic ) nucleon field - operator , @xmath19 is the charge operator in isospin space which projects out protons , and @xmath20 is the proton charge form factor .",
    "( in a purely nonrelativistic treatment of the target , @xmath21 would be replaced by the fourier transform of the proton charge density @xmath22 . )",
    "charge effects of neutrons are small and are usually neglected .    to proceed to a sum rule",
    ", we first define the nonrelativistic coulomb sum function for inelastic scattering at fixed three - momentum transfer * q * :    @xmath23    where the integration is over all energies above the elastic peak at @xmath24 . expression ( [ ae ] ) then becomes a sum rule by subtracting the elastic term @xmath25 explicitly and using the closure relation    @xmath26    on the resulting sum over nuclear states @xmath14 .",
    "equation ( [ ae ] ) is then in the form of a fourier transform of the expectation value of four nucleon field operators . to separate out the two - body correlation part",
    ", we put the operators in normal order ( creation operators to the left ) by anticommutation , using    @xmath27    the sum rule then becomes    @xmath28    the first term is simply the total nuclear charge @xmath29 , and the second term can be written in terms of a correlation function :    @xmath30    and the elastic form factor of the nuclear target :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 . combining ( [ ah])([aj ] )",
    ", the nrcsr takes the compact form    @xmath33    the function @xmath34 is simply the fourier transform of the spatial two - proton correlation function .",
    "it has been defined so that @xmath35 for a system of @xmath29 uncorrelated protons .",
    "since @xmath36 is measured by elastic @xmath0 scattering , the nrcsr ( [ ak ] ) provides a direct measure of proton - proton correlations . since",
    "both @xmath36 and @xmath34 are expected to vanish in the limit of large @xmath37 , the approach of @xmath38 with increasing @xmath37 is a test of the adequacy of the theoretical assumptions .",
    "experimental studies of @xmath0 carried out in the momentum transfer region up to @xmath39 over the last decade have left serious questions about the status of the nrcsr . for light targets : @xmath40 , the measured coulomb sum @xmath41 for the largest momentum values reached.@xcite for heavier targets , however , @xmath42 by 20 - 30% compared to theoretical predictions based on independent particle models,[38 ] with larger suppressions occurring for larger nuclei .",
    "this is despite the fact that pauli correlations are expected to vanish for @xmath43 .",
    "we shall not discuss all the possible effects which could be involved here , and which have been reviewed elsewhere.@xcite however , one problem which is always present in the application of the nrcsr to data is whether the sum defined in ( [ ae ] ) is in fact saturated by the experimental data : not only is there an absolute relativistic limit @xmath44 due to the spacelike nature of virtual photons in electron scattering , but other experimental difficulties prevent one from reaching even that limit in practice .",
    "we expect that extending experiments to higher energies and momenta , such as will be done at cebaf , may improve this situation .",
    "the main problem dealt with in this paper is the extension of the coulomb sum rule to include the relativity of nucleons in inelastic scattering .",
    "this becomes unavoidable for momentum transfers @xmath45 , the nucleon mass , even if the nuclear target is essentially nonrelativistic .",
    "this follows because even if the nucleons in a typical nucleus move at essentially nonrelativistic velocities , they become highly relativistic after the absorption of a virtual photon carrying large three - momentum .",
    "thus to obtain an adequate description , one must describe nucleons with relativistic wavefunctions , e.g. , solutions to the dirac equation .",
    "this in turn introduces the difficulty of treating antinucleon degrees of freedom , which we deal with approximately .",
    "other issues also arise at higher energies , including the composite nature of nucleons themselves .",
    "this includes both nucleon electromagnetic form factors , which we include , and inelastic excitations of nucleons , which we do not .",
    "we also do not consider the effects of exchange currents among nucleons , e.g. , as carried by charged mesons .",
    "these have been studied by schiavilla _",

    "the nucleus consists of interacting relativistic nucleons , considered to be elementary particles with form factors .",
    "a number of authors have considered relativistic extensions of the nrcsr with the approximations just mentioned .",
    "walecka@xcite made the most direct extension by integrating the relativistic coulomb response function over all energies to allow the use of closure .",
    "this results in a sum rule which is nearly identical in form to the nrcsr .",
    "matsui@xcite showed , however , that such a sum rule would never be saturated by electron scattering , for which @xmath44 .",
    "he showed that , in the fermi gas model , excitations of the fermi sea ( @xmath46 scattering ) are found entirely in the spacelike response , while excitations of the dirac sea ( @xmath1 pair - production ) are found entirely in the timelike response . unlike the nrcsr , for a system of @xmath29 dirac protons the spacelike relativistic coulomb sum tends to @xmath47 in the high-@xmath37 limit as a result of this separation .",
    "this work initiated interest in spacelike coulomb sum rules based on energy transfers of @xmath44 only .",
    "several authors have studied the case of a fermi gas target.[1316 ] we will see that the exclusion of timelike contributions from the coulomb sum introduces kinematic factors related to relativistic nucleon recoil which must be accounted for in the formulation of _ sum rules _ for large @xmath37 .",
    "deforest@xcite recognized the issue of relativistic nucleon recoil and proposed a correction in the form of a modified electric form factor : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , which would be factored from the response function in the definition of the relativistic coulomb sum .",
    "he conjectured that the resulting sum rule should have an interpretation similar to the nrcsr , but did not show this .",
    "deforest s prescription has been used in the analysis of recent data.@xcite however , we will show ( in sec .",
    "5 ) that a result similar to his can be derived ( rcsr - i ) and does lead to a sum rule which bears close resemblence similar to the nrcsr , but is only accurate for dirac nucleons , i.e. , nucleons without anomalous magnetic moments . donnelly _ et al._@xcite have also proposed a modification to the definition of the spacelike coulomb sum . by requiring that their modified coulomb sum tend to @xmath29 in the large-@xmath37 limit , an integral equation for the modified form factor can be derived , then solved via an expansion in moments of the nucleon momentum . in",
    "lowest - order , this corresponds to the deforest prescription evaluated at zero nucleon momentum .",
    "however , in higher order , this method introduces an energy dependence into the coulomb sum function which then is _ not _ equivalent to a _ non - energy - weighted _ sum rule of the nrcsr form , from which correlation information can be extracted .",
    "we discuss these issues further in the concluding section .    in this paper",
    "we derive a spacelike coulomb sum rule valid for arbitrary three - momentum transfers , in which the relativity of the nucleons is taken into account .",
    "we assume that nucleons are the only degrees of freedom contributing to the spacelike sum and ignore , for example , antinucleon degrees of freedom , meson exchange currents and internal excitations of nucleons .",
    "in section 2 , we review the formalism for electron scattering from nuclear targets in the first - order born approximation , including nucleon form factors with an assumption about their off - shell continuation . in section 3",
    ", we consider elastic scattering from a single , free nucleon at rest as the simplest example of relativistic nucleon recoil effects in the constant-*q * response ; this is shown to become a large effect for @xmath45 . in section 4 , we develop our `` nucleons - only '' approximation and derive a relativistic coulomb sum rule which is exact in its treatment of nucleon recoil and fermi motion .",

    "thus it is well - known that not only form factors , but also nucleon recoil factors , modify the differential cross - section for electron scattering in the relativistic domain .",

    "the new feature in the sum rule given here is the kinematic correction for relativistic recoil , which depends on the momentum of the nucleons in the target . in the following section ,",
    "we show how this correction can be calculated in successive approximations in terms of moments of the nucleon momentum .",
    "we begin with the coulomb response function in the rest - frame of a many - body nuclear system , which is given by @xmath144 of ( [ bc ] ) , evaluated at @xmath145 :    @xmath146    where the coulomb transition matrix element is :    @xmath147    these are the relativistic equivalents of ( [ ac ] ) and ( [ ad ] ) .",

    "as discussed in section 2 , the nucleon form factors are assumed to be given by ( [ bj ] ) such that the only @xmath93 dependence in @xmath149 enters through the nucleon electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "dividing ( [ da ] ) by @xmath151 then allows us to generate a _",
    "non - energy - weighted _ sum rule , as follows .",
    "we consider the coulomb sum function defined by    @xmath152    where the integration is performed only over energies @xmath153 , corresponding to electron scattering experiments , as in ( [ ce ] ) .",

    "reduces to ( [ ce ] ) .",
    "the nucleon field operator ( [ aab ] ) , and therefore the transition matrix elements ( [ db ] ) , involve both nucleon and antinucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "however , because electron scattering experiments produce spacelike virtual photons exclusively , the resulting nuclear excitations are restricted to those whose excitation energies satisfy @xmath157 , as indicated in ( [ dd ] ) .",
    "we have already seen in ( [ ce ] ) , for the case of a free nucleon , that restricting the energy transfer @xmath93 removes the contribution of @xmath1 pair production from the coulomb sum , which would enter if @xmath158 were included in ( [ dc ] ) .",
    "similarly , for a noninteracting fermi gas , only excitations involving @xmath159 ( @xmath46 scattering ) enter into the spacelike sum .",
    "this is because there are no antinucleons present in the renormalized nuclear ground state , thus the terms involving @xmath160 ( @xmath161 scattering ) and @xmath162 ( @xmath1 pair - annihilation ) vanish identically , and because the terms involving @xmath163 ( @xmath1 pair - creation ) are restricted entirely to the timelike region , since @xmath164 .",
    "furthermore , the separation of nucleon and antinucleon degrees of freedom is complete in the fermi gas model : not only are antinucleon scattering and @xmath1 pair terms completely removed from the spacelike sum , but the @xmath114 contribution is guaranteed to lie completely in the spacelike region through the relation @xmath165 .",
    "( this feature is unaffected by the inclusion of scalar and vector potentials like those in quantum hadrodynamics , for example , as noted by do  dang _ et al._@xcite ) thus , in the fermi gas model , the spacelike nuclear response ( [ dd ] ) can be represented by effectively dropping all reference to antinucleon degrees of freedom at the level of the field operator ( [ aab ] ) .    for an interacting nuclear system , however , the separation of nucleon and antinucleon degrees of freedom is no longer exact . in general , both @xmath46 and @xmath161 degrees of freedom",
    "can contribute to the spacelike nuclear response , and some of the nucleons - only response @xmath166 , which is entirely spacelike in the fermi gas model , can be pushed into the timelike region by two - particle interactions . however",

    "the momentum distribution @xmath207 is not generally available directly from experimental data . in order to use the rcsr as given in the previous section , therefore , one would have to rely on a theoretical model to calculate the one - body term @xmath208 .",
    "an alternative approach , which we develop in this section , is to expand the one - body term ( [ dm ] ) in moments of the nucleon momentum , i.e. , in averages of powers of the nucleon momentum , weighted by the distribution @xmath209 . the one - body term ( [ dm ] ) is then replaced by a sum in terms of these moments , the first few of which may be known .",

    "this version of the sum rule requires no information about @xmath207 , and therefore has the most direct correspondence with the familiar nrcsr .",
    "although rcsr - i is surprisingly accurate ( @xmath290 ) in approximating the one - body term for a uniform system of dirac protons , it neglects the contributions from the anomalous magnetic moments , which turn out to be non - negligible ( @xmath306 for @xmath307 and @xmath245 ) .",

    "the main difference is , in the language of section 5 , his replacement of @xmath308 in ( [ ea ] ) with the lorentz invariant factor @xmath309 .",
    "however , a careful inspection of the recoil factor ( [ dn ] ) for a nucleon with arbitrary * p * shows that @xmath310 is _ not _ a lorentz scalar , and that anomalous magnetic moment effects _ must _ enter when @xmath311 . hence there is , in fact , no formal justification for writing the recoil correction at @xmath120 in scalar form .",
    "it is interesting that the factor @xmath312 is numerically nearly identical ( for all @xmath313 ) to our recoil factor @xmath314 .",
    "however , as we have seen in figure 1 , the correction due to fermi motion , which is large due to the effects of anomalous magnetic moments , must be included for a reliable evaluation of the one - body term .",
    "for example , for @xmath315 , the factor given by deforest",
    "_ underestimates _ relativistic recoil corrections by @xmath316 , compared to rcsr - ii ; therefore , division of the experimental data ( as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example ) by deforest s factor in the calculation of the experimental coulomb sum will lead to an _ overenhancement _ of the sum by @xmath317 .",
    "the goal of donnelly _",
    "et al._@xcite is somewhat different : to find a factor @xmath318 which would replace @xmath319 in the definition of the spacelike coulomb sum function , such that the sum will reach @xmath29 in the high-@xmath37 limit .",
    "although their approach can , in principle , achieve that goal to essentially any order of accuracy , it necessarily leads to a correction factor @xmath318 which depends explicitly on the excitation energy @xmath93 . however , unless the @xmath93-dependence can be extracted from the coulomb response function _ before",
    "_ integration over @xmath93 , one will not arrive at a _ non - energy - weighted _ sum rule .",
    "in particular , the approach taken by donnelly _",
    "_ will necessarily involve energy - weighted sum rules , which differ formally from the nrcsr , and the rcsr we have derived , in that dynamical information becomes mixed with the correlation information .",
    "a crucial step in the derivation of our sum rule is the extraction of the energy dependence from the response function _ before _",
    "integration over @xmath93 . to do this , we needed two assumptions : first , that the off - shell form factors could be obtained from the on - shell form factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 as in ( [ bj ] ) .",
    "although plausible , this requires theoretical justification , i.e. , a theory of the electromagnetic structure of nucleons .",
    "the second assumption is that the form factors are all proportional , as in ( [ bk])([bn ] ) .",
    "this is probably sufficiently accurate , except possibly for taking @xmath204 , as noted earlier .",
    "a better approximation would be to take @xmath320 , using data from larger @xmath87 , although this is incorrect near @xmath321 .",
    "the results of this work do have some bearing on the question of the saturation of the nrcsr , which we mentioned in section  1 .",
    "the coulomb sum function usually extracted from @xmath0 experiments is that of ( [ ae ] ) , but with a finite upper limit on @xmath93 ; since the theoretical limit at fixed @xmath37 is @xmath44 , this is essentially identical to ( [ dc ] ) . for the relativistic sum rules given in section 5",
    ", one must divide the sum by the relativistic recoil factor @xmath322 , i.e. , either @xmath238 or @xmath239 , to obtain a form which should `` saturate '' at @xmath29 in the limit that @xmath136 .",
    "since @xmath323 , this correction will _ enhance _ the experimental sum , e.g. , as was shown in figures 24 . at the energies of interest ,",
    "however , this is only a small effect , e.g. , at @xmath324 we have @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these factors grow with increasing @xmath327 , and therefore do show _ in part _ the increased suppression seen in larger nuclei .",
    "of course , many other effects may also contribute to the observed suppression .",
    "although we have worked within a `` nucleons - only '' approximation , in principle , @xmath328 processes are easily included in this formalism ( since the matrix element of @xmath70 between @xmath161 states is the same as that between @xmath46 states ) .",
    "however , we do not pursue this here because other @xmath161 contributions , e.g. , @xmath1 pair production , which may also enter the spacelike response , are likely to be of the same order . in order to understand fully the contribution of antinucleons to electron scattering",
    ", it will be necessary to study the spacelike response function in interacting nuclear models , and devise an appropriate renormalization scheme to obtain finite results .",
    "two issues which are not treated in this paper must also be addressed if the relativistic coulomb sum rule given here is to be used for the extraction of nucleon - nucleon correlation information : namely , the contribution of meson exchange currents , and internal excitations of the nucleon .",
    "the first can be thought of as generating two - body ( or more ) terms in the nuclear current operator @xmath67 in ( [ bf ] ) , as done , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , where meson current contributions are actually calculated in a model . from the point of view of the sum rule , these many - body contributions can be grouped with the two - body term @xmath329 of ( [ do ] ) , to be determined _ experimentally _ as what is left over when @xmath214 is subtracted from the coulomb sum .",
    "the second issue can be thought of , to a first approximation , as the problem of removing the `` background '' of @xmath330 excitations from the @xmath0 response , to leave the `` nucleons - only '' response , to which our relativistic coulomb sum rules apply .",
    "this could be done theoretically by calculating the @xmath331 background , e.g. , in a noninteracting - nucleus model .",
    "alternatively , some partially exclusive experimental information could help : for example , @xmath332 data in the quasi - free peak region can be used to normalize the knockout of protons ( as opposed to @xmath331 ) , although other process ( e.g. , @xmath333 ) will also contribute to this process .",
    "these two problems , and the problem of antinucleons , are subjects for future investigation .    0.2 true in * acknowledgements * 0.2 true in    this research was supported in part by the u.  s.  department of energy under grant no .",
    "de - fg02 - 88er40425 with the university of rochester .",
    "we would also like to thank the high energy physics group for the use of their vax computer .",
    "the dirac equation for free point nucleons represented by the wavefunction @xmath334 can be written    @xmath335    where @xmath336 . for a static , spatially uniform system , the solutions to ( [ aaa ] )",
    "can be expressed as momentum eigenstates with momentum * p*. the energy eigenvalues for positive and negative energy solutions are @xmath337 , where @xmath338 .    from the complete set of solutions to ( [ aaa ] ) , it is possible to construct a local field operator in terms of nucleon and antinucleon degrees of freedom :    @xmath339,\\label{aab}\\ ] ]    where @xmath340 represents the normalization volume .",
    "the nucleon and antinucleon spinors are defined    @xmath341\\qquad      v_s({\\bf p})=\\sqrt{e_{\\bf p}+m }      \\biggl[{{{\\bf \\sigma\\cdot p}\\over      e_{\\bf p}+m}\\chi_s\\atop\\chi_s}\\biggr ]      \\label{aac}\\ ] ]    respectively , and have been normalized to @xmath342 particles per unit volume . here",
    "@xmath343 is the usual two - dimensional pauli spinor , and @xmath344 and @xmath345 are destruction and creation operators for nucleon and antinucleons , respectively .",
    "it is possible to generalize this formalism to include isospin degrees of freedom .",
