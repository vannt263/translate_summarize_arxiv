    "detailed and reliable online traffic state estimation is a prerequisite for advanced traffic information systems and the next generation of driver assistance systems  @xcite .",
    "recent advances in wireless and sensor technologies have therefore promoted new potentials for a vehicle - infrastructure integration ( vii ) system which allows for a wireless communication between roadside sensors and vehicles equipped with communication interfaces  @xcite .",
    "data gathered from equipped vehicles ( ` probe vehicles ' or ` floating cars ' ) can be used to assess and predict traffic conditions and , in turn , information about incidents , travel times or congestion can be communicated from roadside units to the vehicles  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the following setup for an online traffic - surveillance application based on floating car data : probe vehicles collect their positions and speeds over time and communicate this information to roadside units either periodically by instantaneous forwarding by mobile phone communication , or , alternatively , by short - range communication when passing the location of a roadside unit . in any case , the roadside units are connected to each other and collect the data periodically for an online traffic state estimation .",
    "more specifically , we consider the prediction of the upstream jam front which , for example , can be used to warn the driver when congestion is ahead . for this purpose , we study the data collection , the communication to roadside units , and the traffic state estimation ` in - the - loop ' by means of microscopic traffic simulations as a function of the percentage of equipped vehicles .",
    "this approach enables us to compare the estimates of both communication modes to the  known and reproducible  traffic situation .",
    "since the expected equipment levels in the first deployment phase will be small , we consider small percentages of probe vehicles below only .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : simsetup ] , the microscopic simulation set - up is described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimation ] , the algorithm for the estimation of jam fronts is presented and a measure for evaluating the estimation quality is defined . in sec .  [",
    "sec : calcvg ] an alternative model - based approach is presented which uses additionally flow measurements from stationary detector .",
    "we close with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : diss ] .",
    "for the following case study of online estimation of jam fronts one needs a suited and realistic traffic situation serving as reference scenario . for this purpose",
    "we start with the empirical traffic jam observed on the german freeway a5 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trafficsituation](left ) . in the simulation environment",
    ", we consider a road - section with three lanes and a flow - conserving bottleneck  @xcite . the empirical traffic flows and truck percentages from one detector location ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundarycond ] ) serve as upstream boundary conditions assuring realistic traffic volumes and degrees of traffic heterogeneity .",
    "the simulator uses the _ intelligent driver model _",
    "@xcite as a simple , yet realistic , car - following model , and the general - purpose lane - changing algorithm mobil  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the car - following model ( see table  [ tab : idm ] ) and the bottleneck strength ( modeled by a local increase of the time gap parameter @xmath0 by in a given time interval ) have been adapted in order to reproduce the empirically observed spatiotemporal congestion pattern on a semi - quantitative level .",
    "figure  [ fig : trafficsituation](right ) shows the simulation result .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "car - to - infrastructure communication offers interesting potentials for driver information services which are more detailed and more up - to - date than today s tmc messages and/or digital maps .",
    "for instance , infrastructure - related messages , e.g. , about a temporary workzone , can be transmitted by a road - side unit ( rsu ) via local wireless communication devices . however , reliable information about the _ dynamic _",
    "traffic situation requires up - to - date traffic data and robust prediction models . in this paper , we have considered a vehicle - based approach to collect traffic data and use the data to estimate the upstream and downstream fronts of a traffic jam .",
    "a small percentage of probe vehicles records their trajectories and speeds to transmit the data to a rsu .",
    "we have shown that the delays resulting from a local communication to a single rsu positioned downstream the bottleneck will prevent a reliable jam front estimation based on floating - car data only .",
    "obviously , the delay time can be reduced by using more road - side units along the roadway so that probe vehicles can transmit their data in shorter intervals .",
    "furthermore , we considered an alternative prediction approach using floating car data in combination with flow data collected by stationary detectors , which allows to apply the propagation equation of shock waves .",
    "since probe vehicle data can be used for an automatic correction of the estimates and for an online calibration of the model parameters , this is a robust and promising concept which is effective already for equipment percentages of probe vehicles of a few per mill .",
    "moreover , it is suited for a real - time application in practice .",
    "travel times and time losses due to congestion are also relevant dynamic quantities for local driver information services .",
    "travel times can directly be derived from the probe vehicle data .",
    "however , this estimation does not allow to _ predict _ travel times which becomes relevant when no probe vehicle passes the rsu for a while .",
    "alternatively , travel times can be calculated in a more robust way from cumulative vehicles counts .",
    "again , probe vehicles can be used to reset the accumulated counting errors .",
