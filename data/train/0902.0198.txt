    "when queried about a subset @xmath20 a _ matroid oracle _ returns in unit time some information about @xmath21 .",

    "these two oracles are known as the _ rank _ and _ independence oracles _ respectively .",
    "an oracle algorithm is _ efficient _ if the number of calls it makes to the oracle is bounded by some fixed polynomial function of @xmath22 , for any matroid @xmath6 , and all additional computation can also be done in polynomial time .",
    "it is easy to see that there is an efficient procedure for simulating a rank oracle using an independence oracle , and vice versa .",
    "that being the case , we will assume that any mention of an oracle refers to one of these models , without specifying which .",
    "using theorem  [ thm14 ] , and techniques invented by truemper  @xcite , it is possible to construct an efficient oracle algorithm for deciding whether a matroid is regular ( see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast to this , the algorithms of theorem  [ thm17 ] do not extend to efficient oracle algorithms , as we now discuss .",
    "an example of seymour s  @xcite shows that there is no efficient oracle algorithm for deciding whether a matroid is binary .",

    "thus we can expect no oracle analogue of theorem  [ thm17 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the characterizations of section  [ classes ] feature basic classes that are recognizable by efficient oracle algorithms .",
    "this reveals the curious fact that it is possible to have an efficient algorithm for deciding membership in a class of matroids when the input is guaranteed to be internally @xmath0-connected , even if there is no efficient algorithm for deciding membership in the general case ( see propositions  [ prop36 ] and  [ prop37 ] ) .",

    "if @xmath6 is a matroid then its characteristic polynomial , @xmath30 is a polynomial in the variable @xmath31 . if @xmath6 is loopless and representable over @xmath32 then the `` critical exponent '' of @xmath6 over @xmath33 , denoted @xmath34 , is the smallest positive integer @xmath35 such that @xmath36 . in section",
    "[ critical ] we show that any loopless binary matroid with no @xmath1-minor has a critical exponent over @xmath5 of at most four .",

    "we briefly discuss some of the techniques used in the article , on the grounds that they may be of use in other applications .",
    "the algorithm that we develop to decide whether a represented binary matroid has a particular minor is very similar to that used to decide if @xmath14 $ ] is regular ( here @xmath13 is a matrix over @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , the situation is complicated by the fact that the @xmath17-sum of two binary matroids can have an @xmath1-minor ( for example ) , even if the two terms of the sum do not .",
    "we overcome this obstacle by developing a more sophisticated technique for decomposing binary matroids into internally @xmath0-connected  components .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is a matrix over @xmath5 and that @xmath14 $ ] is a @xmath17-connected matroid . in section  [ binary ]",
    "we describe a polynomial - time algorithm which , given @xmath13 , computes a rooted binary tree , called a `` decomposition tree '' of @xmath14 $ ] , each node of which is labeled with a binary matroid @xmath39 and a collection @xmath40 of pairwise disjoint triangles of @xmath39 .",
    "the essential idea is that if a node is labeled by the matroid @xmath39 , and @xmath39 can be expressed as a @xmath17-sum , then the two children of that node are labeled with the terms of the @xmath17-sum .",
    "however , we would like each triangle in @xmath40 to be completely contained in one of the two terms .",
    "this means that if a triangle in @xmath40 contains a point that could be assigned to either term of the @xmath17-sum , then that point needs to be duplicated with a parallel point .",
    "leaves of the decomposition tree are labeled with matroids that are internally @xmath0-connected  ( up to parallel pairs ) .",
    "if @xmath6 is a binary matroid and @xmath41 is a collection of pairwise disjoint triangles of @xmath6 then we let @xmath42 be the matroid produced by performing @xmath43  operations on each of the triangles in @xmath41 .",
    "the algorithms of theorem  [ thm17 ] depend upon the following lemma , which follows easily from the results in section  [ binary ] .",
    "[ thm18 ] suppose that @xmath8 is a collection of internally @xmath0-connectedbinary matroids such that each matroid in @xmath8 has at least four elements , and no matroid in @xmath8 contains both a triangle and a triad .",

    "suppose that @xmath6 is a @xmath17-connected binary matroid and that there is a decomposition tree of @xmath6 , the leaves of which are labeled @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath6 has a minor in @xmath8 if and only if :    a.   there is a leaf @xmath46 such that @xmath39 has a minor in @xmath8 ; or , b.   there is a leaf @xmath46 such that @xmath47 has a minor in @xmath44 .",
    "( indeed lemma  [ thm18 ] is true even if we replace @xmath8 in statement  ( i ) of the lemma with @xmath48 . )",
    "thus the problem of deciding whether @xmath14 $ ] has a minor in @xmath8 is reduced to that of deciding whether an internally @xmath0-connected  binary matroid has a minor in @xmath8 , and then deciding when performing a sequence of @xmath43  operations will produce a minor in @xmath44 .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] involves a considerable amount of computer checking . in this paper",
    "we also use a computer to check a handful of statements . for this purpose",
    "we use macek , the software package developed by petr hlinn .",
    "macek is freely available to download , along with supporting documentation , at the current website http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hlineny/macek . in section  [ checking ]",
    "we provide a list of all the computer checks needed in this article .",
    "in this section we speculate on the extent to which the algorithmic results of section  [ algorithms ] are special cases of more general theorems .",
    "while this paper focuses on binary matroids , the conjectures are also interesting for other fields and we state some of them at that level of generality .",
    "the first two conjectures are originally due to neil robertson and paul seymour , although apparently they never stated them in print .",
