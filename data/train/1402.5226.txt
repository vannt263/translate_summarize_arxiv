    "this results from formula ( [ exlap ] ) in the case ( @xmath147 ) and the formula of @xmath155 case .",

    "therefore , protons are accelerated forward in the laser propagation direction . when the electron density of the hydrogen layer is negligibly small compared with the high-@xmath5 atom layer , the origin is considered to be the front side surface of the high-@xmath5 atom layer . since",

    "w/@xmath3 which is not enough for rpda . other acceleration schemes after it , the coulomb explosion of each ion cloud and coulomb repulsion between each cloud , generate a high energy and quasi - monoenergetic proton beam .    in a polyethylene ( ch@xmath4 ) target , a proton layer and a carbon ion layer are formed . in this separated situation ,",
    "a strong coulomb explosion of each layer and coulomb repulsion between each layer generate the high energy protons .",

    "the thickness of the target in our simulations corresponded to 0.1@xmath20 m with ordinary solid polyethylene and carbon which has the same value of @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the mass density .",
