    "for theories of interacting gauge and higgs fields with spontaneously broken gauge symmetry two well known gauges are the unitary gauge ( u - gauge ) @xcite and the renormalizable r@xmath1-gauge @xcite . in the u - gauge the gauge - variant transversal part of the higgs field",
    "has been eliminated and the lagrangian only contains physical degrees of freedom .",
    "although the feynman rules in the u - gauge are simpler , it is usually not used for perturbative calculations .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that for large momenta the gauge field propagator grows faster than in the r@xmath1-gauge .",
    "consequently the model in the u - gauge appears to be unrenormalizable by the usual power - counting rules . in the r@xmath1-gauge ,",
    "on the other hand , more fields have to be taken into account , namely the unphysical components of the higgs field and the ghost field .",
    "the feynman rules are more complicated and there are more diagrams to be calculated .",
    "the advantage is that the model in the r@xmath1-gauge is manifestly renormalizable .",
    "with the help of slavnov - taylor identities it can formally be shown that renormalized on - shell quantities are independent of the gauge @xcite .",
    "such physical quantities should therefore in principle be calculable in the u - gauge .",
    "it appears , however , that the cancellation of divergent terms is a delicate matter . in practice ,",
    "calculations in the unitary gauge have sometimes led to results , which are in conflict with those obtained in other gauges @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the possibility of doing perturbation theory in the u - gauge and the relation between the r@xmath1-gauge and the u - gauge . for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the two - dimensional abelian higgs model .",
    "it contains all the features we would like to discuss , but the explicit calculations are easier than in non - abelian models in 4 dimensions .",
    "we perform the perturbative calculations of off - shell quantities on the one - loop level .",
    "ultraviolet divergencies are treated by means of dimensional regularization , where the number of dimensions of space - time are taken to be @xmath3 .",
    "formally , the u - gauge is obtained by taking the limit @xmath2 of the r@xmath1-gauge . applying this prescription naively",
    ", results are obtained , which do not coincide with those of the u - gauge .",
    "we discuss the origin of this discrepancy , which is related to the fact that the limits @xmath4 and @xmath2 are not interchangeable , and discuss how to go from the r@xmath1-gauge to the u - gauge properly .",
    "we would like to point out that renormalization of the 4-dimensional abelian higgs model in the unitary gauge has been discussed by sonoda @xcite with the help of suitable choice of interpolating fields .",
    "the model contains a real vector field @xmath5 and a complex scalar higgs field @xmath6 .",
    "we shall consider the theory in a two - dimensional space - time with a euclidean metric .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are coupling constants .",
    "the potential is of the mexican hat type with its minima at @xmath13 the lagrangian is invariant under local gauge transformations @xmath14      the scalar field can be written in the form @xmath15 with real @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the u - gauge is obtained by choosing the gauge transformation function as @xmath18 .",
    "the transformed fields are then @xmath19 they represent the gauge invariant physical degrees of freedom . in terms of @xmath16",
    "the potential can be expressed as @xmath20 after expanding the scalar field around the minimum of the potential as @xmath21 the lagrangian reads , up to an irrelevant constant , @xmath22 one can read off that the higgs scalar @xmath23 has mass @xmath24 and the vector field @xmath25 is massive with mass @xmath26 . from the lagrangian the following feynman rules are obtained .",

    "but it is safer to keep this term for the moment . with the help of ghost fields",
    "we can write @xmath43 with @xmath44 the prefactor @xmath45 has been chosen such that comparison with similar terms in the r@xmath1-gauge is facilitated .",
    "the lagrangian gets the additional ghost terms @xmath46 and the feynman rules are augmented by    * ghost propagator : @xmath47 * ghost-@xmath23-vertex : @xmath48    in the one - loop order the green s functions of the scalar and vector fields get additional contributions from ghost loops .",
    "these are proportional to @xmath49 in dimensional regularization these contributions vanish due to the rule @xcite @xmath50 this justifies one neglecting the measure factor @xmath42 .",
    "the ghost fields introduced above are , however , useful in the discussion of the relation between the u - gauge and the r@xmath1-gauge .      in the r@xmath1-gauge the higgs field is decomposed into its real and imaginary parts as @xmath51 expanding the lagrangian in terms of these fields , a mixing term between @xmath5 and @xmath52 appears on the quadratic level .",
