    "complex networks are widely studied across many fields of science and technology , from physics to biology , and from nature to society .",
    "networks which have similar global topological features such as degree distribution and graph diameter can exhibit significant differences in their local structures .",
    "there is a growing interest to explore these local structures ( also known as `` _ motifs _ '' ) , which are small connected subgraph patterns that form during the growth of a network .",
    "motifs have many applications , for example , they are used to characterize communication and evolution patterns in online social networks ( osns )  @xcite , pattern recognition in gene expression profiling  @xcite , protein - protein interaction prediction  @xcite , and coarse - grained topology generation of networks  @xcite .",
    "for instance , 3-node motifs such as `` _ the friend of my friend is my friend _ '' and `` _ the enemy of my enemy is my friend _ ''",
    "are well known evolution patterns in signed ( i.e. , friend / foe ) social networks .",
    "kunegis et al .",
    "@xcite considered the significance of motifs in slashdot zoo and how they impact the stability of signed networks .",
    "other more complex examples include 4-node motifs such as bi - fans and bi - parallels defined in  @xcite .",
    "although motifs are important characteristics to help researchers to understand the underlying network , one major technical hurdle is that it is computationally expensive to compute motif frequencies since this requires one to enumerate and count all subgraphs in a network , and there exist a large number of subgraphs even for a medium size network with less than one million edges .",
    "for example , the graphs slashdot  @xcite and epinions  @xcite , which contain approximately @xmath0 nodes and @xmath1 edges have more than @xmath2 4-node connected and induced subgraphs  @xcite . to address this problem ,",
    "several sampling methods have been proposed to estimate the frequency distribution of motifs  @xcite .",
    "all these methods require that the entire graph topology fit into memory , or the existence of an i / o efficient neighbor query api available so that one can explore the graph topology , which is stored on disk . in summary ,",
    "previous work focuses on designing * _ computationally efficient _ * methods to characterize motifs when the * _ entire graph _ * of interest is given .     and the underlying graph @xmath3.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in practice the graph of interest may not be known , but instead the available dataset is a subgraph sampled from the original graph",
    ". this can be due to the following reasons :    * * data collection * : sampling is inevitable for collecting a large dynamic graph given as a high speed stream of edges .",
    "for example , sampling is used to collect network traffic on backbone routers in order to study the network graph where a node in the graph represents a host and an edge @xmath4 represents a connection from host @xmath5 to host @xmath6 , because capturing the entire traffic is prohibited due to the high speed traffic and limited resources ( e.g. memory and computation ) of network devices . *",
    "* data transportation * : sampling may also be required to reduce the high cost of transporting an entire dataset to a remote data analysis center . *",
    "* memory and computation * : sometimes the graph of interest is given in a memory expensive format such as a raw text file , and may be too large to fit into memory . moreover , it may be too expensive to preprocess and organize it on disk . in such cases , it may be useful to build a relatively small graph consisting of edges sampled from the graph file at random , and compute its motif statistics in memory .",
    "a simple example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : examplegstar ] , where the sampled graph @xmath7 is derived from the dataset representing @xmath3 . in this work",
    ", we assume the available graph @xmath7 is obtained through random edge sampling ( i.e , each edge is independently sampled with the same probability @xmath8 ) , which is popular and easy to implement in practice .",
    "formally , we denote the graph @xmath7 as a resampled graph of @xmath3 .",
    "one can easily see that a resampled graph s motif statistics will differ from those of the original graph due to uncertainties introduced by sampling .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : biasexample ] shows that @xmath9 is a 4-node induced subgraph in the resampled graph @xmath7 , and we do not know from which original induced subgraph @xmath10 in @xmath3 that it derives .",
    "@xmath10 could be any one of the five subgraphs depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : biasexample ] .     is a 4-node induced subgraph in the resampled graph @xmath7 , and @xmath10 is the original induced subgraph of @xmath9 in the original graph @xmath3.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]        unlike previous methods  @xcite , we aim to design an * _ accurate method _ * to infer motif statistics of the original graph @xmath3 from the available resampled graph @xmath7 .",
    "these previous methods focus on designing computationally efficient sampling methods based on sampling _ induced _ subgraphs in @xmath3 to avoid the problem shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : biasexample ] .",
    "hence they fail to infer the underlying graph s motif statistics from the given resampled graph .",
    "the gsh method in  @xcite can be used to estimate the number of connected subgraphs from sampled edges .",
    "however it can not be applied to characterize motifs , i.e. , connected and * _ induced _ * subgraphs ( or cises ) , because motif statistics can differ from connected subgraphs statistics .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : inducdvsnoninduced ] shows that @xmath11 of a graph s 4-node connected subgraphs are isomorphic to a 4-node line ( i.e. , the _ first _ motif in fig .  [ fig:345nodeclasses ] ( b ) ) , while @xmath12 of its 4-node cises are isomorphic to a 4-node line .",
    "* contribution : * our contribution can be summarized as : to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to study and provide an accurate and efficient solution to estimate motif statistics from a given resampled graph . we introduce a probabilistic model to study the relationship between motifs in the resampled graph and in the underlying graph .",
    "based on this model , we propose an accurate method , minfer , to infer the underlying graph s motif statistics from the resampled graph .",
    "we also provide a fisher information based method to bound the error of our estimates .",
    "experiments on a variety of real world datasets show that our method can accurately estimate the motif statistics of a graph based on a small resampled graph .",

    "we evaluate the performance of our methods on publicly available datasets taken from the stanford network analysis platform ( snap ) , which are summarized in table  [ tab : datasets ] .",
    "we start by evaluating the performance of our methods in characterizing @xmath14-node cises over million - node graphs : flickr , pokec , livejournal , youtube , web - google , and wiki - talk , contrasting our results with the ground truth computed through an exhaustive method .",
    "it is computationally intensive to calculate the ground - truth of @xmath15-node and @xmath16-nodes cis classes in large graphs .",
    "for example , we can easily observe that a node with degree @xmath17 is included in at least @xmath18 4-node cises and @xmath19 5-node cises , therefore it requires more than @xmath20 and @xmath21 operations to enumerate the 4-node and 5-node cises of the wiki - talk graph , which has a node with 100,029 neighbors . even for a relatively small graph such as soc - slashdot08 , it takes almost 20 hours to compute all of its 4-node cises . to solve this problem ,",
    "the experiments for 4-node cises are performed on four medium - sized graphs soc - epinions1 , soc - slashdot08 , soc - slashdot09 , com - dblp , and com - amazon , and the experiments for 5-node cises are performed on four relatively small graphs ca - gr - qc , ca - hep - th , ca - condmat , and p2p - gnutella08 , where computing the ground - truth is feasible . we also evaluate the performance of our methods for characterizing signed cis classes in graphs sign - epinions , sign - slashdot08 , and sign - slashdot09 .      in our experiments , we focus on the normalized root mean square error ( nrmse ) to measure the relative error of the estimator @xmath22 of the subgraph class concentration @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is defined as the mean square error ( mse ) of an estimate @xmath28 with respect to its true value @xmath29 , that is @xmath30=\\text{var}(\\hat{\\omega})+\\left(\\mathbb{e}[\\hat{\\omega}]-\\omega\\right)^2.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath31 decomposes into a sum of the variance and bias of the estimator @xmath28 .",
    "both quantities are important and need to be as small as possible to achieve good estimation performance .",
    "when @xmath28 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath32 , then we have @xmath33 and thus @xmath25 is equivalent to the normalized standard error of @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
