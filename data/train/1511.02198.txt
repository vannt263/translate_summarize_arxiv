    "an entanglement state usually refers to the quantum state of a composite system which can not be expressed as the direct product of the quantum states of its subsystems.@xcite in the entanglement state , a measurement on one of the particles will immediately change the state of other particles @xcite via the `` spooky action at a distance '' @xcite no matter how far these particles are spatially separated .",
    "the entanglement state is important for both fundamental research @xcite and applications in quantum information @xcite .",
    "a considerable amount of theoretical and technical works have been devoted to the entanglement of one degree of freedom @xcite and several degrees of freedom , i.e. , hyperentanglement @xcite or multimode entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , one may ask whether the particles can form a special entanglement state that can package in all their physical properties capable of completely identifying the particles ? from particle physics , we know that a particle possesses a number of independent physical quantities ( or freedoms ) , such as charge , baryon number , lepton number etc.@xcite the question is whether all these physical quantities could be packaged as an entirety in the new entanglement state . we shall call such an entanglement state as `` packaged entanglement state '' , which is different to the hyperentanglement @xcite or multimode entanglement @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the packaged entanglement states could be used to teleport the entire particles and systems instead of just some of their physical properties as described before .",
    "this feature may enable matter teleportation in which every intrinsic property of the particles needs to be transmitted for the purpose of rematerialization.@xcite    in this work we studied the properties of the packaged entanglement states and their important applications .",
    "we first constructed the mathematical expression for the packaged entanglement states using the charge conjugation operator and discussed their physical properties in detail .",
    "next , we proposed a possible experimental method for testing whether the particle - antiparticle pairs are in the packaged entanglement states .",
    "thirdly , we discussed how to teleport a particle to a place at a distance using the packaged entanglement states and how to transfer a packaged entanglement state from two particles to another two particles .",
    "we also present a new interpretation to the baryogenesis based on the theory of packaged entanglement states in which the particles are indeterminate and hermaphroditic .",
    "finally , we discussed the possible applications of the particle teleportation process in medicine , remote control , and targeted energy transfer .",
    "for simplicity , let us first choose a particle - antiparticle pair ( with a zero total charge ) to carry out the study . we need to proof the existence of the packaged entanglement states through logical reasoning .",
    "we also need to construct the mathematical expression of the packaged entanglement states and therefore study their properties .",
    "this can be achieved by referring to charge conjugation .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the particle s quantum state and @xmath2 denote the antiparticle s quantum state .",
    "it is known that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are symmetrical in the sense of charge , i.e. , the charge of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are equal in quantity but with opposite signs .",
    "for this reason , we shall call the charge as the particle s gender . from particle physics @xcite",
    "we know that @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be interchanged by the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this mutual transformation indicates that @xmath3 and @xmath4 could be mixed together in the sense of wave function under certain conditions .",
    "although the name `` charge conjugation '' is used , it not only reverses the sign of the particle s electric charge ( @xmath8 ) , but also reverses the sign of all other internal quantum numbers @xcite , i.e. , baryon number ( @xmath9 ) , lepton number ( @xmath10 ) , isospin ( @xmath11 ) , charm ( @xmath5 ) , strangeness ( @xmath12 ) , topness ( @xmath13 ) , and bottomness ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "all these internal quantum numbers are packaged together under the charge conjugation .",
    "it should be also mentioned that @xcite the charge conjugation does not change the sign of mass , energy , momentum , and spin .",
    "it is known that not all particle ( antiparticle ) states , but only those neutral systems ( with zero total charge ) are the eigenstates of the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 , such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and a `` particle - antiparticle '' pair etc .",
    "it can be shown that @xcite , applying @xmath5 to the bound state of a `` particle - antiparticle '' pair @xmath17 , one has @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total angular momentum quantum number , @xmath10 is the orbital angular momentum quantum number , and @xmath12 is the total spin quantum number . for bosons @xmath20 , @xmath12 is an even number and eq.([eigenstate ] ) reduces to @xmath21 .",
    "similar to eq.([eigenstate ] ) , one can also show that the reversed configuration @xmath22 is an eigenstate of @xmath5 .",
    "mathematically , the linear combination ( superposition ) of @xmath17 and @xmath22 are also the eigenstates of @xmath5 . for a `` particle - antiparticle '' pair @xmath23 and @xmath9 ,",
    "therefore , one can construct the following four eigenstates of @xmath5 , i.e. ,    @xmath24    on the other hand , one can easily show that @xcite @xmath25 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 is a hermitian operator and is therefore an observable physical quantity . as the eigenstates of @xmath5 ,",
    "therefore , @xmath26 and @xmath27 must exist .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath26 are separable states .",
    "a fundamental character of these states is that each of their particles is determinate , i.e. , it is either a particle or an antiparticle . in other words ,",
    "the gender of particles in @xmath26 are fixed .",
    "but the eigenstates @xmath27 are entanglement states because they can not be expressed as the direct product of the particle state and antiparticle state.@xcite a fundamental character of these states is that each of their particles is indeterminate , i.e. , it is partially a particle and partially an antiparticle . in other words ,",
    "the particles in @xmath27 are hermaphrodites .",
    "therefore , one can not tell which one is a particle and which one is an antiparticle . when performing a measurement on @xmath23",
    ", it will collapse into either a particle , or an antiparticle .",
    "if @xmath23 collapse into a particle , then @xmath9 will collapse into an antiparticle .",
    "if @xmath23 collapse into an antiparticle , then @xmath9 will collapse into a particle .    as mentioned before , the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 packages in a number of quantum numbers ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "all these quantum numbers should entangle together in the packaged entanglement states @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , @xmath27 can not be written as the product of the sub quantum states related to the individual quantum numbers ( freedoms ) .",
    "this feature can be embodied by rewriting eq.([psip ] ) and eq.([psim ] ) , i.e. , @xmath29    in fact , as shown in eq.([psip ] ) and eq.([psim ] ) , @xmath27 only include abstract particle symbols , but not some particular physical quantity symbols .",
    "this means that the quantum numbers ( @xmath28 ) is packaged as an entirety in @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) by the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 .",
    "the quantum numbers can not be added in or taken out separately .",
    "furthermore , a particle and an antiparticle are different types of particles .",
    "it means that @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) packages different particles as an entirety . due to these reasons",
    ", we call the quantum states @xmath27 as packaged entanglement states",
    ". this is different to the hyperentanglement or multimode entanglement",
    ". it should be also pointed out that the other physical quantities , i.e. , mass , energy , momentum , and spin , are untouched by the charge conjugation .",
    "thus , the sub quantum states related to these physical quantities should be factored out .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the packaged entanglement states @xmath27 are valid for both elementary particles and composite particles by referring to the charge conjugation .",
    "for composite particles , @xmath27 can be further expressed by their component particles .",
    "for example , a proton @xmath32 is a composite particle made of three quarks @xcite , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes an up quark and @xmath35 denotes a down quark .",
    "thus , the packaged entanglement states of a @xmath36 pair can be written as @xmath37      the packaged entanglement states @xmath27 in eq.([psip ] ) and eq.([psim ] ) are construct on basis of a particle - antiparticle pair in which the total charge is conserved ( zero ) in the wave function collapse . from a mathematical point of view , this is not the only possibility .",
    "there must exist other forms of packaged entanglement states in which the total charge are not conserved in the wave function collapse , i.e. , the total charge are not equal before and after the wave function collapse .",
    "the physical properties and possible applications of these new packaged entanglement states are unknown yet .",
    "in this sub - section we will construct the mathematical expressions for the new packaged entanglement states and show that the wave function collapse does not result in a particle - antiparticle pair , but two identical particles ( either two similar particles or two similar antiparticles ) .",
    "in other words , the total charge is not conserved in the wave function collapse and the c - symmetry is broken .",
    "the new packaged entanglement states can also be used as the quantum channels for particle teleportation .",
    "but the receiver s particle always conjugates to the sender s particle . as mentioned before , the packaged entanglement states @xmath27 are constructed under the constraint condition of zero total charge .",
    "thus , they strictly obey the law of charge conservation .",
    "we shall now remove this constraint condition and construct the new packaged entanglement states which do not obey the law of charge conservation .",
    "let us first study the packaged entanglement states of two particles and then generalize it to @xmath38 particles later .",
    "consider the following two quantum states of a particle pair , @xmath39    applying the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 to @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 where @xmath19 is the total angular momentum quantum number , @xmath10 is the orbital angular momentum quantum number , and @xmath12 is the total spin quantum number .    eq.([operatorc ] ) shows that @xmath40 are also the eigenstates of the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 . the c - parity ( or charge parity ) @xcite depends on the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath42 . as the eigenstates of @xmath5 ,",
    "therefore , @xmath40 must exist .",
    "similar to @xmath27 , the states @xmath40 are also entanglement states because they can not be expressed as the direct product of the particle state and antiparticle state.@xcite furthermore , as the eigenstates of the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 , the entanglement states @xmath40 also package in all the physical properties capable of completely identifying the particles , i.e. , the particle s electric charge ( @xmath8 ) , baryon number ( @xmath9 ) , lepton number ( @xmath10 ) , isospin ( @xmath11 ) , charm ( @xmath5 ) , strangeness ( @xmath12 ) , topness ( @xmath13 ) , and bottomness ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the packaged entanglement states @xmath40 have an interesting property . if a measurement is performed on the particle pair , @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) will collapse and break the c - symmetry ( the symmetry of physical laws under the charge conjugation operator @xmath5 ) @xcite . more specifically ,",
    "if a measurement is performed on @xmath23 , it will collapse into either a particle , or an antiparticle .",
    "if @xmath23 collapse into a particle , then @xmath9 will also collapse into a particle , i.e. , the wave function @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) will collapse into @xmath45 .",

    "this process break the c - symmetry of the particle - antiparticle pair .",
    "therefore , the law of charge conservation does not hold in this process .",
    "the above stated packaged entanglement state can be generalized to a system with @xmath47 particles . because each particle has two states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , there are totally @xmath50 packaged entanglement states , i.e. , @xmath51 } \\left| p \\right\\rangle_{[\\frac{m}{2}]+1 } \\cdots \\left| p \\right\\rangle_m \\pm       \\left| p \\right\\rangle_1 \\left| p \\right\\rangle_2 \\cdots \\left| p \\right\\rangle_{[\\frac{m}{2 } ] } \\left| \\bar{p } \\right\\rangle_{[\\frac{m}{2}]+1 } \\cdots \\left| \\bar{p } \\right\\rangle_m \\right ) .",

    "this means that all the packaged entanglement states in eq.([packagedm ] ) are the eigenstates of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the number of @xmath48s and @xmath55 be the number of @xmath49s , we have the following conclusions :    if @xmath56 in the first half ( or the second half ) combinations on the right side of a state in eq.([packagedm ] ) ( @xmath57 must be an even number ) , then the c - symmetry holds in the collapse of this wave function .",

    "if a system includes an even number of particles , then there are totally @xmath58 ^ 2 $ ] states have c - symmetry ( @xmath65 ) , and the remained @xmath66 ^ 2 $ ] states have c - symmetry breaking .",
    "although the experimental method for creating particle - antiparticle pairs in the packaged entanglement states @xmath27 are unavailable at present , we can still use the following experimental scheme to test whether a particle - antiparticle pair is in one of the packaged entanglement states .",
    "eq.([psip ] ) and eq.([psim ] ) show that each particle ( @xmath23 or @xmath9 ) in the packaged entanglement states is a mixture of a particle and an antiparticle , or a hermaphroditic particle .",
    "when @xmath23 ( or @xmath9 ) encounters an external particle @xmath67 ( from a particle source ) , the particle - antiparticle annihilation phenomenon @xcite will force @xmath23 ( or @xmath9 ) to collapse into a particle conjugating to particle @xmath67 ( with every internal quantum number of @xmath23 opposite to that of @xmath67 ) and then annihilate each other .",

    "let us now choose @xmath106 to show that the collapse of these states satisfy the sakharov conditions @xcite .      currently , there is no direct experimental evidences @xcite that show the violation baryon number @xmath9 .",

    "one can see that the packaged entanglement state @xmath106 is similar to an `` unstable '' state , but the separable states @xmath143 , or @xmath144 are similar to `` stable '' states .",

    "but we still need to answer the question why the particles created in early universe are in the packaged entanglement states ( in which the particles are indeterminate ) , but not in the separable states ( in which the particles are determinate ) .",
    "this could be explained by the idea of universal selection from the universal darwinism ( generalized darwinism ) @xcite .    by applying the theory of darwinism to the packaged entanglement state",
    ", we will show that : _ the particles created in the separable states are short - lived due to the particle - antiparticle annihilation , but the particles created in the packaged entanglement states with c - symmetry breaking can be long - lived and survive until today_. because the selection criteria used here is based on the packaged entanglement states , we shall call such a selection process as `` entanglement selection '' for the purpose of specifying its unique feature .    according to dirac s theory @xcite",
    ", particles must be created in particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "this condition can be satisfied by a separable state with equal amount of particles @xmath48s and antiparticles @xmath49s , i.e. , @xmath156 .",
    "it can also be satisfied by the packaged entanglement states in eq.([packagedm ] ) in which each particle in the first half conjugates to that in the second half ( see the right side of eq.([packagedm ] ) ) .    according to quantum mechanics , each state that satisfies the above particle - antiparticle pair condition is possible to occur .",
    "if a group of elementary particles are created in a separable state , say @xmath156 , then there should be equal amount of particles and antiparticles . in early universe",
    ", these particles and antiparticles should locate in a limited volume and they should annihilate each other . in this sense , the particles created in the separable state @xmath157 wo nt live long and will go back to radiation quickly . afterwards , the radiation ( or energy ) creates a group of new particles again .",
    "this creation - annihilation process will continue and finally stop until the particles happen to be created in one of the packaged entanglement states , which collapse and break the c - symmetry .",
    "finally , an unequal amount of particles and antiparticles is obtained according to eq.([packagedm ] ) .",
    "finally , a small amount of antiparticles will annihilate an equal amount of particles .",
    "these short - lived particles pairs will go back to radiation again and start a new entanglement selection process .",
    "but the remnant particles that are not annihilated will survive .",
    "the above entanglement selection principle also indicates that it is a random result that our universe is made of matter , but not anti - matter .",
    "more specifically , it depends on the initial condition at the moment of wave function collapse .",
    "for example , if the packaged entanglement state @xmath106 collapse and happened to roll into @xmath143 , then an universe made of matter is created . however ,",
    "if @xmath106 happened to roll into @xmath144 , then an anti - universe made of antimatter is created .",
    "we have studied the mechanism of baryogenesis based on the collapse of packaged entanglement states with c - symmetry breaking . in this section",
    ", we would like to further discussion its characters by comparing with other existing mechanisms of baryogenesis .    as mentioned before , the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the observable universe",
    "@xcite could be interpreted in two ways : 1 .",
    "the universe started with more matter than antimatter ; 2 .",
    "the universe started with equal amount of matter and antimatter but later became matter dominated due to some physical laws .",
    "the mechanism proposed in this work belongs to the second way .",
    "in fact , the baryon asymmetry is generated after the inflation .",
    "this is similar to the other existing theories of baryogenesis .",
    "the baryogenesis theory proposed in this work used quantum mechanics to describe the mechanism that produced the matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "the main point is the collapse of wave function of the packaged entanglement states .",
    "however , the other baryogenesis theories @xcite used quantum field theory and statistical mechanics to describe the mechanism of baryogenesis .",
    "the main points in these theories are the interactions between elementary particles .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the baryogenesis based on packaged entanglement states may indicate the possibility of multiverse @xcite .",
    "it at least does not rule out the possibility of multiverse .",
    "this is because the entanglement selection principle results in the random origin of the universe , which means that the structure and composition of a universe is not unique .",
    "this multiple origin indicates that there is no reason why the existence of universe is unique , but not multiple .",
    "in early quantum teleportation protocols @xcite , alice sends out the information of particle @xmath67 by performing a bell measurement on particles @xmath67 and @xmath23 .",
    "this measurement has four possible results .",
    "thereafter , alice needs a classical channel to inform bob about her bell measurement result . in the present particle teleportation protocol",
    ", however , alice sent out the information of @xmath67 by annihilating @xmath67 with @xmath23 .",
    "alice s experimental result is fixed by the particle - antiparticle annihilation phenomenon .",
    "thus , bob s result has a fixed relationship with that of @xmath67 and he can decode the information directly . the classical channel between alice and bob is then removed .    in the packaged entanglement states ,",
    "every additive quantum number is symmetrical ( with opposite sign ) .",
    "thus , the particle teleportation process satisfies a number of conservation principles , i.e. , charge ( q ) conservation , baryon number ( @xmath9 ) conservation , lepton number ( @xmath10 ) conservation , isospin ( @xmath11 ) conservation , charm ( @xmath5 ) conservation , strangeness ( @xmath12 ) conservation , topness ( @xmath13 ) conservation , and bottomness ( @xmath14 ) conservation .",
    "in addition , it also satisfies the principles of linear momentum conservation , total energy conservation , and angular momentum conservation .    in the particle teleportation process",
    ", alice can control particle @xmath9 to be a particle or an antiparticle at a distance .",
    "in other words , alice can control the gender of bob s particle @xmath9 at a distance because @xmath9 is a hermaphroditic particle in the packaged entanglement state .",
    "therefore , alice can control particle @xmath9 whether to annihilate or not to annihilate with its environment particles at will .",
    "this property may be found important applications in medicine , such as positron emission tomography ( pet ) @xcite , positron annihilation spectroscopy ( pas ) , and the band structure measurements in solid state physics as well .",
    "it could also be applied in remote control .",

    "different to early studies , the particle teleportation protocol introduced here does not need a classical channel due to the particle - antiparticle annihilation phenomenon .",
    "it is also shown that a packaged entanglement state can be transferred from two particles to another two particles . in the particle teleportation process with the c - symmetry breaking packaged entanglement states ,",
    "a particle is always teleported to the receiver as a particle conjugating to the original particle . in the entanglement transfer process with the c - symmetry breaking packaged entanglement states",
