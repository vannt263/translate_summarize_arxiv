    "the @xmath4 absorber towards b0218 + 357 has a far smaller velocity spread than the @xmath20 system towards b1830@xmath21210 @xcite , making it a better candidate for accurate redshift measurements .",
    "the carbon monosulfide ( cs )  1 - 0 line [ rest frequency : 48.990957(2 )  ghz ; @xcite ] is a good rotational transition for the comparison with the nh@xmath0 inversion lines because it is known to be unsaturated in the @xmath4 absorber @xcite and it lies at a frequency relatively close to that of the nh@xmath0  ( 1,1 ) lines .",
    "the formaldehyde ( h@xmath1co )  0@xmath2 - 1@xmath3 line [ rest frequency : @xmath22  ghz ; @xcite ] was chosen as a second rotational transition , to obtain an estimate of systematic effects in the above comparison ; this too is known to be unsaturated in the @xmath4 absorber @xcite .",

    "was also carried out to the cs and h@xmath1co rotational lines alone ( i.e. _ without _ including the nh@xmath0 inversion lines ) .",

    "an excellent summary of the systematic effects inherent in the comparison between rotational and inversion lines in the @xmath4 absorber is given by @xcite .",
    "these include the following : ( 1 )  the assumption that different transitions have the same number of spectral components , and at the same redshifts , ( 2 )  the background source morphology is frequency - dependent , implying that the nh@xmath0 and rotational transitions might arise along slightly different sightlines , ( 3 )  the background source flux density ( and hence morphology ) varies with time , so observations at different epochs might probe different sightlines , ( 4 )  the assumption of lte for the nh@xmath0 hyperfine structure , ( 5 )  saturation effects if highly - saturated lines [ e.g. the hco@xmath19 and hcn lines used by @xcite ] are used , and ( 6 )  local velocity offsets between the species giving rise to the transitions .",
    "as noted by @xcite , all these effects could yield significant contributions to their systematic errors .",
    "for example , the inversion and rotational transitions used by @xcite were at very different frequencies , @xmath47  ghz and @xmath48  ghz ; changes in the background source morphology could thus result in different sightlines in the different transitions .",
    "the nh@xmath0 and hco@xmath19/hcn observations were separated by a few years , implying that temporal variability in the source morphology could also be an issue , especially given that saturated transitions were used in the analysis .",
    "finally , the nh@xmath0 spectra were of too low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to detect the nh@xmath0 hyperfine structure and to test for non - lte effects .",
    "most of the above issues have been directly addressed in the present work .",
    "all three transitions used in the analysis are unsaturated and have been observed at high s / n , and with the same telescope .",
    "the two outlying nh@xmath0 hyperfine components ( at @xmath49  km / s relative to the strongest component ) in the nh@xmath0  ( 1,1 ) line have also been clearly detected ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1][a ] ) .",
    "as noted by @xcite , non - lte effects resulting in hyperfine `` anomalies '' should cause the satellite hyperfine components ( with @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the quadrupole quantum number ) to have different optical depths .",
    "no evidence for such non - lte conditions is apparent in the @xmath49  km / s satellite hyperfine components in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1][a ] ; the optical depths are found to agree within the noise .",
    "we note , finally , that the systematic error of @xmath52 in the result of @xcite contains two contributions : ( 1 )  @xmath53 because spectral components detected in the hco@xmath19 and hcn spectra may not be detected in the nh@xmath0 spectra , due either to the large frequency difference between the inversion and rotation lines or to the fact that the hco@xmath19 and hcn lines are optically thick , and ( 2 )  @xmath54 due to the possibility of non - lte effects in the nh@xmath0 spectra .",
    "our choice of rotational lines and the higher sensitivity of our nh@xmath0 spectra implies that neither of these are significant sources of systematic error in the present analysis .",
    "@xcite find that nh@xmath0 column densities correlate best with cs and h@xmath1co column densities in galactic diffuse clouds ; cs and h@xmath1co are thus likely to be the best rotational transitions for the inversion / rotation comparison , as the correlation in column densities suggests that the three species are likely to arise in the same part of a gas cloud .",
    "galactic absorption has also been detected in all three species towards two quasars , b0355 + 508 and b0415 + 379 @xcite ; both sightlines show two components in all species , with line velocities agreeing within 0.2  km / s [ see table  1 of @xcite , table  6 of @xcite and table  a1 of @xcite ] ; local velocity offsets between the species thus appear to be small .",
    "further , the rotational and inversion line frequencies are much closer here than in the comparison of @xcite , with the redshifted nh@xmath0 , cs , and h@xmath1co lines at @xmath47  ghz , @xmath55  ghz and @xmath56  ghz , respectively .",
    "changes in source morphology with frequency are thus a less important issue here than in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "a direct test comes from the comparison between the two rotational lines , whose frequencies differ by a factor of @xmath57 , comparable to the ratio of the cs and nh@xmath0 frequencies ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the cs - h@xmath1co comparison also provides an estimate of the systematic error due to local velocity offsets between different species in the clouds .",
    "this test found the cs and h@xmath1co line redshifts to agree within the noise ; the @xmath41 error in this comparison has been used to quantify the systematic error due to both local velocity offsets and differing background source morphology at the different line frequencies .",
    "finally , similar velocity offsets ( consistent within the errors ) were obtained in the independent comparisons between the nh@xmath0 and cs lines , and the nh@xmath0 and h@xmath1co lines .",
    "a source of systematic effects that could not be directly addressed here is time variability in the background source morphology , which might yield different sightlines through the absorbing clouds at different epochs [ @xcite ; see @xcite for the @xmath20 lens towards b1830@xmath21210 ] .",
    "unfortunately , the redshifted nh@xmath0 , cs and h@xmath1co transitions towards b0218 + 357 require different gbt receivers and can not be observed simultaneously .",
    "the present nh@xmath0 , cs and h@xmath1co observations were carried out between january and august  2008 ; the possibility that the weak offset between the inversion and rotational lines arises due to small changes in the sightline thus can not be ruled out .",
    "further , the agreement between cs and h@xmath1co velocities does not rule out the possibility that nitrogen - bearing species like nh@xmath0 arise at different velocities than carbon - bearing species like cs and h@xmath1co .",
    "this can only be tested by using rotational transitions of other nitrogen - bearing species ( e.g. hc@xmath0n , ch@xmath0cn , etc ) .",
    "while there are two possible sources of systematic error that we are as yet unable to quantify , the present data show no statistically - significant ( @xmath59 ) evidence for changes in the proton - electron mass ratio .",

    "note , however , that @xcite used single - gaussian fits for the nh@xmath0 and hc@xmath0n lines towards b1830@xmath21210 , although it is clear from the profiles of other unsaturated lines ( e.g. cs ) that at least three absorbing `` clouds '' are present along the sightline .",
    "further , the gbt spectra in the strongest [ ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) ] nh@xmath0 lines towards b1830@xmath21210 were severely affected by radio frequency interference ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of these issues on the results of @xcite is unclear , but the error budget is likely to increase . at higher redshifts ,",

    "it is necessary to assume a model for the variation of @xmath5 with time . for linear variation ,",
    "the present result yields @xmath62 per year , more than an order of magnitude better than the best ( model - dependent ) laboratory constraint on changes in @xmath5 @xcite .    in conclusion",
