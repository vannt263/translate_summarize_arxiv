    "radio emission from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) have been sought primarily to study the circumstellar medium @xcite . however , starting with type ibc sn1998bw , associated with the under - luminous gamma - ray burst grb980425 @xcite , radio observations have also been used a tracer of relativistic ejecta @xcite .",
    "this event prompted a storm of publications : sn1998bw was the most luminous radio supernova ( at early times ) , showed strong variability and produced copious gamma - ray emission relative to ordinary sne ibc .",
    "these data provided the first observational evidence that at least some sne ibc are associated with grbs ( e.g.  @xcite , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    to further explore the connection between grbs and sne ibc",
    ", we began a radio survey of local type ibc supernovae .",
    "our survey was motivated by two simple phenomenological questions : ( 1 ) what is the prevalence of sn1998bw - like supernovae ? , and ( 2 ) is there a continuum between ordinary sne and grbs as traced by their relativistic ejecta ?",
    "in @xcite we reported the first three years of the survey .",
    "we found that most sne ibc are not detectable with current radio sensitivity , with limits reaching @xmath7 that of the peak brightness of sn1998bw .",
    "clearly , luminous sn1998bw - like supernovae are rare ( less than 3% ) and those within an order of magnitude of sn1998bw are uncommon ( less than 10% ) .    here , we present radio observations of sn2003l , the first sn ibc with a radio luminosity comparable to sn1998bw . while there is no evidence for mildly - relativistic ejecta , the radio emitting ejecta of sn2003l are unusually energetic .",
    "this discovery suggests the existence of a sub - class of sne ibc with similar energetics to sn1998bw and even weaker central engines , if any .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : observations from the very large array ( vla ) , the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( cxo ) are described in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] and  [ sec : xray ] .",
    "preliminary estimates of the energy and velocity are presented in  [ sec : ep ] .",
    "modeling of the radio light - curves is discussed in sections  [ sec : ssa ] and [ sec : ffa ] assuming the dominant absorption is from internal synchrotron self - absorption and external free - free absorption , respectively , modeling of the x - ray emission follows as  [ sec : xray_model ] . in the discussion (  [ sec :",
    "disc ] ) we conclude by addressing the nature of sn2003l .",
    "sn2003l was optically discovered on 2003 january 12.15 ut , offset 9.0 w and 1\".5 n from the center of ngc 3506 @xcite and at a distance of @xmath8 mpc @xcite .",
    "in our first observation with the very large array ( vla ) , on 2003 january 26.2 ut , we detected a radio source coincident with the optical position at @xmath9 ( @xmath100.1 arcsec in each coordinate ) with flux density of @xmath11jy at 8.5 ghz .",
    "this , and subsequent observations at 4.9 , 8.5 , 15.0 and 22.5 ghz , are summarized in table  1 .",
    "all observations were taken in standard continuum observing mode with a bandwidth of @xmath12 mhz .",
    "we used 3c286 for flux calibration , and for phase referencing we used calibrators j1118 + 125 , j1120 + 134 and j1103 + 119 .",
    "data were reduced using standard packages within the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .    as seen in table  1 ,",
    "observations were taken in each of the four vla configurations .",
    "the decreased spatial resolution of the c and d configurations resulted in detection of diffuse host galaxy emission surrounding the supernova , primarily affecting the low ( @xmath13 ghz ) frequency observations ( figure  [ fig : sn_contours ] ) . at 8.5 ghz the host galaxy extends @xmath14 arcsec , but is resolved away on baselines @xmath15 . by restricting the uv range to exclude shorter baselines , we measured the flux density of the supernova with minimal contribution from the host galaxy .",
    "measurements at higher frequencies and in other vla configurations were made by fitting a gaussian to the sn emission and solving for the integrated intensity .",
    "figure  [ fig : lt_curves ] shows the sn2003l radio light - curves assuming an approximate explosion date of 2003 january 1.0 ut as derived from optical data @xcite .",
    "the radio light - curves evolve as @xmath16 before the peak , exhibit a broad maximum and fade as @xmath17 . the spectral index ( @xmath18 with @xmath19 )",
    "is observed as @xmath20 in the optically thin regime ( figure  [ fig : indices ] ) .",
    "complimentary to our vla campaign , we obtained a single observation of sn2003l using the very large baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "the six hour observation began on 2003 march 7.30 ut ( @xmath21 days ) , and was taken in standard continuum mode with a bandwidth of @xmath22 mhz centered on the observing frequency of 4.9 ghz .",
    "fringe calibrations were applied using 3c273 and phase referencing was conducted using j1103 + 1158 at an angular distance of 0.9 degrees from the sn .",
    "we detect sn2003l at a position of @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( j2000.0 ) with a positional uncertainty of 10 mas in each coordinate ( figure  [ fig : vlba ] ) .",
    "we note that these errors are dominated by the positional uncertainty of j1103 + 1158 , assumed to be at @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( j2000.0 ) . using the vlba utilities within aips",
    ", we find a flux density for the supernova of @xmath27jy within the @xmath28 mas beam .",
    "we note that there is no emission from the host galaxy at this resolution . at a distance of 92 mpc",
    ", this unresolved vlba detection places a direct constraint on the size of the expanding ejecta of @xmath29 cm and an average expansion speed of @xmath30 during the first 65 days after the explosion .",
    "we observed sn2003l with the _ chandra _ acis - s detector beginning at 2003 february 10.15 ut ( @xmath31 days ) . during the 30 ksec observation",
    ", we detected @xmath32 counts from the supernova @xcite .",
    "for spectral extraction we adopt a source aperture of 2.46  arcsec , which encloses approximately 98% of the flux of an on - axis point - source at 1  kev ( the peak of our raw photon counts spectrum ) .",
    "our aperture correction is therefore minimal by comparison to our @xmath3320% flux uncertainties ( see below ) .",
    "background counts are selected from an annular region extending from 2.46  arcsec to 7.38  arcsec from the source ; in general larger background regions are preferred for _ chandra _ data analysis but the extended emission from the host galaxy makes a more local selection preferable in this case ( see figure  [ fig : cxo ] ) .",

    "for a thermal bremsstrahlung spectral fit we find the plasma temperature has @xmath40kev at 90% confidence , with a best - fit value of 6.7kev that is unconstrained from higher energies",
    ". the relatively small number of counts enables satisfactory fits ( reduced chi - squared values of @xmath41 ; 5 degrees of freedom ) for both models , with the neutral hydrogen absorption applied to either a power - law or thermal bremsstrahlung continuum .    our source count rate is @xmath42cts / ksec in the acis - s3 detector .",
    "this corresponds to a 0.55.0  kev flux for our spectral models of approximately @xmath43 in either case . extrapolating to the full 210  kev x - ray band ,",
    "the corresponding fluxes are @xmath44 for the power law model and @xmath45 for the thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the associated x - ray luminosity is thus @xmath46 erg / s and @xmath47 erg / s for the power - law and thermal models , respectively . in comparison with other x - ray supernovae",
    ", sn2003l is among the most luminous ever detected , only a factor of @xmath48 fainter than sn1998bw at a comparable epoch @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the energy and expansion velocity of the ejecta producing the radio emission . as a preliminary constraint",
    ", we estimate the brightness temperature , @xmath49 , of sn 2003l and compare it with robust constraints imposed by the inverse compton catastrophe ( icc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the brightness temperature of a source with angular radius , @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 compact sources with @xmath52k cool rapidly via inverse compton scattering .",
    "as an initial estimate for the physical size of the supernova , we first assume that the optical expansion velocity of @xmath53 @xcite can be used as an average speed to describe the motion of the radio bright ejecta . using our approximate explosion date",

    "the brightness temperature is @xmath58 k , just below of the inverse compton catastrophe ( icc ) limit .",
    "this exercise provides no evidence for relativistic ejecta , therefore suggesting that sn2003l expands with a modest sub - relativistic velocity .    for radio sources dominated by synchrotron - self absorption ( ssa ) , the brightness temperature can be further constrained to @xmath59 k. by assuming equipartition between the energy in electrons ( @xmath60 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath61 ) , we derive an estimate of the velocity and a lower limit on the kinetic energy of radio emitting material .",
    "this approach has been used extensively in discussion of extra - galactic sources and was more recently applied to supernovae @xcite .",
    "the method requires three observables at any single epoch : the spectral peak frequency , @xmath62 , the peak flux density , @xmath63 , and the spectral index of the optically thin emission , @xmath19 . here , @xmath64 for electrons accelerated into a power - law distribution , @xmath65 above a minimum lorentz factor , @xmath66 . following @xcite and @xcite ,",

    "the minimum energy of the ejecta is thus @xmath78 erg and the magnetic field is @xmath79 g. these constraints alone demand that sn2003l is among the most energetic type ibc supernovae in terms of radio - emitting ejecta , second only to sn1998bw .",
    "we note that additional absorption terms ( e.g. free - free absorption ) and the inclusion of shocked protons serve to increase the equipartition energy estimate .",
    "equipartition analyses may also be used to roughly constrain the minimum electron lorentz factor and the characteristic synchrotron frequency , @xmath80 . equating particle kinetic energy across the shock discontinuity",
    ", we find    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the average lorentz factor of the electrons and @xmath83 is the velocity of the ejecta .",

    "in the appendix we present a rigorous formulation of the temporal and spectral evolution of synchrotron emission arising from sub - relativistic supernova ejecta . this prescription , based on the formalism of @xcite , is generalized to include the cases where @xmath80 , is greater than the self - absorption frequency , @xmath90 , and where @xmath91 .",

    "a consistent , non - relativistic solution to the @xcite model could not be found for the case of sn2003l .",
    "x - ray emission in supernovae can be produced by three processes @xcite : ( 1 ) non - thermal synchrotron emission from radiating electrons , ( 2 ) thermal ( free - free ) bremsstrahlung emission from material in the circumstellar shock and/or the ejecta reverse shock , and ( 3 ) inverse compton scattering of photospheric photons by relativistic electrons .",
    "we examine each of these scenarios in the context of the bright x - ray emission of sn2003l .      extrapolating the ( optically thin ) synchrotron emission at @xmath239 days from the radio to the x - ray band as @xmath240 with @xmath74 , we find that the synchrotron emission under - predicts the observed x - ray flux by a factor of @xmath241 .",

    "we also note that the flat spectrum , @xmath247 , of the observed x - rays is inconsistent with the steep synchrotron spectral index observed in the radio bands , @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the x - ray emission is not due to synchrotron processes .      in a scenario dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung processes ,",
    "the x - ray emission is produced by the forward shock plowing into circumstellar material and/or the reverse shock heating of the ejecta . in this case",
    ", the strength of the x - ray emission depends of the density of the emitting material .",
    "the shocked material then cools by free - free emission processes . for an @xmath248 wind density profile , free - free luminosity from the forward or reverse shock",

    "using the mass loss rate derived from model 1 , the _ combined _ free - free luminosity from the forward and reverse shocks is therefore @xmath256 , and a factor @xmath257 fainter than that observed . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume the x - ray emission _ must _ be dominated by free - free processes , then this implies a mass loss rate of @xmath258 ( @xmath181 ) , which is inconsistent with both the rate predicted by radio ssa models as well as that associated with ffa modeling ( section  [ sec : ffa ] ) .",
    "x - ray emission from supernovae can also be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) cooling of the relativistic electrons by the optical photons as was claimed to be important for the x - ray emission of sn2002ap @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the ratio of energy densities in magnetic fields , @xmath259 , and photons , @xmath260 , is given roughly by    @xmath261    where @xmath262 is the optically thin synchrotron flux in the radio band and @xmath263 is the corresponding x - ray flux . at @xmath31 days , the observed radio flux was @xmath264 and the x - ray flux was @xmath265 , giving a ratio of @xmath266 .    assuming the timescale for compton cooling is comparable to the epoch",
    "_ chandra _ observations , @xmath267 days , and using equations ( 1418 ) of @xcite , we are able to roughly match the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "since we see no evidence for ic cooling affects within our radio light - curves , we place a lower limit of @xmath268 ghz .",
    "this implies constraints on the magnetic field and shock velocity of @xmath269 g and @xmath270 , consistent with the values predicted from ssa radio analyses (   [ sec : ssa ] ) .",
    "the corresponding limit on the energy density in magnetic fields is thus @xmath271 and is therefore consistent with the value found through ssa model 1 (   [ sec : ssa ] ) .",
    "we note that in these estimates , a bolometric luminosity of @xmath272 has been very roughly estimated based on fitting the sn2003l optical light - curve @xcite .",
    "while inverse compton cooling appears to be a feasible process to produce the luminous x - ray emission of sn2003l , it predicts a steep spectral index , @xmath273 , which is inconsistent with the observed value of @xmath247 ( @xmath274 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the poor photon statistics may be responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "as the first type ibc supernova with a radio and x - ray luminosity within an order of magnitude of sn1998bw , sn2003l is clearly an unusual event . here , we summarize our findings .",
    "both ssa and ffa models ( sections  [ sec : ssa ] and [ sec : ffa ] ) show that the energy of the ejecta is @xmath275 erg and nearly comparable to that of sn1998bw at a similar epoch . in case 1",
    "the equipartition and ssa analyses predict a sub - relativistic velocity , @xmath276 , and a relatively low mass loss rate , @xmath277 which are roughly consistent with a scenario where inverse compton scattering produces the observed x - ray emission . in case 2 ,",
    "the complex ffa models reproduce the observed radio light - curves well , yet they imply a highly relativistic ejecta speed , @xmath278 , or a huge energy output of @xmath279 erg , as well as a high mass loss rate of @xmath280 which over - predicts the observed x - ray emission assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung emission model .",
    "our vlba observation at @xmath21 days implies an ejecta size which is inconsistent with the extreme velocities required by the complex ffa model in case 2 . only by deviating far from equipartition and significantly increasing the total energy of the ejecta",
    "can this inconsistency be resolved .",
    "moreover , the predicted mass loss rate is at least two orders of magnitude above the observed rates from wolf - rayet stars . in conclusion , we find case 2 to be infeasible and we therefore adopt case 1 the most likely scenario .",
    "we note that case 1 predicts a mass loss rate comparable to the low end of values observed for local wolf - rayet stars .    while similar to sn1998bw in radio luminosity and ejecta energy , a main distinguishing characteristic between sn2003l and sn1998bw is their shock velocity : while the radio ejecta of sn1998bw attained mildly - relativistic speeds , that of sn2003l was clearly sub - relativistic as shown in section  [ sec : ssa ] .",
    "this discrepancy is echoed by optical spectroscopy which showed photospheric velocities in excess of @xmath281 for sn1998bw @xcite and @xmath282 for sn2003l @xcite .",
    "therefore , we see that for sn1998bw , mildly - relativistic ejecta was coupled with bright radio emission , while for sn2003l the emission is bright _ despite _ the modest ejecta velocities . the question is thus , why is the radio ejecta of sn2003l especially luminous and energetic ?    one hypothesis considers the distribution of kinetic energy according to ejecta velocity .",
    "sn1998bw is a clear case where a significant fraction of the explosion energy has been deposited into mildly - relativistic material . for sn2003l , however , the bulk of the energy is coupled to sub - relativistic ejecta . @xcite",
    "have shown that in some cases , high velocity ejecta can be produced from a whip effect racing down the ejecta .",
    "the observed diversity in the coupling between velocity and energy could therefore be intrinsic to the sn ibc population .",
    "a similar situation is observed for gamma - ray bursts which partition their energy into ultra - relativistic emission ( @xmath283-rays ) and mildly - relativistic afterglow emission ( x - rays , optical , radio ) by variable fractions .    through our ongoing radio surveys of local sne ibc and cosmological gamma - ray bursts , we continue to map out the energetics of these explosions .",
    "our goal is to understand the link between type ibc supernovae and grbs by studying properties of the explosion ( ejecta velocity and kinetic energy ) in addition to those of the progenitor star ( csm density profile and evolutionary mass loss rate ) . through these further studies ,",
