    "the theoretical concepts of brownian motors and ratchet transport @xcite have been experimentally realized in a variety of systems .",
    "examples are : cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , colloidal particles in holographic optical trapping patterns @xcite , ratchet cellular automata @xcite , superconducting films with periodic arrays of asymmetric pinning sites @xcite , to mention only a few .    when we study the motion of brownian motors , the natural transport measure is a conveniently defined average asymptotic velocity @xmath0 of the brownian motors .",
    "it describes how much time the typical particle needs to overcome a given distance in the asymptotic ( long - time ) regime .",
    "this velocity , however , is not the only relevant transport criterion .",
    "other attributes can also be important . in order to establish these",
    ", we consider the two following aspects : the quality of the transport and the energetic efficiency of such a system .        in fig .",
    "[ mmfig1 ] , one can identify two different groups a and b of random trajectories of the brownian particle ; both possess the same average drift velocity @xmath1 . however , it is obvious upon inspection that the dynamical properties of these two groups of trajectories are different .",
    "the particles from the group a travel more or less coherently together while the particles from the group b spread out as time goes by . if we fix the distance @xmath2 then most particles from the group a reach this distance at about the same time @xmath3 , while for @xmath3 most of the b trajectories either stay behind or have already proceeded to more distant positions .",
    "it is thus evident that the noise - assisted , directed transport for the particles in the group a is more effective than in the group b.    there is still another efficiency aspect related to brownian motor transport .",
    "this refers to the external energy input into the system which may be essential in practical applications .",
    "we like to know how much of this input energy is converted into useful work , namely into directed cargo transport , and how much of it gets wasted . since motors move in a dissipative environment , we need to know how much of the input energy is being spent for moving a certain distance against the acting friction force . fig .",
    "[ mmfig2 ] depicts trajectories representing different motor scenarios .",
    "the motor c moves forward unidirectionally , while the motor d moves in a more complicated manner : its motion alternates small oscillations and fast episodes , mostly in the forward direction , but sometimes also in the backward direction .",
    "again the mean velocity in both cases is the same , however , the particle c uses energy pumped from the environment to proceed constantly forward while the particle d wastes part of its energy to perform oscillations and back - turns . by simply inspecting these schematic pictures one can guess immediately when directed transport is more effective .",
    "we note that in fig .",
    "[ mmfig1 ] , the cases a and b can be characterized by the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath4 , i.e. , by the spreading of fluctuations in the position space while the cases c and d in fig .",
    "2 can be characterized by the variance of velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the three quantities @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 can be combined to define two important characteristics of transport , namely the efficiency of noise rectification and the so - called pclet number @xcite .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in the following section , we detail the model of an inertial",
    "rocked brownian motor . in section 3 ,",
    "we present a general discussion of the efficiency measures of brownian motors . in section 4 ,",
    "a description of the ratchet based on point processes is introduced . in sections 5 and 6 ,",
    "our numerical findings are analyzed in the context of the optimization conditions for transport of inertial brownian motors .",
    "a summary is provided in section 7 .",
    "the archetype of the inertial brownian motor is represented by a classical particle of mass @xmath7 moving in a spatially periodic and asymmetric potential @xmath8 with period @xmath9 and barrier height @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the particle is driven by an external , unbiased , time - periodic force of amplitude @xmath11 and angular frequency @xmath12 ( or period @xmath13 ) .",
    "the system is additionally subjected to thermal noise @xmath14 .    ,",
    "eqs ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) . ]",
    "the dynamics of the system is modeled by the langevin equation @xcite @xmath15 where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time and a prime denotes a differentiation with respect to the brownian motor coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 denotes the stokes friction coefficient , @xmath18 the boltzmann constant and @xmath19 is the temperature .",
    "the thermal fluctuations due to the coupling of the particle with the environment are modeled by a zero - mean , gaussian white noise @xmath14 with auto - correlation function @xmath20 satisfying einstein s fluctuation - dissipation relation .    upon introducing characteristic length scale and time scale , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lan1 ] ) can be rewritten in dimensionless form , namely @xmath21 with @xcite @xmath22 the characteristic time @xmath23 is the time a particle of mass @xmath7 needs to move a distance @xmath24 under the influence of the constant force @xmath25 when starting with velocity zero .",
    "the remaining re - scaled parameters are :    * the friction coefficient @xmath26 is the ratio of the two characteristic times , @xmath23 and the relaxation time of the velocity degree of freedom , i.e. , @xmath27 , * the potential @xmath28 has unit period and unit barrier height @xmath29 , * the amplitude @xmath30 and the frequency @xmath31 ( or the period @xmath32 ) , * the zero - mean white noise @xmath33 has auto - correlation function @xmath34 with re - scaled noise intensity @xmath35 .    from now on , we will use only the dimensionless variables and shall omit the `` hat '' for all quantities in eq .",
    "( [ nlbw ] ) .    for the asymmetric ratchet potential @xmath36 we consider a linear superposition of three spatial harmonics @xcite , @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 normalizes the barrier height to unity and the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 determine the ratchet profile .",
    "below , we analyze the case when @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath43 .",
    "this potential is shown as a bold ( red ) line in fig .",
    "[ mmfig3 ] .",
    "as already elucidated above , there are several quantities that characterize the effectiveness of directed transport .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient , describing the fluctuations around the average position of the particles , is defined as d_eff = _ t , where the brackets @xmath44 denote an average over the initial conditions of position and velocity and over all realizations of the thermal noise .",
    "the coefficient @xmath4 can also be introduced via a generalized green - kubo relation which we detail in the appendix .",
    "intuitively , if the stationary velocity is large and the spread of trajectories is small , the diffusion coefficient is small and the transport is more effective . to quantify this",
    ", we can introduce the dimensionless pclet number pe @xcite by use of a double - averaging procedure , i.e. , = , where the `` double - average '' @xmath45 denotes the average of the asymptotic velocity over one cycle of the external drive , i.e. , v = _ t _ 0^t v(t ) dt = _ 0 ^ 2/ v(t)_as dt , where the average @xmath46 in the second integral refers to the asymptotic periodic state .",
    "originally , the pclet number pe arises in problems of heat transfer in fluids where it stands for the ratio of heat advection to diffusion .",
    "when the pclet number is small , the random motion dominates ; when it is large , the ordered and regular motion dominates .",
    "the value of the pclet number depends on some characteristic length scale of the system .",
    "dealing with ratchets the most adequate choice for such length scale is the period of the periodic potential , which in re - scaled units is equal to @xmath47 .",
    "the second aspect of the motor trajectories we want to control has to do with the fluctuations of the velocity @xmath48 . in the long - time regime , it is characterized by the variance @xmath49 . the brownian motor moves with an actual velocity @xmath48 , which is typically contained within the interval @xmath50 now , if @xmath51 , the brownian motor may possibly move for some time in the direction opposite to its average velocity @xmath52 and the directed transport becomes less efficient .",
    "if we want to optimize the effectiveness of the motor motion we must introduce a measure for the efficiency @xmath53 that accounts for the velocity fluctuations , too , namely @xcite @xmath54 this definition follows from an energy balance of the underlying equation of motion ( [ nlbw ] ) ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "if the variance of velocity @xmath55 is reduced , the energetic efficiency ( [ eta ] ) increases and the transport of the brownian motor becomes more efficient .",
    "the running trajectories can be characterized in a coarse grained way by only counting the events when a trajectory traverses from one potential well into a neighboring one , and by disregarding the details of the intra - well motion , see figure [ mmfig4 ] . in this way , a point process can be introduced that can be investigated in a standard way @xcite .",
    "most , though not all , of the quantities describing the original continuous process can be retrieved from the so defined point process .    for this purpose",
    "we introduce two random , natural numbers @xmath56 , where @xmath57 stands for right ( r ) and left ( l ) .",
    "the number @xmath58 is given by the number of barrier crossings towards the right within the @xmath59-th period of the driving , i.e. in the time between @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the respective number of barrier crossings to the left",
    "is denoted by @xmath62 . the difference n_k",
    "= n_k^r - n_k^l indicates that during a temporal period @xmath63 the particle has covered the distance @xmath64 .",
    "hence the average , asymptotic velocity is given by @xmath65 analogously , the effective diffusion coefficient is determined by the relation d_eff = n^2 2 t = .",
    "a related quantity is the fano factor @xmath66 @xcite , defined here as the fluctuation to the first moment ratio f = n^2 n . as such , the fano factor provides a quantitative measure of the relative number fluctuations or the relative randomness of the process ; in the case of a poisson process @xmath67 .    on the other hand , from ( [ factors ] ) , ( [ v ] ) and ( [ deff ] ) it follows that the pclet number can be expressed as = 2 n n^2 .",
    "this quantifier is thus related to the fano factor via the relation @xmath68 .",
    "the noiseless , deterministic inertial rocked ratchet shows a rather complex behavior and , in distinct contrast to overdamped rocked brownian motors @xcite , often exhibits a chaotic dynamics @xcite . by adding noise ,",
    "one typically activates a diffusive dynamics ; thus allowing for stochastic escape events among possibly coexisting attractors . as analytical mathods to handle these situations effectively",
    "do not exist , we carried out extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we have numerically integrated eq .",
    "( [ nlbw ] ) by the euler method with time step @xmath69 .",
    "the initial conditions for the coordinate @xmath70 were chosen according to a uniform distribution within one cell of the ratchet potential .",
    "the starting velocities of the particles were also distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the first @xmath72 periods @xmath63 of the external force were skipped in order to avoid transient effects .",
    "we employed two tactics of extracting the above characteristics from the generated trajectories . for the estimation of the energetic efficiency ( or velocity fluctuations ) the usual averages over the time ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath74 different realizations were taken . in the the case of the pclet number ( or effective diffusion ) we used the point process approach ( see previous section for details ) ; therefore , only one time average of long - time runs ( @xmath75 ) was required .",
    "$ ] , where @xmath76 normalizes the barrier height to unity .",
    "the forces stemming from such a potential range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the two angular frequencies at the well - bottom and at the barrier - top are the same , reading @xmath79 .",
    "the remaining parameters are : @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the values of the driving amplitude are @xmath83 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath84 and @xmath85 in part ( a ) ( in blue online ) , the particles usually oscillate in a potential well , most of the time performing only a few steps .",
    "this results in an almost zero mean velocity , a very small effective diffusion but with rather large velocity fluctuations . for another set of driving amplitudes : @xmath86 and @xmath87 in part ( b ) ( in green online ) the mean velocity is large , @xmath55 becomes suppressed , but the effective diffusion exhibits an enlargement due to a battle between attractors. part ( c ) : the cases @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( in red online ) correspond to the optimal _ modus operandi _ of the inertial brownian motor - the net drift is maximal and fluctuations get suppressed . ]    typically , there are two possible dynamical states of the ratchet system : a locked state , in which the particle oscillates mostly within one potential well ( cf . the case with amplitude a = 4.73 in fig .",
    "[ mmfig5 ] ) , and a running state , in which the particles surmount the barriers of the potential .",
    "moreover , one can distinguish two classes of running states : either the particle overcomes the barriers without any back - turns ( cf . the case with an amplitude a = 3.70 in fig .",
    "[ mmfig5 ] ) or it undergoes frequent oscillations and back - scattering events ( cf . the case with amplitude a = 4.55 in fig .",
    "[ mmfig5 ] ) . for a small driving amplitude",
    ", we find that the locked behavior is generic implying that the average motor velocity is almost zero , see fig .",
    "[ mmfig5 ] .",
    "if the amplitude is increased up to some critical value , here @xmath90 , the running solutions emerge . around that critical point",
    ", there occurs a battle of attractors and the particle burns energy for both barrier crossings and intra - well oscillations .",
    "this behavior is reflected in an enormous enhancement of the effective diffusion @xcite .    if the driving amplitude is further increased , a regime of optimal transport sets in .",
    "the rapid growth of the average velocity is accompanied by a decline of both the position and the velocity fluctuations .",
    "it means that the trajectories bundle closely together ; note the case @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ mmfig5 ] .",
    "because there are no intra - well oscillations , the energy that gets dissipated per unit distance , is minimal .    at even larger drive amplitudes an upper threshold is approached ( in the present case this threshold",
    "is located at around @xmath91 ) where the velocity sharply decreases to a value close to zero .",
    "moreover , the diffusion coefficient is small and the velocity fluctuations are large , cf . the case with amplitude @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ mmfig5 ] . in this regime ,",
    "the particle dangles around its actual position , as it occurs for @xmath93 , meaning that its motion is confined mostly to one well .",
    "we note , however , that the amplitude of the intra - well oscillations becomes much larger so that the corresponding velocity fluctuations are also large .",
    "we conclude that the diffusion coefficient is small for cases when the particle performs either locked motion or running motion without back - turns .",
    "all these considerations are accurately encoded and described by the two previously discussed measures , namely , the efficiency ( [ eta ] ) and the pclet number pe in ( [ factors ] ) or in ( [ pe ] ) .",
    "it is found that the optimal regime for the ideal modus operandi of the brownian motor is achieved when both the efficiency and the pclet number become maximal , see in fig .",
    "[ mmfig6 ] .",
    "indeed , in this regime of optimal performance , the particle moves forward steadily , undergoing rare back - turns @xcite , see the case @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ mmfig6 ] .",
    "we next address the dependence on the strength of thermal noise . in fig .",
    "[ mmfig7 ] , we present our numerical results for the noise - assisted , directed transport at a larger temperature , namely for @xmath95 .",
    "the potential barrier height is still rather high in comparison to the thermal energy . in this regime , a so - called current reversal ,",
    "i.e. a change of the transport direction occurs as a function of the driving amplitude .",
    "otherwise , the behavior remains qualitatively the same as for lower noise @xmath96 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient exhibits three maxima and two minima in the corresponding interval of the drive amplitudes",
    ". however , the optimal regime corresponds to the neighborhood of the second minimum of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in contrast , we notice that at lower noise @xmath96 , the optimal regime set in within the neighborhood of the first minimum of @xmath4 .    under higher temperature operating conditions , optimal transport also occurs when both the efficiency @xmath53 and the pclet number @xmath97 are maximal .",
    "in this work , criteria for the optimal transport of an inertial rocked ratchet were established using two characteristic quantifiers : the energetic efficiency ( [ eta ] ) and the pclet number ( [ factors ] ) . adapting the methods of point processes to rocked brownian motors , we expressed the averaged motor velocity and the position - diffusion coefficient by corresponding averages of the point process @xmath98 .",
    "both these measures can be obtained from simulations of the driven langevin dynamics ( [ nlbw ] ) .",
    "the fano factor @xmath66 used in the theory of point processes is related to the pclet number in a simple manner via pe@xmath99 . in our case , it is more convenient to employ the pclet number because in regimes where the average velocity is very small , the pclet number assumes values close to zero , while the fano factor would diverge . from our numerical analysis",
    "it follows that the optimal modus operandi for the inertial brownian motor is obtained when the efficiency @xmath53 and the pclet number assume simultaneously maximal values .",
    "in the present paper we have considered the effective diffusion coefficient , which is defined as d_eff = _ t , where the brackets @xmath44 denote an average over the initial conditions of position and velocity and over all realizations of the thermal noise .",
    "another definition of the diffusion coefficient is given by the formula d = _ t , where @xmath100 . by inspection one",
    "finds d_eff = d if _",
    "t x(t ) x(0 ) = 0 . in our case",
    ", this term vanishes because of the presence of thermal noise and dissipation .",
    "more generally , @xmath101 may increase at most as @xmath102 if the diffusion coefficient @xmath103 as defined in ( [ d2 ] ) is finite .",
    "consequently , for such processes the equation ( [ dif ] ) also holds .    we now show that the diffusion constant @xmath103 is related to the auto - correlation function of the velocity via a green - kubo relation , in spite of the fact that the system is far from equilibrium . for a system with periodic driving",
    ", @xmath103 takes the form d = _ 0^ ds c(s ) , where = _ 0^t d c_as(,s ) denotes the time average of the velocity correlation function @xmath104 over one period @xmath32 of the driving and where c_as(t , s)= v(t ) v(t+s ) _ as = v(t+s ) v(t ) _ as is the nonequilibrium asymptotic velocity - velocity correlation function . in the case of periodic",
    "driving , this function is periodic with respect to the first argument , i.e. , c(t , s ) = c(t+t , s ) . to show the green - kubo relation , we start from the expression @xmath105",
    "from which it follows that x(t ) - x(0 ) = _ 0^t ds v(s ) .",
    "therefore ( [ d2 ] ) takes the form @xmath106 where c(t , s)= v(t ) v(t+s ) .",
    "changing the integration variables @xmath107 and exploiting the symmetry of the correlation function , @xmath108 , one obtains @xmath109 we assume that the diffusion coefficient is finite . therefore the second term in the second line of ( [ dd ] ) tends to zero as @xmath110 , so that @xmath111 for @xmath112 , one splits the second integral into sum over subsequent periods , @xmath113 where @xmath114 the eqs .",
