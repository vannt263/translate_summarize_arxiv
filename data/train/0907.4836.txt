    "the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) is an excellent target for studying young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "it contains a few thousands of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars within @xmath115 arc - minutes ( 2 pc ) of the central trapezium stars ( herbig & terndrup 1986 ; hillenbrand 1997 ; hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) . at a distance ,",
    "450@xmath270 pc , onc is the nearest high - mass star - forming region where one can find very massive stars of @xmath125 solar mass ( @xmath3 ori c ) to sub - solar objects having mass well below the hydrogen burning limit ( hillenbrand 1997 ; lucas & roche 2000 ) . from recent studies",
    ", it appears that formation of stars in the onc started about 10 myr back and , in the beginning , the formation process was very slow .",
    "later , due to large scale contraction in the onc parental cloud , the activity went through a rapid phase of star formation .",
    "the mean age of the onc is about 1 myr , which characterizes an epoch when large fraction of stars were born .",
    "an age spread of 2 myr around this mean age is found by previous researchers ( hillenbrand 1997 ; palla et al . 2005 ; huff & stahler 2006 ; jeffries 2007 ) .",
    "the onc is located in front of a very extended and fully opaque molecular cloud ( a@xmath4 peaks at 80 - 100 mag ) , which makes the background star contamination almost insignificant in the optical region .",
    "this means that except for a few foreground stars , all visible objects can be straight away considered to be cluster members .",
    "very intense radiation pressure and stellar winds of the massive stars have cleared most of the dust from the onc ( odell 2001 ) and that is why about 80% cluster members are subjected to relatively low visual extinction , a@xmath4 ranging from 0.0 to 2.5 mag ( hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "the low - mass onc stars are very strong sources of x ray emission and the median luminosity of these objects is l@xmath5 erg sec@xmath6 ( l@xmath7/l@xmath8 @xmath110@xmath9 ) , which is three orders of magnitude more intense than the solar x - ray luminosity ( flaccomio et al .",
    "recent studies reveal that the x - ray luminosity of low - mass stars increases with the stellar mass and decreases with the age , but it seems to be independent of the rotation period ( flaccomio et al . 2003 ; stassun et al .",
    "2004 ; preibisch et al . 2005 ) .    in the past , for more than one decade",
    ", the onc and the regions close - by ( onc flanking fields ) were photometrically monitored by various researchers with varying degree of sensitivity as well as spatial coverage ( mandel & herbst 1991 ; attridge & herbst 1992 ; eaton et al .",
    "1995 ; choi & herbst 1996 ; stassun et al . 1999 ; herbst et al .",

    "2002 ) . except the long - term observing program of herbst and collaborators of van vleck observatory ( vvo ) and near infra - red ( nir ) survey carried out by carpenter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , other monitoring programs were primarily focused on a single goal and that was to explore the evolution of angular momentum of the stars in the pms phase , by determining the rotation periods from the light curves produced by modulation of light due to hot / cool spots .",
    "we realized that moderate size telescopes equipped with wide field imaging camera can be very effectively used to address a variety of valuable scientific problems related to pms stars . and hence using various observing facilities accessible to our group , since january 2004 we have initiated a long - term monitoring program on the pms stars of the onc .",
    "since this is the first paper on this project , we not only report the results on the identification of new periodic variables but also describe the science drivers , the observation and the data reduction in some more detail . in sect.2",
    "we describe our scientific motivations .",
    "3 describes the selection of the target field and the observations .",
    "the data reduction procedures are described in sect.4 together with the tools used to determine very accurate rotation periods . in sect.5 we present the results on the newly discovered periodic variables . a brief discussion and our plan for the near future are given in sect.6 .",
    "t tauri stars ( tts ) are low - mass pre - main sequence objects and based on the strength of the h@xmath10 line emission they are divided mainly into two sub classes : weak lined tts ( wtts ) and classical tts ( ctts ) .",
    "the periodic photometric variability of wtts is linked with rotational modulation of cool magnetic star - spots .",
    "doppler imaging , which is a robust stellar surface mapping technique , supports the cool spot model ( strassmeier 2002 ; schmidt et al 2005 ; skelly et al .",
    "wtts are found to be relatively fast rotators with the preliminary indication that they do not possess surface differential rotation ( cohen et al .",
    "2004 ; skelly et al .",
    "they are sources of strong non - thermal radio as well as x - ray emission .",
    "since t tauri stars are believed to be fully convective , they can not sustain the so - called @xmath11 interface dynamo .",
    "furthermore , a fossil field can survive only over timescales from 10 to 100 years in a fully convective star .",
    "so , even for few - million - year - old tts , a dynamo process is necessary to generate and amplify the magnetic field .",
    "the mechanism under which fully convective stars succeed to produce magnetism and related activities is a subject of debate ( chabrier & kuker 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the long - term monitoring of low - mass stars of the onc will be very valuable to understand the mechanism responsible for the generation of magnetic field in fully convective very young stars .",
    "we are particularly interested to explore the presence / absence of activity cycles and of surface differential rotation in wtts .",
    "ctts are surrounded by a circum - stellar accretion disk and are characterised by the presence of strong emission lines as well as an excess hot continuum emission . according magnetospheric models ,",
    "strong dipolar field disrupt the inner disk at a few stellar radii .",
    "the disk material is channeled from the inner region of the disk onto the star along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the free falling material eventually hit the stellar surface and develops accretion shocks ( calvet & gullbring 1998 ) .",
    "the thermalized shock energy form hot spots / ring near the magnetic pole which is seen as an excess blue continuum emission in the spectrum of cool ctts and in the optical - band photometry .",
    "the surface magnetic field measured from zeeman broadening in several ctts indeed indicates the presence of very strong magnetic fields with an average field strength of @xmath12.5  kg ( johns - krull 2007 ; bouvier et al .",
    "recent results from the zeeman doppler imaging technique also reveal the presence of large - scale dipolar fields of about 1  kg together with a rather complex field configuration close to the stellar surface ( jardine et al .",
    "2008 ; donati et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the hot spots are supposed to be foot prints on the photosphere of the large scale dipolar field , which facilitates the accretion from the disk . from our long - term multi - band monitoring program",
    "we intend to explore the temporal evolution of the hot spots .",
    "in addition , to obtain the disk accretion rate , we plan to model the ctts light curves using star - spot models ( budding 1977 ; dorren 1987 ; mahdavi & kenyon 1998 ) combined with the mechanism proposed by calvet & gullbring ( 1998 ) to account the excess emission coming from the hot spots .      eclipsing binary systems provide an opportunity to measure stellar masses , radii , effective surface temperature , and luminosity of the individual components with very high precision .",
    "these are the parameters one need to test various theoretical pms evolutionary models .",
    "several monitoring programs on young clusters , conducted recently by different groups have yielded only five such pms eclipsing binaries ( irwin et al .",
    "2007 ; cargile 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the identification of more such systems is indeed in great demand .",
    "it appears that the discovery of just five eclipsing binaries among few thousand of pms stars monitored so far , points toward the presence of some biases .",
    "the first thing we must take into account is that most of the surveys made in the recent past were single observing run , whereas the prominent source of variability in low - mass pms stars are either due to the inhomogeneous distribution of cool / hot spots and/or to the variable disk extinction .",
    "therefore , the shallower light variation due to the eclipses , being superimposed on these strong variations , is likely to be masked and only by means of repeated observations carried out over several seasons one can disentangle these effects .",
    "moreover , all pms eclipsing systems identified so far are algol - type eclipsing variables .",
    "the close semidetached / contact binaries ( if they can form ) and partially eclipsing variables are simply indiscernible from single season light curves , and hence not have been identified so far . therefore , from our continuous multi - year monitoring",
    ", we expect to identify a few more interesting candidates probably missed out by previous surveys .",
    "uxor objects are mostly intermediate - mass pms stars but can also be low - mass pms stars .",
    "the light curves of these stars are characterized by sudden drops in brightness up to 3 mag in the v band , followed by increased reddening and linear polarization ( waters & waelkens 1998 ; grinin et al .",
    "1998 ; herbig 2008 ) . in very deep minima",
    "the star reverses the color variation and , often , becomes bluer again ( bibo & the 1991 ) .",
    "the origin of the brightness drops , the increase in polarization , and the blueing effect have been debated for a long time ( natta et al .",
    "1997 ; bertout 2000 ; dullemond et al .",
    "the model based on variable obscuration suggest two different mechanism : passage of proto - cometary clouds in front of the star ( grady et al .",
    "2000 ) , and/or small hydrodynamic perturbations in the puffed - up inner rim ( dullemond et al .",
    "2003 , pontoppidan et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a very interesting mechanism was proposed by herbst & scevchenko ( 1999 ) , in which unsteady accretion naturally explains several observable phenomena related to uxor . from several h@xmath10 surveys including our own",
    ", we find about one hundred stars surrounded by the active accretion disk in our small fov ( sect.5.1 ) , and it is quite expected that a few of these will indeed turn out to be uxor candidates .",
    "fuor and exor are young low - mass stellar objects surrounded by proto - planetary accretion disk and characterized by sudden enhancement in the luminosity . during eruption",
    ", an fuor star can be become 100 to 1000 times more luminous and , then after it gradually fades up , reaching a quiescence phase . on the other hand , exor phenomenon",
    "is found to be less energetic but shows more frequent / recurrent transient activity .",
    "both fuor and exor phenomena are generally explained in terms of enhancement of disk accretion rate and several mechanisms have been proposed to trigger the outburst .",
    "these include a tidal interaction with a companion star , thermal or gravitational instabilities , and induced accretion due to presence of massive planets ( bonnell & bastien 1992 ; hartmann et al .",
    "2004 ; vorobyov & basu 2005 ; lodato & clarke 2004 ) .",
    "it is also not well understood whether the physical mechanism operating in exor outburst is the same as in fuors and the difference in burst duration as well as the amplitude is a consequence of pms evolution , or some very different physical process is responsible for the exor phenomenon .",
    "there is one already known exor in our field ( v1118 ori ) and we expect to identify a few more exor and fuor objects .",
    "in addition to identifying such a new objects , our multi - band time series data together with the spectroscopic follow - up study will greatly help to understand the mechanism responsible for the uxor , fuor and exor phenomenon .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned science objectives , our program will also be useful to address a few important aspects of the angular momentum evolution in the pms phase .",
    "it is believed that a fraction of low - mass stars surrounded by disks goes through a phase of strong disk - braking , then after the disk - free star freely spins - up .",
    "the disk - braking models combined with the process of star formation ( burst / sequential ) as well disk dispersal , predict the bi - modal distribution of the rotation periods in young stars . however , numerous studies made on this regard over the last decade ended - up with very contradictory claims and counter claims ( stassun et al . 1999 ; herbst et al . 2002 ; rebull 2004 ; lamm et al .",
    "2005 , rebull 2006 ; cieza & baliber 2007 ) . in most studies of stellar angular momentum , the stellar rotation period is obtained from light curves produced by the rotational modulation of the star light due to inhomogeneous cool / hot spots , unevenly distributed on the stellar surface .",
    "however , there have been no attempts made to check the completeness of the rotation periods derived from the light curves of various objects ( except some work done by cohen et al .",
    "2004 on ic348 ; lamm et al . 2005 on ngc2264 ) .",
    "it is well known that the cool spots on wtts and other active stars can change their size as well as spatial distribution so dramatically and rapidly that one can not expect to get always the rotation modulation , specifically when the amplitude of variation is small .",
    "that is the reason , for example , why the single - season survey made by herbst et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in 1998 - 1999 with the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope could not detect all the bright periodic variables identified by the previous survey of stassun et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , despite using a larger telescope and , hence , with better sensitivity and accuracy . on the other hand , stars with disks ( mainly ctts ) are supposed to have both cool and hot spots .",
    "these stars usually display very irregular light variations and , often , it is difficult to get their rotation period accurately , at least from a single observing run ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ; grankin et al .",
    "one of the question we want to address is why just about 10 - 20% of several thousands of low - mass pms stars monitored so far are found to be periodic variables . what happened to the remaining 80 - 90% of stars ?",
    "why do they not show any regular and periodic variation despite having all the ingredients to produce magnetic spots ?",
    "so , our long - term monitoring program hopefully will put us in the position to shed some light on detectability of the rotation periods and the effects of biases preventing their detections .",
    "keeping in mind the science goals mentioned in the preceding section , we started looking for a stellar field associated with very young stellar clusters containing a large number of confirmed and relatively bright young members confined to a small region .",
    "another criterion was that the field must have a large number of already known pms variables , representing to different mechanisms responsible for the light variations .",
    "our search finally ended on the onc , which was already chosen as target by other major monitoring programs , conducted by stassun et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , herbst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , rebull ( 2001 ) , carpenter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and herbst et al .",
    "more importantly , since 1990 hundreds of bright stars of onc have also been continuously monitored by herbst and his collaborators of vvo .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of the telescopes what we planned to use was 10@xmath1210 arc - minutes .",
    "since our program needs long - term monitoring at least in two broad - band filters , and considering the limited availability of the telescope time , we had to further optimize a very potential 10@xmath1210 arc - minutes field having large number of variables along with other measured quantities , such as nir as well as x - ray data .",
    "we identified a region south west of the trapezium stars shown in fig.[onc_dss ] .",
    "the coordinate of the selected onc field is @xmath10(2000.0 ) = 05:35:04.09 , @xmath13(2000.0 ) = @xmath005:29:04.8 .",
    "we deliberately kept the very bright trapezium stars out of the field , so that the strong scattered light and very severe bleeding of the charge should not spoil the ccd frame .",
    "the onc field chosen by us includes 110 periodic variables already known from the literature : 92 from herbst et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) and 38 stars from stassun et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter called s99 ) , where 20 periodic variables are common in both groups .",
    "the cross - correlation of optically - identified stars from hillenbrand ( 1997 ) , with 2mass all sky catalogue of point sources ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) and coup x - ray observation ( getman et al . 2005 ) , revealed that almost all optical stars have nir counterparts and large number of them have x - ray data as well .",
    "most of these objects are low - mass stars and extremely young candidates .",
    "almost one fourth of our fov is so close to trapezium and severely affected by a strong hii region ( see fig.[onc_dss ] ) , whose average background level is several times larger than in the region slightly away from it .",
    "nonetheless , we included this region because it hosts a large number of relatively young low - mass stars ( younger than 1  myr ) and most of them have been found to be source of strong x - ray emission .",
    "furthermore , it also comprises a large number of intermediate - mass stars ( hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "the photometric observations of the onc reported here , were obtained between january 18 , 2004 and april 15 , 2008 , using the 2 m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) and the 2.3 m vainu bappu telescope ( vbt ) .",
    "the himalaya faint object spectrograph ( hfosc ) of hct used in imaging mode uses 2k@xmath122k central region of 2k@xmath124k ccd and covers a field of view of @xmath14 arc - minutes , with a scale of 0.296 arc - sec / pixel .",
    "the @xmath15 ccd mounted at the vbt prime focus covers a slightly larger field ( @xmath1 11@xmath1211 arc - minutes ) with plate scale of 0.65 arc - sec / pixel .",
    "the time series observations were made primarily through bessel i & v broad - band filters .",
    "however , during the most recent observing run ( 2007 - 08 ) we collected time series observations in r band too . the most complete time series data in all observing runs is in i band .",
    "reasons to give more emphasis to i band are : ( i ) the i band minimizes the effect of nebular background and interstellar extinction , as well it maximizes the s / n of red faint stars which constitute the bulk of the cluster population , ( ii ) past monitoring programs were conducted primarily in i band and so the comparison and the use of earlier data is only possible with i band , and finally ( iii ) the effect of the seeing is least in i band , and the effect of color dependent atmospheric extinction , which is difficult to correct , is also minimized . in order to avoid the degradation of seeing at low elevation , effort was also made to obtain photometric observations at low air - mass .",
    "whenever possible , immediately after i band observations , we also tried to collect v & r band data with motivation to get the color curves of at least a few bright and less embedded cluster members . during the observing rus 2004 - 06 ,",
    "whenever telescope time was available , a sequence of 3 - 5 frames in each i and v filters with the exposure time of 60 and 180 seconds were collected . in order to increase the dynamic range as well as the photometric measurement accuracy of faint stars , starting from the most recent observing run ( 2007 - 08 ) we changed the observing strategy .",
    "now , one short exposure is accompanied by 3 - 4 long exposures ( 20 and 90 seconds in i band , 60 and 300 seconds in v and r bands ) . whenever possible , this observing sequence which finally gives one averaged data point was repeated more than once per night . in total",
    "the onc field was observed on 208 nights and collected 1986 frames in r , v and i bands .",
    "a brief log of our observations is given in table  [ obslog ] and the distribution of the nightly observations for all the filters is shown in fig .",
    "[ obsnight ] .",
    "the median seeing in i band for these observations is 1.5 arc - sec ( fwhm ) and , during the course of our observations , it varied from 0.8 to 2.5 arc - sec .",
    "seeing at shorter wavelengths was slightly degraded according to the law of the wavelength dependent seeing ( fhwm@xmath16 ) .    since accurate",
    "flat fielding is of critical importance in differential photometry too , therefore , on every night we tried to collect a large number of evening and morning sufficiently - exposed twilight flats .",
    "since there is no over - scan region in the detector used by us , several bias frames , spread over the night , were collected .",
    "it has been found that even after taking all sorts of precaution to do very accurate flat fielding , small errors of the order of 0.1 to 1.0% remain in the flat field ( primarily due to non - uniform illumination of the flat field and wavelength - dependent differential variation in the quantum efficiency of the pixels ) .",
    "furthermore , our back - illuminated thin ccd chips on both telescopes suffer from high spatial frequency fringing problem .",
    "the combination of these two effects typically limits the achievable photometric accuracy to a few milli - magnitude ( mmag ) depending on the instrument used . in order to minimize these effects",
    ", throughout the observing run , we tried to keep the stars in our fov at the same pixel on ccd chip .",
    "to do this we selected a moderately bright star as a reference star and kept this star at reference pixel just before the closed loop guiding used to begin . during 90% of observations ,",
    "all target objects were kept within the 2 - 3 pixels on the ccd frames .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the color - magnitude diagram ( hr diagram ) is the most reliable and widely used tool to obtain mass , age , and radius of cluster members .",
    "these fundamental stellar parameters are determined by comparing the position of stars on hr diagram with pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of stars with respect to pms isochrones may reflect the star formation history ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "it is also an effective tool to explore the evolution of stellar angular momentum in the pms phase . to construct the hr diagram",
    "we need very accurate measurements of effective temperatures ( colors ) as well as of luminosities ( magnitudes ) of stars .",
    "the precise effective temperature is usually measured from spectroscopy , whereas , the luminosity is obtained from de - reddened as well as bolometric corrected magnitudes .",
    "the spectral coverage and resolution of our slit - less spectra does not allow us to obtain accurate spectral type , and hence as the temperature , or equivalently , the intrinsic color is concern we rely on hillenbrand ( 1997 ) data . on the other hand , much more accurate i and v",
    "band magnitudes are determined from our own long - term observations . the median value determined from the data of all five cycles",

    "[ onc_hri ] .",
    "the a@xmath4 and ( v - i)@xmath17 , which are taken from hillenbrand ( 1997 ) are available for only 50% of our program stars .",
    "therefore , the reddening corrected cmd could be only made for a sub - sample of our data .",
    "we have also over - plotted the zams and various isochrones from siess et al .",
    "the solar metallicity with no convection overshooting was used to compute the zams and the isochrones .",
    "the theoretical effective temperatures and luminosities were converted into ( v@xmath0i ) color and v and i magnitudes by making use of the conversion tables of kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "we found a large number of faint blue objects in the hr diagram lying below the zams . because the reddening vector is almost parallel to zams as well as the isochrones , so even after reddening correction these stars will not fit to any of the isochrones .",
    "hillenbrand ( 1997 ) also found such blue and less - luminous objects and inferred that they may be either heavily veiled ctts and/or stars buried in nebulosity .",
    "strongly veiled stars can become systematically bluer by 1 - 2 mag in ( v@xmath0i ) color",
    ". however , at the same time they should also be strong h@xmath10 emitters , which is indicative of strong active disk accretion , that has not been found except for few objects .",
    "on the other hand , there is a large number of such blue faint stars lying in the intense nebulosity .",
    "since the average color of the onc nebula close to the trapezium is about v@xmath0i=0.11 mag , therefore , it is likely that these stars appear bluer due to nebular contamination .",
    "these two phenomena can not explain all the outliers . moreover , there are a few faint blue non - accreting stars outside the strong nebulosity",
    ". these objects may not be at all stellar objects or they may be ux ori objects , which have been found to be bluer when they become fainter .",
    "most of these faint blue objects were not observed spectroscopically by hillenbrand ( 1997 ) and hence they simply disappear in the reddening corrected cmd .",
    "it also appears from the uncorrected cmd that ctts are more populous in the upper portion of the pms sequence than wtts .",
    "this indicates that accreting ctts are in general younger than wtts .",
    "but any such trend disappears in the reddening corrected cmd . in agreement with earlier studies ,",
    "the mean age of onc appears to be of about 1  myr with an age spread of about 3  myr in the uncorrected cmd . here",
    ", we assume that the reddening vector is almost parallel to the isochrones in the low - mass range and that the reddening correction will not change the relative distribution of the stars .",

    ". only stars having a peak power in the periodogram , larger than 99% confidence level computed according to method b for correlated gaussian noise , were selected as a periodic variables .",
    "( see sect .",
    "4.6.2 ) . in table[tab_results ] we report the information related to only the season in which the rotation period has been determined most precisely .",
    "table[tab_results ] lists the following information : our star identification number ( i d ) which runs from 1 to 346 ; an identification number from hillenbrand ( jw number ) ; the normalized power ( p@xmath23 ) of the highest peak in the scargle power spectrum , and the rotation period together with its uncertainty ( p@xmath18p ) . in the next columns we list the reduced chi - squares ( @xmath19 ) of the light curve computed with respect to the median seasonal magnitude and the average precision ( @xmath20 ) of the time series data computed as described in the sect.4.3 .",
    "then we list the amplitude of the light curves in i band ( @xmath21i ) , which was computed by making the difference between the median values of the upper and lower 15% of magnitude values of the light curve ( see , e.g. , h02 ) . that allows us to prevent overestimation of the amplitude due to possible outliers .",
    "after this , we list the number of total useful observations and the data points after averaging the close observations . in the next three columns of table[tab_results ]",
    "we put the following notes : n1 denotes the season to which the listed period and all the values in the previous columns refer ; n2 denotes the cycles where the same periodicity , approximately within the computed uncertainty , were found ( h stands for h02 and h00 data , s for s99 data , all for all cycles including h02 , h00 & s99 data ) ; n3 indicates whether the star is a new periodic or a previously known periodic variable whose period is in agreement or disagreement with the one determined by stassun ( s ) or herbst ( h ) . then after the position of stars with respect to the nebulosity ( sky ) , the star classification as ctts ( c ) or wtts ( w ) .",
    "finally , the last column denotes the presence ( y ) of another star closer than 6 arc - sec . in fig.[example_lc ] we plot , as an example , the result of our periodogram analysis obtained for one of our targets id=293 which has been identified as periodic variable .        as listed in table[tab_results ] , there is a large number of stars whose rotation period has been detected in all observing seasons including h02 data as well .",
    "the periodogram analysis performed on the whole 5-yr time series allows us to determine the rotation periods with accuracy better than 1% .",
    "although the study of the long - term behaviour of our targets will be the prime subject of a subsequent paper , we show in fig.[target_202 ] the light curves of one of these stars ( id=202 ) , as an example .",
    "this example light curves show two interesting features .",
    "the first is that within the longest observing run ( season 5 ) , the light curve is very smooth and the shape has remained constant over about 5 months .",
    "this indicates that the size as well as the distribution of the spot which modulates the star light remain unchanged .",
    "this behaviour differs from what is observed in ms stars of similar rotation period , whose spot patterns are found to be stable over periods not longer than 1 to 2 months .",
    "however , we stress that this is the case for a limited number of stars in our sample , whereas there is a large number of stars whose rotation period , although detected in cycle 5 data , was not detected when the whole time series data was analysed .",
    "this is likely due to a rapid change of the spot pattern on these stars .",
    "another feature is the change in amplitude , mean light level and migration of the light curve minimum from season to season .",
    "these latter variations may be related to the the presence of surface differential rotation ( sdr ) and argd .",
    "as already mentioned , a part of our onc field has been photometrically monitored since 1990 at van vleck observatory by herbst and collaborators ( see , e.g. , h00 ) , in 1994 by s99 , and in 1998 - 1999 by h02 at the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope .",
    "our analysis allowed us to identify a total of 148 periodic variables : 56 are the periodic stars newly discovered by us , whereas 92 were already known from the mentioned previous surveys ( 24 from herbst and collaborators , 11 stars from s99 , and 57 from both groups ) .",
    "we did not detect any periodicity in 18 stars , of which 2 were previously reported as periodic variables only by s99 ( star 302 and 342 ) and 16 only by herbst and collaborators ( star 3 , 4 , 38 , 39 , 62 , 69 , 94 , 114 , 129 , 152 , 175 , 208 , 302 , 327 , 339 , and 344 ) .",
    "actually , we note that previous surveys could detect the periodicity for 14 out of these 18 stars in only one observation season , hence their classification as a periodic variables can be considred tentative . among the 92 stars with already known rotation period ,",
    "there are 14 stars for which we detect a period different than that previously reported . however , we could understand the origin of the disagreement . for 5 stars ( star 81 , 96 , 135 , 181 , 307 ) , the rotation periods reported by either h02 or s99 are very different from ours . looking at our periodograms of h02 averaged data we found a major power peak at the same period found in multiple seasons in the power spectra of our time series .",
    "however , such peaks have a power slightly smaller than the threshold ( p@xmath24=16.5 ) that they fixed and , therefore , they were not considered in the h02 sample .",
    "indeed , this is an example of the advantage of multi - season with respect to single - season observations to obtain more reliable rotation periods .    for the stars 240 , 254 , 283 , 296 we found a period that is almost doubled from the period reported by h02 or s99 .",
    "this mismatch can be explained by considering that , at that time when these stars were observed , two major spots were located on opposite stellar hemispheres , giving rise to a flux modulation with half the period we found .",
    "the disagreement to 4 stars ( star 44 , 285 , 293 , 303 ) is likely due to the beat phenomenon , ours or the h02 and s99 periods being beats of the true period . for star 274",
    "we found in all seasons two different periods , one in common with h02 & s99 and another different .",
    "we adopted the latter , since it gives less scattered phased light curves .",
    "therefore , we can state that for 92 periodic stars , the results of our period search well conciliate with the results of previous studies .",
    "this point is very important , since it assures that we have been indeed collecting very precise photometric data as well as using a reliable period analysis technique .",
    "in addition to this we get confidence on our new detection of periodic variables and also confirmation of the previous findings .",
    "we have discovered 56 new periodic variables in our very small 10@xmath1210 arc - min fov and hence increased the total number of known periodic variables by almost 50% .",
    "however , we must note that 7 new periodic stars ( identified with an apex a in table[tab_results ] ) were detected as periodic for the first time by us and in only in one season .",
    "we need additional observations to confirm these periodicities , which will be considered at the present as tentative and will not be included in any subsequent analysis or statistics .",
    "for instance , the number of periodic stars whose period is detected in only one season ( @xmath25 ) is similar to the total number of false detections expected in 5 observation seasons by fixing the fap at 1% .",
    "we must consider with great caution also the 2 new periodic stars identified with an apex b in table[tab_results ] , since their period is very close to 1 day .",
    "although , the same period was detected in multiple seasons , with high confidence level and giving smooth light curves , it may be an alias arising from the observation day - night duty cycle .",
    "they also will not be considered in the following analysis .",
    "the complete sample of light curves of our periodic variables are plotted in figs.[curve1]-[curve5 ] . in these figures",
    "we plot only one light curve per star , specifically the details of which has been listed in table[tab_results ] .",
    "there are very few massive early spectral type stars in our fov .",
    "since such objects are saturated , almost all our program stars are low- to very low - mass objects and we treat them as tts . in our fov , till to date , 96 stars are found to show the h@xmath10 line in emission and with very large ew , hence , these stars can be assumed as accreting ctts . whereas , the remaining 242 stars which lack the h@xmath10 emission can be considered as wtts .",
    "these numbers of ctts and wtts should be considered a preliminary estimate , and likely subjected to be changed in the future .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in sect .",
    "a few stars which were reported by previous studies as h@xmath10 emission stars , are found by us with no emission , whereas 13 newly h@xmath10 emitting stars have been identified by us .",
    "thus , it appears that to identify all accreting ctts using h@xmath10 emission as a proxy , more extensive multi - year spectroscopic survey is needed .",
    "moreover , we note that a few stars ( like star 16 , 41 , 297 and 309 ) show an i - band light curve amplitude larger than 0.5 mag , although we have not detected h@xmath10 emission . such large amplitude",
    "most likely arises from the presence of both hot spots and variable extinction by the circum - stellar disk . keeping these numbers distribution of wtts and ctts",
    ", our period search shows that about 72% of ctts are periodic variables .",
    "whereas , the percentage of periodic wtts is about 32% .",
    "our findind is contrary to lamm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , whose results on photometric monitoring of ngc2264 reveal that 85% wtts and 15% ctts are periodic variables .    from our study",
    "it appears that the detection of periodic signal related to rotation is easier in ctts than in wtts .",
    "this is surprising in the sense that , as mentioned previously , it is believed that the variability of ctts is dominated by non - periodic phenomena , which should often prevent the detection of any periodic signal coming from the rotation ( herbst et al .",
    "1994 ; lamm et al .",
    "2004 ) . from the present study",
    ", it appears that the ctts of onc have patterns of surface inhomogeneities which give rise to the flux variations more stable than in wtts and much more than in ms stars of similar period ( see fig.[target_202 ] as one example of stable ctts light curve ) .",
    "the increased ability to detect rotation periods in ctts may be due to the large amplitude of light modulation , a characteristic of ctts .",
    "that compensates to some extent the presence of `` noisy '' non - periodic phenomena , allowing the periodogram analysis to correctly identify the rotation period .",
    "the other possibility is that the number of ctts identified from various h@xmath10 emission surveys has been underestimated , and actual number of h@xmath10 emitting ctts are larger than the total number of 96 what we used for the calculation .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , we have divided our entire fov in three different regions and the number of spatial distribution of total as well as periodic variables are as follows .",
    "there are 59 stars residing in bright nebular region and designated as snb , 98 stars are in partially nebular region ( spn ) , 189 are outside the nebula ( sc ) .",
    "we could determine the rotation period of 27% ( 16/59 ) stars inside the nebula , of 33% ( 33/98 ) partially in the nebula , and of 52% ( 99/189 ) outside the nebula .",
    "as expected , the detection of periodic variables outside nebulosity , where the background light contribution is minimum and the photometric accuracy better , is much higher than inside nebulosity .",
    "another possibility could be the presence of a large number of intermediate mass stars , inside the nebula , which are known for their irregular photometric behaviour .",
    "finally , it was also found from previous studies that low - mass stars inside the trapezium cluster are relatively younger ( hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "hence , it is quite possible that the youthness of these objects make their variability rather irregular .",
    "the part of our fov is very much affected by the presence of strong hii nebular emission and , hence , the background contribution is very high .",
    "in addition to this as mentioned earlier the distribution of the stellar mass as well as age are not uniform in this region , therefore , we attempted to get some information about the spatial distribution of periodic variables . in fig.[onc_period_sdist ]",
    "we plot the spatial distribution of periodic variables over the fov .",
    "the unexpected result what we find is that the detection frequency of the rotation period , i.e. number of seasons on which any object has been identified as periodic , is indistinguishable from inside to outside of the nebula .",
    "this result is surprising because the fact that inside the nebula , the observed magnitudes of stars are subjected to the lower photometric precision , objects are relatively massive and their age relative to the mean cluster age is less .      during cycles 4 and 5 , we dedicated a number of nights to search for very fast rotating periodic variables . in order to make our time series data sensitive to very short - term flux modulations down to about 0.1 days , we monitored the onc field over several full nights .",
    "again , the data collected within one hour were combined and used as one single data point while doing time series analysis .",
    "these more numerous data collected within the same night allowed us to very accurately identify 22 periodic variables with period shorter than about two days , 5 of which were newly identified by us .",
    "we could also identify 2 new variables having periods very close to one day .",
    "these short period variables are reported in this paper because they have been detected in multiple seasons with high confidence level .",
    "however , their period need to be confirmed since they may be alias arising from the observation day - night duty cycle .",
    "the scarcity of very fast rotators ( p@xmath260.9d ) in the magnitude range ( 12@xmath26i@xmath2617 ) explored by our survey supports the s99 finding on short - period variables .",
    "he first noticed that the ultra fast rotators that have been found in the pleiades or in other older clusters are quite absent in the onc , at least in the 12@xmath26i@xmath2617 magnitude range .",
    "this finding is quite expected for the low - mass stars of 1  myr , whose break - up velocity is close to 0.5 days . however , here we like to emphasize that the fastest rotating stars identified by us in our fov show a period about two times longer than s99 . in contrast , after a few myrs , like in ngc2264 , the number of rotators faster than 0.4 days increases rapidly . a very deep photometric monitoring campaign recently carried out by rodriguez - ledesma et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the onc , shows the presence of very fast rotators ( p@xmath270.5d ) among very low mass stars ( vlm ) and sub - stellar objects ( bds ) .",
    "these very fast rotating vlm and bds probably possess different dynamo mechanism , operating in this mass regime and producing magnetic fields of different strength and topology as well ( herbst et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we never detected evidence of periodic variability in 198 out of 346 stars .",
    "we have computed for each season the reduced chi - square ( @xmath19 ) with respect to the seasonal median light level in order to quantify their level of variability .",
    "the @xmath19 of each star is found to vary from season to season .",
    "their mean values vs. the median i magnitude ( top panel ) and vs. our internal i d number ( bottom panel ) are plotted in fig.[chis ] .",
    "the dashed vertical bars connect the minimum and maximum @xmath19 values ever observed .",
    "the red , green and blue colors indicate the target position with respect to the nebula ( inside , partially inside and outside , respectively ) .",
    "filled and open bullets represent periodic and non periodic variables , respectively .    except the stars 230 and 308 , which are the least variable in our sample , all non periodic targets can be classified as variable , having @xmath28 in at least one season .",
    "this is not a surprising finding since all targets are very young stars .",
    "they host numerous phenomena which induce variability in the optical as well as in other bands .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath19 show a spatial dependence : their values monotonically decrease from inside to outside the nebula .",
    "this effect does not depend on the star s brightness , as shown in the top panel of fig.[chis ] , but more likely on mass and age .",
    "as mentioned , a previous study ( hillenbrand 1997 ) shows a concentration of intermediate - mass stars inside the nebula , which are characterized by very irregular and large - amplitude variability .",
    "it is also quite possible that stars inside nebula are younger and , therefore , being more active give rise to a larger - amplitude variability .",
    "the luminosity spread in the color - magnitude diagram for stars having similar color , and hence mass , has been generally associated with the age spread and found to be an effective tool to explore the star formation history in young clusters ( hillenbrand 1997 ; palla & stahler 2000 ; hartman 2001 ) .",
    "however , limited photometric measurement accuracy , intrinsic variability and effect of binarity in the magnitudes can mask the signatures of the initial age spread . the use of the median magnitude from our long - term photometric monitoring of the onc stars has allowed us to construct a cmd much more accurate than in previous studies , mostly based on snapshot observation , and , hence , has allowed us to better asses the presence / absence of any age spread in the onc .",
    "it is quite apparent in the cmd of fig .",
    "[ onc_hri ] that , after reddening correction , both wtts and ctts indeed show a spread in the magnitude at any color , which possibly points toward the presence of an age spread .",
    "however , we can not draw a very firm conclusion on this because of the small size of our sample and possible effects from unrecognized binaries as well as uncertain extinction correction .",
    "the presence / absence of spread in age of young stars has been subject of exploration over the last decade and contradictory claims have been made ( hartman 2001 ; burningham et al .",
    "2005 ; jeffries 2007 ; hillenbrand et al . 2008 and references their in ) .",
    "in near future , we expect to make further progress in our study on this subject by enlarging the size of our sample , identifying the binaries in our fov as well as by a better measurement of the intra - cluster extinction correction .",
    "our multi - epoch observations have allowed us to identify in a very small fov a large number periodic variables ( an additional 50% ) .",
    "these newly identified periodic variables were unidentified mostly by previous surveys carried out over a single observing season .",
    "if we exclude massive stars or stars highly affected by nebulosity , then we found about 44% of stars in our fov to be periodic .",
    "this is indeed a great gain with respect to previous surveys of s99 and h02 who discovered periodic variability only in 11% and 26% , respectively , of stars in our same fov .",
    "here we must keep in mind that the s99 and h00 surveys were carried out with much smaller aperture telescopes , hence on a smaller sample of brighter stars .",
    "we could obtain agreement with previously determined periods in @xmath170% of stars , could explain the disagreement for 16% of periodic stars , whereas did not detect periodicity in the remaining 14% stars common in all these surveys .",
    "our finding , and the results of other ongoing multi - year surveys ( e.g. h00 ) as well , pose a strong warning about the completeness of the periodic variables discovered in young open clusters from single observing run , which is the most common case .",
    "if we extend our finding to other star forming regions photometrically monitored in only one season , we expect that the total number of periodic variables is highly underestimated .",
    "therefore , when deriving any conclusion about the distribution of rotation period and its implication to angular momentum evolution , the sample incompleteness must be seriously taken into account .",
    "our monitoring program together with two previous surveys has yielded 148 periodic variables in a sample of 346 stars detected in our fov . except few stars , which show no definite variability ,",
    "all the other stars were found to be variables , although with no systematic variations , i.e. irregular variables .",
    "it would be interesting to know what makes some stars periodic and others non - periodic .",
    "is the undetected periodicity due to unfavourable inclination of the rotation axis , which does not allow the spot pattern visibility to be modulated ? or , is a very unstable spot pattern the major source of irregular behaviours of these non - periodic variables ?",
    "in addition to these causes , sporadic accretion and extinction due to clumpy inner disk could be the source of irregular variation in the stars classified as a ctts .",
    "we will be addressing all these questions in our forthcoming papers .",
    "five consecutive years of observation of a 10@xmath1210 arc - minutes region of the onc , using moderate size telescopes has allowed us to find several interesting results .",
    "we summarize our results below :    * we identified 13 new stars with moderate to strong h@xmath10 emission , whereas , we did not detect emission in 7 stars , which were reported in the literature as strong h@xmath10 emitters . *",
    "the median multi - band magnitudes obtained from the long - term time series data have allowed us to put stellar members on hr diagrams more accurately than the previous studies . from the comparison with theoretical isochrones",
    ", it appears that the age of onc is 1 - 2 myr with a noticeable spread in the age . *",
    "our multi - year monitoring has allowed us to detect 56 new periodic variables , which increases by 50% the number of known periodic variables in the onc region under study . * from a comparison with previously know periodic variables we found matching periods for 70% variables .",
    "we find disagreement for 16% which can be explained either by period doubling or aliasing . to remaining 14% stars no period variation",
    "was detected .",
    "* we also find the absence of stars with period shorter than 0.9 days in the 1  myr old , brights members ( 12@xmath26i@xmath2617 mag ) of the onc . * despite very high background emission , a large number of periodic variables have been identified inside the nebula .",
    "these stars display a higher level of variability as for as reduced chi - square ( @xmath19 ) is concern . *",
    "our study reveals that about 72% of ctts in our fov are periodic , whereas , percentage of periodic wtts is just 32% .",
    "this indicate that inhomogeneity patterns on the surface of ctts of the onc are much more stable than in wtts . *",
    "all but two stars in our small fov are found to be variable , according to the chi - square criterion .",
    "the observations reported in this paper were obtained using two telescopes of the indian institute of astrophysics ( bangalore , india ) : the 2-m hct of indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) , and the 2.3-m vbt of vainu bappu observatory ( vbo ) in kavalur .",

    "<S> the prime motivations of this project are _ i ) to explore various manifestations of stellar magnetic activity in very young low - mass stars ; _ ii ) to search for new pre - main sequence eclipsing binaries ; and _ iii ) to look for any exor and fuor like transient activities associated with ysos . </S>",
    "<S> since this is the first paper on this program , we give a detailed description of the science drivers , the observation and the data reduction strategies as well . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these , we also present a large number of new periodic variables detected from our first five years of time - series photometric data . </S>",
    "<S> our study reveals that about 72% of ctts in our fov are periodic , whereas , the percentage of periodic wtts is just 32% . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that inhomogeneities patterns on the surface of ctts of the onc stars are much more stable than on wtts . from our multi - year monitoring campaign we found that the photometric surveys based on single - season are incapable of identifying all periodic variables . and </S>",
