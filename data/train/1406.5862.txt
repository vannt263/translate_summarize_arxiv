    "semiconductors are crystalline or amorphous substances with a full valence band and an empty conduction band . both bands are separated by the band gap energy @xmath2 .",
    "electronic charge transport in such systems is possible by fulfilling the following conditions :    1 .",
    "electrons must be emitted from the valence to the conduction band e.g. by thermal emission .",
    "`` intrinsic conduction '' results then from the movement of these negative free electrons and the corresponding positive `` defect electrons '' ( or holes ) in opposite directions , if an electric field is applied .",
    "the conduction rises with temperature @xmath8 and becomes remarkable if the average thermal energy of electrons @xmath9 ( @xmath1025mev at room temperature ) approaches @xmath11 . at",
    "sufficiently high @xmath8 , this condition is fulfilled by every material .",
    "small amounts of suitable impurities can create additional `` dopant levels '' in the otherwise empty band gap .",
    "`` shallow acceptor '' levels are situated close to the bottom of the gap , typically a few 10mev above the valence band .",
    "consequently at room temperature they are filled almost completely by thermal emission , leaving behind holes in the valence band ( @xmath6-type conductivity ) . for `` shallow donors '' close to the top of the gap",
    "the situation is opposite  these levels can emit electrons into the conduction band ( @xmath12-type conductivity ) .",
    "deep acceptors or deep donors , which are situated close to the middle of the energy gap , do not contribute significantly to the electric carrier concentration , and thus to the electric conductivity .",
    "insulators are materials with very large @xmath2 , typically in excess of 3  5ev .",
    "however , this limit is quite arbitrary and turns out to be subject of technical development : substances such as aluminum nitride or even diamond are nowadays usually considered to be semiconductors .",
    "semiconductors with @xmath2 considerably larger than the `` normal '' semiconductors si , ge , or gaas ( see tables [ tab : diamond ] and [ tab : sphalerite ] ) are called wide band gap semiconductors , and are the topic of this article .",
    "in contrast , narrow band gap semiconductors have small @xmath2 of a few 100mev .",
    "faraday revealed already in the 1830s that some substances improve electric conductivity with @xmath8 , which is in contrast to metals .",
    "however it took more than a century until semiconducting ge crystals were grown with the czochralski method @xcite and paved the way to broad technical relevance of semiconductors .",
    "the growth of germanium bulk crystals with high crystalline perfection was a breakthrough , and the origin of today s semiconductor - based electronic industry .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath2 is comparably narrow for germanium , leading to considerably large intrinsic conduction which can not be controlled by @xmath13 junctions , and is the origin of electronic noise .    [",
    "tab : diamond ]    .semiconductors crystals with diamond structure [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     an increasing number of tco and tso compounds were studied during the last decade , some of them can be found in table  [ tab : oxides ] .",
    "@xcite reviewed status and prospects of `` oxide electronics '' , which brought already some remarkable results with technical relevance .",
    "the replacement of sio@xmath4 for mosfet gates by `` high-@xmath14 '' materials enabling larger packing density of circuits is an instructive example : initially experiments focused on well known substances such as batio@xmath5 , but failed because the gates were degrading .",
    "@xcite performed a thermodynamic search for metal oxides that are stable in contact with silicon , which has a high oxygen affinity .",
    "about one decade after their invention that hafnium oxide hfo@xmath4 belongs to the few compounds which might replace sio@xmath4 , this high-@xmath14 material was introduced into the production of devices .",
    "thermodynamic equilibria have to be considered not only for the implementation of oxides into silicon electronics .",
    "also for the bulk or layer growth of oxides redox equilibria play a major role  more than typically for other anions such as nitride or sulfide .",
    "this difference can be explained mainly by the vast number of different metal oxides that exist especially for the subgroup elements , with consequently smaller phase stability fields for each of them . among the 4776 compounds of the factps thermodynamic database @xcite",
    "can be found e.g. for manganese : 4 oxides , 2 sulfides , 2 nitrides ; for copper : 2 oxides , 2 sulfides , 1 nitride ; for titanium : 12 oxides , 5 sulfides , 1 nitride .",
    "if metal oxides with oxidation states @xmath15 and @xmath16 can transform via the redox equilibrium @xmath17 then the gibbs free energy change of this reaction is proportional to @xmath18 $ ] if the fugacity of both oxides can be neglected .",
    "plots @xmath19(t)$ ] are linear and separate predominance fields for the subsequent metal oxides @xcite . in a similar manner the behavior of one or more metals in dependence of several nonmetal fugacities can be calculated and results in predominance diagrams ( @xmath20const . ) with straight phase boundaries .",
    "[ fig : hvpe ] explained by such diagram the hvpe process for gan , and fig .",
    "[ fig : cd - o - s ] shows equilibria between cadmium , oxygen and sulfur for two different temperatures .",
    "[ fig : cd - o - s ]    in modern epitaxial systems heterostructures of almost every composition can be grown and under sufficiently low @xmath8 also nonequilibrium states can be produced because they are metastable .",
    "one should be aware , however , that with time and especially if @xmath8 increases e.g. in an active device , metastable structures might approach equilibrium .",
    "this exactly happened with batio@xmath5 mosfet gates before the introduction of hfo@xmath4 ! from fig .",
    "[ fig : cd - o - s ] one reads that cdo and cds are in equilibrium for a wide @xmath8 range and consequently heterostructures of oxide and sulfide are possible .",
    "this agrees with experimental results @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "for very high fugacities of o@xmath4 and s@xmath4 the sulfate cdso@xmath21 is a stable intermediate phase between oxide and sulfide .",
    "such optional intermediate phase should not be forgotten for other heteroepitaxial systems such as nitride an oxide @xcite .",
    "the observation of no@xmath22 bond signatures by photoelectron spectroscopy of oxidized inn surfaces @xcite could hint on the formation of indium nitrate in(no@xmath5)@xmath5 or nitrite in(no@xmath4)@xmath5 as intermediate phase between inn and in@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "chemical stability considerations play a major role also for the bulk growth of oxide crystals that can be used for substrates .",
    "at least zno , ga@xmath4o@xmath5 , in@xmath4o@xmath5 and sno@xmath4 have in common that a high ( in the case of sno@xmath4 even not accessible ) melting point exceeding @xmath23c is combined with a comparably high @xmath24 that is necessary to avoid decomposition of the meo@xmath22 oxide to metal me and oxygen .",
    "if formed , the free metal would immediately alloy to iridium which is the standard crucible material for oxide crystal growth in this @xmath8 range . because the relevant me  ir systems contain low melting eutectics",
    ", this alloying destroys the crucible .",
    "certainly for zno the broadest variety of methods was published that allow to circumvent the stability problem mentioned above , and these methods are more or less suitable also for other wide band gap semiconducting oxides .",
    "these methods include :    * growth from solutions , either water or ammonia based ( often hydrothermal , ammonothermal conditions )  or from molten salts ( e.g. top seeded solution growth , tssg ) . * growth by physical vapor transport ( pvt , sublimation ) or chemical vapor transport ( cvt ) * growth from the melt either from cold crucibles ( `` skull melting '' ) or from hot iridium crucibles with a `` reactive atmosphere '' .    and where reviewed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "crystal growth methods from the melt , such as czochralski or bridgman , combine chemical purity ( no solvents used ) with high growth rate .",
    "indeed , bulk growth of the most important semiconductors silicon and gallium arsenide is exclusively performed from the melt .",
    "meanwhile also zno @xcite , @xmath3-ga@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite , and in@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite where grown this way .",
    "tin(iv ) oxide sno@xmath4 could not be melt - grown so far : the melting point of this substance is for sure much higher than around the @xmath25c , that are given in several references and databases , cf .",
    "if heated up to this @xmath8-range , the edges of sno@xmath4 powder grains become rounded , and in dta measurements one even can see an endothermal effect that might be mixed up with melting .",
    "studying the phenomena in more detail shows , however , that this claim is wrong and locally different partial evaporation of the material takes place instead .",
    "also heating in pressurized chambers ( @xmath26bar ) beyond @xmath27c did not result in molten sno@xmath4 ingots .",
    "compared to the @xmath28 that results from the thermolysis of carbon dioxide.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ] [ fig : oxides ]    @xcite reported that the partial thermal dissociation of carbon dioxide co@xmath4 @xmath29 co + 0.5o@xmath4 gives the basis for melt crystal growth of oxides in a reactive atmosphere .",
    "the reaction equilibrium shifts to the product side if the temperature is increased",
    ". consequently pure co@xmath4 or ( for somewhat lower oxygen fugacity ) co@xmath4/co mixtures can give such a `` self - adjusting atmosphere '' where @xmath28 meets for all @xmath8 the stability field of the desired oxide .",
    "for the semiconducting oxides mentioned so far , comparable large @xmath28 are required , and fig .",
    "[ fig : oxides ] explains why bulk crystal growth of sno@xmath4 from the melt is so difficult : the required oxygen fugacity is so high , that it can not be produced by co@xmath4 dissociation . such as reported by @xcite ,",
    "not the high melting point itself is the problem , but oxide phase instability becomes an issue if the required oxygen fugacity approaches the @xmath28 line of co@xmath4 , and growth is probably impossible this way if it is beyond the line .    for @xmath3-ga@xmath4o@xmath5 large bulk crystals",
    "( efg grown ribbons , float zone and czochralski boules ) are available and epitaxial techniques ( mocvd , mbe ) are developed .",
    "@xcite reported the production of a metal - semiconductor field - effect transistor ( mesfet ) out of this material , and a high on / off drain current ratio @xmath30 was reached .",
    "the authors claimed that very high breakdown fields around 8mv / cm should be feasible with @xmath3-ga@xmath4o@xmath5 , which is almost as good as diamond ( 1020mv / cm ) and outperforms the current high - power material 4h - sic ( 2.5mv / cm ) and also gan ( 3.3mv / cm ) .",
    "monoclinic @xmath3-ga@xmath4o@xmath5 is the stable modification between the melting point and room temperature , enabling melt growth of bulk crystals . with epitaxial growth on sapphire ( @xmath31-al@xmath4o@xmath5 ) substrates and by alloying , @xmath31-(al ,",
    "ga , in)@xmath4o@xmath5 layers can be grown which allow band gap tuning from 3.8ev to 8.8ev @xcite .",
    "nearly all oxide semiconductors are intrinsic @xmath12-type , which is a result of the strong localization of holes ( if formed by doping or nonstoichiometry ) at the oxide ions and impedimental for the development of devices with @xmath13 junctions .",
    "this is a general problem for all oxide semiconductors which can hardly be overcome completely , but some circumstances such as tetrahedral coordination of oxide ions and some degree of covalency can improve @xmath6-type conductivity @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that delafossite type cualo@xmath4 combines encouraging @xmath6-type conductivity with transparency in visible light .",
    "the carrier density of @xmath32@xmath33 and hall mobility for holes of 10.4@xmath34v@xmath35s@xmath35 was explained by large hybridization of oxygen @xmath36 orbitals with the @xmath37 electrons of the cu@xmath38 closed shell , leading finally to low hole effective mass .",
    "these ideas were the basis of an extended numerical study by @xcite . for 3052 binary and ternary oxides , either minerals or synthesized materials , dft computations with the vienna software package",
    "were performed to identify substances with low hole effective mass and large band gap . as expected , low hole masses are much scarce than low electron masses , but some substances which are so far rarely studied could be promising : k@xmath4sn@xmath4o@xmath5 , ca@xmath21p@xmath4o , tl@xmath21v@xmath4o@xmath39 , pbtio@xmath5 , zros , b@xmath40o , and sb@xmath21cl@xmath4o@xmath41 .",
    "it should be noted that the well known good hole mobility of cu@xmath4o ( which has , however , small @xmath42ev ) and cualo@xmath4 could be reproduced too .     with [ cu]:[al ]",

    "cu - al - o2 ]    copper exists in most compounds as cu@xmath43 , and the untypical low valency cu@xmath38 is directly related to the @xmath6-type conductivity of cualo@xmath4 and cu@xmath4o . in a similar manner",
    ", sno@xmath4 is the `` normal '' tin oxide and @xmath12-conducting , whereas potassium stannate(ii ) k@xmath4sn@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite such as tin(ii ) oxide sno shows hole conductivity @xcite .",
    "it is certainly possible to obtain small quantities of such `` low valency '' oxides , either as epitaxial layers or in the bulk , just by crystallizing them together in an oxygen poor atmosphere .",
    "this was demonstrated by @xcite with millimeter - sized cualo@xmath4 crystal that could be grown from an cu@xmath4o melt flux excess .",
    "here the material was kept several days at the growth temperature beyond @xmath44c and then cooled obviously relatively quickly to room temperature .",
    "already @xcite showed that in air cualo@xmath4 becomes unstable below @xmath45c under partial oxidation to cuo .",
    "the stability diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : cu - al - o2 ] was calculated with @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates that the cu(i ) compound cualo@xmath4 has a stability field between metallic copper for lower , and cuo for higher @xmath24 .",
    "the calculation of such diagrams requires that thermodynamic data such as @xmath46 are available for the intermediate phase , here cualo@xmath4 . but",
    "even if this is not the case , a coarse approximation could be reached if the relevant phase is simply neglected for the equilibrium calculation . then an intermediate phase field `` @xmath31-al@xmath4o@xmath5 + cu@xmath4o '' appears instead at almost the same place  just the upper and lower phase boundaries are shifted ca .",

    "this is because the formation energy al@xmath4o@xmath5",
    "+ cu@xmath4o @xmath47 2cualo@xmath4 is not taken into account .",
    "the major contributions to the gibbs free energy of the system , however , result from the equilibria between the subsequent oxidation states of copper .",
    "hence it is almost sufficient to have @xmath46 date for all relevant element oxides available .",
    "it should be noted that the reliability of this diagram is expected to be satisfactory especially for high oxygen fugacity , because the underlying measurements were performed by @xcite in air or even more oxidizing atmosphere and more recent results are not published .",
    "consequently data below @xmath48kj / mol are extrapolated .",
    "unpublished measurements of the current author indicate , however , that this interpolation is not far from reality .",
    "one can expect that working in a suitable reactive atmosphere will pave the way to bulk crystal growth conditions where the delafossite phase can be kept thermodynamically stable .",
    "the successful story of technical semiconductor applications started in the early 1950s with the first @xmath13 junctions that were made inside czochralski grown germanium single crystals . for electronic applications germanium is nowadays replaced almost completely by silicon .",
    "optoelectronics , mainly based on a@xmath49b@xmath50 compound such as gaas , opened in the 1970s a new field for semiconductors , but arsenides and phosphides which could be grown in that time have a narrow band gap enabling optical emission only from the infrared to the green spectral range .",
    "this is sufficient e.g. for displays , indicators , and optical data transmission , but not for general illumination as the blue spectral range is missing .",
    "the successful growth of several nitrides beginning in the late 1980s , especially the wide band gap semiconductors gan and aln on sapphire substrates , widened the accessible wavelength range into the ultraviolet region .",
    "moreover , white light can now be produced for `` solid state lighting '' , with positive impact on global energy consumption by replacing incandescent light bulbs with light emitting diodes .",
    "the substance palette is extended by different polytypes of silicon carbide , sic , and several oxides , such as zno , @xmath3-ga@xmath4o@xmath5 , and in@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "these wide band gap semiconductors are used as substrates for layer deposition of the more classical semiconductors mentioned above , as well as for active devices .",
    "unfortunately , the still unsatisfactory @xmath6-type conductivity of semiconducting oxides is an issue which hinders the development of devices significantly .",
    "wide band gap semiconductors such as sic , gan , and @xmath3-ga@xmath4o@xmath5 have potential not only for optoelectronics , but also for high power devices .",
    "for the recently reported organic - anorganic substances such as ch@xmath5nh@xmath5pbbr@xmath5 @xcite and ch@xmath5nh@xmath5sni@xmath5 @xcite with perovskite structure band gap tuning is possible by substitution of the halide and/or metal ion .",
    "they were used as absorbers in solar cell structures , enabling power conversion efficiencies greater than 15% .",
