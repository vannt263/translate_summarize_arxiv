    "deep surveys over the past decade have revolutionised our understanding of the high-@xmath4 universe and mapped the history of star formation out to @xmath0  6 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . over the same timescale , the finding that every massive galaxy hosts a central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) with",
    "a mass proportional to that of its spheroid ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) has raised the surprising possibility that the growth of galaxies and their smbhs are concurrent , despite nine orders of magnitude difference in size scale .",
    "the most active sites of star formation at high redshift are identified with ( sub-)millimetre emitting galaxies ( smgs ) , such as those detected in deep scuba surveys ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated star - formation rates of these systems are large enough to form a massive galaxy of @xmath5  @xmath3 in just @xmath2  yrs ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "after intense multi - wavelength follow - up observations it is clear that these smgs are already massive at their average redshift of @xmath0  2 and are sufficiently gas rich to maintain a vigorous level of star formation for a further @xmath6  yrs ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results suggest that smgs pinpoint the formation of local @xmath7 early - type galaxies . given the apparent connection between the growth of galaxies and their black holes , what can be understood about the growth of black holes in smgs ?",
    "using ultra - deep _ chandra _ observations ( the 2  ms _ chandra _ deep field - north survey ) we recently showed that @xmath8  40% ( perhaps all ) of the bright ( @xmath9  mjy ) smg population host heavily obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the energetics of the agn activity was found to be ( typically ) too low to explain the huge bolometric output of these objects , which is almost certainly dominated by star formation ( see also , e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the large agn fraction implies that the smbhs are growing almost continously throughout these periods of vigorous star formation ( i.e. ,  @xmath10  40% duty cycle of smbh fueling ) .",
    "this almost continuous smbh growth suggests that there is an abundance of available fuel , hinting that the accretion may be occuring at , or close to , the eddington limit .",
    "although hypothetical , this picture is in good agreement with direct predictions for the growth of smbhs in smg - like systems ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . under the assumption of eddington - limited accretion we showed that the masses of the smbhs in typical smgs are @xmath11  @xmath3 ( @xcite ) . fig .",
    "1 shows the mass accretion rate for smgs hosting agn activity and a comparison sample of @xmath12 quasars .",
    "utilising deep rest - frame optical  near - ir observations we also directly estimated the stellar masses of these x - ray detected smgs , finding that their eddington - limited smbh masses are @xmath8  12 orders of magnitude below that measured for comparably massive galaxies in the local universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result suggests that either ( 1 ) the growth of the smbh lags that of the host galaxy in smgs , or ( 2 ) the smbhs in smgs are accreting at sub - eddington rates .",
    "the former is in stark contrast with the growth of smbhs estimated for high-@xmath4 quasars and radio galaxies ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) while the latter is in conflict with that predicted by models for the growth of smg - like systems with an abundance of available fuel .",
    "the aim of this brief contribution is to further constrain the properties of the black holes in smgs .",
    "black - hole masses ( @xmath13 ) for a small number of galaxies in the local universe have been directly measured on the basis of the velocity dispersion of stars / gas in the vicinity of the smbh ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "black holes can not be `` weighed '' in the same way at high redshift due to poorer spatial resolution and lower signal - to - noise ratio data . however , the well - established virial black - hole mass estimator , which works on the assumption that the broad - line regions ( blrs ) in agn are virialized , provides an apparently reliable , if indirect , measurement of smbh masses in high-@xmath4 agn ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . using this technique , the masses of smbhs in quasars up to @xmath0  6.4 have been estimated ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the virial black - hole mass estimator is somewhat restrictive for smgs since the majority of the sources are heavily obscured ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "however , the identification of broad h@xmath14 emission from a small number of smgs ( @xcite ) provides the opportunity to estimate smbh masses for a handful of sources so far .",
    "here we use the virial estimator of @xcite , which calculates @xmath13 solely on the properties of the h@xmath14 emission line and reduces potential uncertainties on the luminosity of the agn ( e.g. ,  contaminating emission from the host galaxy or an accretion - related jet ) when compared to other estimators .",
    "2 shows the broad h@xmath14 properties of the four smgs from @xcite with fwhm(h@xmath14)@xmath15  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "these smgs have narrow h@xmath14 emission lines when compared to the quasar population ( @xmath8  2000  km  s@xmath16 vs typically @xmath8  5000  km  s@xmath16 ) which leads to relatively modest smbh masses ( average @xmath17  @xmath3 ) .",
    "can these smbh masses also be considered typical of the overall smg population ?",
    "although we can not directly measure the broad h@xmath14 emission - line properties of the other smgs in our sample , we can _ predict _ their broad h@xmath14 luminosity using the x - ray luminosities from @xcite and the x - ray  h@xmath14 luminosity relationship found by @xcite for low-@xmath4 galaxies with luminosities comparable to those of the smgs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted broad h@xmath14 luminosity for typical smgs is up - to @xmath18  erg  s@xmath16 , consistent with the maximum luminosity of the x - ray detected smgs with broad h@xmath14 emission .",
    "therefore , under the reasonable assumption that the broad h@xmath14 emission line has the same intrinsic width in all smgs but is undetected in most systems due to the presence of dust / gas along the line of site to the blr ( i.e. ,  the unified model of agn ; @xcite ) , the predicted smbh mass range for typical smgs is @xmath19@xmath2  @xmath3 ; see fig .  2 . indeed ,",
    "the masses of the smbhs in typical smgs seem unlikely to be much larger than @xmath20  @xmath3 unless the majority of smgs represent a population distinct from those with detected broad h@xmath14 and have intrinsically broader h@xmath14 emission , an assumption that would fly in the face of current wisdom ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) .    what does this result imply for the relative growth of the smbh and host galaxy in smgs ?",
    "clearly robust masses are required to provide a quantitative answer to this question",
    ". however , given the smbh  spheroid mass ratio in the local universe ( @xmath21 ; e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , so long as smgs have stellar masses @xmath22@xmath23  @xmath3 then the growth of their smbhs are likely to lag that of the host galaxy .",
    "current photometric and dynamical mass estimates suggest that the host galaxies of smgs are of order @xmath5  @xmath3 ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "3 shows the mass accretion rate vs the virial black - hole mass for the two x - ray detected smgs with broad h@xmath14 .",
    "this plot provides a measure of how efficiently the smbhs are growing in smgs . even taking into account the large uncertainties ,",
    "the smgs appear to be accreting at @xmath24% the eddington limit and the average mass accretion rate is comparable to the eddington limit ; the finding that agns with similarly narrow blrs ( such as narrow - line seyfert 1s ; e.g.,@xcite ) are accreting at comparable rates provides tangential support for this result ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "evidently quantitative conclusions can not be drawn from such a small and heterogenus sample , however , these results provide qualitative support for the models that predict that smgs are undergoing a rapid eddington - limited smbh growth phase .",
    "we have shown that the black holes in high-@xmath4 smgs appear to be undergoing almost continous growth throughout periods of intense star formation . using the black - hole virial mass estimator",
    "we predict that typical smgs are likely to host @xmath25@xmath2  @xmath3 black holes which are accreting at , or close to , the eddington limit .",
    "these results provide qualitative support for ( 1 ) the models that predict that smgs are undergoing a rapid eddington - limited smbh growth phase , and ( 2 ) our earlier conclusion that the growth of the smbh lags that of the host galaxy in these massive ultraluminous galaxies .",
    "more detailed analyses of a larger sample of smgs with high signal - to - noise near - ir spectroscopy and/or spectropolarimetry in addition to robust host - galaxy mass estimates will provide a more quantitative test of these conclusions . over the next few years",
    ", the expected 10100pc resolution of alma will also allow the detailed dynamics of the gas within the environment of the feeding smbh to be probed , providing the potential to directly track the influence of the smbh on the dynamics of the gas .",
