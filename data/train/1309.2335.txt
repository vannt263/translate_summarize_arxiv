    "previous formulations of rpes are due to davis and feldkamp @xcite , in terms of the interaction between discrete and continuum states and by berg et al @xcite in the frame of a unified theory of inelastic scattering with the time independent scattering theory including asymptotically the double emission region .",
    "rpes was also reviewed by f. gelmukhanov and h. gren @xcite .",
    "previous rpes calculations have been carried out with semi - empirical methods , using either a band picture @xcite or a charge - transfer cluster model @xcite .    here",
    "we will base our formulation on real space multiple scattering theory , excluding the region of double emission , which was previously treated in a separate work @xcite .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the participator channel .",
    "a strict distinction between such channel and the spectator one is only meaningful in the single particle approach , which is justifiable here as we are mainly interested in effects related to the nature of the dichroism itself or effects related to the specific direction of the photoelectron .",
    "the theoretical description and computational method for rpes within rsms have been described in our previous work on cr(110 )  @xcite . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we shall outline the method here again via a more general green s function formulation . in the following ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 denote many - electron and one - electron states , respectively .",
    "most generally , the photoemission intensity is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the photon energy , @xmath12 the electronic ground state with energy @xmath13 and @xmath14 a final state with an electron in the continuum state @xmath15 and a hole in a valence state @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the transition operator . in the independent particle approximation ( ipa ) ,",
    "the final states are of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote annihilation and creation operators . using the ipa and a one - step model , pendry  @xcite showed that the ( non - resonant )",
    "photocurrent can be written as @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a plane wave with energy @xmath22 as observed at the electron detector .",
    "this wave is propagated into the crystal by the advanced single - particle green s function @xmath23 , such that the total photoelectron final state @xmath24 is a time - reversed leed state .",
    "@xmath25 is the retarded green s function which describes propagation of the electron inside the crystal with initial state energy @xmath26 . in non - resonant conditions @xmath17",
    "is given by the optical ( dipole ) operator @xmath27 .",
    "electron correlation and life time effects may be accounted for in a quasi - particle picture by introducing a complex self - energy in the calculation of @xmath25 and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "for photon energies @xmath28 around a x - ray absorption threshold , a second transition channel opens up which leads to the same pe final state @xmath18 as normal photoemission .",
    "this resonant channel consists of a virtual x - ray absorption process followed by an autoionization ( or `` participator auger '' ) decay .",
    "to lowest order in the autoionization operator @xmath29 the transition operator @xmath17 then becomes  @xcite @xmath30 the sum runs over all intermediate states @xmath31 with energy @xmath32 and lifetime width @xmath33 . here",
    "the relevant states @xmath31 are core - excited absorption final states . in the ipa they are of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes a core- and @xmath36 an unoccupied valence state .",
    "such intermediate states correspond to the initial state rule of x - ray absorption .",
    "relaxation to the core - hole may be accounted for by calculating the orbitals @xmath36 not with ground state but with a screened core - hole potential , which would correspond to the final state rule of x - ray absorption .",
    "putting together eqs([eqgeneral],[eqt ] ) with the ipa states for @xmath12 , @xmath31 and @xmath14 we obtain @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the position representation of the retarded green s function @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is short - hand for @xmath41 .",
    "the matrix elements are given by @xmath42 we introduce the particle green s function @xmath43 defined as the single - particle green s function for complex energy @xmath44 and projected on the space of unoccupied states : @xmath45 with @xmath46 , the sum over @xmath47 can formally be omitted and we get @xmath48 complex - valued single - particle green s functions can be computed efficiently using multiple scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical approach has been implemented in a real space full multiple scattering method .",
    "explicit formulas of the resonant cross - section can be found in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "note however , that the function @xmath49 was not used but the energy integration over @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eqmx ] ) was carried out numerically .",
    "the real space multiple scattering code @xcite is interfaced with self - consistent all electron potentials obtained with the band structure method lmto . in this work on fe(010 ) , the atomic potentials were computed in the local spin density approximation for bulk ferromagnetic fe .",
    "the calculated magnetic moment of 2.26 @xmath51 is in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the dipole and auger matrix elements are calculated using scalar relativistic wave functions . from the latter ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupled @xmath52 core states are build up .",
    "the much weaker spin - orbit coupling of the valence and continuum states has been neglected . for the optical transitions , the dipole approximation in the acceleration form",
    "is used  @xcite , since the length form is not well defined for delocalized state .",
    "the theoretical spectra presented in the next sessions include a lorentzian broadening fwhm of 0.2 ev .",
    "first , we illustrate the resonance mechanism for the case of emission from one single fe atom , and we discuss the energy dependence of the signal , the origin of spin flip transitions and spin polarization . the interstitial potential and the potential for the absorbing fe site are the same as those used in the cluster calculations presented in the following paragraph .",
    "the difference is that all multiple scattering and thus all band structure effects are absent .",
    "this allows to focus on the intra - atomic origin of polarization and spin dependence of the resonant photocurrent . in fig 1",
    "we show the spin and angle resolved direct valence band pes and rpes ( spin resolved arpes and ar - rpes ) cross section for left and right circular polarization , for four photon energies across the @xmath0 edge and the corresponding costant initial state ( cis ) spectra ( @xmath53=680.57 , 681.50 , 683.83 , 693.60 ev ) .",
    "the direction of the incoming beam is chosen to be collinear with the spin magnetic moment ( parallel geometry ) while the electron is emitted in a perpendicular direction .",
    "_ energy dependence .",
    "_ for the first photon energy the decay channel is not yet open , thus only the direct valence band pes can take place ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneatom](a ) ) .",
    "the second photon energy is also in principle below threshold , but because of finite core - hole lifetime @xmath54 , the onset of the opening of the resonant channel can occur at photon energies slightly below such nominal threshold ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneatom](b ) ) . for this photon energy",
    "we observe a destructive interference between the direct and the resonant channel , i.e. the opening of the autoionization path decreases the total emission intensity .",
    "this corresponds to the dip region in the cis spectrum . for the third photon energy , the intensity",
    "is strongly enhanced by the opening of the core hole assisted channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneatom](c ) ) , while far from the resonance the total intensity goes back to the one corresponding to the simple direct valence band pes process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneatom](d ) ) . the cis spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneatom](e ) ) show a fano profile typical of interference processes .",
    "_ spin - flip transitions .",
    "_ the direct valence band signal does not show circular dichroism .",
    "this is expected since for magnetic circular dichroism , spin orbit ( so ) coupling is necessary , but here such coupling is neglected in valence and continuum states .",
    "circular dichroism in the angular distribution ( cdad )  @xcite effects are also absent , as the geometrical set up is not chiral .",
    "the rpes signal , however , shows a large dichroism , which is maximum for the strongest enhancement of the signal and of opposite sign for the two spin channels .",
    "since any band structure effects are absent in this single atom limit , the direct signal displays a single peak of lorentzian shape typical for a @xmath2-wave potential scattering resonance and spin up and spin down peaks separated by the exchange splitting . at resonance",
    "however , a new feature shows up in the spin down channel corresponding to the energy of the peak of the spin up channel ( -2.2 ev ) . as there are ( almost ) no spin down valence states at this energy , this peak in the spin down photocurrent corresponds to spin up initial states .",
    "this means that the spin of the photoelectron is opposite to the one of the final valence hole , and thus it is a spin flip transition .    in a spin flip process ,",
    "the selection rule @xmath55 is lifted , since , due to considerable core so coupling , spin is not a conserved quantity .",
    "the origin of such spin - flip transitions , both in resonant auger and rixs @xcite , has always been at the centre of a debate about whether they take place in the absorption step or in the core - hole decay .",
    "the spin flip transitions observed here are a combined effect of spin - orbit coupling in the @xmath52 core shell and exchange coulomb decay .",
    "it is clear that direct coulomb decay can not give rise to spin - flip transitions , since the matrix element is @xmath56 and so the photoelectron @xmath57 and the valence hole @xmath58 have necessarily the same spin .",
    "however , in exchange decay with matrix element @xmath59 spin - flip can occur for @xmath60 . as the corresponding dipole transition matrix element is @xmath61",
    ", the process also requires a spin flip of the core hole @xmath62 .",
    "this is only possible when the core eigenstates have mixed spin character due to so coupling , which is the case for the @xmath52 @xmath63 states .",
    "_ spin polarization .",
    "_ the peak intensity ratio between up and down spin is about 5:1 at maximum resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneatom](c ) , averaging over the two light polarizations ) while it is only about 3:2 off resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oneatom](a ) )",
    ". so the resonant process leads to a large enhancement of the valence band spin polarization .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "since the spin up band is almost full , core - valence excitation can only happen for spin down electrons .",
    "this means that the large majority of intermediate states are spin down particle - hole excitations @xmath64 .",
    "the autoionization decay of such intermediate states gives rise to both spin up and spin down electrons , but with very different transition probabilities .",
    "spin up photoelectrons @xmath65 can only be produced through direct coulomb decay , whose matrix element is @xmath66 . for spin down electrons",
    "the direct matrix element is @xmath67 and the corresponding transition probability is smaller by a factor @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are the ground state occupation numbers .",
    "this is the same ratio as in the direct ( non - resonant ) photoemission process .",
    "so if there were only direct coulomb decay , resonant and non - resonant photoemission would have the same degree of spin polarization .",
    "the observed resonant enhancement of the spin polarization is due to the exchange decay . from intermediate states of the form @xmath70 , exchange decay produces only spin - down electrons , with matrix element @xmath71 .",
    "the total decay matrix element for spin down photoelectrons is @xmath72 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqmx ] ) .",
    "now @xmath73 is comparable with @xmath74 , since the radial matrix elements are exactly the same when @xmath36 and @xmath16 are both @xmath75 states .",
    "thus the exchange decay strongly reduces the spin down transition amplitude with respect to the direct coulomb decay alone . for spin up photoelectrons , however , no such reduction occurs , because @xmath76 .",
    "this explains why the resonant process produces much more spin up than spin - down electrons .",
    "note that already in our recent study on rpes from cr  @xcite we have argued that a core - valence excitation of one spin channel leads , through autoionization decay , to a majority of photoelectrons with the opposite spin .",
    "it is a crucial element in the explanation why the so - called mixed signal is non - zero even for a non - magnetic ground state .",
    "this issue will be discussed here below , now for the case of a strong ferromagnet .",
    "_ interplay between dichroism and spin - polarization .",
    "_ when using left ( + ) or right ( @xmath77 ) circular polarized light and spin - resolution ( @xmath78,@xmath79 ) of the photoelectrons , there are four independent spectra .",
    "we consider the following `` fundamental '' combinations : +    [ cols=\"<,^,^ , < \" , ]     in fig .  [",
    "fig : check](a ) we plot these fundamental spectra for a single fe atom at maximum resonance .",
    "the set - up is the same as in fig .",
    "1 with light incidence along the magnetization axis ( + z ) and electron emission perpendicular to it ( + y ) .",
    "the dichroic signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : check](a ) is large and negative , which is a direct consequence of the negative circular dichroism in x - ray absorption at the @xmath0 edge , which enters here as the excitation step in the resonant process .",
    "as expected from the direct valence band spectra in fig.1a , the spin polarization changes sign between the majority spin peak at -2.2  ev and the minority spin peak around @xmath80 .",
    "in resonant conditions , the majority spin peak is , however , much more enhanced than the minority peak ( as discussed before ) such that the spin - polarized spectra is dominated by the positive majority peak .",
    "the mixed signal is large and negative .",
    "it closely follows the dichroic signal along the majority peak , but stays negative at the minority peak contrary to the dichroic signal which becomes negligible around @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : check](b ) the magnetization direction is reversed ( @xmath81 ) . as expected from their symmetry under time reversal , both dichroic and spin - polarized spectra change sign , while the mixed signal remains unchanged  @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the mixed signal analyzed in some earlier pioneering studies  @xcite is essentially independent of the orientation of the magnetic moments . in fig .",
    "[ fig : check](c ) we have plotted the average of the spectra in ( a ) and ( b ) , meant as a simple model for a ferromagnet with vanishing macroscopic magnetization due to disordered moments or domain structure . clearly , the spin polarized and dichroic signals vanish , but the mixed signal does not , as found experimentally for ni above the curie temperature  @xcite . in fig .  [",
    "fig : check](d ) we show the fundamental spectra obtained for fe with a non - magnetic ground state , which would correspond to a pauli paramagnetic system . as",
    "exchange - splitting is absent , the spectrum consists of a single broad peak centered around -1.3 ev . for this non - magnetic system and non - chiral set up , the dichroic and spin - polarized signals are obviously zero .",
    "however , the mixed signal is of the same sign and order of magnitude as that found in the ferromagnetic system ( a - c ) .",
    "this shows that the mixed signal is mainly of non - magnetic origin .",
    "we have drawn the same conclusion previously in the case of cr  @xcite , i.e. for a weak antiferromagnet . in that case , the mixed signal was found almost identical for the antiferromagnetic to the paramagnetic ground state  @xcite .",
    "in the present case of the fe atom with large magnetic moment and exchange splitting , the mixed signal clearly changes both in position and amplitude when going from the magnetic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : check]a - c ) to non - magnetic ground state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : check]d ) . qualitatively the same changes are , however , observed for the total spectrum ( tot ) , which means that the mixed signal does not yield more information about the magnetic state of the system than the total ( isotropic ) spectrum .",
    "thus our main conclusion from the cr results is confirmed here for a ferromagnetic system with large moments : the mixed signal is not due to the presence of local magnetic moments , but rather reflects the spin - orbit coupling of the @xmath52 shell , which is `` transferred '' to rpes through to the exchange process of the autoionization decay  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a sensitivity to local magnetic properties above and below the transition temperature has been reported in itinerant ferromagnets by spin unpolarized angle - resolved coincidence detection of the photoelectron and the auger electron in the normal auger decay @xcite .",
    "we now move to the analysis of spin and angle resolved rpes from a fe cluster .",
    "we start from the case of parallel geometry with normal emission for the outgoing electrons , and we discuss the energy dependence of the signal , the sensitivity to electronic states of different spin and orbital sysmmetry and spin flip transitions .     +    the fe(010 ) surface is modeled with a semi - spherical cluster of 184 atoms and the magnetization is assumed in - plane along @xmath82001@xmath83 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs](a ) we show the comparison between the density of states ( dos ) calculated by lmto on bulk ferromagnetic fe and our rsms code for a central atom in the cluster .",
    "the agreement between the dos by lmto and the dos for a central atom in the cluster is very good , showing that the bulk electronic properties are well described by the internal atoms of the cluster .",
    "[ fig : bs](c , d ) show the band structure along the high symmetry lines of the bcc brillouin zone of bulk fe fig .  [",
    "fig : bs](b ) , as calculated with the lmto code .",
    "the reference frame attached to the cluster is such that the @xmath44 axis is defined by the magnetization direction , with the magnetic moment pointing along @xmath84 , the @xmath85 axis is perpendicular to the surface and the @xmath40 axis is still lying on the surface .",
    "in the case of parallel geometry , the light incidence direction is along @xmath84 .    _ energy dependence and mcd_. in this geometry , the mcd in xas is maximum , since it essentially measures the projection of the magnetic moment onto the direction of the light incidence . in fig.4",
    "we show the spin resolved arpes and ar - rpes intensities for the fe(010 ) cluster for left and right circular polarization , again for four photon energies across the @xmath0 edge . in this",
    "geometrical set up , there is no source for additional purely geometric dichroism ( cdad ) , since all the relevant vectors are coplanar ( and along high symmetry directions ) and hence there is no chirality induced solely by the experimental set up .",
    "we again observe a region of deconstructive interference ( fig.4(b ) ) and then a strong enhancement for the third photon energy ( fig.4(c ) ) , which is different for the two spin channels .",
    "the massive enhancement of the signal observed here does not imply strong interference effects : an analysis of the different contributions in the amplitude reveals that , in our case , the enhancement is given essentially by the resonant excitation alone , as was also found in other cases @xcite .    as compared to the single atom spectra in fig.1 ,",
    "the cluster spectra show various new features due to electron scattering ( discussed below in connection with the band structure of the system ) .",
    "however , in the geometry considered here , electron scattering does not seem to act as an additional source of dichroism , since the sign and shape of the dichroic signal is essentially the same as in the single - atom case .    _ sensitivity to orbital symmetry and spin flip transitions_. let s now discuss the sensitivity of the arpes and ar - rpes spectra to electronic states of different orbital symmetry .",
    "we shall first discuss the spin up channel . the flat band along @xmath86-n - p-@xmath86 around -1  ev in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs](d ) gives rise to the strongest peak in the dos as well as in the non resonant photoelectron spectrum at normal emission .",
    "a projection of band states onto atomic orbitals ( not shown ) reveals that the flat band at -1  ev is essentially of @xmath87 character .",
    "the two states at the @xmath86 point , at -0.9 and -2.2 ev , are of pure @xmath87 and @xmath88 character , respectively . from @xmath89 conservation",
    "it follows that for normal emission ( @xmath89=0 ) the initial states lie on the @xmath86-h line .",
    "the peak positions of the spectrum can be found by plotting the final state bands downshifted by the photon energy .",
    "the crossing points give the possible direct optical transitions in bulk fe .",
    "assuming free electron dispersion , we have plotted the shifted final state band for a photon energy of 683.8  ev and normal emission ( @xmath90 ) as a blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs](c , d ) .",
    "the crossing points are close to the @xmath86 point , because for @xmath91(initial)=0 , we have @xmath57(final)@xmath92 and @xmath86 ( h ) points are at even ( odd ) multiples of @xmath93 .",
    "note that since the slope of the final state parabola is very large , a moderate change of the photon energy leads to only a small horizontal shift of the blue line , e.g. by 4% of the @xmath86-h distance for a photon energy change of 10  ev .",
    "it can be seen that the crossing points fit quite well the photoemission peaks around -0.8 and -2.0 ev confirming the band mapping interpretation of the valence band pes .",
    "weak extra peaks ( e.g. at -4.2  ev ) may be due to umklapp processes which can lead to different crossing points on the @xmath86-h line .",
    "it is interesting to note that in off resonance conditions ( fig.4(a ) ) the peak at -2.0  ev which corresponds to an initial state of @xmath88 character , is much weaker than the @xmath87 peak at -0.8  ev .",
    "this can essentially be understood from orbital selection rules . in a reference frame where the surface normal is chosen as the z - axis ,",
    "only @xmath94 final states contribute to normal emission . from angular momentum recoupling coefficients and dipole selection rules it is then straightforward to show that for the dominating @xmath2 to @xmath95 transitions and the chosen light incidence , an initial @xmath87 orbital leads to a three times larger normal emission intensity than a @xmath88 orbital .",
    "this argument , holds , however , only for the direct process , where the valence state symmetry together with the optical dipole selection rule essentially determines the angular distribution of the photoelectrons . for the autoionization process",
    "however , the selection rules are more complex and involve also the symmetry of the core hole and excited state  @xmath47 .",
    "this might explain why at maximum resonance , where the autoionization process completely dominates , the @xmath88 peak at -2.0  ev is no longer suppressed , but of comparable strength as the @xmath87 peak at -0.8  ev ( fig.4(c ) ) .",
    "turning now to the spin down channel , band mapping analysis predicts a single normal emission peak close to @xmath80 ( crossing point in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs](c ) ) . the strongest peak is indeed observed at -0.2  ev .",
    "when going from the non - resonant ( fig.4(a ) ) to the resonant spectrum ( fig.4(c ) ) a new peak appears around -2.3  ev .",
    "this is clearly a spin - flip peak , since its position and shape exactly match the largest peak of the resonant spin up spectrum ( fig.4(c ) , upper panel ) .",
    "this shows that the spin - flip transitions , identified above in the single atom case , must also be expected in ar - rpes from surfaces .",
    "+      we now move to the analysis of the often used @xmath4 or @xmath3 @xmath5 , in which the signal allows to probe directly the core hole polarization @xcite avoiding the contribution of the mcd due to the absorption step ( which vanishes in this set - up ) . here",
    ", we consider rpes at maximum resonance and discuss circular dichroism and spin polarization of the photoelectrons as a function of emission direction .",
    "we analyze two types of perpendicular geometry : the first in which the photon beam direction lies on the surface and the second in which the beam is incoming perpendicular to the surface .",
    "_ perpendicular geometry , normal emission_. in fig .",
    "[ fig : perpgeom](a ) we show the direct and resonant signals for the @xmath0 edge at the maximum of the resonance .",
    "@xmath96 lies on the surface , and in particular it is along @xmath97 , thus perpendicular to the magnetization .",
    "the magnetization is thus perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the signal is spin polarized , as expected , but the amount of spin polarization , i.e. the ratio between the spin up and spin down intensity , is @xmath983 here , and thus it is strongly different with respect to the case of parallel geometry ( where it was @xmath985 ) .",
    "the dichroism , on the other hand , is null .",
    "this is both because in perpendicular geometry mcd in the first absorption step is forbidden and because cdad effects are absent ( it is a completely orthogonal geometry , i.e. , all three relevant vector are orthogonal to each other and the emission is along a high symmetry direction @xcite ) .",
    "the symmetry between the two mirror conditions obtained by reversing the polarization of the light is indeed not broken when the magnetization is perpendicular to the plane of measurement @xcite .",
    "the absence of dichroism in this geometry agrees with predictions from the atomic theory by thole and van der laan .",
    "indeed the geometrical factors @xmath99 in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite vanish when @xmath100 ( which denotes the photoelectron direction ) is perpendicular to @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( which denotes @xmath96 ) .",
    "_ perpendicular geometry , off - normal emission_. most mcd experiments in both rpes and rixs have been carried out in perpendicular geometry with x - rays impinging along the surface normal . in fig .  [",

    "we have analyzed both the cases in which the electron emission direction is coplanar with @xmath101 and the photon direction @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perpgeom]b ) and the case in which it is not ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perpgeom]c ) .",
    "the coplanar case is similar to the one chosen in @xcite .",
    "the electron is emitted at polar angles ( @xmath104,@xmath21)=(150@xmath105,90@xmath105 ) in the fe(010 ) reference frame where the surface normal is at ( 90@xmath105,90@xmath105 ) and @xmath101 at ( 0@xmath105,0@xmath105 ) . since the magnetization , photon incidence and electron emission are coplanar",
    ", there is no influence of cdad in this set up ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) and thus only dichroism induced by the core hole polarization is probed . the amount of spin polarization is strongly reduced with respect to the geometries considered before ( as in the non coplanar case discussed below ) , revealing that emission along non high symmetry directions strongly influences the degree of spin polarization in the photocurrent",
    "however , still the spin up channel is subjected to a relevant enhancement with respect to the spin down channel , the origin of this has been already discussed in section iia .",
    "interestingly , in the coplanar emission case , we observe that , in our approach , the peak related to the @xmath87 is suppressed for the spin up channel , for both light helicities , suggesting that the orbital symmetry of the levels probed by the electron excited in the intermediate state can strongly influence the lineshape . furthermore , as the core hole polarization is also determined by the population in the magnetic sublevels of the @xmath2 band , other ground state moments ( not considered here ) than the spin moment should also be taken into account , as they could play a role in determining the lineshape at the resonance , by contributing in the enhancement or suppression of specific features .    in the non coplanar case",
    "the electron is emitted at ( 150@xmath105,65@xmath105 ) ( fig 5(d ) ) and one has the combined presence of both cdad and dichroism induced by the core hole polarization .",
    "indeed , a non - zero ( albeit weak ) circular dichroism appears even in the direct signal , because of purely geometric ( cdad ) effects .",
    "contrary to what observed before in the case of parallel geometry and normal emission , the dichroism of the rpes signal in the two spin channels for the peak near @xmath80 ( of @xmath87 and @xmath88 character for the spin up and down channel respectively ) is essentially of the same sign .",
    "thus , in the case of a perpendicular geometry and off - normal emission directions , multiple scattering effects can even lead to a sign reversal of the spin polarized mcd signal in correspondance to certain spectral features , as reported in previous works on both core and valence direct photoemission @xcite . as a general trend ,",
    "our results indicate that , when combining perpendicular geometry with off normal emission directions , scattering effects do considerably influence the intensities , the dichroism , and photoelectron spin polarization .",
    "the present method is a fast and simple ab - initio theory of angle - resolved rpes .",
    "as it is the first method of this kind , it contains several assumptions and approximations .",
    "the latter might limit its accuracy and range of applicability and they should therefore be overcome in the future .",
    "first we have limited ourselves to the participator process .",
    "this obviously leads to problems for interpretation of experimental data if the ( raman - like ) participator spectrum can not easily be separated from the ( auger - like ) spectator spectrum .",
    "second , the theory is formulated within the independent particle picture , which implies that it should give best results for weakly correlated systems . for fe , relevant @xmath75 electron correlations and a partial breakdown of the one electron approach have been reported from measurements of unexpected magnetic dichroism in the transverse geometry in normal auger spectroscopy @xcite and from the description of real and imaginary parts of the quasiparticle self energy @xcite . also , it is likely that the resonance enhancement of both the total and spin polarized spectra are somewhat overestimated in the present approach , because both the addition of the spectator channel and of many - body excitations would renormalize the single - particle participator response .",
    "for example core - hole screening leads to an increase of the local valence charge and , generally , to a decrease of the valence spin polarization @xcite .",
    "finally , the same fe bulk potential has been used here for all atoms in the cluster , for simplicity .",
    "this may be easily improved by taking layer - dependent potentials from a self - consitent surface calculation .",
    "thereby the change of local magnetic moment at the surface due to valence bands narrowing could be taked into account @xcite . while this effect is rather small in fe(010 ) , it might be important for other compounds and less dense surfaces .",
    "in summary , we have presented a first - principles method for valence band angle resolved resonant photoelectron spectroscopy ( ar - rpes ) in a real space multiple scattering approach .",
    "we have studied the spin resolved arpes and ar - rpes at the fe @xmath106 resonance , focussing on circular dichroism and spin polarization of the photoelectrons emitted from a fe(010 ) surface in various experimental geometries .",
    "our results fully agree with qualititative predictions that can be gained from general symmetry considerations , atomic models , and the band structure of the system .",
    "while the ar - rpes spectra reflect the band structure in terms of peak positions , the relative peak intensities deviate considerably from non - resonant arpes .",
    "moveover spin flip transitions can lead to new peaks in the spin resolved ar - rpes .",
    "the results on fundamental spectra confirm the conclusion drawn previously in the case of antiferromagnets @xcite , that the so - called mixed signal of combined circular polarized light and spin resolution is essentially unrelated to the existence of local magnetic moments . by comparing different geometries",
    "we have also analyzed the influence of multiple scattering effects on dichroism and spin polarization for emission along high and low - symmetry directions . at present",
    ", our method offers a fast and simple ab - initio theory , which can provide useful information about local properties of low correlated systems , the estimation of the parameters of electron - electron and spin - spin interactions in the resonant decay , and can provide guidelines for future experiments .",

    "<S> a first principles approach , based on the real space multiple scattering green s function method , is presented for spin- and angle - resolved resonant photoemission from magnetic surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> it is applied to the fe(010 ) valence band photoemission excited with circularly polarized x - rays around the fe @xmath0 absorption edge . when the photon energy is swept through the fe @xmath1 resonance , </S>",
    "<S> the valence band spectra are strongly modified in terms of absolute and relative peak intensities , degree of spin - polarization and light polarization dependence . </S>",
    "<S> new peaks in the spin - polarized spectra are identified as spin - flip transitions induced by exchange decay of spin - mixed core - holes . by comparison with single atom and band structure data </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that both intra - atomic and multiple scattering effects strongly influence the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the different features linked to states of different orbital symmetry in the @xmath2 band are differently enhanced by the resonant effect . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance and origin of circular dichroism and spin polarization are analyzed for different geometries of light incidence and electron emission direction , providing guidelines for future experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : :    in the last decade , magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) and spin polarization studies in resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) and resonant photoemission ( rpes ) have acquired great importance in the study of magnetic and correlated materials . </S>",
    "<S> such spectroscopies probe respectively the radiative and non radiative autoionization decay of a core hole , and the signal can be strongly enhanced with respect to the non resonant mode . </S>",
    "<S> the element and orbital selectivity of core level resonant spectroscopies allows to access higher order multipoles which are left unexplored by mcd in x - ray absorption ( xas ) @xcite , to distinguish and enhance specific electronic excitations and satellites @xcite , collective magnetic excitations @xcite , ultrafast and charge transfer dynamics @xcite and to detect quadrupolar transitions towards localized empty states @xcite . in particular , rpes has recently been applied to several correlated materials @xcite and full two dimensional angular scans of resonantly emitted electrons in moderately correlated materials have also been carried out @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these works , together with earlier pioneering studies @xcite on local magnetic properties in macroscopically non magnetic systems , demonstrate the importance of rpes and the need for an advancement in the theoretical description of this spectroscopy , which is the main aim of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> rpes is in principle an autoionization channel of the more general process called resonant auger decay . </S>",
    "<S> depending on whether the core - excited electron participates or not in the auger decay , the process is termed either participator or spectator channel . in the participator channel the one hole final state </S>",
    "<S> is degenerate with the one in direct valence band photoemission ( pes , or arpes if angle resolved ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the two processes generally interfere , giving rise to a typical fano profile @xcite and the emission is often strongly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> this autoionization channel shows linear dispersion of the spectral features with photon energy ( raman regime ) , as direct pes , and it is the one that , strictly speaking , constitutes the rpes . </S>",
    "<S> the spectator channel , on the contrary , leads to an auger - like final state with two holes , and the spectral lines exhibit a normal auger behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> however , often the enhancement of the direct valence band pes is given by the combination of the two different photoemission - like and auger - like channels @xcite and , in order to distinguish between the two regimes , it is in principle necessary to perform measurements with a photon energy bandwidth smaller than the core linewidth .    </S>",
    "<S> exploiting the polarization properties of the light , the angle resolved and spin polarized detection of the decay products can allow in principle to perform highly differential experiments . </S>",
    "<S> several works have been devoted to the study of dichroism in the resonant auger decay ( with focus on the spectator channels ) , in normal auger emission and in rixs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the different excitation conditions in the resonant and normal auger process result in a different degree of polarization for the intermediate core hole ( nearly no polarization in normal auger ) , consequently leading to a different mcd . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental geometry that is often considered is the so called @xmath3 or @xmath4 @xmath5 , in which the photon beam is perpendicular to the magnetization . in this case , the mcd in absorption vanishes and it has been shown that @xmath6 rpes directly displays the quadrupole moment of the core hole @xcite ( the 3d shell is merely a spectator in such decay ) . </S>",
    "<S> decay processes involving open shells , such as core - core - valence and core - valence - valence decays , are more complicated and have not been discussed in such previous works , neither the photoelectron diffraction effects . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , similarly to direct photoemission / auger emission from magnetic surfaces , adding spin resolution to the magnetic dichroism analysis can allow to separate different contributions to the spin polarization ( sp ) of the outgoing electrons @xcite , but understanding the interplay between dichroism and spin polarization in autoionization channels is not straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> while several theoretical formulations have recently been proposed for rixs @xcite , similar theoretical effort is lacking for rpes . at present </S>",
    "<S> , the interpretation of rpes in solids is essentially based on localized models @xcite supported by multiplet calculations , with focus mainly on the spectator channel with well defined two holes final states . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have presented a first principle approach based on real space multiple scattering ( rsms ) @xcite , with explicit calculations for cr , a weak antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> such a method represents a practical computational scheme which allows to consider the band structure of the system , probed by the multiple scattering events felt by the excited electrons .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we reformulate our approach within a green s function formalism and we perform calculations for spin- and angle - resolved direct valence band pes ( spin resolved arpes ) and rpes ( spin resolved ar - rpes ) for fe(010 ) for excitations at the @xmath7 edge by circularly polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : in section i we present the theoretical description of the resonant process via a green s function formalism and we give details about the calculations ; in section iia we discuss single atom results , allowing for a clear explanation of the resonance mechanism , the discrimination of intra - atomic effects in spin - flip transitions and spin polarization effects ; in section iib we move to the full cluster results , investigating the enhancement of the peaks in relation to electronic states of different spin and orbital symmetry , the spin flip transitions , and the effect of multiple scattering effects in different geometrical set up . </S>",
    "<S> improvements to our approach are also discussed . </S>"
