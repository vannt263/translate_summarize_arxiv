    "black holes are one of the most enigmatic constructs in the present day physics . on the one hand , they are the most simple predictions of the general relativity and on the other hand , they are the paradigmatic objects to test possible quantum theories of gravity . to obtain a deeper theoretical understanding of these extreme objects ,",
    "many authors have considered the scattering of coherent waves @xcite .",
    "if the wave length of the incident wave is comparable with the size of the event horizon , then the wave will be diffracted by the black hole .",
    "diffraction effects are responsible for many interesting phenomena in nature , so wave scattering from black holes is an interesting field of its own right , even if observations may not realizable in practice .",
    "a considerable effort has taken place in studying the waves scattered off by black holes .",
    "both numerical and analytical methods in solving the various wave equations in black hole scattering have been developed @xcite .",
    "interest in the absorption of quantum waves by black hole was reignited in the 1970s , following hawking s discovery that black holes can emit , as well as scatter and absorb , radiation @xcite .",
    "hawking showed that the evaporation rate is proportional to the total absorption cross section .",
    "unruh @xcite found the absorption cross section for massive scalar and dirac particles scattered off by small non rotating black holes . in a series of papers",
    "sanchez @xcite considered the scattering and absorption of massless scalar particles by an uncharged , spherically symmetric black hole .",
    "another quantum effect of interest is that event horizons need not be fully absorptive type but can reflect waves falling on it .",
    "it is also proposed that event horizons has a finite energy width .",
    "t hooft @xcite explained the horizon of the black hole as a brick wall so that the outer horizon @xmath1 spreads into a range of @xmath2 .",
    "quantum horizon concepts were introduced by mu - lin yan and hua bai @xcite .",
    "the relevant equation governing a scattering process in a black hole space time is analogous to schrodinger type equations governing scattering phenomena in quantum mechanics .",
    "hence the standard techniques used to study quantum scattering can be used to study scattering problems in black hole space time .",
    "the work of wang et al.@xcite shown that a non extremal rn black hole can not turn into an extremal one by assimilating an in falling charged particle and shell .",
    "so in the present work we are interested in studying the scattering of scalar waves in the rn extremal and sds extremal space - time .",
    "earlier several authors have studied scattering of scalar and fermi fields under different black hole space time and calculated absorption cross sections . in all these calculations the black hole",
    "is assumed to be capable of absorbing the radiation falling on it , but here we consider that both absorption and reflection could take place at the horizon of black holes @xcite .",
    "the absorption cross section , of scalar waves in schwarzschild - de sitter space time , of charged scalar wave in rn space time and of dirac wave in schwarzschild space time were found earlier @xcite . in the present work we use wkb approximation to get the solution of radial wave equation in the vicinity of the horizon of black holes . in section 2",
    "we explain how to obtain the absorption cross section of rn extremal black hole in low energy limit .",
    "section 3 contains a calculation of absorption cross section scalar wave scattered off by sds extremal black hole .",
    "here we take into consider both reflection and absorption properties of the black hole horizon .",
    "section iv concludes the paper .",
    "the rn black hole s ( event and inner ) horizons in terms of the black hole parameters are given by , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively mass and charge of black hole . in extreme case , these two horizons coincide .",
    "i.e , when , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the metric then is given by , @xmath8 klein - gordon equation in a curved space time is , @xmath9 \\phi \\left ( r,\\theta,\\phi , t\\right ) = 0.\\ ] ] thus , the above equation becomes @xmath10 \\phi \\left ( r,\\theta,\\phi , t\\right ) = 0.\\ ] ] writing , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are energy , momentum and its projection , while @xmath15 is a radial function . substituting eq.([d ] ) in eq.([c ] ) we get , @xmath16 to study the scattering problem , we divide the space time outside the black hole into 3 regions @xcite .",
    "we start the three different regions starting from the horizon as shown below .",
    "now we solve the wave equation in the vicinity of horizon , i.e. , as @xmath18 , using the wkb approximation @xmath19 , in eq.([e ] ) and equating the real part we will get the radial wave number @xmath20 from the corresponding equation of motion : therefore , @xmath21",
    "^{\\frac 12}\\frac{r^2 } { \\left ( r - r_0\\right ) ^2 } .\\ ] ] thus near the horizon , i.e , as @xmath22 , @xmath23 therefore , the wave function in the region @xmath24 can be written as , @xmath25    i.e. , @xmath26 let us describe the radial motion with the help of the wave function @xmath27 . using eq.([lm1 ] ) the wave function in the vicinity of horizon can be written , assuming that the wave gets reflected at the horizon and having a reflection coefficient @xmath28 , as @xmath29      this region is considered to be sufficiently away from the horizon , but not very far away from @xmath31 . assuming the terms in energy and momentum in eq.([e ] ) are very small compared to other terms , and considering the s wave case , we will get the equation as , @xmath32 therefore , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the constant of integration .",
    "thus , the wave function will be of the form , @xmath35      here we compare the wave functions in regions 1 and 2 .",
    "eq.([p1 ] ) can be written for s wave as , @xmath36 comparing eq.([q ] ) with the wave function in region 2 given by eq.([m ] ) we will get , @xmath37      this region is very far away from the horizon .",
    "since , @xmath39 is very large , we rewrite terms containing energy and momentum in eq.([e ] ) as , @xmath40 and @xmath41 thus , @xmath42 where @xmath43 . substituting eq.([h1 ] ) in eq.([e ] ) we get , @xmath44 at @xmath45 we get , @xmath46 here the coulomb charge is @xmath47 .",
    "the solution to this equation will be , @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . here",
    "the wave equation can be considered as governed by coulomb problem . introducing regular @xmath52 and singular @xmath53 , solution of coulomb problem",
    ", one can present the wave function as a linear combination : @xmath54 in the asymptotic limit , @xmath55 , the coulomb functions takes the forms , @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , thus eq.([s ] ) will be in the form : @xmath59 but we know that for l=0 @xcite , @xmath60 where , @xmath61 thus eq.([s ] ) for s wave becomes , @xmath62      by neglecting higher powers of @xmath63 eq.([m ] ) can be written as , @xmath64 and using eq.([s1 ] ) , eq.([t ] ) and eq.([r ] ) we get , @xmath65      the two terms in eq.([k ] ) represents the incoming and outgoing waves .",
    "the @xmath66 matrix can be written as the ratio of coefficient of the incoming and outgoing waves ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , therefore , @xmath69 we are here considering low energy absorption cross section for @xmath70 ( s wave ) .",
    "thus from eq.([k ] ) and eq.([s ] ) , we will find coefficients @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 as , @xmath73 using eq.([u ] ) we get,@xmath74 } { 2\\imath pc},\\ ] ] and@xmath75 } { 2\\imath pc}.\\ ] ] thus the s - matrix for the s - wave is given by , @xmath76 where @xmath77 . the absorption cross section in the low energy limit is given by @xcite , @xmath78 taking @xmath79 , we get eq.([x ] ) as , @xmath80",
    "the metric of a sds space time is given by , @xmath81 where @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath85 there exist two positive roots @xmath86 and @xmath87 of @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",
    "the roots @xmath90 with @xmath91 , describes the black hole event horizon , and the root @xmath92 localizes the cosmological event horizon . as @xmath93 approaches its extremal value , i.e , @xmath94 , the position of the black hole horizon @xmath86 monotonically increases and the cosmological horizon @xmath87 decreases to a common value at @xmath95 . here we analyze this extreme case of the sds black hole which is characterized by the condition @xmath96 . in this case",
    "the @xmath88 becomes @xcite ,",
    "@xmath97 applying this in klein gordon equation , we will get , @xmath98 \\psi \\left ( r,\\theta , \\phi , t\\right ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] real part is separated out by , @xmath99 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are energy , momentum and its projection , while @xmath100 is a radial function . substituting eq.([es4 ] ) in eq.([es3 ] ) we get , @xmath101 let us describe the scattering of scalar waves by sds extremal black hole with the help of eq.([es5 ] ) .",
    "we will find solution of the wave equation in different regions outside the horizon .",
    "this is the region very near to the horizon and is the last limit for a wave to reflect from the horizon .",
    "i.e , the wave function @xmath103 in this region ( i.e. , as @xmath104 ) will contain incident and reflected waves . to find @xmath103 we use wkb approximation and write @xmath105 , which will lead to , @xmath106 therefore the wave function in the region",
    "@xmath102 can be written as , @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the wave function in the vicinity of horizon can be written , assuming that the wave gets reflected at the horizon , as @xmath109 where @xmath28 represents the reflection coefficient .",
    "now we consider the second region where @xmath110 . as in section(2.3 ) , here also we neglect the energy and momentum terms in eq.([es5 ] ) and for the s wave the resulting equation will be , @xmath111 i.e , @xmath112 therefore @xmath113      as in section(2.3.1 ) here also we can compare the solution in the regions 1 and 2 .",
    "then eq.([es19 ] ) for s wave , can be written as , @xmath114 comparing eq.([es20])with eq.([es15 ] ) we get , @xmath115      in this region , the terms containing energy and momentum in eq.([es5 ] ) can be simplified as , @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the momentum and is given by @xmath43 .",
    "thus eq.([es5])becomes , @xmath119 since we are considering s wave we take @xmath70 . now at region",
    "@xmath116 we can neglect higher powers of @xmath120 and we get the equation as , @xmath121 since @xmath122 we can approximate the coefficient of @xmath123 as @xmath124",
    ". therefore at large distance we can write the equation as , @xmath125 solution of eq.([es9 ] ) is obtained as a combination of @xmath126 and @xmath127 using frobenius method .",
    "thus solution can be written as , @xmath128 where @xmath129 . here also , as in the previous case ( section(2.3 ) ) , the wave function can be written as a combination of two functions @xmath130 and @xmath131 . therefore @xmath132 but by comparing with the solutions obtained using frobenious method , we know that @xmath133 and @xmath134 . from this",
    "we will deduce that , @xmath135 on the other hand , since @xmath136 is low we can assume @xmath137 and thus , @xmath138 thus eq.([es22 ] ) will become , @xmath139      by neglecting higher powers of @xmath63 eq.([es15 ] ) can also be written as , @xmath140 thus eq.([es24 ] ) has the same form as eq.([es23 ] ) . therefore comparing the coefficients we will get ,",
    "@xmath141      now we will find an expression for absorption cross section of sds extremal black hole . from eq.([es12 ] ) and eq.([es25 ] ) we will get , @xmath142 } { % 2\\imath pc},\\ ] ] and@xmath143 } { % 2\\imath pc}.\\ ] ] s - matrix for the s - wave is given by , @xmath144 } { \\left [ 1+\\mid r\\mid + \\left ( 1-\\mid r\\mid \\right ) \\xi p\\right ] } \\exp \\left ( 2\\imath \\partial _ 0\\right).\\ ] ] it can also be written as , @xmath145 where @xmath146 .",
