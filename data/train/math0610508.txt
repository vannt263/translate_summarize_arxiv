    "this work is concerned with the numerical solution of the time - harmonic maxwell equations discretized by discontinuous galerkin methods on unstructured meshes .",
    "our motivation for using a discontinuous galerkin method is the enhanced flexibility compared to the conforming edge element method @xcite : for instance , dealing with non - conforming meshes is straightforward and the choice of the local approximation space is not constrained .",
    "nonetheless , before taking full advantage of these features , it is required to carefully study the basic ingredients of the method such as the choice of the numerical flux at the interface between neighboring elements . in the context of time - harmonic problems ,",
    "the design of efficient solution strategies for the resulting sparse linear systems is an equally important question .",
    "previous works have shown convergence results for discontinuous galerkin methods applied to the time - harmonic maxwell equations , studied in the form of second - order vector wave equations .",
    "most of these works use a mixed formulation @xcite but discontinuous galerkin methods on the non - mixed formulation have recently been proved to converge ( interior penalty technique @xcite as well as the local discontinuous galerkin method @xcite ) .",
    "the convergence properties of these methods in the time - domain case have been studied in @xcite when using a centered flux and in @xcite when using an upwind flux .",
    "the case of the upwind flux has been analyzed in @xcite and @xcite for the time - harmonic problems and the convergence has been proved only for a perturbed problem . the general case of friedrichs systems and the elliptic maxwell equations in particular has been treated in @xcite and @xcite . however , to our knowledge , no direct convergence analysis on the first - order time - harmonic system   has been conducted so far , which should be useful , for instance , when using an upwind flux ( see subsection [ sec : flux_num ] ) .",
    "the main contribution of this work is a numerical study of the convergence of discontinuous galerkin methods based on centered and upwind fluxes applied to the first - order time - harmonic maxwell system in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : form ] we present the discretization method as well as the different kind of fluxes considered . in section [ sec : convdis ] , the convergence properties are recalled in the case of the elliptic maxwell equations and the solvability of the discrete perturbed problem is analyzed in the case of the centered flux . in section [ sec : res_2d ] the numerical convergence is studied and confronted to the theoretical convergence order .",
    "different numerical fluxes are then compared on two distinct examples .",
    "the system of non - dimensionalized time - harmonic maxwell s equations can be written in the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the unknown electric and magnetic fields and @xmath3 is a known current source . the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the complex - valued relative dielectric permittivity ( integrating the electric conductivity ) and the relative magnetic permeability ; we consider here the case of linear isotropic media .",
    "the angular frequency of the problem is given by @xmath6 .",
    "we solve equations   in a bounded domain @xmath7 , and on its boundary @xmath8 , we impose the following boundary conditions : @xmath9 the vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the components of an incident electromagnetic wave .",
    "we can further rewrite + , assuming @xmath3 equals to 0 , under the following form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the new unknown vector and @xmath14 denoting by @xmath15 the canonical basis of @xmath16 , the matrices @xmath17 with @xmath18 are given by : @xmath19 in the following we denote by @xmath20 the sum @xmath21 and by @xmath22 and @xmath23 its positive and negative parts is the eigenfactorization then @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( resp .",
    "@xmath26 ) only gathers the positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) eigenvalues . ] .",
    "we also define @xmath27 . in order to take into account the boundary conditions , the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "are given by : @xmath30 see @xcite for further details on the derivation of this formulation .",
    "let @xmath31 denote a discretization of the domain @xmath7 into a union of conforming elements ( tetrahedral or hexahedral elements ) @xmath32 we look for the approximate solutions @xmath33 of in @xmath34 where the function space @xmath35 is defined by : @xmath36 ^ 3 \\   /   \\   \\forall k   \\in      { \\mathcal{t}}_h , \\ \\ { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}_{\\lvert k } \\in { \\mathcal{p}}(k ) \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the term @xmath37 denotes a space of polynomial functions on the element @xmath38 .",
    "we take the scalar product of the first equation of ( [ eq:3dformfort ] ) by a sufficiently smooth vector field @xmath39 and we integrate over an element @xmath38 of the mesh @xmath40 : @xmath41 by using green s formula we obtain a weak formulation involving a boundary term .",
    "this term is replaced in discontinuous galerkin methods by a function @xmath42 which is usually referred as the numerical flux ( see also ern and guermond @xcite ) ; the aim is then to determine @xmath43 in @xmath34 such that : @xmath44 in order to couple the element @xmath38 with its neighbors for ensuring the consistency of the discretization , this numerical flux can be defined in the following way : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively denote the set of interior faces , the set of faces on @xmath49 and the set of faces on @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 stands for the incidence matrix between oriented faces and elements whose entries are given by : @xmath52 we also define respectively the jump and the average of @xmath39 on a face @xmath53 shared by two elements @xmath38 and @xmath54 : @xmath55 finally , the matrix @xmath56 allows to penalize the jump of a field or of some components of this given field on the face @xmath53 and the matrix @xmath57 to be defined later insures the asymptotic consistency with the boundary conditions of the continuous problem .      in this study",
    ", we aim at comparing the properties of three classical numerical fluxes :    -   * a centered flux * ( see @xcite for the time - domain equivalent ) . in this case",
    "@xmath58 for all the faces @xmath53 and , for the boundary faces , we use : @xmath59    -   * an upwind flux * ( see @xcite ) . in this case : @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 equals to @xmath64 for homogeneous media .",
    "the definition of @xmath65 for @xmath53 in @xmath47 is identical to the centered case .",
    "-   * a partially penalized upwind flux * ( local discontinuous galerkin method , see @xcite ) .",
    "this flux is characterized by a penalization coefficient given by : @xmath66 the definition of @xmath65 for @xmath53 in @xmath47 is also identical to the centered case .",
    "we are interested in assessing these numerical fluxes for the discretization of .",
    "firstly , we want the best asymptotic convergence order in @xmath67-norm for the electric and magnetic field for a fixed polynomial order approximation on an unstructured mesh . secondly , a minimal numerical dispersion is also needed . in the following",
    "we will focus on the first criterion .",
    "the asymptotic convergence order in @xmath67-norm between the exact solution @xmath68 and the approximate solution @xmath69 corresponds to the largest real coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 such that : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mesh size .",
    "let us note that in the numerical examples proposed in section [ sec : res_2d ] , we will often equivalently consider the evolution of the norm of the error against the square root of the number of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) , in order to deduce coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we first recall in table  [ tab : max_ell ] below the theoretical convergence order for the elliptic maxwell equations @xcite , for a sufficiently smooth solution and when the local function space @xmath37 is @xmath74 ^ 3 $ ] _ i.e. _ the space of vectors whose components are polynomials of order at most @xmath75 . when using the flux with a penalization of @xmath1 , similar convergence results are proved for the time - harmonic maxwell equations in @xcite .        on figure  [ fig : compare_tu ]",
    ", we compare the evolution of the @xmath67-norm of the error with the mesh size @xmath73 by using the meshes @xmath76 , for both a centered flux and an upwind flux , figure  [ fig : competu ] corresponds to the error for the field @xmath1 while figure  [ fig : comphtu ] corresponds to the error for the field @xmath2 .",
    "the results for the upwind flux are the same as for the uniformly refined meshes .",
    "for the centered flux , note the lack of convergence for the case @xmath77 . for all the other cases",
    "the results remain the same as for the uniformly refined meshes .",
    "it is already known for time - domain problems that the centered flux combined to a leap - frog time integration scheme results in a non - dissipative discontinuous galerkin method ( a mandatory feature for long time computations , see @xcite ) . as far as time - harmonic problems are concerned , the previous results show that the upwind flux has better convergence properties .",
    "nevertheless , the centered flux remains less expensive both for time - domain and time - harmonic problems ( arithmetic operations and memory requirements ) .",
    "the domain is the square @xmath78 ^ 2 $ ] where we have suppressed a part by inserting a point of coordinates @xmath79 at it is shown on figure  [ fig : num2_meshes ] .",
    "the properties @xmath80 and @xmath5 are still homogeneous and equal to one.appropriate non - homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced on the boundary of the domain in order to obtain @xmath81 as the solution .",
