    "within the standard model the extraction of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath0 ( and @xmath6 ) is an outstanding topic of @xmath7-meson physics .",
    "several ways have been utilized that are summarized , e.g. , by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "presently , the value of @xmath0 extracted from inclusive decays is somewhat larger than from exclusive decays , e.g. , in @xmath8 .",
    "a fruitful method to extract @xmath0 from exclusive decays is to reparameterize the decay data in such a way that they may be fitted by a smooth ( e.g. , linear ) function @xmath9 of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the 4-momentum transfer . doing so it is possible to extrapolate to the point of zero recoil of the @xmath13-meson , i.e. , @xmath2 , that is not directly measurable .",
    "this procedure is particularly favored in the context of heavy quark expansion ( hqet )  @xcite but also useful to compare to other approaches since in this context the notion of the whole decay spectrum is not needed to extract @xmath0 . in hqet the value of @xmath14 at zero recoil is normalized up to corrections of order @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 denotes the mass of the @xmath17- or @xmath18-quark ) .",
    "however the required fitting and extrapolation procedure leads to some errors , where the statistical error is under control and presently in the order of @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , quark models have been proven very useful as they provide not only predictions for @xmath20 for all @xmath10 and @xmath0 , but also numerous testable results for quite different processes  @xcite .",
    "a general overview on bound state models for heavy hadron decay form factors has been given by ref .",
    "other approaches to the physics of heavy quark has profited from are qcd sum rules  @xcite and lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath20 is known for a quark model one may ask for the implications on the empirical value for @xmath0 , if the zero recoil result is contrasted to the one obtained by using the whole decay spectrum .",
    "both methods are frequently used but not yet compared to each other directly . in addition , relativistic quark models also allow us to describe heavy - to - light transitions , in particular @xmath21 important to determine @xmath6 , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . in this sense",
    "the heavy - to - heavy transitions provide an important test case and bear an impression of possible model uncertainties .    in this context the merit of semileptonic @xmath22 transitions",
    "may be considered twofold : as already mentioned they provide an very good source to extract the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath0 that has to be contrasted to inclusive and nonleptonic decays . on the other hand ,",
    "weak decays ( in general ) provide important complementary information for qcd - motivated modeling of the underlying quark structure of mesons ( in general hadrons ) .",
    "in addition , they may be considered useful to discuss the different relativistic approximations used in this context .",
    "we choose an approach utilizing the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation to treat the @xmath23-system within a relativistically covariant formalism  @xcite .",
    "the model is able to describe the meson mass spectrum for low radial excitations .",
    "it has been applied to the calculation of leptonic decays , viz .",
    "decay constants , @xmath24-decays  @xcite , and to elastic form factors of mesons  @xcite as well as to charmonium and bottomonium  @xcite .",
    "relativistic quark models have been investigated , e.g. , in refs .",
    "the bethe - salpeter approach provides a consistent treatment of two - body bound states as well as the coupling of an external field via the mandelstam formalism  @xcite . in order to actually solve the bound state problem several reasonable approximations are necessary or practical : i ) the quark propagators are assumed to be free propagators irrespective of confinement that is introduced via a confining kernel , ii ) quark masses are assumed to be constant ( i.e. constituent quark mass ) which is reasonable for heavy quarks , since current quark masses and constituent quark masses needed for reproducing the mesonic mass spectrum are rather close to each other , iii ) we utilize ladder approximation for the interaction kernel , and iv ) using an instantaneous interaction in addition leads to computational advantages , as it provides rpa - type equations  @xcite that can be solved by introducing an effective hamiltonian  @xcite in a formally covariant way .",
    "the specific model used here , has been solved for the @xmath23-system in @xcite and applied to a wide range of phenomena  @xcite including the heavy quark sector  @xcite .",
    "details of the model may therefore be found in the references given in the introduction .",
    "here , i give a short survey and summarize some results .    within the approximations given above the @xmath25-integration in the bethe - salpeter ( bs )",

    "<S> * abstract : * in the framework of a relativistic covariant bethe - salpeter model for the quark - antiquark system we present a renewed determination of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath0 . complementing an earlier analysis applied to the whole decay spectrum for @xmath1 we now also employ the `` zero - recoil method '' that uses the end point of the decay spectrum ( @xmath2 ) and is suited for heavy - to - heavy transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged experimental value extracted from the data at zero recoil , @xmath3 , then leads to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is somewhat larger than the one that uses the whole decay spectrum for the model analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we also contrast this result to a nonrelativistic model and to recent experiments on the @xmath5 semileptonic decay .    13.30.ce , 12.39.ki , 12.15.hh , 13.20.he </S>"
