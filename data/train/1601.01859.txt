    "the seminal work of razumov and stroganov @xcite revealed a remarkable combinatorial structure of the periodic heisenberg xxz spin chain with anisotropy @xmath0 .",
    "they investigated the ground state of the hamiltonian for chains of odd length @xmath1 and observed that in a suitable normalisation , many components and scalar products are given by integer sequences in @xmath2 which appear in the enumeration of alternating sign matrices ( asms ) and plane partitions @xcite .",
    "similar connections were found for chains of even length with twisted boundary conditions , as well as for open chains with boundary magnetic fields @xcite . in all these cases , some of the sequences that arise enumerate asms invariant under certain symmetries , such as reflections and rotations .",
    "subsequently , the ground state of the hamiltonian of the dense @xmath3 loop model was also found to involve sequences enumerating asms or symmetry classes thereof @xcite .",
    "a major leap forward in understanding and proving these observations was made by di francesco and zinn - justin @xcite .",
    "their idea was to exploit the connection between one - dimensional quantum systems and two - dimensional models of classical statistical mechanics , specifically the six - vertex model and the dense @xmath3 loop model . by considering inhomogeneous versions of these models",
    ", they reformulated the problem of obtaining the hamiltonian s ground state eigenvector into that of finding a special eigenvector of the inhomogeneous transfer matrix . the powerful tools of quantum integrability make this computation feasible , with the results for the hamiltonian recovered in the homogeneous limit .",
    "this approach led to the rigorous proofs of a large number of properties of the xxz ground states at @xmath0 , namely exact finite - size sum rules @xcite , integral formulas for all components @xcite , as well as exact results for correlation functions @xcite .",
    "higher - spin @xcite and higher - rank systems @xcite were addressed along similar lines , confirming the existence of so - called combinatorial points , namely special values of the anisotropy parameter where the ground states exhibit a relation to combinatorial problems .",
    "in addition to a rich combinatorial structure , the xxz chain at @xmath0 possesses another interesting feature : an exact lattice supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian can be written as the anti - commutator of a nilpotent operator and its adjoint .",
    "the distinctive feature of the above - mentioned xxz ground states is that they are so - called supersymmetry singlets , which play a special role in supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "the coincidence between the connection to combinatorics and the supersymmetric structure is still not well understood , but nonetheless suggests lattice supersymmetry as a heuristic tool to detect combinatorial features of other spin - chain models , for instance at higher spin .    in @xcite , it was shown that , for a one - parameter family of twisted boundary conditions , such a lattice supersymmetry is present for the integrable spin - one xxz chain @xcite , irrespectively of the value taken by the anisotropy parameter .",
    "this suggested some eigenvectors of the spin - chain hamiltonian could again display interesting combinatorial structures .",
    "indeed , for one specific twist , it was observed in @xcite that the hamiltonian possesses a special eigenvector which is also a supersymmetry singlet . in contrast with the spin-@xmath4 chain ,",
    "this occurs _ for chains of any length and for all values of the anisotropy parameter_. in a suitable normalisation , some of its components and certain scalar products were conjectured in @xcite to coincide with polynomials in the anisotropy parameter which are known generating functions appearing in a particular type of weighted enumeration of asms @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional lattice model underlying the spin chain is a nineteen - vertex model built from the fusion of the six - vertex model @xcite .",
    "inspired by the ideas of di francesco and zinn - justin @xcite outlined above , the previous observations were examined in @xcite for the inhomogeneous model and its transfer matrix . applying the formalism of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite ,",
    "a simple eigenvalue was found and the corresponding special eigenvector explicitly constructed using the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "scalar products involving this vector were explicitly computed and found to reproduce partition functions of the six - vertex model , whose homogeneous limits are related to asm enumeration @xcite , thus confirming some observations made in @xcite .",
    "that partition functions of the six - vertex model appear in the nineteen - vertex model comes as a surprise and lacks a more profound understanding .",
    "the present paper continues the study of the combinatorial structures of the integrable spin - one xxz chain and its corresponding nineteen - vertex model .",
    "our objectives are twofold . on the one hand",
    ", we find new sum rules and components of the special eigenvector for the diagonal twisted boundary condition studied in @xcite , and thereby prove some conjectures of @xcite that were still open . on the other hand",
    ", we identify a new anti - diagonal twisted boundary condition for which the transfer matrix also possesses a simple eigenvalue , and find that the corresponding eigenvector has a particularly rich combinatorial structure .",
    "we treat both cases using qism techniques , specifically the algebraic bethe ansatz in the first case and the quantum separation of variables technique @xcite in the second . for both twists ,",
    "we explicitly compute certain components and scalar products of the special eigenvectors in the inhomogeneous case in terms of a variety of six - vertex model partition functions . their homogeneous limit yields generating functions for the enumeration of symmetry classes of asms @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial quantities hidden in the special spin - chain eigenvector are thus readily revealed . as side results ,",
    "we find new determinant and pfaffian expressions for the generating functions of these symmetry classes of asms , extending a calculation by behrend , di francesco and zinn - justin @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in [ sec : spinonexxz ] , we discuss the integrable spin - one xxz chain with particular diagonal and anti - diagonal twisted boundary conditions .",
    "we present our main results for the special eigenvectors of the spin - chain hamiltonian in both cases and their relation to the weighted enumeration of asms . in [ sec : transfermatrices ] , we review the construction of the inhomogeneous nineteen - vertex model via the fusion procedure and its analysis using the qism formalism .",
    "we prove the existence of a simple eigenvalue of the transfer matrices of the vertex models and construct the corresponding eigenvectors . in [ sec : sumrules , sec : specialcomps ] , we compute scalar products and special components in terms of partition functions of a six - vertex model .",
    "we also obtain explicit formulas for the homogeneous limit of the various partition functions .",
    "we present concluding remarks in [ sec : conclusion ] along with an overview of open problems . in [ app : bybe , app : za ] , we respectively discuss some technicalities regarding solutions to the boundary yang - baxter equation and present the derivation of an auxiliary partition function .",
    "in this section , we discuss our motivation , namely the study of the integrable spin - one xxz chain with certain twisted boundary conditions , and present our main results .",
    "the spin - chain hamiltonian has a special eigenvector which we conjecture to be the ground - state for a wide range of the anisotropy parameter .",

    "a number of scalar products and components are given by polynomials in the anisotropy parameter which are known generating functions for the enumeration of symmetry classes of asms .",
    "these results are valid for any system size and any anisotropy .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the well - known spin-@xmath4 xxz chain , where a relation to asms only seems to arise at the combinatorial point @xmath0 .    to obtain the spin - chain results ,",
    "we have investigated the transfer matrix of the corresponding twisted inhomogeneous nineteen - vertex model . using elements of the quantum separation of variables technique ,",
    "we have found a simple eigenvalue of the transfer matrix for the anti - diagonal twist and constructed the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "a similar special eigenvector had previously been obtained for the diagonal twist by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz . with the help of tools from quantum integrability , such as the fusion procedure of @xmath166-matrices , the boundary yang - baxter equation , the algebraic bethe ansatz and the quantum separation of variables method , we have derived exact finite - size sum rules and components for the special vectors .",
    "surprisingly , these can be expressed in terms of partition functions of the six - vertex model on various lattice domains . exploiting bijections between the configurations of the six - vertex model and asms , we have recovered sum rules and components for the spin - chain zero - energy states in terms of combinatorial quantities . as a side result",
    ", we have obtained new determinant and pfaffian formulas for some generating functions of asm enumeration .",
    "the results of this paper lead to several challenging open questions and directions for future work . of central interest is the problem of finding explicit formulas for all components of the inhomogeneous special eigenvectors ( in the canonical basis ) .",
    "there is hope these can be expressed by contour integral formulas , like those obtained in @xcite and @xcite respectively for the spin-@xmath972 and higher - spin vertex models at their combinatorial points .",
    "a systematic computation of all components might elucidate the intriguing appearance of partition functions of the six - vertex model within the nineteen - vertex model .",
    "this feature , which we have encountered many times in this paper as the result of algebraic simplifications , is admittedly poorly understood at the moment .",
    "we expect it could be crucial in understanding whether all components of the special eigenvectors have a combinatorial meaning in the homogeneous limit .",
    "another interesting open problem regards the conjectures about the ground - state eigenvalues of the spin chain presented at the end of [ sec : hamxxz ] .",
    "we expect their proofs to be easier in the subsectors of the hilbert space where the lattice supersymmetry of the integrable spin - one xxz chain is present . in these subsectors ,",
    "the spectrum is automatically non - negative and any zero - energy state is a ground state .",
    "furthermore , the dimension of the space of zero - energy states can be computed using cohomology arguments .",
    "the characterisation of the ground - state eigenvalue in sectors without supersymmetry remains a challenging open problem .",
    "a further avenue for future work is the computation of finite - size correlation functions . for the diagonal twist",
    ", we expect these can be explicitly computed for the inhomogeneous special eigenvector by following the ideas of @xcite .",
    "in particular , emptiness formation probabilities are the easiest correlation functions to study using the formalism of the qism",
    ". the evaluation of their homogeneous limit could be quite challenging but not impossible .",
    "their behaviour as @xmath973 is also of great interest . for the homogeneous nineteen - vertex model and the spin - one xxz chain with @xmath974 , the long - distance behaviour of correlation functions",
    "is expected to be described by an @xmath975 superconformal field theory with central charge @xmath976 @xcite .",
    "the two different twists considered in this paper may correspond to different sectors of the superconformal field theory . to our knowledge , this connection is poorly understood and deserves to be clarified .",
    "finally , we mention two possible directions that venture beyond the integrable spin - one xxz chain .",
    "the first is the extension of our work to the integrable spin - one xyz chain@xcite with twisted boundary conditions , a one - parameter deformation of the xxz case .",
    "its hamiltonian is also supersymmetric in certain subsectors of the hilbert space @xcite .",
    "this allows us to infer the existence of zero - energy states from the xxz case by a cohomology argument @xcite . in a suitable normalisation",
    ", their components can be expressed as polynomials in _ two _ variables whose possible combinatorial content remains to be explored .",
    "the second natural direction to explore is the generalisation of the present work to the integrable xxz chain with arbitrary integer spin .",
    "we expect the fusion procedure will allow us to construct eigenvectors of the inhomogeneous higher - spin transfer matrices using the spin - one results .",
    "this work is supported by the belgian interuniversity attraction poles program p7/18 through the network dygest ( dynamics , geometry and statistical physics ) .",
    "the authors acknowledge hospitality and support from the galileo galilei institute , florence , and from the program `` statistical mechanics , integrability and combinatorics '' , where part of this work was done .",
    "in this appendix , we present solutions to the boundary yang - baxter equation for the six- and the nineteen - vertex model . in its vector form ,-",
    "matrix @xcite .",
    "the matrix and vector form are equivalent . in the latter ,",

    "this equation reads @xmath978 its diagrammatic representation for the nineteen - vertex model is given in the left panel of [ fig : spin.one.ids ] .",
    "for the six - vertex model , the @xmath979-matrix is defined by @xmath980 where @xmath981 is the permutation operator on @xmath171 : @xmath982 .",
    "one can check that latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : solbybe6 }    solves the boundary yang - baxter equation . here",
