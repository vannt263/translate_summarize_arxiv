    "however , most clusters in external galaxies can not be resolved into individual stars , even with the superb resolution of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. consequently , stellar population synthesis has become an important and powerful tool to interpret the nature of extragalactic star clusters , including their ages , metallicities , reddening values and masses . in the past few decades ,",
    "many different simple stellar population ( ssp ) synthesis models have been constructed and applied to study extragalactic star clusters based on photometry in multiple passbands , including @xcite , as well as the galev models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since bss are often luminous and can render the integrated luminosities and colours of their host clusters significantly brighter and bluer , we set out to explore the differences between results derived from application of the bs - ssp models and those derived from other models .",

    "star clusters were long thought of as members of two distinct types , i.e. , open clusters ( ocs ) and globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "ocs are generally young , not very massive , faint , diffuse , and usually located in galactic discs , quite contrary to the nature of gcs , which are mostly old , massive , luminous , centrally concentrated , and usually located in the haloes of their host galaxies .",

    "therefore , it represents an ideal laboratory for studies of statistically significant numbers of globular - like clusters in external galaxies . in addition , since the hubble type and mass of m31 are similar to those of our galaxy , studying m31 s massive cluster system is also important for our understanding of the galactic gc system .",
    "based on _ hst _ wide field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) images , @xcite suggested that there may be @xmath480,000 star clusters in the m31 disc .",

    "we decided to use these bs - ssp models because the ( central ) cluster colours are often affected by the presence of bss , thus causing deviations in ( predominantly ) the @xmath29 and @xmath30 bands with respect to ssp models based solely on single - star evolution @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a two - part power - law imf , similar to both the @xcite and @xcite formalisms .",

    "to avoid discontinuities , following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we linearly interpolated the input metallicities to create a higher - resolution spectral grid containing 100 metallicities ( from @xmath35=-1.7 $ ] to @xmath33 ) and 231 ages from 0.1 gyr to 20 gyr , with equally logarithmically - spaced intervals between the newly created templates .",
    "although @xcite discussed the merits and problems associated with linear interpolation between two points in logarithmic space , which may especially be an issue for sharp ` hooks ' in our isochrones , @xcite and @xcite suggested that interpolation of the model ages and metallicities is feasible and can be done reasonably well .",
    "the galaxev models ( bc03 ) follow the spectral and photometric evolution of ssps for a wide range of stellar metallicities .",
    "the model suite includes 26 ssp models at both high and low resolution , 13 of which were computed using the @xcite imf assuming lower and upper stellar mass cutoffs of @xmath36 and @xmath37 m@xmath13 , respectively .",

    "indeed , bc03 showed that the spectral properties based on a kroupa imf are very similar to those using the chabrier imf .",

    "in fact , to approximate a comparable resolution in age , we reduced the number of time steps to 200 : we kept the model s original time steps for ages @xmath40 gyr and enlarged the time interval to 0.1 gyr for older ages .",
    "the wavelength coverage also spans the range from 91  to 160 @xmath34 m .",
    "similarly , to achieve higher metallicity resolution and avoid discontinuities , we enlarged the spectral grid  which contained 105 metallicities ( from @xmath35=-1.7 $ ] to 0.4 )  by interpolating in logarithmic space , using equally logarithmically - spaced intervals between the newly created templates , as recommended by @xcite .    using fig .",

    "these intrinsic colour and @xmath52 differences will lead to differences in the results predicted by the different models .",
    "in particular , the bs - ssp models are expected to predict intrinsically older ages , higher metallicities and lower masses for the same age , regardless of the reddening affecting the cluster photometry .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that one should be aware that if the ages predicted by bs - ssp models are not sufficiently old , the @xmath53 values derived from the bs - ssp models could be lower than those predicted by other models .",

    "in fact , for the bs - ssp models , 120 of our 445 clusters are older than the _ wmap _ age , while for the bc03 and galev models the equivalent numbers are 55 and 99 , respectively .",
    "the fitting procedure outlined above allows us to obtain the basic parameters of our sample clusters , i.e. , their ages , metallicities , masses and reddening values .",
    "therefore , we can now compare the fit results derived based on adoption of different models and different imfs .      to investigate the differences caused by adopting free versus fixed reddening , we collected data for 310 clusters with reddening values from @xcite and @xcite , and performed free- and fixed - reddening fits .",
    "we also wanted to check whether the free - reddening method could lead to degeneracies in our simultaneous age , metallicity and mass determinations .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows comparisons of the extinction values , ages , metallicities and masses based on adoption of the bs - ssp models with reddening values from the literature , and those resulting from leaving reddening as a free parameter",
    ". approximately half of the newly derived reddening values are systematically larger than the corresponding literature values . similarly , half of the redetermined ages are in good mutual agreement for @xmath81 , which indicates that the method based on leaving reddening as a free parameter may lead to a partial degeneracy in the resulting ages , since addition of nir photometry could not break the degeneracy completely . as for the equivalent metallicity comparison ,",
    "most of our results agree with one another , irrespective of the fitting method used , except that some metallicities derived from the free - reddening method are much lower than those derived based on adoption of metallicities determined previously in the literature .",
    "these results may indeed suffer from the age ",
    "metallicity  extinction degeneracy . on the other hand ,",
    "the masses derived from both methods are in excellent mutual agreement in almost all cases .",
    "we also calculated the offsets and 1@xmath28 errors of the parameters derived from the free- and fixed - reddening fits : @xmath82 mag , @xmath83 [ yr ] , @xmath84}_{\\rm    free}-{\\rm [ fe / h]}_{\\rm fixed } \\rangle=-0.133\\pm0.489 $ ] dex and @xmath85 . the systematic differences between the free- and fixed - reddening fits is consistent with zero for all parameters .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a similar comparison as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , but for the galev ssp models . in this case",
    ", the reddening values derived from the free fits , as well as the age estimates , agree better with the literature values than in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , while the quality and mutual agreement of the mass fits is similar as in fig .",
    ". however , the metallicity values derived from the free - reddening method are systematically higher than those based on fits assuming reddening values taken from the literature .",
    "we thus conclude that the age  metallicity ",
    "extinction degeneracy affecting the galev models is weaker than that for the bs - ssp models , but the age  metallicity",
    " extinction degeneracy seems worse in this case than that shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "again , we calculated the offsets and 1@xmath28 uncertainties for the parameters derived from the free- and fixed - reddening fits : @xmath86 mag , @xmath87 [ yr ] , @xmath84}_{\\rm free}-{\\rm    [ fe / h]}_{\\rm fixed } \\rangle=0.122\\pm0.497 $ ] dex , and @xmath88 .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , also note that the systematic differences between the free- and fixed - reddening fits are consistent with zero for all parameters .        using figs [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , we investigated the extent of the age  metallicity degeneracy for the free - reddening results .",
    "as in @xcite , we conclude that there are no significant offsets between the fixed- and free - reddening results for any of the basic cluster parameters .",
    "therefore , the free - reddening results for the 310 star clusters with reddening values from the literature will no longer be used in the remainder of this paper .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows comparisons of the ages , metallicities , reddening values and masses derived from the bs - ssp and bc03 models .",
    "the filled data points with error bars in the bottom panels represent the mean values for each bin .",
    "each case yields different results owing to the different input ssp models and different imfs used .",
    "note that the ages based on the bs - ssp model fits are systematically older ( by @xmath40.3 dex ) than those derived from the bc03 models .",
    "the results from the bs - ssp models yield higher metallicity , larger reddening and more massive clusters than those derived from the bc03 models .",
    "since the bs - ssp models implicitly assume that bss will affect the integrated colours , the clusters appear to be younger and more metal poor .",
    "thus , the colours predicted by the bs - ssp models are systematically bluer than those resulting from the bc03 model suite for the same age and metallicity .",
    "therefore , it is easy to understand that the reddening values derived from the bs - ssp models are systematically larger than those derived from bc03 .",
    "in addition , the bs - ssp models lead to older ages and higher metallicities .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we note that most of the outliers are found above the locus of equality , which may be caused by relatively large numbers of bss in those clusters .",
    "the small number of outliers below the line of equality may be partially caused by degeneracies in the fits .",
    "table  [ t1.tab ] presents the systematic differences in the ages , metallicities and masses derived from the bs - ssp , galev and bc03 ssp models .",
    "the errors listed in the table are the errors associated with the offsets .",
    "they are defined as @xmath89 , where @xmath28 is the standard deviation and @xmath90 the number of data points .",
    "note that the reddening fits between the bs - ssp and bc03 models are consistent with one another , i.e. , we do not find any systematic differences between the reddening values derived from adoption of these models .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig11 ] shows the resulting metallicity distributions based on the different ssp models for a bin size of 0.1 dex .",
    "although the upper and lower limits of the metallicity distributions vary for the different models , the distributions are different overall and they do not exhibit any significant peaks .",
    "table  [ t2.tab ] lists the mean values of the metallicity distributions .",
    "we find that the choice of imf does not significantly affect the results ; the average value resulting from adoption of the galev models represents the lowest metallicity while that of the bs - ssp models yields the highest metallicity .",
    "the galev models result in a much higher fraction of metal - poor ( @xmath35 < -1.5 $ ] ) populations compared to both the bs - ssp and bc03 models .",
    "since the lower limit in metallicity is much lower in the bc03 model suite , the corresponding distribution extends to lower metallicities .",
    "a significant body of recent work focuses on the mass distribution of the m31 star clusters ( for recent publications see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath52 values can be obtained from the models as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "we calculated the @xmath53 values using both the bs - ssp and galev ssp models , luminosities based on conversion of the @xmath21-band fluxes , and an m31 distance modulus of @xmath91 mag @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the mass distributions of the m31 star clusters in our sample derived using the bs - ssp , galev and bc03 models ( bin size : 0.2 dex ) . for each model",
    ", the mass ranges from @xmath92 to @xmath93 dex in units of log(m@xmath13 ) .",
    "in addition , for comparison we also plot the mass distributions of the galactic gcs based on the data of @xcite ( 2010 edition ; see http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/@xmath4harris/mwgc.dat ) , assuming an age of 13 gyr ( but we remind the reader that @xmath52 values are insensitive to age differences for such old ages ) .",
    "the models applied are the same as those used for the m31 star clusters .",
    "we find that the mass distributions of the m31 star clusters and the galactic gcs are very similar , irrespective of imf choice .",
    "note that all mass distributions have similar peak values , from @xmath94 to 5.5 , which agrees very well with the universal gc mass function , i.e. , a gaussian function with a mean of @xmath955.3 and a @xmath78 standard deviation of @xmath960.6 , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "our cluster sample as well as the optical broad - band and nir photometry used were taken from @xcite .",

    "we found that the bs - corrected models exhibit offsets towards bluer colours for all colours , although these offsets tend to become negligible for ages @xmath46 gyr .",
    "however , note that the galev models show much redder colours in @xmath47 and @xmath48 for ages @xmath46 gyr , which may affect age estimates for young stellar populations .",
    "the galev and bc03 models predict similar colours in @xmath49 , @xmath22 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , while both models exhibit significant offsets in @xmath47 and @xmath48 , especially for young ages .",
    "the bs - ssp models predict the bluest colours while the galev models predict the reddest colours .",
    "we also found that the galev models predict the highest @xmath52s , while the bs - ssp models predict the lowest values .",
    "in addition , the differences become larger for older ages .",
    "our comparisons show that a reasonable choice of imf does not affect the results significantly and that the main differences in the results are caused by intrinsic differences among the ssp models .",
