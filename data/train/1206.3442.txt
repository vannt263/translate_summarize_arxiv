    "development of analog read - out chips for low threshold operation    different pixel concepts for inner and outer layers of future tracking detectors are currently under investigation . + extreme radiation hardness is necessary for the application of detectors in the inner layers of an experiment .",
    "this can be achieved by the application of a very thin sensor material which reduces the effects of the radiation damage .",
