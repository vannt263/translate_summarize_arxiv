    "another choice of filter is the use of @xmath13 weighting , as discussed in section [ s ] .",
    "the @xmath6 statistic calculation neglecting @xmath13 weighting results in higher @xmath6 values for circle pair comparisons at all angular radii , raises the false positive level , and degrades significant peaks .",

    "it can be seen that the search without @xmath13 weighting emphasizes large angular scales , and thus only finds matching circles with @xmath30 .",
    "several recent papers  @xcite have called into question the efficacy of the matched circle test . in each instance",

    "another technique for probing below the limit of @xmath22 circle pairs is employing a directed search for a specific topology .",
    "such a search can increase the @xmath6 value for small circles by stringing together several sets of circles in an expected configuration to create an effectively larger radius circle with the increased number of pixels . for a cubic 3-torus universe , for example , we expect to find at least three sets of circle pairs corresponding to the matching faces of the fundamental domain and we can predict the relative orientations of each matching set .    the combination search for this example would consist of choosing a circle center and circle radius and comparing the pixels around this circle to the circle exactly opposite it in the sky .",

    "it is crucial to calculate the false positive line correctly for the combination search .",
    "while the combination statistic lowers the false positive level for small circles by creating effectively larger circles , it must be remembered that the combination statistic requires a larger search than looking for back - to - back circles .",
