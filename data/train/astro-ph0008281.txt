    "recent applications of the apparent magnitude versus redshift test based on type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have resulted in interesting constraints on cosmological - model parameters ( see , e.g. , riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; podariu & ratra 2000 ; waga & frieman 2000 ; gott et al . 2001 ) .",

    "a dedicated supernova space telescope could provide the high quality data needed to realize the full potential of this neoclassical cosmological test .    in this paper",
    "we examine constraints on cosmological - model parameters that will result from such a data set .",
    "for definiteness we focus on data that could be acquired by the proposed snap space telescope ( curtis et al .",
    "2000 and http://snap.lbl.gov ) .",
    "that is , we assume a data set of 2000 sne  ia multi - frequency light curves , for sne out to redshift @xmath3 , with errors discussed below .",
    "observational data favor models with a low @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest such models have either flat spatial hypersurfaces and a constant or time - variable cosmological  constant \" @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , peebles 1984 ; peebles & ratra 1988 ; sahni & starobinsky 2000 ; steinhardt 1999 ; carroll 2000 ; bintruy 2000 ) , or open spatial hypersurfaces and no @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , gott 1982 , 1997 ; ratra & peebles 1994 , 1995 ; kamionkowski et al .",
    "1994 ; grski et al . 1998 ) . for a constant @xmath0 ( with density parameter @xmath4 ) , these models lie along the lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , in the more general two - dimensional ( @xmath1 , @xmath4 ) model - parameter space . depending on the values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , models in this two - dimensional parameter space have either closed , flat , or open spatial hypersurfaces . in this paper",
    "we derive constraints on the parameters of the two - dimensional model as well as those of the special one - dimensional cases .",
    "we also derive constraints on the parameters of a spatially - flat model with a time - variable @xmath0 .",
    "the only known consistent model for a time - variable @xmath0 is that based on a scalar field ( @xmath7 ) with a scalar field potential @xmath8 ( ratra & peebles 1988 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on the favored model which at low @xmath9 has @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( peebles & ratra 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ) .",

    "we emphasize that in our analysis of this model here we do not make use of the time - independent equation of state fluid approximation to the model that has sometimes been used for such computations ( see the discussion in podariu & ratra 2000 ) .",

    "this is a difficult task .",
    "maor , brustein , & steinhardt ( 2001 ) note that even data of the quality anticipated from snap will not result in very tight constraints on an arbitrary equation of state .",
    "they consider a simple illustrative example , with an equation of state parameter @xmath13 that has two terms , one constant and the other linear in @xmath9 .",

    "after marginalizing over @xmath1 the peak - to - peak spread in their 2 @xmath2 contour for the equation of state at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , is about @xmath16 for @xmath17 , or about 43% of the value of @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to a symmetrized 2 @xmath2 uncertainty of about @xmath18 on @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding peak - to - peak spread in their 1 @xmath2 contour is about @xmath20 , which corresponds to a 1 @xmath2 uncertainty of about @xmath21 on @xmath15 . for fixed @xmath1 , the peak - to - peak spread in their 1 @xmath2 contour",

    "motivated by the approach adopted in analyses of current supernova apparent magnitude versus redshift data ( see , e.g. , riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , we instead focus on how well future supernova data will constrain parameters of various cosmological models technique ( see , e.g. , ganga , ratra , & sugiyama 1996 ; dodelson 2000 ; le dour et al .",

    "figure 1 shows examples of @xmath24 s computed in the time - variable @xmath0 model ( peebles & ratra 1988 ) .",
    "the error bars on the supernova fluxes are the ones that are most likely to be symmetric ( and thus allow for the simplest comparison between model predictions and observational data ) , so we work with flux @xmath25 for the comparison between model predictions and anticipated data . for our purposes ,",
    "the constant of proportionality in this relation is unimportant since the sne in the final reduced data set have been made standardized candles ( see , e.g. , phillips 1993 , and more recently riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .    for computational simplicity",
    "we assume supernova data from snap will be combined to provide fluxes and errors on fluxes for 67 uniform bins in redshift , of width @xmath26 , with the first one centered at @xmath27 and the last one at @xmath28 . in each bin",
    "the statistical and systematic errors are combined to give a flux error distribution with standard deviation @xmath29 .    to determine how well supernova data will distinguish between different sets of model - parameter values",
    ", we pick a fiducial set of model - parameter values which give a flux @xmath30 and compute @xmath31 where the sum runs over the 67 redshift bins and @xmath32 represents the model parameters , for instance @xmath1 and @xmath4 in the general two - dimensional constant @xmath0 case .",
    "@xmath33 is the number of standard deviations the model - parameter set @xmath32 lies away from that of the fiducial model .",
    "this representation ( eq . [ 1 ] ) is exact for the case where the correlated errors between redshift bins for the distance determinations are negligible .",
    "the error budget is summarized in the next section .",
    "results are presented and discussed in @xmath343 and we conclude in @xmath344 .",
    "the following provides a brief overview of the constraints that a satellite - based supernova program can place on both the statistical and many of the potential systematic errors . for a more complete discussion",
    "see the snap proposal .",
    "currently a single sn  ia provides a @xmath35 16% measurement of the flux ( @xmath35 8% in distance ) ( jha et al .",
    "1999 ) . a large fraction of this uncertainty almost certainly resides in the correction for extinction .",
    "by going to space one will be able to greatly increase the wavelength coverage and precision of the photometric measurements , thereby reducing this uncertainty considerably .",
    "( signal - to - noise of @xmath36 could be achieved for a sn at ab(1.0@xmath37 m ) = 27.0 , with systematics in the absolute photometry of @xmath381% . )",
    "the snap satellite has baselined 15 broad - band filters from about 0.3 to 1.7 @xmath37 m in addition to obtaining spectrophotometry near peak for each sn  ia . a conservative estimate of the intrinsic uncertainty for",
    "a given sn  ia with this type of data set would be @xmath35 10% in flux ( @xmath35 5% in distance ) .",
    "there is potential for reducing this even further through the identification of additional parameters that constrain the corrected peak luminosity of sne  ia beyond the single parameter of light - curve shape currently used . here",
    "we will conservatively assume that the statistical uncertainty in satellite - based sn  ia measurements such as these will be 10% in flux .",
    "@xmath39 statistics on 2000 sne  ia over the 67 aforementioned bins would provide an uncertainty of @xmath40% per bin .",
    "a major advantage of a space telescope is the much better opportunity for controlling ( or studying ) the many known ( and unknown ) sources of error .",
    "these include environmental effects , evolution , intergalactic dust , unusual cases which bias the distribution , etc .",
    "see , e.g. , howell , wang , & wheeler ( 2000 ) , aldering , knop , & nugent ( 2000 ) , croft et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , nomoto et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , barber ( 2000 ) , hamuy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , livio ( 2000 ) , totani ( 2000 ) , and gott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for discussions of some of these issues . without understanding and limiting these sources of error an accurate measurement of the cosmological parameters can not be obtained . here",
    "we mention a few of the potential sources of systematic errors and how space - based observations could constrain or eliminate them ( a more detailed discussion of these and other sources of systematic errors can be found in the snap proposal ) .",
    "_ malmquist bias_. this is the sampling bias due to any low - versus - high - redshift difference in detection efficiency of intrinsically fainter supernovae .",
    "for the aforementioned redshift range , the proposed experiment will attempt to detect every supernova in the observed region of sky at 10% of its peak brightness , thus eliminating this source of systematic uncertainty .    _",
    "extinction by `` ordinary '' dust_. the proposed experiment will attempt to obtain cross - wavelength - calibrated data with broad wavelength coverage for each supernova , so that the dimming of the spectrum as a function of wavelength can be measured with high signal - to - noise .",
    "furthermore , sne  ia in early - type galaxies with little to no extinction will be targeted to precisely determine the intrinsic colors of a sn  ia at a variety of light - curve shapes ( see riess et al .",
    "1996 for a study of this at low redshift ) .",
    "this would then allow one to study the ratio of selective to total absorption from dust and correct for any potential evolution of this ratio as a function of redshift .    _",
    "extinction by `` gray '' dust_. it has been suggested by aguirre ( 1999 ) that certain large ( up to @xmath410.1 ) , and possibly needle - like , dust grains can be expelled from galaxies via radiation pressure and can have an opacity curve that is shallow in optical bands , thus making them absorptive while producing only small color excess .",
    "such dust would lead the unwary cosmologist into underestimating @xmath42 or overestimating @xmath43 , thus producing a systematic bias .",
    "if there is gray dust that has had insufficient time to diffuse uniformly in intergalactic space , different lines of sight would have differing amounts of extinction due to clumping .",
    "this would result in an increase of observed supernova magnitude dispersion , an effect that is not seen in current observations , and could easily be detected by a space - based experiment .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to detect @xmath44 gray dust by comparing optical and near - ir photometry of sne ( both ia and ii ) found in this redshift range since the dust is not completely gray and will show a color excess over a large enough wavelength range ( see , e.g. , riess et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "_ sn  ia evolution_. sne  ia with different progenitor properties should result in explosions with slightly differing properties , even if there is only one mechanism for creating them , and even if this mechanism has a set `` trigger '' such as the chandrasekhar limit ( hflich et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if these differences are not corrected by the light curve width - luminosity relation presently in use , and if the distribution of key parameters of the progenitor stars changes with redshift , the sn  ia explosions observed at high redshift could differ in peak luminosity from those at low redshift , leading to a systematic error in the determination of the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , a dataset acquired from a space telescope should allow corrections for these differences , or allow similar sne  ia to be identified and matched at high and low redshifts thus mitigating against the effects of changing progenitor properties .",
    "one of the wonderful aspects of using sne  ia for cosmology is the fact that the supernova bares its entire history , from progenitor through explosion , to the observer .",
    "thus the supernova ca nt hide the effects of evolution since these will make themselves apparent in the light curves and spectra .",
    "figure 2 illustrates this statement .",
    "this shows the temporal spectral evolution of a typical sn  ia . at very early times",
    "one probes the outer , unburned layers left over from the progenitor . as seen in fisher et al .",
    "( 1997 ) this epoch displays spectral features from high - velocity carbon left over from the original progenitor and could be used to tightly constrain various theoretical models . at later times , near peak brightness , we are beginning to probe the layers of the atmosphere which show the intermediate - mass elements systhesized in the runaway thermonuclear explosion .",
    "nugent et al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed how some of the spectroscopic features of these elements ( & ) nicely correlate with the peak brightness of the sn  ia . finally , during the nebular phase , we note the strong emission lines at low velocity left over from the radioactive decay of @xmath45ni to @xmath45co to @xmath45fe .",
    "these observations allow one to directly probe the total amount of @xmath45ni synthesized during the explosion ( see kuchner et al .",
    "1994 and fisher et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "curtis et al . ( 2000 ) have identified a series of key observable supernova features that reflect differences in the underlying physics of the supernova . by measuring all of these features for each supernova",
    "one should be able to tightly constrain the physical conditions of the explosion , making it possible to recognize supernovae that have similar initial conditions and/or arise in matching galactic environments .",
    "the current theoretical models of sn  ia explosions are not sufficiently complete to predict the precise luminosity of each supernova , but they are able to give the rough correlations between changes in the physical conditions of the supernovae and the peak luminosity ( hflich , wheeler , & thielemann 1998 ) .",
    "these conditions include the velocity of the ejecta ( a measurement of the kinetic energy of the explosion ) , the opacity of the inner layers ( which affects the overall light curve shape ) , the metallicity of the progenitor ( which affects the early spectra ) , @xmath45ni mass ( a measurement of the total luminosity ) , and @xmath45ni distribution ( which might lead to small effects in the light curve shape at early time )",
    ". one can therefore give the approximate accuracy needed for the measurement of each feature to ensure that the physical condition of each set of supernovae is well enough determined so that the range of luminosities for those supernovae is well below the systematic uncertainty bound of @xmath412% when all the constraints are used together ( see curtis et al .",
    "2000 for a full description ) .",
    "for snap data @xmath29 ( eq . [ 1 ] ) is estimated to be 2% in each redshift bin up to @xmath46 , and then increasing linearly with redshift to 10% at @xmath3 .",
    "this is the",
    " neutral \" case .",
    "best \" case assumes that errors are limited by @xmath39 statistics ( with systematic errors at or below the 1% level ) , giving @xmath47 over the whole redshift range .",
    "the  worst \" case ( this is the baseline snap mission ) assumes @xmath48 to @xmath49 and @xmath50 from @xmath49 to @xmath3 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the ability of anticipated space telescope data to constrain cosmological - model parameters for the general two - dimensional constant @xmath0 case .",
    "snap data with even worst case error bars will lead to greatly improved cosmological - parameter determination ( see , e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 , and podariu & ratra 2000 for constraints from current data ) .",
    "we note that as expected the contours are elliptical , indicating that one combination of the parameters is better constrained than the other orthogonal combination ( see , e.g. , goobar & perlmutter 1995 ) .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the ability of space telescope data to distinguish between a constant and a time - variable @xmath0 in a spatially - flat model .",
    "the fiducial model here is a constant @xmath0 ( @xmath51 ) model with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "snap data with even worst case error bars will result in greatly improved discrimination ( see , e.g. , podariu & ratra 2000 for the current situation ) .",
    "we note again that the contours are elliptical .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the ability of space telescope data to constrain @xmath1 and @xmath54 in the spatially - flat time - variable @xmath0 model ( peebles & ratra 1988 ) . here",
    "the time - variable @xmath0 fiducial model has @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "again , snap will allow for tight constraints on these cosmological parameters .",
    "if other data ( such as cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements from map and planck surveyor and weak - lensing studies from the proposed snap mission ) pinned down some of the cosmological parameters , the supernova data would then be able to provide tighter constraints on the remaining parameters .",
    "for instance , figure 6 shows constraints from space telescope data on @xmath1 in a spatially - flat constant @xmath0 model and in an open @xmath57 model .",
    "as expected from the elliptical shape of the contours in figure 3 , anticipated supernova data will constrain @xmath1 more tightly in the spatially - flat case than in the open case . in both cases snap will provide tight constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , at 3 @xmath2 , in the spatially - flat model we find @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for neutral , worst , and best case errors , while in the open model we have @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for neutral , worst , and best case errors .",
