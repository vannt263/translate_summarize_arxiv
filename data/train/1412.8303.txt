    "in this note we will show that some refinements of notions appearing in a paper by daoui , mahzouli and zerouali @xcite in connection with local / restricted decomposability of multiplication operators on commutative , semisimple banach algebras have a close connection with alling s conjecture on the structure of closed prime ideals in @xmath1 .",

    "the character space ( or spectrum ) , @xmath9 , of @xmath7 is the set of all non - zero multiplicative linear functionals on @xmath7 .",
    "when endowed with the usual gelfand topology ( the relative weak-@xmath10-topology as a subset of @xmath11 ) , @xmath9 becomes a compact hausdorff space .",
    "using gelfand theory , we may identify @xmath9 with the maximal ideal space of @xmath7 . in the case where @xmath7 is semisimple",
    ", @xmath7 is isomorphic to the algebra @xmath12 consisting of the set of gelfand transforms @xmath13 of elements @xmath14 . in this case , identifying @xmath15 with @xmath16 , we may regard @xmath7 as a _",
    "banach function algebra _ on @xmath9 . with this identification",
    ", @xmath17 is equal to the spectral radius of @xmath15 in the algebra @xmath7 .",
    "if the spectral radius and the norm on @xmath7 are equal for all @xmath18 , then @xmath7 is a _",
    "uniform algebra _ on @xmath9 .",
    "it is useful to remember the result that a commutative , unital banach algebra @xmath7 is a uniform algebra if and only if @xmath19 for all @xmath14 . finally , the shilov boundary , @xmath20 , of @xmath7 is the smallest closed subset of @xmath9 on which every @xmath14 achieves its maximum modulus .",
    "we refer the reader to the books of dales @xcite ( especially chapter 4 ) , browder @xcite , gamelin @xcite , and leibowitz @xcite for various aspects of the theory of commutative banach algebras .    throughout this note",
    ", we will work only with semi - simple , unital , commutative banach algebras , and we look upon them as banach function algebras defined on their compact spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "some of our results are valid for more general algebras @xmath7 of complex - valued functions defined on sets other than @xmath9 , or for commutative banach algebras which are not semisimple",
    ". however , these more general algebras are not our primary concern . for the sake of clarity , we will not attempt to state our results in full generality .",
    "first we recall the definitions of regularity and normality for banach function algebras .",
    "let @xmath7 be a banach function algebra .    1 .",
    "@xmath7 is _ regular _ if , for all @xmath21 and all closed sets @xmath22 , there exists @xmath14 such that @xmath23 on @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; 2 .   @xmath7 is _ normal _ if , for each pair of disjoint closed sets @xmath24 and @xmath26 in @xmath9 there exists @xmath14 such that @xmath23 on @xmath24 and @xmath27 on @xmath26 .",
    "it is standard that regularity and normality are equivalent ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.1.18 ) ) .",
    "we next recall the definitions of the hull of an ideal and the kernel of a set , in order to define the hull - kernel topology on @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a banach function algebra .",
    "for @xmath14 , the _",
    "zero set _ of @xmath15 is the closed set @xmath28 , and is denoted by @xmath29 , or by @xmath30 if the algebra under consideration is clear .",
    "similarly , the _ hull _ ( or zero set ) of an ideal @xmath31 in @xmath7 is the closed set @xmath32 , and is denoted by @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 .",
    "then the _ kernel _ of @xmath24 is the closed ideal @xmath36 and is denoted by @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "provided that there is no ambiguity in the algebra @xmath7 under consideration , we denote by @xmath39 the hull of @xmath38 ; that is @xmath40 .",
    "the hull - kernel topology on @xmath9 is the topology whose closed sets are those sets @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "it is standard that the hull - kernel topology is a compact topology on @xmath9 which is weaker than the gelfand topology , and ( hence ) that these two topologies coincide if and only if the hull - kernel topology is hausdorff .",
    "this occurs if and only if the banach function algebra @xmath7 is regular ( and hence normal ) .",
    "the hull - kernel topology and regularity are also closely related to the decomposability of multiplication operators on @xmath7 , as discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for each ideal @xmath31 in @xmath7 , we have that @xmath34 is , in fact , hull - kernel closed .",
    "thus the hull - kernel closed subsets of @xmath9 are precisely the hulls of ideals in @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , for each @xmath14 , the hull of the principal ideal @xmath43 is simply @xmath30 , and so the zero sets of functions in @xmath7 are hull - kernel closed .",
    "in fact , the collection of co - zero sets @xmath44 is a base for the hull - kernel topology .",
    "we now consider the identity map on @xmath9 , @xmath45 , regarded as a map from @xmath9 with the hull - kernel topology to @xmath9 with the gelfand topology .",
    "it follows from the previous paragraphs that this map is continuous if and only if @xmath7 is regular . in @xcite , in order to discuss a localized ( point by point ) version of the connection between the hull - kernel topology and regularity , the points at which this map is continuous were investigated .",
    "let @xmath7 be a banach function algebra .",
    "for each @xmath14 , @xmath46 is the ( closed ) support of @xmath15 .    1 .",
    "a point @xmath21 is called a _ regularity point of type one _ for @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath47 , if for every neighborhood @xmath48 of @xmath49 in @xmath9 , there exists a function @xmath14 such that @xmath50 and the support of @xmath15 is contained in @xmath48 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath51 .",
    "then we say that @xmath7 is _ pointwise regular on @xmath4 _ , if every @xmath52 is a regularity point of type one for @xmath7 .",
    "we also say in that case that @xmath4 is _ a set of regularity ( of ) type one for @xmath7_.    it is clear that @xmath7 is regular if and only if @xmath9 is a set of regularity type one for @xmath7 .",
    "later on , in section [ three ] , we will determine for special algebras the largest set @xmath53 in @xmath9 on which @xmath7 is pointwise regular .",
    "that set may be empty , though .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the disk - algebra @xmath54 . if @xmath4 contains the shilov boundary of @xmath7 and if @xmath7 is pointwise regular on @xmath4 , then @xmath55 is a ` regular function algebra on @xmath4 ' in the sense as defined for example in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we do not know whether the converse holds .",
    "it follows from the results in @xcite that the points in @xmath56 are exactly those points @xmath21 for which the identity map @xmath45 is continuous at @xmath49 in the sense described above ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.1 ) .",
    "hence we may say that @xmath49 is a regularity point of type one if and only if @xmath49 is an _ @xmath57-continuity point _ for @xmath45 , ( or briefly called a point of continuity for @xmath7 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also known that @xmath21 is an @xmath57-continuity point for @xmath45 if and only if every function in @xmath7 is continuous at @xmath49 when @xmath9 is given the hull - kernel topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , the set of all @xmath57-continuity points for @xmath7 is the maximum @xmath57-continuity set for @xmath7 . for completeness ,",
    "let us say that @xmath21 is an _ @xmath57-discontinuity point _",
    ", if it is not an @xmath57-continuity point",
    ".    note also that if @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , then our notion of @xmath4 being a set of regularity type one for @xmath7 is equivalent to the notion of @xmath3-regularity of @xmath7 given in @xcite .    finally , we note that any regularity point of type one ( or equivalently any @xmath57-continuity point for @xmath7 ) is necessarily contained in the shilov boundary @xmath20 of @xmath7 .",
    "this fact , which is stated near the top of page 57 of @xcite , is almost immediate from the definitions .",
    "so this gives us one of many possible notions of partial regularity for @xmath7 .",
    "we continue this section by giving some related partial regularity conditions involving @xmath60-hulls , as introduced in @xcite in order to study spectral synthesis sets in @xmath61 ; see also @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be a banach function algebra .    1 .   for @xmath21 ,",
    "let @xmath62 ( or simply @xmath63 if the algebra @xmath7 is unambiguous ) be the ideal of those functions in @xmath7 that vanish ( within @xmath9 ) in a neighborhood of @xmath49 .",
    "the hull of @xmath62 is denoted by @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) , and is called the @xmath60-hull of @xmath49 .",
    "a point @xmath21 is called a _ regularity point of type two _ , denoted by @xmath66 , if @xmath67 .",
    "note that in @xcite , the elements @xmath68 were called @xmath69-points .",
    "for the readers convenience , we present a short proof that @xmath7 is regular if and only if each @xmath21 is a regularity point of type two .    [ khull ] let @xmath7 be a banach function algebra .",
    "then @xmath7 is regular if and only if @xmath67 for every @xmath21 ; in other words @xmath70 .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is regular ; that is @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath74 , there is @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "thus @xmath77 .",
    "hence @xmath67 .    now suppose that @xmath67 for every @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath24 a compact subset of @xmath79 .",
    "then , for each @xmath80 , there exists @xmath81 with @xmath82 . a standard compactness argument then yields the desired function @xmath83 with @xmath27 on @xmath24 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus @xmath85 is a regularity point of type one and so @xmath7 is regular .    the properties of @xmath69-points and @xmath57-continuity points were discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath49 is not an @xmath69-point for @xmath7 , then the points of @xmath86 are points of @xmath57-discontinuity for @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , @xmath49 is a point of @xmath57-discontinuity for @xmath7 if and only if there is at least one point @xmath87 with @xmath88 ; each such point @xmath89 is then a non-@xmath69-point for @xmath7 .",
    "another way to say this is that @xmath49 is a point of @xmath57-continuity for @xmath7 if and only if there are no points @xmath87 with @xmath88 . in general , though , there are no inclusion relations between the set @xmath56 of @xmath57-continuity points and the set @xmath90 of @xmath69-points .",
    "we now define the notion of @xmath0-analyticity for subsets of @xmath9 , a notion which is in some sense opposite to the notions of sets of regularity type one or two .",
    "it incorporates the fact that some trace of analyticity remains when the functions are restricted to a given set , essentially the identity principle / quasianalyticity for the restrictions of the functions .",
    "let @xmath7 be a banach function algebra , and let @xmath91 .",
    "we say that @xmath24 is a _",
    "@xmath0-analytic set _ for @xmath7 ( or simply @xmath24 is _",
    "@xmath0-analytic_ if the algebra @xmath7 is clear ) , if for every @xmath14 and every relatively open , nonvoid subset @xmath92 in @xmath24 one has that @xmath27 on @xmath92 implies that @xmath27 on @xmath24 .",
    "we say that @xmath24 is _ componentwise @xmath0-analytic _",
    "( for @xmath7 ) if every connected component of @xmath24 is a @xmath0-analytic set .    the most obvious @xmath0-analytic sets are singletons and the empty set .",
    "in @xcite the authors only consider the case where @xmath24 is an open set in @xmath9 .",
    "they say that a banach function algebra @xmath7 is _ @xmath2-analytic _ if @xmath93 is an open @xmath0-analytic set for @xmath7 .",
    "they claim and attempt to prove that there exists a maximum open set @xmath2 for which @xmath7 is @xmath2-analytic .",
    "however this claim and its proof are incorrect .",
    "we give the following easy example to demonstrate this .",
    "this example also shows that a union of open @xmath0-analytic sets need not be @xmath0-analytic , contrary to an implicit assumption made in @xcite    let @xmath4 be a ( non - empty ) compact set in @xmath8 and @xmath94 its interior .",
    "then @xmath95 denotes the uniform algebra @xmath96 . by a theorem of arens ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3.14 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ii , theorem 1.9 ) ) , we have @xmath97 .",
    "now consider the closed disks @xmath98 and @xmath99 . set @xmath100 , and let @xmath7 be the uniform algebra @xmath95 . then @xmath101 , and the sets @xmath102 and @xmath103 are open @xmath0-analytic sets for @xmath7 , but @xmath104 is clearly not a @xmath0-analytic set for @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , no @xmath0-analytic set for @xmath7 can meet both @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus there is no maximum open @xmath0-analytic set for @xmath7 in this case .",
    "all the subsequent results  in @xcite that use this incorrect claim must be adapted appropriately .",
    "note , however , that it is true that , whenever @xmath102 and @xmath103 are open @xmath0-analytic sets for @xmath7 such that @xmath105 , then @xmath104 is also an open @xmath0-analytic set for @xmath7 .",

    "since @xmath111 is @xmath0-analytic , @xmath27 on @xmath111 .",

    "hence @xmath107 is @xmath0-analytic .",
    "let @xmath7 be a banach function algebra , and let @xmath123 be the set of all those open subsets @xmath92 of @xmath9 such that all of the connected components of @xmath92 are also open in @xmath9 .",

    "all these @xmath130 are open ; hence @xmath107 is open .",
    "thus @xmath128 .",
    "next we show that @xmath132 .",
    "again , let @xmath107 be a connected component of @xmath48 . in the representation for @xmath107 above , all the @xmath130 are open and @xmath0-analytic for @xmath7 ; hence , by lemma [ unions ]",
    ", @xmath107 is @xmath0-analytic .    in particular ,",
    "if @xmath9 is locally connected , then @xmath123 is simply the whole of the topology on @xmath9 , and we see that the set @xmath48 is the maximum , open , componentwise @xmath0-analytic set for @xmath7",
    ". however , if @xmath9 is not locally connected , there may be a shortage of connected open sets .",
