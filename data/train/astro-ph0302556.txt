    "radio follow - up of x - ray sources have played an important role in the optical identification program of the x - ray sources by providing position accurate to @xmath3 1@xmath9 .",
    "this was particular true for the x - ray sources detected during the @xmath10 , asca and @xmath1sax x - ray missions for which the typical positional error is a circle of about 1 arcmin radius .",
    "a radio detection within the x - ray error box gives fundamental information on the position of the x - ray sources .",
    "in fact , since the majority of the bright extragalactic x - ray sources are associated with agn , a radio source within the x - ray error box is physically associated to the x - ray source with a very high probability .",
    "for this reason , many of the optical identification programs of the x - ray sources have made an intensive use of the radio data ( see for example stocke et al .",
    "1991 for the identification of the x - ray sources of the @xmath10 extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) and akiyama et al .",
    "2000 for the identification of the x - ray sources in the asca large sky survey ( lss ) ) .",
    "moreover , the radio data coupled with the optical and x - ray photometry allow us to compute the broad - band two point spectral indices @xmath2 and @xmath11 providing valuable information on the nature of the x - ray source population even in the absence of optical spectroscopy ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "a complete radio follow - up of x - ray selected samples is also an important tool to study the differences between agns that are strong radio - sources ( radio - loud , rl ) and those that are radio - quiet ( rq ) . although the two classes have similar spectral index distributions ( seds ) outside the radio band ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , their luminosity functions show differences in all the bands in which they have been studied ( la franca et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the optical band , using the pg sample of optically selected agn , padovani ( 1993 ) has shown that the shapes of the luminosity functions for rl and rq are different .",
    "similar results have been obtained by della ceca et al .",
    "1994 and ciliegi et al .",
    "1995 studying the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of rl and rq separately .",
    "in particular della ceca et al . (",
    "1994 ) found a flattening of the xlf of the rl sample for @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 . as a result",
    "the expected fraction of rl agns is a function of the x - ray flux limit in x - ray surveys .",
    "they predict that this fraction is @xmath3 13 per cent for @xmath14 and decreases to @xmath32.5 per cent for @xmath15 .",
    "radio follow - ups of x - ray selected samples seems to confirm this prediction .",
    "in fact , while shallow x - ray sample like the @xmath16 large sky survey ( akiyama et al .",
    "2000 ) with a flux limit of @xmath17 shows a fraction of rl around 10 per cent , deep ( @xmath18 ) rosat samples show a fraction of rl between 2 and 4 per cent ( ciliegi et al .",

    "in this paper we report the results of the radio follow - up of all the 147 x - ray sources detected by the @xmath1sax - mecs instrument in the framework of the high energy llarge area survey ( hellas ) .",
    "this survey has observed about 85 deg@xmath19 of the sky in the 5 - 10 kev band down to a flux of 4 - 5 @xmath20 10@xmath21 .",
    "the whole survey and catalogue is described by fiore et al .",

    "finally , the spectroscopic identification of the hellas sources and the study of their evolution have been presented by la franca et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter lf02 ) .",
    "the 20 hellas sources with a declination further south than @xmath2240 deg have been observed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) while the 127 sources with dec@xmath2340 deg have been observed with the very large array ( vla ) . for these latter sources a complete covering at 20 cm down to the 5 @xmath0 flux limit of 2.5",
    "mjy is already available with the nrao / vla sky survey ( nvss , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) while the first survey ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters , white et al .",
    "1997 ) is available only for 27 hellas sources ( 5 @xmath0 limit of @xmath3 1 mjy ) .    in order to obtain information also on the radio spectral properties of the hellas sources we adopted the following strategy .",
    "all the 147 hellas sources have been observed at 6 cm down to a 1 @xmath0 flux limit of @xmath3 0.10 - 0.25 mjy .",
    "for the 20 hellas sources observed with the atca , we take advantage of the fact that the 6 and 3 cm receivers of the atca share a common feed - horn and we observed simultaneously also at 3 cm , obtaining a 3 cm flux limit of @xmath3 0.22 mjy ( 1 @xmath0 level ) .    the wavelength of 6 cm and the flux limit reached ( 0.10 - 0.25 mjy )",
    "can be considered a good compromise between a deep radio survey and the necessity of avoiding strong contamination from spurious radio sources within the x - ray error box .",
    "the expected number of 6 cm sources is in fact n(s)=(0.42@xmath70.05)(s/30)@xmath24 where n(s ) is the number of sources per arcmin@xmath19 with a flux density @xmath25s @xmath26jy ( fomalont et al .",
    "considering for the x - ray error box a circle of 1 arcmin radius ( see below ) and a 3 @xmath0 limit of 0.3 mjy , we expect that only 0.1 radio source lies just by chance within the hellas error box .",
    "going deeper in the radio flux ( reaching , for example , a 3 @xmath0 limit of 0.05 mjy ) will increase the number of chance coincidence within the hellas error box to 0.7 .",
    "on the other hand , at 20 cm the situation is more critical , since at 0.3 mjy the number of chance coincidence expected within an hellas error box is @xmath3 0.3 .",
    "the atca observations of the 20 hellas sources were performed on june 1999 .",
    "they were made with the atca simultaneously at two different frequencies : 4.848 and 8.640 ghz ( referred to as 6 and 3 cm in the rest of the paper ) .",
    "the synthesized beam ( full width at half power ) is 2 arcsec at 6 cm and 1 arcsec at 3 cm .",
    "the primary flux density calibrator was pks b1934@xmath22638 , whose flux densities at different frequencies are incorporated directly in the calibration software .",
    "the data were calibrated and reduced using the atca reduction package miriad ( multi - channel image reconstruction image analysis and display ) . for each field a 512@xmath20512 pixel image was constructed , with a pixel size of 1 arcsec at 6 cm and of 0.3 arcsec at 3 cm .",
    "the minimum root mean square ( rms ) noise obtained in each field is @xmath3 0.25 mjy at 6 cm and @xmath3 0.22 mjy at 3 cm ( 1 @xmath0 level ) .",
    "the vla observations were performed on 11 april 2000 at 4.885 ghz ( 6 cm ) in c configuration . with this configuration and frequency",
    ", the synthesized beam size is @xmath3 4 arcsec .",
    "all the data were analyzed with the nrao aips reduction package .",
    "the data were calibrated using 3c286 as primary flux density calibrator . as for the atca data , for each field a 512@xmath20512 pixel image ( @xmath3 8.5@xmath208.5 arcmin@xmath19 ) was constructed with a pixel size of 1 arcsec . for the majority of the fields",
    "the 1 @xmath0 noise obtained in the central area is comparable to the expected one ( @xmath3 0.1 mjy ) .",
    "there are however some fields in which the noise is slightly higher due to problems during data acquisitions or due to the presence of a nearby strong radio source .",
    "using our 6 cm maps , we searched for radio sources within the x - ray error box of all the 147 hellas sources published in fiore et al . 2001 .",
    "the hellas error box has been assumed to be of 90 arcsec , in order to be absolutely conservative in the cross - correlation process , even though it must be noted that on average the @xmath1sax position of the hellas sources are better defined than 90 arcsec ( see appendix i of fiore et al .",
    "2001 for a detailed discussion of the position accuracy of the hellas sources ) .",
    "for the low number of high - galactic latitude fields with neither a target nor a known x - ray source in the same field of view the error box has been assumed to be of 2 arcmin since no correction to the astrometry was possible ( vignali 2001 ) .",
    "for all the radio sources detected within the hellas error box we have computed the probability of random association with the x - ray source .",
    "assuming that the radio sources belong to a poissonian distributed population of sources ,    @xmath27 + gives the probability to have a random association within a distance @xmath28 ( distance between the x - ray position and the radio position of the possible counterpart ) with a radio source having a flux greater than s. n(s ) is the expected number of source with flux greater than that of the possible counterpart ( see section 2 ) .",
    "as first step , p@xmath290.01 was chosen as a convenient threshold to accept a radio / x - ray association .",
    "we have 32 radio / x - ray associations with p@xmath290.01 .",
    "however , we note that this threshold represents only a starting point in the radio x - ray association process since further and more tightening constraints on the most likely associations come from the position of the optical counterparts of the hellas sources reported in lf02 . using a subsample of 118 hellas sources ( enclosed in a region with dec@xmath3079 deg and outside 5@xmath31ra@xmath32 and",
    "17@xmath31ra@xmath33 ) they report the optical identification of 61 hellas : 37 type 1 agn , 9 type 2 agn , 5 narrow emission - line galaxies ( elg ) , 6 cluster , 2 bl lac , 1 radio galaxy and 1 star . of these 61 sources ,",
    "24 have a radio counterpart within 5 arcsec and with p@xmath34 0.0002 ( p@xmath35 has been calculated as p@xmath36 using the distance between the radio and optical position as value for @xmath28 ) .",
    "assuming that all the 24 radio / optical associations are real associations ( as suggested by their low p@xmath35 values ) , we analyzed their p@xmath36 values . for 19 radio / optical associations we found p@xmath290.01 ,",
    "4 have 0.01@xmath30p@xmath290.1 and one has p@xmath370.217 .",
    "the large value of p@xmath36 for the 5 sources with p@xmath380.01 is due to the fact that for these sources the distance between the radio / optical position and the x - ray position is greater than 60 arcsec ( see lf02 for a discussion on the procedure of the optical identification of the hellas sources ) . in the light of these results",
    ", we increase our threshold for the radio x - ray associations to p@xmath370.1 ( @xmath39 we expect that about 10 per cent of the proposed identifications may be spurious positional coincidences ) . with this new threshold we found 53 x - ray / radio associations .",
    "we do not have x - ray sources with two ( or more ) radio counterparts both with p@xmath290.1 .",

    "this value is comparable to that obtained by akiyama et al .",

    "[ tab_rx_ass ] we report a summary of different x - ray surveys for which a complete radio follow - up is available .",
    "all these surveys are `` agn dominated '' in the sense that the large majority of their identification ( @xmath4675% ) are associated with agns . for each survey",
    "we report the x - ray and radio limits , the radio - to - x - ray limit ratio fr / f@xmath47 assuming an x - ray spectral index @xmath48=1.0 , the percentage of radio / x associations ( number of radio / x - ray association over the total number of x - ray sources in the survey ) and the fraction of radio - loud objects in the radio / x - ray associations .",
    "as clearly shown in the table , the percentage of radio / x - ray associations is a function , as expected , of fr / f@xmath47 : the lower this ratio is ( @xmath49 deeper radio data in comparison to the x - ray flux limit ) the higher is the fraction of x - ray objects with a radio counterpart .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ x_radio_ratio ] suggests ( as proposed also by akiyama et al .",
    "2000 ) that this change in the percentage of radio / x - ray associations is due to the fact that when fr / f@xmath47 becomes very low we start seeing also radio - quiet agns . to check",
    "if this is the case , in figure  [ radioflux_aro ] we plot the 6 cm radio flux as function of the two point spectral index @xmath2 for the hellas sources and for the 12 radio / x - ray associations found in the asca lss ( using a radio spectral index @xmath50=0.7 to convert the radio fluxes from 20 cm to 6 cm ) .",
    "the solid line shows the limit beyond which a source can not be detected in the optical band due to the magnitude limit of the optical data .",
    "the line in figure  [ radioflux_aro ] has been drawn using r=21 .",
    "as clearly shown in figure , going deeper in the radio data we start to see the radio - quiet population ( @xmath510.35 ) .",
    "this population is almost completely absent at radio flux level greater than 10 - 20 mjy but becomes the dominant population at radio fluxes lower than @xmath31 mjy . from figure  [ radioflux_aro ]",
    "it is also evident that deep optical data are needed in order to detect in the optical band radio - loud sources with radio fluxes lower than a few mjy .",
    "moreover it is interesting to note that the 3 x - ray surveys with the highest percentage of radio / x - ray associations ( emss , lss and hellas ) are all selected in the medium or hard x - ray band ( see table  [ tab_rx_ass ] ) , while the 3 x - ray surveys with the lowest percentage of radio / x - ray associations ( lockman , marano and crss ) are all selected in the soft x - ray band .",
    "in addition to the lowest radio - to - x - ray flux ratio available in the emss , lss and hellas surveys , the higher percentage of radio / x - ray associations could also be due to the selection in the hard x - ray band .",
    "in fact , since the radio emission is transparent against obscuring material , obscured agns are detected in an unbiased way in the radio wavelength as well as in the hard x - ray band , but they could be missed in samples selected in the soft x - ray band where obscuration effects are much more relevant . to test this hypothesis",
    "we calculate the fraction of radio / x - ray associations in the hellas and lss surveys using a radio flux limits of 3.7 mjy and 3.2 mjy respectively , in order to have an fr / f@xmath47 similar to that of the soft x - ray selected samples ( see table  [ tab_rx_ass ] ) .",
    "we found a percentage of radio / x - ray associations around 20% , i.e. still higher than that found in soft x - ray selected samples . in conclusion",
    "the higher fraction of radio / x - ray associations found in the emss , lss and hellas surveys in comparison to the soft x - ray selected samples is probably due to a combination of two effects : deeper radio data in comparison to the x - ray flux limit and the selection in harder x - ray bands .",
    "recently new deep x - ray samples have been obtained thanks to the revolutionary capabilities of the @xmath52 x - ray satellite . the deep surveys ( brandt et al .",
    "2001 , rosati et al .",
    "2002 ) have reached flux limits at least two orders of magnitude lower than the fainter samples listed in table  [ tab_rx_ass ] .",
    "extensive programs of optical identifications showed that most of the sources in these samples are not agn .",
    "the bulk of the optical identifications in these deep x - ray surveys is associated with normal galaxies , the majority of which show strong emission lines indicative of star formation activity ( barger et al .",
    "2001 , brandt et al .",
    "2001,bauer et al .",
    "however , the most surprising finding is the discovery of a sizeable number of relatively bright x - ray sources spectroscopically identified with early - type `` normal '' galaxies without any signature of nuclear activity in the optical spectra ( fiore et al .",
    "2000 , barger et al .",
    "these optically normal x - ray luminous galaxies were thought to be relatively rare , unusual objects , but during the recent deep x - ray surveys obtained with @xmath52 and xmm we saw a remarkable increase of their number ( comastri et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the radio properties of these new deep x - ray samples have been studied using very deep vla radio survey ( down to few micro jy at 1.4 ghz ) obtained in the ssa13 field ( barger et al .",
    "2001 ) and in the hdf - n ( bauer et al .",
    "these studies showed a different behavior of these new samples in comparison to the `` agn - dominated '' samples .",
    "in fact , in the new deep x - ray surveys a very high percentage of radio / x - ray associations ( up to 80% in the ssa13 field , see barger et al . 2001 ) has been found , with the highest matching fraction found among the emission line galaxies , which are comprised of apparently normal and starburst galaxies at redshift of z@xmath30.1 - 1.3 thought to be undergoing recent star formation .",
    "the nature of the radio / x - ray associations is therefore completely different between that found in the `` agn dominated '' samples reported in table 2 and that found in the new deep x - ray surveys . while the former are associated with an agn activity , the latter are mainly associated with a star forming activity .      using all the radio data available at 3 , 6 and 20",
    "cm we were able to calculate the radio spectral index ( or an upper / lower limit when the source is detected in only one radio band ) for a total of 50 hellas sources .",
    "since the majority of the spectral indices have been calculated using the 6 cm fluxes obtained with our observations and the 20 cm fluxes reported in the public catalogues ( nvss and first ) , their values should be treated as approximate since the images used to measure the fluxes were not matched in resolution .",
    "we also caution that variability among the radio agn is a legitimate concern and could lead to inaccurate spectral index estimates since the two radio bands were observed several years apart .",
    "all the radio spectral index @xmath53 are reported in column x of table 1 , while in figure  [ alphar_aro ] we plot @xmath53 as function of the two point spectral index @xmath2 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line denotes the typical spectral index , @xmath53=0.5 , separating steep and flat spectrum radio sources .",
    "steep spectral indices ( @xmath540.5 ) often indicate radio emission from star formation or lobe - dominated agn , while flat ones ( @xmath550.5 ) often indicate emission from core - dominated agn ( e.g. kellermann and owen 1988 ) .",
    "a statistical analysis using both the measured values and the limits to @xmath53 has been performed with the software package asurv , which implements the methods described by feigelson & nelson ( 1985 ) and isobe , feigelson & nelson ( 1986 ) .",
    "we divided our sources according to their optical classification studying the mean radio spectral index of sources with broad emission lines ( agn1 , open circles in figure  [ alphar_aro ] ) and with narrow emission lines ( agn2 plus emission line galaxies , filled symbols in figure  [ alphar_aro ] ) .",
    "we found that while the type 1 agns have a mean radio spectral index of @xmath560.10 , the type 2 agns plus the emission line galaxies have a steeper radio spectral index @xmath570.11 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the idea that the radio emission from type 1 agns is core dominated with a flat radio spectral index due to the self - absorption process . on the other hand , in type 2 agn and emission line galaxies",
    "the nonthermal radio emission ( either due to a compact nucleus or to the integrated emission arising from the supernovae remnants in a starburst region ) takes place on larger physical scale without self - absorption . for the case of the star formation",
    "these scales correspond approximately to 0.1 - 1.0 kpc as observed in the local elgs population ( condon 1989 , condon 1992 ) while for the core dominated sources these scales correspond to few parsec as well - know from many different radio surveys ( see nagar et al .",
    "2000,2002 and giovannini et al .",
    "2001 for the most recent works ) . under this hypothesis",
    ", we expect a more extended radio emission from the hellas type 2 agns and elgs in comparison to the radio emission from the hellas type 1 agns .",
    "sub - arcsecond radio observations are needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "starting from the 61 spectroscopically identified sample of 118 hellas sources published by lf02 we selected a subsample of 46 agns ( 37 type 1 + 9 type 2 ) brighter than 5 @xmath20 10@xmath21 in the 5 - 10 kev band and brighter than r=21 and r=19 ( for type 1 and type 2 agns ) in the optical band .",
    "radio data are available for all the 46 hellas agns . using the two point spectral index @xmath2=0.35 we divided the sources in rl and rq .",

    "( see their figure 11 ) .",
    "we present the results of a complete radio follow - up down to a 6 cm flux limit of about 0.3 mjy ( 3 @xmath0 ) obtained with the vla and atca radio telescopes of all the 147 x - ray sources detected in the @xmath1sax hellas survey .",
    "our major conclusions are as follows .",
    "@xmath59 from a statistical analysis based on the x - ray , optical and radio position , we found 53 x - ray / radio associations over a total of 147 sources .",
    "we estimated that about 10% ( @xmath39 @xmath3 5 sources ) of the proposed associations may be spurious and therefore the percentage of the `` real '' x - ray / radio associations is in the range @xmath333 - 36% .",
    "this percentage is in agreement to that obtained in other x - ray surveys selected in the hard x - ray band and is significantly greater than the percentage found in surveys selected in the soft x - ray band .",
    "this is probably due to a combination of two effects : the availability of deeper radio data in comparison to the x - ray flux limit and a selection in harder x - ray band .",
    "obscured agns are in fact missed in soft x - ray selected samples , while they are detected in the radio and hard x - ray bands since both these wavelengths are transparent against obscuring material .",
    "this change in the percentage and nature of the radio / x - ray associations that we start to see in the hellas survey is much more evident in the new deep x - ray @xmath52 samples .",
    "radio observations at the micro jy level of the @xmath52 samples showed , in fact , that the radio / x - ray associations in these samples are dominated by normal galaxies and starburst at z@xmath3 0.1 - 1.3 .",
    "@xmath59 the value of @xmath60 used to separate the radio - loud and radio - quiet sources has been estimated using the lee statistic .",
    "of the 53 hellas radio / x - ray associations , 26 have been classified as radio - loud sources . from the analysis of the ratio between the radio and the x - ray fluxes , we have assumed that all the 63 sources for which it was impossible to calculate the two point spectral index @xmath2 ( and than to obtain a classification in rq or rl sources ) are likely to be radio - quiet objects . under this hypothesis , the fraction of radio - loud objects in the hellas sample is @xmath318 per cent .",
    "@xmath59 the analysis of the multiband photometric data based on the two point spectral indices @xmath2 and @xmath11 has shown that the identified radio - loud objects are associated mainly with type 1 agn with l@xmath4 erg / s , while the identified type 2 agns and emission line galaxies are radio - quiet sources with l@xmath5 erg / s .",
    "rq type 1 agns and type 2 agns can not be distinguished only on the basis of their photometric data . on the basis of these results",
    "we would conclude that all the unidentified sources with @xmath2 @xmath61 0.30 - 0.35 and @xmath62 1.5 are likely to be type 1 agn .",
    "@xmath59 the analysis of radio spectral index has shown that type 1 agns have a mean spectral index flatter than type 2 agns and emission line galaxies .",
    "this result is in agreement with the idea that the core - dominated radio emission from type 1 agns is self - absorbed , while in agn2 and emission line galaxies the radio emission take place on larger physical scale , without self - absorption .",

    "<S> we found 53 x - ray / radio likely associations , corresponding to about one third of the x - ray sample . using the two point spectral index @xmath2=0.35 we divided all the hellas x - ray sources in radio quiet and radio loud . </S>",
    "<S> we have 26 sources classified as radio - loud objects , corresponding to @xmath318% of the hellas sample . in agreement with previous results , </S>",
    "<S> the identified radio - loud sources are associated mainly with type 1 agns with l@xmath4 erg / s , while all the identified type 2 agns and emission line galaxies are radio quiet objects with l@xmath5 erg / s . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the radio spectral index suggests that type 1 agns have a mean radio spectral index ( @xmath6=0.25@xmath70.1 ) flatter than type 2 agns and emission line galaxies ( @xmath8=0.69@xmath70.11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with the idea that the core - dominated radio emission from type 1 agns is self - absorbed , while in agn2 and emission line galaxies the radio emission take place on larger physical scale , without self - absorption .    </S>",
