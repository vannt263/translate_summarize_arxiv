    "in a radio frequency ( rf ) photonic oscillator that utilizes an optical frequency comb the signal is produced by demodulating the equally spaced frequency harmonics of the comb on a fast photodiode .",
    "the relative coherence , or phase locking of the optical frequency harmonics , is a necessary condition for generation of spectrally pure rf signals .",
    "the performance of the best photonic generators is far superior to electronic devices .",
    "for instance , generation of 10  ghz signals with phase noise at the level of -100 dbc / hz at 1  hz offset and -179  dbc / hz at 1  mhz and higher offsets were demonstrated with a femtoscond mode locked laser @xcite .",
    "this phase noise level is 40  db lower compared with phase noise of the best room - temperature electronic oscillator .",
    "the achieved spectral purity of the photonic device could be spoiled by back - end electronic amplifiers because of their inherent noise . however , another attribute of the photonic oscillator is that amplifiers are usually not required , since the output power of a 10  ghz rf source can reach 25  mw when a uni - traveling carrier photodiode is utilized @xcite .",
    "phase noise is the main characteristic determining the performance of an oscillator and its practical usefulness .",
    "optical monolithic microresonator - based rf photonic oscillators are advantageous for providing low noise rf signals on a chip .",
    "development of rf generation with hyper - parametric oscillators and mode - locked ( kerr ) frequency combs has recently become the major direction in this area @xcite .",
    "for example , phase noise of a whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) resonator - based hyper - parametric rf photonic oscillator is much lower as compared with the noise of existing electronic oscillators such as dielectric resonator oscillators .",
    "packaged 35  ghz kerr comb rf photonic oscillators with phase noise of -115 dbc / hz at 10  khz offset and -130 dbc / hz at 100  khz offset were previously demonstrated and have became commercially available @xcite .",
    "a miniature 10  ghz rf photonic oscillator characterized with phase noise better than -60  dbc / hz at 10  hz , -90  dbc / hz at 100  hz , -120  dbc / hz at 1  khz , and -150  dbc / hz at 10  mhz was demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "the frequency stability of this device is at the level of @xmath0 at 1 - 100  s integration time @xcite , which is better than existing rf photonic devices of similar size , weight , and power consumption .",
    "quantum noise limited phase diffusion of the microresonator - based hyper - parametric rf photonic oscillator can be described by a schawlow - townes - like formula @xcite .",
    "a leeson model can be used far enough from the rf carrier to understand the behavior of the phase noise @xcite .",
    "the phase noise of the kerr comb oscillator operating in the mode locked regime has been recently analyzed as well @xcite . in accordance with the obtained theoretical formula ,",
    "the phase noise of the mode locked kerr frequency comb oscillator made with a 7  mm magnesium fluoride wgm resonator , having a quality factor of @xmath1 and pumped with 5  mw of optical power , is expected to be -90  dbc / hz at 10  hz , -110  dbc / hz at 100  hz , -130  dbc / hz at 1  khz , and -154  dbc / hz at 10  mhz .",
    "the predicted noise floor , determined by the shot noise of the oscillator , matches the measured value @xcite well .",
    "the measured close - in noise , however , is significantly worse than the predicted number .",
    "evidently , there exists a mechanism that increases the oscillator noise well above the quantum limit .    in this paper",
    "we analyze classical transfer functions describing the impact of amplitude and frequency noise of the pump laser on the repetition rate of the kerr frequency comb generated in a continuously pumped monolithic microresonator ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as an example of the frequency comb generator ) . using this result",
    ", we analyze the noise of the kerr comb rf photonic oscillator and show that classical noise of the pump laser can be an important limiting factor on the performance of the oscillator .",
    "we start with a simple analytical model of the resonant hyper - parametric oscillation that involves interaction of light confined in three resonator modes .",
    "the central mode is pumped optically .",
    "the oscillation can be described as a nondegenerate parametric process in which two pump photons are transformed to two different photons of lower and higher frequencies .",
    "this occurs when the pump power exceeds a certain threshold determined by the loss of the system , and by nonlinear coupling efficiency between the resonator modes .",
    "we show that the beat frequency between the pump laser and generated sidebands does not depend on the laser parameters , if all the modes have the same quality ( q- ) factor .",
    "the dependence on the parameters of the pump light emerges as soon as the degeneracy of the q - factor is lifted .",
    "both amplitude and phase modulation of the pump can be transferred to the beat frequency of the optical harmonics of the oscillator .",
    "the phase and amplitude noise of the pump can impact the beat frequency as well .",
    "a large variety of nonlinear processes takes place in an optically pumped nonlinear microresonator .",
    "we here focus at mode - locked kerr frequency comb and mode - locked hyper - parametric oscillation that behave in a similar way .",
    "both processes are characterized with hard excitation regime and the fundamental noise of both processes can be described by similar analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "generation of the mode - locked kerr frequency comb is different from the hyper - parametric oscillation only in a sense that a large number of nearly equal power frequency harmonics are generated from the cw optical pump , in contrast with a pair of optical harmonics considered in the hyper - parametric oscillator model .",
    "mode - locked hyper - parametric oscillation occurs in resonators with relatively large group velocity dispersion , while kerr combs are generated in resonators with a small dispersion value . to modify the dispersion value one needs to change loading of the resonator modes",
    "it is possible to transfer a narrow frequency comb to a broad frequency comb adiabatically by changing the loading accompanied by proper change of the pump power and frequency .",
    "this fact proves physical identity of the combs .",
    "even though the narrow and broad combs are identical , an analytic description of noise transfer for the broad frequency comb is not straightforward .",
    "we perform a numerical simulation of the system and solve a set of ordinary differential equations describing the comb @xcite to find the impact of noise transfer process on a realistic kerr comb oscillator .",
    "we evaluate the corresponding modulation of the comb power and repetition rate by adding modulation to the amplitude and phase of the pump , and subsequently infer the corresponding transfer functions that aid estimating the impact of the pump noise on those parameters .",
    "there is no transfer if the resonator spectrum is characterized with second order group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) only and all the modes have the same q - factor . by substituting realistic asymmetry parameters to the model",
    "we find that the impact of a noisy pump light can be rather significant .",
    "a natural way to reduce this influence is to utilize a low noise pump laser .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i we provide an analytical model of hyper - parametric oscillation and study the dependence of its frequency on parameters of the pump light .",
    "numerical simulations involving kerr frequency comb are described in section ii .",
    "we discuss how the approximations considered in the paper are related to realistic resonators in section iii .",
    "section iv concludes the paper .",
    "the theory of hyper parametric oscillation presented here is related to the theory of additive modulational instability in ring lasers @xcite , and in fiber - based optical parametric oscillators @xcite . in the case of high - q wgm hyper - parametric oscillator",
    "the theory was developed in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the model @xcite to analyze the dependence of the frequency of a hyper - parametric oscillator on the frequency and power of the pump laser .",
    "we show that an ideal symmetry in the oscillation process results in complete suppression of the influence of the pump parameters on the frequency interval between the pump light and generated optical frequency harmonics .",
    "this frequency interval coincides with the frequency of the rf signal generated by demodulation of the frequency comb on a fast photodiode .",
    "we argue that this is not the case in practice , since modes of an optical resonator have slightly different q - factors .",
    "for instance , this difference is fundamental in the case of an evanescently coupled whispering gallery mode resonator .",
    "we consider a hyper - parametric oscillation process in which two monochromatic optical pump photons transform into two sideband photons mediated by the cubic nonlinearity of the ring resonator s host material .",
    "the oscillation is described by the kerr hamiltonian @xmath2 where `` @xmath3 '' stand for normal ordering , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the annihilation operators for the optically pumped and sideband modes , respectively ; @xmath7 is the coupling constant .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath7 can be derived using definition of the nonlinear refractive index : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the time - averaged intensity of the optical field within the resonator mode , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the linear and nonlinear refractive indices of the resonator host material . according to ( [ v ] ) , the power - dependent frequency shift of the optically pumped mode depends on the number of photons in the mode ( @xmath12 ) as @xmath13 . on the other hand , in accordance with ( [ n ] ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the frequency of the mode ) .",

    "it also predicts that the amplitude modulation of the pump light can be transferred with amplification to the power of the frequency comb if the modulation frequency corresponds with the relaxation oscillation resonance .",
    "it means that the amplitude noise of the pump laser can be efficiently imprinted on the amplitude noise of the rf signal generated by the optical frequency comb on a fast photodiode .",
    "we repeated the simulation for phase modulated pump light using identical parameters of the system .",

    "there is another parameter of the spectrum that results in the noise transfer .",
    "this parameter is related to high - order dispersion of the resonator modes .",
    "the high order dispersion is always present in the resonator due to dispersion of the resonator host material , which has nonlinear dispersion due to limited transparency bandwidth .",
    "the wavelength - dependent quality factor of the resonator spectrum also has to have certain correspondence with the dispersion , in accordance with the kramers - kronig relationship .    for the sake of clarity we neglect the wavelength dependence of the absorption and introduce a small third order dispersion ( tod ) to the resonator spectrum .",
    "the numerical simulations performed with this kind of resonator clearly show that the presence of a small tod results in noise transfer similar to what we observed with frequency dependent q - factor .",
    "we present results of the simulation for the ( broad ) kerr frequency comb only ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , since the results for hyper - parametric oscillation have similar behavior , as shown for the frequency dependent q - factor .     and @xmath122",

    ", width=226 ]      similarly to the case of wavelength dependent q - factor we observed two resonances at the transfer functions shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "one of the resonances corresponds to the relaxation oscillation and the other  to a feshbach resonance .",
    "we also observed a third resonance in the @xmath123 curve ( eq .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . to understand the nature of the resonance we repeated the simulation with different second - order gvd parameters . we found that the resonance shifts beyond the dynamic range of the simulation accuracy ( practically disappears ) for larger gvd values ( when we change @xmath105 to @xmath124 ) ; the relaxation oscillation resonance shifts to smaller frequencies , and the feshbach resonance changes its contrast , not the frequency , by a small amount ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the third resonance also disappears if we change the number of modes in the simulation .",
    "these observations show that the resonance is a consequence of the limited mode number we have considered .",
    "physically , the resonance can be interpreted as a feature occurring due to the presence of an additional filter function in the system , because the limited number of modes under consideration is equivalent to the presence of a square band - pass filter inserted in the nonlinear ring resonator .    , while sthe olid red line stands for @xmath105 .",
    "the other conditions are the same for both curves .",
    "resonance ( 1 ) corresponds to relaxation oscillation of the system and resonance ( 2 ) is the feshbach resonance .",
    ", width=264 ]",
    "our simulations show that while transfer of the optical pump amplitude noise to the noise of the fundamentally mode locked frequency comb is present in realistic nonlinear resonators , it is rather small .",
    "for instance , if a pump laser has rin of @xmath125  db@xmath72hz at 10  khz and the value of the am - to - pm transfer function is -75  db , the noise transfer can be safely neglected , since the best rf phase noise realized with a kerr frequency comb oscillator approaches @xmath126  dbc@xmath72hz at 10  khz @xcite ; that is much larger than -225  dbc / hz value resulting from the noise transfer .",
    "the same conclusion applies to higher offset frequencies .    the impact of the laser phase noise , however , can be more significant .",
    "for instance , if the phase noise of the pump laser is @xmath127  dbc@xmath72hz at 10  khz , which is a realistic value for a stabilized diode laser , and the pm - to - pm transfer function value is -80  db at 10  khz , the associated phase noise of the rf oscillator is limited by -130  dbc / hz at 10  khz .",
    "this number is already significant for high - quality rf photonic oscillators .",
    "the situation can become even worse if modes of the resonator interact .",
    "it was shown that mode interaction changes the frequency spacing ( gvd ) of the resonator modes rather significantly @xcite .",
    "the change can be so large that fundamental hyper - parametric oscillations with soft excitation take place in a resonator with small normal gvd .",
    "the mode interaction also destroys the symmetry of the mode q - factors , leading to several percent differences among q - factors of adjacent modes .",
    "it may result in five to six orders of magnitude increase in the noise transfer efficiency for both amplitude and phase noise .",
    "the highest effect of the noise transfer is expected in the vicinity of the relaxation oscillation peak ( the phase noise at smaller frequency is usually determined by thermal fluctuations of the resonator ) .",
    "if the phase noise arising from the detuning frequency noise of the laser and the resonator mode is -50  dbc / hz at 10  khz and the pm - to - pm transfer function flat part reaches -40  db , the resultant rf phase noise will be at the level of -90  dbc / hz , which is a large number for , e.g. , an rf kerr comb oscillator .",
    "another possibility for increased efficiency of the noise transfer occurs in multi - soliton combs , which have certain analogy with harmonic mode locking .",
    "those combs correspond to multiple optical pulses confined in the nonlinear resonator .",
    "in such a regime the power of the rf frequency signal generated by the comb on a fast photodiode is higher than in the case of the fundamentally mode locked comb .",
    "on the other hand , it was found that the sensitivity of the multi soliton combs to the modulation of the pump light is several orders of magnitude stronger than the sensitivity of the fundamentally mode locked comb discussed in this paper @xcite .",
    "therefore , to achieve highly spectrally pure rf signals generated in a photonic oscillator based on a kerr frequency comb , one needs to operate the device in the fundamentally mode locked regime and also use a pump laser with as low amplitude and phase noise as possible .",
    "we have analyzed the impact of the noise of continuous wave pump light on the noise of the rf signal generated by a kerr frequency comb based photonic oscillator . using both analytical and numerical simulations",
    "we have shown that the optical noise can be transferred to the comb noise in the case where the resonator spectrum has a certain asymmetry , such as nonzero third- and higher order dispersion and frequency - dependent quality factor .",
    "the noise transfer can already be significant at the current level of the technology and future experimental research is needed to further explore the impact of the optical pump noise in kerr frequency comb oscillators .",
