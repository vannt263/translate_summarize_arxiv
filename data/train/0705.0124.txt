    "phase modulation is a widely used technique for information transmission , and the performance of coded phase modulation has been of interest in the research community since the 1960s .",
    "one of the early works was conducted in @xcite where the capacity and error exponents of a continuous - phase modulated system , in which the transmitted phase can assume any value in @xmath2 , is studied .",
    "more recent studies include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "kaplan and shamai studied in @xcite the achievable information rates of differential phase - shift keying ( dpsk ) while reference @xcite investigated the capacity of @xmath1-ary psk over an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with unknown phase that stays constant for a block of symbols .",
    "pierce in @xcite considered hard - decision detection of psk signals trasmitted over the awgn channel and compared the performances of 2- , 3- and 4-phase modulations .",
    "pierce also provided in @xcite an expression for the bit energy required by @xmath1-ary psk at zero spectral efficiency .",
    "the authors in @xcite analyzed the spectral efficiency of coded psk and dpsk with soft- and hard - decision detection .",
    "reference @xcite analyzed the energy efficiency of psk when it is combined with on - off keying for transmission over noncoherent rician fading channels .",
    "recent work by zhang and laneman @xcite investigated the achievable rates of psk over noncoherent rayleigh fading channels with memory .",
    "the low - snr capacity of psk with soft detection is well - understood .",
    "for instance , verd @xcite has shown that quaternary psk ( qpsk ) transmission over the awgn or coherent fading channels is optimally efficient in the low - snr regime , achieving both the minimum bit energy of @xmath3 db and optimal wideband slope which is defined as the slope of the spectral efficiency curve at zero spectral efficiency .",
    "although soft detection gives the best performance , hard - decision detection and decoding is preferred when reduction in the computational burden is required @xcite .",
    "such a requirement , for instance , may be enforced in sensor networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , at very high transmission rates such as in fiber optic communications , obtaining multiple - bit resolution from a / d converters may not be possible @xcite . finally , it is of interest to understand the fundamental limits of hard - decision detection so that the performance gains of soft detection can be identified and weighed with its increased complexity requirements .",
    "motivated by these considerations and the fact that the performance difference of hard and soft detections are more emphasized at low power levels , we study in this paper the low - snr capacity of @xmath1-ary psk over both the awgn and fading channels when a hard - decision detection is employed at the receiver end .",
    "we consider the following channel model @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the discrete input , @xmath6 is the transmitted signal when the input is @xmath5 , and @xmath7 is the received signal during the the @xmath8 symbol duration .",
    "@xmath9 is the channel gain .",
    "@xmath9 is a fixed constant in unfaded awgn channels , while in flat fading channels , @xmath9 denotes the fading coefficient .",
    "@xmath10 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero - mean circularly symmetric gaussian random variables denoting the additive background noise .",
    "the variance of @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the system has an average power constraint of @xmath13 .    at the transmitter ,",
    "@xmath1-ary psk modulation is employed for transmission .",
    "hence , the discrete input , @xmath5 , takes values from @xmath14 , and if @xmath15 , then the transmitted signal in the @xmath8 symbol duration is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is one of the @xmath1 phases available in the constellation .    at the receiver ,",
    "the detector makes hard decisions for every received symbol .",
    "therefore , each received signal @xmath7 is mapped to one of the points in the constellation set @xmath18 before the decoding step .",
    "we assume that maximum likelihood decision rule is used at the detector .",
    "note that with hard - decision detection , the channel can be now regarded as a symmetric discrete channel with @xmath1 inputs and @xmath1 outputs .",
    "we first consider the unfaded awgn channel and assume that @xmath19 . in this case , the conditional probability density function of the channel output given the channel input is in the equations for the sake of simplification . ]",
    "@xmath20 it is well - known that the maximum likelihood detector selects the constellation point closest to the received signal @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the signal at the output of the detector by @xmath22 and assume that @xmath23 note that @xmath24 for @xmath25 means that the detected signal is @xmath26 .",
    "the decision region for @xmath24 is the two - dimensional region @xmath27 with quantization at the receiver , the resulting channel is a symmetric , discrete , memoryless channel with input @xmath28 and output @xmath29 .",
    "the transition probabilities are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the conditional probability density function of the phase of the received signal given that the input is @xmath32 , and hence the transmitted signal is @xmath33 .",
    "it is well - known that the capacity of this symmetric channel is achieved by equiprobable inputs and the resulting capacity expression @xcite is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the entropy function , and @xmath37 . in order to evaluate the capacity of general @xmath1-ary psk transmission with a hard - decision detector ,",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath38 should be computed .",
    "starting from ( [ eq : condprobr ] ) , we can easily find that @xmath39 where @xmath40 since @xmath41 is rather complicated , closed - form expressions for the capacity is available only for the special cases of @xmath42 and 4 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 . for the other cases , the channel capacity can only be found by numerical computation .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of the capacity in the low-@xmath0 regime can be accurately predicted through the second - order taylor series expansion of the capacity , which involves @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the first and second derivatives of the channel capacity ( in nats / symbol ) with respect to @xmath0 at @xmath47 . in the following result",
    ", we provide closed - form expressions for these derivatives .",
    "[ theo : awgnderivatives ] the first and second derivatives of @xmath48 in nats per symbol at @xmath47 are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , where @xmath51    _ proof _ : the main approach is to obtain @xmath45 and @xmath46 by first finding the derivatives of the transition probabilities @xmath38 .",
    "this can be accomplished by finding the first and second derivatives of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "however , the presence of @xmath52 in second part of ( [ eq : condprobtheta ] ) complicates this approach because @xmath53 in order to circumvent this problem , we define the new variable @xmath54 and consider @xmath55 the following can be easily verified . @xmath56 using the above derivatives , we can find the first through fourth derivatives of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "using the derivatives of @xmath57 and performing several algebraic operations , we arrive to the following taylor expansion for @xmath60 at @xmath59 : @xmath61 where ( [ eq : expansion2 ] ) follows due to the fact that @xmath54 . in the above expansion , @xmath62 and @xmath63 we",
    "immediately conclude from ( [ eq : expansion2 ] ) that @xmath64 .",
    "note that the expansion includes the term @xmath65 which implies that @xmath66 for all @xmath1 .",
    "however , it can be easily seen that @xmath67 for all @xmath68 , and at @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , while @xmath71 , @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "further algebraic steps and simplification yields ( [ eq : firstderivative ] ) and ( [ eq : secondderivative ] ) .",
    "_ remark : _ we should note that the first derivative expression ( [ eq : firstderivative ] ) has previously been given in @xcite through the bit energy expressions .",
    "in addition , verd in @xcite has provided the second derivative expression for the special case of @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the main novelty in theorem [ theo : awgnderivatives ] is the second derivative expression for general @xmath1 .",
    "first and second derivative expressions are given together for completeness .",
    "the following corollary provides the asymptotic behavior as @xmath76 .    in the limit as @xmath77 ,",
    "the first and second derivatives of the capacity at zero @xmath0 converge to @xmath78    in the low - power regime , the tradeoff between bit energy and spectral efficiency is a key measure of performance .",
    "the normalized energy per bit can be obtained from @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the channel capacity in bits / symbol .",
    "the maximum achievable spectral efficiency in bits / s / hz is given by @xmath81 if we , without loss of generality , assume that one symbol occupies a 1s @xmath82 1hz time - frequency slot .",
    "two important notions regarding the spectral - efficiency / bit - energy tradeoff in the low power regime are the bit - energy required at zero spectral efficiency , @xmath83 and the wideband slope , @xmath84 which gives the slope of the spectral efficiency curve @xmath85 at zero spectral efficiency @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 and @xmath87 constitute a linear approximation to the spectral efficiency curve in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "since these quantities depend only @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the bit energy at zero spectral efficiency and wideband slope achieved by @xmath1-ary psk signals with a hard - decision detector can be readily obtained by using the formulas ( [ eq : firstderivative ] ) and ( [ eq : secondderivative ] ) .    the bit energy at zero spectral efficiency and wideband slope achieved by @xmath1-ary psk signaling are given by @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .    as it will be evident in numerical results ,",
    "generally the @xmath86 is the minimum bit energy required for reliable transmission when @xmath68 .",
    "however , for @xmath92 , the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero spectral efficiency .    for 3-psk modulation ,",
    "the minimum bit energy is achieved at a nonzero spectral efficiency .",
    "this corollary follows immediately from the fact that @xmath93 which implies that the slope at zero @xmath0 of @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "this lets us conclude that the bit energy required at zero spectral efficiency can not be the minimum one .",
    "the fact that 3-psk achieves its minimum bit energy at a nonzero spectral efficiency is also pointed out in @xcite through numerical results . here , this result is shown analytically through the second derivative expression .",
    "figure [ fig : awgnbitenergy ] plots the spectral efficiency curves as a function of the bit energy for hard - detected psk with different constellation sizes .",
    "as observed in this figure , the information - theoretic analysis conducted in this paper provides several practical design guidelines .",
    "we note that although 2-psk and 4-psk achieve the same minimum bit energy of 0.369 db at zero spectral efficiency , 4-psk is more efficient at low but nonzero spectral efficiency values due to its wideband slope being twice that of 2-psk .",
    "3-psk is better than 2-psk for spectral efficiency values greater than 0.208 bits / s / hz below which 3-psk performes worse than both 2 and 4-psk .",
    "3-psk achieves its minimum bit energy of 0.8383 db at 0.124 bits / s / hz .",
    "operation below this level of spectral efficiency should be avoided as it only increases the energy requirements .",
    "we further observe that increasing the constellation size to 8 provides much improvement over 4-psk .",
    "8-psk achieves a minimum bit energy of @xmath96 db .",
    "further increase in @xmath1 provides diminishing returns .",
    "for instance , there is little to be gained by increasing the constellation size more than 32 as 32-psk achieves a minimum bit energy of @xmath97 db and the minimum bit energy as @xmath77 is @xmath98 db . note that @xmath98 db still presents a loss of approximately 1.05 db with respect to the fundamental limit of @xmath3 db achieved by soft detection .",
    "we find that the wideband slopes of m = 8,10,16,32 , and 1024 are 2.44 , 2.53 , 2.64 , 2.69 , and 2.71 .",
    "the similarity of the wideband slope values is also apparent in the figure . as @xmath77 ,",
    "the wideband slope is 2.717 .",
    "finally , note that the wideband slope of 3-psk , as predicted , is 0 .",
    "in this section , we consider fading channels and assume that the fading coefficients @xmath99 are known at the receiver but not at the transmitter .",
    "the only requirements on the fading coefficients are that their variations are ergodic and they have finite second moments . due to the presence of receiver channel side information ( csi ) , scaled nearest point detection is employed , and the analysis follows along lines similar to those in the previous section .",
    "hence , the treatment will be brief .",
    "note that in this case , the average capacity is @xmath100 where @xmath101 with @xmath102 . through a similar analysis as in section [ sec : awgn ] , we have the following result on the derivatives of the capacity .",
    "note that the first derivative and second derivatives of the capacity at zero @xmath0 are essentially equal to the scaled versions of those obtained in the awgn channel .",
    "the scale factors are @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the first and second derivatives , respectively .    in the fading case",
    ", we can define the received bit energy as @xmath108 as @xmath109 is the received signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "it immediately follows from theorem [ theo : cfderivatives ] that @xmath110 in the coherent fading channel is the same as that in the awgn channel . on the other hand ,",
    "the wideband slope is scaled by @xmath111 .      in this section",
    ", we assume that neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the fading coefficients @xmath99 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath99 are i.i.d .",
    "proper complex gaussian random variables with mean @xmath112 is required because phase can not be used to transmit information in a noncoherent rayleigh fading channel where @xmath113 . ] and variance @xmath114 .",
    "now , the conditional probability density function of the channel output given the input is @xmath115 recall that @xmath116 are the psk signals and hence @xmath117 for all @xmath118 . due to this constant magnitude property",
    ", it can be easily shown that the maximum likelihood detector selects @xmath119 as the transmitted signal if ) is obtained when we assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath120 . ]",
    "@xmath121 where @xmath122 is the complex conjugate of @xmath119 , and @xmath123 denotes the operation that selects the real part .",
    "therefore , the decision regions are the same as in the awgn channel case .",
    "the received bit energy at zero spectral efficiency and wideband slope achieved by @xmath1-ary psk signaling are given by @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively , where @xmath105 is given in ( [ eq : psi ] ) , and @xmath134 is the rician factor .",
    "[ fig : ncfadingbitenergy ] plots the spectral efficiency curves as a function of the bit energy for @xmath1-ary psk transmission over the noncoherent rician fading channel with @xmath138 .",
    "note that conclusions similar to those given for fig .",
    "[ fig : awgnbitenergy ] also apply for fig .",
    "[ fig : ncfadingbitenergy ] .",
    "the main difference between the figures is the substantial increase in the bit energy values as a penalty of not knowing the channel .",
    "for instance , 2 and 4-psk now achieves a minimum bit energy of 3.379 db while 8-psk attains 2.692 db . as @xmath77 ,",
