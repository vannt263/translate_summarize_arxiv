    "this matching fraction is significantly higher than was reported with 221.9  ks ( paper  ii ) but comparable to that found within the smaller region with 479.7  ks ( paper  iv ) .",
    "the overlap between the x - ray- and radio - detected samples is shown in figure  [ fig : x_vs_r ] , with the dashed lines indicating constant ratios of x - ray - to - radio flux , @xmath44 .. ] we characterize the sources in terms of their full - band x - ray fluxes , rather than their soft- or hard - band fluxes as has traditionally been done in the past , because ( 1 ) the vast majority of the sources in the x - ray sample are detected in the full band ( 94% versus 81% in the soft band and 66% in the hard band ) and ( 2 ) the full band more effectively separates obscured agn from `` normal '' galaxies , especially when combined with optical magnitude information , since it incorporates both soft- and hard - band x - ray fluxes .",
    "for instance , a galaxy and a moderately - obscured agn could potentially have comparable soft - band x - ray fluxes , but because        of their different spectral slopes ( typically @xmath45 versus 1.0 , respectively ) , the obscured agn will have a much larger full - band flux and be easily identified .",
    "we have adopted the source classification scheme presented in paper  xi with the exception that we further use the radio properties of the sources to identify agn activity .",
    "this scheme is pivotal to all that follows and is thus repeated here . since nearly all of the sources with @xmath46 have spectroscopic redshifts and classifications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sources were classified into three loose spectral types : emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) , and absorption - line galaxies ( algs ) , and agn - dominated sources .",
    "these categories are intended to identify qualitatively the bulk of the optical emission from a particular galaxy as either from active star formation , passively evolving stars , or agn activity .",
    "note , however , that in classifying the sources as elgs and algs , we have ignored some of the subtleties of the optical spectral types  such as whether the emission - line spectra have -like emission lines indicative of active star formation or exhibit only a weak @xmath473727 doublet  since the spectra remain largely unpublished",
    ". thus we caution that spectral misclassifications are possible for some sources .",
    "we classified sources as elgs if they have optical spectral classifications of `` e '' , `` i '' , `` ei '' or `` ea '' in @xcite . likewise , we classified sources as algs if they have a classification of `` a '' in @xcite .",
    "agn - dominated sources were identified based on one of the following criteria : a spectroscopic identification as a broad - line agn ( i.e. , a ",
    "spectral type from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a rest - frame 0.58.0  kev luminosity @xmath48  , an effective x - ray photon index @xmath49 ( indicative of obscured agn ) , or radio properties indicative of agn ( i.e. , spectral indices @xmath50@xmath51 , radio jets / lobes , or variability ; r98 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , hereafter r99 ; r00 ) .",
    "any elgs or algs that were determined to contain agn were classed as agn - dominated .",

    "[ fig : x_vs_r ] , optical spectral types are represented by the letters `` e '' for elgs , `` a '' for algs , `` q '' for broad - line agn , and `` ? '' if the spectral type remains unknown , while agn - dominated sources are indicated by large crosses .",
    "since the ratio of x - ray - to - radio flux found for classical agn can span _ several _ orders of magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* fig . 4.10 ) , it is not surprising to see such a large spread among the agn in figure  [ fig : x_vs_r ] [ @xmath526 ] .",
    "less stringent agn activity constraints can be placed on the fainter x - ray and radio sources because of their low signal - to - noise and some are therefore likely to host low - luminosity agn .",
    "we note , however , that the large number of x - ray / radio matched elgs at faint x - ray fluxes and radio flux densities is consistent with the emergence of a `` normal , '' star - forming galaxy population at moderate redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; r98 ; paper  ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , there appears to be a steep rise in the number of radio matches to x - ray sources near the limit of the 1.4  ghz survey , suggesting that slightly deeper radio observations may detect several of the remaining x - ray sources .",
    "the ubiquity of star formation within these x - ray / radio matched sources is most clearly demonstrated by comparing        the 1.48.5  ghz radio spectral index to the 1.4  ghz flux density , as shown in figure  [ fig : r_vs_ar ] . plotted",
    "are radio sources detected at either 1.4 or 8.5  ghz in the x - ray and radio samples , along with the agn classifications outlined above ( _ crosses _ ) and the radio classifications from r99 ( _ letters _ ) .",
    "these radio classifications  starburst - type sources ( s ) , agn candidates ( a ) , and sources that could not be easily classified ( referred to as unknown , or u )  are based primarily on radio spectral indices , morphologies , and angular sizes , but they also take into account optical and ir properties in some cases ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the radio classifications are intended to identify qualitatively the origin of the bulk of the radio emission from a particular galaxy and do not preclude the possibility of starburst - type sources having embedded agn or agn - type sources having stellar activity . when possible we have used the matched radio spectral indices provided in table  1 of r99 , where the 1.4  ghz and 8.5  ghz flux densities used to calculate",
    "the spectral indices were measured in their respective 35 convolved images . for the remaining sources",
    " i.e. , those with 3@xmath24 detections at either 1.4  ghz or 8.5  ghz  we have estimated the spectral indices using the publicly available radio images ; these lower significance estimates are noted in tables  [ tab : xray - sources ] and [ tab : radio - sources ] and should be treated as approximate since the images used to measure the fluxes were not matched in resolution .",
    "we also caution that variability among the radio agn is a legitimate concern and could lead to inaccurate spectral index estimates since the two radio bands were observed two years apart .",
    "a horizontal dashed line denotes the typical spectral index , @xmath53 , separating steep and flat spectrum radio sources .",
    "steep spectral indices ( @xmath54 ) often indicate radio emission from star formation , while flat ones ( @xmath55 ) often indicate emission from core - dominated agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "within our sample area , there are 16 starburst - type , 3 agn - type , and 17 unknown - type sources .",
    "as expected , nearly all of the x - ray - detected non - agn sources are classified as starburst - type sources at radio wavelengths .",
    "conversely , only approximately half of the x - ray / radio matched agn are classified as agn - type sources at radio wavelengths , suggesting that star formation activity is important in many of these agn .    to explore further the nature of the x - ray and radio - selected samples ,",
    "we compare the distribution of full - band x - ray flux to @xmath28-band magnitude ( see figure  [ fig : x_vs_i - radio ] ) .",
    "because of the empirical relationship between x - ray and optical emission in agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this diagram highlights the degree and nature of any agn activity . in the x - ray - optical plane ,",
    "classical agn typically have flux ratios of @xmath56 , while star - forming galaxies and low - luminosity agn tend to have @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; paper  ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "these regions have been shaded and labeled for emphasis .",
    "we caution that although star formation generally appears to be the dominant emission mechanism for x - ray sources with @xmath57 ( e.g. , paper  ii , paper  xi ) , x - ray emission from low - luminosity or heavily obscured agn can not be individually ruled out .    at first glance",
    ", the connection between x - ray and radio sources appears to be rather complex , as x - ray / radio matched counterparts ( filled circles ) span @xmath583 decades in both x - ray flux and optical magnitude .",
    "however , taking cues from the x - ray / ir matched sources of paper  xi , we notice a few interesting trends .",
    "first , the majority of the x - ray / radio matched sources that fall within the `` galaxies '' region of figure  [ fig : x_vs_i - radio ]        [ i.e. , @xmath57 ] have ir counterparts ( large concentric squares ) and are spectroscopically identified as elgs , compared to relatively few in the agn region .",
    "as such , these sources appear to be distinct from the typical x - ray emitting agn .",
    "the ir emission and elg spectral types suggest that the x - ray emission in these sources is likely to be associated with active star - forming processes ( paper  xi ) .",
    "second , while there is no obvious division within the agn population [ i.e. , @xmath60 , an observational division occurs around @xmath61 .",
    "the optically bright x - ray / radio matches tend to be spectroscopically identified as galaxies or broad - line agn with @xmath62 , while the optically fainter ones remain largely unclassified and perhaps comprise several different classes of object ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  vi ) .",
    "thus we divide the x - ray / radio matches into three basic categories : galaxies , optically bright ( @xmath63 ) agn , and optically faint ( @xmath64 ) sources ( see figure  [ fig : x_vs_i - radio ] , as well as column  12 of table  [ tab : xray - sources ] and column  13 of table  [ tab : radio - sources ] ) .",
    "the three source types are highlighted in figure  [ fig : x_vs_i - radio ] by the colors red , green , and blue , respectively .",
    "below we provide constraints on the basic nature of the sources in the `` galaxies '' , `` optically bright agn '' , and `` optically faint sources '' categories .",
    "the `` galaxies '' sample includes 21 x - ray sources that lie within the @xmath57 region of figure  [ fig : x_vs_i - radio ] and a further six sources that lie slightly above @xmath65 ; the latter sources are included since they share many characteristics with the former ( these six sources are noted in table  [ tab : xray - sources ] ) .",
    "all but two of the 27 objects have x - ray luminosities below @xmath66  .",
    "fifteen of the 27 ( 56% ) sources in the x - ray sample have radio counterparts , while 15 of the 18 ( 83% ) sources in the radio sample have x - ray counterparts .",
    "thus , it appears that the 40  @xmath1jy vla survey at 1.4  ghz is extremely well - matched to the 1  ms _ chandra _ observation for the detection of galaxies .",
    "in the nearby universe , connections between x - ray , ir , and radio emission appear to split along evolutionary lines , with the strongest correlations arising from galaxies with active star formation , such as late - type spirals and irregulars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a similar trend emerges in the at moderate redshifts ( @xmath671.3 ) for luminous ir starbursts and x - ray faint galaxies , as evidenced by the findings of paper  xi .",
    "x - ray faint galaxies with ir counterparts are predominantly identified spectroscopically as elgs and exhibit no apparent x - ray / radio agn activity , while those without ir counterparts are primarily algs and exhibit low - to - moderate level x - ray / radio agn activity in roughly half of the cases . since the elgs and algs exhibit different properties",
    ", they are investigated separately below .",
    "we have assumed that the three `` galaxies '' sources which remain unclassified ( i.e. , sources with a `` ? '' ) are algs .",
    "these three objects were observed spectroscopically but the signal - to - noise of their spectra are too low to derive useful spectral types or redshifts . given the optical magnitudes of the three sources , any strong emission lines would have been detected , implying that all three probably have absorption - line dominated continua .",
    "we find that 12 out of 18 ( 67% ) x - ray - detected elgs have radio counterparts , while 12 out of 14 ( 86% ) radio - detected elgs have x - ray counterparts .",
    "these matching fractions appear to corroborate the x - ray / ir trend found in paper  xi .",
    "optically , all of the x - ray / radio matched elgs reside within bright , extended galaxies and , when high - resolution , archival _ hst _ flanking field observations are available , have spiral , irregular , or merging morphologies . as shown in @xmath11[properties ] , the radio emission from the majority of the x - ray / radio matched elgs sources is indicative of star formation and yields an average radio spectral slope of @xmath68 . in terms of their x - ray emission , however , the spectral constraints for individual sources are poor .",
    "we can , however , place good constraints on the nature of the x - ray emission from these elgs in an average sense . when stacked together ,",
    "the x - ray / radio detected elgs have an average x - ray band ratio of @xmath69 ( corresponding to @xmath70 ) .",
    "this shows that the fraction of hidden agn in these sources is low , similar to the findings of paper  xi for x - ray / ir elgs , and that the radio and x - ray emission are more consistent with active star formation from normal galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , the luminosities of the x - ray / radio matched elgs span the range expected from @xmath71 normal spiral systems up to powerful @xmath72 starbursts ( i.e. , @xmath73@xmath74 w  hz@xmath13 and @xmath75@xmath76 ) .",
    "the elgs are discussed further in @xmath11[discussion ] .",
    "we find that three of the nine ( 33% ) x - ray - detected algs have radio counterparts , while three of the four ( 75% ) radio - detected algs have x - ray counterparts .",
    "in contrast to the elgs , the algs have predominantly elliptical or s0 morphologies .",
    "interestingly , only one of the x - ray - detected algs is clearly an agn at x - ray energies , although another two are identified as agn at radio wavelengths .",

    "we can , however , gain some insight into their nature by stacking their x - ray emission .",
    "the average x - ray band ratio of the three x - ray / radio algs is @xmath77 ( corresponding to @xmath78 ) and is similar to that for the x - ray / radio elgs . by comparison , the average band ratio of the x - ray - detected algs that lack radio counterparts is @xmath79 ( corresponding to @xmath80 ) , implying the possibility of different x - ray emission mechanisms at work .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the three x - ray / radio matched algs are comparable to the most luminous galaxies in the elg sample ( i.e. , @xmath81@xmath76 ) , and they are generally more luminous than the x - ray - detected algs that lack radio counterparts ( i.e. , @xmath82@xmath83 ) . such a correspondence between x - ray and radio emission mechanisms might be expected from compact low - luminosity agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or radio jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but not from stellar processes . unfortunately , we can not confirm the origin of the x - ray emission in these algs with the current x - ray data .",

    "taken together , the x - ray , optical , and radio properties suggest that ( 1 ) obagn with starburst - like optical and radio properties make up a sizable minority of the population and ( 2 ) such sources tend to be more highly obscured at optical and radio wavelengths compared to other types of obagn . at low redshifts ,",
    "the star formation activity from such sources , sometimes called `` x - ray - loud composite galaxies , '' is often found to be circumnuclear in nature ( perhaps as close as @xmath10100  pc from the central engine ) and it is thought to be directly responsible for the absorption seen at x - ray energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while we lack the x - ray and radio spatial resolution needed to address this properly , our findings are at least consistent with such a scenario .    finally , starburst - obscured agn have been postulated to be important contributors to the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) , possibly outnumbering brighter unobscured agn by 100 to 1 @xcite .",

    "however , the relative number of starburst - obscured obagn is clearly much smaller than predicted , indicating that either the majority of the presumed starburst - obscured agn population lies at fainter optical magnitudes and presumably higher redshifts ( see @xmath11[opt_faint ] ) or that the overall spectral `` hardening '' of the extragalactic x - ray background ( xrb ) is produced by a different mechanism altogether .      due to the optical magnitudes of the optically faint ( @xmath64 ) x - ray and radio sources ( ofxs and ofrs ) ,",
    "their nature remains mostly uncertain .",
    "the best available constraints on these sources to date suggest that they are comprised of luminous dust - enshrouded starburst galaxies and luminous obscured agn at @xmath92@xmath93 , and perhaps a few extreme redshift ( @xmath94 ) agn .",
    "we find that seven of the 23 ( 30% ) ofxs have radio counterparts , while seven of the 12 ( 58% ) ofrs have x - ray counterparts .",
    "three of the radio - detected ofxs have x - ray spectral slope constraints that are quite hard ( vla  j123651@xmath30621221 , vla  j123707@xmath30621408 , and vla  j123711@xmath30621325 ; see table  [ tab : xray - sources ] ) and imply obscured agn activity , while the x - ray spectral slope of a fourth radio - detected ofx ( vla  123655.8@xmath30621201 ) is ambiguous .",

    "this ratio is significantly different from that found for both the bright radio - detected ofxs and the ofx population overall ( @xmath97 , or equivalently @xmath98 ; see also paper  vi ) , and it suggests that the origin of the x - ray emission in the faintest radio - detected ofxs may be due to star formation or seyfert - luminosity , unobscured agn .",
    "interestingly , the radio spectral indices , classifications , and luminosity density ranges ( assuming @xmath92@xmath93 ) for five of the seven radio - detected ofxs ( or 15% of all ofxs ) suggest that star formation activity is likely to dominate the 1.4  ghz emission .",

    "we can not completely rule out the @xcite model , however , since several of the remaining x - ray - detected agn could still host weak ( i.e. @xmath100 ) starbursts .    the x - ray / radio matched elgs are particularly important from a cosmological standpoint , as they comprise @xmath2  35% of the x - ray source population below x - ray fluxes of @xmath101  and further mark the emergence of a population of star - forming galaxies discovered in previous x - ray studies ( e.g. , paper  ii ; paper  iv ; paper  xi ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we further investigate below the properties of this faint x - ray source population .",
    "radio emission , because of its tight linear relationship with fir emission and its relatively short lifetime due to electron diffusion , is often used as an estimator of the recent star formation rate ( sfr ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to determine whether the x - ray emission can likewise be used as an indicator of the sfr , we compare the @xmath102-corrected full - band x - ray luminosities and 1.4  ghz radio luminosity densities of the cdf - n elgs in figure  [ fig : lx_vs_lr ] .",
    "the rest - frame x - ray luminosities of the sources are calculated as    @xmath103    and the rest - frame radio luminosity densities as    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the luminosity distance ( cm ) , @xmath106 is the x - ray flux ( erg  @xmath17  s@xmath13 ) , @xmath107 corresponds to the photon index , @xmath108 is the 1.4  ghz flux density ( @xmath1jy ) , and @xmath38 corresponds to the radio spectral index ( see tables  [ tab : xray - sources ] and [ tab : radio - sources ] ) .",
    "we used the actual measured @xmath107 and @xmath38 values for the @xmath102-corrections to the cdf - n elgs when available , or @xmath109 and @xmath37 otherwise . at the redshifts of the sources ( @xmath110 ) , the typical @xmath102-corrections are not large .",
    "since the majority of the elgs have upper limits at either x - ray or radio wavelengths , we need to use survival analysis techniques to account properly for the many upper limits when searching for a correlation ; we employ the asurv statistical package ( v1.2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implements the methods presented in @xcite and @xcite for censored datasets .    among the 20 cdf - n elgs ,",
    "six have x - ray upper limits and six have radio upper limits .",
    "to establish whether a significant correlation exists between the x - ray and radio emission , we used the generalized kendall s tau , as it is most applicable for censored datasets with a small number of points ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) .",
    "the x - ray and radio emission in elgs are found to be correlated at an @xmath112 significance level . to counter the sparse sampling of the cdf - n elgs at low luminosities , we also consider the 102 nearby late - type galaxies ( i.e. , non - agn sources        with @xmath113  ) from the multi - wavelength study of ( * ? ? ?",

    "the luminosities of the @xcite late - type galaxy sample have been converted to the bands shown in figure  [ fig : lx_vs_lr ] assuming spectral slopes of @xmath109 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "use of the entire 122 galaxy sample dramatically improves the likelihood of an x - ray / radio correlation to an @xmath114 significance level .    in the presence of upper limits in both variables ,",
    "the two most appropriate regression techniques are the theil - sen @xcite and schmitt @xcite methods .",
    "we have chosen to employ the theil - sen bisector regression method since it does not require ( subjective ) binning like schmitt s method , and we use schmitt s method only to confirm our results . the theil - sen bisector regression analysis for the 122 galaxies",
    "yields the following relationship between the x - ray luminosity and radio luminosity density : @xmath115 schmitt s bisector regression method yields nearly identical results ( i.e. , a slope of @xmath116 ) , but it has larger associated uncertainties .    the x - ray / radio correlation above is consistent with the local x - ray / radio correlations found both for the @xcite sample of late - type galaxies alone and for a sample of nearby star - forming systems ( i.e. , sources with optical  nuclei  from the sample of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ @xcite .",
    "the good agreement between the local correlations and the one determined above suggests that either ( 1 ) there is relatively little evolution in the x - ray and radio emission of elgs between @xmath117@xmath118 , or ( 2 ) the x - ray and radio emission evolve together both in magnitude and on similar timescales .",
    "we further caution that the nearly linear relationship between x - ray and radio emission found in equation  [ eq : lx_lr ] may not hold for x - ray luminosities below @xmath119  where the data are sparse .",
    "for instance , ( 1 ) lmxbs in globular clusters would have no equivalent long - lasting radio component and therefore cause the x - ray emission to saturate while the radio emission continued to decrease , or ( 2 ) the relationship between x - ray emission and sfr may not be linearly proportional for the population of x - ray binaries emitting at sub - eddington x - ray luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the physical interpretation of this correlation is complex , as a variety of emission mechanisms could contribute to the x - ray and radio emission . in local starburst galaxies ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at x - ray energies",
    "the emission is produced by high - mass x - ray binaries and extended hot gas ( @xmath120  kev ) , which are both attributed to recent star formation , and low - mass x - ray binaries which trace older star formation ; see , e.g. , the review by @xcite . as the majority of the elgs lie at @xmath1211.3 , their observed x - ray fluxes should be dominated by emission from hmxbs and lmxbs ( i.e. , emission from point sources rather than extended hot gas ) .",
    "the majority of the @xcite sample , however , lie below @xmath122 , and thus their observed x - ray fluxes may have contributions from hot gas .",
    "globally , a link between the x - ray and radio emission seems plausible , given that both are tied to the evolution of massive stars .",
    "however , on an individual hmxb / snr basis this link remains quite difficult to test , as these two facets of massive star formation are temporally distinct .",
    "the most significant progress on the interpretation of this correlation will be from extensive _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ studies of our own galaxy and nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "one interesting application of equation  [ eq : lx_lr ] is that we can now use the x - ray emission to determine sfrs for elgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "equation  13 of @xcite gives the relationship between the rest - frame radio luminosity density and sfr , @xmath123 substituting equation  [ eq : lx_lr ] into the above , we obtain @xmath124    the implied sfrs found for the x - ray - detected elgs are @xmath10  0.2450  @xmath125 .",
    "similar rates are found using the associated ir emission from many of the x - ray / radio elgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , it appears that the x - ray and radio emission from elgs may be better matched than either one is to the 15@xmath1 m emission .",
    "this result is somewhat counter to that expected assuming , e.g. , the fir / radio correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we further indicate whether it was detected at x - ray energies ( this includes both normal and lower significance detections ) .",
    "we first note that up to 100% of the radio - detected elgs have 15@xmath1 m counterparts , suggesting that the fir / radio relationship extends to mir wavelengths and moderate redshifts ( a trait previously noted by * ? ? ? * and ; * ? ? ?",
    "a dashed line denotes the theil - sen bisector regression fit to the 15@xmath1m / radio matched elgs .",
    "as found in paper  xi , the majority of the 15@xmath1m - detected elgs with radio counterparts also have x - ray counterparts , while most of the 15@xmath1m - detected elgs without radio counterparts do not .",
    "moreover , most of the 15@xmath1m - detected elgs with radio upper limits lie to the 15@xmath1 m bright side of the regression .",
    "these two facts suggest an intrinsic bimodality in the 15@xmath1m - detected elgs .",
    "we can quantify this bimodality statistically by comparing the 15@xmath1m - to - radio luminosity ratio ( i.e. reducing the dimensionality of the problem to single quantity ) , and then testing for whether the x - ray - detected distribution differs from the x - ray - undetected one using the kaplan - meier ( km ) test within asurv to account for the numerous radio upper limits .",
    "the result of the km test indicates that the distributions have a @xmath130 probability of coming from the same parent distribution . and",
    "since the majority of the x - ray - undetected 15@xmath1 m elgs have radio luminosity density upper limits , this difference could be even stronger .",
    "the most likely explanation for such a dichotomy is that the 15@xmath1m - detected elgs with x - ray counterparts have significantly different mir spectral energy distributions from those without them . to still be consistent with the fir / radio correlation",
    ", these x - ray - undetected elgs would have to have substantially warmer mir / fir colors than m82 ( i.e. , the spectral template used to @xmath102-correct our 15@xmath1 m luminosities ) . an enhancement to the mir flux could be explained by either a hotter dust component or stronger emission - line features ( e.g. , pah features ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as compared to m82 . because a hotter dust component requires more high energy photons ( i.e. , more x - ray emission ) , however , we might expect enhanced x - ray emission rather than a lack of it .",
    "thus , the most likely explanation for the 15@xmath1m - detected elgs without x - ray counterparts is that they have significantly stronger emission - line features than those with x - ray counterparts .",

    "<S> we find that @xmath242% of the 62 x - ray sources have radio counterparts and @xmath271% of the 28 radio sources have x - ray counterparts ; thus a 40  @xmath1jy vla survey at 1.4  ghz appears to be well - matched to a 1  ms _ chandra _ observation . among the different source populations sampled , we find that the majority of the 18 x - ray detected emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) have radio and mid - infrared _ isocam _ counterparts and appear to be luminous star - forming galaxies at @xmath31.3 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the radio - detected elgs make up @xmath235% of the x - ray source population at 0.58.0  kev x - ray fluxes between @xmath4@xmath5  and signal the emergence of the luminous , high-@xmath6 starburst galaxy population in the x - ray band . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the locally - determined correlation between x - ray luminosities and 1.4  ghz radio luminosity densities of the late - type galaxies can easily be extended to include the luminous intermediate - redshift elgs , suggesting that the x - ray and radio emission processes are generally associated in star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that the x - ray emission can be used as an indicator of star formation rate for star - forming galaxies . </S>",

    "<S> the latter type may have stronger mid - infrared emission - line features that increase their detectability at mid - infrared wavelengths . </S>"
