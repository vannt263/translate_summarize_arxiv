    "lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies are characterised by the presence of a central bulge and disk and the absence of spiral arms .",
    "multiwavelength observations over the decades have not led to any broad consensus about their origins , properties , and evolution , although they are often thought to have formed most of their stars early in the history of the universe and to have evolved relatively passively since then .",
    "cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a `` two - phase '' character for galaxy formation with a rapid early phase at @xmath4 during which `` in situ '' stars are formed within the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase since @xmath5 during which `` ex situ '' stars are primarily accreted ( oser et  al .",
    "2010 ) . in the widely accepted paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation , major mergers play an important role in the galaxy formation process for early type galaxies . in this picture",
    ", current theory predicts that stellar evolution returns substantial quantities of gas to the interstellar medium ; most is ejected from the galaxy , but significant amounts of cool gas might be retained ( abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; kormendy & bender 2012 ; eliche - moral et  al .",
    "this simple picture is complicated by the need to properly account for the distribution of merger orbital parameters , gas fractions , and the full efficiency of merger - induced effects as a function of mass ratio of the merging galaxies ( hopkins et  al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the remaining gas may form new stars at different epochs over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "such star formation is however , too weak to affect the optical light of the galaxy , which continues to be dominated by the old stellar population and appears \" red and dead  in optical imaging and spectroscopy ( e.g. , bothun & gregg ( 1990 ) ; schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) ; munn ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "s0 galaxies occupy an important position in hubble s tuning fork diagram ( hubble 1936 ) , where they are placed in between ellipticals and spirals implying that s0 galaxies have properties that are intermediate between these two classes . although the view that they are relatively gas - poor still survives ( e.g. , tomita et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) , it has become clear that in general 75% - 80% of them have some dust and gas ( e.g. , knapp , turner & cunniffe ( 1985 ) ; wardle & knapp ( 1986 ) ; van dokkum & franx ( 1995 ) ; ferrari et  al . ( 1999 ) ; welch & sage ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "these differences in neutral and molecular gas content and gas supply are an essential factor to explain the differences in galaxy formation and evolution scenarios between different morphologies of galaxies .",
    "hi , fir and co observation of s0 galaxies have demonstrated that many of these objects have an active and cold interstellar medium though usually in much smaller quantities compared to spirals .",
    "balick , faber & gallagher ( 1976 ) first reported the discovery of atomic hydrogen in s0 galaxies .",
    "van driel & van woerden ( 1991 ) observed distributions and kinematics of hi gas in gas - rich s0 galaxies to study various scenarios for the origin and evolution of gas in such galaxies .",
    "co emission from molecular gas was detected in 78% of field s0 galaxies in the survey by welch & sage ( 2003 ) .",
    "nearly 60% of nearby s0 galaxies were detected by iras in its 60 @xmath6 m and 100 @xmath6 m ( knapp et  al . 1989 ) bands indicating the presence of dust .",
    "gas , dust and small amount of star formation were detected by temi , brighenti & mathews ( 2009 ) in their sample of early - type galaxies observed with the spitzer telescope .",
    "the atlas3d sauron spectroscopy of early - type galaxies highlights these results in detail and has detected optical emission lines and recent star formation in 75% of its sample galaxies which included many s0 galaxies ( sarzi et  al .",
    "2006 ; davis et  al . 2011 ; young et  al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "these multiwavelength studies of s0 galaxies over the last three decades or so , indicate that there is great variation in the gross observable properties of these objects .",
    "an important question then is whether these observed variations in gas and dust content and star formation history are consistent with _ all _ s0 galaxies having had a similar formation history .",
    "barway et  al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) have presented evidence to support the view that the formation history of s0 galaxies follows two very different routes .",
    "which route is taken seems to depend primarily upon the _ luminosity _ of the galaxy , although the environment also plays a role .",
    "according to this view , luminous s0 galaxies are likely to have formed their stars at early epochs through major mergers or rapid collapse followed by rapid star formation , similar to the formation of elliptical galaxies ( aguerri et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "the bulges of such s0 galaxies are more likely _ classical bulges _ ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) sharing most of their stellar and dynamical properties with low and medium mass elliptical galaxies ; the most massive ellipticals seem to be different ( gadotti 2009 ) .",
    "these luminous s0 galaxies with classical bulges were studied by hubble , and placed in close proximity to ellipticals on his tuning fork diagram . on the other hand , low - luminosity s0 galaxies likely formed by the quenching of star formation due to stripping of gas from the bulges and discs of late - type spiral galaxies through galaxy interactions or by motion in a dense environment ( aragn - salamanca , bedregal & merrifield 2006 ; bedregal , aragn - salamanca , & merrifield 2006 ; barr et  al .",
    "this fading scenario may not be applicable for the most massive ( and therefore luminous ) s0 galaxies harbouring populous globular clusters ( snchez - janssen & aguerri 2012 ) .",
    "the progenitor spiral galaxies of faint s0s , in turn , likely formed their _ pseudo bulges _ through secular evolution processes induced by bars .",
    "the bar formation could be episodic ; bars induce gas flows and vigourous star formation ( ellison et  al .",
    "2011 ; coelho & gadotti 2011 ) .",
    "the bars may subsequently be disrupted due to the combined effects of central mass concentration and gravity torques with the mass of the central concentration being an important parameter ( bournaud , combes & semelin 2005 ; athanassoula , lambert , & dehnen 2005 ) .",
    "the disruption of the bar would tend to stop the gas inflow to the central regions thereby quenching star formation .",
    "the process may then repeat over galaxy dynamical timescales ( carollo 1999 ; gadotti 2011 ; scannapieco & athanassoula 2012 ) .",
    "recent work has shown that this simple picture may not be correct ; the role of gas feedback on the weaking of the stellar bar is likely to be complicated ( berentzen et  al .",
    "the simulations presented in athanassoula , machado & rodionov ( 2013 ) do not see the destruction or dissolution of a bar , which in turn strongly argues for long - lived bars , at least in isolated galaxies",
    ". long lived bars are also found in the cosmological simulations presented in kraljic , bournaud & martig ( 2012 ) .",
    "if this picture is broadly correct ( given the uncertainties in bar longevity ) , there must be signatures of the formation mechanism imprinted in the various observable parameters of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , such imprints have been seen in the light profile ( as correlated bulge disc - sizes ) by barway et  al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) and the presence of kinematic structures , such as a stellar bar ( barway , wadadekar & kembhavi 2011 ; van den bergh 2012 ; skibba et  al .",
    "there should also be imprints on stellar kinematics ( as traced by 3d spectroscopy ) and in stellar populations ( as traced by broadband colours ) .",
    "the expectation is that luminous s0 galaxies should have colours characteristic of old stellar bulges ( like those found in most elliptical galaxies ) , while faint s0 galaxies should have colours indicating multiple episodes of star formation which would result in a mixed stellar population with a variety of ages , like those found in spiral galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we combine near and far uv data from the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) , optical data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , near - ir data from the 2micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , and mid - infrared data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et  al .",

    "we examined the color jpeg images as provided on the sdss website and 2 .",
    "we produced and examined higher signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath15 ) images made using the prescription of lisker , grebel & binggeli ( 2006 ) , by co - adding the sdss @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands .",
    "the visual inspection of galaxy images was performed by two of the authors independently .",
    "a final classification was made after discussing any inconsistent cases .",
    "we found five galaxies ( ugc 1157 , ugc 4596 , ugc 4963 , ugc 5638 , ugc 8204 ) with easy to detect spiral arms misclassified as s0s .",
    "we exclude these from our sample .",
    "a few other galaxies with very weak asymmetries in structure , indicative of spirals structure that has faded have been left in , in the sample .",
    "also , identifying ellipticals that are misclassified as s0s in the ugc catalog is a difficult exercise .",
    "only a handful of objects ( 5 galaxies ) fall into this category , but the consistency in classification with the two methods is weak . we have therefore chosen to leave these in , as well .",
    "this is not surprising because s0s with a very weak , face on disk appear very much like ellipticals even with the higher dynamic range of modern digital surveys .",

    "<S> we combine uv / optical / near - ir / mid - ir data on a sample of @xmath0240 s0 galaxies to examine various star formation related processes in them . </S>",
    "<S> we split the sample into bright and faint s0 galaxies based on their @xmath1 band luminosity . comparing the fuv - nuv versus nuv - k color - color diagram with a simple stellar population </S>",
    "<S> ( ssp ) model shows that ellipticals and bright s0 galaxies are dominated by a stellar population of age @xmath2 years while faint s0 galaxies may contain stars as young as @xmath3 years , providing evidence for relatively recent star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the 4000   break is also systematically higher in brighter s0 galaxies , again indicating the presence of an old stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> their mid - ir colours indicate that bright s0 colours are like those of ellipticals while faint s0 colours are more like spirals . </S>",
    "<S> all these observations are consistent with a scenario in which low - luminosity s0 galaxies likely formed by the stripping of gas from the discs of late - type spiral galaxies , which in turn formed their pseudo bulges through secular evolution processes , possibly involving multiple episodes of star formation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> more luminous s0 galaxies likely formed the bulk of their stars at early epochs , similar to the star formation in elliptical galaxies , and are characterised by an old coeval stellar population and classical bulges .    </S>",
