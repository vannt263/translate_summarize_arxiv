    ", much remains to be learned about how these condensates really evolve in out - of - equilibrium systems .    in this paper , we study the dynamical evolution of the chiral condensate in the @xmath0 linear sigma model and apply it to the expanding matter in a high energy heavy ion collision .",
    "we recall that the sigma field @xmath1 represents the quark condensate @xmath2 in the sense that they both have the same transformation properties for @xmath3 , corresponding to two flavors of massless quarks . at high temperatures , quarks and gluons exist in a deconfined , chirally symmetric phase . at some critical temperature of order 150 mev a transition to",
    "a hadronic phase occurs . in this confined and symmetry - broken phase",
    "the quark condensate is nonzero . in a collision between large nuclei",
    "the beam energy must be high enough so that the matter reaches at least approximate thermal equilibrium at a temperature greater than the critical temperature .",
    "we derive and solve an effective coarse - grained equation of motion for the chiral condensate , or mean sigma field , starting at the critical temperature and continuing down to the temperature where the system loses its ability to maintain local equilibrium and freezes out .",
    "the equation of motion approach we espouse here was used by linde in his pioneering work on phase transitions in relativistic quantum field theory @xcite , although he did not use this technique to analyze dissipative processes or fields out of equilibrium .",
    "our derivation of a coarse - grained field equation is based on linear response theory @xcite , where the connection between finite temperature averages and the evolution of an observable in real physical time is clear and straightforward .",
    "there is less clarity , in our opinion , with the influence functional @xcite and closely related closed time path @xcite methods as used by many others in this context @xcite .",
    "full nonlinear response theory is certainly equivalent to both of those methods , as indeed it must be since they all describe the same physics .",
    "however , in most cases practical calculations can only be performed when the deviation from thermal equilibrium is small .",
    "this is true of the influence functional and closed time path methods as well as response theory .",
    "still we are able to make several improvements to the most recent treatment @xcite of the linear sigma model .",
    "first , the complications associated with doubling of the field variables do not arise , nor those arising from paths in the complex time plane .",
    "second , we make a direct connection with physical response functions .",
    "it is clear that these response functions should be evaluated in the fully interacting equilibrium ensemble .",
    "here we shall estimate the relevant response functions by including the physical processes of sigma formation and decay via two pions , and the scattering of thermal pions and sigma mesons from sigma mesons in the condensate . to our knowledge ,",
    "the latter processes have not been studied before in this or any related context .",
    "the amplitudes for these processes are computed in tree approximation .    in section 2",
    "we derive the fundamental equation . in section 3 we calculate decay and scattering contributions to the dissipative term in the coarse - grained field equation for the condensate . in section 4",

    "the symmetry is spontaneously broken : the sigma field acquires a vacuum expectation value of @xmath9 , excitations of the sigma field have mass @xmath10 , and the pion is a goldstone boson since we neglect explicit chiral symmetry breaking here .",
    "the symmetry is restored by a second order phase transition at the critical temperature @xmath11 .",

    "( primes have been dropped for clarity of presentation . )",
    "the notation @xmath24 denotes averaging over the space - time volume chosen for coarse - graining and thus the precise division between the fast and slow parts of the field depends on the choice that is made .",
    "for example , one may include in the slow part only those fourier components with wavenumber below some cutoff value @xcite , or one may average the field fluctuations over some coarse - graining time @xcite .",
    "we shall not delve into any details here , but only remark that if the results depend strongly on the coarse - graining technique then the procedure is not very useful in the given context . in any case , the slow part represents occupation of the low momentum modes by a large number of particles and so may be treated as a slowly varying classical field . the fast part is a fully quantum field .",
    "the equilibrium ensemble average of an operator @xmath25 is denoted by @xmath26 and is characterized by the temperature @xmath14 and the full hamiltonian determined from the linear sigma model lagrangian in the absence of @xmath22 .",
    "when this equilibrium ensemble is perturbed by the presence of the field @xmath22 the hamiltonian is modified and the resulting ( nonequilibrium ) ensemble average is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noted at this point that we have not allowed for a nonzero ensemble average of the pion field .",
    "such a nonzero average is usually referred to as a disoriented chiral condensate , or dcc .",
    "one could certainly allow for a dcc and carry through the following computations in a straightforward way .",
    "however in thermal equilibrium a dcc never develops ( although it can arise from thermal fluctuations in a small system , but even then the probability is small @xcite ) .",

    "terms with no derivative or an even number of derivatives either renormalize existing terms in the equation of motion or add new nondissipative ones , such as @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "terms with an odd number of derivatives are explicitly dissipative .",
    "examples are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "perhaps the closest analysis to ours is due to rischke @xcite .",
    "the differences may be summarized thusly : first , rischke used the influence functional method @xcite , which is closely related to the closed - time - path method @xcite , for deriving the equations of motion of the classical field .",
    "we use linear response theory .",
    "since the former techniques ultimately rely on a perturbative expansion in terms of @xmath22 anyway , one might as well employ linear response theory to begin with .",
    "linear response theory is quicker , easier to use , and more intuitive .",
    "second , we write down the field equation for @xmath22 , which is the deviation of the scalar condensate from its equilibrium value @xmath21 .",
    "rischke writes down the equation of motion for @xmath65 .",
    "of course these approaches are equivalent .",
    "third , rischke s response functions are valid for free fields only . for example , a response function from eqs .",
    "( [ delsig][delpi ] ) has the form @xmath66 \\rangle_{eq}$ ] . for free fields this",
    "may be written @xmath67 $ ] where the @xmath68 are wightmann functions / propagators and the subscript indicates whether @xmath69 is greater than or less than @xmath70 . using our approach it is clear that these response functions should be evaluated in the fully interacting ensemble ( but unperturbed by @xmath22 ) . taken together with the second difference this constitutes a major improvement over rischke s analysis .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "fourth , rischke employed a particular coarse graining technique by separating soft and hard modes according to the magnitude of the momentum . we have left the coarse graining technique open . finally , with a view towards the formation of disoriented chiral condensates , or dcc , rischke allowed for slow classical components of the pion field .",
    "we have not done so here , mainly to keep the analysis as simple and direct as possible , although it could easily worked out in the same way as the sigma field .",
    "one s first inclination might be to evaluate the response functions using free fields .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath22 is so slowly varying in space and time that to first approximation it can be taken outside the integration over @xmath71 and @xmath69 .",
    "then it is a simple exercise to show that for a free field @xmath72 with mass @xmath73 and energy e one gets @xmath74 \\right\\rangle_{eq } = i \\int_0^t dt ' \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\frac{1}{e^2 } \\bigl ( 2 n_b(e / t ) + 1 \\bigr ) \\sin[2e(t - t')]\\;.\\ ] ] the temperature - independent piece is a vacuum contribution and may be dropped for the present discussion . in the case that @xmath75 the momentum integral",
    "is done trivially with the following result : @xmath76 \\ , .\\ ] ] in the limit that @xmath70 becomes large compared to @xmath77 this approaches the asymptotic value @xmath78 .",
    "this corresponds to the first term of a taylor expansion of @xmath22 and further terms in the series bring in powers of @xmath79 yielding dissipative coefficients that grow as @xmath80 , @xmath81 and so on . this is clearly unacceptable .",
    "the origin of this problem can be traced to the inadequacy of evaluating the response functions in the free field limit . indeed , these response functions are closely related to the shear and bulk viscosities via the kubo formulas which express those quantities in terms of ensemble averages of commutators of the energy - momentum tensor density operator at two different space - time points .",
    "it is known that determination of the viscosities requires summation of all ladder diagrams at a minimum @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to make a harmonic approximation @xcite instead of a taylor series expansion which , in this situation , can be formulated as : @xmath82 for the applications we have in mind in this paper the deviation of the scalar condensate from its equilibrium value is not expected to oscillate significantly ; rather , it is expected to decay exponentially to zero .",
    "therefore the harmonic approximation does not solve the problem .    rather than attempt a sophisticated evaluation of the response functions in this paper",
    "we shall proceed to estimate them based on direct physical reasoning .",
    "there are two obvious mechanisms for adding or removing sigma mesons from the condensate : ( 1 ) decay into two pions or the reverse process of formation via two pion annihilation , and ( 2 ) a meson from the thermal bath elastically scattering off a sigma meson and knocking it out of the condensate .",
    "the first of these processes is included in all analyses of the linear sigma model ; the second of these processes has not been studied in the literature to our knowledge .",
    "we shall evaluate them at the tree level .",
    "this means that the parameters in the lagrangian are to be fitted to experimental data at the tree level for consistency .",
    "let us examine each of these in turn .",
    "the decay rate of a sigma meson into two pions in the sigma s rest frame is @xcite @xmath83 when account is taken of the relation @xmath45 .",
    "the decay rate for a sigma meson at rest in the finite temperature system is bose - enhanced by a factor of @xmath84 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath85 is the bose - einstein occupation number with the indicated argument of its exponential .",
    "the rate for two pions to form a sigma meson at rest is obtained from detailed balance by multiplying @xmath86 by @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the net rate is @xmath88 = \\frac{(n-1)}{16\\pi } \\lambda m_{\\sigma } \\left [ 1 + 2n_b \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{(n-1)}{16\\pi } \\lambda m_{\\sigma } \\coth(m_{\\sigma}/4 t ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the argument of @xmath85 is the same as above . ) this leads to the dissipative term @xmath89 in the equation of motion @xcite .",
    "it agrees with eq .",
    "( 80 ) of rischke @xcite .",
    "scattering of a thermal boson @xmath90 off a sigma meson with negligibly small momentum and which is considered to be a component of the background field @xmath22 can be studied by evaluating the self - energy @xcite .",
    "@xmath91 here @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the energy and momentum of the boson @xmath90 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the normalization of the amplitude corresponds to the standard form of the optical theorem @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the momentum in the cm frame .",
    "because the cross section is invariant under longitudinal boosts the scattering amplitude transforms as follows : @xmath98 the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath99 determines the rate at which the field decays @xcite : @xmath100 the applicability of this expression is limited to those cases where interference between sequential scatterings is negligible .",
    "first consider pion scattering .",

    "the total cross section has a branch point and a pole at @xmath109 due to the @xmath103 channel exchange of a sigma meson .",
    "going beyond the tree level is necessary to incorporate the finite width of the sigma meson and regulate the singularity .",
    "indeed , the tree approximation is not reliable at high energy .",
    "for example , it is well known that unitarity is violated in @xmath110 scattering at energies of order of one to two times @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "therefore we are only allowed to use the low energy limit , which is quite acceptable when @xmath112 . in this limit @xmath113 where @xmath93 is the pion momentum in the sigma rest frame .",
    "notice the workings of adler s theorem here : according to that theorem the forward scattering amplitude @xmath114 evaluated in the rest frame of any target particle must vanish like @xmath115 as @xmath116 .",
    "notice also that the total cross section can not be obtained from the imaginary part of @xmath114 because we are essentially using a born approximation . in the limit that @xmath48",
    "we have the opposite situation where @xmath117 .",
    "then the three - point vertices do not contribute ( @xmath118 in place of ( 29 ) ) and so use of @xmath119 may be considered more appropriate .",
    "the contribution to the imaginary part of the self - energy is readily determined in these two limits . at low energy / temperature @xmath120 and at high energy / temperature @xmath121",

    "the total rate is obtained by addition of all components , namely : @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 other works , such as @xcite , do not include the latter two scattering contributions arguing that they are of order @xmath138 , while @xmath139 is of order @xmath7 .",
    "while this is correct at low @xmath14 when @xmath140 is large , it becomes questionable near to the critical temperature where @xmath140 is small ( see the discussion of fig . 1 below ) .",
    "it should be noted that the scattering contributions diverge at the critical temperature on account of division by the vanishing sigma mass .",
    "this may be a signal of the breakdown of the use of tree - level scattering amplitudes and requires further investigation .",
    "in this section we shall study solutions to the coarse - grained field equation in several limits .",
    "first , suppose that the volume and temperature are fixed in time but that the system is slightly out of equilibrium in the sense that @xmath141 .",

    "it is equivalent to a simple damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the system is underdamped if @xmath144 and overdamped if @xmath145 .",

    "we plot @xmath111 and the individual contributions to @xmath123 as functions of temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the field is overdamped when @xmath149 .",

    "this `` fireball '' will expand and cool , eventually reaching @xmath12 . at this moment , say at time @xmath150 , the initial conditions for the coarse - grained field must be specified .",

    "depending on whether the system is expanding spherically or only longitudinally along the beam axis ( @xmath68 = 3 or 1 , respectively ) we obtain the modified equation of motion @xmath151 in this situation @xmath70 is really the local , or proper , time and the term proportional to @xmath152 may be thought to arise from either the dalembertian or from a volume dilution term @xmath153 \\dot{\\sigma}_s$ ] @xcite analogous to the hubble expansion @xcite . perhaps the easiest way to obtain this equation",
    "is to derive the equation of motion for the total condensate @xmath154 and then make the substitution .",
    "most authors actually solve the equation of motion for @xmath155 , but this is a matter of taste .",
    "note that @xmath156 is the instantaneous value of the equilibrium condensate and that is why no potential for it appears above .",
    "in addition to the coarse - grained field equation one needs to know how the local temperature evolves with time .",
    "it must be assumed that it changes slowly enough so that local equilibrium can be maintained by the rapidly fluctuating pion and sigma fields . in principle one",
    "ought to solve the equation @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the energy density , @xmath159 is the enthalpy and @xmath160 is the pressure . rather than working out a detailed description of the equation of state , which is really dominated by the rapidly fluctuating thermal fields , we simply assume a free massless gas of pions where the pressure is proportional to @xmath161 .",

    "these response functions should be computed exactly and used in the resulting dissipative , coarse - grained equation of motion . however , such explicit computations are generally not possible to do .",
    "therefore , we identified the physical mechanisms responsible for the dissipation and estimated the corresponding response functions based on them .",
    "these mechanisms include the decay of sigma mesons in the condensate , and the knockout of sigma mesons in the condensate due to scattering with thermal sigma mesons and pions . to our knowledge ,",
    "the latter physical mechanisms have not been studied before .",
    "we then studied the dynamical evolution of the condensate in heavy ion collisions , after the phase transition from quark - gluon plasma to hadrons , and allowing for either one or three dimensional expansion of the hot matter .",
    "these showed that thermal equilibrium was reestablished rather rapidly , with a time constant of order 2 fm / c .",
    "clearly , much more could be studied along these same lines , including the formation and fate of disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc ) .",
