    "red giant stars rank among the brightest stars in the galaxy , being generally much brighter in the visible band than main sequence stars of the same spectral type . but",

    "this , combined with their enormous surface areas , gives them such large luminosities that they are easily observable even in very remote stellar populations .",
    "red giants grant us a tool for probing nearly all regions of the galaxy using a common indicator , a feat unparalleled by most other types of stars .    [ [ section ] ]    because many red giants are low to intermediate mass stars that have evolved beyond the main sequence , generally found in older stellar populations , their abundances can be indicators of early galactic chemical evolution . for example",
    ", by comparing observations of galactic bulge giants with those of giants located in the thin and thick disks and halo , it has been shown that the bulge likely experienced similar formation timescales , chemical evolution histories , star formation rates and initial mass functions as the local thick disk population @xcite .",
    "bulge and disk giants show some differences in their chemical abundances , with the bulge giants showing a higher relative abundance of select elements than the disk giants , suggesting more rapid chemical enrichment , possibly by ejecta from supernovae of types ia and ii @xcite .",

    "the distance moduli obtained from the @xmath2 pass - band magnitude of the trgb are comparable with those from primary distance indicators like cepheids and rr lyraes @xcite , and in some cases even suggest a reevaluation of the metallicity dependence and zero point calibration of the cepheid distance scale @xcite .",
    "the trgb method even has advantages over other distance determinations like those of cepheids and rr lyraes : @xmath3 the trgb method requires much less telescope time than variable stars ; @xmath4 the @xmath2 magnitude of the trgb is insensitive to the variation of metallicity for @xmath5}<-$ ] 0.7 ; and @xmath6 the trgb suffers less from extinction problems than cepheids , which are in general located in star - forming regions @xcite .",

    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in this work , we will explore the limitations of two of the simplifying assumptions of atmospheric modeling : horizontal homogeneity and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "both of these assumptions have been generally adopted because they are more computationally practical than the alternatives , requiring less time and fewer resources to arrive at a result . by comparison ,",
    "horizontal inhomogeneity requires model atmospheres to be calculated in two or three geometric dimensions ( 2d or 3d models ) instead of just one , and non - lte ( nlte ) requires that each level population be computed in statistical equilibrium ( se ) using iterative processes .    [ [ section-3 ] ]    however , horizontal homogeneity and lte both limit how realistic a model can be .",
    "simulations of red giant atmospheres performed in 3d have confirmed that turbulent surface convection causes horizontal inhomogeneities to form @xcite , such as visually observable surface features like solar granulation @xcite .",

[ [ section-4 ] ]    for stars exhibiting horizontal inhomogeneities , where the temperature varies across the features , @xmath1 is no longer a well defined quantity . by definition , @xmath1 is derived from the stefan - boltzmann law , where the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath23 ) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its @xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the @xmath24 of a horizontally inhomogeneous star may be similarly found by summing the @xmath23 of each of the inhomogeneous components , weighted by their relative surface coverage , and taking the fourth root of the result .",
    "this quantity is defined empirically by intrinsic properties of real or model stars and is independent of fitting models to observable quantities .",
    "alternatively , another model fitting independent @xmath1 can be defined from the long wavelength tails of stellar spectra .",
    "because flux has a linear dependence on @xmath1 in the rayleigh - jeans limit , an estimate of the @xmath1 can be made from measuring the absolute surface flux of the r - j tail .",
    "this dependence is used by the infrared flux method @xcite to determine @xmath1 from the r - j tails of spectra ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the key idea for a horizontally inhomogeneous star having the same @xmath24 as a horizontally homogeneous star , is that the seds will differ based on the variation of the modeling parameters , such as @xmath1 , across the inhomogeneous surface .",
    "for example , using the planck function , @xmath26 to describe the shape of a stellar continuum illustrates the issue directly @xcite . a star with a range of differing temperatures across the surface does not have a directly obvious value of @xmath1 that should be used , and because of the equation s non - linear dependence on @xmath1",
    ", this is an important question .",
    "the higher temperature material will contribute disproportionately more flux than the lower temperature material , with a dependence on wavelength , and will alter the spectrum from that of a horizontally homogeneous star of the same @xmath24 accordingly .",

    "the nlte effects of fe group elements on the model structure and @xmath27 distribution have been shown to be much more important for predicting a sed than the nlte effects of all the light metals combined , and serve to substantially increase the near - uv @xmath27 levels as a result of nlte fe i overionization @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this effect has been shown to be inversely proportional to the completeness of the fe i atomic model used in the atmospheric modeling @xcite , discussed in detail in section [ phoenix ] .",
    "these failures of 1d nlte models to predict observable quantities may be , in part , related to the exclusion of horizontal inhomogeneities in the models .",
    "our primary goal is investigating the relation between errors introduced in determining a star s @xmath1 from assuming horizontal homogeneity and those introduced by assuming lte .",
    "we look to determine how distinguishable 3d hydro and nlte effects are when looking at low resolution diagnostics ( photometric colors and overall seds ) .",
    "the error inherent in assuming lte is expected to remain approximately constant for different levels of horizontal inhomogeneity , as any changes in a lte spectrum caused by the inhomogeneities should also be represented to a similar degree in the corresponding nlte spectrum , as the relative difference in the flux distribution between lte and nlte should remain roughly constant within the @xmath1 range studied in this work .",

    "in general , the calculation of a 2d model atmosphere requires a very substantial increase in computational effort over that needed for 1d models .",
    "however , there are two regimes of validity for which the situation simplifies ; these are often referred to as 1.5d models .",
    "the valid regimes are either 1 ) when the geometric scale of the inhomogeneities is so small that they are very optically thin , and every emergent ray may be assumed to have fully sampled both warm and cool components of the atmosphere many times , or 2 ) that the inhomogeneities are large enough that they are optically thick to their own radiation so that the flux is similar to that of two spatially unresolved stars .",
    "regardless , both regimes require that the inhomogeneities be small enough and randomly distributed so that there is no correlation between component @xmath1 values and limb darkening . by assuming the average size of surface features to be that of 3d hydro modeled red giant granules",
    ", we satisfy both conditions of the larger inhomogeneity regime .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    we construct our 1.5d seds by taking the linear average of two 1d nlte seds .",
    "two - dimensional information , such as the difference in temperature among features or the relative portion of the stellar surface covered by the different features , can be approximated by choosing the parameters of the 1d components being averaged , and the averaging weights .",
    "these 1.5d nlte seds and derived colors , approximating 2d effects , are treated as artificial `` observations '' of real stars that are fitted with a library of nlte and lte 1d trial spectra for inferring the @xmath1 of the 1.5d stars .",
    "a grid of 50 1d stellar model atmospheres and corresponding synthetic spectra was produced for this purpose using the phoenix code .",
    "the phoenix code can be used to model nlte atmospheres and spectra of stellar objects throughout the h - r diagram @xcite .",
    "phoenix version 15 is utilized for all modeling calculations in this work .",
    "it is important to include nlte effects in model atmospheres and synthetic spectra .",
    "together , they can lead to a difference in the blue and near - uv bands flux of up to 50% over corresponding phoenix lte models of red giant stars as a result of nlte fe i overionization @xcite , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : exampleseds ] .",
    "it is also understood that nlte radiative equilibrium in these stars is model - dependent and is known to depend on the completeness of the atomic model of fe i and the completeness and accuracy of the collisional cross - sections for fe i ionization .",
    "while the free electron collisional cross - sections for fe i used by phoenix are robust , it does not take into account h collisions , and it has been cautioned that this may cause phoenix to overestimate the effects of fe i overionization @xcite .",
    "additionally , it was shown by @xcite that using a more complete fe i atomic model than that used by phoenix will reduce overionization effects by providing more fe i high energy excited states to facilitate recombinations from fe ii .",
    "they also found that the greater the number of energy levels within @xmath28 = k@xmath1 of the ground state ionization energy ( @xmath29 ) , the more accurate the nlte ionization equilibrium solution .",
    "the number of energy levels in our model fe i atom within @xmath28 = k@xmath1 of @xmath29 ranges from one to four as @xmath1 increases from 4250 ( @xmath25 of our 1.5d spectra ) to 4750 k ( our hottest 1.5d component ) .",
    "this has been found to be too few to accurately compute the nlte recombination rate , and we expect to over - estimate the nlte fe i overionization . however , we note that the 1.5d target spectra and the 1d library of fitted nlte spectra were computed with the _ same _ fe i atomic model . therefore , we expect the difference between fitted 1d nlte @xmath1 values and @xmath24 to be dominated by horizontal inhomogeneity effects .",
    "we also note that the magnitude of any difference in inferred @xmath1 value between fitting with 1d nlte spectra and 1d lte spectra will be over estimated , especially for any diagnostics involving wavebands bluer than the v filter , where the overionization effects are dominant .",
    "therefore we concern ourselves primarily with how this difference depends on the degree of inhomogeneity in the 1.5d spectra being fit , and ignore the magnitude .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    the stellar parameters adopted for our @xmath25 equivalent 1d star are @xmath1 = 4250 k , log @xmath7 = 2.0 , and [ m / h ] = -0.5 with the alpha elements , from o to ti , enhanced by [ a / h ] = + 0.3 dex .",
    "the nlte models were constructed by treating the 20 atomic species listed in table [ tab : nlte species list ] as nlte species when calculating energy level populations , all of them in the neutral state and most in the singly ionized state as well @xcite .",
    "phoenix does not calculate level populations for molecular species in nlte ; molecules are treated in lte for nlte models and spectra .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    nlte radiative equilibrium is complex in that any given transition may either heat or cool the atmosphere with respect to lte , depending on how rapidly @xmath30 increases inward at the transition wavelength , whether the transition is located in the wien or rayleigh - jeans regime , and whether the transition is a net heater or cooler in lte with respect to the gray atmosphere @xcite . for our @xmath1 range ,",

    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    to prepare the grid of models , we varied the @xmath1 value from 3550 k to 4750 k , with @xmath35 = 50 k , and produced both lte and nlte models . upon convergence of a model structure ,",
    "two different spectra were synthesized for each model , the fully line blanketed sed and the pure continuum sed for use in normalizing the flux in the line blanketed seds .",

    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    finally , to increase the apparent formal numerical resolution of the grid s @xmath1 range sampling , additional seds were linearly interpolated between neighboring seds in the grid to reach a final apparent temperature resolution of 25 k. this was done to smooth the final fitted @xmath1 value versus degree of inhomogeneity relation .",
    "however , we note that this does not decrease the formal uncertainty of the @xmath1 determination .",
    "linear interpolation of the flux values was used instead of interpolating the log flux values because at the small ratio of @xmath41 , the relative difference of the monochromatic flux ( @xmath42 ) between the two methods was less than 1.0 % at all wavelength sampling points .",
    "seventeen unique 1.5d seds were produced to serve as artificial 2d targets by linearly averaging two synthetic nlte 1d seds .",
    "these were individually distinguished by the differences in the @xmath1 values of their warm and cool 1d components , @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath0 corresponds to the contrast of inhomogeneities .",
    "it was enforced that , for each 1.5d sed , the linear average of their component @xmath1 values be 4250 k , effectively giving each of the 1.5d seds a @xmath25 = 4250 k. the production of 1.5d seds by the linear averaging of the component fluxes in this way results in continuum levels in the rayleigh - jeans tails being identical within a few percent , and was chosen to maintain a consistent observational property among all of the 1.5d seds .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    two different weighting schemes were used in creating the 1.5d seds : 1 ) evenly weighting both components as a simple reference case ; and 2 ) weighting the hot component at a ratio of 2:1 to the cool component .",

    "these two methods simulate a variation in surface coverage , or filling factor ( ff ) , of the hot and cool features .",
    "hereafter , the evenly weighted method is referred to as having a 1:1 ff , and the method with the hot component being weighted at 2:1 as referred to as having a 2:1 ff . to fully explore the effects of horizontal inhomogeneity , we take the upper limit of 300 k for the rms temperature difference across the features found from 3d modeling , and double it to 600 k , for a maximum realistic value of @xmath0 .",
    "we then extend this value up to 1000 and 1050 k , for the 1:1 and 2:1 ff respectively , to test how large the rms temperature variations would have to be before 1d estimates of @xmath1 become very misleading , with significant departures from @xmath24 . table [",

    "<S> five different quantities are fit to determine the @xmath1 of the 1.5d stars : ubvri photometric colors , absolute surface flux seds , relative seds , continuum normalized spectra , and tio band profiles . in all cases except the tio band profiles </S>",
    "<S> , the inferred @xmath1 value increases with increasing @xmath0 . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the inferred @xmath1 value from fitting 1d lte quantities is higher than from fitting 1d nlte quantities and is approximately constant as a function of @xmath0 within each case . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between lte and nlte for the tio bands is caused indirectly by the nlte temperature structure of the upper atmosphere , as the bands are computed in lte . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the difference between @xmath1 values derived from nlte and lte modelling is relatively insensitive to the degree of the horizontal inhomogeneity of the star being modeled , and largely depends on the observable quantity being fit . </S>"
