    "for some decades now , phenomenological research into physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been driven by the question of ` what new physics should we see ? ' that is to say , the sm leaves unresolved several deep mysteries , such as the electroweak hierarchy problem , the flavour puzzle , the identity of dark matter , the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry , & c , and new models that address these issues inevitably predict new degrees of freedom .",
    "diverse and intense experimental efforts have been directed towards their discovery .",
    "thus far however , although there are some intriguing anomalies , there has been no decisive experimental break with the sm . indeed , the myriad null searches ( both direct and virtual ) now very tightly constrain the form of any new physics near the tev scale . our dominant inspiration ,",
    "the hierarchy problem , has led to beautiful new ideas and the vision of a rich new spectrum , but proposed resolutions only remain viable in small regions of their natural parameter space .    happily , the game is far from over .",
    "analysis of the large tevatron data set is ongoing , and the lhc has begun the most thorough exploration yet of the tev scale .",
    "hopes are high for the discovery of new physics",
    ". it may be that an unforeseen , but fully satisfying , resolution to the hierarchy problem emerges directly from the data . or it may be that standard considerations of the hierarchy problem and fine - tuning provide only a very crude guide as to where new physics should appear . in that case",
    ", one of the existing paradigms may yet be discovered , with parameters that seem to us `` tuned '' at the _ per cent _ level . but life could be more complicated",
    ". there may well be a rich new threshold at which the lion s share of the hierarchy problem is resolved , but it may lie above lhc reach , say at 10 tev , or 100 tev , with @xmath0 tuning by effective field theory measure . in that case , even the lhc will catch only those associated states that happen to be exceptionally light , an opening move but not the end - game . a rough parallel",
    "can be found in the sm itself : among the states that feel electroweak breaking we first discovered the electron because it was one of the lightest , even though it was not a `` major player '' of the likes of the @xmath1 , top or higgs . if the lhc , at least in its early stages , is sensitive only to a light vestige of a major mechanism at higher energies , the question shifts from ` what new physics _",
    "should _ we see ? ' to the more humble ` what new physics _",
    "could _ we see ? ' more precisely : what new physics ( however dimly perceived its ultimate `` purpose '' ) is consistent , without too much theoretical artifice , with the many existing constraints ?    there are three reasons for trying to develop a systematic approach to this question .",
    "firstly , the constraints on tev physics are so strong that , subject to some plausible assumptions , the litany of new physics possibilities may be short enough to catalogue . secondly , the complexities of hadron machines are such that we are unlikely to discover anything without expressly looking for it .",
    "thirdly , such a catalogue of allowed , albeit `` unmotivated '' , possibilities is of theoretical use , in highlighting new paradigms , mechanisms and modules which guarantee consistency with existing constraints .",
    "it is to this general programme that we will contribute in this paper .",
    "let us first establish some ground rules , whose purpose is to balance the observability of tev - scale new physics against its plausible connection to some deeper theoretical  plot \" . while scenarios such as weak scale supersymmetry predict a doubling or more of the sm spectrum , we contemplate here a much more modest number of new particles with sub - tev masses , with perhaps a richer but heavier spectrum out of range .",
    "we will also focus on particles that can be readily and directly produced at colliders , with appreciable coupling to the sm , in particular to sm gauge bosons and/or to sm light fermions .",
    "this balances experimental observability with our best guess that a light vestige of some ( generally heavy ) solution to the sm hierarchy problem should couple directly to the sm .    at the technical level , the requirement that the new particles couple substantially to the sm implies that these couplings are _ renormalizable _ in form .",
    "this is because non - renormalizable couplings rapidly weaken below the scale of their uv completion , and we are contemplating that any such higher physics scale is at least above lhc reach . non - renormalizable interactions may however play an important role in the decays of a new particle , especially if its renormalizable interactions alone would leave it stable .",
    "renormalizability restricts the new particles to spin @xmath2 .",
    "new particles with sm gauge quantum numbers then certainly represent a very plausible possibility , and also a very safe option from the point of view of existing constraints .",
    "gauge interactions are famously `` flavour - blind '' and so this kind of new physics can readily evade stringent fcnc constraints , while still allowing pair - production ( or even resonant production @xcite ) of new particles . very weak or non - renormalizable couplings to the sm may subsequently mediate the decay of these particles , with only mild constraints from flavour physics .",
    "another possibility is that the new particles are themselves spin-1 gauge bosons under which some of the sm is charged .",
    "again , the choice of gauge couplings can naturally be sufficiently flavour - blind , but constraints from electroweak precision tests or searches for jet or lepton excesses can still be challenging .",
    "gauge interactions are the only renormalizable interactions until one introduces scalars .",
    "minimally , this could be just the sm higgs boson , to which new particles can couple .",
    "but one might also have a new scalar .",
    "beyond sm gauge interactions , a new scalar can also have sizable yukawa couplings to a pair of sm fermions , or to a sm fermion and a new fermion .",
    "such yukawa couplings might well provide a new window on flavour physics .",
    "indeed , one might worry that the vast array of past flavour tests already severely constrains this possibility unless there is a very special mechanism in place .",
    "let us survey the possibilities for such a scalar , @xmath3 . denoting sm quarks by @xmath4 , sm leptons by @xmath5 , and possible new fermions by @xmath6",
    ", we see that the list of @xmath3 yukawa couplings with at least one sm fermion is given by ( i ) @xmath7 , ( ii ) @xmath8 , ( iii ) @xmath9 ( iv ) @xmath10 , ( v ) @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath3 of category ( i ) necessarily has the same electroweak quantum numbers of the sm higgs multiplet , and is either colour octet @xcite or colour singlet .",
    "it is well understood that such generalized higgses can all too readily mediate excessive fcncs if they lie below a tev , unless their couplings are very carefully chosen . if there is a second colour - singlet higgs doublet , the glashow - weinberg rule @xcite for designating one as an up - type higgs and the other as down - type , as enforced for example by supersymmetry ,",
    "ensures the absence of tree - level higgs - mediated fcncs .",
    "more generally , a much tighter yukawa - coupling _ ansatz _ , such as minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite , is required to suppress tree - level fcncs .",
    "it requires quite specialized structure in the uv to arrange for it .",
    "even a small deviation from the mfv structure can be deadly , leading to excessive fcncs . category ( ii )",
    "@xmath3s are `` leptoquarks '' .",
    "such couplings can be relevant for decays at hadron colliders @xcite , but unlikely to dominate production .",
    "sfermions of supersymmetry are examples of category ( iii ) , with @xmath6 being a gaugino or higgsino . of course , this case is famously dangerous for fcncs , as encapsulated in the supersymmetric flavour problem .",
    "again , special patterns such as gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking can evade this generic concern .",
    "category ( iv ) @xmath3s are `` dileptons '' , which are less relevant to hadronic collider production .",
    "finally , category ( v ) @xmath3s are `` diquarks '' . such couplings , if strong enough , can play an important role in new physics production at hadronic colliders @xcite .",
    "indeed , they have already been suggested by several authors @xcite as an explanation for the @xmath12 forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "they are the focus of this paper .",
    "navely , such diquark couplings , @xmath11 , appear to pose similar fcnc concerns as higgs - like couplings , @xmath13 @xcite , evaded only by the same level of specialization of couplings , such as mfv @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this is _ not _ necessarily the case .",
    "for example , consider a colour - triplet scalar that couples to right - handed up - type quarks , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "qcd gauge invariance implies colour antisymmetry , which in turn implies flavour antisymmetry of the quarks .",
    "now , antisymmetry implies that any flavour - changing diagram must involve all three generations of quarks .",
    "indeed , with only two quark generations , the diquark coupling is proportional to @xmath16 , which is an invariant tensor of the @xmath17 flavour symmetry acting on @xmath18 .",
    "this has various consequences .",
    "for example , tree - level @xmath3 exchange can not mediate @xmath19 fcncs , since only two generations would be involved . even at one - loop , the contributions to neutral @xmath20-meson mixing must proceed via the third generation .",
    "thus , they do not involve the @xmath21 coupling , which consequently may be of order unity , even for a diquark mass of a few hundred gev , resulting in a huge production cross section at the lhc .",
    "as we shall see , there are also remarkable suppressions of flavour - diagonal , electric dipole moments ( edms ) , in that diagrams involving only quarks and diquarks do not contribute at _ any _ loop order .",
    "such considerations make a much broader and more plausible flavour structure of diquark couplings possible .",
    "indeed our purpose here is to point out that scalars with substantial diquark couplings represent a unique combination of experimental and theoretical opportunity at hadron colliders such as the lhc and tevatron .",
    "in addition to their qcd couplings , the diquark couplings can be strong enough to play an important role in new physics production and decay .",
    "the fact that these couplings can tolerate a variety of patterns without already being ruled out by flavour and other precision data means that experiments can teach us something about flavour structure that we do not already know .",
    "( by contrast , in the mfv _ ansatz _ , precisely the flavour structure of sm yukawa couplings is replicated in new physics . ) finally , such ",
    "diquark \" scalars can very plausibly represent the low end of a new spectrum which addresses the `` big '' hierarchy problem .",
    "for example , the scalars might be ( i ) pseudo - goldstone bosons of a new strong dynamics which makes a composite higgs boson , ( ii ) squark remnants of supersymmetric physics , with @xmath22-parity violating couplings to quarks , ( iii ) a coloured partner of the sm higgs boson in some ( orbifold ) unification schemes @xcite . or they may be a light vestige of something unanticipated .",
    "it is certainly not the case that _ any _ flavour structure of diquark couplings is consistent with fcnc constraints .",
    "instead , we will be guided very broadly by what we already see in the flavour structure of sm quark yukawa couplings .",
    "the hierarchical pattern of quark masses and mixing angles strongly suggests that there is a particular electroweak gauge basis in which the yukawa matrices have a hierarchical structure of matrix elements , such that the first , second , and third generations have an increasing degree of connectedness to the sm higgs boson .",
    "while the sm itself offers no explanation of this fact , it can be understood in a variety of uv theories in which these three quark generations are distinguished .",
    "for example , in froggatt - nielsen theory @xcite , the hierarchical structure arises from assigning the three generations distinct charges under a higgsed @xmath23 gauge theory . in higher - dimensional theories",
    ", hierarchy arises when the three generations have distinct extra - dimensional wavefunctions with varying overlaps with the higgs boson @xcite . in",
    "strongly - coupled ( or ads / cft - related warped ) models , the three generations are distinguished by scaling dimensions @xcite .",
    "the minimal structure we will impose on diquark couplings is that they and the sm yukawa matrices are hierarchical in the same electroweak gauge basis .",
    "they need not , however , exhibit the _ same _ hierarchical structure .",
    "this seems to us the most plausible and broadly phrased approach to how new physics flavour structure might appear at collider energies .",
    "note that this assumption in no way saves all types of new scalars from danger .",
    "for example , new higgs bosons with hierarchical couplings that approximately mimic sm yukawa couplings would satisfy our criteria , but would give tree - level fcncs , typically far in excess of experiment . only a much more restrictive _ ansatz _",
    ", such as mfv , can avoid this . more generally , even if we started with an extreme hierarchy of couplings for a new higgs - like scalar in the gauge basis , with only a single , non - vanishing , diagonal entry in the coupling matrix , the rotation required to go to the quark mass basis would already lead to tree - level fcncs , again typically excessive .",
    "but we will show that scalars with diquark couplings are much safer .",
    "so safe in fact that , at least for antisymmetrically - coupled diquarks , any one of the couplings could be the largest .",
    "thus , the largest coupling may involve quarks of the second and third , the first and second , or the first and third generations and each gives rise to a distinct phenomenology .",
    "we call the resulting hierarchies the normal , inverted , and perverted hierarchies , respectively",
    ". the perverted hierarchy , in particular , can be used to explain the asymmetry in @xmath12 production in a way that is consistent with constraints from @xmath20-meson mixing and single top production .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : para ] , we will further frame our flavour philosophy , and illustrate how it naturally fits with popular uv approaches to flavour structure . in  [ sec : clas ] , we classify diquarks by their sm gauge charges , tree - level fcncs , and proton stability . in ",
    "[ sec : loop ] , we consider loop - level effects . in  [ sec : skew ] , we restrict ourselves further to the two states with ( automatically ) antisymmetric flavour couplings and determine existing bounds on the masses and couplings coming from one - loop processes and from tree - level , flavour - violating decays .",
    "we discuss flavour - diagonal processes and electroweak precision tests in  [ sec : diag ] and outline strategies for collider searches for the various paradigms in ",
    "[ sec : coll ] .",
    "we begin our journey with the yukawa couplings of the sm , which generate the observed masses and mixings of quarks and provide the origin of flavour in the sm .",
    "as is well - known , these masses and mixings are not anarchical , but rather possess a curious pattern of hierarchies and degeneracies .",
    "one _ ansatz _ for the yukawa couplings that leads to a good description of the observed masses and mixings takes the form ( see _ e.  g.  _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are hierarchical between the different generations ( though not necessarily between the different quark multiplets ) and the coefficients @xmath26 are of order one",
    ". we will refer to the yukawa structure of eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) as the _ chiral hierarchy_.    passing to the mass basis , we find that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 should be of order one in order to reproduce the large top quark mass , while the ckm matrix is given by @xmath29 the three measured mixings , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , then fix @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the cabibbo angle , together with the successful  prediction \" @xmath36",
    ". we may then solve for the remaining five @xmath37 parameters in terms of the remaining five quark masses . in all",
    ", we have @xmath38 in the sm , the only physical parameters arising from the rotation are contained in the quark masses and the ckm matrix ; when we add new physics states coupled to quarks , other parts of the quark rotations also become physical . in this way",
    ", new physics could also be important for further elucidating the flavour structure within the sm : the presence of new physics is necessary to render the right handed rotations measurable , but these rotations are part of the same underlying structure that generates the sm flavour parameters . in particular , chiral hierarchy ( [ basis ] ) predicts right - handed rotations which take the same form as ( [ mixings ] ) , but with @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 where in making the estimates we have taken central values for the quark masses at the tev scale . while @xmath41 is parametrically equal to the cabibbo angle and @xmath42 is larger than @xmath30 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are much smaller than their ckm counterparts .",
    "this asymmetry between the left- and right - handed rotations arises because the yukawa couplings in chiral hierarchy are not symmetric matrices",
    ". we shall later see that the suppression of mixings may lead to an important suppression of flavour - changing processes from new physics and will be crucial for explaining the @xmath12 asymmetry in the context of our flavour paradigm .    while chiral hierarchy gives a good fit to the measured hierarchies in masses and mixings , it is unnecessarily restrictive for our needs . in particular , the suppression of right _ versus _ left mixings just described need",
    "not be a general feature of hierarchical yukawa couplings . as a counter - example , in a gut model with all quarks living in the same multiplet , one might expect the yukawa matrices to be symmetric or antisymmetric and thus the right rotation matrix to be equal to the complex conjugate of the left rotation matrix . as a result ,",
    "if the rotations in the up and down sectors were comparable , we would have @xmath45 so , in order to be as general as possible , we shall not impose chiral hierarchy in what follows . rather , we shall assume that there exists some pattern of hierarchies in the sm yukawa couplings and that the resulting mixings in the right handed sector lie somewhere between the values in ( [ rmixings ] ) , which correspond to chiral hierarchy , and the values in ( [ ckmmixings ] ) , which we refer to as _ ckm - like mixing_.    now let us move on to new physics .",
    "our flavour philosophy will be that any new physics should also possess some hierarchical structure in its couplings , _ in the gauge basis_. from the ir viewpoint , this seems not only reasonable ( since the sm yukawa couplings already possess such a structure ) , but also necessary ( in that anarchic , sizable new couplings would be irreconcilable with flavour physics constraints ) .",
    "in contrast with the previous literature , we shall not insist that the hierarchical structure in the new couplings is the same as the structure in the higgs yukawa couplings .",
    "rather , we shall take the view that any structure is acceptable , especially given our ignorance about the uv dynamics that generates flavour .    before continuing",
    ", we should address one objection that may irk the reader : why , from the uv viewpoint , should the couplings of both the higgs and extra scalars to fermions be hierarchical in the same basis ?",
    "if they are not , then the rotation from one basis to the other would restore anarchy in one or other of the coupling matrices , with disastrous consequences for flavour physics .",
    "we claim that having both coupling matrices hierarchical in the same gauge basis is quite plausible , if one takes the viewpoint that the uv theory of flavour makes a strong distinction between the different fermion generations , as occurs in the examples mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in an extra - dimensional model , for example , a hierarchical flavour structure that arises because of",
    "small wavefunction overlaps will appear in the couplings of all scalars , in the same basis .",
    "another objection to our philosophy might be that , although a hierarchical structure in the higgs and new scalar couplings is plausible , different hierarchical structures are not .",
    "this does not seem to hold water to us either , since different scalars may interact in very different ways with the sm fermions .",
    "indeed , the examples in  [ sec : intro ] can easily generate different hierarchical structures for different scalars : in the extra - dimensional case , for example , it suffices to localize the scalars in different places ; in the froggatt - nielsen case , it suffices to assign different flavon charges to different scalars .    to be explicit ,",
    "let us sketch how each of these two examples could give rise to the normal , inverted , or perverted hierarchies which we introduced above for antisymmetrically - coupled diquarks , as follows .",
    "in the extra - dimensional example , imagine that both scalars and fermions have wavefuctions that are exponentially localized ( in some metric ) , but that the profiles of fermions are broader than those of the scalars .",
    "the yukawa couplings then take exactly the form in ( [ basis ] ) , where the @xmath37 parameters are given by the values of the respective fermion wavefunctions evaluated at the location of the scalar .",
    "thus , the third generation is simply the fermion that lives closest to the higgs , while the first generation is furthest away and the second generation is somewhere in between .",
    "then , to obtain the normal hierarchy , it suffices to localize the new scalar closer to the second and third generations than to the first .",
    "the other hierarchies can be obtained by moving the location of the new scalar around in an obvious way .    in the froggatt - nielsen example , suppose that the flavon symmetry is a @xmath23 , under which the higgs is neutral and @xmath46 and @xmath47 have positive semi - definite charges @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath37 parameters are then given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the ratio of the flavon vev to the cut - off .",
    "to get the large top mass requires @xmath51 .",
    "one may then obtain any one of the three hierarchies by an appropriate choice of a negative charge , @xmath52 , for the new scalar , since the coupling to quarks of generations @xmath53 and @xmath54 will be suppressed by @xmath55 .",
    "for example , in the simplest case in which @xmath46 and @xmath47 have common charge @xmath56 , the choice @xmath57 , corresponds to the perverted hierarchy with subdominant couplings ( in the gauge basis ) given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 . , where @xmath60 is the flavon and @xmath61 is the cut - off .",
    "such suppression factors can not be determined just by counting the froggatt - nielsen charges of the sm fields alone .",
    "our extra - dimensional example shows that the same is true also in that case , because new - physics interactions and sm higgs yukawa couplings can be sensitive to different parts of the quark profiles .",
    "a simple counting of the suppression factors in the coefficients of the non - renormalizable , flavour - violating operators , based on powers of quark wave - functions , would give an incorrect result .",
    "the specific features of the uv flavour theory are essential for determining the pattern of flavour violation in the quark sector and these can not be captured by an effective - theory analysis .",
    "a similar result was obtained , in the supersymmetric context , in @xcite . ]    before closing this section , we stress that we do not wish to restrict ourselves to an explicit flavour model .",
    "indeed , we mention them here only to motivate our generalized flavour paradigm .",
    "if we consider scalars coupled to a pair of quarks , via a yukawa coupling , then there are eight possibilities , distinguished by the representation under the sm gauge group and listed in table [ diquark2 ] . or @xmath62 , but will be ruled out by tree - level fcnc constraints as _ per _ the discussion for scalar states . ]",
    "an important observation is that diquark couplings to @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 imply symmetry or antisymmetry of the corresponding yukawa matrices in flavour space in the gauge basis .",
    "we note that the symmetry properties under interchange of flavour indices are preserved under flavour rotations in @xmath66 .",
    "this further implies that the pure up- or down - type couplings ( to @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath67 ) retain their symmetry properties in the quark mass basis .",
    "( the mixed up / down - type @xmath68 couplings do not , because distinct rotations on @xmath69 and @xmath70 are required to go to the quark mass basis ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for the inverted hierarchy , in which there is a sizable coupling involving the first and second generation quarks , we have the option of searching either for a resonance in the @xmath71 channel , or searching for an excess resulting from diquark exchange in the @xmath72-channel .",
    "the former channel is initiated by a quark from the first and a quark from the second generation ( or a pair of anti - quarks ) , whereas the latter channel is quark - antiquark initiated , and these may both belong to the first generation .",
    "thus , for the tevatron , we might expect that the strongest bounds come from @xmath72 channel exchange searches . passing to the lhc",
    ", the search sensitivity for @xmath72-channel exchange will be enhanced by the energy reach and luminosity , but will be suppressed by the fact that we need to produce an antiquark out of the sea .",
    "cdf , d0 , atlas and cms should all be able to present bounds , since they have searched for evidence of the quark contact interaction term , @xmath73 in dijet distributions , quoting lower bounds on @xmath61 of 1.6 @xcite , 3.1 @xcite , 3.4 @xcite , and 5.6 @xcite tev , respectively .",
    ", which is the ratio of the number of observed events with @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 are the jet rapidities ) to the number of observed events at any @xmath6 , in an event sample with dijet invariant mass exceeding 1.2 tev .",
    "unfortunately , we expect no more than 0.1 events with such a large dijet invariant mass , for diquark coupling not exceeding one and mass exceeding 200 gev .",
    "] we estimate that the second of these searches translates to bounds of 600 gev for the diquark coupled to up quarks and 300 gev for the diquark coupled to down quarks , at unit diquark coupling .",
    "we stress however that these estimates are not robust , not least because the assumption of contact interactions is invalidated at such low masses ; we regard them as merely suggestive of what might be achieved with a dedicated analysis .      turning now to dijet resonance searches ,",
    "these are necessarily quark - quark initiated , but also necessarily require a quark from each of the first and second generations . as a result",
    ", there is not necessarily any gain in passing from a @xmath76 to a @xmath77 collider , at least in the limit that the pdfs of strange and charmed quarks equal those of the corresponding antiquarks . moreover , the enhancement for diquarks coupled to an up quark , rather than a down quark , is mitigated by the fact that one must also couple to a charm quark , which is , of course , somewhat heavier than the strange quark . as a result , we see from table  [ xsections14tev ] that cross sections for production of diquark resonances coupled to up - type quarks are similar to those for diquarks coupled to down - type quarks .    there is , of course , a gain to be had in passing from the tevatron to the lhc in terms of energy reach .",
    "cms has performed a search using 3.1 @xmath78 of data and presented an exclusion in terms of signal cross section times acceptance as a function of resonance mass @xcite . since the search is based on ` bump - hunting ' techniques , the sensitivity of the search ( and , _ ergo _ , the bound ) , can only be independent of the model in the limit that the intrinsic resonance width is somewhat less that the experimental resolution , which is dominated by the jet energy resolution .",
    "moreover , the bound depends on the nature of the initial and final state partons .",
    "one effect accounted for in @xcite is that gluon - initiated jets radiate more than quark - initiated ones , leading to a broader bump for resonances involving the former .",

    "the search strategy is similar to the one of cms , except that cdf uses the quark - gluon resonance profile to set a limit on diquark resonances . since the former are broader than the latter , due to the different radiation properties of quarks versus gluons , this presumably represents a conservative bound .",

    "we can also use our estimate of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 couplings to compare with constraints on single top production . in @xcite , a very rough bound on @xmath85 is obtained , by requiring that the lo cross - section for @xmath86 plus @xmath87 at the tevatron not exceed the uncertainty in the measured cross section for single production of top quarks , @xmath88 pb @xcite , which agrees with the sm prediction for @xmath89 gev . the bound varies between @xmath90 for @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 for @xmath93 gev .",
    "again , there is some tension at lower mass values , but the diquark explanation seems not unreasonable",
    ".      for the normal and perverted hierarchies , the ( associated ) single production cross sections begin to become comparable to the pair production ( via qcd ) cross sections , such that the latter dominate for small enough diquark couplings and masses . for example , with a unit coupling between the charm and top quarks , table [ xsections14tev ] shows that ( associated ) single production of the diquark dominates for masses above 400 gev ( for both 7 and 14 tev lhc cm energies ) , while for a coupling of 0.1 , pair production dominates all the way up to a tev .",
    "alternatively , for a diquark coupled to strange and bottom quarks , single production dominates above 400 gev at 7 tev ( 600 gev at 14 tev ) , even for a coupling as small as 0.1 .    in the ( associated ) single production channel",
    ", diquarks present an interesting new signal in the form of a resonance between a heavy - flavour and a light - flavour jet . as previous authors have discussed ,",
    "these may be searched for directly @xcite , or , for example , as anomalous excesses in the @xmath94 @xcite or @xmath95 channels .",
    "since the cross - sections can be so large , such new physics may also be able to profit from the use of charm - tagging .",
    "the presence of heavy flavour in the final state also allows for the possibility of determining whether a produced resonance coupled to a heavy quark or a heavy anti - quark , for the case of final states involving @xmath98 , @xmath72 , and possibly @xmath80 . with it comes the possibility of distinguishing quark - quark from quark - antiquark resonances .",
    "for example , for a diquark coupled to up quarks with the inverted hierarchy , single production of a diquark resonance at the lhc arises predominantly via a @xmath99 initial state ( rather than @xmath100 ) and hence leads to a @xmath99 final state , with a predominance of @xmath80 over @xmath101 .",
    "but for a neutral quark - antiquark resonance , one would expect equal numbers of @xmath80 and @xmath101 in the final state , while an electrically - charged quark - antiquark resonance would yield a predominance of @xmath101 in the final state .",
    "the differences arise because a diquark or a charged @xmath97 resonance carries a conserved quantum number ( electric charge or baryon number ) , whereas a neutral @xmath97 resonance does not .",
    "one may use the same trick for a resonance with the perverted hierarchy produced in association with a heavy quark or antiquark , by focussing on the heavy quark or antiquark in the final state that pairs up with the light quark to form the resonance .",
    "for the normal hierarchy , even in the case of a diquark coupled to @xmath102 one may hope to distinguish it from a real quark - antiquark resonance in associated production , notwithstanding the fact that the proton contains comparable fractions of @xmath71 and @xmath103 : in the case of a diquark , the final state will always contain a @xmath98 and a @xmath104 , whilst a real quark - antiquark resonance will lead to equal fractions of same- and opposite - sign @xmath105 final states .",
    "the origin of flavour structure remains one of the outstanding puzzles of particle physics . and",
    "yet , it seems at first that sub - tev new physics has limited prospects for giving us further clues .",
    "the barrage of flavour - violating and @xmath106-violating experimental tests are so constraining that the safest course for new physics is to be predominantly  flavour - blind \" , with perhaps small flavour - dependent couplings affecting decays .",
    "we have argued that new scalars with substantial diquark couplings represent a striking exception , and a special opportunity for the tevatron and lhc to uncover new flavour physics .",
    "our conclusion is based on a judgement on the most plausible and broadly - defined expectation for the flavour dependence of the diquark couplings , namely that they are hierarchical in the same gauge basis as the sm higgs yukawa couplings are , but perhaps with a very different hierarchical pattern .",
    "such a structure fits naturally into the dominant uv flavour paradigms .",
    "we have performed a comprehensive set of estimates based on this structure and demonstrated that several species of diquark can satisfy all flavour and @xmath106 constraints , while still having at least one coupling strong enough to play a role in their production .",
    "some of these cases , diquarks with @xmath107 or @xmath108 quantum numbers , can only satisfy the constraints if they are roughly hierarchical in the same way as sm yukawa couplings , namely with the strongest couplings to the third generation and roughly ckm - like suppressions to other generations .",
    "colour - triplet diquarks with @xmath64 quantum numbers may exhibit the greatest variety of behaviours , with the strongest couplings between first and third , or first and second , or second and third generations , given the rough flavour structure we denoted as chiral hierarchy , a class of compelling flavour structures emerging from either froggatt - nielsen or extra - dimensional mechanisms .",
    "colour - triplet diquarks with either @xmath64 or @xmath65 quantum numbers can also have their strongest couplings to first and second generations with roughly ckm - like suppressions to the third .",
    "curiously , the bounds are weakest when the largest coupling involves the first and second generations , even though the bounds are strongest for processes involving these same quarks externally .",
    "it is also possible that some of these observations can be extended to some @xmath22-parity violating supersymmetric theories , but this remains for future work .    the life of a hadron machine , such as the tevatron or lhc , inevitably involves several tentative signals and anomalies , some of which may emerge as true signals of new physics . while such anomalies certainly need close experimental scrutiny",
    ", it is also invaluable to consider at early stages what new physics might underlie them , because it typically indicates where else experiments can look for corroboration .",
    "this back - and - forth between experiment and phenomenological modeling has taken place in the course of past anomalies , and should continue going into the lhc era .",
    "some of the tentative signals have in the past , and will no doubt in the future , suggest new physics coupling directly to quarks .",
    "it is at this point that theorists will need to consider the connections between new physics and quarks that can plausibly be in accord with low - energy flavour and @xmath106 tests .",
    "as we have argued , it is precisely here that diquark scalars come into their own , and the present paper can serve as a valuable resource .",
