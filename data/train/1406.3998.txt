    "generalized @xmath2-gons were introduced by tits in a famous work on triality @xcite of 1959 , in order to propose an axiomatic and combinatorial treatment for semisimple algebraic groups ( including chevalley groups and groups of lie type ) of relative rank @xmath0 .",
    "they are the central rank @xmath0 incidence geometries , and the atoms of the more general `` tits - buildings . ''",
    "if the number of elements of a generalized @xmath2-gon is finite , a celebrated result of feit and higman @xcite guarantees that @xmath2 is restricted to the set @xmath3 .",
    "note that projective planes are nothing else than generalized @xmath4-gons .",
    "generalized @xmath5-gons are also called _ generalized quadrangles _ , and certainly in the finite case , they are considered as being the main players in the class of generalized @xmath2-gons , and one of the most studied types of incidence geometries .    the most fruitful way to construct finite generalized quadrangles is through a now standard group coset geometry construction , in which a group @xmath6 provided with certain sets of subgroups @xmath7 @xmath8 and satisfying some strong intersection properties , is used to represent a generalized quadrangle .",
    "such a system of groups @xmath9 is called a _ kantor family _ for @xmath6 , and the defining properties are as follows .    * for some @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , each @xmath13 has order @xmath14 and each @xmath15 has order @xmath16 . * for each @xmath17 ( in @xmath18 ) , we have @xmath19 . * for distinct @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( in @xmath18 )",
    ", we have @xmath22 . * for distinct @xmath17 and @xmath23 ( in @xmath18 ) , we have @xmath24 .",
    "generic points of the quadrangle are elements of the group , generic lines are left ( or right | the choice does not change the isomorphism class of the geometry ) cosets of the subgroups of type @xmath13 , and some other special points and lines exist .",
    "a fundamental feature of this construction is that @xmath6 naturally acts as an automorphism group of the geometry , sharply transitively on the generic points .",
    "see @xcite for the details . call generalized quadrangles with such a group coset representation `` elation generalized quadrangles '' ( `` egqs '' ) ; the group @xmath6 is the _ elation group _ , and there is a special point @xmath25 through which all the lines are fixed by @xmath6 ( the `` elation point '' ) .    in the long literature of generalized quadrangles , it has appeared that one special type of egq plays a central role .",
    "such egqs are called _ skew translation generalized quadrangles _ ( `` stgqs '' ) , and they are specializations of egqs in the sense that @xmath25 satisfies an additional combinatorial property called  regularity . \" except for the quadrangles associated to hermitian varieties in @xmath5-dimensional projective space , all known classes of generalized quadrangles are stgqs , up to a combination of duality and payne - integration .",
    "this observation strongly motivates the necessity to understand stgqs , and perhaps aiming for classification results in every which way . only very partially , mostly in an influential paper by payne @xcite ,",
    "such results have been obtained for particular types of stgqs up till recently | see also  [ hpmgq ] .",
    "this classifcation program is the main purpose of this note .",
    "in fact , more precisely , we want to understand the category @xmath26 , where objects are triples @xmath27 , with @xmath28 an stgq , and @xmath29 a regular elation point with respect to an elation group @xmath6 .",
    "morphisms are natural : if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then @xmath32 consists of morhisms @xmath33 which map @xmath29 to @xmath34 and @xmath6 to @xmath35 ( the latter meaning that for @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) . for now , we imagine the stgqs being finite ( although the infinite case should eventually be handled as well ) .",
    "several subtleties arise :    * _ one _ fixed stgq @xmath28 could have _ several _ ( collinear ) elation points @xmath29 and @xmath34 ( if the points would be non - collinear , a classification of such stgqs is known @xcite ) - it can be easily shown however that there _ always _ exists automorphisms @xmath38 of @xmath28 mapping @xmath29 to @xmath34 ; * even if one fixes the couple @xmath39 , by recent work of rostermundt and independently the author of this paper , see @xcite , it is known that examples exist which have _ different _ , even _",
    "non - isomorphic _ elation groups @xmath6 and @xmath35 . as @xmath40 , @xmath27 and @xmath41 can not be elements of the same isomorphism class in @xmath26 .",
    "so classifying isomorphism classes in @xmath26 is a strictly finer job than `` just '' classifying isomorphism classes of stgqs .",
    "the examples of stgqs in ( b ) arise as the rational points and lines on a hermitian variety in @xmath42 ( @xmath43 a power of @xmath0 ) ( the point @xmath29 is arbitrary due to the transitivity of its automorphism group ) .",
    "this quadrangle is denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "payne asked in 2004 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) whether these examples are the _ only ( finite ) stgqs _ with different elation groups for the same point .",
    "we will come back to this question in the last section of this paper .",
    "in this paper , a _ generalized quadrangle _ ( `` gq '' ) is a point - line incidence geometry @xmath45 for which the following axioms are satisfied :    * @xmath28 contains no ordinary @xmath21-gon ( as a subgeometry ) , for @xmath46 ; * any two elements @xmath47 are contained in some ordinary @xmath5-gon in @xmath28 ; * there exists an ordinary @xmath48-gon in @xmath28 .    here , @xmath49 is the point set , @xmath50 the line set , both non - empty and disjoint , and @xmath51 is a symmetric relation on @xmath52 called `` incidence , '' which tells us how points and lines are related .",
    "so @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , means that @xmath56 is incident with @xmath57 ( and @xmath57 is incident with @xmath56 ) .",
    "an `` ordinary @xmath4-gon '' ( e.g. ) is a set of three points , two by two collinear but not all incident with the same line .    by ( iii )",
    ", generalized quadrangles have at least three points per line and three lines per point .",
    "note that points and lines play the same role in the axioms ; this is the principle of `` duality . ''",
    "all generalized quadrangles have an _ order _",
    "@xmath58 ; there exist constants @xmath59 such that the number of points incident with a line is @xmath60 , and the number of lines incident with a point is @xmath61 , cf .",
    "see also @xcite for a detailed discussion regarding parameters of generalized @xmath2-gons .",
    "note that an ordinary quadrangle is just a `` generalized quadrangle without ( iii ) , '' of order @xmath62 | we call such a subgeometry also `` apartment '' ( of @xmath28 ) .",
    "an _ automorphism _ of a generalized quadrangle @xmath45 is a bijection of @xmath63 which preserves @xmath49 , @xmath50 and incidence .",
    "the full set of automorphisms of a gq forms a group in a natural way | the _ automorphism group _ of @xmath28 , denoted @xmath64 .",
    "it is one of its most important invariants .",
    "in @xcite , tits proved roughly that there is a one - to - one correspondence between buildings of irreducible spherical type and rank @xmath65 , and the algebraic absolutely simple groups of relative rank @xmath66 . in order to have a similar statement in the rank @xmath0 case",
    "| the case of generalized @xmath2-gons that is to say | one must impose an extra condition , called the _",
    "moufang condition_. we describe it for generalized quadrangles .",
    "let @xmath67 be an apartment of a gq @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath68 of @xmath67 is a set of @xmath48 different elements @xmath69 in @xmath67 such that @xmath70 ( where the indices are taken in @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 are the _ extremal elements _ of @xmath68 .",
    "there are two types of roots , depending on whether the extremal elements are lines or points ; in the second case we speak of _ dual roots _ to make a distinction between the types . also , a ( dual ) root @xmath68 without its extremal elements | the _ interior _ of @xmath68 | is denoted by @xmath73 and called ( dual ) _ i - root_.    if @xmath74 is a subgeometry of @xmath28 , by @xmath75}$ ] we denote the subgroup of the automorphism group @xmath64 of @xmath28 which fixes every line incident with a point of @xmath74 and every point incident with a line of @xmath74 . now a ( dual ) root @xmath68 is _ moufang _ if @xmath76}$ ] acts transitively on the apartments containing @xmath68 . in fact , @xmath76 } = : a(\\dot{\\gamma})$ ] then acts _ sharply _ transitively on these apartments .",
    "once a ( dual ) root @xmath68 is moufang , all ( dual ) roots with interior @xmath73 are also moufang , with respect to the same group @xmath77 .",
    "( the latter groups are uniquely defined by @xmath73 and the moufang property . ) in a natural way , we also use the terms `` moufang i - root '' and `` dual moufang i - root '' , and the elements of @xmath77 are called _ root - elations_.    now @xmath28 is _ half moufang _ if all roots or all dual roots are moufang .",
    "it is _ moufang _ if all roots _ and _ dual roots are .",
    "all moufang generalized quadrangles were classified in the classical work @xcite , as the main and hardest step in the classification of all moufang buildings of rank @xmath0 | see @xcite for a historical sketch . in the finite case ,",
    "this already followed from work of fong and seitz @xcite , see also chapter 8 - 9 of @xcite .",
    "historical details can be found in the survey @xcite ; see also @xcite .    in @xcite ( and the references therein ) ,",
    "the strength of the local automorphic theory for generalized quadrangles became clear : to eventually end up with a geometric treatment of the classification of moufang quadrangles , the authors developed a theory which studies local moufang conditions for quadrangles , and eventually the theory reached far beyond the eventual goal .",
    "one instance is the theory of egqs | see chapter 8 of @xcite and the recent monograph @xcite .",
    "other instances of local moufang theory are surveyed in , e.g. , @xcite , see also the more recent paper @xcite .",
    "an important class of stgqs consists of those stgqs ( called `` flock quadrangles , '' and introduced in @xcite ) which arise through an intricate construction as a group coset geometry , from a _ flock _ of a quadratic cone @xmath78 in @xmath79 ( @xmath80 a finite field ) .",
    "a _ flock _ is a partition of the @xmath80-rational points of @xmath81 into @xmath43 disjoint irreducible conics .    in the fundamental paper @xcite ,",
    "payne studied local moufang conditions in gqs , partly to understand and generalize flock quadrangles .",
    "this motivated him to introduce _ skew translation generalized quadrangles _",
    "( `` stgqs '' )",
    ". one can prove that if @xmath27 is an stgq of finite order @xmath58 , all dual i - roots on @xmath29 are _ moufang for the same group _",
    "@xmath82 ; this means that @xmath83 has size @xmath84 , and that all its elements fix every point collinear with @xmath29 .",
    "the elements of @xmath83 are called _ symmetries _ with center @xmath29 .",
    "the existence of @xmath83 forces @xmath29 to have a certain combinatorial property called _ regularity _ , and conversely , one can show that an egq with regular elation point is an stgq .    in @xcite",
    ", payne introduced and studied a particular class of stgqs , called `` mstgqs . ''",
    "they are stgqs @xmath27 with the following properties .",
    "* each i - root containing @xmath29 is moufang ( and the corresponding root group is a subgroup of @xmath6 ) . * a redundant property , since it follows from ( mstgq1 ) . * no line @xmath85 is the unique center of a triad @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "he then showed that all flock quadrangles are mstgqs , and defined his now famous `` property ( g ) '' @xcite .",
    "a combination of @xcite and @xcite eventually led to the discovery of most of the presently known examples of gqs of order @xmath88 .",
    "recall that all known finite generalized quadrangles except the hermitian quadrangles in projective @xmath5-space have the property that up to a combination of duality and payne - integration , they are stgqs .",
    "this observation follows from the main result of @xcite .    besides fundamental work in especially @xcite ,",
    "not much is known in the classification theory for stgqs .    by results of hachenberger @xcite and independently chen ( unpublished )     the parameters of a finite stgq",
    "are always power of the same prime .",
    "the _ general heisenberg group _ @xmath89 ( sometimes also written as @xmath90 if we do not want to specify @xmath43 ) of dimension @xmath91 over @xmath80 , with @xmath2 a positive integer , is the group of square @xmath92-matrices with entries in @xmath80 , of the following form ( and with the usual matrix multiplication ) :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 , @xmath95 and with @xmath96 being the @xmath97-identity matrix .",
    "the group @xmath98 is isomorphic to the group @xmath99 , where the group operation @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 ( here , @xmath102 is a notation for transposition ) .",
    "the following properties hold for @xmath98 ( defined over @xmath80 ) .",
    "* @xmath98 has exponent @xmath103 if @xmath104 with @xmath103 an odd prime ; it has exponent @xmath5 if @xmath43 is even .",
    "* the center of @xmath98 is given by @xmath105 .",
    "* @xmath106 = z = \\phi({\\mathcal{h}}_n)$ ] and @xmath98 is nilpotent of class @xmath0 ( @xmath107 is the _ frattini subgroup _ of @xmath108 , that is , the intersection of all its maximal subgroups ) .",
    "let @xmath109 be the elementary abelian @xmath103-group @xmath110 .",
    "the map @xmath111    @xmath112\\ ] ] naturally defines a non - singular bilinear alternating form over @xmath113 .",
    "so @xmath109 can be seen as a @xmath5-dimensional space over @xmath80 , and in the corresponding projective @xmath4-space over @xmath80 , @xmath111 defines a symplectic polar space @xmath114 of rank @xmath0 ( projective index @xmath115 ) . here",
    ", @xmath114 can be defined as the generalized quadrangle which arises as the points of @xmath116 , @xmath80 a finite field , together with the totally isotropic projective lines of a non - degenerate alternating bilinear form on @xmath116 .",
    "all its points are regular elation points .",
    "the importance of alternating forms in stgq theory can be read from the following theorem .",
    "its proof uses the connection explained in   [ fsp ] .",
    "suppose @xmath108 is a special @xmath103-group of order @xmath117 for which @xmath118 $ ] is elementary abelian of order @xmath43 .",
    "suppose @xmath108 admits a kantor family of type @xmath119 , and suppose @xmath111 defines a non - singular bilinear alternating form over @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath120 , and the corresponding generalized quadrangle @xmath28 of order @xmath119 is a flock quadrangle .",
    "roughly put ( see the citation @xcite for more details ) , if for an stgq @xmath27 , @xmath6 is isomorphic to a general heisenberg group , then @xmath28 is a flock quadrangle : @xmath121    so enough structural knowledge of the group in this case , leads to determination of @xmath28 .",
    "this result / idea is one of the main models for the classification started in @xcite .",
    "we are ready to describe several new results in stgq theory . some of them settle long - standing open problems .",
    "proofs will be published elsewhere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first result was obtained in 2009 , and already announced ( a.o . ) on the 2010 conference `` combinatorics 2010 '' in verbania .",

    "it can be found in the preprint @xcite .",
    "i explained several proofs of this result in a lecture at the `` buildings 2012 '' conference in mnster .",
    "if ( c ) is true for @xmath27 , a slightly more general version of the moufang property holds for any i - root containing @xmath29 .",

    "let @xmath127 .",
    "then @xmath28 has @xmath128 _ at @xmath57 _ , if for some @xmath53 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 is a normal subgroup of @xmath6 . in that case , @xmath130 is independent of the choice of @xmath56 .",
    "the stgq has @xmath128 if it has @xmath128 at every line on @xmath29 .",

    "this enables one to understand the elation groups much better | see @xcite .",
    "when the order is @xmath133 and @xmath84 is even , the situation is ( very ) different , and an altogether different approach is needed to attack this case .",
    "unfortunately ( depending on the viewpoint ) , not all stgqs have ( * ) at every line through the elation point ; a first class of counter examples ( related to suzuki groups ) is displayed in the preprint @xcite | see also  8.4 of @xcite . in @xcite it is conjectured that for a finite stgq @xmath27 , either zero , one or all lines incident with @xmath29 have ( * ) .",
    "let @xmath27 be an stgq , and let @xmath134 be the frattini subgroup of @xmath6 .",
    "define a point - line geometry @xmath135 as follows .",
    "its lines are the @xmath136-orbits on the lines incident with @xmath29 ( where the trivial orbit @xmath137 is excluded ) ; its points are the @xmath136-orbits in the set of points not collinear with @xmath29 .",
    "a point @xmath138 is incident with a line @xmath109 if at least one @xmath28-point of the orbit @xmath109 is collinear with some point of the orbit @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath138 then is incident with @xmath109 , it is easy to see that @xmath109 is surjectively projected on @xmath138 , so that for each @xmath139 , a @xmath135-point is incident with precisely one line which is a @xmath136-orbit on @xmath140 .",

    "it is then shown that @xmath27 always contains ideal sub stgqs ( that is , it contains sub stgqs containing @xmath29 and all the lines on @xmath29 ) . whence the parameters are always of type @xmath132 for this type of generic stgqs ."
