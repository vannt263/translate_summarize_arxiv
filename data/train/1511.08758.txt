    "many researchers @xcite have studied open ( infinite ) models of one - dimensional regular lattices , in which an impurity is introduced that allows for control over transport and closely related properties in the lattice .",
    "this has led us to consider the possibility that an impurity might be used to control transport even in disordered finite systems , with one question in mind : what type of transport would occur if the ordered lattice were replaced by a disordered one ?",
    "it is well - known that disorder in quantum systems produces anderson localization @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous theoretical and experimental studies on anderson localization @xcite . for example , on the theoretical side , it has been shown that in a one - dimensional lattice with random energies at each site , all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are localized @xcite .",
    "although this result indicates that there can be no electron conductance through an _",
    "infinite _ one - dimensional disordered lattice , sharp resonances at the band center have been noted @xcite .",
    "such resonances are required for electron transport .",
    "in fact , pendry @xcite has shown that it is possible to transmit an electron from one end of a disordered _ finite _ lattice to the other due to the presence of `` necklace states '' that serve as stepping - stones for the electron .",
    "necklace states also exist in optical systems @xcite .",
    "these states form a sub - band that can induce resonant transport similar to the energy band of an ordered lattice .",
    "resonances of finite disordered systems coupled to infinite reservoirs have been theoretically studied in @xcite .    extrapolating from these previous studies ,",
    "here we consider finite disordered lattices with a side - attached impurity ( `` t - junction '' ) .",
    "the impurity can be realized using a quantum dot , which constitutes a nano - control device .",
    "the properties of the dot can be altered through a gate potential allowing an experimentalist control over electron transport .",
    "varying the gate potential on the dot can be used to probe the spectrum and localization properties of the lattice . as we will show",
    ", we can indeed use an impurity to direct transport within a disordered lattice . in our theoretical study",
    "we will consider the case of zero temperature .",
    "therefore the transport we will discuss is different from variable - range hopping @xcite , which occurs at non - zero temperature .",
    "we will discuss possible extension of our work to the case of nonzero temperature in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "note that our lattice is finite , but large enough so that boundary effects are negligible .",
    "experimentally , effective 1-d systems can be synthesized by a variety of techniques @xcite , including lattice geometries that incorporate a side - attached quantum dot @xcite .",
    "randomized site potentials in a finite lattice might be obtained , for example , by varying segment lengths ( i.e. , growth times ) in gaas / gap superlattices assembled by laser - assisted catalytic growth @xcite .",
    "an effective side - attached dot could then potentially be realized by doping one such segment .",
    "while as far as we are aware there have been no studies on disordered models of electron transport incorporating a side - attached impurity , at least one experimental realization of a system similar to ours has been reported in ref .",

    "have recently been studied in finite , weakly disordered optical waveguide arrays @xcite .",
    "moreover , refs . @xcite have considered control of thermopower using a gate potential that shifts all the lattice energies at once .",
    "we will consider the motion of the electron from the impurity to the lattice and back .",
    "the initial state is that in which the electron is completely localized in the side impurity .",
    "hereafter this state will be referred to as the unperturbed _ impurity state _ ; this state is an eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian , corresponding to the case where the impurity is decoupled from the lattice .",
    "the coupling will allow the electron to transfer between the impurity and the lattice .",
    "we will treat the energy of the impurity as a tunable parameter .",
    "we will study how this parameter influences the transport of the electron from the impurity to the lattice , or vice versa .",
    "our main finding is that for certain impurity energies the electron can jump to small regions in the lattice ; these regions are localization centers of anderson - localized states whose energy is matched by the impurity energy .",
    "these together with the impurity states form hybrid states that are similar to the necklace states studied by pendry .",
    "interference between the hybrid states induces rabi - like oscillations of the electron survival probability at the impurity .",
    "hence , the electron alternates positions between the impurity and the localization centers of the lattice states hybridized with the impurity state .",
    "the rabi - like oscillations occur in the vicinity of avoided crossings in the energy spectrum of the system ; these avoided crossings are induced by the interaction between the impurity and the lattice .",
    "the center of the avoided crossings signals the appearance of maximally hybridized states .",
    "experimental observation of avoided crossings and hybrid states similar to ours was the main focus of ref .",

    "the new aspect of our study relative to ref .",
    "@xcite is the description of the time evolution of the electron associated with these avoided crossings and the possibility of tuning the impurity energy to predictably route electrons to different regions of the lattice .",
    "in addition , we will also point out that the range of electron transport can be larger than the localization length of the hybridized states , as long as the impurity energy is precisely tuned to match the center of the avoided crossing .",
    "we will focus our attention on rabi - like oscillations involving only two or three hybridized states .",
    "oscillations involving many hybridized states produce an erratic pattern of motion , which is less suitable for controlled transport .",

    "so far we have discussed how the impurity s energy can be tuned to alter the spectrum of the lattice and form hybrid states localized at both lattice and impurity sites . here",
    "we demonstrate how this tuning can be used to direct transport within the disordered lattice .",
    "we begin by considering the time evolution of our system for fixed values of @xmath3 .",

    ". we can understand this as due to a destructive interference between hybrid eigenstates , such as the ones shown in figure [ pert ] , whose similar amplitudes at the impurity add with opposite phase and cancel each other out .",
    "thus by maximizing hybridization we are able to momentarily confine the electron in the lattice .",

    "thus we have demonstrated the impurity energy s ability to control electron transport within our finite disordered lattice . by tuning @xmath3",
    "we can force the electron to oscillate between the impurity site and specific groups of localized sites as time progresses .",
    "the electron oscillations described in the previous section involved al states that are close to the attachment site .",
    "therefore the spatial range of the oscillations was limited to the anderson localization length of the al states .",
    "however , in general , it is possible to select values of @xmath63 that allow the impurity state to hybridize with an al state far from the attachment site . to see this ,",
    "consider that an al state with a given inverse localization length @xmath19 has an amplitude given approximately by the exponential function @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the point of localization ( maximum amplitude ) .",

    "the larger @xmath128 is , the smaller the gap at the avoided crossing . in figures [ spec ] and [ spec88 ] one can see such avoided crossings with very small gap ; the resolution of these figures makes it seem that in many places the lines are simply crossing , but in fact these are all `` microscopic '' avoided crossings .",

    "the presence of the side impurity significantly impacts the spectral properties of the lattice , forming hybrid al / impurity states .",
    "we have treated the energy of the side impurity as a tunable parameter that selects which states become hybridized , thereby controlling the motion of the electron . in particular , the electron can be forced to periodically oscillate between the impurity site and specific groups of localized sites as time progresses .",
    "previously pendry has shown that transport can be achieved through a finite disordered chain by relying on hybridized al states that form a `` necklace '' through such a lattice . while this necklace of states forms a sub - band due to near - degeneracy that occurs by chance , in our model",
    "we demonstrate that a side - attached impurity can be used as a control device to intentionally select al sites according to specific hybridization characteristics that enable desired transport properties .",
    "although we have studied a simplified model , our results may serve as a starting point for the design of devices based on finite disordered lattices which attempt to route electrons .",
    "nano - designed transistors with disordered materials have already been proposed @xcite .",
    "using disorder to trap electrons within a given area could help combat issues with device miniaturization .",
    "moreover , lattices based on complex stacked t - junction structures may offer interesting possibilities for controlling or storing electrons .",
    "the finite size of disordered lattices we have considered may allow for nonzero temperature operation in realistic devices , because the energy - level spacings can be larger than the thermal excitation energies ; this would allow the system to behave similarly to the zero - temperature case . assuming that the width of the energy band is of the order of the width without disorder , the average level - spacing is @xmath131 . a rough estimation of the maximum operational temperature",
    "would then be given by @xmath132 .",
    "as a reference , for a disordered lattice with @xmath133 , having @xmath134 would require @xmath135 ev . an issue that deserves further investigation is the following : the level spacings between hybrid states at avoided crossings can be much smaller than @xmath131 , so thermal excitation could induce transitions between these states , similar to variable - range hopping .",
    "this would modify the simple rabi oscillations discussed in the present paper for @xmath136 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found experimentally that carrier transport in a disordered superlattice becomes thermally activated around @xmath137 .",
    "our results are applicable to disordered optical or microwave lattices , such as the microwave lattice of ref .",
    "@xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "for this type of lattice , temperature effects are much less important than for electron lattices , so our results regarding the rabi oscillations and far - transport could be more readily tested on this type of systems .",
    "a possible extension of our work is to make the impurity energy time - dependent and study the electron motion in this case .",
    "as shown in @xcite disordered optical systems systems with time - evolving disorder can produce `` hyper - transport '' of light , which is faster than ballistic transport .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this can be achieved in the case of electron transport .",
