    "naturally occurring surfaces are not fully planar .",
    "they often show some degree of roughness at the scale of optical wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "this causes light incident upon them to be partly reflected away from the specular direction .",
    "the concept of gloss is related to the amount of light scattered into a small angular interval about the specular direction . when designing and manufacturing materials for which gloss is considered an essential parameter , it is desirable to know how this quantity is related to the surface topography , and in particular , to the parameters used to characterize them .",
    "gloss does in principle depend on any process that can scatter light away from the specular direction ; _ e.g. _ surface and bulk randomness . in the present work ,",
    "we will limit ourselves to situations where the bulk randomness can be ignored relative to the surface randomness .",
    "the gloss for randomly rough surfaces was recently studied experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this latter study ,",
    "alexander - katz and barrera derived , within the scalar kirchhoff approximation , an expression for gloss for two types of surface height - height correlations ( exponential and gaussian ) .",
    "these authors stressed that it is important to _ not _ neglect the incoherent contribution to gloss ( stemming from the diffusely scattered light ) , since it may be significant .",
    "the publications  @xcite are among the few studies found in the literature where also the surface correlation is included when trying to estimate gloss from the surface roughness parameters .    in this paper , we reexamine gloss of a randomly rough surface . an expression for this industrially relevant quantity is derived within the framework of phase - perturbation theory  @xcite , for a general height correlation function . like the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the surface correlation is important for gloss in general .",
    "however , contrary to alexander - katz and barrera  @xcite , it turns out that in our formulation it is not the product of the correlation length and a lateral momentum variable ( collection angle ) that acts as one of the reduced variables for the estimation of gloss from surface parameters .",
    "instead , one finds that the corresponding reduced variable depends on the _ functional _ form of the correlation function satisfied by the surface roughness , and not only its correlation length . only in some limiting cases",
    "do we recover results consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when applying approximate expressions to calculate important optical quantities , it is of utmost importance to be able to have knowledge about the range of validity of the expression used . in order to address this crucial point , we use results from rigorous monte carlo simulations to gauge the quality of the proposed approximate analytical expression to gloss . to the best of out knowledge ,",
    "such extensive comparison to rigorous simulation results has never been reported before .",
    "the main reason for considering a one - dimensional scattering geometry was to enable such a comparison .",
    "rigorous simulation in this context of a two - dimensional geometry is out of reach for todays computer power .",
    "in the optical industry , _ gloss _ is used extensively to quantify the visual appearance and functional properties of various materials  @xcite .",
    "however , it does not show the same prominence in the optics branch of science where it is not - so - often considered .",
    "in fact , the term does not even have a rigorous scientific definition , and it comes in several `` flavors '' : specular and wide - angle gloss referring to different angles of incidence ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 )  @xcite . for instance , the way that gloss is quantified and measured ( by gloss - meters ) depends on industrial standards  @xcite that are different in , say , north - america and europe .",
    "however , in essence , what the gloss numbers quantify , is how well a material scatter light incident upon it into the specular direction .",
    "depending on the level of surface topography and/or inhomogeneties in the bulk of the material , a fraction of the incident light will be scattered into directions other than the specular .",
    "such mechanisms will contribute to reduce the gloss numbers of such materials .    in this study",
    ", we will define gloss , @xmath3 , as the fraction of the incident light that is scattered into a small angular interval , @xmath4 , about the specular direction .",
    "this definition is not identical to any of the industrial standards in common use today  @xcite .",
    "however , it shares the main characteristics of these standards , and for appropriate choices of the angular interval can be related to them .",
    "furthermore , we will be somewhat unorthodox and also consider `` gloss '' in transmission , even though it is not a commonly used term .",
    "the concept of _ haze _ is more customarily considered in this context  @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath15    .",

    "first , gloss can be expressed in terms of _ two dimensionless quantities _ : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the former is the product of the root - mean - square roughness associated with the surface topography and the perpendicular momentum transfer of the scattering ( or transmission ) process into the specular direction .",
    "hence , it does depend on the `` amount '' of roughness _ but not _ on how it is being correlated along the interface . in quite a few studies of gloss for rough surfaces ,",
    "this is the only factor considered .",
    "the latter quantity , @xmath44 , on the other hand , depends on the form of the power spectrum and thus , indirectly , on the correlation length .",
    "notice , however , that it is only the functional form of the power spectrum @xmath45 around zero ( lateral ) momentum transfer that enters into the expression for gloss via @xmath46 .",
    "second , the dependence of gloss on the angle of incidence _ only _ enters through the perpendicular momentum transfer present in @xmath42 ( with @xmath32 ) .    for completeness , and to facilitate the use of these approximate expressions for gloss , we also give the full expressions in terms of the `` defining '' quantities .",
    "gloss in reflection can be expressed as    @xmath47 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while in transmission one has @xmath48 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in obtaining the expression for @xmath49 it has been used that @xmath50 for the specular direction in transmission .",
    "previously , alexander - katz and barrera  @xcite , reported while using scalar kirchhoff theory , that the reduced variables for gloss ( in reflection ) were @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since in the radiative region  @xcite @xmath53 , it follows readily that @xmath54 .",
    "however , we do not in general find that @xmath55 scales like @xmath56 ( the product of the correlation length and the collection angle ) . only in the limit @xmath57 , for which @xmath58 , do we recover the scaling reported by alexander - katz and barrera  @xcite .",
    "notice that for small collection angles one has @xmath59 .",
    "however , below we will see that when the ratio @xmath60 becomes rather small , the phase perturbative approximation to gloss becomes less accurate . over the range of validity of this approximation we therefore find that for a one - dimensional roughness the reduced correlation dependent variable for gloss is @xmath55 and not simply the product of the correlation length and the collection angle as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will now address the accuracy of the analytic expressions for gloss ( [ eq : gloss - final - all ] ) derived in this work .",
    "this will be achieved by comparing these expressions to what can be obtained from rigorous monte carlo simulations  @xcite that in principle takes _ all _ higher order scattering processes into account .",
    "the simulation results using an exponential correlation function ( and assuming @xmath61-polarization for the incident light ) are presented in fig .",

    "they demonstrate that the approximate expressions are rather good even for relatively rough surfaces .",
    "furthermore , they seem to produce the best results for @xmath62 ( and @xmath63 not too large ) for which one naively would expect single scattering to mainly contribute . hence , for rough , shortly correlated surfaces where @xmath64 the approximate expressions presented herein are no longer adequate .",
    "comparable , or better , results have been obtained for @xmath65-polarization .",
    "there is one important difference to be noticed between the results for @xmath61 and @xmath65-polarization . in the former state of polarization ,",
