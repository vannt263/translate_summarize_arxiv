    "three approaches are normally used to determine stellar mass loss rates , @xmath7s .",
    "all assume that the wind is homogeneous and spherically symmetric ( ss ) with a single , monotonic velocity law , and all _ should _ agree .",
    "the three approaches are : + _ 1 .",
    "continuum excess from free - free emission .",
    "_ this samples the outer wind ( the exact radius depends on wavelength ) , where it becomes optically thick to free - free emission .",
    "it is only detectable for massive winds in nearby stars .",
    "the radio wavelengths are considered `` cleanest '' , because , in contrast to the ir / fir , massive winds become optically thick at large radii ( @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 , a constant .",
    "this makes @xmath10 , independent of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , no photospheric correction is needed .",
    "however , the radio flux can be non - thermal , so observations at multiple wavelengths are required to determine the spectral index of the emission .",
    "+ _ 2 . h@xmath0 emission .",
    "_ this samples the inner wind and is easily observed . for massive winds , h@xmath0 emission",
    "is related to @xmath7 . however , the exact form of the observed h@xmath0 profile depends upon the @xmath12 departure coefficient for h in the wind and this , in turn , depends upon : the photospheric radiation field ; the diffuse radiation field of the wind ; and the wind velocity law in the acceleration region .",
    "the shape of the `` photospheric '' h@xmath0 profile is also required , and the observed @xmath13 can be strongly variable .",
    "nevertheless , relatively sophisticated models for h@xmath0 formation exist ( e.g. , repolust et al .  2004 ) , and can provide reasonable agreement between available radio and h@xmath0 @xmath7s when h@xmath0 emission is strong .",
    "_ 3 . uv resonance lines . _",
    "these sample the entire wind .",
    "their shapes are determined by the radial optical depth of the wind , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the abundance of element @xmath17 and its ionization fraction for stage @xmath18 .",
    "however observations of a dominant ion ( @xmath19 ) , of known abundance are required to estimate @xmath7 directly , and the wind lines of abundant , dominant ions are saturated in winds massive enough to be detected in the radio or to have reliable h@xmath0 @xmath7s .",
    "_ fuse _ gives access to p  v  @xmath20 .",
    "p  v is a surrogate for c  iv ( massa et al .",
    "2003 ) and @xmath21 is expected for both ions in mid - o star winds . unlike @xmath22 , @xmath23 over the life of an o star .",
    "furthermore , for scaled solar abundances , @xmath24c  iv@xmath25p  v@xmath26 , so to _ detect _ p  v , @xmath24c  iv@xmath27 and saturated  as is the case for stars with detectable radio fluxes and strong h@xmath0 emission .",
    "* p v in lmc o stars : * the first large scale _ fuse _ study of p  v was by massa et al .",
    "they performed sei ( lamers et al .",
    "1987 ) fits to p  v wind lines , determining @xmath28 for 25 lmc o stars .",
    "they then used @xmath7s predicted by the vink et al .",
    "( 2001 ) theory and @xmath29solar to find that @xmath30 peaked between 4550  kk , as expected , but with a peak value @xmath31 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this result implies a factor of 7 or more discrepancy between the expected and observed @xmath7s .",
    "there are three possible explanations for this result : + _ 1 . _",
    "the lmc p abundance scales differently from other elements , + _ 2 . _",
    "the theoretical @xmath7s are incorrect for the lmc , or + _ 3 . _",
    "the winds are not homogeneous and ss , but strongly clumped or structured . + * p v in galactic o stars ( preliminary results ) : * the galactic @xmath32 is well determined ( e.g. , catanzaro et al .",
    "2003 ) , so abundance is not an issue for the galaxy . we are currently analyzing p  v in _ copernicus _ , _ orfeus _ and _ fuse _ data for stars with radio and/or h@xmath0 @xmath7 estimates .",
    "this eliminates the need for model @xmath7s to derive @xmath2 for p  v , and determines how well different mass loss rate indicators agree .",
    "so far , we have analyzed 30 stars ( 11 more will be observed by _ fuse _ ) , and the results are shown in figure  2 .",
    "these results are effectively identical to those from the lmc ( fig .  1 ) , implying the same conclusions .",
    "* an erroneous p abundance is not the cause of the small lmc @xmath33s .",
    "* strong clumping / porosity must be the root of the problem .",
    "* large scale clumping can also strongly affect the radio and h@xmath0 @xmath7s , so these should be re - evaluated . *",
    "the different measures of @xmath7 are sensitive to different aspects of the wind flow , so bringing them all into agreement ( together with the x - ray and o  vi wind line observations ) will provide powerful constraints on models of how the winds are structured .",
