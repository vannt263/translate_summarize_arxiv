    "double @xmath0 hypernuclei , nuclear systems containing two @xmath0 hyperons , have been retaining much interest @xcite . as the only observed example of a multiply strange system",
    "they give us unique opportunity to study @xmath7 interaction in nuclear medium and to test existing models of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "moreover , studies of @xmath7 hypernuclei are closely related to searches for @xmath8 dibaryon , known as the h particle @xcite . up to now , only a few events have been identified ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) @xcite indicating a strong attractive @xmath7 interaction .",
    "the analysis of the data yields the @xmath7 bond energy @xmath9  mev , where @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the binding energy of @xmath0 and a pair of @xmath0 s , respectively .",
    "calculations of @xmath12 have been performed in various non - relativistic approaches @xcite , by using effective interactions or g - matrices together with cluster or three - body models ( a fair list of early works is given in [ 8 ] .",
    "in particular , the d model of the nijmegen @xmath7 interactions was shown to yield results in good agreement with experiments .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate @xmath3 within the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory .",
    "to some extend , this theory is less appropriate than three - body calculations to the problem of @xmath3 , since it replaces the basic two - body interactions by coupling to meson fields .",
    "however , our aim is to study the possibility to put the rmf on reasonable grounds , since a sensible estimate of @xmath3 has implications on the calculations of multi-@xmath0 systems within this model .",
    "the rmf approach has been applied to hypernuclear systems containing various amounts of hyperons ( see for instance @xcite ) . while the original @xmath13 model well reproduces spectra of single @xmath0 hypernuclei ( in particular , small spin - orbit splitting ) its straightforward application to bound systems with two @xmath0 particles failed .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath13 model can not provide a sufficiently attractive @xmath7 interaction and , consequently , the binding energy of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei is substantially underestimated .",
    "considering the lorentz - tensor @xmath0-@xmath14 coupling @xcite , which allows for stronger couplings of @xmath0 to mesons , could lead to a stronger @xmath7 interaction .",
    "detailed calculations revealed , however , that stronger @xmath0-meson couplings do not necessarily result in a larger value of @xmath3@xcite .",
    "table  1 displays a typical example of rmf results for coupling constant ratios @xmath15 and 2/3 , compared to the empirical data .",
    "quite recently , schaffner et al@xcite proposed to strengthen the @xmath7 binding by introducing an additional @xmath16 interaction mediated by two strange mesons ( scalar @xmath1 and vector @xmath2 ) that couple exclusively to hyperons .",
    "the coupling of hyperons to the @xmath2 mesons was assumed to satisfy the su(6 ) relations , whereas the coupling to @xmath1 was fixed by fitting to the estimated potential well depth for the @xmath0 hyperon in a medium of other @xmath0 hyperons , @xmath17  mev . the improved rmf model ( @xmath18 ) increases the value @xmath19 to about 3  mev ( from the original @xmath20  mev ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that the discrepancy between the calculated and empirical values of @xmath3 can not be attributed entirely to the missing meson exchanges between the two hyperons . to support this argument",
    ", we display in table 2 @xmath21 calculated for ordinary nuclei with two nucleons outside a spherical core . here",
    "@xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the separation energy of the nucleon ( 2 nucleons ) .",
    "( note that unlike the binding energies b in case of hypernuclei , separation energies s are used in nuclear mass tables @xcite . )",
    "the rmf results are compared to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the model again fails to give the observed @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", possible additional mesons would have to be introduced from the beginning ( fit to nuclear matter data ) and thus are not expected to change the results . comparing the rmf and experimental values from table 2 it is reasonable to expect a sizable contribution to @xmath3 coming from other effects neglected in the mean field approximation @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we aim to develop a simple model , which allows us to include the two-@xmath0 correlation energy .",
    "this is a first step towards estimating what fraction is left for the contribution from @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . in this way , we are able to extract information about their couplings to the @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "it has to be stressed that the present work neglects @xmath0n correlations , which could lower the coupling constants and thus affect the @xmath7 correlation energy .",
    "similarly , the lack of spin dependence of the @xmath0-nucleus potential derived from the rmf may be of importance .",
    "we will address these questions in section iii , where we show on simple estimates that the present model yields a reasonable limit to the @xmath7 correlation energy .",
    "the model used in our study is described in the following section . in section 3 ,",
    "we present results of the calculations .",
    "we show that the correlation energy between two @xmath0 s is very sensitive to the rmf parametrization used .",
    "though for quark model inspired values of @xmath0 couplings the correlation energy contributes substantionally to @xmath3 it is not sufficient to account for the empirical values .",
    "indeed , extra meson exchanges proposed by schaffner et al , specific to the hyperon ( @xmath0 ) sector are required . taking su(6 )",
    "value for the @xmath25 coupling constant @xmath26 we determine the @xmath27 coupling @xmath28 by fitting the experimental data from observed 2@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "predictions are then made for @xmath3 in heavier hypernuclear systems .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "a starting point to describe the relativistic system of two interacting particles inside the nuclear medium would be either the covariant bethe - salpeter equation @xcite or the manifestly covariant formalism with constraints @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complexity of these approaches , most of the works related to this subject are based on the phenomenological equal - time two - body dirac equation @xcite .",
    "although not fully covariant , it has proved very useful in understanding two - electron atoms and two - quark systems .",
    "we will therefore adopt this approach here , as well .    in order to write down the dirac equation for two @xmath0 particles in a hypernucleus , we consider these two hyperons moving in the scalar ( @xmath29 ) and vector ( @xmath30 ) mean fields brought about by the nucleons . in addition",
    ", the hyperons interact with each other .",
    "let s suppose that the interaction is mediated by the exchange of the scalar @xmath31 and vector @xmath32 mesons ( for simplicity , we neglect all the other possible meson exchanges )",
    ". in accordance with the above assumptions the time - independent dirac equation we propose , neglecting retardation effects , has the following form :    @xmath33 + \\beta_1\\beta_2\\sigma_{s\\lambda}(\\vec r_1,\\vec r_2 ) + \\sigma_{0\\lambda}(\\vec r_1,\\vec r_2)\\big]\\ \\varphi_{\\lambda } ( \\vec r_1,\\vec r_2 ) & = 2e_\\lambda \\varphi_{\\lambda } ( \\vec r_1,\\vec r_2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 represents the self - energy of a @xmath0 particle due to its interaction with the nucleon fields .",
    "the scalar ( @xmath35 ) and time - like part of the vector interaction ( @xmath36 ) are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the scalar and time - like vector self - energies of the @xmath0 particles due to their mutual interaction . in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath42 fields",
    ", they read : @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "finaly , @xmath45 is a 16-component spinor ( labelled by two indices ) , representing the two-@xmath0 state .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath481,2 ) are the dirac matrices acting on the i - th spinor index .    the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 fulfil the klein - gordon equations with the nuclear scalar and vector densities as the source terms    @xmath51    @xmath52    here , the spinors @xmath53 represent the one - nucleon states .",
    "as stated above , each @xmath0 particle in addition moves in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 fields whose source is the second hyperon . in the approximation of heavy , static baryons the corresponding klein - gordon equations for @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath42 acquire the form :    @xmath54    @xmath55    if the @xmath7 interaction is neglected the dirac equation ( 1 ) reduces to two identical dirac equations , each being equivalent to the mean field approximation for a @xmath0 particle in a hypernucleus .    to proceed further we express the two-@xmath0 spinor in terms of its 4 large ( @xmath56 ) , 8 medium ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) and 4 small ( @xmath59 ) components @xcite",
    ":    @xmath60    if @xmath61 from eq.(8 ) is brought into the dirac equation ( 3 ) and the components @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 eliminated , the following equation for the components @xmath56 is obtained :    @xmath62 + \\sigma_0(\\vec r_1)+\\sigma_0(\\vec r_2 ) + \\sigma_{s\\lambda}(r)+\\sigma_{0\\lambda}(r)\\big ] \\psi_\\lambda ( \\vec r_1,\\vec r_2 ) & = 2\\epsilon_\\lambda \\psi_\\lambda ( \\vec r_1,\\vec r_2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the relative distance between two @xmath0 particles , @xmath68 .",
    "the equation ( 9 ) for @xmath69 is still rather complicated because @xmath70 depends on @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we simplify the solution by neglecting the radial dependence of @xmath70 and replacing @xmath73 by the ground state expectation value @xmath74 .",
    "this approximation leads to neglecting the spin - orbit interaction and terms that renormalize somewhat the central potential .",
    "however , since the spin - orbit interaction is very small for the @xmath0 hyperon this does not represent a serious drawback .",
    "the resulting ( schrdinger type ) equation for @xmath56 is then    @xmath75 \\label{sdl } + \\sigma_0(\\vec r_1)+\\sigma_0(\\vec r_2 ) + \\sigma_{s\\lambda}(r)+\\sigma_{0\\lambda}(r ) \\big]\\psi_\\lambda ( \\vec r_1,\\vec r_2 ) & = \\epsilon_\\lambda \\psi_\\lambda ( \\vec r_1,\\vec r_2)\\;\\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although at this stage , equation ( 10 ) can be solved by expanding @xmath69 in a convenient basis , it is still tedious enough that it is useful to look for further simplifications .",
    "the @xmath0 particle in a hypernucleus spends most of its time in a high density region , where the potential @xmath76 can be approximated rather accurately by a spherical harmonic oscillator @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we shall use both that the rmf reproduces the hypernuclear spectra with a great accuracy @xcite and that the potential seen by the @xmath0 is very close to the hamonic oscillator to get a practical solution of ( 10 ) . note that very similar approximations have been used in non - relativistic calculations .",
    "the @xmath78 and @xmath79 exchanges between @xmath0 hyperons ( eqs .",
    "6 and 7 ) give rise to an effective @xmath0-@xmath0 potential @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) which reduces to a difference of two yukawa forms :    @xmath82    above two approximations lead to the following replacement in the schrdinger - like equation ( 10 ) :    @xmath83    in fact , the oscillator depth @xmath84 and its frequency @xmath14 were not determined by fitting @xmath85 to @xmath76 but directly fitted to the experimental energy spectrum of the particular @xmath0 hypernucleus .",
    "the two coupling constants @xmath86 and @xmath87 from eq.(11 ) were chosen to reproduce the spectroscopic data in the relativistic mean field formalism @xcite , as accurately as possible , in the whole ensemble of single-@xmath0 hypernuclei known . with the above determined parameters , eq .",
    "( 10 ) allows us to estimate the correlation energy of the two hyperons , which is neglected in the mean field approximation .",
    "parameterizing the @xmath0 self - energies @xmath88 in terms of ho potentials enables to express the equation of motion ( 10 ) in jacobi coordinates ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 and separate the centre of mass coordinates from the relative ones . after straightforward manipulations",
    "the former equation ( 10 ) transforms into the following two equations :    @xmath92 \\psi_r(r ) = e_r \\psi_r(r)\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    @xmath93 \\psi_r(r ) = e_r \\psi_r(r)\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath94 , @xmath95 are the jacobi impulse operators and @xmath96 . if the harmonic oscillator parameters are fitted to eigenvalues of a single @xmath0 hypernucleus , ( taken either from rmf or from experiments )",
    "these two coupled equations yield a first approximation to the two @xmath0 binding energy @xmath97 .",
    "the correct value has to include at least two corrections : a modification of the harmonic oscillator parameters due to the additional @xmath0 and the increase of the core energy , the so - called re - arrangement energy .",
    "the re - arrangement energy can be estimated in the rmf approximation as a difference between the @xmath0 eigenvalue and binding energy @xmath98    the modification of the harmonic oscillator parameters due to the second @xmath0 can be neglected as it is expected to be negligible in comparison with the above @xmath99 .",
    "this is because , whereas all the core particles contribute to @xmath99 , only the added @xmath0 is affected by the change of the harmonic oscillator parameters .",
    "furthermore , one can expect that the re - arrangement energy of the 2 @xmath0 hypernucleus is approximately twice the one of the single @xmath0 hypernucleus .",
    "consequently , we obtain    @xmath100    the alternative and equivalent way to determine @xmath101 is to fit the harmonic oscillator parameters in such a way that the @xmath0 binding energy @xmath102 $ ] in the corresponding hypernucleus reproduces the empirical binding energies . now",
    "@xmath11 immediately incorporates @xmath99 , and similarly @xmath103 includes the re - arrangement of the core caused by the two @xmath0 particles @xmath104 . as a result ,",
    "relation ( 16 ) is fulfilled again .",
    "the model presented in the previous section was applied to calculation of @xmath3 for the following sample of double @xmath0 hypernuclei : @xmath105 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which includes the measured cases .",
    "fitting the ho parameters @xmath110   and @xmath84 requires two experimental values . starting from @xmath111   they are given by the 1s and 1p @xmath0 binding energies .",
    "for the three lightest elements , where the 1p level is unbound , we extrapolated the @xmath112 splitting from the c and o region .",
    "we used three different rmf models , namely hs model of horowitz and serot @xcite , and models l1 and l3 of lee et al .",
    "@xcite the masses and meson - nucleon coupling constants of @xmath29 and @xmath14 mesons are presented in table 3 .",
    "different parametrizations allowed us to study the dependence of @xmath3 on the mass of the @xmath29 meson @xmath113 .",
    "one would expect that the smaller values of @xmath113 ( t.e .",
    ", model l3 ) will give larger correlation energy and consequently larger @xmath3 .",
    "the couplings of the @xmath0 hyperon to the meson fields are often defined via coupling constant ratios @xmath114 , @xmath115 . for each of the above rmf parametrizations we used two coupling ratios @xmath116 ( a ) and 2/3 ( b ) . whereas the value of 2/3 is predicted by the constituent quark model , 1/3",
    "ratio was widely used in the pioneering rmf hypernuclear calculations .",
    "the corresponding @xmath117 was then chosen to fit the hypernuclear spectra @xcite .",
    "the ratios @xmath118 are included in the list of parameters in table 3 , as well .",
    "the @xmath3 corresponding to the different parametrizations of table  3 are displayed in table  4 .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath3 depends on the model used .",
    "the values of @xmath3 are larger for lower values of @xmath113 as predicted .",
    "in addition , @xmath3 is quite sensitive to the coupling ratios @xmath119 .",
    "whereas for @xmath120 there is hardly any improvement over the rmf values , 0.5 - 1.0 mev is gained with @xmath121 .",
    "the results of table  4 indicate also that including the correlation energy from the @xmath29 and @xmath14 exchange , though sizable in the case of @xmath122 , can not by itself account for empirical @xmath123  mev of the @xmath3 in light hypernuclei .",
    "note that the results of table  4 , for light nuclei , can not be compared directly to those of table  1 on a quantitative level , because of small differences used in each calculation .",
    "qualitatively , however , the strong dependence of the correlation energy on the strength of the @xmath14-coupling and its large incidence on @xmath3 for 2/3 can be taken for granted . therefore , according to the chosen parametrization , at least half of the empirical @xmath3 has to come from `` new '' meson exchanges that are not included in the original versions of rmf models .    in order to investigate the range of coupling constants needed to bring the calculated @xmath101 into agreement with experiments , we followed the work of schaffner et al @xcite and assumed scalar @xmath1 and vector @xmath2 meson fields .",
    "we addopted their meson masses , namely @xmath124 mev and @xmath125 mev , respectively .",
    "similarly the @xmath2 coupling is taken from the su(6 ) relations , @xmath126 .",
    "contrary to their work , the @xmath1 coupling is considered as a free parameter to be fitted to the empirical values of @xmath101 . since @xmath1 and @xmath2 act only between two @xmath0 s , they simply modify the potential @xmath127 to be used in ( 14 ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath3 as a function of @xmath128 are presented in fig .  1 for @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "use is made of the hs parametrization of the rmf , which stands roughly in between the two other cases @xmath132 and @xmath133 as for the magnitude of the predicted @xmath3 .",
    "the two sets of curves corresponding to @xmath134 1/3 and 2/3 intercept the domain defined by the experimental values at @xmath128 around 0.71 and 0.79 , respectively . in view of the large experimental errors ( table  1 )",
    "these values are only approximative .",
    "nevertheless , it means that inspite of the correlation effects taken into account , which reduce the short range repulsion effect , the largest repulsive @xmath119 implies the largest attractive @xmath128 coupling .    having fixed @xmath128 we performed the calculations for the set of double @xmath0 hypernuclei mentioned above .",
    "it provides us with the prediction of the a - dependence of @xmath101 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "we observed a decrease of the bond energy with a which is roughly the one predicted by a crude perturbative estimate of the @xmath135 interaction .",
    "this result confirms recent calculations by lanskoy _",
    "et al _ [ 11 ] based on a skyrme - hartree - fock approach , which show a comparable decrease of @xmath3 with a.    we shall end up this section by discussing two effects which could qualitatively affect the present conclusions .",
    "the first one concerns the spin dependence of the @xmath136 potential .",
    "whereas the two @xmath137 are in a singlet state , the actual determination of the @xmath0 coupling constants relies on the @xmath138 spin average . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath135 interaction is somewhat underestimated , the singlet potential being known to be more attractive than the triplet one .    in order to get an idea by how much this effect influences the value of the coupling constants , we compared the singlet and triplet effective yng interactions of yamamoto and bando@xcite .",
    "the ratio of their strengths was then used to determine @xmath139 from the spin average @xmath140 rmf interaction .",
    "we left the vector coupling unchanged and modified the scalar coupling constant .",
    "the resulting @xmath117 relevant for the singlet state increased by 2.8  % and 4.3  % for @xmath119 = 2/3 and 1/3 , respectively .",
    "the second effect is acting in the opposite direction .",
    "namely , the @xmath141 interaction determined from hypernuclei contains implicit correlations , whereas the estimate of the @xmath135 correlation energy should rely on the bare potential .",
    "this last should be determined from the rmf interaction by unfolding with an appropriate @xmath141 correlation function .",
    "to obtain at least a rough estimate of the effect we used the correlation function of pareo et al @xcite and folded the u(r ) interaction entering eq .",
    "the @xmath117 coupling constant ratio appearing in u(r ) is then decreased in order to get exactly the same eigenvalue of eq .",
    "( 14 ) as before .",
    "we determine in this way the bare scalar coupling constant , @xmath142 while @xmath119 is kept unchanged .",
    "this procedure ends in a decrease of @xmath117 by 6.3  % and 1.7  % for @xmath119 = 2/3 and 1/3 , respectively .",
    "these results have been confirmed by a second estimate based on a correlation function constructed from the approach described in @xcite , which leads to even slightly lower values .",
    "adding the two effects we conclude that they tend to cancel each other to a large extent .",
    "consequently the rmf coupling constants might change up to 4  % . the uncertainty in the results of table 4 due to the neglecting of these two effects",
    "are well within the approximations used in the present model .",
    "this paper is devoted to the binding energy of double @xmath0 hypernuclei , more precisely to the bond energy @xmath143 as defined by ( 1 ) .",
    "we show that within the relativistic mean field approach , part of this energy is provided by the short range correlation , the remaining being due to the exchange of @xmath144 and @xmath2 mesons between the two @xmath0s .",
    "the balance between the two effects depends sensitively on the coupling of the @xmath0 to the @xmath14 field .",
    "whereas for a coupling constant @xmath119 = 1/3 the correlation effects are not very efficient , they become sizable at higher values , doubling the rmf results for @xmath119 = 2/3 .",
    "the present results have been obtained by reducing a relativistic two - body equation of the breit type to a schrdinger equation .",
    "furthermore , advantage has been taken of the fact that the average potential experienced by the @xmath0 in a nucleus is very close to an harmonic oscillator potential . in this way",
    "the calculations are considerably simplified .",
    "although more sophisticated calculations are desirable , they are not expected to change the present results , at least at a semi - quatitative level .",
    "we recall that for reasons stated in the introduction our estimate is an upper limit to the @xmath145 correlation energy .",
    "we found that , according to the @xmath146 coupling , at least half of @xmath101 arises from the meson exchanges specific to the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "in such a case one may suspect the argument advocated in the introduction , stating that for ordinary nuclei @xmath24 is essentially due to correlation effects .",
    "actually , it is very easy to get convinced from toy models that the gain in binding energy coming from the short - range two body correlation is dominated by the repulsive @xmath14 field . indeed , assuming @xmath147 @xmath101 gets close to 3.5  mev .",
    "thus , the difference between the @xmath0 and the nucleon case reflects the strength of their coupling to the @xmath14 field .",
    "we remind the reader that the rmf theory can not compete with more elaborated three - body ( cluster ) calculations of @xmath148 . in particular for such a light system as @xmath149",
    ", its application is questionable . in view of extensions to multi-@xmath0 systems",
    ", however , it is important to check the constraints it brings on the coupling of the @xmath0 to the various meson fields . in this respect",
    ", it would be very desirable to obtain experimental data for heavier nuclear cores than those actually available .",
