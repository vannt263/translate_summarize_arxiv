    "the dawn and dusk terminators of hd 189733b represent some of the best - studied atmospheric regions among the known transiting exoplanets , with the spectral coverage ranging from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the mid - infrared ( mir )",
    ". however , there remain discrepancies between spectra measured by the same instruments ( specifically , the planet - star radius ratio as denoted by @xmath2 ) , including : ( i ) disagreement in @xmath3/irac measurements @xcite , thought to be due to different data reduction processes applied to the same transit measurements @xcite ; and ( ii ) disagreement in @xmath4/nicmos observations due to different approaches to transit curve decorrelation @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between different groups stem partly from difficulties in unequivocally correcting for instrumental effects .    at wavelengths shorter than 1 @xmath0 m",
    ", the transmission spectrum decreases monotonically from the uv to the near - infrared ( nir ) , as measured by @xmath4/acs ( 0.551.05 @xmath0 m ) @xcite and @xmath4/stis ( 0.290.57 @xmath0 m ) @xcite .",
    "this sloped spectrum is consistent with the presence of particles in the rayleigh scattering regime and suggests the presence of aerosols in the terminator regions .",
    "@xcite suggested that a thick and vertically extended aerosol layer consisting of silicate grains such as enstatite ( mgsio@xmath1 ) or forsterite ( mg@xmath5sio@xmath6 ) is able to reproduce the rayleigh slope . by applying stellar spot corrections for all available measurements between 0.324 @xmath0 m",
    ", @xcite suggested that the opacity from an optically thick aerosol layer governs the entire transmission spectrum and that the poor quality of the present data can not be used to identify molecular signatures in the terminators .",
    "given this uncertainty in the data , and the degeneracies inherent in their reduction and analysis , the atmospheric properties for the terminators differ from study to study .    in this study",
    "we revisit the atmosphere of the day / night terminators of hd 189733b , considering the transmission spectrum reassessed by @xcite , where the maximum information content from the previous transit data were extracted .",
    "it clearly reveals a precipitous slope in the @xmath71 @xmath0 m spectrum and a flatter spectrum in the ir . in particular",
    ", the spectrum near 1 @xmath0 m is particularly important in determining which opacity source is more plausible in the terminators in the ir , i.e. , optically thick aerosols washing out all other molecular signatures @xcite ; or a combination of aerosols and molecules @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this study is therefore to assess the family of plausible aerosol models that are consistent with the measurements currently available by exploring degeneracies between aerosol and other atmospheric parameters , i.e. , temperature , planetary radius and molecular composition .",
    "we also aim to investigate the influence of different types of aerosols on the transmission spectrum between 0.324 @xmath0 m , demonstrating the importance of measuring a wide spectral range to break the degeneracies between competing atmospheric parameters .",
    "atmospheric properties were derived using the nemesis spectral retrieval tool @xcite , seeking the best - fits across a pre - defined parameterized space of aerosol properties : nadir ( or radial ) optical depth ( @xmath8 ) and particle radius ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the vertical locations and extent of the aerosol layers are poorly characterised with existing measurements , so we choose to define a simple and phenomenological aerosol model following @xcite , where aerosols are uniformly distributed throughout the pressures of the model atmosphere ( 10@xmath1010 bar ) ( uc , the number of particles per cubic centimeter is vertically uniform ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce the number of free parameters during the retrieval process .",
    "more sophisticated aerosol models are commonly used for the study of sub - stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we find that the existing data quality and low signal - to - noise does not warrant the use of more complex aerosol models at this time . in this study , we explore broad ranges for two aerosol parameters , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for various atmospheric conditions so that we are able to characterise the degeneracies between the aerosol properties and other parameters , e.g. , thermal structure , planetary radius , aerosol composition , gaseous compositions .",
    "nemesis finds the best - fitting atmospheric state ( composition and aerosol properties ) that reproduces the observed transit spectrum iteratively , where the next step of retrieval is analytically calculated using the technique of optimal estimation @xcite .",
    "this spectral inversion software was modified to permit analyses of exoplanet spectroscopy and to seek the range of plausible solutions for exoplanetary atmospheres with realistic uncertainties @xcite . to achieve the aerosol information that can be derived from the given data , we grid @xmath8 and @xmath9 over a wide range of values ( see section  [ s22 ] ) .",
    "we consider a range of molecules and atoms ( h@xmath5o , co , co@xmath5 , ch@xmath6 , na and k ) that have signatures in the visible and ir .",

    "hence , we assume that the day / night terminators have the same p - t profile as the dayside atmosphere @xcite .",
    "specifically , we test the robustness of our retrieved composition and aerosol properties by repeating the analysis with the temperatures shifted by @xmath22200  k either side of the best - fitting p - t profile of the dayside hemisphere ( @xmath23 ) ( figure  [ f1 ] ) . the details are discussed in section  [ s321 ] .    in addition to temperature degeneracy , we also consider the planetary radius ( @xmath24 ) at the bottom level of the model atmosphere : @xmath25 .",

    "this shows that the spectrum at wavelengths @xmath338 @xmath0 m contains a large amount of information about the aerosols as seen at wavelengths @xmath71 @xmath0 m .",

    "the dependence of @xmath38 on the fitting quality and aerosol properties will be discussed in section  [ s322 ] .     as a function of wavelength .",
    "an increase in @xmath38 at 1 @xmath0 m due to an increase in @xmath9 is more sensitive than an increase at 10 @xmath0 m . given the same @xmath8 at 1 @xmath0 m , the smaller @xmath9 is , the greater @xmath8 is expected at wavelengths longer than 8 @xmath0 m , where an upturn in @xmath38 is shown . ]    an aerosol layer composed of small particles ( @xmath54 1 ) produces a negligible opacity between 18 @xmath0 m , where molecules , primarily h@xmath5o , are able to account for the @xmath4/nicmos and @xmath3/irac spectrum .",
    "this implies that any conclusions for aerosols made in this study are unaffected by the diverse interpretations of the @xmath4/nicmos data by different studies @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the large errors on measurements in the 18 @xmath0 m region permit solutions where the flat spectrum could be produced by a thick aerosol layer with large particles ( @xmath551 ) , for which @xmath38 is nearly flat across wavelengths . in this sense",
    ", @xcite suggested that the whole transmission spectrum could be reproduced if small grains at high altitude are responsible for the spectrum at wavelengths @xmath71 @xmath0 m , and deeper , larger grains ( @xmath52 1@xmath0 m ) underlying the lower aerosol height forming the flat spectrum across the ir .",
    "although more complex solutions with multiple particle sizes may be considered , such complexity is not required to fit the data .    for the best - fit scenario for the full spectral range ,",
    "we infer @xmath56 0.1 @xmath0 m and @xmath57 0.004 .",
    "molecular abundances in the terminator regions are comparable with theoretical predictions of chemistry ",
    "the h@xmath5o and co abundances ( @xmath5810@xmath59 ) are consistent across the globe ( @xmath60 for both hemispheres ) , and a high co@xmath5 abundance and a low ch@xmath6 abundance ( @xmath6110@xmath62 ) are found compared to a disequilibrium chemistry model ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a low c / o ratio compared to the dayside atmosphere , which is close to the solar value of about 0.50.6 @xcite . however , the best - fitting solutions for molecules listed here have a broad uncertainty due to degeneracies with temperature , planetary radius , and aerosol composition .",
    "therefore , uncertainties in these best - fitting values will be assessed in subsequent sections .                        during retrieval , temperature and planetary radius change opacity , which defines the absorption feature at each wavelength .",
    "given the fundamental degeneracy between how these parameters affect the spectrum , however , the retrieval of these parameters is not independently constrainable @xcite . as a result , a change in opacity due to temperature and planetary radius alters the aerosol properties significantly . in this section , we will therefore investigate how the effects of these degeneracy sources change the aerosol solution .",
    "firstly , to test the sensitivity of the aerosol properties to temperature , we repeat the aerosol retrieval analysis for colder and warmer thermal structures , i.e. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , for which the temperature of the entire profile is shifted by 200k from the dayside temperature profile ( @xmath17 ) as introduced in section  [ s22 ] . the planetary radius is fixed to @xmath26 .",
    "setting up the same retrieval parameters listed in section  [ s22 ] , suites of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 are explored . in figure",
    "[ f4 ] , it is shown that the colder temperature profile increases @xmath8 compared to the @xmath17 case whereas the warmer temperature shows a thinner @xmath8 than the @xmath17 case .",
    "this is because warmer temperature ( 1 ) increases the atmospheric scale height and ( 2 ) enhances the continuum absorption from the h@xmath5he cia and rayleigh scattering across wavelengths ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "an enhanced continuum absorption by @xmath66 , in turn , results in reduced molecular abundances ( particularly h@xmath5o ) compared to the @xmath23 case that is necessary to fit the @xmath4/nicmos and @xmath3/irac fluxes .",
    "however , this yields a poor fit to the @xmath4/acs channels in the 0.81.1 @xmath0 m ( spectrum in red color in figure  [ f6 ] ) , resulting in the best fitting quality for @xmath67 worsened over @xmath23 .    for @xmath68 ,",
    "the continuum absorption by h@xmath5 and he is reduced and the molecular abundances are enhanced to fit the measurements in the ir . since @xmath68 causes the scale height of atmosphere to be reduced , which reduces the scale of the spectral features , the best - fit spectrum for @xmath68 ( spectrum in orange color in figure  [ f6 ] ) at @xmath71 @xmath0 m reproduces the @xmath4/acs measurements ( 0.61.0 @xmath0 m ) with a spectrum that starts to rise at 0.9 @xmath0 m towards shorter wavelengths , which gives an improved fitting quality .",
    "regardless of temperature degeneracy , we find that the upper limit of @xmath9 is consistent , irrespective of the chosen temperature profile .",
    "this is because the particle size determines the shape of @xmath38 across all wavelengths , which is responsible for the slope at @xmath71 @xmath0 m and an absorption at @xmath338 @xmath0 m ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "independence of the maximum particle size with respect to temperature tells us that the degeneracy between the two parameters can be broken from the current measurements .",
    "secondly , we fix the temperature profile to be @xmath23 and repeat the grid of retrievals for different @xmath8 and @xmath9 , this time shifting the planetary radius by 0.5 per cent from @xmath15 .",
    "as we discussed in the analysis of temperature sensitivity , it is found that the upper limit of @xmath9 is still well - constrained even though the radius of the planet varies ( figure  [ f5 ] ) .",
    "again , the degeneracy between the largest particle size allowed and planetary radius is broken . for a smaller @xmath69",
    ", the optical thicknesses can be larger than the @xmath26 case that is required to fit the slope in the uv and visible .",
    "it is found that the well - fitted solutions also appear at large @xmath8 ( @xmath480.04 ) and small @xmath9 ( @xmath70.01 @xmath0 m ) , the region where a high extinction by aerosols is shown beyond 8 @xmath0 m ( c.f .",
    "spectrum in cyan color in figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "we see that an increase in the radius by 0.5 per cent from @xmath15 mimics the effect of an increase in the temperature by 200  k because the main effect from the temperature is an increase in the scale height .",
    "a large @xmath24 favors a reduced aerosol @xmath8 at @xmath71 @xmath0 m to find a solution for the @xmath4/stis and acs data .",
    "in the ir , the continuum absorption by cia reaches as high as the radius ratio at the bottom of the measured spectra and therefore a small amount of h@xmath5o is required to fit the @xmath4/nicmos spectrum .",
    "this leads to the shallower best - fit spectrum at wavelengths @xmath331 @xmath0 m than the best - fit spectrum for the @xmath67 , @xmath26 case ( see spectra in red and cyan color in figure  [ f6 ] ) , even though the @xmath49n contours are nearly identical .",
    "we conclude that constraining the molecular abundance in the terminators with a narrow range of uncertainty is not achievable from the current measurements because the extinction by aerosols is highly degenerate with temperature and planetary radius .",
    "we note here that if the scale height of the model atmosphere is reduced due to a high mean molecular weight found from the retrieval , the model top - of - atmosphere pressure required to reproduce the @xmath4/stis spectrum would be lower than 10@xmath10 bar , as the physical extent of the atmosphere is reduced by increasing the mean molecular weight , leading to a poor fit to the entire spectrum .",
    "we tested the effect on our results of reducing the model top - of - atmosphere pressure to 10@xmath70 bar ; we found that , in general , the required total cloud optical depth was reduced by a factor of two in this case , whereas the upper limit on the particle size is unchanged .",
    "this implies that although the aerosol solutions are degenerate with the top pressure level , reproducing the slope at wavelengths @xmath71 @xmath0 m is much more weighted by the particle size as it primarily governs the shape of the spectrum in this wavelength region .          , mg@xmath5sio@xmath6 @xcite , astronomical silicate @xcite , na@xmath5s @xcite and tholin @xcite .",

    "an increased @xmath8 induces a peak in the spectrum at 10 @xmath0 m due to aerosol extinction that produces no significant change in fitting quality because there are no constraints in this wavelength region .",
    "the test implies that spectroscopic measurements at @xmath33 8@xmath0 m contain valuable information to understand the composition of aerosol in a hot jupiter atmosphere .    on the other hand , we find that the extinction efficiency of na@xmath5s becomes flat at wavelengths @xmath331 @xmath0 m due to the flat real refractive index and the small imaginary refractive index , whereas a high imaginary index is apparent at wavelengths @xmath70.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "this means that , except for the region at wavelengths @xmath70.6 @xmath0 m , the best - fit spectrum with na@xmath5s aerosols ( spectrum in red in figure  [ f7 ] ) resembles that with the mgsio@xmath1 in all ir regions , where an extinction by mgsio@xmath1 is hardly shown . as a result , only the @xmath4/stis and acs measurements are useful to characterise the properties of the na@xmath5s aerosols , which adds more uncertainty to @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see the bottom right panel in figure  [ f8 ] ) .",
    "this implies that constraining aerosols in an atmosphere is highly dependent on the extinction efficiency of materials and that the properties of aerosols can only really be constrained in wavelength regions where strong extinction features are evident .",
    "a similar interpretation can be also made in the case of the tholin aerosol , which yields @xmath8 that is thinner than 0.01 in the best - fit case ( see the bottom - right panel in figure  [ f8 ] ) .",
    "the shape of the @xmath47/n contour that is different compared to other candidates also comes from the difference in @xmath38 . for a small particle ( @xmath530.1 @xmath0 m ) ,",
    "the tholin s extinction coefficients at wavelengths shorter than 1 @xmath0 m decrease more rapidly with wavelength than the other materials as the bottom panel of figure  [ f9 ] shows , which induces a high absorption at @xmath71@xmath0 m , producing good fits to the spectrum even for small @xmath8 ( @xmath70.001 ) at 1 @xmath0 m . for a large particle ( @xmath520.1 @xmath0 m ) , tholin becomes also optically active at wavelengths longward of 2 @xmath0 m , where the spectra fitted exhibit large absorption features that provide a large deviation from the ir measurements , if @xmath720.01 .",
    "therefore , we find that the tholin @xmath8 must be very small to reproduce the spectrum , which is constrained by the measurements in between 0.324 @xmath0 m except @xmath4/nicmos .",
    "overall , we found that all of the aerosol materials considered in the present study are capable of fitting the transmission spectrum of hd 189733b .",
    "the properties of each aerosol constrained are highly diverse , mainly due to the unique characteristics of @xmath38 and the divergence of the aerosol properties comes from the uncertainty in condensation state in the terminators .",
    "we found that the retrieval of @xmath8 depends on the choice of material , which adds more uncertainty to the retrieval value . despite the large uncertainty of @xmath8 retrieved , the conclusion on the upper limit of @xmath9 ( @xmath480.1 @xmath0 m ) is still robust , regardless of the kind of aerosol material .",
    "this is because of the appearance of a peak ( the first harmonic ) of @xmath38 at short wavelengths if @xmath73 0.1 @xmath0 m , which results in poor fits at the @xmath4/stis bandpasses .",
    "temperature and other atmospheric parameters such as planetary radius , aerosol properties are highly correlated with gaseous molecules , which are the most significant degeneracy sources in the exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "previously , inverse model studies have shown that the atmospheric molecular abundance in the transiting exoplanets can not be constrained uniquely from existing transit spectra and therefore the degeneracy between molecules and aerosols , temperature , planetary radius introduces an uncertainty to the atmospheric retrieval method @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the parameters defining the aerosol deck pressures and its vertical structure of compositional amount modify the molecular abundances , and the uncertain composition of the aerosols increase the uncertainty on the gaseous composition in the retrievals .",
    "furthermore , the choice of value of the planetary radius adds more uncertainty to the determination of molecular abundances .",
    "the vertical sensitivity of the spectrum to variations in molecular composition , temperature and aerosol opacity is shown in figure  [ f10 ] . ] .",
    "it is found that the effect of na and k are predominant in the uv and visible range , but also influences the near ir and they play a crucial role in fitting the data points at @xmath71 @xmath0 m . on the other hand ,",
    "our mgsio@xmath1 aerosol model provides strong sensitivities at short ( @xmath71 @xmath0 m ) and long ( @xmath338 @xmath0 m ) wavelengths due to a low extinction of rayleigh slope in the middle range , which is broadly relevant for all other materials tested in the present study .",
    "this tells us that the aerosol properties are weakly correlated with the molecules that are spectrally active between 18 @xmath0 m . in table",
    "[ t1 ] , we present the ranges of molecular abundances constrained with different aerosol materials .",
    "we find that the range of the abundance of h@xmath5o for @xmath47/n@xmath72 are well constrained with a low uncertainty and this tendency is consistent for all aerosol materials , confirming that there are marginal degeneracies between h@xmath5o and aerosol .",
    "however , this is only true where the aerosols have negligible influence in the 18 @xmath0 m range .",
    "if the extinction spectrum of aerosols is rather different and there are absorption features in this wavelength range , there would be more uncertainty in the h@xmath5o abundance .",
    "a possible interpretation of the narrow range of the h@xmath5o abundance is that there are only 8 data points in the ir available and they provide strong constraints that determine the molecular abundance .    for all scenarios that we considered in table  [ t1 ] ,",
    "we note that the abundances of co , co@xmath5 , and ch@xmath6 have a small range compared to other gaseous molecules .",
    "this is because , for any initial atmospheric conditions that are different from the best fit scenario , modifying the abundance of h@xmath5o resolves most discrepancies between the measured and fitted spectra in the ir , requiring nearly the same amount of carbon chemicals to fit the data whose opacity contribution to the total spectrum is negligible , i.e. , an insignificant contribution to @xmath74 .",
    "we note that retrievals without carbon chemicals marginally change the @xmath74/n contours in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 space and the best - fit fitting quality , e.g. , @xmath74/n=2.42 to 2.55 for the case of mgsio@xmath1 , @xmath23 , and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the existence of co , co@xmath5 , ch@xmath6 is highly uncertain . particularly , the spectral sensitivities to the carbon - bearing molecules are correlated with the signatures of h@xmath5o , such that the transmission spectrum is unable to place strong constraints on the presence of co , co@xmath5 and ch@xmath6 due to the degeneracy between them . even when the temperature profile is fixed to",
    "that derived from the dayside emission spectrum , some of these degeneracies still remain .",
    "o , co@xmath75 , co , ch@xmath76 , na and k , plotted against pressure and wavelength .",
    "these calculations use the result of the spectrum with the best - fit case in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "the contours are normalised to the maximum values in each panel . ]",
    "conversely , the range of alkali abundances from retrievals as presented in table  [ t1 ] appears rather large ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath49n@xmath72 ) .",
    "according to figure  [ f10 ] , the sensitivities of the spectrum to na and k in the visible and nir overlap with that of the aerosols .",
    "their abundances are sensitive to both optical depth and particle size of aerosol , resulting in broad uncertainties in their amounts .",
    "this clearly shows a significant degeneracy between alkalis and aerosol  the extinction efficiency of aerosols for any particle sizes smaller than @xmath480.1 @xmath0 m produces a rayleigh slope at @xmath71.2 @xmath0 m , where the total optical depth of the atmosphere is the sum of an aerosol @xmath8 ( @xmath79 due to rayleigh scattering ) and optical depth by alkalis .",
    "therefore , a small change in aerosol properties ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) leads to a larger change in @xmath80 to fit the slope .",
    "this was suggested theoretically for cloudy exoplanets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is shown in the analysis of the reflection spectrum of this planet @xcite . despite this degeneracy , an additional retrieval test where na and k were excluded produces a radius ratio slope at @xmath71.2 @xmath0 m with @xmath49n@xmath335 , compared to the best fit case in section  [ s31 ] , for all combinations of aerosol @xmath8 and @xmath9 and h@xmath5o ( not shown ) .",
    "this test adds more credibility to the presence of na and k to reproduce the transmission spectrum @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f10 ] informs us that the spectrum is insensitive to temperature shortward of 1 @xmath0 m , where a high sensitivity to the presence of aerosols is shown due to the predominance of rayleigh scattering .",
    "longward of 1 @xmath0 m , the spectrum is sensitive to both temperature and h@xmath5o abundance , confirming that an independent retrieval of temperature is not achievable from the primary transits @xcite .",
    "the molecular degeneracy with temperature therefore increases the uncertainty on the chemistry in the atmosphere because temperature is one of the primary driving forces that determine the opacity of the molecules and therefore the shape of the transmission spectrum .",
    "given @xmath71 , the derived abundance of h@xmath5o with @xmath23 for @xmath49n@xmath72 , @xmath8110@xmath59 is an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath68 , @xmath8210@xmath59 and larger than @xmath67 , @xmath8310@xmath59 .",
    "similarly , given @xmath23 , the range of the h@xmath5o abundance with @xmath69 , @xmath84 are two and four orders of magnitude enhanced compared to the cases with @xmath26 , @xmath8510@xmath59 and @xmath86 , @xmath8710@xmath59 , thus limiting our ability to determine the abundance of h@xmath5o in the terminators within a narrow uncertainty range ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "it is expected that this uncertainty will become broader when we add the ambiguity of the aerosol material to the error budget .    in summary",
    ", the spectrum shows a low sensitivity to gaseous constituents ( except h@xmath5o ) and characterising their abundances is challenging because of ( i ) a high correlation with aerosol ( na and k ) or ( ii ) the uncertainty in their presence in the atmosphere ( carbon molecules ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that we are unable to robustly determine abundances for gaseous constituents from the spectroscopic measurements used in this study , due to a considerable degeneracy between multiple molecules contained in the model atmosphere and other parameters that determine the shape of spectrum .

    "exploring a suite of aerosol models for a wide wavelength region , we demonstrated that there are considerable correlations between aerosol parameters and temperature , planetary radius , aerosol composition and even gaseous alkali abundances that are not easily broken  if the temperature or planetary radius increases , the opacity required from the aerosols to fit the transit spectrum decreases . at the same time , na and k compete to fit the data in the visible and nir .",
    "moreover , we showed that different materials for the aerosol affect the best - fit @xmath8 and @xmath9 because they have different extinction efficiencies ( @xmath38 ) . due to the wide variety of processes that could cause aerosols in a hot jupiter atmosphere ,",
