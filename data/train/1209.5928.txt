    "luminosities is that these objects are clustered , involving a non - negligible chance of photon pollution from line - of - sight objects .",
    "we have found a new wnh star vfts682 in 30dor ( evans et al .",
    "2011 ; bestenlehner et al .",
    "it is a near - identical twin of one of the crowther stars , r136a3 .",
    "surprisingly , vfts682 is in apparent isolation from the r136 cluster ( see bestenlehner et al . for a discussion on isolated formation or a `` slow runaway '' status ) .",
    "this enables a check on the reliability of the luminosities derived for the core stars .",
    "our finding of log@xmath6 for vfts682 provides support for high luminosities and masses , as the chance of line - of - sight pollution is small for this isolated star .",

    "the approach we use to compute @xmath2 for vms is similar to the monte carlo method used to predict @xmath2 for normal ob stars ( vink et al .",
    "2000 ) . until 2008",
    "our methodology was semi - empirical , as we assumed a velocity law that reached a certain empirical @xmath1 .",
    "mller & vink ( 2008 ) suggested a new line - force parametrization that explicitly depends on radius ( rather than the velocity gradient , as in cak theory ) .",
    "we predicted @xmath1 within @xmath1025% of the observations . in muijres",
    "et al . ( 2012 ) we tested the mller & vink approach by comparison to hydrodynamical models . as both methods gave similar results , we use the mller & vink approach for vms .",
    "nugis & lamers ( 2002 ) and grfener & hamann ( 2008 ) studied radiative driving due to fe - peak opacities in deep photospheric layers of wolf - rayet ( wr ) winds .",
    "as @xmath3 crosses unity in deep layers , the sonic point is located at high optical depth , leading to the initiation of optically - thick winds . in the monte",
    "carlo models , one traces the driving over the entire wind , and as the bulk of the energy is transferred in the supersonic portion of the wind , one is less susceptible to the details of the photospheric region .",

    "divided by @xmath11 .",
    "symbols correspond to models of different mass ranges ( vink et al .",
    "in figure[f_mdotvink ] we show mass - loss predictions for vms as a function of the eddington parameter @xmath3 ( see vink et al .",

    "most notable is the presence of a _",
    "kink _ in the relation . for o - type stars with `` low '' @xmath3 and optically - thin winds ,",
    "the @xmath2 @xmath14 @xmath15 relationship is shallow , with @xmath16 @xmath172 .",
    "there is a steepening at higher @xmath3 , where @xmath16 becomes @xmath175 . here",
    "the objects show optically thick wr - like winds , with optical depths and wind efficiencies above unity .",
    "grfener et al .",
    "( 2011 ) recently provided empirical evidence for our predicted steep exponent ( @xmath16 @xmath175 ) , but note that there are still issues with our @xmath1 values for the high @xmath3 range .",
    "for now we employ the vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) mass - loss recipe for our assessment of the fate of the most massive stars .",
    "these mass - loss rates agree extremely well with the rates discussed by crowther et al .",

    "this leads to a total main - sequence mass lost of @xmath17150@xmath0 .",
    "additional mass loss during the core helium wr phase should further``evaporate '' the object .",
    "our results indicate that there is little room for substantial additional mass loss in luminous blue variable ( lbv ) eruptions .",
    "our results also imply that imbhs and pair - instability explosions are unlikely . unless we go to lower @xmath4 environments .",
    "the issue of mass loss and evolution at low @xmath4 has gained attention due to the issue of the progenitors of long grbs . within woosley s collapsar model ,",
    "grb progenitors require two key properties : ( i ) a rapidly rotating core , and ( ii ) the absence of a hydrogen envelope .",
    "therefore , grb progenitors are thought to be rotating wr stars .",
    "the potential problem with this is that wr star have high mass loss which should remove the angular momentum before the core collapses .    in the rapidly rotating stellar models of yoon & langer ( 2005 ) ,",
    "the objects evolve `` quasi - homogeneously '' .",
    "the stars are subject to a strong magnetic coupling between the core and envelope .",
    "if the rapid rotation can be maintained due to low main - sequence mass loss in low @xmath4 galaxies , the objects may avoid slow - down in a red supergiant ( rsg ) or lbv phase , and directly become rapidly rotating wr stars .",
    "if the wr winds also depend on fe driving ( vink & de koter 2005 ) , the wr stars can maintain rapid rotation towards the very end , making grbs ",
    "but _ only _ at low @xmath4 .",
    "grb data presented at this meeting suggest that grbs are not restricted to low @xmath4 , but there seems to be a need for a grb channel at high @xmath4 .",
    "we have recently identified a sub - group of rotating galactic wr stars  allowing for a potential solution to this problem ( vink et al .",
    "2011b ; grfener et al .",
    "spectropolarimetry surveys show that the majority of wr stars have spherically symmetric winds indicative of slow rotation , but a small minority display signatures of a spinning stellar surface .",
    "we found this spinning sub - group to be surrounded by ejecta nebulae , which are thought to be ejected during a recent rsg / lbv phase , which suggests that these wr stars are still young and rotating .",
    "if the core - surface coupling were strong enough , the cores would not be expected to rotate rapidly enough to make a grb , but if the core - envelope coupling is less efficient , they may have the required angular momentum in their cores to make grbs . in most high @xmath4 cases these stars",
    "would nonetheless still be expected to spin down due to mass loss , but within our post - rsg / lbv scenario one would not exclude the possibility of a high @xmath4 grb . yet",
    ", low @xmath4 environments are still preferred due to weaker wr winds .",
    "helium model of grfener et al .",
    "( 2012a ) showing a density inversion .",
    "this leads to an inflation of the outer envelope.,width=326 ]    the stellar winds of o supergiants are fast ( @xmath172000 - 4000 km / s ) and transparent , whilst those emanating from lower @xmath5 b supergiants are much slower ( @xmath17100 - 1000 km / s ) .",
    "this is because o star winds are driven by high fe ionization states , whilst those of b and later sub - types are driven by lower ones .",
    "this is wind bi - stability ( bs ) .",
    "lbvs increase their radii continuously on timescales of @xmath1010 yrs . these sdor excursion across the hr diagram lead to winds with variable @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if the lbv wind changes instantaneously at the bs - jump , we can explain the double - throughed h@xmath22 absorptions seen in lbv spectra ( groh & vink 2011 ) .",
    "intriguingly such double - throughed h@xmath22 line profiles have also been seen in the luminous iin sn 2005gj , which was for this reason suggested to have an lbv progenitor ( trundle et al .",
    "the same bs jump was also used to first suggest the lbv - sne ii link ( kotak & vink 2006 ) .",
    "even if @xmath2 varies as a result of lbv radius changes , we still do not understand _ why _ lbvs change their radii ( see vink 2009 for a recent review ) .",
    "one possibility would be that the sub - photospheric outer envelopes of the stars become `` inflated '' as a result of the proximity to the eddington limit ( see fig.[f_densinv ] ) .",
    "ishii et al . ( 1999 ) first studied the outer envelope inflation from stellar evolution models , and in grfener et al .",
    "( 2012a ) we developped an analytic explanation for how such an envelope inflation would occur .",
    "we described the radial inflation as a function of a dimensionless parameter w , which largely depends on the topology of the fe - opacity peak . for @xmath23",
    ", we discovered an instability limit for which the stellar envelope becomes unbound . within our framework , we are in principle able to explain lbv sdor variations .",
    "stellar temperatures could be strongly affected , and there could be important implications of the _ radii _ of progenitor wrs and lbvs prior to collapse , as sn with different sub - types ii , sn ibc , and grbs ."
