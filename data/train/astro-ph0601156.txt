    "relativistic blast waves from grbs are believed to produce the observed afterglow emission of the bursts .",
    "the blast - wave structure is schematically shown in figure  1 . to a reasonably good approximation",
    ", the whole blast [ the region between fs and rs , including the contact discontinuity ( cd ) ] may be assumed to have a common lorentz factor @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the lorentz factors of the forward shock ( fs ) and reverse shock ( rs ) are denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "pressures @xmath0 and @xmath1 behind the forward and reverse shocks are calculated from the jump conditions .",
    "we focus here on the early stages of the grb explosion when both forward and reverse shocks are expected to produce significant emission .",
    "our calculations assume spherical symmetry .",
    "however , the results also apply to beamed explosions at early stages , when @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the opening angle of the ejecta .",
    "the reverse shock ( rs ) is expected to propagate in the ejecta and produce significant emission at radii @xmath8  cm .",
    "the rs emission depends on the structure of the ejecta that forms at smaller radii @xmath9  cm , when internal shocks take place @xcite .",
    "@xmath10    theoretically , one expects the ejecta to emerge with a monotonic velocity profile ( internal shocks tend to make the profile monotonic ) .",
    "therefore we study here radially stratified ejecta and calculate the emission expected from such `` stratified fireballs . ''",
    "a simple example model considered here assumes ejecta with radial profile of lorentz factor @xmath11 shown in figure 2 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15  s is the burst duration ) . here",
    "@xmath16 is the lagrangian coordinate that labels the shells in the ejecta by their ejection times .",
    "the luminosity of the ejecta @xmath17 is also shown in figure 2 .",
    "specifically , @xmath18)$ ] is assumed here with @xmath19  erg / s and @xmath20  s for the timescale of decay .",
    "the total energy of the burst is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the customary approximate model blast wave assumes equal pressures at the forward and reverse shocks : @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this assumption , as we show in an accompanying paper , enables a simple analytical solution for @xmath3 and pressure @xmath23 :      it turns out however that the assumption of equal pressure leads to a contradiction with the law of energy conservation .",
    "the total energy of the blast wave and ejecta at a time @xmath26 may be found by integrating the @xmath27 component of the stress - energy tensor over volume , @xmath28 .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 .",
    "@xmath29 decreases with time ( dashed curve in the left panel ) , i.e. the energy is not conserved .",
    "we therefore propose another dynamical description .      instead of finding @xmath3 from @xmath2",
    "we solve the differential equation for @xmath3 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the integrated enthalpy of the blast .",
    "the first term on the right describes the external force applied to the blast due to the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the second term describes the adiabatic acceleration of the blast .",
    "this equation is derived from the exact relativistic fluid equation .",
    "it is obtained by integrating over the blast and may be viewed as a mechanical equation .",
    "the mechanical model is consistent with the energy and momentum conservation ( solid curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "3 ) .",
    "we calculate the afterglow emission using the standard simple model of the postshock plasma .",
    "it assumes that a fraction @xmath33 of the shock energy goes to the electrons and accelerates them with a power - law energy spectrum @xmath34 .",
    "the postshock magnetic field is parameterized by the `` equipartition '' parameter @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thermal energy density of the shocked medium .",
    "we discretize the external medium and the ejecta into spherical mass shells @xmath37 and use the lagrangian description of the blast wave .",
    "each @xmath37 is impulsively heated at some point by a shock front ( forward or reverse ) .",
    "we track the subsequent evolution of the shell and calculate its synchrotron emission in the shell comoving frame .",
    "the shock - heated shell suffers radiative and adiabatic energy losses in the expanding blast wave , and its magnetic field decreases , so the shell emission weakens with time .",
    "we find its contribution to observed radiation at a given observed time @xmath38 .",
    "integration over all @xmath37 gives the exact total spectrum received from the blast wave at a given @xmath38 .",
    "the optical and infrared light curves for two example models ( stratified and non - stratified ) are shown in figure 4 .",
    "we find weak optical emission from the reverse shock .",
    "it is weak because the rs lorentz factor relative to the blast , @xmath40 , is modest and the emitted spectrum peaks in ir rather than in optical band .",
    "the peak frequency is @xmath41 the evolution of @xmath40 is shown in figure  3 ( right panel ) ; its typical value is @xmath42 and the factor @xmath43 that enters @xmath44 is small , @xmath45 , shifting the peak frequency to ir .",
    "the behavior of the rs lorentz factor @xmath40 in the stratified fireball is significantly different from the non - stratified case : it reached maximum and then minimum ( fig .",
    "3 ) . therefore",
    ", the rs emission in the stratified fireball is weaker and its peak in the light curve is less pronounced , with a smoother rise and slower decay ."
