    "recently there has been considerable interest in the study of thermodynamic quantities of a system in the presence of a finite coupling to the heat bath @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the classical equilibrium state , the stationary quantum state depends on the system - bath coupling and thus the low - temperature regime is of particular interest . even on a conceptual level , for finite system - bath coupling , the correct definition of basic thermodynamic quantities like the specific heat has proven to be far from obvious @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of a free particle coupled to a heat bath is particularly rich . in the absence of an environment",
    ", the free particle behaves classically for any nonvanishing temperature .",
    "this unusual behavior is a consequence of the lack of any energy scale besides the thermal energy @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the temperature and @xmath2 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the situation changes once the particle is confined to a finite region in space of length @xmath3 or coupled to an environment . in the first case",
    ", an energy scale @xmath4 appears where @xmath5 is the mass of the particle , while in the latter case , the relaxation frequency @xmath6 due to the coupling to the environment yields an energy scale @xmath7 .",
    "it is the second scenario which one is interested in when studying the effect of a finite coupling to the heat bath .",
    "then all thermodynamic quantities will depend on the dimensionless temperature @xmath8 . as a first example of the intricacy associated with the limit of vanishing damping , @xmath9 , in such a situation",
    ", we mention the diffusion of a free brownian particle . the long - time behavior is governed by the diffusion constant @xmath10 . for any nonvanishing value of @xmath6 ,",
    "one finds diffusive motion while for @xmath11 , the motion will be ballistic .",
    "the limit @xmath9 will thus be qualitatively different from @xmath11 .",
    "the peculiar combination @xmath8 implies that for any nonzero temperature , the free particle will be driven into the classical regime when @xmath6 approaches zero . on the other hand , for any nonzero value of @xmath6",
    ", there exists a low - temperature region which is essentially quantum in nature and depends on the coupling to the heat bath @xcite . in this regime , the specific heat approaches zero as temperature goes to zero while the specific heat of an isolated free particle remains at its classical value @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , for appropriately chosen coupling between the free particle and the heat bath , the entropy exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of temperature .",
    "evaluation of the specific heat according to standard thermodynamic relations results in negative values .",
    "however , as entropy and specific heat pertain only to a subsystem formed by the free particle , this is not in contradiction to basic thermodynamic stability criteria @xcite .",
    "while the free particle might appear to be rather special , we will argue in the present paper that the scenario just discussed also applies in the context of the casimir effect ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there , in the simplest case , one considers the force between two parallel plane mirrors separated by a distance @xmath3 due to the boundary conditions imposed by the mirrors on the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the electrons in the mirrors and the electromagnetic field therefore is essential , in particular if real mirrors are considered . on the one hand",
    ", the reflectivity of metals goes to zero for high frequencies on a scale determined by the plasma frequency @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as normal metals are considered , the dc conductivity @xmath14 is finite . within the drude model this finite conductivity unavoidably comes with a relaxation frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the conductivity of metals like gold employed in measurements of the casimir force is so large that the relaxation frequency @xmath6 is much smaller than the plasma frequency @xmath13 and smaller than the frequency @xmath15 associated with mirror separations between 20 nm and @xmath16 used in experiments so far @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , at room temperature the energy scales @xmath17 and @xmath7 are comparable , thus opening the opportunity to explore the transition from the classical to the quantum regime .",
    "as we will show in this paper , if apart from the thermal scale the relaxation frequency @xmath6 represents the smallest frequency scale , essential low - temperature features of the casimir effect within the drude model are analogous to those pointed out above for the free brownian particle . in our opinion",
    ", this analogy will be valuable for the understanding of the thermal casimir effect and shed additional light on thermodynamic peculiarities related to the transverse electric mode @xcite like the negative entropy found for the drude model .",

    ", the particle will be confined to a region of size @xmath3 which is assumed to be sufficiently large so that the energy quantization is irrelevant for the temperatures of interest , _ i.e. _  @xmath18 . even for microscopic systems like a hydrogen atom and the lowest temperatures attainable today , choosing @xmath19 would easily meet this condition .",
    "the free particle is assumed to be bilinearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the total hamiltonian can then be cast into the form @xmath20 with the system hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the momentum of the particle , the bath hamiltonian describing an infinite collection of harmonic oscillators of masses @xmath23 and frequencies @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the hamiltonian @xmath26 coupling the free particle and the bath oscillators via their respective positions @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for a more detailed discussion of this hamiltonian",
    ", we refer the reader to the literature @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the second term appearing in ( [ eq : hsb ] ) is crucial to ensure the translational invariance of the free brownian particle .",
    "furthermore , the bath parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are sufficient to model any linear heat bath @xcite .    as a starting point for the following thermodynamic considerations , we introduce the reduced partition function @xcite @xmath29}{\\text{tr}_b[\\exp(-\\beta h_b]}\\,.\\ ] ] in the absence of any coupling between system and bath",
    ", this quantity reduces to the partition function of the system while otherwise it accounts for the influence of the coupling . any quantity which can be obtained by a linear operation from the logarithm of this partition function",
    "can be viewed as a difference of the quantities related to the system and bath on one hand and to the bath alone on the other hand @xcite .",
    "it thus describes the effect induced by coupling a system degree of freedom to the heat bath .",
    "such quantities therefore do not need to satisfy thermodynamic conditions which have to be imposed on closed systems .    for a free brownian particle , the reduced partition function defined in ( [ eq : partfunc ] )",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath30 here , @xmath31 are the matsubara frequencies and @xmath32 is the laplace transform of the damping kernel which for ohmic damping is simply given by a constant , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath33 . in order to ensure the convergence of the infinite product , a high - frequency cutoff has to be introduced which",
    "is often chosen to be of the form @xcite @xmath34 in the internal energy and therefore also the free energy , a finite cutoff @xmath35 is needed while the limit of infinite cutoff can be taken for the entropy , for example . as we will see at the end of this section , it may however be interesting to keep @xmath35 finite and even to consider the case of very small cutoff frequencies .",
    "based on ( [ eq : partfuncfree ] ) , we define an entropy @xmath36 by means of the standard thermodynamic relation @xmath37\\,.\\ ] ] we will carry out the discussion of the entropy in two steps which both lead to results of relevance for our later considerations of the casimir effect .",
    "first , we will restrict ourselves to the limit of infinite cutoff frequency @xmath35 and then , in a second step , we admit finite cutoff frequencies .    from ( [ eq : s_def ] ) one finds with ( [ eq : partfuncfree ] ) and ( [ eq : drudekernel ] ) in the limit of @xmath38 the entropy @xmath39-\\frac{\\hbar\\beta\\gamma}{2\\pi}\\psi\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\beta\\gamma}{2\\pi}\\right)\\\\ & \\quad-\\frac{1}{2}\\log(\\hbar\\beta\\gamma)+\\frac{\\hbar\\beta\\gamma}{2\\pi}-\\frac{1}{2}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the gamma function and @xmath41 its logarithmic derivative . in the zero - temperature limit , the entropy takes the value @xmath42\\ ] ] which depends logarithmically on the box size @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of this non - vanishing entropy @xmath43 is a consequence of the fact that we do not account for the level spacing due to the finite box size as discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "we rather are interested in the influence of a finite damping strength . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on the difference @xmath44 which is independent of @xmath3 .    for high temperatures ,",
    "one finds from ( [ eq : s_fp ] ) @xmath45\\,.\\ ] ] in view of the entropy constant ( [ eq : s0 ] ) it follows that the high - temperature behavior of the entropy @xmath36 does not depend on the damping strength @xmath6 .",
    "this reflects the fact that equilibrium properties in classical thermodynamics do not depend on the strength of the coupling between system and heat bath . at the same time , the high - temperature expression for the entropy represents the entropy of an undamped free particle for arbitrary temperatures @xmath46 . by means of the relation @xmath47 between specific heat @xmath48 and entropy @xmath36 , the logarithmic dependence of the entropy on the inverse temperature leads to a constant specific heat @xmath49 for any nonvanishing temperature in the absence of damping .    in the presence of damping ,",
    "quantum effects arise in the low - temperature regime where ( [ eq : s_fp ] ) yields @xmath50 this expression diverges for vanishing damping constant , clearly indicating that the limit @xmath9 is nontrivial at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the constant specific heat found for the undamped particle , the specific heat now depends linearly on temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the difference between the entropy ( [ eq : s_fp ] ) and its zero - temperature value ( [ eq : s0 ] ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy_fp ] as solid line together with the high- and low - temperature expressions ( [ eq : s_fp_hight ] ) and ( [ eq : s_fp_lowt ] ) , respectively , as dotted lines .    ) and its zero - temperature value ( [ eq : s0 ] ) for a free brownian particle subject to ohmic dissipation of strength @xmath6 .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to the high- and low - temperature expressions ( [ eq : s_fp_hight ] ) and ( [ eq : s_fp_lowt ] ) , respectively . ]    from ( [ eq : s_fp ] ) it is clear , that the difference @xmath44 depends on the temperature only through the dimensionless quantity @xmath51 which , in view of our discussion in the introduction , should be expected . as @xmath6 decreases , the high - temperature region effectively becomes increasingly larger .",
    "however , the divergence of ( [ eq : s_fp_hight ] ) in the zero - temperature limit is avoided by a crossover to the low - temperature behavior ( [ eq : s_fp_lowt ] ) below temperatures of the order of @xmath52 . in this low - temperature regime",
    ", the dependence on @xmath51 immediately implies a nontrivial limit of vanishing coupling to the heat bath as discussed in connection with ( [ eq : s_fp_lowt ] ) .    as we will see in more detail in the discussion of the casimir entropy , a difference between the casimir problem and the free brownian particle consists in the value taken by the entropy at zero temperature .",
    "while the casimir entropy goes to zero in that limit , we found a nonvanishing entropy constant @xmath43 for the free brownian particle .",
    "@xmath43 will be positive provided that the broadening of the levels due to the coupling to the heat bath is larger than the ground - state energy .",
    "the casimir entropy , on the other hand , can exhibit negative values of the entropy under certain circumstances .",
    "this raises the question whether in the case of the free brownian particle the entropy can drop below @xmath43 .",
    "while this does not necessarily imply a negative entropy , the entropies in the two situations would nevertheless behave nonmontonically . as a direct consequence ,",
    "measurable thermodynamic quantities like the specific heat could in both cases take on negative values .",
    "this was indeed found for the free brownian particle @xcite .    for strictly ohmic damping , @xmath53",
    ", the entropy @xmath36 will always be larger than @xmath43 and we therefore have to consider the case of finite cutoff frequency @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath54 , which for the damping kernel ( [ eq : drudekernel ] ) corresponds to @xmath55 , there exists a temperature range where @xmath56 and where the specific heat becomes negative @xcite .",
    "the nonmonotonic behavior of the entropy is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : entropy_fp_drude ] for decreasing values of the cutoff frequency @xmath57 and @xmath58 from the upper to the lower curve .",
    "in addition to the appearance of a nonmonotonic behavior , one observes that with decreasing cutoff frequency @xmath35 and therefore decreasing coupling to the bath oscillators , the entropy follows the high - temperature behavior ( [ eq : s_fp_hight ] ) represented by the dotted line down to lower temperatures .",
    "this underlines once more the nontrivial limit of vanishing coupling to the heat bath .    ) and its zero - temperature value ( [ eq : s0 ] ) for a free brownian particle subject to ohmic dissipation with a high - frequency cutoff @xmath59 , and @xmath58 from the upper to the lower curve .",
    "the dotted line represents the high - temperature expression ( [ eq : s_fp_hight ] ) . ]    the nonmonotonicity of the entropy however does not put the thermodynamic stability of the system in question . as pointed out before ,",
    "an entropy based on the reduced partition function ( [ eq : partfunc ] ) is the difference of two positive entropies referring to the heat bath and the heat bath in the presence of the free particle @xcite .",
    "in the context of this paper , we are not interested in a realistic description of experiments @xcite . exploring the casimir effect but rather in a theoretical analysis of the effects of a finite conductivity of the mirrors , in particular at low temperatures .",
    "we therefore assume an idealized geometrical setup where two infinitely large metallic plane mirrors are positioned in parallel at a distance @xmath3 of each other . by an appropriate choice of the permittivity",
    ", we will account for basic features of the optical response of real mirrors , namely the low reflectivity at high frequencies and the finite conductivity at low frequencies .",
    "the high - frequency optical response of a metal is well described within the plasma model in terms of the relative permittivity @xmath60 here , @xmath13 denotes the plasma frequency which is related to the plasma wavelength by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the speed of light . for gold ,",
    "the plasma wavelength is @xmath63 m and the finite plasma frequency becomes appreciable for mirror distances @xmath64 m @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we assume for all numerical calculations a fixed value of @xmath65 , corresponding to a mirror distance of one micrometer which is a typical order of magnitude in experiments .",
    "the relative permittivity @xmath66 is related to the conductivity @xmath67 of the mirrors by @xmath68 here , the conductivity @xmath69 is expressed as a frequency from which the conductivity in si units is obtained as @xmath70 with the permittivity of vacuum @xmath71 . according to ( [ eq : epsilon_sigma ] ) , applying the relative permittivity ( [ eq : epsilon_plasma ] ) for all frequencies down to @xmath72 would imply the assumption of an infinite dc conductivity which is certainly unacceptable for normal metals .",
    "the simplest model ensuring a finite dc conductivity is the drude model with the relative permittivity @xmath73 it is obtained from ( [ eq : epsilon_plasma ] ) by introducing a relaxation frequency @xmath6 and leads to the dc conductivity @xmath74 we will assume @xmath6 to be independent of temperature thus implying a nonvanishing conductivity at zero temperature due to crystal defects or impurities @xcite .    taking the dc conductivity of gold , @xmath75 , one obtains for the relaxation frequency @xmath76 .",
    "assuming mirror distances of one micrometer or smaller , we find @xmath77 .",
    "the relaxation frequency therefore is typically small compared to @xmath78 and to @xmath79 . on the other hand , for the conductivity assumed here ,",
    "the ratio @xmath80 is of the order of one at room temperature .",
    "although the drude model can not be expected to give an accurate description of all details of the permittivity of a real metal @xcite , it is the simplest model accounting for a finite dc conductivity and therefore deserves to be analyzed in detail . as apart from the thermal frequency @xmath81",
    "the relaxation frequency @xmath6 is the smallest frequency scale in the problem , it is interesting to investigate the limit @xmath9 .    the reason why this limit can be nontrivial becomes apparent when the reflection coefficients are considered . before doing so , we introduce the notation for frequencies and wavevectors which will be used in the sequel .",
    "the wavevector of an electromagnetic mode is @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the component orthogonal to the mirrors while @xmath84 is a two - dimensional vector parallel to the mirrors .",
    "although it is possible and sometimes useful to keep frequencies real @xcite , here we will employ imaginary frequencies @xmath85 and wave - vector components @xmath86 so that the dispersion relation becomes @xmath87 .    with this notation the reflection coefficient for the transverse electric ( te ) mode",

    "this does not affect the zero frequency reflection of the tm mode but for the te mode one finds a vanishing reflection coefficient @xmath93 for the drude model in contrast to a nonvanishing value for the plasma model @xcite .",
    "clearly , such a behavior is not compatible with a continuous transition from the drude to the plasma model for @xmath9 .",
    "the zero - frequency behavior of the reflection coefficient has a dramatic consequence for the casimir force at high temperatures .",
    "while within the plasma model the te modes contribute to the casimir force , this is not the case within the drude model . as a consequence , in the latter case",
    "the casimir force arises only from the tm modes and is thus reduced by a factor of two with respect to the plasma model @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen an extensive debate about the existence of this reduction factor and its compatibility with thermodynamics ( for a review see _",
    "e.g. _  refs .   and ) .",
    "interestingly , a rather independent approach based on a microscopic study of the force between two slabs containing an electron plasma in the classical and semiclassical regime also led to a reduction of the casimir force by a factor of two @xcite as does the consideration of the classical bohr - van leeuwen theorem @xcite .    in the following",

    "thus makes it possible that in the first case for nonvanishing values of @xmath6 and in the second case for @xmath11 the entropy goes to zero in the zero - temperature limit as it should .",
    "we have considered the thermodynamics of a free damped quantum particle on the one hand and of the electromagnetic field enclosed between two mirrors of finite conductivity , on the other hand .",
    "if in the first case the normalization volume is very large and in the second case the plasma frequency and the frequency @xmath15 associated with the mirror separation @xmath3 are large compared to the relaxation frequency of the drude - type mirrors , the temperature dependence in both cases is dominated by the interplay of two energy scales : the thermal energy @xmath17 and the energy @xmath7 associated with the damping or the relaxation present in a drude metal .",
    "in such a situation , the limits of zero temperature and zero damping do not commute . for",
    "any finite temperature , the limit of small damping or relaxation will restore the classical high - temperature behavior .",
    "this behavior , if continued down to zero temperature , could potentially violate requirements imposed by thermodynamics .",

    "the ratio @xmath8 is close to one , placing these experiments into the transition region between the classical and the quantum regime .",
    "the casimir effect with its strong coupling between the electromagnetic field modes and the metallic mirrors is a prime example where the coupling between system and environment is far from negligible . in such cases",
    ", the coupling will affect the thermodynamic properties in the quantum regime and even lead to negative values for the entropy or the specific heat at low temperatures .",
    "such negative values result from the restriction to a subsystem and are therefore not in contradiction with thermodynamic principles .",
    "the appearance of a negative entropy or specific heat is not specific to the free brownian quantum particle @xcite and the casimir effect @xcite but is also known for example in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "while there exists a direct analogy in the low - temperature behavior of the free brownian particle and the casimir effect , there is an apparent difference at high temperatures . in the first case , the limit of vanishing damping leads to the free particle while in the second case , even in the limit of vanishing relaxation frequency , the te mode contributes within the plasma model while it does not for the drude model .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the quantity which enters the analogy for the casimir effect is not the casimir force itself but the difference of the casimir forces in the drude and the plasma model .",
    "it is this difference which in the classical limit becomes independent of the relaxation frequency and thus within our analogy accounts for the suppression of the casimir force by a factor of two at high temperatures .",
