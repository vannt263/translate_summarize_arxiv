    "we denote it by @xmath214 . the maximum success probability for the hypothetical discrimination problem is then given by @xmath215 .",
    "let us impose an extra constraint on povm @xmath216 in this discrimination problem : @xmath217 by this additional condition , the success probability ( [ eq : p_circ_qr ] ) and the average error probability ( [ eq : p_times_qr ] ) are reduced to @xmath218 and the problem becomes equivalent to discrimination between the two mixed states @xmath123 and @xmath124 with occurrence probabilities @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "in this paper , we considered a state discrimination problem which interpolates minimum - error and unambiguous discriminations by introducing a margin for the probability of error . in the case of two pure states with general occurrence probabilities , we obtained the optimal success probability in a fully analytic form .",
    "our final remark is about the possibility of optimal local discrimination between two multipartite pure states .",

    "an interesting question is whether the parties sharing the states can achieve the globally optimal success probability by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
