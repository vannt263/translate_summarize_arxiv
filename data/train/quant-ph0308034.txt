    "the field of information and computation has experienced a fundamental innovation since the last decades of the twentieth century , through the combination with the theory of quantum physics .",
    "the new - born theory of quantum information and computation opens a broad field of potential applications @xcite .",
    "its recent application into the theory of games extends the classical game theory @xcite , which is in fact one of the cornerstones of modern economics , into the quantum domain .",
    "it has shown that quantum games may have great advantages over their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "many of the current works focus on games in which the players has finite number of classical strategies and/or the information is symmetrically distributed among the players . while games with continuous set of strategies and those of asymmetric information , which represent much realistic significance @xcite , especially in market situations in economics , are not given much attention .",
    "however the quantization of these games deserves thorough investigations , and interesting results could be obtained .",
    "the investigations on quantum games might provide new insights into the field of economics research , as it does in the field of computation , communication and others .",
    "there are several reasons that quantizing games that could be applied in economics may be interesting .",
    "first , market situations could be in their nature regarded as games , their quantization may be of the same interests as quantizing games @xcite .",
    "second , in any market situation , information and communication are of most importance",
    ". however , information is  as we live in a quantum world  legitimate to think of as quantum information , and communication may also need to think of as quantum communication ( at least in the near future ) @xcite , it therefore might be interesting to investigate the quantization of market situations as games , and interesting quantum features might be explored .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the quantum form of a particular game of the market situation known as the cournot s",
    "duopoly @xcite of asymmetric information , based on the previously proposed physical model for continuous - variable quantum games @xcite . in the quantum game of asymmetric information ,",
    "the interaction  between the quantum entanglement and the informational asymmetry creates interesting properties of the game . due to the presence of informational asymmetry , the quantum entanglement has contradictive effects : on the one hand it promotes cooperation and potentially increases the profits , but on the other hand it potentially decreases the profits at the same time . whether the quantum game outperforms its classical counterpart depends strongly on not only the quantum entanglement but also the informational asymmetry .",
    "we now briefly recall the classical cournot s",
    "duopoly @xcite of asymmetric information . in a simple scenario , firm 1 and firm 2",
    "simultaneously choose the quantities ( the strategies ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , of a homogeneous product .",
    "let @xmath2 be the total quantity , and the market price be@xmath3{ll}% a - q & \\text { , for } q\\leqslant a\\\\ 0 & \\text { , for } q > a \\end{array } \\right .   .\\ ] ] denote the unit cost of firm 1 and 2 by @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "yet firm 2 knows with certainty the unit cost of its product ( @xmath5 ) as well as that of firm 1 s ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the quantity of firm 2 when @xmath10 and @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath18 be the quantity of firm 1 . if @xmath19 , then firm 2 needs to set @xmath20 to maximize its profit@xmath21.\\ ] ] firm 1 needs to set @xmath22 to maximize its _ expected _ profit@xmath23 where@xmath24.\\ ] ] solving the three optimization problems yields the bayes - nash equilibrium @xcite @xmath25 where@xmath26,\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta &   = c_{h}-c_{l}.\\label{eq 5}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the special instance with @xmath27 and @xmath28 reduces to the original model of symmetric information , with the unique nash equilibrium@xmath29 and",
    "the payoffs being@xmath30 however this equilibrium fails to be the pareto optimum @xcite , which could easily be found to be@xmath31 with@xmath32",
    "the quantum structure is given in fig .",
    "[ model ] , which is the same as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . the necessity to include continuous - variable quantum systems",
    "is that a continuous set of _ distinguishable _ states are necessary to represent all the possible outcomes of classical strategies , due to the _ distinguishability _ of classical strategies . in fig .",
    "[ model ] , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two vacuum states , _",
    "e.g. _ of two single - mode electromagnetic fields respectively belong to the two firms . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are unitary operators , which are known to both firms and should be symmetric with respect to the interchange of the two firms to guarantee a fair competition .",
    "the initial state of the game is@xmath37 strategic moves of firm @xmath8 is associated with unitary local operator @xmath38 .",
    "the final state of the game is denoted by@xmath39    [ ptb ]    fig1.eps    it is straightforward to set the final measurement be corresponding to the observables @xmath40 ( the position  operators ) for firm @xmath8 , where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of firm @xmath8 s electromagnetic field . if the measurement result is @xmath43 , then the individual quantity is determined by @xmath44 , and hence the profit by@xmath45 where the superscript @xmath46  denotes quantum .",
    "however , as will be shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq f ] ) , in the case we considered in the present paper , the final state of the game @xmath47 is a tensor product of two coherent states , respectively belonging to the two firms .",
    "one can not have a deterministic measurement result of @xmath48 , since a coherent state is not an eigenstate of @xmath48 .",
    "this poses a problem because the quantity @xmath49 is affected by uncertainty @xmath50 .",
    "one possible method to reduce this uncertainty is to perform appropriate _ squeezing _ operation on the final state before the measurement according to @xmath48 is carried out .",
    "the uncertainty of the measurement result of @xmath48 could be reduced , at the cost of increasing the uncertainty of the measurement result of @xmath51 . in this paper",
    ", we assume the limit case that the state is infinitely squeezed , so that the uncertainty of the measurement result of @xmath48 tends to zero .",
    "consequently , given a coherent state @xmath52 , the final measurement could deterministically yield @xmath53 in this limit .",
    "the classical cournot s duopoly can be faithfully represented when @xmath54 ( the identity operator ) .",
    "the set@xmath55 is the quantum counterpart of the classical strategic space , where @xmath56 ( the momentum  operators ) . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the minimal  extension , _",
    "i.e. _ we maintain the strategic space unexpanded ( @xmath57 for firm @xmath8 ) while only extend the initial state @xmath58 to be entangled .",
    "this minimal extension guarantees that any features of the game not seen in the classical form could be completely due to the quantum entanglement .",
    "however it is also possible to find a quantum version that includes both the entangled state and the expanded strategic spaces .",
    "the choice of the entangling operator is not unique . even though the requirement that for vanishing entanglement the classical game should be reproduced can not uniquely specify this operator in the case presented in this paper .",
    "however a possible and legitimate one is@xmath59 the initial state is exactly the two - mode squeezed vacuum state@xmath60 where @xmath61 is known as the squeezing parameter and can be reasonably regarded as a measure of entanglement .",
    "detailed calculation reveals that if firm @xmath8 s strategy is @xmath62 , then the final state is@xmath63 hence the quantities read out from the final measurement are@xmath64 the total quantity is @xmath65 , and the market price is @xmath66 .",
    "therefore profits are@xmath67   , \\nonumber\\\\ u_{2h\\left (   l\\right )   } ^{q}\\left (   x_{1},x_{2}\\right )    &   = \\left ( x_{2}\\cosh\\gamma+x_{1}\\sinh\\gamma\\right )   \\left [   p - c_{h\\left (   l\\right ) } \\right ]   , \\label{eq 2}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here for convenience we directly denote the strategy by @xmath68 when it is @xmath69 .",

    "i.e. _ there is no asymmetry in the information distribution .",
    "however for fixed @xmath11 , @xmath82 increases as @xmath86 increases , and for fixed @xmath86 , @xmath82 increases as @xmath11 approaches @xmath87 .",
    "this means that the more asymmetrical the information distribution is , the larger is @xmath82 .",
    "it is in this sense that we regard @xmath82 as a measure of the informational asymmetry of the game .",
    "we now investigate how the profits depend on the entanglement and the amount of informational asymmetry .",

    "( [ eq 4 ] ) shows that there is a threshold for the amount of informational asymmetry , @xmath91 . if @xmath92,@xmath93 which means the profits monotonously decrease as @xmath81 increases . in this case , the quantum game is definitely inferior to the classical game .",
    "it is also interesting to see that if @xmath94 we can always find that for some value of @xmath81 , @xmath88 will be less than zero while @xmath89 remains positive . in this case , lacking information makes firm 1 lose money in business on average , yet it is beyond firm 1 s means to get out of it .    in the case that @xmath95,@xmath96 the profits increase as @xmath81 increases when @xmath81 is small .",
    "however we can find @xmath97 satisfying@xmath98 hence @xmath88 and @xmath89 simultaneously reach the maximum at @xmath99 .",
    "but when @xmath100 the profits decrease .    in the limit that @xmath101 , we have@xmath102 while in the classical game",

    "while for @xmath92 , the quantum game is definitely inferior to the classical game , and the profits will get worse when the entanglement increases . to be illustrative , we plot firm 1 s profit ( divided by @xmath117 ) with different settings of @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ compare ] , in which all the above intriguing features could be seen .",

    "( [ eq 3 ] ) represents the impact of the informational asymmetry .",
    "this impact will decrease the payoff with the presence of entanglement , not only for the player who lacks information but also for the one who possesses more information .",
    "a special instance is the case with @xmath83 ( see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in which the classical game turns back to the original one of symmetric information proposed by cournot @xcite . while in the maximally entangled limit with @xmath101 , we have @xmath118 , which is exactly the pareto optimum . in this case",
    "the initial state tends towards the singular limit @xmath119d@xmath120 .",
    "it is this limiting state , first considered by einstein , podolsky and rosen , which enables the two firms to best cooperate , and therefore to be best rewarded .",
    "the dilemma - like situation is thus completely removed in this limit .",
    "we investigated the quantization of a game of a market situation known as the cournot s duopoly of asymmetric information , based on the continuous - variable model for quantum games given in ref .",
    "we found that , with the presence of informational asymmetry , the quantum entanglement has contradictive effects . on the one hand the quantum entanglement promotes cooperation and potentially increases the profits . while on the other hand , due to the asymmetric distribution of information , the quantum entanglement induces a decreasing effect not only to the player who lacks information but also to the one who possesses more information .",
