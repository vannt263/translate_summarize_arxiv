    "it has been known for many years that 1d systems can support unusual correlated electron phenomena such as luttinger liquid physics .",
    "however , electrical and thermal transport in real materials are usually not governed by the free low - energy luttinger liquid fixed point but by an interplay between dangerously irrelevant operators scattering the currents and conserved quantities protecting them.@xcite    in order to connect to actual experiments , it is thus essential to study generic microscopic models . over the last decades",
    "a significant number of works @xcite investigated equilibrium charge ( or spin ) transport properties . in particular , the question whether or not so - called integrable models , which possess a complete set of local conserved quantities , can support dissipationless currents at finite temperature was addressed extensively .",
    "less is known about the quantitative effects of integrability - breaking perturbations which are naturally present in any experimental system , and even the qualitative question whether the linear - response conductivity of a nonintegrable model can still be infinite is not answered conclusively.@xcite while experimental measurements of thermal transport driven by a temperature gradient in quasi-1d spin systems already exist,@xcite only a few works investigate this theoretically.@xcite studying nonequilibrium thermal ( or charge ) transport is complicated in general  one reason being that is not even clear whether the long - time dynamics can be described by a low - energy theory  and constitutes one of the most active areas of research in strongly correlated condensed matter physics.@xcite    the primary goal of our work is to obtain quantitative results on steady - state energy flow both near and far from equilibrium and to understand the effects of integrability and correlations .",
    "this is motivated by the experiments listed above and by recent technical advances in dynamical simulations.@xcite as prototypical models we consider a xxz spin-@xmath6 chain in the presence of two perturbations ( dimerization and a staggered magnetic field ) which break integrability@xcite as well the quantum ising model .",
    "using density matrix renormalization group methods we demonstrate that the nonequilibrium energy current driven by a temperature gradient @xmath0 relaxes fast to a finite steady - state value if the linear - response thermal conductivity is infinite,@xcite i.e.  if the drude weight @xmath1 is nonzero .",
    "our data indicate that the dimerized chain might support such dissipationless transport ( @xmath2 ) despite the fact that it is nonintegrable ( @xmath1 can be extracted from the asymptote of the equilibrium energy current correlation function,@xcite and we can not exclude that the latter decays on a hidden large temperature - independent time scale ) .",
    "one of our main results is that for a large class of problems the steady - state current takes , within numerical accuracy , the functional form @xmath7 in words , its dependence on the two temperatures is tightly constrained : the steady - state current is the difference between the total radiated power from the left and right leads .",

    "suppose that the typical velocity of the system is @xmath93 , and consider energy currents at a time @xmath94 .",
    "for any such time , the middle of each reservoir is essentially unperturbed from its initial state , so the local energy current is zero ( see the curve at @xmath90 ) .",
    "the local energy currents rise in the vicinity of the junctions ( @xmath89 ) ; let @xmath95 be the _ spatially integrated _ energy current at the @xmath96 to @xmath97 boundary at time @xmath98 , and similarly for the other boundaries .",
    "of course once @xmath99 the energy currents are no longer localized in the region of the boundaries and @xmath100 is not defined .",
    "the initial energy current around the ring is zero and is a conserved quantity of the connected system , so the total energy current must still be zero .",
    "in other words , for all times @xmath101 we have ( see figure [ fig : ring ] ) @xmath102 this is not the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : cyclicform ] ) , however , because @xmath3 is the current at a point , while @xmath103 is spatially integrated and has some complicated profile in general . for the conformal field theory limit ,",
    "all excitations have a single velocity @xmath104 and @xmath103 is expected to be dominated by @xmath105 . to summarize",
    ", general principles suggest that there is a sum rule ( at all times less than an upper cutoff determined by the reservoir size ) relating the three pairs of temperatures ; however , the detailed form of this sum rule is not the same as the observed relationship between steady - state currents , although they are related in the conformal limit .",
    "now we proceed to give a definition of the stefan - boltzmann function @xmath5 and then argue that the steady - state current is determined by the difference in the stefan - boltzmann functions of the two reservoirs . consider a large reservoir of size @xmath106 prepared at initial temperature @xmath66 . at @xmath33 , it is connected to semi - infinite leads at each end , and these leads are prepared at some reference temperature , say 0 ( ignoring any subtleties from possible symmetry breaking ) . at some very long time",
    "so that no excitations remain in the reservoir , let @xmath107 be the total energy current integrated over all sites to the right of the reservoir .",
    "this `` right - moving energy current '' will be extensive in @xmath106 , so we define @xmath108 as the radiated right - moving energy current per site .    in order to give some intuition for the existence of a steady state and stefan - boltzmann law even when there is not a single velocity as in the conformal case , we present a free - particle example in appendix a. this model has a gaussian distribution of velocities and a steady - state energy current at the reservoir boundary that is determined solely by the total radiated power as described above .",
    "the variation in particle velocity does not otherwise affect the answer .",
    "the steady state lives for a time that is arbitrarily long as the reservoir size becomes infinite , but is short compared to the amount of time it takes for the reservoir to radiate all its energy , as at that time there is no current left at the reservoir boundaries .",
    "this notion of the steady state as actually a long - time phenomenon compared to transients ( and diverging in the limit that the reservoir is infinite ) , but a short - time phenomenon compared to the time on which @xmath107 is defined , is used in our argument for the interacting case below .    now comes a subtle and surprising point .",
    "the cyclic relation at finite times in ( [ eq : currentsum ] ) means that the behavior of the energy current at any of the junctions is remarkably constrained : any change that only affects one junction but not the other two will not affect the spatially integrated current around the junction .",
    "for example , consider the two different initial conditions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spacer]a : one is the abrupt junction simulated in our numerics , where a single bond is restored at @xmath33 ; the other contains a `` spacer '' of @xmath109 bonds , all of which are turned on at @xmath33 .",
    "the total energy current integrated over bonds between these two reservoirs must be exactly the same in these two cases , up to some long time ( we assume that the reservoir size @xmath110 . )",
    "but for a long spacer @xmath111 , the spatial profile of the current will look different at short times than for @xmath112 : for the long spacer , the current consists of one right - moving patch from the left lead and one left - moving patch from the right lead , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : spacer]b . for @xmath112 , the current is expected to be spatially monotonic , or at least not to decouple into these separated regions .",
    "is different between the geometries with and without a `` spacer '' region prepared at some reference temperature , but the spatial integrals are the same .",
    "( b ) two large reservoirs of size @xmath57 can be viewed as made up of translated pairs of smaller sub - reservoirs of size @xmath106 .",
    "the numbers indicate the pairings of the sub - reservoirs .",
    "the sum of many translated copies of a function approaches a constant , as long as the function is smoothly varying on the scale of the translations .",
    "if the energy current can indeed be viewed as such a sum , then the existence of a stefan - boltzmann function is recovered , independent of the precise shape of the energy current distribution . ]",
    "this argument indicates that the nontrivial time evolution of spatially integrated current is exactly the same whether the right - movers and left - movers pass through each other or are spatially separated , i.e. , treating the problem as two separate pulses and adding them together gives exactly the right total current .",
    "we now give a ( non - rigorous ) picture for how a steady state described by a stefan - boltzmann function can exist independent of the `` pulse shape '' , i.e. , the spatial distribution of energy current , which is certainly sensitive to interactions .",
    "consider each large reservoir , now of size @xmath57 , as made up of many contiguous sub - reservoirs of size @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spacer]b ) .",
    "we can pair sub - reservoirs as shown so that the total problem is a combination of copies translated by @xmath106 .",
    "the point of the small sub - reservoirs is that the observation time for the steady state is long enough that the sub - reservoirs are in the long - time limit where @xmath107 is defined , although the total reservoir is not .",
    "the shape of these contributions could be modified by being in a non - trivial background , but their total weight is not , and as we are at long times , we expect the pulse shape to be broad compared to @xmath106 . now whatever the shape of the contribution from a pair of sub - reservoirs is , its total weight is @xmath113 . when we add together many translated copies of the same shape , we obtain a constant , since by the poisson summation formula @xmath114 for functions @xmath115 that do not vary strongly on the scale of @xmath116 .",
    "so this constant is exactly @xmath117 , the desired result .",
    "the conformal limit is a case where the subreservoir size can be taken to be arbitrarily small . in words ,",
    "the steady state exists in a time window where all that matters is the total energy per length of right - movers emitted from the left , less that of left - movers emitted from the right .    ) to absorb half of the excitations from each initial reservoir ; which half are absorbed ( right - movers or left - movers ) depends on the reservoir s temperature .",
    "the absorbers are then removed and further evolution is unitary . energy current is conserved and , if the dispersion of velocities leads to a translation - invariant final state , that final state must have energy current given by the stefan - boltzmann prediction . ]",
    "we can give a specific example for which this picture is correct by constructing a geometry , different from the original geometry of two semi - infinite leads , for which the time evolution can be shown to give a steady - state described by the stefan - boltzmann relation , even in the presence of interactions .",
    "this sidesteps the difficulty of solving the time evolution from the non - translation - invariant initial state ",
    "it is difficult to prove in general even that a translation - invariant steady state exists .",
    "we would like to make a translation - invariant system of interacting particles whose final state has left - movers originating at a different temperature from right - movers . to do so , consider the process in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol]a .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the model has a finite range of particle velocities and that there is a `` vacuum '' state with no particles .",
    "two regions of different temperatures are spaced by a large enough region of vacuum that the left - movers from the right region fail to interact with the left - movers from the other until both types of particles have moved out of their original reservoir regions .",
    "particle absorbers , which could be extra lengths of spin chain for example , are placed at the left and right ends of the system and absorb left - movers from the left region and right - movers from the left region .",
    "after this absorption , the absorbers are removed and the remaining evolution is unitary .",
    "repeat this arrangement in a discretely translation - invariant way , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol]b .",
    "the further time evolution will preserve the total energy current , even though the particles coming from different reservoirs will now interact . assuming that a homogeneous energy current is reached in the final state because of the dispersion of particle velocities , the energy current in this final state has to be @xmath118 $ ] , where @xmath80 is the volume fraction occupied by the reservoirs and @xmath5 is the directed radiated energy current per unit length .",
    "in other words , the conservation of energy current means that , in this specific example where left - movers and right - movers are drawn from different temperatures , the final state is described by a stefan - boltzmann function .",
    "however , the existence of the same energy current in the actual two - reservoir geometry is so far more difficult to establish .",
    "while particle velocities are certainly modified by the density of particles from the other reservoir in an interacting system , this modification need not alter the total energy current at the boundary , as in the example above .",
    "a quantum field theory approach to thermal steady states leads in some cases to a factorization of the density matrix from which the existence of a stefan - boltzmann function follows , although integrability and conserved energy current seem to play less of a role in this approach  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that applying this field - theory approach to the steady - state energy current in the massive sine - gordon model gives behavior that slightly violates the existence of a stefan - boltzmann function  @xcite , at the level of a few percent .",
    "it is not clear whether this discrepancy indicates a fundamental difference in the type of steady state ( as , analytically , solving the time evolution for all times to see the unique steady state emerge is not possible in either approach ) .",
    "finally , we note that the same logic presented in this section would apply to charge currents in a homogeneous system with a conserved charge current , but the xxz model s charge current is not conserved ( does not commute with the hamiltonian ) , although there is a drude weight .",
    "within the accuracy of our numerics , the steady state current does not depend jointly on @xmath30 and @xmath31 but rather is just the difference of the function @xmath5 evaluated at the two temperatures .",
    "it is known that at low @xmath66 this property should hold as a result of conformal invariance,@xcite with @xmath119 . earlier in this paper",
    "we gave a somewhat lengthy analytic argument suggesting this result ; in order to make it less mysterious , we now show that a relatively simple approximation for the isotropic xxx ferromagnet ( @xmath120 ) gives a reasonable description of @xmath75 at all temperatures and is exact in the low - temperature limit .    ) of two estimates for the function @xmath5 whose differences give the steady - state energy current @xmath3 via @xmath121 between reservoirs @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
