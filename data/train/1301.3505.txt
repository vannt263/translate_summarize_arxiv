    "electric power can be generated in a highly efficient manner via thermionic energy conversion from heat created by focused solar irradiation or combustion of fossil fuels  @xcite .",
    "generators based on the thermionic process could , if implemented , considerably enhance the efficiency of focused solar energy conversion or of coal combustion power plants  @xcite , yielding a corresponding reduction of co@xmath0 emissions . in thermionic energy conversion",
    "a vacuum is applied as the active material between the electrodes , rather than the solid conductors that give rise to the thermoelectric effect  @xcite .",
    "thereby , the parasitic heat conduction from the hot to the cold electrode is radically decreased .",
    "thermionic generators can operate with input temperatures @xmath1that are sufficiently high to match the temperatures at which concentrating - solar power plants or fossil - fuel power stations generate heat . in principle , electric power may therefore be generated from these energy sources with outstanding efficiency because the maximum possible efficiency ",
    "the carnot efficiency @xmath2  increases with @xmath1 , where @xmath3is the generators output temperature .",
    "in contrast , a significant amount of energy is wasted today in the conversion of heat to electricity .",
    "coal , from which @xmath4% of the worlds electricity is currently generated  @xcite , is burned in power stations at @xmath5 , whereas , due to technical limitations , the steam turbines driven by this heat are operated below @xmath6 , to give but one example .",
    "however , thermionic generators have never been deployed to harvest solar energy or to convert combustion heat into electricity in power stations  @xcite or cars  @xcite , although the conversion process is straightforward and appears to be achievable : electrons are evaporated from a heated emitter electrode into vacuum , then the electrons drift to the surface of a cooler collector electrode , where they condense  @xcite .",
    "if used for solar energy harvesting , the quantum nature of light can be exploited for great efficiency gains by using photon - enhanced thermionic emission ( pete )  @xcite .",
    "pete employs the photoeffect to enhance electron emission by lifting the electron energy in a semiconducting emitter across the bandgap @xmath7 into the conduction band , from where the electrons are thermally emitted . as a result of the electron flow ,",
    "the electrochemical potentials of the emitter and collector differ by a voltage @xmath8 , and an output current @xmath9 can be sourced through a load resistor @xmath10 . turning this elegant operation principle into commercial devices",
    "has not yet been possible , however , because space - charge clouds suppress the emission current for emitter - collector distances of @xmath11@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "practical fabrication of emitter - collector assemblies that operate with the required close tolerances at a temperature difference @xmath13 of many hundred kelvin was found to be highly challenging  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for @xmath14 , near - field infrared thermal losses between emitter and collector become large  @xcite . for large @xmath15 ,",
    "it has only been possible to suppress the space charges by neutralizing them , which was done by inserting cs@xmath16 ions into the space - charge cloud  @xcite , a method used in two @xmath17 nuclear - powered thermionic generators aboard experimental soviet satellites  @xcite . with that approach , compensating the space charge by ion injection causes a @xmath18 loss of output power @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "novel schemes to suppress the space charges by optimizing the generation of cs@xmath16  @xcite have yet to be demonstrated .",
    "since the 1950s , when the space - charge problem was first approached  @xcite , it has remained the main obstacle to achieving efficient thermionic generators  @xcite .",
    "+   +    here we show that the space - charge problem can be solved in a plasma - free process .",
    "this process involves only electrons but no ions .",
    "it is therefore best characterized as `` thermoelectronic '' . to remove the static space charges ,",
    "a positively charged gate electrode is inserted into the emitter  collector space to create a potential trough . in a virtually lossless process",
    "this trough accelerates the electrons away from the emitter surface and decelerates them as they approach the collector ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "a nominally homogeneous magnetic field @xmath20 applied along the electron trajectories prevents loss of the electrons to a gate current @xmath21by directing them through holes in the gate on helical paths circling straight axes .",
    "this process turns the static space - charge cloud , which previously blocked the electron emission , into a useful output current ( fig .",
    "the design is analogous to that of ion thrusters used for spacecraft propulsion .    to investigate the effectiveness of the gate in removing the space charges , we fabricated a set of thermoelectronic generators as model systems ( figs .",
    "2a , b ; see appendix  [ sec : setup ] ) .",
    "the function of the generators was furthermore modeled by numerical calculations of the electron emission , space - charge formation and electron trajectories ( see appendix  [ sec : model - calc ] ) .",
    "experiment and model calculations provide consistent evidence that , by applying emitter - gate voltages of @xmath22 , the exact value being a function of the geometrical design of the generator , we can indeed remove the static space - charge clouds ( figs .",
    "1b , c , 3a ) .",
    "the gate potential enables operation of the generators in vacuum with emitter ",
    "collector spacings of tens of micrometers ( see fig .",
    "+    although , as will be shown below , the generators operate with high efficiencies at large @xmath15 , the value of the emitter ",
    "collector current @xmath23decreases with @xmath15 .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "3b , which shows that the density @xmath24of the emitter ",
    "collector current at which the maximal output power is obtained , @xmath25 , scales for large @xmath15with @xmath26 . at small @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath24approaches the current density of gate - free generators , because the electric field becomes small inside the mesh holes if @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the grid - mesh diameter defined for hexagonal grids as the distance between opposite corners . for grids with finite conductor widths",
    ", @xmath24is furthermore reduced because for @xmath29 , a fraction of the emitted current is lost to @xmath21 .",
    "here , @xmath30 is the gate transparency , the fraction of the gate area not covered by the conductor .",
    "this effect can be minimized by optimizing the gate geometry and by inducing an inhomogeneous electron emission , for example by using nanotubes grown on the emitter . in the latter case , @xmath24may be increased further by gate - field - enhanced emission .",
    "having confirmed that the space - charge cloud has been removed , we now explore the efficiency @xmath31 , with which these generators transform heat into electric power .",
    "the output power of the generator , @xmath32 , is maximal for @xmath33 , where @xmath34and @xmath35are the work functions of the emitter and the collector  , respectively , and @xmath36 is the elementary charge . for larger @xmath8 ,",
    "some of the electrons lack the energy to reach the collector , whereas @xmath23is independent of @xmath8for smaller @xmath8 .",
    "we start to identify the efficiency limit by considering a simplified , ideal case , in which the input power @xmath37is converted completely into an emitter ",
    "collector current consisting only of electrons at the vacuum potential ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "if the electrons are only thermally emitted , the requirement that the back - emission current from the collector is so small that @xmath25is positive entails that @xmath39 ( see appendix  [ sec : model - calc : eff ] ) . to generate this ideal current ,",
    "a power of @xmath40 is required .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 is a strict upper limit for the heat  to  electric power conversion efficiency .",
    "this limit also applies to devices in which the photoelectric effect is used .    in real devices , @xmath42 is reduced by several loss channels , which include the above - neglected thermal energy carried from the emitter by @xmath25 , losses due to a finite @xmath21 , radiation losses from the emitter , thermal conduction of the wires contacting the electrodes , and ohmic losses .",
    "nevertheless , only the loss by the electron heat current causes a fundamental bound for the efficiency ; the other loss effects can in principle be reduced to very small values .",
    "figure  4 shows the results of the model calculations of the generator efficiencies as a function of the gate voltage , considering the above - mentioned losses ( see appendix  [ sec : model - calc : eff ] ) .",
    "starting at @xmath43 , @xmath42 increases with @xmath44as the gate potential sweeps the space charges into the collector .",
    "this increase demonstrates the usefulness of the gate field . at higher @xmath44",
    ", @xmath42 decreases because the space charges have been removed and @xmath44does not enhance @xmath25beyond the maximum emission current , but increases the power @xmath45 lost at the gate . for a given @xmath34",
    ", @xmath42 increases with increasing @xmath46due to higher emission currents until thermal radiation losses dominate . for the parameter range considered realistic for applications (",
    "_ e.g. _ , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49  @xcite ) , maximum efficiencies of @xmath50 are predicted .",
    "the calculated efficiencies ( figs .  4 )",
    "are consistent with previous calculations of efficiencies of thermionic generators that were presumed to be devoid of space charges  @xcite .",
    "they compare well with those of photovoltaic solar cells  @xcite , thermoelectric materials  @xcite , and focused solar mechanical generators  @xcite . the results on combined cycles shown in fig .",
    "4 reveal that by using thermoelectronic converters as topping cycles the efficiency of state - of - the - art coal combustion plants may be increased from @xmath51% to @xmath52% , corresponding to a reduction of emissions such as co@xmath0 by @xmath53 .",
    "optimization of the conversion efficiencies requires the development of metal or semiconductor surfaces with the desired effective work functions and electron affinities , respectively , which may also be done by nanostructuring the electrode surfaces .",
    "these surfaces need to be stable at high temperatures in vacuum .",
    "the tunability of the gate field opens possibilities to alter the converter parameters during operation .",
    "although the need to generate cs@xmath16 ions to neutralize the space - charge cloud is eliminated , adatoms of elements such as cs can be used to lower the work function of the electrodes , in particular of the collector . for high efficiency , the devices must be thermally optimized to minimize heat losses through the wiring .",
    "furthermore , thermal radiation of the emitter must be reflected efficiently onto the electrode . for ballistic electron transport between emitter and collector ,",
    "a vacuum of better than @xmath54 is also required , reminiscent of radio tubes .",
    "such devices may be realized , for example , in a flip - chip arrangement of oxide - coated wafers separated by tens of micrometers using thermal - insulation spacers as sketched in fig .  2c .",
    "this produces hundreds of watts of power from active areas of some @xmath55 .",
    "the magnetic fields , typically @xmath56 with large tolerances in strength and spatial distribution , can be generated by permanent magnets or , for applications such as power plants , by superconducting coils .",
    "achieving viable , highly efficient devices requires substantial further materials science efforts to develop the functional , possibly nanostructured materials , as well as engineering efforts to achieve a stable vacuum environment in order to minimize radiative and conductive heat losses , and to ensure competitive costs .",
    "remarkably , however , no obstacles of a fundamental nature appear to impede highly efficient power generation based on thermoelectronic energy converters .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge discussions with h.boschker , r.kneer , t.kopp , h.queisser , a.reller , h.ruder , a.schmehl , and j.weis as well as technical support by b.fenk and a.herrnberger .",
    "one of us ( thg ) would like to acknowledge informative conversations on the use of triodes with longitudinal magnetic fields to generate cs plasmas in thermionic generation with the late boris moyzhes , and also acknowledges support for part of the work at stanford by the u.s .",

    "in the model systems the electrodes were mechanically mounted in a vacuum chamber ( base pressure @xmath57 ) to facilitate the study of various converter configurations . as emitters , commercial , resistively heated bao - dispenser cathodes  @xcite with a temperature - dependent work function in the range @xmath58 and an emitting area of @xmath59 were used .",
    "the gates were laser - cut tungsten foils , the spacers aluminum oxide foils , and the collectors either consisted of polished steel plates or were bao - dispenser cathodes .",
    "the collector work functions were determined from the @xmath60-characteristics and additionally from the richardson - dushman saturation current .",
    "the emitters are ohmically heated , @xmath46was measured with a pyrometer .",
    "the magnetic field is generated by two stacks of ndfeb permanent magnets mounted on both sides of the emitter - gate - collector assembly .",
    "they created at the gates @xmath61 .",
    "photon - enhancement of the emission was not applied .",
    "electrical measurements were performed with source - measurement units ( keithley 2400 ) in 4-wire sensing .",
    "for the calculations of the current densities in gate - free , plane - parallel configurations the one - dimensional space - charge theory of langmuir  @xcite and hatsopoulos  @xcite was used to determine the space - charge potential . to incorporate the effect of the gate in the one - dimensional approach ,",
    "these models were extended to include the potential generated by an idealized gate , assumed to be a metal plate that is transparent for electrons and to create a homogeneous electric field .",
    "calculations of the electric field of a patterned metal grid with the commercial electric field solver coulomb  @xcite showed that for @xmath62 the generated field is virtually identical to the field of an idealized gate . the 3d calculations of the electric field distribution and the electron paths in the electric gate field and the applied magnetic field done with the commercial software lorentz  @xcite showed that the electrons are forced on quasi - one dimensional paths by the magnetic field and are thus channeled through the gate openings .    to explore",

    "we consider a symmetrical setup , the gate being located in the middle between emitter and collector . the gate potential for electrons is given by        if the thermally distributed initial velocity of emitted electrons is neglected , the poisson equation is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total electrostatic potential for negative charges , consisting of the contribution of the gate and the space - charge potential .",

    "@xmath75 can be determined from the richardson - dushman equation  @xcite ; it is a function of @xmath34and @xmath46 .",
    "this self - consistent differential equation has to be solved numerically .",
    "we used mathematica 8.0 for the numerical calculations . for each iteration step",
    ", the change of the space - charge potential has to be kept small , as already a small modification of @xmath66 can lead to a strong modification or even a divergence of the solution .",
    "therefore , the solution has to be approached slowly to impede a strong oscillatory behavior .        to take the inhomogeneities of the electric field of the gate electrode into account ,",
    "the interelectrode space was subdivided into narrow prisms , which extend from the emitter to the collector surface .",
    "we calculated the average gate potential in each prism with the electric field solver coulomb  @xcite .",
    "we apply a linear regression to determine the mean electric field , which can be used in the one - dimensional gate model .",
    "we then calculate the current density for each prism separately . thereby the interactions between the prisms were neglected , which is a good approximation for the case of small inhomogeneities in the space - charge density .",
    "the total current density was obtained by summing up the contributions from all tubes .    due to the high computational effort required to solve the 1d model including the",
    "thermally distributed initial electron velocity , the analytical solution ( eq .  [ eq:1 ] ) was used to determine the current density , which yields a good approximation in the voltage range considered .",
    "however , it does not account for the temperature - dependence of the current density .",
    "the richardson - dushman equation describes the current density for electrons emitted from a metal surface  @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by using the equation @xmath77 and integrating the fermi distribution @xmath78over all electrons with a positive velocity normal to the emitting surface , _ i.e. _ ,            assuming there is no space - charge cloud limiting the transfer of electrons across the vacuum gap , both @xmath63and the back - emission @xmath86from the collector are given by the respective richardson - dushman current densities ( eq .

    "[ eq:2 ] no gaussian - integral has to be determined and the resulting , discrete current density @xmath93does not have a term with coefficient @xmath94 .    as for any thermoelectronic generator ,",
    "an output power is only generated for @xmath95 implying @xmath96 it follows @xmath97 and therefore @xmath98 for @xmath99 , it follows @xmath100 and consequently : @xmath101    as can be seen , the efficiency approaches the carnot limit if the net current across the vacuum gap approaches zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the system approaches equilibrium .",

    "it has to be considered that @xmath110is also reduced by the space - charge potential .",
    "therefore , it is given by @xmath111 with the richardson - dushman current @xmath112and the maximum of the inter - electrode potential @xmath71 .    in the steady state",
    "the heat input equals the sum of all channels of heat loss from the emitter : @xmath113 with the electron cooling : @xmath114 the radiation cooling : @xmath115 ( @xmath116 : emitter area , @xmath117 : stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath118 : effective emissivity of the electrode system  @xcite ) and the heat conduction across the emitter lead : @xmath119 where the lead is assumed to be metallic and to follow the wiedemann - franz law . with the lorentz number @xmath120 the thermal conductivity",

    "the heat rejected by the collector ( @xmath123 ) is used to drive a secondary heat engine working at an efficiency of @xmath124 .",
    "the power @xmath125 produced by this engine is added to the total produced power , hence @xmath126        for solar heated thermoelectronic generators another fundamental channel for heat loss arises which we take into account : to couple solar radiation into the emitter , the emitter needs to provide a highly absorbing surface @xmath130(here `` b '' stands for black ) .",
    "this surface @xmath130has a high emissivity and therefore emits a thermal power @xmath131 .",
    "the resulting , reduced light  to  electricity efficiency @xmath132is expressed in terms of the heat  to  electricity efficiency @xmath42 : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the concentration - factor of the incoming solar radiation onto the absorbing spot on the emitter   is not to be confused with the effective concentration @xmath135that is relevant in the context of pete .",

    "for an ideal pete - device we then expect an electron yield of 1 electron per above - bandgap - photon  @xcite , as photoexcited electrons can then be assumed to be thermally emitted significantly faster than they recombine .    from @xmath138 , which defines the emission capability of the emitter",
    ", we then calculate the space - charge limited current density @xmath24from the 1d model described above ( taking into account the thermally distributed starting velocity of the electrons ) .",
