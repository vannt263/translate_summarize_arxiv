    "lubrication is usually considered to be a complex , multi - scale , mechanical engineering problem @xcite , demanding sophisticated numerical approaches for its solution @xcite .",
    "indeed , with few exceptions @xcite , pure hydrodynamic lubrication is rarely studied ; rather the focus is more usually on elasto - hydrodynamic lubrication ( ehl ) or boundary layer lubrication . given this ,",
    "the utility of a simplified scaling theory for pure hydrodynamic lubrication may be questioned .",
    "however there are numerous areas to which lubrication is additionally relevant , for example in understanding the origins of ` mouth - feel ' and the sensory properties of foods @xcite , and in ` psycho - rheology ' and the perception of skin care products @xcite .",
    "these diverse applications differ from the traditional engineering problem in that the lubricants are often structured liquids or soft solids with a non - newtonian rheology , and the gaps are large enough that pure hydrodynamic lubrication may be relevant .",
    "this motivates the development of the present scaling theory , which aims to provide insights and guidance for these unconventional application areas , and perhaps even reveal qualitatively new phenomena .    to begin with ,",
    "let me outline the fundamental mechanism of pure hydrodynamic lubrication @xcite .",
    "in a fully lubricated conjunction ( fig .  [",
    "fig : geom ] ) , mass conservation within the converging and diverging wedges induces a poiseuille - like contribution to the entrainment flow , superimposed on a couette - type shearing motion .",
    "there is a corresponding emergent pressure distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] inset ) , which supports the load . the ratio of the load to the lateral sliding force defines the friction coefficient @xmath0 .    as we shortly shall see , reynolds lubrication theory predicts @xmath0 is proportional to the _ sommerfeld number _",
    "@xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lubricant viscosity , @xmath3 is the sliding velocity , @xmath4 is a length scale characterising the curvature of the surfaces , and @xmath5 is the normal load .",
    "the overall @xmath6 behaviour is often summarised in the semi - empirical _ stribeck curve _",
    "[ fig : stribeck ] ) .",
    "note that pure hydrodynamic scaling breaks down as @xmath7 since the surfaces come more and more into close contact where ehl becomes increasingly important .",
    "this is reflected in the behaviour observed empirically in the stribeck curve . the present scaling theory should be applied , and interpreted , within this wider context .     underneath the sphere .",
    "inset : the skew - symmetric lubrication pressure distribution .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ]    -0.5 cm    before embarking on the detailed development , one further general remark should be made . in a geometry which posesses reflection symmetry , reynolds lubrication theory predicts the lubrication pressure should be skew - symmetric about the minimum gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] inset ) .",
    "therefore , the integrated lubrication pressure should vanish .",
    "in actuality it has long been recognised that some additional physics intervenes to knock down this result .",
    "for instance in the trailing edge where the lubrication pressure is sub - ambient ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] inset ) , the free surface may separate @xcite , or the fluid may cavitate @xcite .",
    "these considerations make the exact solution to the problem dependent on the nature of the additional physics .",
    "however a simple and commonly used prescription is to discard the contribution from the sub - ambient pressure region ( the so - called half - sommerfeld boundary condition @xcite ) .",
    "i shall tacitly use this assumption below .    keeping all this in mind , in the next section",
    "i shall develop the scaling theory for newtonian hydrodynamic lubrication , and in the following section i shall explore the implications for non - newtonian liquids .",
    "the gap between the lubricated surfaces , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] for example , can always be represented in the conjunction region by a parabolic profile @xmath8 in this @xmath9 is the minimum gap , @xmath10 is the radial distance from the minimum gap , and @xmath4 is a measure of the radius of curvature of the surfaces ( _ e.g. _  the sphere radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "the radius within which @xmath11 remains of order @xmath9 defines a length scale @xmath12 .",
    "this length scale sets the size of the conjunction region and is the key to the development of the scaling theory .    ]",
    "-0.5 cm    as already alluded to , and described in more detail in the appendix , mass conservation induces a poiseuille - type flow of magnitude @xmath3 superimposed on the couette - type shearing motion .",
    "the matching pressure distribution is such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is pressure gradient .",
    "hence the reynolds lubrication pressure has a magnitude @xmath15 the integrated pressure ( _ e.g. _  the unshaded area in the fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] inset ) then corresponds to a normal force @xmath16 in this i have used @xmath17 for the second step .",
    "this integrated pressure balances the load when @xmath18 , or alternatively , using eq .",
    ", when @xmath19 more careful treatments restore a prefactor to this , for example kapitza @xcite derived @xmath20 , and hamrock @xcite has @xmath21 .",
    "a point not often stressed , but which will be critical in the sequel , is that the lubricated conjunction is _ mechanically stable _ at the load balance condition . to see this",
    "suppose that the minimum gap @xmath9 has not yet taken its steady state value .",
    "the load @xmath5 presses down on the conjunction , and is opposed by the lubrication pressure which exerts a force of order @xmath22 given by eq .",
    ", which i note is a _ decreasing _ function of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore if the gap is too large , the lubrication pressure does not support the load and the gap closes .",
    "conversely , if the gap is too small , the lubrication pressure overcompensates for the load and the gap opens up .",
    "this stabilising mechanism is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : load ] , where the solid line is the normal force arising from the lubrication pressure . in the language of dynamical systems",
    "theory , the filled circle in this diagram is a",
    "_ stable fixed point_.    ]    -0.5 cm    i turn now to the stribeck curve .",
    "the tangential wall stress in the conjunction zone is of order @xmath23 ( see appendix ) .",
    "multiplying by the area of the conjunction ( @xmath24 ) gives the tangential force @xmath25 .",
    "hence the friction coefficient @xmath26 ( using the geometrical condition @xmath27 ) .",
    "this explains why @xmath28 in the hydrodynamic part of the stribeck curve .",

    "i.@xmath29e . _",
    "@xmath30 from eq .  .",
    "eventually the gap becomes very small and the friction coefficient deviates from the pure hydrodynamic law at the point where one enters the ehl regime @xcite .    ]",
    "i now propose the obvious extensions of the above scaling arguments to incorporate non - linear rheological effects of interest for non - newtonian lubricants . for",
    "the time being i shall leave aside the question of normal stress , flow transience , and extensional flow , and focus first on the typical shear thinning behaviour found in structured liquids .",

    "_  @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the low shear viscosity ( first newtonian plateau ) , @xmath33 is the shear rate , @xmath34 is a characteristic relaxation time , and @xmath35 is an exponent characterising the rate of decrease of the viscosity in the shear - thinning regime .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath36 is the _ weissenberg number _ and is a measure of the extent to which the non - linear regime has been penetrated . for concreteness ,",
    "a typical value of the exponent for polymer melt rheology is @xmath371 @xcite , although i should note that @xmath38 would correspond to shear banding .",
    ".   omits the second newtonian plateau which is expected to obtain at very high shear rates ; this will be added informally to the discussion at the end .    ]",
    "-0.5 cm    inserting eq .   into eq .",
    "gives a revised estimate for the normal force produced by the lubrication pressure , @xmath39 where the shear rate is estimated by @xmath40 .",
    "the perhaps nave  and rather drastic assumptions being made here will be reviewed later . since the shear rate is a decreasing function of the minimum gap , there are two regimes . for large gap ,",
    "the weissenberg number is small ( @xmath41 ) and one recovers the newtonian behaviour seen already , with @xmath42 being the viscosity in the first newtonian plateau .",
    "for small gap , one enters the high weissenberg number regime ( @xmath43 ) in which case eq .",
    "becomes @xmath44 only the @xmath9-dependence has been retained in the final step .",
    "if @xmath45 ( weak shear thinning ) , then eq .",
    "is a decreasing function of @xmath9 and one would again expect the gap to be mechanically stable , albeit with a dependence on a modified or instantaneous sommerfeld number . on the other hand , if @xmath46 ( strong shear thinning ) , @xmath22 in eq .",
    "is an _ increasing _ function of @xmath9 and therefore the load balance in this regime will be _ unstable_.    i shall take this latter case ( strong shear thinning ) to be the one of most interest ( for polymer melts , for instance ) .",
    "the two regimes in the load balance are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonl]a .",
    "the left hand branch is the high weissenberg number regime where shear thinning takes place . in this branch",
    ", the open circle corresponds to an unstable fixed point at load @xmath47 . to the left of the open circle ,",
    "the lubrication pressure is insufficient to support the load and the gap closes until interrupted by some additional physics . to the right of the open circle , the lubrication pressure forces the surfaces to move apart until one reaches the stable fixed point ( filled circle ) in the low weissenberg number regime .",
    "now consider increasing the load to @xmath48 .",
    "in this situation , the lubrication pressure is _ never _ sufficient to keep the surfaces apart and the gap closes until one enters the mixed or boundary layer lubrication regime .",
    "somewhere in between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a critical load at which the stable and unstable fixed points merge in a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the implication for the stribeck curve is as follows . in the low weissenberg number regime ,",
    "the analysis goes through as for the newtonian case , with @xmath32 featuring as the viscosity .",
    "the weissenberg number @xmath49 , and increases as the sommerfeld number shrinks .",
    "mechanical stability is lost at the point where one enters the shear thinning regime ( _ i.@xmath29e . _  at the above saddle - node bifurcation ) . at this point",
    "the surfaces should jump into ( near ) contact .",
    "correspondingly the stribeck curve should show a discontinuous jump , most likely into a boundary lubrication regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nonl]b ) .",
    "if one envisages that a second newtonian plateau appears at very high shear rates , then a restabilisation mechanism emerges naturally .",
    "in this situation , the expected behaviour of the lubrication pressure is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hyst]a .",
    "consider increasing the load , starting from a small value .",
    "at first one follows the right hand branch of the pressure curve , until stability is lost at the upper saddle - node bifurcation and the system jumps onto the left hand branch . subsequently decreasing",
    "the load reverses the process , except that the jump back occurs at the lower saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "the corresponding stribeck curve displays _ hysteresis _ and can be constructed by noting that the stable fixed points lie on branches of the lubrication pressure curve where the flow is newtonian .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyst]b .",
    "let me now consider some of the other non - linear rheological effects that might be relevant for non - newtonian lubricants .",
    "a long standing question which can be addressed in the context of the scaling theory is the rle  of normal stress .",
    "again , a simple model capturing this is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a normal stress coefficient and @xmath52 is another exponent . for concreteness ,",
    "a typical value of this exponent is @xmath531.5 for polymer melts @xcite .",
    "the contribution that normal stress makes to the load balance can be found by multiplying by the area of the conjunction , @xmath27 .",
    "alternatively we can just compare the normal stress with the reynolds lubrication pressure . in the low weissenberg number regime ( @xmath41 )",
    "the ratio of these two is @xmath54 where the pressure has been taken from eq .",
    ", and @xmath55 and @xmath51 have been substituted in the final step .",
    "the last factor @xmath56 is expected to be a small number ( _ e.g. _  @xmath57 , say ) , so the ratio @xmath58 is expected to remain small in the @xmath41 regime . in particular normal stress should not affect the situation in the stable lubrication flow up until the loss of stability at the saddle - node bifurcation in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonl ] . therefore the overall picture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonl ] remains unchanged .    in the high weissenberg number regime ( @xmath43 )",
    "one has @xmath59 . as long as @xmath60 ( which is the case for polymer melts ) , this is an increasing function of @xmath9 , and the gap remains mechanically unstable in this regime . only if @xmath61 will normal stress rescue the conjunction from complete mechanical collapse by providing enough normal force to support the load in a stable sliding configuration .",
    "however the above argument shows this should not happen until well into the non - linear regime .",
    "another factor that can be considered is that the flow is transient on a time scale of order the transit time @xmath62 .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath63 is known as the _ deborah number _ , and its magnitude gives an indication of the importance of transient flow effects , such as stress overshoot . substituting @xmath55 shows that the deborah number is of the order @xmath64 .",
    "this is the same as the ratio @xmath58 for the normal stress above , and the same argument goes through so that the overall picture remains unchanged .",
    "like normal stress , it is possible that transient flow effects may grow to become significant in the non - linear regime since the deborah number scales as @xmath65 .",
    "hence this may provide another mechanism to re - stabilise the gap at a smaller distance .      in the appendix ,",
    "the ratio of the extension to the shear components in the lubrication flow is estimated to be of the order @xmath66 .",
    "this is the same small number encountered above , and here should be compared to the _ trouton ratio _ ( _ i.@xmath29e .",
    "_  between extensional and shear viscosity ) .",
    "for example , for polymer melts the trouton ratio is of the order 3 in the low weissenberg number regime ( where the gap is stable ) , and does not increase much in the non - linear regime @xcite . on these grounds",
    "one would not expect extensional viscosity to affect the friction curve , but the situation may have to be re - evaluated if the trouton ratio is large .",
    "the main result is that hydrodynamic lubrication by non - newtonian liquids which exhibit strong shear thinning , in the sense that @xmath67 with @xmath46 , is predicted to become mechanically unstable as the shear thinning regime is entered , with the surfaces closing to near contact .",
    "this would be marked by a discontinuous jump in the stribeck ( friction ) curve as the load is increased ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nonl]b ) .",
    "non - linear effects such as normal stress and flow transience are estimated to be subdominant at the point of entry into the non - linear regime , so it is unlikely they would destroy the basic picture although they may provide stabilising mechanisms at high shear rates .",
    "extensional viscosity is also estimated to be insignificant unless the trouton ratio is large ( say , @xmath68 ) . depending on the nature of the restabilising mechanism at small gaps , the stribeck curve may show hysteresis ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hyst]b ) .",
    "these results were established on the basis of a scaling analysis which involves perhaps nave  and rather drastic assumptions .",
    "for example , the lubrication flow is assumed to remain essentially the same as in the newtonian case , but with a substituted shear - rate dependent viscosity @xmath69 .",
    "if this breaks down the analysis would be invalid .",
    "furthermore , in eqs .   and , very simple models were taken for the shear viscosity and normal stress as a function of shear rate , and additivity of the normal stress and lubrication pressure was assumed .",
    "there are certainly available much more sophisticated ( tensor ) constitutive models , such as the rolie - poly equation for polymer melts @xcite . a major and important avenue for further work is to investigate the properties of reynolds lubrication flow using these constitutive models .",
    "the possible hysteresis in the stribeck curve makes an interesting connection with recent theories of the microscopic origins of shear thickening in non - brownian suspensions @xcite . in these theories",
    "the shear thickening transition is associated with a ` breakthrough ' to frictional contacts , and indeed the simulations in fernandez _",
    "_  @xcite are based on a discontinuous friction curve of exactly the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonl]b . of course",
    ", the non - brownian particles that show the phenomenon are more typically suspended in a newtonian solvent , and not a structured liquid , and therefore one can question the relevance of the present analysis .",
    "nevertheless , experimental systems are often prepared with polymer additives ( as in ref .  ) , and as such they may perhaps exhibit non - linear frictional behaviour of the kind described here if significant polymer adsorption occurs .",
    "i thank m.  j.  adams and s.  a.  johnson for useful discussions .",
    "lubrication flow is a superimposition of couette and poiseuille contributions . for a conjunction between non - conformal surfaces , such as that shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : geom ] , the full solution requires numerics @xcite but basic insights can be gained by considering the quasi - one - dimensional case @xcite . in that case",
    "the flow is @xmath70 here @xmath71 ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xmath10 ) measures the distance along the gap , @xmath72 measures the distance from the lower surface ( moving at velocity @xmath73 ) , @xmath11 is the gap , @xmath74 is the lubrication pressure , and @xmath2 the viscosity .",
    "this velocity field corresponds to a net material flux @xmath75 this has to be constant even though @xmath11 varies , and is of order @xmath76 .",
    "the implication is that @xmath77 , which gives an order of magnitude estimate of the pressure gradient .",
    "the associated poiseuille flow velocity ( along the centerline for instance ) is then @xmath78 , as utilised in the main discussion .      the flow field in eq .",
    "is predominantly in the longitudinal direction .",
    "differentiating with respect to this direction yields an estimate for the extensional component .",
    "this yields a number of terms , all of which are of the order @xmath81 . since @xmath82 ( _ cf . _",
    "eq .  ) , one has @xmath83 , and setting @xmath84 and @xmath85 gives @xmath86 for the magnitude of the extensional flow component .",
    "this agrees with the simple picture that entrainment involves of the order 100% extensional strain , in a distance of the order @xmath87 , on a time scale of the order the transit time @xmath88 .",
    "hence the extensional strain rate @xmath89 .",
