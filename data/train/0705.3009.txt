    "however , all of these works assumed that the sharp variation in the structure under investigation was located far from the turning points of the oscillation modes , i.e. , well within their propagation cavities .",

    "based on an analysis of the results obtained from simulated data , the authors suggested a diagnostic tool to estimate the masses of the convective cores and the stellar ages . while recognizing the importance of studying simulated data , the chances of constructing the optimal diagnostic tool to detect and characterize small convective cores may be greater if we know what signal to expect .",
    "moreover , a theoretical understanding of the expected signal can provide us with a direct link between the structure under investigation and the observations  moving us toward our goal of finding the best way to infer information about that structure . with this in mind , in this paper we derive the expected signal of a small convective core on the oscillation frequencies of solar - like pulsators . unlike @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",

    "when deriving eq .",
    "( [ dw2 ] ) we assumed that our model differs from a smooth model only at the edge of the convective core . however , sharp variations in the internal structure of a star are known to occur also at other locations , such as the base of the outer convective region and the region of helium ionization .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "thus , to isolate the signal produced by the edge of a convective core , we must combine the oscillation frequencies of real stars in such a way as to cancel out , as much as possible , the signal coming from all other sources . with this in mind",

    "might be expected to affect primarily the frequencies of radial modes .",
    "this is not to say that the frequencies of modes of degree @xmath79 , which also propagate to very deep layers , will not be affected at all by the convective core .",
    "in fact , to correctly derive the expected signal for a dipolar mode , the cowling approximation should be avoided .",
    "the derivation should then be started from the formalism recently presented by @xcite , which shows that the inner turning point of dipolar modes is modified when the equations are treated without neglecting the perturbation to the gravitational potential .",
    "however , such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "hence , based on the idea that radial modes are most sensitive to the deepest layers of a star , we will proceed by assuming @xmath80 for modes with @xmath3 .",
    "this assumption will be tested in the following section . moreover , given that we are interested in modes with degree @xmath81 , we neglect the weak dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath73 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , we proceed by subtracting eq .",
    "( [ ss13 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ ss02 ] ) to find the relation @xmath88 note that for the large separations appearing in the denominators , we used pairs of modes that encompass the frequency range of the modes used in the scaled small separations , which appear in the numerators . when defined in this way , the frequency differences presented in eq .",

    "once observations with the necessary precision become available .",

    "we fixed the mixing - length parameter at @xmath95 and included core overshoot using @xmath96 with complete mixing in the overshoot region and considering the associated changes to the adiabatic temperature gradient .",
    "for each selected model , we calculated the radial and non - radial p - mode frequencies for oscillations with spherical degree @xmath73=0 - 3 and radial order @xmath72=1@xmath130 .",
    "we used these frequencies to construct the combinations shown in eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) , and compared them to the theoretical predictions .",
    "a number of approximations were made when deriving the diagnostic tool proposed in eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) .",
    "thus , it is essential that we evaluate the ability of this seismic tool when it comes to isolating the signal from the convective core .    with this in mind , we start by testing the last assumption made when deriving eq .",
    "( [ signal])namely , the weak dependence of the value of @xmath97 in the unperturbed model on the pair of modes considered . to this end , we compute eigenfrequencies for our youngest model . at an age of 0.25",

    "we expect @xmath98 . consequently , if the quantity @xmath97 were strictly independent of the pair of modes considered , the frequency differences defined by the expression on the left hand side ( lhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) would be approximately zero for all frequencies .",
    "figure  [ difnocc ] shows the frequency differences obtained for our youngest model .",
    "clearly , in the lower frequency domain the frequency differences deviate significantly from zero .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath97 is nearly independent of the pair of modes considered only in the high - frequency asymptotic regime . at lower frequencies this assumption breaks down , and",
    "consequently so does the approximation made when deriving eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) from eqs .",
    "( [ ss02 ] ) and ( [ ss13 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , at high frequencies ( @xmath99  mhz in figure  [ difnocc ] ) the frequency differences converge to a constant small value , which we shall designate @xmath100 , confirming our assumption of the near degeneracy of @xmath97 with respect to the pairs of modes @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    to compare these results with those obtained for older models , we determine the frequency differences defined by the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) for our sequence of models , with ages ranging from 0.25  gyr to 5.25  gyr .",
    "the results are shown in the left panel of figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "it is clear from this figure that in the high - frequency domain , where eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) is expected to be valid , the absolute value of the slope of the frequency differences increases with age .",
    "this can be understood as a direct consequence of the increase with age of the sound speed discontinuity at the edge of the convective core . according to eq .",
    "( [ dw2 ] ) , such an increase manifests itself through the amplitude @xmath67 by an increase in the absolute value of the frequency perturbation at fixed frequency .",
    "this increase is consequently reflected in the frequency differences defined by the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) , and thus in the slope of the curves plotted in figure  [ comparison ] .    to determine",
    "whether the signature of the convective core on the frequency differences might be detected in future observations of solar - like pulsators , we have included for one of our models the expected 1@xmath101 error bars for the frequency differences , calculated with the assumption that the relative error on the individual frequencies is 10@xmath102 ( e.g. , 0.2  @xmath2hz at 2  mhz as expected from corot ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is evident from the figure that if individual frequencies are indeed determined with such precision , we will be able to not only detect the effect of the convective core on the frequencies , but also distinguish between different possible models based on this signature .",
    "moreover , we see that our ability to detect this signature in real data will depend on the number of radial modes detected , as well as on their radial order .",
    "we made additional assumptions , other than the one referred to at the beginning of this section , while deriving eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) .",
    "in particular , we assumed that the effect of the convective core on the frequencies of modes with degree @xmath103 is negligible , when compared to the effect on the frequencies of radial modes . to check whether this assumption is valid",
    ", we compare the frequency differences calculated for a subset of our models with the theoretical expectations derived from eq .",
    "( [ dw2 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in the right panel of figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "we see from the figure that in the high - frequency asymptotic regime the theoretical signal derived from the analysis of the wave equation near the inner turning point is indeed isolated when the oscillation frequencies are combined in the way suggested by eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) .",
    "we note that there is no model dependent free parameter in the theoretical expression for the frequency perturbations .",
    "the difference in the slopes of the theoretical curves at high - frequency , seen also in the frequency differences calculated from simulated data , is thus a direct consequence of the dependence of the amplitude @xmath67 on the increase in the sound speed at the edge of the convective core .",
    "in contrast to these results , figure  [ comparison ] shows that in the low - frequency domain the combination of frequencies suggested by eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) does not properly isolate the theoretical signature expected from eq .",
    "( [ dw2 ] ) . just as in the case",
    "discussed for figure  [ difnocc ] , this is likely a consequence of the breakdown at low frequencies of the assumption that @xmath97 is independent of the pair of modes considered .",
    "according to figure  [ difnocc ] , when the frequency perturbation associated with the convective core is negligible , the frequency differences become negative in the low - frequency domain , decreasing as the frequency decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequency perturbation associated with the convective core becomes positive for frequencies below a particular value  namely , the frequency at which the position of the discontinuity in the sound speed coincides with the inner turning point of eq .",
    "( [ waveeq ] ) . in the low - frequency domain",
    ", we thus expect our diagnostic tool to show a superposition of these two behaviors .",
    "indeed , this is seen for frequencies smaller than @xmath11.5  mhz in the left panel of figure  [ comparison ] . the competition between these two behaviors results in the presence of a maximum in the frequency differences calculated for each model .      the validation of the diagnostic tool proposed in eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) in the high - frequency domain makes us confident that we understand the origin of the signature observed in the simulated data , and that we can use this signature to extract information about the convective core . as mentioned in  [ theory ] and  [ tests ] , information about the size of the sound speed discontinuity at the edge of the convective core can be extracted from the amplitude of the signal , and in principle information about the ratio @xmath104_{\\rm edge}$ ] at the edge of the convective core can be extracted from the value of the frequency at which the frequency perturbation goes through zero .",
    "moreover , given the age dependence of the size of the sound speed discontinuity at the edge of the core , the signature discussed above might also be used to infer the evolutionary status of pulsating stars within the region of the h - r diagram considered here .",
    "these ideas are illustrated in figure  [ slope ] . in the left panel",
    "the quantity @xmath105 , defined as the difference between the frequency differences @xmath106 of modes with radial orders @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with @xmath109 such that @xmath110  @xmath2hz for each model , is shown as a function of the relative increase in the squared sound speed at the edge of the convective core .",
    "the quantity @xmath105 provides a measure of the slope of the frequency difference curves , such as those plotted in the left panel of figure  [ comparison ] , in the high - frequency domain .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ slope ] that a linear relation exists between @xmath105 and the squared sound speed increase at the edge of the convective core .",
    "we also considered alternative quantities indicative of the slope of the same curves taken at constant radial order rather than at constant frequency .",
    "in all cases the results indicate a linear relation with the squared sound speed increase at the edge of the convective core .",
    "note that when studying data with noise , the use of the quantity @xmath105 defined by only two data points is not advisable .",
    "instead , it would be more convenient to extract the slope of the frequency difference curves in the high - frequency domain through a least - squares fit to the appropriate part of the curve under consideration .    since the proposed diagnostic tool fails to reproduce the theoretical signal in the low - frequency domain , the idea of using this tool to determine the value of the frequency at which the frequency perturbation associated with the convective core goes through zero  and thus extracting information about the physical size of the core  becomes compromised",
    "nevertheless , since the maxima that characterize the curves defined by the frequency differences are a consequence of the positive frequency perturbations in the low - frequency domain , we might expect the position of these maxima to contain information about the size of the convective core . with this in mind",
    ", we have determined for each model the frequency @xmath111 at which the frequency differences defined by the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ signal ] ) reach their maximum value .",
    "these are plotted as a function of age in the right panel of figure  [ slope ] , and are compared with the frequencies @xmath112_{\\rm   edge}$ ] at which the frequency perturbation associated with the convective core goes through zero .",
    "clearly , the frequency at which the frequency differences reach their maxima , indicated by the crosses in figure  [ slope ] , is strongly correlated with the age of the model .",
    "this is not surprising since the magnitudes of the frequency perturbations , which influence the position of the maxima , are also correlated with age .",
    "nevertheless , a change in the slope is noticeable around an age of @xmath14  gyr .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the contracting core .",
    "as seen in figure  [ sspeed ] , when the core begins to contract , the sound speed variation near the edge of the convective core begins to spread over a larger radial extent .",
    "our theoretical analysis , which assumes that the sound speed variation at the edge of the core is well represented by a modified step function , becomes less adequate in this case .",
    "nevertheless , an inspection of the frequency differences shown in the left panel of figure  [ comparison ] indicates that in the older models where this effect becomes evident , the amplitude of the frequency differences in the low - frequency domain is indeed substantially larger than in all other models .",
    "this may result from a sudden increase in the amplitude of the frequency perturbation in the low - frequency domain , or from an improvement in the degeneracy of @xmath97 calculated for pairs of modes with degrees @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "whatever the case , the relative importance of the latter in determining the functional form of the frequency differences appears to be smaller for models with ages greater than @xmath14  gyr .",
    "thus , one might expect that for these models the frequency @xmath112_{\\rm edge}$ ] will be better estimated by the frequency @xmath113 at which the frequency differences cross the asymptotic value for the youngest model in figure  [ difnocc ] .",
    "indeed this seems to be the case , as shown by the diamonds in the right panel of figure  [ slope ] .",
    "we have derived the expected signature of small convective cores on the oscillation frequencies of solar - like pulsators , we have suggested a diagnostic tool to isolate this signature , and finally we have discussed what information the signature may reveal about the convective cores themselves and about the evolutionary status of the corresponding stars .",
    "the results demonstrate that our ability to isolate the convective core signature with the suggested diagnostic tool is significantly better in the high - frequency asymptotic domain than at lower frequencies .",
    "consequently , the information inferred from this diagnostic tool at high frequencies is expected to be more robust . in particular , this is the case for the relation found between the slope of the frequency difference curves and the relative increase in the squared sound speed at the edge of the convective core .",
    "based on the theoretical signal , which in the high - frequency domain is well represented by the proposed diagnostic tool , we expect this relation to hold also in a more general context when models of different mass , chemical composition , or with different amounts of core overshoot are considered .",
    "by contrast , information inferred from the behaviour of the diagnostic tool at lower frequencies , such as the estimation of the ratio @xmath104_{\\rm   edge}$ ] from the position of the maximum in the frequency differences , or from the value of the frequency at which these differences cross @xmath114 , is likely to show a stronger model dependence . as emphasized earlier , at lower frequencies the functional form of the diagnostic tool is influenced by the deviation from degeneracy of the quantity @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , this tool does not capture , as well as it does at higher frequencies , the effect of the convective core on the oscillations , even though it is still influenced by it .",
    "therefore , it is important to extend the present study to different models , varying quantities such as mass , chemical composition , and core overshoot , to determine the extent to which the quantities studied  particularly in the low - frequency domain ",
    "depend on the properties of the models .",
    "one aspect of major importance that has been considered by most works involving diagnostic tools to study the inner regions of stars is the ability of these tools to determine the stellar age .",
    "the correlations between the quantities studied in  [ data ] and the age of the models are clear . hence , in principle the former might be used to infer the evolutionary status of pulsating stars .",
    "in fact , this correlation is responsible for the one found by @xcite between their quantity @xmath115 and the central hydrogen abundance @xmath116 , ( cf .",
    "figure 7 of their paper ) .",
    "their @xmath115 is proportional to the difference @xmath117 averaged over several radial orders @xmath72 , and through @xmath116 it reflects the change in the slope seen in the left panel of our figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "thus , our analysis also provides the theoretical basis for the correlation found by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to investigate how these correlations depend on other stellar parameters , and to ascertain whether there are degeneracies in the age determination when the appropriate parameter space is explored .",
    "also , as mentioned in   [ models ] , the models used to test our diagnostic tool did not include diffusion .",
    "the presence of diffusion will likely result in a smoother transition in @xmath118 .",
    "we hope to tackle the consequences of including diffusion in future work .",
    "asteroseismic data with the precision necessary to test our diagnostic tool observationally are soon expected from the corot satellite @xcite .",
    "the second scheduled 5-month run will include the star hd  49933 , which exhibits solar - like oscillations @xcite and has approximately the required mass and age to reveal the expected signal .",
    "future observations of the slightly more massive spectroscopic binary star 12  botis @xcite could also provide an interesting test of our predictions .",
