    "higgs search is one of the main goals of the present and future colliders . specially ,",
    "in the case o fthe extensions of the sm such as mssm or nmssm , there are several higgs particles whose detection in the colliders is an important issue .",
    "usually gauge and yukawa couplings and particle masses are unknown , and thus the predictive power of such models is limited .",
    "thus , one has to analyze different models to find bounds as model independent as possible .    in this note",
    "we shall analyze the indications of higgs scalars in as specific @xmath3 scattering process in an abelian extended supersymmetric sm .",
    "implications of extra @xmath4 bosons appearing in such gauge extensions of sm by an extra @xmath5 have been widely analyzed and checked against the precison data , and in the context of the future colliders @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall analyze @xmath6 cross section in a @xmath5 extended supersymmetric sm .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 may remind one the recent aleph four - jet anomaly @xcite . however , higgs interpretation is not appropriate to explain the four - jet topology there @xcite . for a supersymmetrical interpretation of this event one can refer , for example , to @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here is based upon the recent work @xcite .",
    "the model under concern is analyzed in detail together with the rge analysis of the parameters of the potential in @xcite . there",
    "the low energy model we discuss is obtained from a supergravity lagrangian with appropriate non - universality in the soft masses at the string scale .",
    "here we consider simply a low energy model and summarize some relevant results of @xcite and derive the necessary quantities for the present problem .",
    "in particular , we shall work in the trilinear coupling - driven minimum of the potential which is discussed in section 3 and section 5 of @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall review the main results of @xcite relevant for this work , and derive the necessary quantities for the problem in hand .    in sec .",
    "3 we shall derive @xmath8 cross section by using resonance approximation for the scalars .",
    "we shall base our analysis mainly on the analytical results instead of using computer codes such as phytia or jetset as it was done in @xcite .",
    "we will evaluate the cross section and present the variation of the cross section against the center of mass energy and higgs yukawa coupling .",
    "finally in section 4 , a discussion on the results and their implications are given .",
    "we will first summarize some of the results of @xcite , and derive the necessary quantities for the present problem .",
    "the gauge group is extended to @xmath9 with the respective couplings @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we introduce the higgs fields @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , with the indicated quantum numbers under @xmath17 .",
    "the gauge invariance of the superpotential @xmath18 guarantees that @xmath19 .",
    "the scalar potential is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 . here the soft mass parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 can have either sign , and without loss of generality we choose @xmath25 positive . in terms of the real fields @xmath26 the higgs fields are defined by @xmath27 here @xmath28 determines the charged higgs sector .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 being real , there is no cp violation at the tree level so that the neutral sector of the total scalar mass matrix is split into cp - even and cp - odd parts . in that minimum of the potential for which gauge group is completely broken down to color and electric symmetries the mass - squared matrices of cp-",
    "even and cp - odd scalars become , respectively @xmath32 in @xmath33 basis , and @xmath34 in @xmath35 basis . here",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath41 yields three cp - even scalars @xmath42 the diagonalization of @xmath43 yields two cp- odd goldstone bosons and a pseudoscalar boson @xmath44    there are two neutral vector bosons : @xmath4 boson of @xmath45 and @xmath2 boson of @xmath46 which mix through the mass - squared matrix @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath1 mixing angle @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 the coupling of neutral vector bosons to @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be calculated straightforwardly : @xmath54 moreover , the @xmath55 and @xmath56 vertices are given by @xmath57",
    "we shall calculate the cross section for each possible cp - even neutral particle.the scattering process under concern involves four particles in the final state .",
    "thus , the phase space integration is too complicated to be carried out analytically .",
    "we shall calculate the total cross section by replacing the @xmath52 and @xmath53 lines with resonances : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the total widths of @xmath53 and @xmath52 . under this approximation",
    "one can now calculate the total cross section analitycally , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the phase space factor coming from @xmath63 decay .",
    "the vector and axial couplings are defined by @xmath64 here the coefficients @xmath65 include the vector boson propagators and couplings of the vector bosons to scalars @xmath66 where , using ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we defined @xmath67 via @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 in ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) are given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 being the @xmath46 charges of lepton doublet @xmath75 and lepton singlet @xmath76 .",
    "the minimization of the potential in ( [ pot ] ) should be done such that the mixing angle ( [ mixing ] ) should be below the phenomenological bound @xmath77 .",
    "next , if @xmath2 boson is to have an effect on this scattering process its mass should be under lep2 or lhc reach .",
    "these two constraints can be met under the following conditions :    * if the trilinear coupling @xmath25 is large compared to the soft mass parameters then potential is minimized for @xmath78 * and , if @xmath46 charges of higgs doublets satisfy @xmath79 so that @xmath80 , consequently @xmath1 mixing angle becomes small without a large @xmath31 .",
    "this yields a vanishingly small @xmath1 mixing angle and a relatively light @xmath81 .",
    "in using this procedure we assume that the absolute minimum of the potential does not occur in the sfermion sector , which otherwise breaks the color and charge symmetries . in this large trilinear coupling limit one",
    "has definite predictions for the scalar and vector boson masses independent of the sign and magnitude of the soft masses in ( [ pot ] ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 , and the mass spectrum obeys the ordering @xmath84 , for @xmath85 .    for any value of the yukawa coupling @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "this sets an ever- existing gap between the masses of the lightest higgs @xmath88 and the pseudoscalar @xmath53 .    in the minimum of the potential under concern , the matrices @xmath89 in ( [ r ] ) and @xmath90 in ( [ f ] ) become @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the would - be pseudoscalar goldstone bosons .",
    "since @xmath95 and @xmath96 are identical , one has from ( [ zha1 ] ) and ( [ zha2 ] ) , @xmath97    using @xmath98 and @xmath95 one gets @xmath99 where in demonstrating that @xmath100 vanishes , we used the equality of the @xmath46 charges of the doublets .",
    "finally , using @xmath101 and @xmath95 one gets @xmath102 which reflect completely the extended nature of the model .",
    "now we shall discuss the implications of the vector boson - higgs couplings in ( 44)-(49 ) .",
    "as is seen from ( 44 ) and ( 45 ) there is no coupling of vector bosons to the lightest higgs scalar and the pseudoscalar boson .",
    "these two equations guarantee that the @xmath46 extended model under concern behaves very much like the sm in the large trilinear coupling driven minimum . in particular , ( 44 ) is a reminder of the sm where there is no pseudoscalar boson at all .",
    "as dictated by ( 45 ) , in this minimum of the potential @xmath81 is also similar to @xmath4 in this respect .",
    "this vanishing of the coupling constants is important in that @xmath88 does not contribute to the total cross section .",
    "the coupling of the vector bosons to next - to - lightest higgs @xmath103 and @xmath53 are given by ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) . as is seen from ( 46 ) @xmath104 now feels @xmath103 and @xmath53 by a non - zero coupling constant @xmath105 .",
    "as we require the mixing angle be small ( @xmath106 ) this coupling constant is no way negligable in the minimum of the potential under concern .",
    "the nature of the coupling is essentially weak , since extended nature of the model enters ony by the @xmath1 mixing angle .",
    "the coupling of the vector bosons to heaviest higgs @xmath107 and pseudoscalar @xmath53 are given by ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) .",
    "in this case both @xmath104 and @xmath81 couple to scalars .",
    "it is for @xmath107 case that the couplings carry the seeds of the extended nature of the model .",
    "strengths of the couplings are proportional to the @xmath46 coupling constant times the @xmath46 charge of the singlet @xmath108 .",
    "unless @xmath109 is unnaturally large as compared to the moderate choice @xmath110 , in the small @xmath1 mixing angle limit @xmath104 essentially decouples from scalars leaving room only for @xmath81 .    a number of authors have explained a possible excess in @xmath111 by a leptophobic @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the most recent lep data @xcite weakened the possibility of an @xmath111 excess .",
    "so @xmath2 , if exists , would probably be hadrophobic .",
    "thus we are to take @xmath2 as leptophobic as possibile as required by the present data .",
    "we can summarize the situation concerning the process under consideration ( under the resonance approximation ) as follows .",
    "@xmath88 is excluded from the process by ( 44 ) and ( 45 ) and , consequently it brings no constraint on yukawa and gauge couplings . as we see from ( 46)-(49 ) , @xmath81 does not contribute to the scattering process until @xmath112 exceeds the kinematical threshold @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 is bounded by @xmath115 from below , and the latter depends on the @xmath46 coupling constant and @xmath46 charge of the singlet @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath115 is beyond the lep2 reach so does @xmath114 .",
    "the axial and vector couplings of the vector bosons are given in ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) . from these equations , and from ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) , it follows that @xmath116 in the case of small @xmath1 mixing angle , which is really the case in the minimum of the potential , @xmath46 contribution to vector and axial couplings of leptons is suppressed by @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the vector and axial couplings in ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) practically do not get any significant contribution from leptonic @xmath46 charges ; @xmath118 for moderate values of @xmath109 , ( @xmath110 ) , in the small @xmath1 mixing angle limit , one can neglect coupling of @xmath104 to @xmath107 and @xmath53 in ( 48 ) . then @xmath81 couples to scalars by a non negligable coupling constant @xmath119 , as is seen from ( 49 ) . under this approximation ,",
    "the leptonic couplings are given by @xmath120 which can be large enough to make @xmath81 effects be seen in the present - day experiments .",
    "altough it was not the case in the @xmath88 and @xmath103 couplings , here one has to choose @xmath2 as leptophobic as required by the experiment . from the form of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 given in ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) , we conclude that @xmath46 charges of both @xmath75 and @xmath76 must be choosen small .",
    "this makes @xmath81 to be hardly observable .    depending on the leptophobicity of @xmath2 to suppress the vector and axial couplings in ( 54 ) and ( 55 ) , one concludes that only @xmath103 gives a significant contribution to the total cross section through ( 46 ) .",
    "this is an important result in that one can single out the next - to - lightest higgs among others by measuring the cross section .",
    "reading @xmath123 and @xmath124 from ( 36 ) and ( 38 ) , and using ( 52 ) and ( 53 ) we can rewrite the total cross section as follows @xmath125 where we introduced the definitions @xmath126 and effective @xmath127 parameter is defined by @xmath128 .",
    "thus , cross section depends on two variables only : @xmath129 and @xmath130 , in particular , it does not depend upon the @xmath46 coupling constant and @xmath46 charges of leptons and higgs fields .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the dependence of the cross section @xmath131 on the @xmath132 and @xmath133 for particular values of the branching ratios @xmath134 and @xmath135 . when the scalars are heavy enough the dominant decay mode is @xmath136 ( including the gluonic final states ) .",
    "under the present lower bounds on the scalar masses ( which are mostly model dependent ) @xmath137 dominance is guaranteed so that small @xmath130 portion of fig .",
    "1 is irrelevant .    in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath133 is allowed to vary from 0.15 @xmath138 to 0.5 @xmath139 . at the latter end ,",
    "cross section is bigger due to the closeness of this end to the @xmath140 pole .",
    "as @xmath112 grows to larger values the cross section falls gradually and becomes numerically @xmath141 around @xmath142 .",
    "when @xmath112 is below the kinematical threshold of @xmath143 , @xmath144 is forbidden , and we plot in these regions @xmath145 surface to form a reference level . in an exact treatment of the process",
    ", this region would be smaller since the resonance approximation puts the restriction of reality on the scalars whereby narrowing the available phase space .",
    "as wee observe from the figure for higher values of @xmath112 the region of non - zero cross section becomes wider , making observability possible .",
    "actually , the phenomenological bounds on the pseudocalar mass must have been taken into account , however as these bounds might change , we present the plot in entire @xmath86 range to show the variation of cross section with @xmath86 and @xmath112 .",
    "let us note that , in the above discussion , we have concentrated on the coupling of the vector bosons to the cp - even and cp - odd scalars to analyze the scattering process under concern .",
    "altough this discussion is sufficient for the aim of the work , one could analyze other modes of higgs production , such as the higgs strahlung process @xcite , @xmath146 in the model under consideration . to give an idea",
    ", we shall list the @xmath147 coupling when @xmath110 and mixing angle is negligable small @xmath148 the remaining couplings are proportional to @xmath117 , and thus small compared to those in ( 60 ) , @xmath110 . as a result , coupling of @xmath149 to @xmath103 is negligably small compared to others .",
    "there is again a profound difference between @xmath103 and others .",
    "namely , unlike @xmath150 , @xmath103 shifts @xmath104 to @xmath81 and vice versa , which allows one to single out @xmath103 among others .",
    "higgs search through higgs - strahlung channel will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the mixing angle is an essential phenomenological restriction on such gauge extensions of mssm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , leptophobicity is an indispensable requirement according to lep results . under these two requirements ,",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath151 scattering in an abelian extended sm .    in the large triliear coupling limit ,",
    "model yields interesting results in that only next - to - lightest higgs contribute to the process .",
    "the @xmath2 boson is essentially unobservable as far as the leptonic current is considered . in this sense model",
    "is similar to nmssm @xcite where one extends the higgs sector with a singlet .",
    "however , determination of the parameters requires a different analysis which is outside the scope of this work .",
    "we have analyzed the present model at the tree - level . at the loop level ,",
    "behaviour of the potential , and thus , all the physical parameters derived here , including the mixing angle itself , would naturally change @xcite .",
    "strength of the variations in the potential parameters depends on the @xmath46 charges of the particle spectrum , yukawa couplings ( especially the top yukawa coupling ) , gauge couplings and soft parameters .",
    "here we limited our work to tree level analysis , leaving the consideration of the radiative corrections to another work .    in near future",
    ", lep ii , lhc or nlc may catch the signals of @xmath2 boson after which the predictions or the assumptions of this work can be tested against the experimental results .",
    "for example , after a two year run , lep ii will be able to count up to @xmath152 events depending on the lwer bound on the scalar masses ."
