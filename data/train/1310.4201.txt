    "three dimensional low - thrust optimal orbit transfer has attracted much inquiry focused on trajectory optimization using orbital elements . due to strong nonlinearity of differential equations in gaussian form with orbital elements , it is often difficult to obtain the optimal solution numerically in this system .",
    "some of the earliest works on the orbit transfer between neighboring elliptic orbits and on the transfer between coplanar and coaxial ellipses were presented by edelbaum @xcite .",
    "however , his elements as well as the keplerian elements all contain singularity .",
    "to avoid the singularity , arsenault @xcite firstly introduced the equinoctial elements .",
    "broucke and cefola @xcite developed nonsingular equinoctial orbital elements using the lagrange and poisson brackets of keplerian elements .",
    "kechichian @xcite presented an application of these nonsingular elements to solve the minimum time rendezvous problem with constant acceleration .",
    "chobotov @xcite considered more cases in minimum time transfer , including the comparison between exact solutions and approximate solutions obtained by the averaging technique .",
    "gerffroy and epenoy @xcite made further progress in both minimum time and fuel transfer problems using the averaging technique with the constraints of earth s oblateness and shadow effect taken into account .",
    "more recent works using the numerical averaging technique were presented by tarzi and speyer et al.@xcite , who provided a quick and accurate numerical approach for a wide range of transfers , including orbital perturbations such as earth s oblateness and shadow effect .",
    "besides the strong nonlinearity , an additional disadvantage in using the equinoctial elements is the complexity of the equations in this coordinate system . with this system ,",
    "kepler s equation must be solved by iteration to get the eccentric longitude at each integration step .",
    "hence , equinoctial elements present challenges for trajectory optimization .",
    "walker @xcite put forth another important development in the study of equinoctial elements when he used the stroboscopic method to modify orbital elements .",
    "he also altered differential equations into an approximative form , containing five dependent variables and one independent variable , as a means of achieving faster computation performance without solving kepler s equation .",
    "roth @xcite introduced the stroboscopic method to obtain a higher order approximation for small perturbed dynamical systems , which depends on several slow variables and one fast variable .",
    "haberkorn and gergaud @xcite investigated the application of the modified orbital elements by using the homotopy method .",
    "cui et al .",
    "@xcite used sequential quadratic programming under their lyapunov feedback control law , which was based on a function made up of modified elements , to obtain the optimal - lyapunov solution without optimal transfer .",
    "gao and li @xcite made the similar work to optimize the lyapunov function but never reached the optimal solution based on their lyapunov control law .",
    "an advanced technique using the lyapunov - based controller to solve the low - thrust orbit transfer problem in cartesian coordinates was introduced and rigorously proved by chang et al .",
    ". this technique is based on the fact that a non - degenerate keplerian orbit is uniquely described by its specific angular momentum and laplace vectors .",
    "the resulting lyapunov function provides an asymptotically stabilizing feedback controller , such that the target elliptic keplerian orbit becomes a locally asymptotically stable periodic orbit .",
    "however , the lyapunov - based transfer trajectory is not optimal in every sense . in this paper , the lyapunov - based transfer presented in @xcite",
    "shall be called chang - chichka - marsden ( ccm ) transfer to distinguish it from any other lyapunov - based transfers .",
    "the motivation behind this paper is to use the ccm transfer trajectory as an initial guess for optimization in order to obtain the optimal transfer solution utilizing cartesian coordinates . using this method avoids the numerical disadvantages due to strong nonlinearity and complexity in the use of orbital elements .",
    "this paper reviews the ccm transfer method @xcite in section 2 . in section 3 , a means to translate keplerian elements into specific angular momentum and laplace vectors",
    "is presented .",
    "section 4 presents the proposed approach and the optimality ( kkt ) conditions for the minimum fuel consumption problem in cartesian coordinates .",
    "specifically , the chebyshev - gauss pseudospectral method is introduced to illustrate how the continuous optimal control problem can be reduced to a discretized nonlinear programming problem .",
    "finally , in section 5 , numerical simulations are carried out to make detailed comparisons between the optimal results using cartesian coordinates and those using orbital elements with the same initial guess .",
    "it shows that the use of cartesian coordinates makes it easier to obtain the correct optimal solution .",
    "this section summarizes and reviews the chang - chichka - marsden ( ccm ) transfer in @xcite .",
    "this transfer employs lyapunov - based controllers to achieve asymptotically stable transfers between elliptic orbits in a two - body problem .",
    "this paper assumes that the configuration space is @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the tangent space of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 be the coordinates on @xmath4 .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath5 of which the solutions are regarded as the _ keplerian orbits _ , where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the specific energy @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 define @xmath9 by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the specific angular momentum vector and @xmath12 is the laplace vector .",
    "the laplace vector @xmath12 is related to the eccentricity vector @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 the three quantities @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfy the following two identities : @xmath16 define the sets @xmath17 the following proposition is from @xcite .    the following hold : + 1 .",
    "@xmath18 is the union of all non - degenerate elliptic keplerian orbits .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the fiber @xmath21 consists of a unique ( oriented ) non - degenerate elliptic keplerian orbit for each @xmath22 .",
    "[ prop1 ]      the equation of the motion with a specific control force is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the control force .",

    "let @xmath30 be the open ball of radius @xmath31 centered at @xmath32 in the @xmath25-metric and @xmath33 its closure .",

    "then , @xmath43 the following proposition is proven in @xcite using lasalle s invariance principle @xcite .    [ prop:2 ]",
    "let @xmath44 be the pair of the specific angular momentum and laplace vectors of the target elliptic orbit .",
    "take any closed ball @xmath45 of radius @xmath46 centered at @xmath47 contained in the set @xmath48 defined in ( [ set : d ] ) .",
    "then every trajectory starting in the subset @xmath49 of @xmath50 remains in that subset and asymptotically converges to the target elliptic orbit @xmath51 in the closed - loop dynamics ( [ eq : newton ] ) with the control law in ( [ eq : control ] )    the choice of the parameter @xmath52 in the lyapunov function @xmath35 plays a crucial role in determining the transfer trajectory @xcite .",
    "it determines the relative weighting between the two quadratic terms in the function @xmath35 in ( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) . with a small @xmath52 the shape of the trajectory will adjust to that of the target orbit first because a more weight is on @xmath53 . on the other hand , with a large @xmath52 , the normal direction of the trajectory plane will adjust to that of the target orbit plane first because a more weight is on @xmath54 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 also determines the shape of the region of attraction since @xmath52 determines the shape of the ball @xmath55 in the metric @xmath25 .",
    "additionally , the ccm transfer works well for parabolic transfer , although the success of the transfer is proven exclusively for elliptic orbits only in proposition [ prop:2 ] .",
