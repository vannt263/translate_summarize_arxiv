    "this demonstrates the fact that the rn spacetime is actually dynamic . as we advance in @xmath76 the wormhole shrinks",
    "this phenomena also occurs when advancing along the timelike kruskal - szekeres coordinate in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "while @xmath31 is reached only as @xmath77 , the surface described by @xmath73 can be treated with our working accuracy as if it is tangent to the @xmath48 hyperbola ( see figure [ fig : coosysa ] ) .",
    "the wormhole with a throat radius of @xmath31 is the narrowest wormhole that the time evolution in coordinate system a allows .",
    "this is contrary to the schwarzschild case , where the wormhole continues to shrink until it closes when reaching the singularity .    to explore further the rn spacetime",
    "we must transform to coordinate system b. horizontal lines in this coordinate system describe spacelike hypersurfaces that begin at the @xmath78 singularity and increase in radial distance until connecting with the parallel region after crossing the @xmath31 horizon .",
    "therefore the embedding diagrams of these hypersurfaces will be of a different nature . in the proximity of the @xmath78 singularity we can never embed any surface in euclidean space .",
    "the rn line element has @xmath79 and @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "every path that approaches @xmath78 will have at a sufficiently small radius @xmath82 .",
    "therefore around the singularity we must embed the following surfaces in minkowski space . at a certain distance",
    "the embedding becomes euclidean .",
    "as we examine the evolution of spacelike surfaces seen by a traveler that enters the black hole , we enter coordinate system b from the bottom and draw in figure [ fig : emb4 ] the embedding diagram of the surface described by @xmath83 .     hypersurface . for brevity",
    "the figure depicts two different surfaces that describe the embeddings of parts of this hypersurface in different background spaces .",
    "the portion described by dashed lines is embedded in minkowski space and the portion described by solid lines is embedded in euclidean space .",
    "we can see an inflection point at @xmath48 .",
    "note that the minkowski portion starts at @xmath84.,width=491 ]    the connection between the parallel regions @xmath85 occurs now when increasing the radial distance ( up to @xmath86 in the example above ) .",
    "figure [ fig : coosysb ] shows that the two inner parallel regions are `` closest '' in the surface of @xmath87 , where they touch at @xmath48 .",
    "the embedding of this surface is displayed in figure [ fig : emb5 ] .",
    "hypersurface . for brevity , here",
    "again , the figure depicts two different surfaces that describe the embeddings of parts of this hypersurface in different background spaces.,width=491 ]    it is interesting to inspect the resemblance between the geometry of the horizontal lines in coordinate system b and the geometry of the vertical lines in the kruskal - szekeres coordinates of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we can imagine a resemblance because the schwarzschild spacetime s vertical lines also emerge from the @xmath78 singularity and connect with a parallel region after crossing the horizon .",
    "however , these vertical lines describe timelike hypersurfaces and so their embeddings will all be in minkowski spaces . comparing figures [ fig : emb4],[fig : emb5 ] with figure [ fig : sch - ver ] , we indeed see some resemblance .",
    "the region near the singularity in the rn spacetime s horizontal lines has a similar general shape to the schwarzschild spacetime s vertical lines on their way from the singularity to the parallel region .",
    "the region in rn with @xmath88 continues towards the parallel region like the schwarzschild surfaces , but this region is embedded in euclidean space while the schwarzschild surfaces continue in minkowski space .",
    "we turn now to inspect timelike hypersurfaces of the rn spacetime described by vertical lines in our coordinate systems .",
    "the @xmath89 line passes in the two coordinate systems only in regions @xmath36 between @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "the embedding diagram of this surface ( in minkowski space of course ) is displayed in figure [ fig : emb6 ] .",
    "the diagram shows just one of the periodic segments of the infinite surface .",
    "the enlargement demonstrates the smoothness of the embedding at the @xmath31 wormhole throat.,width=491 ]    we can see in the figure a connection ( the timelike wormhole presented in coordinate system b ) between parallel regions at @xmath48 .",
    "additionally , we can see in coordinate system a a timelike wormhole connecting parallel regions at @xmath47 , and this should be visible in the embedding by connecting the upper and lower ends of figure [ fig : emb6 ] with identical diagrams .",
    "the complete surface is achieved by connecting an infinite chain of such diagrams .",
    "when passing through the @xmath31 horizon to a parallel region there appears to be a cusp in the embedding .",
    "this is not a consequence of performing a wrong connection between the coordinate systems , since the entire calculation here was done in a single coordinate system .",
    "however , a close inspection of the embedding function reveals that its slope is in fact continuous at @xmath48 .",
    "when approaching the wormhole throat at @xmath31 , @xmath90 diverges , as is required for a smooth connection ( see the inset in figure [ fig : emb6 ] ) .",
    "we now move the vertical line to the side ( either positive or negative @xmath91 ) and examine a hypersurface that touches the singularity at @xmath78 ( see figure [ fig : emb7 ] ) .",
    "surface.,width=491 ]    this timelike surface passes regions @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it begins by touching the @xmath78 surface , where the wormhole throat is closed .",
    "its radius increases and it crosses the @xmath31 horizon ( where the embedding seems again to break ) .",
    "it continues past the @xmath30 horizon and reaches a maximal radius where it connects to a new parallel region .",
    "the complete surface is , of course , described by an infinite chain of identical diagrams .",
    "it should be noted that at @xmath48 we were careful not to switch between coordinate systems ( we have a freedom to connect the vertical lines of the two coordinate systems somewhere between @xmath48 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "the surface is smooth at the point of the coordinate systems connection ( @xmath92 in this example ) .",
    "again , the surface is in fact also smooth at @xmath48 , as a detailed inspection of this area shows .",
    "the timelike wormhole around the singularity is widest ( the throat has a radius of @xmath31 ) for the hypersurface described by @xmath89 .",
    "this is similar to the surface described by the horizontal line @xmath93 in the kruskal - szekeres schwarzschild coordinates ( described in figure [ fig : sch - hor ] ) , where the spacelike wormhole is widest ( with a throat radius of 2 m ) .",
    "when we move in the kruskal - szekeres coordinates towards horizontal lines of larger @xmath94 , the wormhole shrinks until it closes with zero circumference at the @xmath78 singularity .",
    "this resembles our case , where moving the vertical lines towards larger @xmath91 caused the wormhole to shrink until it eventually closed at the hypersurface tangent to @xmath78 . a resemblance between the known schwarzschild embedding diagrams and the rn embedding diagrams is indeed apparent .",
    "notice again the significant difference that the relevant schwarzschild surfaces are spacelike and embedded in euclidean space , whereas our current surfaces are timelike and embedded in minkowski space .",
    "the character of the @xmath31 horizon is different than that of the schwarzschild event horizon , and this is apparent in the diagrams .",
    "in addition , the schwarzschild spacetime horizontal lines continue towards radial infinity , whereas our vertical lines cross another horizon at @xmath30 and then reach another wormhole and contract towards @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the resemblance between the schwarzschild horizontal lines and the rn vertical lines is limited to the region of coordinate system b , describing the area around the singularity and the @xmath31 horizon in the rn spacetime .",
    "the portions of the vertical lines that reside in coordinate system a ( around the @xmath30 horizon ) are in fact similar to vertical lines in the schwarzschild spacetime , as is evident by a comparison to figure [ fig : sch - ver ] .",
    "this is not surprising due to the similarity of coordinate system a to the kruskal - szekeres coordinates .",
    "we developed tools and displayed embedding diagrams of spacelike and timelike hypersurfaces of the rn spacetime .",
    "the hypersurfaces described provide a typical example of spacelike and timelike slices of the rn spacetime and demonstrate the evolution of rn surfaces .",
    "the visualization presented for these slices provides an alternative way to understand intuitively the geometry of the rn spacetime and its properties .",
    "the rn geometry is similar to the schwarzschild geometry in the region external to the event horizon @xmath68 . in accordance with this",
    "the embedding diagrams of hypersurfaces described in the coordinate system that crosses @xmath47 were similar to the embedding diagrams of the analogous schwarzschild hypersurfaces .",
    "when we advance in time to different rn spacelike slices described by horizontal lines in this coordinate system , the wormhole shrinks , as is the case when the schwarzschild spacetime evolves in the time coordinate of kruskal - szekeres .",
    "however , as expected , when we continue to advance in time and reach the hypersurfaces described in the coordinate system that crosses @xmath48 , the similarity to schwarzschild stops .",
    "the @xmath31 horizon has no analogy in the schwarzschild spacetime , and the rn horizontal lines that intersect @xmath48 exhibit a different behavior .",
    "these hypersurfaces hit on both sides the @xmath78 singularity , and their geometry near the singularity resembles the geometry of timelike schwarzschild hypersurfaces , presented as vertical kruskal - szekeres lines .",
    "finally , vertical lines in the rn coordinates describe a path through a wormhole passing beside the singularity .",
    "the geometry of the respective surfaces has some features resembling the geometry of the surfaces describing the schwarzschild wormhole , which are presented there as horizontal lines .",
    "the fundamental difference is that the schwarzschild wormhole is a spacelike path that can not be embarked upon , whereas the rn wormhole is an actual timelike path .",
    "this is reflected in the evolution of the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "when we advance in time the schwarzschild wormhole shrinks and closes .",
    "however , progressing with the rn spacelike surfaces does not cause the wormhole to close , as apparent from our embedding diagrams , and we are not forced to be drained into the singularity . instead one may choose to take a path like the ones described by our timelike embedding diagrams , and pass through the timelike wormhole to a parallel region and to infinite new universes .",
