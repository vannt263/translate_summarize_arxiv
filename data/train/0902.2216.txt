    "strongly coupled quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) poses theoretically challenging yet experimentally accessible questions .",
    "the formation of qgp at rhic is an example where theoretical descriptions are completely lacking at low energies because our perturbative techniques fail at strong couplings .",
    "however probing the nonperturbative regime of large @xmath0 gauge theory through a _ gravity _ dual has led to some interesting results for the physics of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "a popular approach so far has been the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , even though qcd is not a conformal field theory at uv .",
    "however , for certain gauge theories with running couplings , there exist gravity duals . at zero temperatures",
    "these gravity duals are studied with @xcite and without @xcite fundamental flavors . on the other hand , at high temperatures ,",
    "there are examples of gravity duals without fundamental flavors in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give an example of a gravity dual for a specific thermal gauge theory with fundamental flavors and logarithmically running coupling constants ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our aim here is to study quantities such as shear viscosity , entropy and the viscosity to entropy ratio with our gravity dual .",
    "the gauge theory that we consider arises from stacking @xmath0 d3 branes at the tip of a six dimensional conifold with base @xmath1 , then placing @xmath2 d5 branes in such a way that it wraps the two cycle @xmath3 on the base of the conifold alongwith @xmath4 @xmath5 branes embedded via so - called ouyang embedding @xcite to introduce fundamental matter @xcite . finally by euclideanising and periodically identifying the time coordinate we can introduce temperature in the gauge theory .",
    "however the high temperature , i.e temperature above the deconfinement temperature that we would be interested in , will be generated by inserting a black hole in the dual gravitational backgound @xcite .",
    "the d3 brane world volume and the unwrapped directions of d5 and d7 branes extends in the four minkowski directions .",
    "strings can end on any of these branes and the excitation of the strings are described by an @xmath6 gauge group with @xmath4 flavors . if @xmath7 denote the gauge couplings of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , then they have nontrivial beta functions ( at zero temperature ) @xmath10 =   - \\frac{3n_f}{4}$ ] and @xmath11 =   3m\\left(1 + \\frac{3g_s n_f}{2\\pi } ~{\\rm log}\\lambda\\right)$ ] .",
    "we see that the two gauge couplings run in opposite directions and in the ir @xmath8 flows to strong coupling . performing a seiberg duality transformation ,",
    "we identify the strongly coupled @xmath8 with a weakly coupled @xmath12 at the ir .",
    "we see that not only the number of colors are reduced , but the difference of the size of the gauge group now decreases from @xmath2 in @xcite to @xmath13 .",
    "this difference will decrease by the increments of @xmath4 until it is smaller than or equal to @xmath4 .",
    "then there are two possible end points : ( a ) if @xmath0 is still greater than zero then we will have an approximately conformal theory , or ( b ) if @xmath0 decreases to zero but with finite @xmath2 left over then we will have a @xmath14 theory with @xmath4 flavors that confines in the far ir ( see @xcite for more details ) . the latter theory , or more particularly the high temperature limit of the latter theory",
    ", is what we are interested in and henceforth we will only consider that .    at zero temperature",
    "the dual description ( assuming of course that in this limit the gauge theory decouples from gravity ) involves d7 branes , deformed conifold and fluxes @xcite . due to",
    "the underlying rg flows the supergravity description _ does not _ capture the choppy cascading nature of the gauge theories ! rather the supergravity description only captures the smooth rg flows in the theory .",
    "this would also mean that the actual _ number _ of colors in the theory is rather subtle to define .",
    "these details are explored in @xcite .",
    "once we switch on a temperature in the gauge theory , the dual gravity description loses its simplicity .",
    "we can no longer claim that the fluxes , warp factor etc would remain unchanged .",
    "even the internal manifold can not remain a simple warped deformed conifold any more .",
    "all the internal spheres would get squashed , and at @xmath15 there could be both resolution as well as deformation of the two and three cycles respectively . due to this complicated nature of our background our entire analysis in @xcite is based on the following limit : @xmath16 in @xcite we presented our results to @xmath17 , and discuss how to extend this to higher orders in @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the limit where the deformation parameter is small ,",
    "we show that to @xmath17 we can analytically derive the background taking a resolved conifold geometry .",
    "the resolution parameter @xmath20 depends on @xmath21 as well as on the horizon radius @xmath22 i.e @xmath23 with @xmath24 constant .",

    "( ) = r^1 _ ( ) ,  l_(1 ) = l_(2 ) = l_(4 ) = l^4 ,   l_(3 ) = -2l^4 and @xmath32 is defined in the same way as in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the d7 branes are embedded via ouyang embedding in this background .",
    "note that our analysis to this order is analytic , but beyond this order we loose all analytic control and we can only find the background numerically ( see also @xcite for the background without flavor d7 branes and @xcite for the background with flavor branes ) .",
    "furthermore the @xmath33 dependences of all the fluxes , warp factor and dilaton is only for regions close to the d7 brane . to get a good behavior at far infinity we need to embed the whole system in f - theory @xcite . that would mean inserting extra @xmath34 seven branes at infinity ; and then all the fluxes would go as inverse powers of @xmath35 at large @xmath35 .",
    "in fact in @xcite we made a concrete prediction for the large @xmath35 warp factor : it is given by ( [ logr ] ) except that the sum over @xmath36 now ranges from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "this way we can get rid of possible landau poles ( or naked singularities ) in the background ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand for _",
    "finite _ @xmath21 the small @xmath35 behavior is almost identical to ( [ logr ] ) .",
    "however we could nt derive the precise form for the large @xmath35 behavior of the warp factor .",
    "therefore in @xcite we only speculated a possible inverse @xmath35 behavior for the warp factor .",
    "once we know the dual background we can say that the hilbert space of the gauge theory can be obtained from the hilbert space of the string theory on this geometry . in fact the dual supergravity background captures the strongly coupled gauge theory where we expect the rg flow to be smooth without any choppy seiberg dualities , although we might be able to interpret the strongly coupled gauge theory also as some kind of approximate cascading theory .",
    "as we now know very well , the uv completion of cascading type theories require _ infinite _ degrees of freedom .",
    "once we have infinite degrees of freedom at the uv , we no longer expect a finite boundary action from supergravity analysis !",
    "what we need is to regularise and renormalise the supergravity boundary action so that finite correlation functions could be extracted .",
    "this would also mean that the usual witten type proposal @xcite for the ads / cft correspondence can be re - expressed in terms of the boundary variables to give us the complete picture . therefore we can rewrite the ansatze proposed by witten _",

    "] , @xmath41 is the fluctuation over a given background , @xmath42 is the gibbons - hawking boundary term @xcite and @xmath43 is the counter - term action added to renormalise the action .",
    "the interesting part now is that we can define _ two _ classes of theories in this kind of backgrounds by introducing a cut - off at @xmath44 :    @xmath45 the first class is to analyse the theory right at the usual boundary where @xmath46 .",
    "this is the standard picture where there are infinite degrees of freedom at the boundary , and the theory has a smooth rg flow from uv to ir till it confines ( at least from the weakly coupled gravity dual ) .",
    "@xmath45 the second class is to analyse theories by specifying the degrees of freedom at generic @xmath47 and then defining the theories at the boundary .",
    "all these theories would meet the cascading theory at certain scales under rg flows .",
    "the gravity duals of these theories are the usual resolved - deformed conifold geometries cut - off at various @xmath47 with appropriate uv caps added ( or , alternatively , degrees of freedom specified ) .",
    "these uv caps are non - trivial geometries added to the resolved - deformed conifold geometry from @xmath44 to @xmath48 to @xmath48 .",
    "this is like adding @xmath49 or 2 degrees of freedom at the cut - off scale to uv complete the gauge theories .",
    "one issue here is the connection to the work of @xcite .",
    "the question is can we write a boundary theory at @xmath44 itself instead of going to the actual @xmath48 boundary ? as shown in @xcite this is possible in ads case because the theory on the surface of a ball in ads space does nt have to be a local quantum field theory .",
    "the non - local behavior in such a `` boundary '' theory is completely captured by the wilsonian effective action at the so called boundary . as detailed in @xcite , this is tricky in the klebanov - strassler model precisely because there is no unique strongly coupled gauge theory here . again , as in the rg flow pictures of @xcite , when the dual gravity theory is weakly coupled we have a smooth rg flow in the gauge theory side , but the theory at any given scale can be given by infinite number of representative gauge theories none of which completely capture the full dynamics .",
    "thus it makes more sense to define the theories at @xmath48 boundary only and not at any generic @xmath44 . ] .",
    "in addition to that , both these classes of theories ought to have appropriate number of seven branes so that all the landau poles could be removed .",
    "we can also say that the boundary degrees of freedom are now given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 specifies the parent cascading theory .",
    "for all other theories that we define at the boundary @xmath48 , by cutting off the geometry at @xmath44 , will have @xmath50 going as @xmath53 but now @xmath54 .",
    "yet another interesting thing about all these theories is that _ any _ thermodynamical quantitities defined in these theories will be completely independent of the cut - off @xmath47 and only depend on the temperature @xmath55 ( with an exponentially small dependences on the boundary degrees of freedom ) !",
    "this will be briefly demonstrated in the next section ( see @xcite for the full exposition ) .",
    "[ cascade ]    . for a more correct illustration of the situation",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the outermost blue curves on both sides denote the parent cascading theory.,width=264,height=143 ]",
    "one of the important thermodynamical quantity to extract from our background would be the stress tensor . as the stress tensor couples to the metric",
    ", it s expectation value is obtained from the renormalised action @xmath56 via @xmath57}{\\delta l_{ij}}\\big{|}_{l_{ij}=0}$ ] where @xmath58 is the four dimensional effective metric induced by the ten dimensional metric of the form ( [ bhmet1 ] ) by approximating the metric first by a five dimensional slice and then taking the required pull - back ( see @xcite for details on the procedure ) . at every fixed @xmath35 the five dimensional metric induces a four dimensional metric and with appropriate rescaling of the time coordinate , we can view this effective four dimensional metric as a flat minkowski metric ( with possible perturbations ) .",
    "if @xmath59 denote the perturbations on the background by quark strings that stretch from the d7 branes to the horizon of the black hole , then writing the supergravity action up to quadratic order in @xmath59 ; using integration by parts together with appropriate gibbons - hawking terms ; and holographically renormalising the subsequent action , we obtain : [ wakeup ] & & t^mm_medium + quark = _",

    "the quantities @xmath61 etc . with @xmath62 are completely independent of the radial coordinate @xmath35 and depend on the 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime coordinates .",
    "note also that the stress tensor depends only on the temperature @xmath55 and is independent of any cut - offs .",
    "the dependence on the uv degrees of freedom is exponentially suppressed , and in the limit @xmath63 we reproduce the result for the parent cascading theory .",
    "with the general formulation of stress tensor ( [ wakeup ] ) , which is similar to the ads / cft results @xcite in the limiting case @xmath64 , we can compute the wake a moving quark creates in a plasma with @xmath59 being the metric perturbation due to string ( see @xcite for an equivalent ads calculation ) .",
    "furthermore we can compute the shear viscosity @xmath65 from the kubo formula with the propagator obtained from the dual partition function ( [ ks16 ] ) and the entropy density @xmath66 using wald s formula .",
    "the result for the ratio @xmath67 is given by : [ final1 ] & = &   1 + _ k = 1^_k e^-4k n_uv 4 + 1  log^2 ( 1 - t^4 e^-4n_uv ) + & - & where ( @xmath68 ) are constants that depend on the temperature @xmath55 and @xmath69 ; and @xmath70 is the coefficient of the riemann square term coming from the backreactions of the d7 branes in the background .",
    "these have been explicitly worked out in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath70 dependence of the @xmath67 ratio first appeared in @xcite .    with certain choices of parameters ( @xmath71 ) and ignoring @xmath17 corrections to the black hole parameters",

    "as @xmath76 decreases ( assuming this is possible ! ) the red dashed line dips slightly below the @xmath77 axis , but the solid blue line remains considerably below the @xmath77 axis . for @xmath76 sufficiently small the bound is not violated .",
    "however all the models that we studied here and in @xcite can _ only _ realise the infinite @xmath76 limit , so that the small @xmath76 limit depicted in fig .",
    "2 above is just an extrapolation of ( [ final1 ] ) .",
    "we have analyzed the gravity dual of a thermal gauge theory with logarithmic running coupling which may resemble qcd in the far ir .",
    "it appears that the kss bound for @xmath67 may be violated in certain gauge theories if one carefully takes into account both the running of the couplings as well as the backreactions of the flavor branes in the dual gravity picture , for a range of parameter values ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "it is of course important to test and verify the robustness of this limit , and we view the current work as contributing to this effort .",
    "more work is needed in order to identify the size and extent of this violation , at the moment this violation is only parametric and our parameters need to have better defined physical origins . in the end , one may need to rely on the empirical identification of key quantities , like transport coefficients for example @xcite . in this regard ,",
