    "the @xmath0 is a resonance in the @xmath2 scattering with spin - parity @xmath3 , strangeness @xmath4 , and isospin @xmath5 .",
    "the resonance is found slightly below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "the nature of the @xmath0 has been under a long - standing debate ever since the @xmath0 was predicted and discovered more than fifty years ago  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the failure of the simple three - quark picture to reproduce @xmath0  @xcite urges people to consider more exotic configurations such as the meson - baryon molecular structure  @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) in the heavy quarkonium sector , a simple quark potential model well reproduces the experimental spectra of quarkonia below the @xmath6/@xmath7 threshold .",
    "however , above the open charm / bottom threshold , the experimental spectra significantly disagree with the prediction and there appears plenty of unpredicted states called `` @xmath8 ''  @xcite which are considered to be the candidate of the exotic hadrons : multiquark states , hadronic molecules , and gluon hybrids .",
    "the @xmath0 appears near the @xmath1 threshold and decays into @xmath2 .",
    "this is analogous to @xmath9  @xcite and @xmath10  @xcite which are found around the @xmath11 threshold and decays into the pion(s ) and the charmonium .",
    "( 2 ) importance of the hadron - hadron components is discussed also in the light quark sector .",
    "recent comprehensive study of the @xmath12 resonance in the @xmath13 scattering shows that the `` bare '' state of the @xmath12 , corresponding to the three - quark component , is found around 1800 mev  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore dangerous to naively compare the observed mass of excited baryons with the prediction of the static quark model , because of the dynamical meson - baryon effect .",
    "this reinforces the importance of the meson - baryon component in the study of the excited baryons .",
    "( 3 ) the first principle lattice qcd supports the @xmath1 molecular structure of @xmath0  @xcite . in this way , there many issues which are inconvenient to the simple three - quark model . to insist the three - quark picture for @xmath0",
    ", one has to overcome all these issues and construct a theoretical framework with phenomenologically successful description of the scattering data at the level of @xmath14 as achieved in chiral su(3 ) dynamics . ] .    from modern viewpoint , the @xmath0",
    "is well described as a resonance state in the meson - baryon scattering in the framework of chiral su(3 ) dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1 system is closely related to the spontaneous and explicit breaking of chiral su(3)@xmath15su(3)@xmath16 symmetry in qcd .",
    "the anti - kaon is regarded as the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , while the explicit symmetry breaking by the strange quark mass makes the anti - kaon as massive as @xmath17 mev .",
    "the interesting dynamics of the @xmath1 system and the @xmath0 reflects the unique feature of the anti - kaon in hadron physics .    in recent years",
    ", there have been remarkable achievements in the experimental investigations of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 system .",
    "the siddharta collaboration has determined the shift @xmath18 and width @xmath19 of the 1s level of the kaonic hydrogen through the x - ray measurement as  @xcite @xmath20 because the shift and width can be related to the @xmath21 scattering length  @xcite , this experimental data provides a strong and direct constraint on the @xmath1 scattering amplitude at the fixed energy . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath0 signal in the @xmath2 spectra has been observed in various production experiments , such as the photoproductions by the leps collaboration  @xcite and by the clas collaboration  @xcite , and the proton - proton collisions by the hades collaboration  @xcite .",
    "these spectra are qualitatively different from the old one  @xcite where only a single @xmath22 spectrum is extracted without the normalization of the magnitude . in the new data",
    "@xcite , the absolute value of the differential cross sections are determined in all three charge combinations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this experimentally verifies the isospin interference effect in the @xmath2 spectrum discussed in ref .",
    "the precise measurement also leads to the experimental determination of the spin - parity of the @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "these experimental developments have stimulated the theoretical studies . in the following ,",
    "we first discuss the meson - baryon coupled - channel scattering with the @xmath0 in the framework of the chiral su(3 ) dynamics . the systematic improvement with the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) interaction is now possible owing to the constraint by the siddharta data  ( [ eq : siddharta ] ) .",
    "we then consider the @xmath2 spectrum in which the @xmath0 signal is observed .",
    "finally , we discuss the structure of the @xmath0 from the viewpoint of the @xmath1 wavefunction and the compositeness .",
    "the interaction of the ng bosons with hadrons is dictated by the chiral low - energy theorems , which can be systematically improved by chiral perturbation theory  @xcite . according to the low - energy theorem  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath25-wave scattering of the ng boson with any target hadron is proportional to the energy of the ng boson .",
    "the explicit symmetry breaking provides the mass of the ng boson , which enhances the interaction strength . for pions , the effect of the explicit breaking",
    "is considered to be small , while for kaons , the enhancement of the interaction by the strange quark mass becomes significant .",
    "thus , in contrast to the @xmath26 and @xmath13 scatterings , the low - energy interaction of the @xmath1 system is not perturbatively small .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of the @xmath0 resonance below the @xmath1 threshold , which prevents the description by the perturbative calculation .",
    "we thus need to sum up the chiral interaction @xmath27 nonperturbatively to obtain the scattering amplitude @xmath28 as @xmath29 with the loop function @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath0 and the coupled - channel meson - baryon scattering are well described in this approach  @xcite .",
    "this framework is similar to the chiral effective field theory approach for nuclear force  @xcite ; the interaction potential is constructed by the chiral perturbation theory and the full amplitude is obtained by solving the scattering equation .",
    "the pole structure of the @xmath0 in the complex energy plane shows an interesting property .",
    "in general , a resonance is associated with the pole singularity of the scattering amplitude , corresponding to the eigenenergy of the hamiltonian .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath0 is associated with two poles  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole1405 ] .",
    "the origin of two poles is understood by the two attractive interactions in this sector : flavor singlet and octet channels in the su(3 ) basis  @xcite and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels in the isospin basis  @xcite .",
    "two poles can be interpreted as the @xmath1 quasi - bound state and the @xmath2 resonance by these attractive interactions .",
    "the existence of the attractions is guaranteed by the low - energy theorem .",
    "it is the virtue of the chiral su(3 ) dynamics that the theory can be systematically improved by introducing the higher order contributions .",
    "of course , the higher order terms contain the low - energy constants which need to be determined from the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "in other words , the improvement by the higher order terms is meaningful only when the sufficient amount of reliable experimental data is available .",
    "there have been several studies with higher order terms before the siddharta data  @xcite , but the uncertainty of the subthreshold extrapolation is not small , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the @xmath21 scattering length is precisely determined by siddharta collaboration  @xcite , it is now possible to incorporate the nlo terms with this constraint .",
    "the systematic nlo analysis is performed in refs .",
    "@xcite by fitting the @xmath21 total cross sections , threshold branching ratios , and the @xmath21 scattering length by siddharta .",
    "the best fit result is obtained with @xmath31dof @xmath32 .",
    "we thus find a good description of both the scattering data and the kaonic hydrogen measurement , and solve the inconsistency problem found in the previous measurement of the kaonic hydrogen  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampligude ] , the subthreshold extrapolation of the @xmath1 amplitude is shown .",
    "the uncertainty in the subthreshold extrapolation is significantly reduced , in comparison with the previous studies .",
    "the result demonstrates the importance of the precise determination of the @xmath21 scattering length for the subthreshold @xmath1 amplitude where the @xmath0 exists . once the amplitude is determined on the real axis , we can extrapolate it to the complex energy plane .",
    "two poles are found in the energy region of the @xmath0 as @xmath33 this confirms the two - pole structure of the @xmath0 in the nlo analysis .",
    "the pole @xmath34 appears around 1420 mev , not in the nominal position of 1405 mev .",
    "the position of this pole is closely related with the strength of the @xmath1 interaction  @xcite .     forward scattering amplitude extrapolated to the subthreshold region .",
    "the shaded bands show the uncertainty from the constraints by the siddharta data indicated by the dots .",
    "the figures are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   forward scattering amplitude extrapolated to the subthreshold region .",
    "the shaded bands show the uncertainty from the constraints by the siddharta data indicated by the dots .",
    "the figures are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    using the same framework with the @xmath21 scattering , it is also possible to predict the @xmath35 scattering lengths which reflects the @xmath36 component of the @xmath25-wave meson - baryon scattering .",
    "the predicted @xmath35 scattering length shows certain amount of deviation with respect to the uncertainty of the input , in comparison with the @xmath5 counterpart .",
    "this shows that the @xmath36 component of the scattering length still suffers from the uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath35 scattering length can in principle be determined by the kaonic deuterium measurement .",
    "after refs .",
    "@xcite , several other groups study the @xmath0 in similar approaches  @xcite .",
    "although the formulation of the nonperturbative scattering amplitude and the strategy of the fitting procedure are different , these studies commonly use the chiral nlo interaction and perform the @xmath37 uncertainty analysis including the siddharta data .",
    "thus , the difference of the results can be understood as the systematic uncertainties of the chiral su(3 ) dynamics .",
    "we note that an unphysical solution may be found in the fitting procedure  @xcite , reflecting the large number of parameters .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the consistency check with the @xmath2 spectra excludes the unphysical solution .    in all works , two poles are found in the @xmath0 energy region , as summarized in table  [ tab : comparison ] .",
    "as long as the whole bunch of experimental data is respected , the pole 1 is consistently found around 1420 mev .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained by the comprehensive study of the photoproduction spectra with the leading order chiral interaction in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the position of the pole 2 does not well converge , because the location of the pole is far from the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "future study is needed to pin down the precise position of the second pole of the @xmath0 .    .",
    "comparison of the pole positions of @xmath0 in the complex energy plane from next - to - leading order chiral su(3 ) dynamics including the siddharta constraint .",
    "[ tab : comparison ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the recent progress in the study of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 interaction is discussed .",
    "we have established the systematic approach with the next - to - leading order chiral su(3 ) dynamics together with the @xmath21 scattering data and the siddharta data of the kaonic hydrogen .",
    "these enable us to determine the property of the meson - baryon scattering amplitude and the pole structure of the @xmath0 near the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "there are still remaining uncertainty in the @xmath36 amplitude and in the energy region far below the @xmath1 threshold . as future perspective",
    ", theoretical studies of the @xmath2 spectra in various reactions will be important , in conjunction with the experimental developments .",
