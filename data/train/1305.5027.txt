    "geometrical frustration due to the triangular or tetrahedral arrangement of the magnetic moments , bond frustration as a result of competing ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange interactions and large single ion anisotropy are the fundamental ingredients that eventually determine the complexity of the magnetic ground state and hence the new functionalities in these compounds . often , the ground state of the frustrated materials is extremely sensitive to external perturbations such as magnetic field .",
    "though there are a number of systems showing such kind of magnetic ground state , the underlying mechanism responsible for the above features has not been well understood yet .",
    "+ recently , the quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - chain cov@xmath3o@xmath4 has received attention to the scientific community due to the observation of 1/3 magnetization plateau similar to that observed in a regular triangular lattice @xcite . in monoclinic @xmath2-cov@xmath3o@xmath4 and triclinic @xmath13-cov@xmath3o@xmath4 , the edge - shared coo@xmath4 octahedra form a magnetic chain along the @xmath14 axis , and the edge - shared vo@xmath15 square pyramids are located in between the magnetic chains . the much larger co - co interchain distance as compared to the intrachain co - co distance and the presence of the nonmagnetic v@xmath16 ion in between the chains weaken the interchain magnetic coupling considerably .",
    "both @xmath2-cov@xmath3o@xmath4 and @xmath13-cov@xmath3o@xmath4 show large single ion anisotropy , undergo long - range afm transition below 15 and 6 k , respectively and exhibit field - induced metamagnetic transitions at two critical fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the values of magnetic moment determined from the saturation magnetization ( @xmath19 ) in the field - induced fm state and susceptibility in the paramagnetic ( pm ) state are found to be significantly larger than the expected spin - only moment of high spin - state co@xmath20 ion @xcite . in @xmath2-cov@xmath3o@xmath4 , @xmath19 is as much as 1.5 @xmath21/co larger than the spin - only moment ( 3.0 @xmath21/co ) for @xmath9 parallel to @xmath22 axis .",

    ", @xmath0 can be fitted well with the einstein model to determine the lattice contribution to the specific heat of the system @xcite ( please see figure s1 in the supporting information ) . after subtracting the lattice contribution from @xmath0 ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath47 in fig .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "2(c ) that @xmath47 does not decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath7 in the pm state . the magnetic entropy ( @xmath48 ) obtained by integrating ( @xmath49 is also shown in fig .",
    "@xmath48 does not saturate even at @xmath7 as high as 3@xmath5 , which reflects the highly anisotropic nature of the magnetic structure of @xmath2-cov@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "we would like to mention that the observed value of @xmath48 ( = 8.3 j mol@xmath50 k@xmath50 at @xmath7@xmath63@xmath5 ) for the present sample is about 1.5 times larger than that reported by kim et al . @xcite .",
    "the larger value of @xmath48 is an indication of superior ordering of spins because it means , more number of spins are participating in the magnetic transition .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath48 , however , is significantly smaller than the expected 11.5 j mol@xmath50 k@xmath50 for the high spin co@xmath20 ( @xmath8@xmath63/2 ) .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath48@xmath65.6 j mol@xmath50 k@xmath50 at 20 k is almost in accord with the expected value ( rln2 ) for the degree of freedom of the ising moments .",
    "thus , the entropy of the ising - like spins is mostly released below 20 k. as the intrachain ferromagnetic interaction in cov@xmath27o@xmath28 is much stronger than the interchain afm interaction , the intrachain spin degree of freedom is effectively frozen and the spins would behave like the ising spins and hence , a huge reduction in magnetic entropy occurs .",
    "+ typical specific heat data ( @xmath0/@xmath7 ) in the vicinity of @xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "3 as a function of @xmath7 for different magnetic fields . the application of magnetic field suppresses and broadens the peak at @xmath5 and the peak position shifts slowly towards lower temperature .",
    "apart from these usual changes , another important feature is emerging with increasing field strength . at a field of 2 t , a weak shoulder - like feature starts to appear in @xmath0(@xmath7 ) curve just below 11 k. when the applied field exceeds 2 t , this weak anomaly transforms into a sharp and symmetric peak .",
    "the sharp nature of the peak suggests that the transition is first - order . as this phenomenon occurs in the neighborhood of strong afm ordering transition",
    ", it is difficult to determine the exact position of the peak .",
    "we have determined the positions of the peaks by fitting a pair of gaussian functions plus a background to the data and found that the peak positions do not shift with field .",
    "also , @xmath0 in the low temperature region is gradually enhanced with increasing field up to 5 t and then decreases . in the antiferromagnetic state , initially magnetic entropy ( and hence @xmath0 ) increases with @xmath9 due to the increase of field - induced spin disordering in one of the magnetic sublattices which is antiparallel to applied field . at high fields ,",
    "however , the volume fraction of fm phase increases significantly and as a result , magnetic entropy reduces . in several afm systems where field - induced afm - fm transition occurs , with increasing magnetic field , magnetic entropy initially increases up to a critical field and then decreases @xcite .",

    "the two - peak feature in the temperature dependence of the specific heat has been extensively investigated both in theory and experiments @xcite .",
    "several ferrimagnets and quasi-1d afm spin chains exhibit field - induced peak in @xmath0 due to the opening of an energy gap at low temperature @xcite . in these cases",
    ", however , the peak is not very sharp and symmetric .",
    "also , the peak shifts and broadens with increasing field strength . in dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath51 pyrochlore , the zero - field @xmath0(@xmath7 ) exhibits a single peak but a new sharp and symmetric peak appears at very low temperature with the application of magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we have magnetically aligned the polycrystalline powder sample and done detailed @xmath12(@xmath9 ) and @xmath12(@xmath7 ) measurements to understand the field and temperature induced transitions .",
    "for this aligned sample , @xmath12(@xmath9 ) at 5 k and @xmath12(@xmath7 ) curves for three different fields are shown in the supporting information section ( please see figures s2 and s3 in the supporting information ) .",
    "similar to randomly oriented powder sample , @xmath12(@xmath7 ) shows afm to pm transition at 15 k for applied field below @xmath17 but @xmath12(@xmath7 ) exhibits a sharp peak at 11 k in the field range 1.5 - 3.3 t due to the transition from ferrimagnetic to pm state . above 3.3 t where the system is in field - induced fm state ,",
    "the nature of @xmath12(@xmath7 ) curve is very different . with increasing temperature , @xmath12 decreases very slowly up to about 8 k and then decreases at a faster rate .",
    "this behavior of @xmath12(@xmath7 ) is typical of a fm system in presence of high magnetic field .",
    "though , the transition region gets smeared , d@xmath12/d@xmath7 reveals a minimum at around 11 k. so it is clear that both ferrimagnetic - pm and fm - pm transitions occur almost at same temperature ( 11 k ) .",
    "for this reason , we have not observed a third peak in @xmath0(@xmath7 ) curve at high fields above 3.3 t due to the fm - pm transition . in polycrystalline samples , however , for some crystallites the effective field along the easy axis of magnetization direction can be significantly smaller than the applied field due to their random orientations .",
    "thus , when the applied field exceeds @xmath52 or @xmath53 , these crystallites remain in the afm or ferrimagnetic state and , as a result , different magnetically ordered phases coexist in the sample .",
    "this observation is fully consistent with the reported low - temperature neutron diffraction results @xcite .",
    "powder neutron diffraction studies have revealed the coexistence of different magnetically ordered phases in @xmath2-cov@xmath3o@xmath4 when the strength of applied magnetic field exceeds @xmath52 or @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "for example , both afm and ferrimagnetic phases coexist with volume fractions 0.54 and 0.46 , respectively at 2.5 t. however , both the phases decrease substantially and fm phase appears at fields above @xmath53 . at 5 t , the volume fractions of afm ,",
