    "the magnitude of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath6 can be determined experimentally by observing the decays of @xmath7 mesons produced in @xmath8 collisions .",
    "in particular , one method requires the measurement of the rate of the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath9 ( see , eg . , @xcite ) .",
    "from the decay rate , measured at the zero recoil point , i.e. , in the special kinematical situation where the @xmath10 is produced at rest in the @xmath7 rest frame , one can then extract the value of @xmath11 .",
    "this method has been used by experiments where @xmath7 mesons are produced on the @xmath12 resonance @xcite and on the @xmath13 resonance @xcite .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors are currently of the order of @xmath14 . however , in the future , with the cesr collider at cornell running at increased luminosity , the asymmetric @xmath7 factories at kek and slac coming into operation , and further @xmath7-physics experiments to be conducted at the hadron accelerators tevatron , hera and lhc ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the errors are expected to come down to around @xmath15 or less @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important that the theoretical input , that is needed to extract @xmath11 from the measured decay rates , be known with equal precision .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present one component of that theoretical input , namely the second order perturbative qcd corrections to the decay of a @xmath16 quark into a @xmath17 quark at zero recoil .",
    "the other part of the theoretical input consists of non - perturbative corrections which are described by an expansion in the heavy quark masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for a review of heavy quark theory and further references , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the reason for using the zero recoil point is that at that point , the non - perturbative contributions are suppressed by a factor of @xmath20 , because of an additional symmetry that exists in the infinite quark mass limit . at the same time",
    ", however , the zero recoil condition simplifies the kinematics of the decay @xmath21 to such an extent , that a complete analytical calculation of the perturbative corrections at the two - loop level becomes feasible .    at tree level ,",
    "the amplitude for @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath22 . in higher orders ,",
    "this gets modified into @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are given by perturbation series in @xmath25 .",
    "( only @xmath26 enters the expression for @xmath9 . ) at zero recoil , no other lorentz structures appear .",
    "the order @xmath25 contributions were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the feynman diagrams that contribute to @xmath24 in order @xmath27 are shown in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "they were calculated analytically in @xcite , confirming the results of a taylor series expansion in @xmath28 @xcite that had been obtained earlier by one of the authors of @xcite . in this paper , we present an independent analytic calculation of @xmath24 . although our results are expressed in a slightly different way , they are completely equivalent to the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , we confirm the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : calc ] describes the main steps of the calculation .",
    "although the details are different , the methods we have used are nevertheless related to the ones employed and extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "the major part of the work is the calculation of a set of scalar integrals , many of which contain infrared divergences .",
    "one example is looked at more closely , and various ways we checked our calculation are discussed .",
    "the final results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] and are followed by our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] . as a by - product of our work",
    ", we developed a new version of a numerical technique for evaluating a class of two - loop feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "the new version is much more suitable for dealing with some of the rather special diagrams that occur in this calculation .",
    "however , because the method itself is quite general and may be useful for other problems as well , it is explained briefly in an appendix .",

    "an important consequence of the zero recoil condition is that there is no phase space available for gluon bremsstrahlung , @xmath30 , and thus , only the virtual corrections shown in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] are needed .",
    "we calculate them in the feynman gauge and use dimensional regularization for both ultraviolet and infrared divergences .",
    "we neglect the masses of all the light quarks , and we leave out the diagram where a @xmath31 quark loop is inserted into the gluon propagator . with these restrictions , all diagrams can be written in terms of the following nine propagator denominators : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are loop momenta and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the four - momenta of the incoming @xmath16 quark and the outgoing @xmath17 quark , respectively",
    ". normally , seven of the denominators @xmath37 would be linearly independent , but because of the zero recoil condition , which means that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are proportional to each other , @xmath38 , we have two additional linear relationships between them : @xmath39 this greatly simplifies the calculation .    after projecting the diagrams onto the form factors @xmath24 , we use an anticommuting @xmath40 . ] and expressing all scalar products of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 that appear in the numerators in terms of the @xmath37 , which we do using form  @xcite , we obtain for each one a combination of scalar integrals of the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( some of the @xmath43 can be negative ) .",
    "the scalar integrals that occur can be classified into three groups .",
    "the first group consists of integrals that can be factorized as a product of two one - loop integrals , e.g. : @xmath44    the second group consists of integrals in which either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , so that they only depend on one mass scale",
    ". such integrals also occur in on - shell fermion self - energies and in anomalous magnetic moments , and can be calculated using recurrence relations based on integration by parts @xcite . a detailed explanation of the algorithm is given in @xcite .",
    "the third group contains the non - factorizable graphs that depend on @xmath47 and on @xmath48 .",
    "although one can still derive relations between them using integration by parts , those relations are more complicated than in the case of just one mass scale .",
    "we find them to be quite useful in a few cases , but are still left with rather a large number of cases we have to calculate from scratch .    before actually calculating the remaining integrals in the third group ,",
    "it is worth while to investigate their analytic properties by solving the landau equations .",
    "one finds that they can have singularities when @xmath49 or @xmath50 . at @xmath51",
    "there are no singularities because , although some poles in the propagators coincide at that point , the integration contours are not pinched",
    ". however , there may be singularities at @xmath51 on the analytic continuation to higher riemann surfaces .",
    "the following very simple one - loop example illustrates these properties : @xmath52 if we analytically continue the right hand side of this equation in , say , @xmath48 , going around the branch point at @xmath50 and then back to @xmath53 , @xmath54 changes into @xmath55 , which no longer cancels @xmath56 , and as a result , a pole appears at @xmath57 .",
    "in addition to the singularities just mentioned , a certain subclass of the two - loop integrals ( [ eq : generalscalarint ] ) can also have singularities when they are analytically continued to the point @xmath58 .",
    "the integrals in this subclass correspond to graphs that can be cut into two pieces by removing exactly three massive quark propagators .",
    "they only occur in diagrams @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] , and in diagram @xmath62 , when the quark in the loop is massive .",
    "while this discussion of analytic continuations to negative masses and higher riemann surfaces may seem academic , keeping these properties in mind while actually doing the integrations can be very helpful , because it tells us which polylogarithms we can expect to occur in the answer .",
    "we have done most of the integrals needed using feynman parametric representations of the kind described in @xcite . sometimes , it is convenient to differentiate a diagram with respect to one ( or both ) of the masses first , in order to reduce the number of different kinds of propagators , and thus the number of feynman parameters , and then reintegrate with respect to the mass to get the final answer . for the integration",
    "constant , we can take the equal mass point , which belongs to the second group discussed above .",
    "another reason why we might want to differentiate with respect to masses , is to make an integral less infrared divergent .",
    "let us take the six - propagator integral @xmath63 shown in figure  [ fig : ddm ] as an example .",
    "it is one of the contributions that come from diagram @xmath60 in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "this particular integral has no ultraviolet divergence , but it does contain an infrared divergence coming from the region where both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are small . our goal is to express it in terms of other integrals in which one ( or both ) of the massless propagators @xmath64 and @xmath65 are cancelled . let @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a fixed four - vector with @xmath68 . first , consider differentiation with respect to @xmath48 . using the identities , @xmath69 we get @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 the integral @xmath73 is already finite , but it can be simplified further by repeating the above procedure with @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 : @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 on the other hand , @xmath77 is still just as divergent as @xmath78 .",
    "however , since it no longer contains @xmath79 , it is now easy to cancel @xmath65 : @xmath80 from figure  [ fig : ddm ] , it is obvious that @xmath81 . thus , in order to obtain the integral @xmath78 , all one needs to know are the two finite , four - propagator integrals @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which are relatively easy to do by feynman parametrization , and , as an integration constant , the value of @xmath84 , which can be calculated by recurrence relations . neglecting terms of order @xmath85",
    ", we find @xmath86 where the dimensionless variable @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88 , and , after performing the final integrations over @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath89 it is comforting to see that the result is symmetric in @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as it clearly should be .",
    "we will not present formulae for all the non - factorizable two - mass scalar integrals ( [ eq : generalscalarint ] ) that appear in the diagrams of figure  [ fig : diagrams ] , but mention that they can all be expressed in terms of the following basic set of logarithms and polylogarithms : @xmath90   { { \\mbox{li}}_{3}\\left(\\frac{u}{u+1}\\right)}\\,,\\quad   { { \\mbox{li}}_{3}\\left(\\frac{u}{u-1}\\right)}\\,,\\quad   { { \\mbox{li}}_{3}\\left(\\frac{2 u}{u+1}\\right)}\\,,\\quad   { { \\mbox{li}}_{3}\\left(\\frac{2 u}{u-1}\\right)}\\,,\\quad   { { \\mbox{li}}_{3}\\left(\\frac{4 u}{(u+1)^2}\\right)}\\,,\\quad   { { \\mbox{li}}_{3}\\left(\\frac{-4 u}{(u-1)^2}\\right)}\\ , . \\end{array}\\ ] ] these functions are all real and analytic in the range @xmath91 , which corresponds to real , positive masses @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to verify that their only singularities are located at @xmath92 , and in some cases @xmath93 , in accordance with the general properties inferred above from the landau equations .",
    "the functions that have branch points at @xmath93 only occur in diagrams with massive three - particle cuts , and the trilogarithms only occur in five - propagator integrals .",
    "we applied various checks on the results for the scalar integrals .",
    "first of all , we evaluated the ones that are finite in @xmath94 by direct numerical integration in momentum space , basically by a straightforward extension of the method originally proposed in @xcite for the two - point two - loop ",
    "master \" diagram with general masses . however , there are a few finite integrals that can not easily be evaluated by this method , unless an important modification is made , which is explained in the appendix",
    ". then , there are a number of  sunset \" integrals , which we checked numerically by means of dispersion relations @xcite , and a few other two - point functions we compared with the program package xloops  @xcite .",
    "a simple analytical check that can be applied to all two - mass integrals is to compare the first few terms of their taylor expansions in @xmath87 with what one gets by expanding the propagators around the equal mass point ( @xmath51 ) under the integral sign ( as was done from the outset in @xcite ) . while this is a powerful test ,",
    "it is not sensitive to possible mistakes in the integration constants in diagrams calculated by differentiating and then reintegrating with respect to the masses . therefore , for some integrals , we also looked at their asymptotic behaviour in the limit when @xmath47 or @xmath48 vanishes ( @xmath95 ) . in this limit ,",
    "the diagrams are again reduced to one - scale integrals , but it is more complicated than the equal mass limit because , in general , the diagrams become more strongly divergent when one of the masses vanishes .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to obtain the correct asymptotic behaviour by expanding under the integral sign , provided one adds certain counterterms corresponding to the taylor expansion of certain subdiagrams of the diagram considered , following the prescription for asymptotic expansions on the mass shell given in @xcite .    to conclude this list of consistency checks , we mention two tests that we applied to the contributions of complete diagrams , rather than individual scalar integrals .",
    "we verified that if @xmath47 and @xmath48 are interchanged , diagrams @xmath96 and @xmath97 in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] are transformed into each other , and similarly @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is a consequence of charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "secondly , by putting the masses of the two external quarks equal to each other , we reproduced the two - loop on - shell quark wave - function renormalization constants in @xcite . except for one part",
    " the contribution of a quark loop whose mass is neither zero , nor equal to that of the external quark line  which we calculated separately , we could obtain all the wave - function renormalization factors by simply substituting @xmath105 in our formulae for contributions to @xmath106 .",
    "here , we present our results for @xmath24 up to @xmath3 in qcd with @xmath107 colours and @xmath108 flavours of massless quarks , but no @xmath31 quarks .",
    "the colour factors are given by @xmath109 following @xcite , we renormalize the strong coupling constant in the @xmath110 scheme at the scale @xmath111 but use on - shell renormalization for the masses .",
    "this renormalization procedure has the nice property that it respects the symmetry under @xmath112 mentioned at the end of the previous section .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 are even functions of the variable : @xmath113 this symmetry was exploited in @xcite by using the variable @xmath114 rather than @xmath115 as an expansion parameter , in order to obtain a more rapidly converging series .",
    "it turns out that the trilogarithms @xmath116 and @xmath117 , which appear in the contributions of diagrams @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , cancel out in the sum @xmath118 .",
    "the other functions ( [ eq : basicpolylogs ] ) appear in the following combinations : @xmath119 note that @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are odd functions of @xmath87 , while @xmath123 and @xmath124 are even .",
    "the abbreviations @xmath125 and @xmath126 are defined by @xmath127 finally , the results are @xmath128\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath129 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that every single term in the expressions ( [ eq : etav ] ) and ( [ eq : etaa ] ) is manifestly analytic in @xmath87 for at least @xmath130 .",
    "this fact , combined with the symmetry @xmath131 , proves ( once more ) that @xmath24 can be represented by convergent power series in @xmath132 for all finite positive values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we have performed an independent calculation of the vector and axial vector form factors @xmath106 and @xmath26 that describe the decay of a @xmath16 quark into a @xmath17 quark at zero recoil up to order @xmath27 .",
    "we have compared our expressions ( [ eq : etav ] ) and ( [ eq : etaa ] ) with the corresponding formulae in @xcite by rewriting the latter in terms of the functions  ( [ eq : basicpolylogs ] ) used in this paper , and found that the two calculations are in perfect agreement .",
    "both confirm the series expansion in the mass difference @xmath133 obtained earlier in @xcite .",
    "the actual numerical values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are such that a few terms of the series expansion are already sufficient to achieve the accuracy that is needed in practice ( @xmath134 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the exact analytical formulae are not only valid for @xmath0 decays , but also for other cases , such as @xmath135 , where the mass ratio is larger , and the series expansion converges more slowly .",
    "they also allow one to study the limit when one of the quark masses goes to zero , which is impossible if only a limited number of terms of an expansion in the mass difference are known .    in the appendix ,",
    "we have identified the cause of a numerical difficulty that arises when the two - dimensional numerical integration method of @xcite is applied to certain two - loop diagrams with several coinciding thresholds , and suggested an alternative method that solves the problem .",
    "we would like to thank j.g .",
    "krner for suggesting this project and p. post for helping us check some sunset diagrams .",
    "we are also grateful to a.  czarnecki , a.g .",
    "grozin , k.  melnikov , m.  neubert and d.  pirjol for discussions .",
    "this work was partly supported by the graduiertenkolleg `` elementarteilchenphysik bei mittleren und hohen energien '' at the johannes gutenberg university in mainz .",
    "in this appendix , some details of the numerical integration methods we used to check the scalar two - loop integrals appearing in this work are given .",
    "we restrict ourselves to cases that are both ultraviolet and infrared finite in @xmath94 .",
    "basically , we follow the approach proposed in @xcite for the numerical integration of the scalar two - point two - loop master diagram with general masses .",
    "the fact that the diagrams occurring here are three - point diagrams is not a problem : since the external momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 are proportional to each other , they have a common rest frame , and all the steps in the derivation of the integral representation given in @xcite can be repeated with only a few trivial changes in the formulae . however , the fact that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are on their respective mass shells does give rise to some difficulties , which we discuss here .    by writing the loop momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the common rest frame of @xmath35 and @xmath36 as @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and integrating out their space components @xmath138 , @xmath139 , we obtain representations of the form @xmath140 for the scalar integrals ( [ eq : generalscalarint ] ) . here",
    ", we have explicitly indicated the dependence on the small imaginary quantity @xmath141 which is added to all propagator denominators in accordance with the causal prescription . as a function of the complex variable @xmath142 , the integrand @xmath143 has singularities ( branch points ) located at the positions shown in figure  [ fig : k0plane ] .",
    "identical pictures can be drawn for the complex variable @xmath144 and for the combination @xmath145 . when the limit @xmath146 is taken , the singularities move onto the real @xmath142 and @xmath144 axes",
    ". in general , this makes the integrals along the real axes more difficult to evaluate numerically and in some cases even divergent .",
    "sometimes , for example when the scalar integral under consideration does not contain either of the gluon propagators @xmath64 and @xmath147 , the problem can be solved by rotating the integration contours away from the real axes by an angle @xmath148 ( which must be the same for @xmath142 and @xmath144 ) , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and subsequently shifting ( one of ) them away from the origin , @xmath151 , as shown in figure  [ fig : k0plane ] .",
    "scalar integrals we checked in this way include @xmath73 in figure  [ fig : ddm ] and @xmath152 .",
    "this escape is not possible in diagrams where both the @xmath142 and @xmath144 contours are trapped at the origin by gluon propagators , such as , e.g. , @xmath153 we stress that if the limit @xmath146 is taken after all integrations have been performed , one obtains a finite result for the integral ( [ eq : nasty ] ) , it reduces to the one difficult one - scale integral @xmath154 needed in two - loop qcd or qed corrections to on - shell fermion propagators @xcite . ] .",
    "however , one would like to set @xmath155 to zero , or at least , very close to zero , _ before _ performing the @xmath142 and @xmath144 integrations in ( [ eq : intk0l0 ] ) , and , if one attempts to do so , a non - integrable singularity appears at the point @xmath156 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath157 as @xmath158 . in the original integral ( [ eq : nasty ] ) , this logarithmic divergence comes from the region where @xmath159 and @xmath160 tend to zero , while @xmath142 and @xmath144 are of order @xmath161 , @xmath162 , as one can see by rescaling @xmath163 under this transformation , the integration measure in ( [ eq : nasty ] ) scales like @xmath164 , while , for small @xmath165 , the integrand goes like @xmath166 .",
    "the problem can be solved very easily by interchanging the order of the integrations .",
    "that is , we first perform the @xmath142 , @xmath144 and all angular integrations analytically , leaving two integrations over @xmath167 and @xmath168 to be done numerically .",
    "below , we shall give an explicit formula for the resulting integrand .",
    "although our main reason for deriving it was the need for an independent check on our analytic results for ( [ eq : nasty ] ) and a few other , equally nasty cases , the formula is valid for a much more general diagram : @xmath169 where @xmath170 with the restriction that all momenta @xmath171 are proportional to one another .",
    "apart from that , the @xmath171 and the masses @xmath172 are arbitrary .",
    "depending on the choice of the @xmath171 , ( [ eq : defefirst ] ) then corresponds to a diagram with two , three or four external legs .",
