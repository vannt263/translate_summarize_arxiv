    "many different physical processes have been proposed to explain the heating and acceleration of plasma emanating from polar coronal holes and resulting in the fast solar wind streams .",
    "basically two competing theories have been proposed : the first one envisages ubiquitous magnetic reconnections occurring at the base of the corona ( the so - called nano - flare heating , originally proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to a dissipation of magnetic stresses produced by fieldlines footpoints motions at the coronal base ( also referred to as direct current heating ) .",
    "the second theory invoques the propagation and dissipation along magnetic field lines of different types of mhd waves ( e.g. magnetoacoustic , alfvn , ion - cyclotron waves ) , also referred to as alternating current heating ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review on the coronal heating problem ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have suggested that also a ubiquitous coronal mass supply in which chromospheric plasma ( i.e. spicules ) is accelerated upward into the corona , and they provide constraints on the coronal heating mechanisms . for this reason , over the last decades many attempts have been performed to provide evidence for detection of waves in the corona and to quantify the energy provided by wave dissipation .",
    "a complete review of wave detections in the corona is far from the purposes of this work : here we briefly review main works published on the detection of waves as a broadening of spectral line profiles observed in corona above the limb .",
    "this effect , which has been observed with spectroscopic , spectropolarimetric and interferometric measurements , is often interpreted as a signature of alfvn waves propagating undamped in a density stratified corona , because these waves are expected to be responsible for unresolved plasma motions occurring also with a component along the line of sight ( both towards and away from the observer ) , hence leading to a spectral line profile broadening .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , a detection of a decrease , instead of an increase , of the line width above a given altitude , would imply a damping of alfvn waves , hence energy deposition in the corona .",
    "one of the first evidences of increasing line profile widths with altitude was obtained during a total solar eclipse by @xcite with a fabry - perot ( fp ) interferometer : they found a rise of the fe  xiv @xmath12 (  ) coronal line - width from 0.07 r@xmath0 ( measured from the solar limb ) to 0.18 - 0.2 r@xmath0 and then a tendency to fall off with higher radial distance .",
    "more recently , this result was confirmed by @xcite , who studied the variation in the fe  xiv line width in the inner corona ( above 0.1 r@xmath0 ) with lasco / c1 ( 1996 - 1998 ) data , acquired with a fp interferometer used as a narrow - passband , tunable filter .",
    "@xcite found that the fe  xiv line width was roughly constant or increased with height up to around 0.3 r@xmath0 , and then it decreased .",
    "even if the interpretation of these line broadenings as signatures of alfvn waves is not universally accepted , recent results demonstrate that the lower corona is permeated by these waves .",
    "@xcite identified low - frequency ( @xmath135mhz ) propagating alfvnic motions in the solar corona from linear polarization images of the fe  xiii @xmath14 line . in the chromosphere alfvnic motions",
    "have been observed by @xcite with hinode / sot , and @xcite have studied their relationship with chromospheric spicules observed at solar limb .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated by hinode / xrt data that coronal x - ray polar jets occurs at a larger rate than previously reported ( @xmath15 events per hour ) and that these jets are associated with small scale mass ejections propagating at velocities close to what expected for alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "a very large number of published work were based on spectroscopic observations .",
    "first studies date back to the skylab data and have shown an increase of line width as a function of height above the limb ( lines emitted by chromospheric or transition region ions with t@xmath16 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found an increase in the line width up to 0.2 r@xmath0 above the limb by analyzing several line profiles from the off - limb quiet corona .",
    "studies of the equatorial coronal regions from soho data ( sumer and cds ) have confirmed the broadening of spectral line width as a function of height above the limb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in polar regions , @xcite",
    ", analyzing si  viii spectra by sumer , have found an increase in the non - thermal velocity up to 0.25 r@xmath0 .",
    "this result was confirmed also by @xcite through mg  x line observations provided by sumer in a polar coronal hole .",
    "@xcite observed , from spectra obtained by cds , a decrease of the mg  x line width at 0.15 r@xmath0 , where the dominant excitation changes from collisional to radiative .    while there is a general consensus that euv line profiles broden in polar coronal holes moving off - limb up to @xmath17 r@xmath0 , the line width behaviour above that altitude is not well determined .",
    "for instance , some authors found that the line width profile shows a `` plateau '' above a given altitude ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , instead of a decrease .",
    "moreover , @xcite reported detection of alfvn waves from the study of the variation of line widths in coronal hole off - limb region by analyzing sumer / soho data , but they claim no evidence for damping of the alfvn waves because they found that the effect of stray light explained the observed decrease with height in the width of several spectral lines , starting about 0.10.2 r@xmath0 above the limb . this result",
    "was also confirmed from a later study by @xcite .",
    "the launch of the hinode mission opened new possibilities , thanks to the eis spectrometer .",
    "recently , @xcite have identified the signature of alfvn waves in euv spectra observed with hinode / eis spectrometer in a polar coronal hole through the increase of the nonthermal line - of - sight velocities up to @xmath18 150  above the limb .",
    "these waves appears to propagate undamped up to @xmath17 r@xmath0 above the limb , while it is at the moment unclear whether energy deposition in the corona occurs above this altitude .",
    "similar work has been performed recently by @xcite , using spectroscopic observations of soho / sumer and hinode / eis , where they conclude that the observed propagating disturbances are magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "nevertheless , none of these works studied with eis the behaviour of these waves at larger altitudes .",
    "hence , in order to investigate the energy deposition by alfvn waves in polar regions above @xmath19 r@xmath0 , between february 2425 , 2009 a special off - limb study of a polar coronal hole has been performed with the hinode / eis spectrometer ( hop 103 , eis study 340 ) . as we describe here , these unique dataset allowed for the first time to study with eis the line profile broadening up to @xmath20 r@xmath0 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in   2 , the observations acquired for this study and the data reduction techniques are outlined . in   3 , results of electron densities , non - thermal velocities and alfvn waves energy flux are presented .",
    "a discussion of the observational results and a comparison with theoretical studies are taken up in   4 , together with the final conclusions .",
    "the hinode euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ; * ? ? ? * ) observes high - resolution spectra in two wavelength bands : 170 - 212   ( short wavelength band ) and 246 - 292   ( long wavelength band ) .",
    "the instrument has 4 available entrance slits : two are available for imaging , with projected widths of 40  and 266  , and two are dedicated to spectroscopy with projected widths of 1  and 2  , oriented along the north  south direction . pixel sizes on the detector are 1  ( spatial dimension ) and 0.0223   ( spectral dimension ) . for single exposures",

    "* for a detailed description of the eis instrument ) .",
    "the aim of the hinode / eis study @xmath21 340 was to measure the non - thermal velocities of various coronal ions above a polar coronal hole up to @xmath4 r@xmath0 above the limb . hence , between february 2425 , 2009 , the 512  long eis slit was centered above the south polar coronal hole , 202  above the limb , covering a range of altitudes from @xmath22 r@xmath0 below the limb up to @xmath23 r@xmath0 above the limb ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio and perform reliable gaussian line fittings up to @xmath24 r@xmath0 , the instrument acquired @xmath25 hours of continuous `` sit & stare '' observations with the 1  slit centered at x=0  and y=-1162  ( 155 exposures , 500 s exposure time ) .",
    "these observations allowed us to derive the first eis `` deep field spectra '' of euv spectral lines in the off - limb polar coronal hole .",
    "moreover , in order to have an idea of the structures ( plumes or inter - plumes ) present in the surrounding corona , two spatial rasters , each @xmath26 hours long , have been acquired covering 80  in the x direction with the 2  slit ( 40 exposures , 100 s exposure time - hereafter `` context study '' ) .",
    "the first `` context study '' was performed before the `` sit & stare '' observations , the second one at the end of the `` sit & stare '' observations . the field of views ( fovs ) covered with the spatial and temporal rasters",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .    due to hinode telemetry limitations , for this study we were able to select only 10 spectral panels ( 32 spectral bins per panel , equivalent to @xmath27 ) .",

    "all the following fe lines have been detected in this study with good statistics ( i.e. with line peak intensity at least 2 times larger than the surrounding background ) : fe  x @xmath2193.71 , fe  xii @xmath2186.88 , fe  xii @xmath2193.51 , fe  xii @xmath2195.12 and fe  xiii @xmath2202.04 .",

    "third , each identified spectral line has been fitted with a gaussian profile , in order to derive the evolution with time of the integrated emission at each altitude covered by the 512 slit spatial bins .",
    "fourth , a further correction has been applied to the intensity versus time maps in order to remove a periodic pointing displacement by @xmath29  observed in the y direction , related to the spacecraft orbit and observed as an apparent periodic limb oscillation ( fig .",

    "resulting intensities do not show clear transit of plumes / interplume structures dragged by solar rotation in and out of the spectrometer fov ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , right panel ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the global diffuse appearance of the off - limb euv corona during our observations , as shown by the context eis observations acquired before and after the `` sit & stare '' observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , left panels ) , and also by eit images ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "no clear plume or inter - plume structures are visible at that time , and the line intensity evolution simply shows a very slow decrease during our observations .",
    "we were then unable to distinguish between these different structures . in order to have a better statistics , in this analysis",
    "we have summed over time all data acquired during the `` sit & stare '' study .",
    "hence , physical parameters we will derive in the next sections have to be considered as representative of an average plume / interplume plasma . moreover , at higher altitudes , summing over @xmath25 hours of observations was not sufficient to have a good statistic on the line profiles .",
    "hence , as also done by @xcite , profiles at the southern off - limb edge of the slit were averaged over different spatial intervals , summing over a larger number of pixels at higher altitudes .",
    "an example of line profiles obtained at 3 different altitudes with different spatial averages ( considered in the analysis ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] : it is clear that the spectral lines are detected with a good statistics even at 0.4 r@xmath0 above the limb .      the line profiles obtained in the fe  xii @xmath2195 spectral window ( 194.785195.477  ) by averaging over the whole observation interval are shown in fig .  [ fig05 ] ( top left panel ) at 3 different altitudes .",
    "this plot shows that on - disk two more spectral lines are present , centered approximately at @xmath2194.828    and @xmath2195.416   , as we derived with a multi - gaussian fitting .",
    "both these lines disappear quickly moving off - limb , as shown by the average profiles at 50  and 150  off - limb in this figure .",
    "the fe  xii @xmath2195.119 is observed in our spectra at @xmath2195.139 , hence there is a shift by @xmath300.020    with respect to reference wavelenght .",
    "this means that the corrected centroids of the unidentified lines are @xmath2194.808 and @xmath2195.396 .",
    "the identification of these two spectral lines is not straightforward : the latest version of the chianti spectral code ( v.7.0 ; * ? ? ?",

    "hence , the chianti code does not provide any possible identification for the @xmath2194.808 and @xmath2195.396 lines which we have observed . in the literature , @xcite identified with eis in this range the fe  xiv @xmath2195.274 and fe  x @xmath2195.395 lines ( observed at the limb and 20  off - limb ) , while @xcite identified a line observed at @xmath2195.415 as the fe  vii @xmath2195.391 line .",
    "other possible lines close to the fe  xii @xmath2195.12 have been reported by @xcite ( see their fig .  6 ) , which identified the fe  xiv @xmath2195.25 , fe  x @xmath2195.40 and ni  xv @xmath2195.52 ; ni  xiv @xmath2195.27 was also reported by @xcite . a line observed at @xmath2195.39",
    "was identified by @xcite as the fe  viii @xmath2195.39 line .",
    "nevertheless , fe  xiv @xmath2195.25 , ni  xv @xmath2195.52 and fe  viii @xmath2195.39 were reported in active regions in these works .",
    "in particular , the fe  xiv and ni  xv lines have peak emission temperatures of @xmath31 k and @xmath32 k , respectively , and no significant emission is expected from these lines in a coronal hole below 0.4 r@xmath0 off - limb , where sumer and eis data show electron temperatures tipically below @xmath33 k @xcite .    hence , there are at least three possible candidates for the identification of the line we observed at @xmath2195.396 , i.e. fe  viii @xmath2195.388 , fe  x @xmath2195.395 and fe  vii @xmath2195.391 .",
    "the main difference between these lines is obviously the peak temperature of their emissivities : while the fe  x line emissivity peaks at @xmath34 k , hence at typical coronal temperatures , the fe  vii emissivity peaks at @xmath35 k ( as provided by chianti code ) , hence it is mainly a transition region line .",
    "this means that it is possible to distinguish between these two lines by looking at their intensity profiles with altitude .",
    "in fact , plots in the top - right panel of figure  [ fig05 ] show that the intensities of fe  xii @xmath2195.12 , fe  xiii @xmath2202.04 and fe  x @xmath2193.71 coronal lines have very similar decays off - limb , while the intensity of the unidentified line at @xmath2195.396 decays much faster ( in particular much faster than the fe  x @xmath2193.71 line ) and is mainly unobserved above @xmath36  off - limb ( @xmath18 0.13 r@xmath0 ) .",
    "this suggests us that the line we observe at @xmath2195.396 is not a coronal line and could be identified as the fe  vii @xmath2195.391 transition region line .",
    "nevertheless , a contribution also from the fe  viii @xmath2195.39 line can not be totally excluded , in principle , because the contribution function of this line peaks at a temperature of @xmath37 k and has a broader temperature distribution , making possible some contribution from the @xmath33 k coronal hole plasma , even if ( as far as we know ) , this line has been never reported off - limb in this kind of region .",
    "the identification of our unidentified line as fe  vii @xmath2195.391 can not be verified by comparing its intensity with those observed in other lines from the same multiplet , because no other fe  vii lines are present in our dataset .",
    "given the observed fe  x @xmath2193.71 intensity , we can at least estimate the expected contribution by the fe  x @xmath2195.395 line to the observed unidentified line . as provided by the chianti spectral code ( v. 7.0 ) , the fe  x @xmath2195.39/@xmath2193.71 line ratio is almost constant in the off - limb coronal hole density range ( @xmath38 @xmath11 ) on the order of @xmath39 . from the observed fe  x @xmath2193.71 intensity",
    "we conclude that the expected fe  x @xmath2195.39 intensity should be smaller than 12% and 43% of the total intensity of the unidentified line , 5  and 390  above the limb , respectively .",
    "these values represent only upper limits , because have been computed before the correction for stray light , i.e. before removing the part of the radiation which is emitted on - disk and that , following optical paths not originally intended in the spectrometer , is finally detected off - limb .",
    "hence we conclude that the fe  x @xmath2195.39 coronal emission is expected to be much smaller than the intensity observed in the unidentified line . unfortunately , we have no other fe  viii lines in our dataset , hence we were not able to perform the same estimate of the expected fe  viii @xmath2195.39 contribution to the total intensity of our unidentified line .    in summary , taking into account",
    "that , as mentioned above , a ) the intensity of the unidentified line decays with altitude much faster than other coronal lines , b ) that coronal emissions from other lines observed in this range ( such as fe  xiv and ni  xv ) are expected to be negligible in a coronal hole below 0.4 r@xmath0 off - limb , and c ) that the fe  x @xmath2195.39 coronal emission is expected to be much smaller than the intensity of the unidentified line , we conclude that the observed unidentified line mainly is not due to coronal emission , even if some contribution from fe  viii @xmath2195.39 can not be totally excluded . for these reasons , the line observed at @xmath2195.396 has been identified here as the fe  vii @xmath2195.391 transition region line . if this interpretation is correct , its off - limb intensity should decay with altitude much faster than what we observed , becoming unobservable @xmath40  off - limb ( corresponding to an altitude of @xmath41 km ) .",
    "this implies that the intensity we observe above this altitude can be ascribed to stray light of the eis instrument .",
    "as recently estimated by the eis team @xcite , the stray light contribution for on - disk observations is on the order of 2% of the total intensity .",
    "in order to estimate the off - limb stray light contribution , we employed the same technique recently applied by @xcite : given the intensity @xmath42 of the fe  vii @xmath2195.39 line observed on - disk , we assumed that 2% of this intensity corresponds to the total fe  vii brightness scattered off in the bins looking in the off - limb corona .",
    "so , the stray light intensity is simply @xmath43 .",
    "the ratio between the @xmath44 and the fe  vii intensity observed off - limb at different altitudes @xmath45 provides the stray light percentage curve @xmath46 , which is given by @xmath47 notice that the stray light computed with this technique may be slightly underestimated , because the 2% estimate made by @xcite corresponds to the `` minimum stray light level above the dark current '' . in any case , this estimate was also recently validated by @xcite by checking the ratio between the si  x @xmath2256.3/261.0 lines observed immediately off - limb after removing from the he  ii",
    "@xmath2256.3 - si  vii @xmath2256.3 blend the 2% of the average he  ii disk intensity .",
    "the stray light curve resulting from the above equation is shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] ( dotted line ) : the stray light contribution increases with increasing off - limb altitudes up to @xmath48 % at an altitude of 0.4 r@xmath0 off - limb . even if , as explained above , the straylight values could be in principle underestimated , both because the 2% value is the minimum on - disk stray light level , and because a contribution from the fe  x @xmath2195.39 and fe  viii @xmath2195.39 coronal emissions can not be totally excluded , this curve is in very good agreement with stray light values recently derived by @xcite at 0.10 , 0.15 and 0.20 r@xmath0 with other spectral lines ( triangles in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the fe  x @xmath2195.39 and fe  viii @xmath2195.39 contributions to the fe  vii @xmath2195.39 intrensity was negligible , at least up to 0.2 r@xmath0 .",
    "the stray light curve @xmath46 as a function of altitude ( fig .",

    "the reason for this behaviour could reside in the blending of the fe  xii @xmath2186.88 line ( which is also a blend between two fe  xii lines at @xmath2186.854 and @xmath2186.887 ) with the nearby s  xi @xmath2186.84 line , even if , as pointed out by @xcite , the contribution of the s  xi line to the fe  xii line should be negligible .    in any case , for the above reason , we were unable to derive reliable electron density measurements above that altitude with the ratio @xmath2195.12/@xmath2186.88 .",
    "unfortunately the other well detected spectral lines do not provide any other good density sensitive ratio . hence , in this work we derived the electron densities above the altitude of @xmath60 r@xmath0 with another technique .",
    "for any spectral line , the chianti spectral code allows the computation of the contribution function @xmath61 ( erg @xmath62 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8 ) , which depends on the unknown plasma electron temperature @xmath63 , density @xmath58 , and also on the unknown elemental abundance @xmath64 .",
    "given @xmath65 , the observed intensity @xmath66 of a spectral line formed by only collisional excitation can be written as @xmath67 where the integration is performed along the line of sight ( los ) . for spectral lines considered in this work the contribution from radiative",
    "excitation has been neglected , as usually done in the so - called `` coronal model approximation '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observed line intensity variations with altitude in the solar corona are due mainly to variations of @xmath58 and @xmath63 , while the elemental abundance @xmath64 is usually assumed to be constant , in first approximation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , given a pair of possible values for the average density and temperature along the los ( @xmath68 ) , the expected line intensity @xmath66 can be estimated , by assuming a thickness along the los of the emitting plasma . by comparing the line intensity observed at a fixed altitude with all the expected values @xmath66 computed for a range of possible densities and temperatures , a curve on the ( @xmath68 ) plane of allowed values can be derived .",
    "hence , from a set of intensities for different spectral lines observed at the same altitude , it is possible to perform a minimum chi - square analysis and the best ( @xmath68 ) values have been derived by minimizing the difference between the observed and computed intensities for all the spectral lines ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] ) .    in this work",

    "after a standard single gaussian fitting of the coronal line profiles , the @xmath79 values have been corrected for the instrumental profile broadening , as explained above . corrected @xmath79 values provide an estimate for the broadening due at the same time to ion kinetic temperatures and plasma motions . in the literature ,",
    "at least 2 different possible assumptions exist for the unknown quantity @xmath81 : the hypothesis of thermodynamic equilibrium ( @xmath98 ) and the hypothesis of ionization equilibrium ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties mentioned above in the estimate of @xmath63 , in this work we consider the ionization equilibrium hypothesis . by assuming ( as also done by previous authors , i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the unknown ion temperature equals the peak in the fe  xii @xmath2195.12 line emissivity as provided by the chianti spectral code ( @xmath100k ) , we estimate the broadening , @xmath59 , due only to unresolved mass motions .",
    "nevertheless , another effect needs to be taken into account . as mentioned above , the fe  xii @xmath2195.119-@xmath2195.179 blend results in a broader fe  xii @xmath2195 observed profile emitted from the disk .",
    "this implies that , for this line , opposite to what typically occurs for other spectral lines , the stray light contribution results in a broadening of the coronal line profiles , and not in a narrowing . in order to correct the fe  xii @xmath2195.12 coronal profiles for the stray light broadening",
    ", we subtracted to the observed lines a broader stray light profile with a @xmath2195.119/@xmath2195.179 line intensity ratio by 5.91 and relative total intensity given by the stray light curve derived in the previous section . in order to quantify the effect of the stray light profile subtraction , line widths",

    "this figure shows that , within the error bars provided by the fitting procedure , a general trend is observed : after the stray light correction , the fwhm progressively increases up to an altitude of @xmath3 r@xmath0 above the limb , reaching a peak value of @xmath101   , then decreases at higher altitudes down to @xmath102   .",
    "correspondingly , the estimated non - thermal velocity @xmath59 increases up to @xmath103 km s@xmath8 at 0.14 r@xmath0 above the limb , then decreases above that altitude down to @xmath104 km s@xmath8 at 0.4 r@xmath0 above the limb .",

    "we discuss the possible consequences of the working hypothesis that the unresolved plasma motions @xmath59 we observed are due to the propagation of alfvn waves along open field lines above a polar coronal hole . given the electron density and non - thermal velocity profiles derived above , it is possible to estimate the energy flux transfered into the corona by alfvn waves .",

    "if the magnetic field flux @xmath111 is conserved along opening flux tubes with cross sectional area @xmath112 carrying the alfvn waves , and if alfvn waves propagate undamped , then the total alfvn wave energy flux @xmath113 ( erg s@xmath8 ) should be a conserved quantity as the waves propagate outward .",

    "in this work we have analyzed special long duration sit & stare observations acquired by the hinode / eis spectrometer above the south polar coronal hole .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the euv coronal line profile broadening observed off - limb and to provide a reliable measurement up to @xmath24 r@xmath0 above the limb . in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , spectra acquired at different times",
    "have been averaged over the whole observation interval ( @xmath117 hours ) , and a spatial average has been also performed for spectra acquired at higher altitudes .",
    "results show that the fe  xii @xmath2195 line profile ( the strongest we detected ) progressively broadens going from the limb up to @xmath118 r@xmath0 above it , reaching a peak fwhm value of @xmath101 .",

    "[ fig01 ] ) , we were able also to study the fwhm versus altitude profile up to further distances than those ever explored by previous authors with the same instrument .",
    "our results show that above 0.14 r@xmath0 the fwhm progressively decreases down to @xmath102    at @xmath119 r@xmath0 above the limb . as we discussed in section 2.3 , the observed line width decrease above @xmath118 r@xmath0",

    "hence , as a first result , we exclude that the line width decrease observed above @xmath118 r@xmath0 with eis is an instrumental effect , and it needs to be physically explained .",
    "the main problem is that , as it is well known , the observed fwhm altitude profile is related to the altitude variation of two physical quantities ( see formula 5 ) , the ion kinetic temperatures @xmath81 and non - thermal velocities @xmath59 ( after correction for the instrumental line broadening @xmath83 along the eis slit ) , that can not be measured independently at the same time , unless some assumptions are made . hence , derived non - thermal velocities are necessarily model - dependent .    in the literature",
    ", many different assumptions have been made , hence providing in turn many different results .",
    "for instance : @xcite assumed a constant @xmath120k with altitude , in order to derive the @xmath59 profile for si@xmath121 ions ; @xcite assumed a constant @xmath59 with altitude , different for different ions , in order to derive @xmath81 as a function of the charge - to - mass ratios ; @xcite concluded that coronal ions have not a common velocity , hence non - thermal broadenings are not related to alfvn waves , but they assumed a common @xmath81 . in general ,",
    "if a common temperature is assumed for different ions , there is no common non - thermal speed , and vice - versa . in this work",
    "we were able to study the line width variation with altitude up to @xmath122 0.4 r@xmath0 only for the fe  xii @xmath2195 line , while other spectral line profiles have a much lower signal to noise ratio .",
    "non - thermal velocity profiles have been derived by assuming a constant @xmath123 at different altitudes , i.e. equal to the fe  xii @xmath2195 line maximum emissivity , as provided by the chianti spectral code . after a correction for the instrumental line broadening ,",
    "this temperature provides us a progressive non - thermal velocity @xmath59 increase with altitude above the limb up to @xmath103 km s@xmath8 at 0.14 r@xmath0 , then a decrease above that altitude down to @xmath104 km s@xmath8 at 0.4 r@xmath0 .    in this work we also derived a coronal hole electron density profile for the off - limb corona up to 0.4 r@xmath0 ( eq .",
    "4 ) with two methods : the line ratio technique and a minimum chi - square method aimed at reproducing the observed line intensity decays with altitude .",
    "the density and non - thermal velocity profiles derived led us to conclude that the alfvn wave energy flux density @xmath5 continuously decreases with altitude above the limb from @xmath115 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 at 0.03 r@xmath0 down to @xmath9 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 at 0.4 r@xmath0 , with an average decay rate by @xmath124 erg @xmath11 s@xmath8 .",
    "hence , the alfvn waves energy flux density is not conserved ( fig .  [ fig11 ] ) , not even in the lower coronal hole region where the line profile fwhm increases with altitude ( fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the disagreement with the behaviour expected for undamped alfvn waves becomes more evident at larger altitudes .",
    "in fact , in the hypothesis of undamped alfvn waves propagation , densities and non - thermal velocities should be related by @xmath125 , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "hence , given a density profile @xmath126 , it is possible to compute the corresponding non - thermal velocity profile @xmath127 that should be observed for undamped waves .",
    "three example @xmath127 curves are shown in fig .  [ fig12 ] by assuming coronal hole density profiles provided by @xcite ( dash - dotted line ) , @xcite ( dotted line ) and the density profile derived in this work ( dashed line ) .",
    "a comparison between these curves and non - thermal velocities for fe@xmath75 ( diamonds ) , fe@xmath76 ( triangles ) and fe@xmath128 ( circles ) ions measured with different techniques in a coronal hole show that , even taking into account the broad scattering of different measurements ( hence the large uncertainties ) , non - thermal velocity measurements could be in agreement with the propagation of undamped alfvn waves up to no more than @xmath129 r@xmath0 , while at higher altitudes the disagreement with this hypothesis is evident .    the total alfvn wave energy flux reported here is larger than what required to heat the quiet corona ( @xmath130 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ? * ) . nevertheless , a physical explanation for this wave dissipation is needed .",
    "for instance , @xcite demonstrated that alfvn and sound waves are decoupled for values of the plasma @xmath131 parameter @xmath132 , but become coupled when @xmath133 , allowing energy transfer from alfvn to sound waves .",
    "if this energy is transferred to sound waves above the chromopsphere , then these waves will quickly dissipate their energy in the low density corona by inducing shock waves .",
    "this could be a possible explanation for the observed alfvn wave damping : for instance following @xcite the plasma @xmath131 above an active region approaches unity around 0.2 r@xmath0 , while outside active regions can approach unity even at lower heights .",
    "alternative explanations have also been proposed .",
    "@xcite showed that , by taking into account the effect of viscosity and magnetic diffusivity in the radial propagation of alfvn waves , an alfvn wave energy flux density decrease is expected in polar coronal holes above 0.21 r@xmath0 ; this decrease is more pronounced for low frequency ( @xmath134 hz ) compared to high frequency ( @xmath135 hz ) waves .",
    "this effect was confirmed by @xcite also for the more general case of oblique propagation .",
    "we notice here that the decay obtained by @xcite for the energy flux density of alfvn waves is in qualitative agreement with our results ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) in the case of dissipation due to magnetic diffusivity alone for low frequency ( @xmath136 hz ) waves ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  2 , middle panel ) .",
    "more recent observational results demonstrate the existence of ubiquitous low frequency ( @xmath137 hz ) alfvn waves propagating throughout the quiescent atmosphere with sufficient energy to accelerate the solar wind and heat the corona @xcite and suggest that low - frequency alfvnic motions may suffer from significant damping as they propagate along magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , other theoretical works suggest that alfvn waves should propagate undamped at these low altitudes above the limb .",
    "for instance , @xcite developed a comprehensive model for the propagation of alfvn waves in a coronal hole from the photosphere to the interplanetary medium , and demonstrate that the frequency - integrated velocity amplitude should increase monotonically with height from the chromosphere up to 10 r@xmath0 . in the present work we demonstrate that the fwhm decay of euv lines ( reported also by previous authors ) can not be simply ascribed to instrumental effects ( i.e. stray light ) . in principle , alternative physical explanations for this observational effect , other than the damping of alfvn waves , could be proposed . but a challenge remains to understand how to explain on the one hand the non - thermal velocity decay of heavy ions reported here in the euv low coronal emission ( @xmath138 r@xmath0 ) , and on the other hand the very large non - thermal velocities of heavy ions discovered in the uv spectra emitted by the intermediate and extended corona ( @xmath139 r@xmath0 ; see review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "<S> between february 24 - 25 , 2009 , the eis spectrometer onboard the hinode spacecraft performed special `` sit & stare '' observations above the south polar coronal hole continuously over more than 22 hours . </S>",
    "<S> spectra were acquired with the 1  slit placed off - limb covering altitudes up to 0.48 r@xmath0 ( @xmath1 mm ) above the sun surface , in order to study with eis the non - thermal spectral line broadenings . </S>",
    "<S> spectral lines such as fe  xii @xmath2186.88 , fe  xii @xmath2193.51 , fe  xii @xmath2195.12 and fe  xiii @xmath2202.04 are observed with good statistics up to high altitudes and they have been analyzed in this study . </S>",
    "<S> results show that the fwhm of fe  xii @xmath2195.12 line increases up to @xmath3 r@xmath0 , then decreases higher up . </S>",
    "<S> eis stray light has been estimated and removed . </S>",
    "<S> derived electron density and non - thermal velocity profiles have been used to estimate the total energy flux transported by alfvn waves off - limb in polar coronal hole up to @xmath4 r@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the computed alfvn wave energy flux density @xmath5 progressively decays with altitude from @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 at 0.03 r@xmath0 down to @xmath9 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 at 0.4 r@xmath0 , with an average energy decay rate @xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this result suggests energy deposition by alfvn waves in a polar coronal hole , thus providing a significant source for coronal heating . </S>"
