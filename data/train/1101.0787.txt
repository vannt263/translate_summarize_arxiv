    "the ua5 collaboration noticed for the first time that charged - particle multiplicity distributions measured in high energy proton-(anti)proton collisions in limited intervals of pseudo - rapidity have the negative binomial form @xcite . in the present paper this observation will be verified for the collisions at @xmath0 = 0.9 and 2.36 tev performed by ua5 @xcite and alice collaborations @xcite . only non - single diffractive ( nsd ) events will be considered because such a case was analyzed with this respect by both collaborations .",
    "in fact , the author investigated alice inelastic events also ( including the case of @xmath0 = 7 tev @xcite ) , but all fits were entirely unacceptable .",
    "the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) is defined as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a positive real number . in the application to high energy physics",
    "@xmath5 has the meaning of the number of charged particles detected in an event .",
    "the expected value @xmath6 and variance @xmath7 and the variance @xmath8 . [ przyp1 ] ] are expressed as :    @xmath9    in this analysis the hypothesis that the charged - particle multiplicities measured in high energy @xmath10 collisions are distributed according to the nbd is verified with the use of the maximum likelihood method ( ml ) and the likelihood ratio test .",
    "more details of this approach can be found in refs .  .",
    "there are two crucial reasons for this approach :    the fitted quantity is a probability distribution function ( p.d.f . ) , so the most natural way is to use the ml method , where the likelihood function is constructed directly from the tested p.d.f .. but more important is that because of wilks s theorem ( see appendix b ) one can easily define a statistic , the distribution of which converges to a @xmath11 distribution as the number of measurements goes to infinity .",
    "thus for the large sample the goodness - of - fit can be expressed as a @xmath12-value computed with the corresponding @xmath11 distribution .",
    "the most commonly used method , the least - squares method ( ls ) ( called also @xmath11 minimization ) , has the disadvantage of providing only the qualitative measure of the significance of the fit , in general . only if observables are represented by gaussian random variables with known variances , the conclusion about the goodness - of - fit equivalent to that mentioned in the point ( i )",
    "can be derived @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the ml method with binned data and poisson fluctuations within a bin was already applied to fitting multiplicity distributions to the nbd but at much lower energies ( e-802 collaboration @xcite ) .",
    "the number of charged particles @xmath13 is assumed to be a random variable with the p.d.f . given by eq .",
    "( [ nbdist ] ) .",
    "each event is treated as an independent observation of @xmath13 and a set of a given class of events is a sample . for @xmath14 events in the class",
    "there are @xmath14 measurements of @xmath13 , say @xmath15",
    ". some of these measurements can be equal , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 for @xmath17 can happen .",
    "the whole population consists of all possible events with the measurements of 0 , 1 , 2 , ... charged particles and by definition is infinite . ]    for the class of events one can defined the likelihood function    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the nbd , eq .",
    "( [ nbdist ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath20 and @xmath21 for which @xmath22 has its maximum are the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "this is equivalent to the maximization of the log - likelihood function    @xmath23    thus the values @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the solutions of the equations :    @xmath24 @xmath25    it can be proven that one of the necessary conditions for the existence of the maximum is ( see appendix a for details ) :    @xmath26    _ i.e. _ the distribution average has to be equal to the experimental average .",
    "let divide the sample defined in sect .",
    "[ likmeth ] into @xmath27 bins characterized by @xmath28 - the number of measured charged particles for @xmath17 and @xmath29 .",
    "[ przyp3 ] ] and @xmath30 - the number of entries in the @xmath31th bin , @xmath32 ( details of the theoretical framework of this section can be found in refs .   ) .",
    "then the expectation value of the number of events in the @xmath31th bin can be written as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the expected number of all events in the sample , @xmath35 .",
    "this is because one can treat the number of events in the sample @xmath14 also as a random variable with its own distribution - poisson one .",
    "generally , the whole histogram can be treated as one measurement of @xmath27-dimensional random vector @xmath36 which has a multinomial distribution , so the joint p.d.f . for the measurement of @xmath14 and @xmath37",
    "can be converted to the form @xcite :    @xmath38    since now @xmath39 is the p.d.f . for one measurement , @xmath40 is also the likelihood function    @xmath41    with the use of eq .",
    "( [ neventi ] ) the corresponding likelihood function can be written as    @xmath42    then the likelihood ratio is defined as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the ml estimates of @xmath34 , @xmath12 and @xmath4 with the likelihood function given by eq .",
    "( [ liksubset ] ) and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the ml estimates of @xmath47 treated as free parameters .",
    "note that since the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ likeliratio ] ) does not depend on parameters , the log - ratio defined as    @xmath48    where @xmath47 are expressed by eq .",
    "( [ neventi ] ) , can be used to find the ml estimates of @xmath34 , @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "further , the statistic given by    @xmath49    approaches the @xmath11 distribution asymptotically , _",
    "i.e. _ as the number of measurements , here the number of events @xmath14 , goes to infinity ( the consequence of the wilks s theorem , see appendix b ) .",
    "the values @xmath50 are the estimates of @xmath47 given by    @xmath51    and if one assumes that @xmath34 does not depend on @xmath12 and @xmath4 then @xmath52 .",
    "for such a case    @xmath53    and eq .  ( [ poissonchi ] ) becomes    @xmath54    also then one can just put @xmath55 and eq .",
    "( [ logratio ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath56    with the term depending on @xmath12 and @xmath4 the same as eq .",
    "( [ loglikfubi ] ) and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore conclusions of appendix a holds here , _",
    "i.e. _ the necessary conditions for the existence of the maximum is @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ dloglikfk ] ) is the equation which determines @xmath21 and @xmath20 is obtained with the help of eq .",
    "( [ oneoverp ] ) .",
    "note that the maximum of @xmath59 is the minimum of @xmath60 , so from eqs .",
    "( [ multinomchi ] ) and ( [ logratfreq ] ) one arrives at    @xmath61    in fact , the method just described assumes that the sum of @xmath62 over all bins equals 1 .",
    "but only the infinite sum of @xmath63 is 1 .",
    "however the measured values of @xmath64 are big enough ( of the order of 20 at least for all considered cases ) so in the vicinity of @xmath20 and @xmath21 the sum of @xmath63 up to @xmath65 equals 1 approximately ( see the seventh column in table  [ table1 ] ) . nevertheless , to calculate @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( [ finalchi ] ) , @xmath67 were normalized appropriately and these results are listed in the fifth column of tables  [ table1]-[table3 ] . another way to treat",
    "this problem is to create arbitrary the @xmath68st bin for all possible @xmath69 and with @xmath70 .",
    "bins with @xmath71 ( @xmath72 equivalently ) do not contribute in eq .",
    "( [ finalchi ] ) ( see ref .  ) . in practice , it means that @xmath66 would be calculated also from eq .",
    "( [ finalchi ] ) but without the normalization .",
    "it has turned out that that way leads to much greater values of @xmath66 .",
    "the method described in sections  [ likmeth ] and [ liktest ] requires that all bins in a given data set have the width equal to 1 , so as the experimental probability @xmath73 to measure a signal in the @xmath31th bin was equivalent to the probability of the measurement of @xmath74 charged particles ( the first bin is the bin of 0 charged particles detected ) .",
    "this is fulfilled for all bins of the considered data sets except the ends of their tails . in these tails",
    "the measured values of @xmath73 have been uniformly distributed over the bin range so as the method could be applied directly .",
    "if the bin width is not significantly greater than 1 then this approximation should not change substantially the value of @xmath66 given by eq .",
    "( [ finalchi ] ) because in the most cases @xmath73 at tails are two orders smaller than in the main part of distributions .",
    "also errors in tails are bigger , in the range @xmath75 , increasing with @xmath31 .",
    "since the test statistic @xmath76 has a @xmath77 distribution approximately in the large sample limit , it can be used as a test of the goodness - of - fit .",
    "the result of the test is given by the so - called @xmath12-value which is the probability of obtaining the value of the statistic , eq .",
    "( [ poissonchi ] ) , equal to or greater then the value just obtained by the ml method for the present data set , when repeating the whole experiment many times :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the @xmath77 p.d.f . and @xmath80 the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath81 here .",
