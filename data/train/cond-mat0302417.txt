    "v. g. veselago studied in sixties @xcite the electromagnetic properties of materials whose permittivity and permeability have negative real parts simultaneously .",
    "he showed that these media exhibit unusual effects like anomalous negative refraction of electromagnetic waves and existence of backward waves ( when the group velocity and the poynting vector are directed opposite with respect to the phase velocity ) .",
    "this concept implies many other interesting features of wave propagation that were reviewed in @xcite .",
    "these _ veselago _ media do not exist in nature .",
    "the interest in creating such media artificially , for optical applications , has been indicated by j. pendry in @xcite .",
    "this kind of medium can be obtained with arrays of conducting inclusions of a special shape .",
    "it is obvious that the response of these materials will be resonant .",
    "therefore , negative refraction is possible only within a more or less narrow frequency band ( or bands ) @xcite .",
    "this `` negative '' band can be a part of a resonant band of inclusions that are used in the composite .",
    "this is quite clear analyzing the lorentz model of the resonant dispersion .    at this stage of studies , since it is easier to use resonant inclusions with millimeter dimensions , it seems to be reasonable to focus on applications for the microwave region of the spectrum ( optic composites will need micrometer particles ) and to study their response experimentally . how to prepare these composites in a best way ?",
    "which shape of inclusions is more suitable ?",
    "these are the general questions addressed by this article .",
    "works that have theoretically predicted negative permittivity for composite media have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "however , publications containing the same results for the permeability are not so common . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was indicated that it was a very difficult problem to obtain a magnetic resonant response of inclusions ( in order to get a negative real part of @xmath0 ) . probably , it was the reason for which these authors have chosen a rather complicated particle named as _ split - ring resonator ( srr ) _ , see fig .",
    "they maintained in these works , that srr has only a resonant magnetic polarizability and no resonant electric one .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that to obtain negative permittivity simultaneously with negative permeability .",
    "srr inclusions must be combined with a lattice of straight wires .",
    "this complex system is a very cumbersome technical solution .",
    "the only special case where wave propagates normally to the wires ( which corresponds to @xcite ) is suitable to observe the negative refraction in such a structure .",
    "it is clear that the structures from @xcite can not be considered as an _ isotropic _ backward - wave composite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the srr particles alone allow to obtain simultaneously negative permeability and permittivity . indeed",
    ", these inclusions also possess a resonant electric polarizability that has not been discovered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also point out that the analytical model of srr suggested in @xcite does not give a satisfactory explanation of the frequency behavior of effective permeability .",
    "moreover , it is possible to realize an _ isotropic _",
    "composite with negative refraction choosing properly the geometry , arrangement and concentration of srr particles in a host dielectric matrix .",
    "however , we have found that srr is not the best choice for obtaining a backward - wave medium at microwaves .",
    "actually , the resonant electric response of srr is weaker than the magnetic one .",
    "we show that it is better to use an inclusion known as omega particle ( or @xmath1-shaped conducting particle ) suggested in 1992 by saadoum and engheta @xcite since its magnetic and electric responses of are of the same order .",
    "numerical and analytical modeling of omega particles have been recently made in @xcite-@xcite and the properties of uniaxial and planar omega composite media have been derived .",
    "it appears that these media are prospective for creating low - reflecting shields and antenna radomes in microwave applications . with this kind of objectives , in 1995 - 1996 , we studied theoretically uniaxial omega composites and noticed that sometimes the real parts of both permittivity and permeability became negative , especially in the cases with high densities of particles .",
    "thus , as it was not suitable for our goals , the experimental samples of omega composites which were prepared under guidance of s.a .",
    "tretyakov @xcite were dilute mixtures in order to avoid the apparition of negative properties .",
    "negative permittivity and permeability of omega composites has been predicted in the paper @xcite .",
    "however , the model of the material parameters presented in this work and based on the transmission - line model of omega particle was contradictory ( particle size was taken of the order @xmath2 but the constitutive relations were introduced as if the composites were continuous media ) and violated some physical foundations ( kramers - kronig relations , etc ) .    in the following we consider the effective properties of isotropic composites of both omega and srr particles embedded in a dielectric host medium .",
    "we study two different kinds of particles arrangement .",
    "the first one is a mixture with a random orientations of particles .",
    "the second one is obtained by positioning the particles at the sides of a cubic unit cell , like it is shown in figs [ fig11 ] and [ fig33 ] .",
    "different inclusions and structures are finally compared .",
    "both srr particles and omega particles are bianisotropic particles . in other words ,",
    "an external electric field produces a magnetic dipole in the particle and , at the same time , an external magnetic field produces an electric dipole . for srr , this magnetoelectric effect is reduced by choosing the opposite positioning of the splits of both loops",
    ". however , it can not cancel out exactly since the loops are of different sizes .",
    "let a srr particle be located in an infinite and homogeneous dielectric medium with permittivity @xmath3 .",
    "consider the electromagnetic response of an individual srr particle to local magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the polarizabilities of a srr particle are dyadic coefficients relating the local electric and magnetic fields @xmath4 with the induced electric and magnetic dipole moments : @xmath5    the electric and magnetic moments of the srr as a whole are vector sum of the moments induced in the outer and inner loops ( indices 1 and 2 , respectively ) : @xmath6 in this section we evaluate analytically the polarizabilities of a srr particle , assuming that the inclusion is fabricated from a round wire of radius @xmath7 . the section of the wire is small enough to satisfy the inequality @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the averaged radiuses of rings 1 and 2 ( see fig . [",
    "distance @xmath10 between the broken ends of each ring is assumed to be small compared to @xmath9 .",
    "the analytical model of the omega particle will not be reproduced here . analytical antenna theory and its verification",
    "can be found in @xcite .    finally , using the calculated polarizabilities we derive for each kind of particles the material parameters through the well - known maxwell garnett model .",
    "we consider the srr particle as a pair of two mutually coupled resonant scatterers .",
    "the complex amplitudes of induced currents at the splits of both rings can be written as follows : @xmath11 indices 1 and 2 refer to the outer and inner ring respectively . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electromotive forces induced by the external fields .",
    "@xmath14 are the currents at the splits of the rings .",
    "@xmath15 represent the inductive loop impedances ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 are the capacitive impedance ( @xmath18 ) of the slits . for a magnetic field",
    "excitation we can neglect the individual loop capacitance which has only a small influence . for the study of electric polarization , influence of the proper capacitance of one loop must be taken into account . for",
    "that we use the known theory of a split loop antenna @xcite and @xcite which takes into account the capacitive properties of an individual loop scatterer and its radiation losses .",
    "@xmath19 in , is the mutual impedance of broken loops .",
    "we have chosen to include directly the capacitive mutual coupling in the term @xmath20 .",
    "otherwise the analytical model of mutual coupling would become too involved . with these considerations the mutual impedance @xmath19 in ,",
    "is expressed only as a mutual inductance @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the capacitances @xmath20 are composed of two contributions . the first part @xmath23 originates from the splits of each loop .",
    "the second one is due to capacitive coupling of loops and can be seen as a consequence of the following effect .",
    "consider first as a reference the conductor of one loop ( the outer loop of a srr particle , for example ) .",
    "next , place another conductor parallel to the first one ( in our case , the inner loop , with the split at the opposite side ) .",
    "then , assume that one half of the first loop ( e.g. the upper part ) contains positive charge @xmath24 , and the second half of the first loop ( e.g. the lower part ) contains negative charge @xmath25 .",
    "these charges are distributed somehow along the loop perimeter . as the two loops are positioned closely , in the upper half of the second loop , a negative charge @xmath26",
    "is induced .",
    "hence , the distribution of the global charge @xmath26 around the second loop repeats the distribution of @xmath24 in the first loop .",
    "note that we do not have necessarily the correspondence @xmath27 .",
    "of course , the same thing happens in the lower part of the structure , where the induced charge @xmath28 appears .",
    "so two equivalent capacitances @xmath29 arise from this situation as shown in fig .",
    "hence , we obtain an effective additional capacitance which is equal to @xmath30 , connected in parallel to the proper capacitance of the split .",
    "one can note that this equivalent scheme can be improved taking into account that there is an additional capacitance of the second slit .",
    "however , we are trying to derive a model of srr as simple as possible and the complexity , increased by this additional capacitance , is not justified .",
    "values of inductances @xmath31 , mutual inductance @xmath21 and total capacitances @xmath20 are analytically calculated in appendix .    to obtain the eigenfrequencies of the srr particle ,",
    "we let the right - hand side of , vanish and equate the determinant to zero : @xmath32 equation can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 are small resistances that represent the radiation and the joule losses of both loops .",
    "they lead to a small imaginary correction term denoted as @xmath35 in equation : @xmath36 if we assume that the srr particle is perfectly conducting , the term @xmath37 describes only the radiation losses of a magnetic dipole and it can be derived from the energy balance condition , as it was done in @xcite for arbitrary dipole scatterers . comparing with",
    "we find the eigenfrequencies : @xmath38 where we denote @xmath39    frequencies correspond to two eigenmodes .",
    "if the frequencies @xmath40 and @xmath41 differ dramatically the two eigenmodes of the induced current are excited at different frequencies .",
    "this leads to two separate resonances ( that magnetic and that electric ones ) of the particle .",
    "however , we will see below that in practical cases @xmath42 .",
    "the two resonance bands overlap , and we obtain a result close to that of the lorentz model with only one resonance , as it goes for simple scatterers . as a consequence , it matches qualitatively the results of @xcite .",
    "next , we are going to derive the polarizabilities of srr particle using , and definitions and .",
    "first , we study the magnetic polarizability . for a magnetic excitation ( @xmath43 , where the @xmath44-axis is perpendicular to the loop plane as it is shown in fig .",

    ".    the only component of the magnetic moment is vertical , i.e. @xmath47    then , relations together with - and - lead to the following expression : @xmath48 where we have denoted @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 now let us find the term @xmath37 .",

    "the only electro - dipole mode of the current is excited in both loops in this case .",
    "the induced charges are concentrated at the splits and at the opposite points and the polarizability component @xmath57 is quasi - static . it does not depend on the presence or absence of the split and equations , are useless in this case and the electromotive force @xmath13 induced at the split is also equal to zero : charges are the same at the edges of each split . ] .    in @xcite we derived formula ( 28 ) for @xmath58component of the polarizability of a circular loop with area @xmath59 .",
    "denoting this polarizability as @xmath60 we obtain from @xcite : @xmath61 in this equation , @xmath62 is the wave impedance of the host medium , @xmath63 is the wave number in the medium , @xmath64 is the derivative of the bessel function of the first order , @xmath65 is one of so - called king s coefficient known from the theory of loop antennas @xcite,@xcite .",
    "king s coefficients with a very high accuracy are approximated in @xcite and take the following form : @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70    since we have two loops , we must sum up their @xmath60 to obtain the result : @xmath71 now we consider the case where the electric field is directed along @xmath72axis . here",
    "the resonant electric polarization appears in both loops of the srr particle . to obtain the resulting polarizability",

    "@xmath81 , we can say that it is composed of the proper impedance of the loop @xmath82 and of the additional impedance @xmath83 , which is the contribution of loop @xmath84 into loop @xmath81 . then , for loop",

    "its value is given by formula ( 26 ) from @xcite : @xmath99 substituting the values @xmath9 and @xmath7 into and allows to calculate the electromotive forces induced by an external electric field in each loop of the srr particle .",
    "then , substituting expressions of @xmath100 into with the help of relation we can find @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , we derive an expression of @xmath80 which is then substituted into and .",
    "finally , we evaluate @xmath101 as the sum @xmath102    at this point , we have at our disposal a complete analytical model of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of an individual srr particle ( other components of @xmath103 and @xmath104 are zeros ) .      an isotropic mixture with a random orientation of particles can be considered as a mixture realised with isotropic particles which have averaged scalar polarizabilities @xcite : @xmath105 here we have designated cartesian components with index @xmath106 .",
    "the particles under consideration do not have cross components : @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , we have seen with our analytical model , that the only polarizabilities that are non - zero are : @xmath109 and @xmath53 .    if srr or omega particles are arranged on the sides of cubic unit cells ( see figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig33 ] ) , the magnetoelectric effect also disappears and dyadics @xmath110 of the individual particles do not contribute into material parameters .",
    "furthermore , mutual coupling of six particles belonging to the same cell is weak enough if the cell size @xmath111 is a bit more than the particle size @xmath112 ( the particles do not touch one another ) .",
    "now , let us evaluate the equivalent effective polarizability of each kind of unit cell ignoring the mutual coupling between the particles of a cubic cell .",

    "consider now the magnetic field effect on the cell .",
    "a magnetic field directed along an arbitrary edge of a cell induces two equivalent magnetic moments in two opposite particles .",
    "so , the magnetic polarizability of a unit cell turns out to be the double of @xmath53 .    to summarize , the cubic unit cell is equivalent to an isotropic particle with electric and magnetic polarizabilities given by @xmath114      for a unit cubic cell of omega particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig33 ] ) the situation is quite different . here",
    "the resonant excitation by the electric field directed along the arms of @xmath1 ( along @xmath115-axis in the model of an individual particle ) is mainly due to the presence of the arms @xcite .",

    "inductance of a round loop of radius @xmath161 made with a wire of cross section radius @xmath7 can be found e.g. in @xcite : @xmath162 inductances of both rings of srr can be obtained with with the substitution @xmath163 .",

    "we have neglected the terms of order @xmath168 .",
    "now , consider the capacitances included in the loops splits .",
    "we can write in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xmath169 for @xmath170 we have the simple equation of a conventional ( parallel - plate ) capacitor @xmath171 if the split width @xmath10 is much smaller than the wire cross section diameter . otherwise , if @xmath172 one has @xmath173 and the capacitance of the split can be ignored .",
    "we do not study the cases when @xmath174 .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath29 . the capacitance per unit length of two parallel wires of diameter @xmath175 with the distance between the wire axes @xmath176 denoted below as @xmath177 is known @xcite : @xmath178 roughly ( but successfully ) we can consider @xmath29 as the capacitance between two equivalent parallel straight wires of length @xmath179 with distance @xmath180 between their axes .",
    "however , we would obtain a bad result if we simply multiply @xmath177 by @xmath181 in order to find @xmath29 .",
    "we should take into account the non - uniformity of the charge distribution along these equivalent wires and then write @xmath182 ( where the effective length of two parallel charged wires @xmath183 is smaller than @xmath181 due to this non - uniformity )",
    ".    we use the king theory of loop antennas @xcite in order to find effective length @xmath183 . for it",
    "we write the fourier expansion for the current induced in the reference loop by a magnetic field ( with respect to the azimuth angle @xmath184 ) : @xmath185 it corresponds to the following expansion for the induced charges per unit angle : @xmath186 in the king theory it was proven that ( for the case of small loop antenna ( @xmath187 ) with a finite impedance of the split ) the omitted terms in expansions and are of the next order of smallness compared to the remained terms @xcite .",
    "the uniform term @xmath188 represents the magneto - dipole mode of the induced current and has nothing to do with induced charges .",
    "two other terms in are responsible for the electric polarization of the loop and are related with the charge distribution .",
    "we can rewrite as : @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "so , at it was already mentioned , half of the loop ( @xmath191 ) contains positive charge @xmath192 , and the other half ( @xmath193 ) contains negative charge @xmath25 .",
    "the distribution of these charges is sinusoidal .",
    "the induced charges in the other loop have the opposite sign but the same sinusoidal distribution ( see also fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we obtain that the distribution of the charge along two effective equivalent parallel wires of length @xmath181 is sinusoidal with zeros at the ends of these wires .",
    "it leads to the result @xmath194 which gives together with the approximate relation for the capacitance @xmath29 : @xmath195 if the loop is excited by @xmath72polarized electric field , the formula of the current distribution keeps valid @xcite .",
    "coefficients @xmath196 change in this case , but the charges @xmath24 and @xmath25 remain sinusoidally distributed on the two halves of each the loop .",
    "therefore the formula keeps valid , too ."
