    "a number of modified gravity theories have been proposed so far as alternatives to dark energy  @xcite .",
    "such theories are typically described by scalar - tensor gravity , in which a scalar propagating degree of freedom is introduced in addition to the gravitational wave ones .",
    "a single scalar and two tensor modes imply that equations of motion for the scalar field and the metric are of second order . the horndeski theory of gravity  @xcite",
    ", the most general scalar - tensor theory with second - order field equations , is therefore quite useful for a comprehensive study of modified gravity .",
    "recently , it has been noticed that the horndeski theory can be generalized without introducing any degrees of freedom other than the single scalar and two tensor modes  @xcite .",
    "going beyond the horndeski class , one inevitably obtains higher order field equations since the horndeski lagrangian has been proven to be the most general one with second - order field equations . the trick is to introduce a preferred time slicing on which the necessary number of initial conditions remains the same as that of the horndeski theory .",
    "the preferred slicing is given by the unitary gauge in which the scalar field @xmath1 is spatially homogeneous , and away from the unitary gauge the field equations are of higher order in general .",
    "one can thus obtain a more general framework to study modified gravity based on scalar - tensor theories beyond horndeski .",
    "aspects of scalar - tensor theories beyond horndeski have been investigated in refs .  @xcite . for a further generalization of the work of  @xcite , see refs .",

    "e.g. _ , by the solar - system tests . a screening mechanism for the scalar force on small scales is therefore required to be incorporated in modified gravity .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism  @xcite is one such screening mechanism that operates in theories possessing second derivatives of the scalar in the lagrangian .",
    "the galileons  @xcite , dgp gravity  @xcite , and massive gravity  @xcite are known to exhibit vainshtein screening in the vicinity of a gravitational source  @xcite .",
    "the original horndeski lagrangian can be written equivalently in the form of the generalized galileon  @xcite , and this galileon - like structure allows us to study the vainshtein mechanism in a generic manner .",
    "several works have been carried out along this direction : the generic conditions for the vainshtein mechanism to work were derived and some observational implications were suggested in  @xcite , and the stability of the screened solutions was discussed in  @xcite .",
