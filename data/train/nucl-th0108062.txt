    "the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction is an ideal testing ground for studying the importance of su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking in hadronic systems .",
    "existing meson exchange models of the @xmath4 force usually assume su(3 ) flavor symmetry for the hadronic coupling constants , and in some cases @xcite even the su(6 ) symmetry of the quark model .",
    "the symmetry requirements provide relations between couplings of mesons of a given multiplet to the baryon current , which greatly reduce the number of free model parameters .",
    "specifically , coupling constants at the strange vertices are connected to nucleon - nucleon - meson coupling constants , which in turn are constrained by the wealth of empirical information on @xmath5 scattering .",
    "essentially all @xmath4 interaction models can reproduce the existing @xmath4 scattering data , so that at present the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry for the coupling constants can not be ruled out by experiment .",
    "one should note , however , that the various models differ dramatically in their treatment of the scalar - isoscalar meson sector , which describes the baryon - baryon interaction at intermediate ranges .",
    "for example , in the nijmegen models @xcite this interaction is generated by the exchange of a genuine scalar meson su(3 ) nonet .",
    "the tbingen model @xcite , on the other hand , which is essentially a constituent quark model supplemented by @xmath6 and @xmath2 exchange at intermediate and short ranges , treats the @xmath2 meson as an su(3 ) singlet .    in the @xmath4 models of the jlich group @xcite",
    "the @xmath2 ( with a mass of @xmath7  mev ) is viewed as arising from correlated @xmath8 exchange . a rough estimate for the ratios of the @xmath2-coupling strengths in the various channels",
    "can then be obtained from the relevant pion couplings . in practice , however , in the jlich @xmath4 models , which start from the bonn @xmath5 potential , the coupling constants of the fictitious @xmath2 meson at the strange vertices ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) are free parameters  a rather unsatisfactory feature of the models .",
    "these problems can be overcome by an explicit evaluation of correlated @xmath8 exchange in the various baryon - baryon channels .",
    "a corresponding calculation was already performed for the @xmath5 case in ref .",
    "the starting point there was a field theoretic model for both the @xmath11 born amplitudes and the @xmath8 and @xmath12 elastic scattering  @xcite . with the help of unitarity and dispersion relations ,",
    "the amplitude for the correlated @xmath8 exchange in the @xmath5 interaction was computed , showing characteristic differences compared with the @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange in the ( full ) bonn potential .    in a recent study @xcite",
    "the jlich group presented a microscopic derivation of correlated @xmath8 exchange in various baryon - baryon ( @xmath13 ) channels with strangeness @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath12 channel was treated on an equal footing with the @xmath8 channel in order to reliably determine the influence of @xmath12 correlations in the relevant @xmath16-channels . in this approach",
    "one can replace the phenomenological @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchanges in the bonn @xmath5 @xcite and jlich @xmath4 @xcite models by correlated processes , and eliminate undetermined parameters such as the @xmath17 coupling constants . as a first application of the full model @xcite for correlated @xmath8 and @xmath18 exchange , we present here new results for @xmath4 cross sections for various @xmath4 channels , and compare them with the available data .",
    "alternative approaches to describing baryon - baryon interactions using effective field theory , based on chiral power counting schemes , have recently been applied to the @xmath5 interaction . however , at present a quantitative description of @xmath5 scattering within a consistent power counting scheme is still problematic @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear that such a description can be applied in the strangeness sector , where the expansion parameter , @xmath19 , may no longer be small enough to allow an accurate low order truncation .",
    "in addition , contact terms , which parameterize the intermediate and short range interaction , do not fulfill any su(3 ) relations , and can not be fixed by currently available @xmath4 data . at present , therefore , to obtain a quantitative description of @xmath4 scattering data over a large energy range one is forced towards a more traditional approach , such as that adopted here .",
    "let us briefly describe the dynamical model @xcite for correlated two - pion and two - kaon exchange in the baryon - baryon interaction , both in the scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath2 ) and vector - isovector ( @xmath3 ) channels .",
    "the contribution of correlated @xmath8 and @xmath21 exchange is derived from the amplitudes for the transition of a baryon - antibaryon state ( @xmath22 ) to a @xmath8 or @xmath21 state in the pseudophysical region by applying dispersion theory and unitarity . for the @xmath23",
    ", @xmath12 amplitudes a microscopic model is constructed , which is based on the hadron exchange picture .",
    "the born terms include contributions from baryon exchange as well as @xmath3-pole diagrams ( cf . ref .",
    "the correlations between the two pseudoscalar mesons are taken into account by means of a coupled channel ( @xmath8 , @xmath12 ) model @xcite generated from @xmath24- and @xmath16-channel meson exchange born terms .",
    "this model describes the empirical @xmath8 phase shifts over a large energy range from threshold up to 1.3 gev .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath23 , @xmath12 model , which are interrelated through su(3 ) symmetry , are determined by fitting to the quasiempirical @xmath25 amplitudes in the pseudophysical region , @xmath26 @xcite , obtained by analytic continuation of the empirical @xmath27 and @xmath8 data .    from the @xmath28 helicity",
    "amplitudes one can calculate the corresponding spectral functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , which are then inserted into dispersion integrals to obtain the ( on - shell ) baryon - baryon interaction in the @xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath30 ) channels : @xmath31 note that the spectral functions characterize both the strength and range of the interaction . for the exchange of an infinitely narrow meson",
    "the spectral function becomes a @xmath32-function at the appropriate mass .",
    "as shown by reuber et al .",
    "@xcite , the strength of the correlated @xmath8 and @xmath12 in the @xmath2 channel exchange decreases as the strangeness of the baryon - baryon channels becomes more negative .",
    "for example , in the hyperon - nucleon systems ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) the scalar - isoscalar part of the correlated exchanges is about a factor of 2 weaker than in the @xmath5 channel , and , in particular , is also weaker than the phenomenological @xmath2 meson exchange used in the original jlich @xmath4 model  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we expect that the microscopic model with correlated @xmath8 exchange will lead to a @xmath4 interaction which is less attractive .",
    "besides replacing the conventional @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchanges by correlated @xmath8 and @xmath12 exchange , there are in addition several new ingredients in the present @xmath4 model .",
    "first of all , we now take into account contributions from @xmath33 exchange .",
    "the @xmath34 meson is present in the original bonn @xmath5 potential @xcite , and for consistency should also be included in the @xmath4 model .",
    "secondly , we consider the exchange of a strange scalar meson , the @xmath35 , with mass @xmath36  mev .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that these particles are not viewed as being members of a scalar meson su(3 ) multiplet , but rather as representations of strong meson - meson correlations in the scalar ",
    "isovector ( @xmath37@xmath21 ) @xcite and scalar  isospin-1/2 ( @xmath38 ) channels , respectively . in principle , their contributions can also be evaluated along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , for simplicity in the present model they are effectively parameterized by one boson exchange diagrams with the appropriate quantum numbers . in any case , these phenomenological pieces are of rather short range , and do not modify the long range part of the @xmath4 interaction , which is determined solely by su(6 ) constraints ( for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons ) and by correlated @xmath8 and @xmath21 exchange .    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the integrated cross sections for the new @xmath4 potential ( solid curves ) with the @xmath39 scattering data as a function of the laboratory momentum , @xmath40 .",
    "the agreement between the predictions and the data @xcite is clearly excellent in all channels . also shown are the predictions from the original jlich @xmath4 model  a @xcite ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the main qualitative differences between the two models appear in the @xmath41 channel , for which the jlich model @xcite ( with standard @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange ) predicts a broad shoulder at @xmath42 350 mev / c .",
    "this structure , which is not supported by the available experimental evidence , is due to a bound state in the @xmath43 partial wave of the @xmath1 channel .",
    "it is not present in the new model .",
    "the agreement in the other channels is equally good , if not better , for the new model .",
