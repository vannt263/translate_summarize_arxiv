    "the vacuum speed of light may be a function of photon energy . even a very small such dependence might yield energy - dependent time delays which , over the long journeys from distant astronomical sources , may accumulate to a level measurable by the fermi gamma ray space telescope  @xcite .",
    "the expectation from general considerations @xcite is that the scale of the effect is linear in the photon s energy : @xmath0 where the planck energy is @xmath1 this relation gives delays over astronomical distances of seconds ( gev energies ) to hours ( tev energies ) .",
    "a motivation for this suggestion is the possibility that space - time may be lumpy , fuzzy , or even discrete , on small scales , and that this lumpiness may affect photon propagation in a dispersive way .",
    "we adopt the extreme viewpoint provided by _ causal set theory _ , an approach to quantum gravity pioneered by rafael sorkin @xcite , with the founding principle that spacetime is a _ partially ordered _ set of purely discrete points .",
    "the partial order nicely reflects the causal relationships between events fundamental to special relativity .",
    "we also adopt the feynman sum - over - histories quantum electrodynamics , which is greatly simplified by the postulated discreteness : path integrals , and the difficulties associated with divergences and defining the measure on the space of all paths are replaced by discrete sums .",
    "causal set ( cs ) theory postulates that at very small scales  below those of ordinary experience , and even below the smallest scales accessible to particle physics experiments  space - time consists of a set of discrete points .",
    "the usual space - time continuum is thus regarded as a macroscopic construct that does not exist .",
    "one only requires that the large scale limit of the cs  recovers known , macroscopic , continuum physics .    in mathematical terms ,",
    "causal set _ is a pair ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3   is a set and @xmath4 is a binary relation on @xmath3  satisfying the following properties ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 etc .",
    "are general points in @xmath3 ) :    1 .",
    "* partial order : * some , but not all , pairs @xmath8 of points are ordered : @xmath9 ; 2 .   * transitivity : * if @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then @xmath11 ; 3 .",
    "* anti - reflexivity : * no point is related to itself : @xmath12 ; 4 .",
    "* local finiteness : * for all @xmath13 @xmath3 , the set @xmath14 = \\ { z \\in $ ] @xmath3@xmath15 is finite .",
    "the first two items are consistent with , and are taken to express , the causal relations of special relativity : @xmath9 ( read `` @xmath5 precedes @xmath6 '' ) means that @xmath6 is in the forward light - cone of @xmath5 , and can affect @xmath5 . if separated by a space - like interval @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not ordered .",
    "transitivity here simply expresses the relation between nested light cones .",
    "one consequence of the above ansatz is that all space - time information is contained in the causal connections among the points .",
    "for example , any topological or metric notions must be extracted from the discrete ( i.e. , combinatorial ) structure of ( @xmath3 , @xmath16 @xcite , without any reference to a continuum .",
    "this also means that the action ( see below ) for the step @xmath17 can depend on only the causal relation between the two points , plus the energy and polarization of the photon .",
    "we make use of this simplifying fact below .",
    "note that arbitrarily defined partial orderings among the points in general can yield causal sets that can not be realized as a subset of any lorentzian manifold . the _ sprinkling _ procedure @xcite for generating cs  order relations was invented to avoid these microscopic inconsistencies , to avoid other problems that might foul up the macroscopic continuum limit mentioned above , and to ensure a kind of statistical lorentz invariance .",
    "the process begins by randomly sprinkling points in a continuous lorentzian space - time manifold @xmath18 , of the appropriate dimension .",
    "for example , to model flat space , the points would be uniformly and independently distributed points is a region of volume @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "hence this is often called a poisson process , but the essence is the independent and uniform nature of the random distribution , not the poisson distribution function of counts in cells . ] in @xmath18 .",
    "the fundamental density @xmath21 of this distribution is frequently taken to be such that the mean ( continuum ) separation of points is the planck scale .",
    "then the partial order relations among the sprinkled points are derived from the causal ( light - cone ) relations assessed in the continuum @xmath18 .",
    "here we adopt this sprinkling concept as defining causal sets , which in the literature are said to be _ embedded _ into the continuum @xmath18 .",
    "given a causal set ( @xmath3 , @xmath16 embedded in some @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spatial dimension and there is one time dimension , we consider photon propagation in @xmath3 .",
    "given spacetime points @xmath24 , one asks for the value of the _ propagator _ @xmath25 , _ i.e. _ the quantum - mechanical amplitude for a photon emitted at @xmath5 to be detected at @xmath6 ; the probability of this transtion is @xmath26 .",
    "the standard sum over paths formalism@xcite states that the amplitude for each path from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is the product of the amplitudes of each step comprising the path , and the amplitude for the process is obtained by summing these amplitudes over * all paths * from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "it is more realistic to take @xmath27 , a subset of @xmath3 , to represent an unresolved astronomical source , and another subset @xmath28  to represent the detector .",
    "then the usual prescription is that the amplitude for the process of interest ",
    "photons emitted from the source arriving at the detector , symbolically @xmath27@xmath29 @xmath28   is the sum of the amplitudes over all paths starting beginning at some point in @xmath27  and ending at some point in @xmath28 .",
    "the probability of the process @xmath27@xmath29",
    "@xmath28   is the square of the complex amplitude of the process .",
    "this prescription is valid if and only if one is not able to determine which point in @xmath28   the photon arrives at , nor from which point in @xmath27   the photon originates .",
    "if the detector were to be divided into _ pixels _ , such that the identity of the pixel at which the photon arrives is knowable , then as usual amplitudes are additive within pixels , but probabilities are additive across pixels .    to compute the propagator @xmath25 we use the feynman path integral approach which asserts that the propagator is the `` integral '' of @xmath30 over the space of all continuous paths @xmath31 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , where @xmath32 is the action associated with @xmath31 .",
    "whereas in the continuous case this integral is not well - defined in a rigorous sense and its meaning , definition and computation are still an area of investigation , in the causal set scenario the integral reduces to a sum , to which it is easier to give a precise meaning .",
    "related work can be found in @xcite , but unlike these references our approach takes the _ all paths _ spirit of @xcite quite literally , allowing _ causal , non - causal , and superluminal paths _ and relying on the phase averages for large action paths as appropriate weights .",
    "all that remains is specification of the action @xmath33 for an elementary step @xmath17 , for arbitrary points @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath3 , for the corresponding amplitude is  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is planck s constant , and @xmath36 is a normalization factor which can be determined by considering the operator for an infinitesimal advance in time ( @xcite ,  6 ) .",
    "to effect a suitable choice of the action just described , take the amplitude of each causal or non - causal jump to be @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are suitably chosen complex numbers . given a path @xmath39 consisting of @xmath40 steps , set @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of non - causal steps in @xmath31 , and @xmath43 the number of causal ones .",
    "the propagator from @xmath44 to @xmath45 is then @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the number of paths of length @xmath40 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 with exactly @xmath42 non - causal steps .",
    "we now adopt a statistical view and , in a slight abuse of notation , treat @xmath48 and @xmath47 as averages over random sprinklings .",
    "one obvious problem with this definition is that for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath47 is infinite . to rectify this problem , we pick a sufficiently large number @xmath51 and allow jumps ( both casual and non - causal ) only up to distance @xmath52 .",
    "that is , @xmath53 is defined to be an _",
    "admissible path _ only if each step satisfies @xmath54 , where @xmath23 is the distance metric .",
    "this distance should be defined in the cs  sense ( _ e.g. _ as in @xcite ) , but in this preliminary study we have ignored this nuance .",
    "if we denote the corresponding propagator by @xmath55 , then @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the expected number of admissible paths of length @xmath40 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 with exactly @xmath42 non - causal steps [ we will call such paths @xmath58-paths ] .",
    "one can think of the sum in equation either as an ordinary series ( whose convergence will be assured if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are sufficiently small ) or as an _ oscillatory _ series , whose convergence is defined differently .",
    "we choose the former interpretation of equation .",
    "to compute @xmath61 for any @xmath62 , we need a suitable expression for @xmath57 .",
    "the amplitudes of causal and non - causal steps will be represented by defining two functions @xmath63 as follows : @xmath64 and @xmath65 see figure  [ fig : ball ] .",
    "observe that @xmath66 if and only if there is an admissible non - causal jump ( i.e. , path of length one ) from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , and @xmath67 if and only if there is an admissible non - causal jump from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the characteristic function of the ball @xmath71 of radius @xmath52 centered at the origin , and @xmath72 are the characteristic functions of the future and past light cones of the origin .",
    "see figure  [ fig : jump ] .",
    "is the backward light cone of @xmath73 , truncated at distance @xmath52 .",
    "the remaining region marked @xmath74 includes the forward light cone and the remaining region with space - like separations from , and therefore causally disconnected from , @xmath73 . ]",
    "to @xmath6 and @xmath5 to @xmath7 are admissible , but not from @xmath5 to @xmath75 . ]",
    "it is possible to derive explicit formulas for @xmath57 using convolution - type integrals of functions @xmath76 . for lack of space",
    ", we do not present these formulas .",
    "it can then be shown that the functions @xmath77 satisfy the following family of integral equations :    @xmath78    for all @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "a lengthy calculation yields the following integral equation for the propagator : @xmath81    to solve equation , we observe that both @xmath61 and @xmath82 are translation invariant .",
    "this means that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , for some functions @xmath85 .",
    "note also that the integrals in equation are convolutions . applying the fourier",
    "transform @xmath86 , solving for @xmath87 , and applying the inverse fourier transform yields : @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the @xmath90-st convolution power of @xmath91 . to compute the geometric convolution sum in equation , we need to recall that the space @xmath92 of lebesgue integrable functions is a banach algebra @xcite with respect to multiplication given by convolution @xmath93 , but that it does not possess a unit element .",
    "however , a unity  usually denoted by @xmath94 ( one can think of it as the dirac delta `` function '' )  can be adjoined to @xmath92 to obtain a new banach algebra @xmath95 with unity ( cf . , @xcite ,  10.1 ) .",
    "then the sum in equation becomes @xmath96 where the inverse is taken in the extended algebra @xmath95 .",
    "now let @xmath27  and @xmath28  be subsets of @xmath97 representing the source and the detector ( see section  [ sec : feynman ] ) .",
    "then the probability a photon traveling from @xmath27  to @xmath28  is @xmath98 we leave the discussion of this integral for various @xmath27  and @xmath28  to our forthcoming longer paper .",
    "a matrix formalism simplifies numerical evaluation of the propagators for small css . for a causal set consisting of @xmath99 points @xmath100 , define the amplitude matrix @xmath101 = [ a(x_{n } , x_{m } ) ] \\   , \\ ] ] generalizing the connection matrix of graph theory by replacing the @xmath102 indicator of connectivity with the full amplitude from eq . for the step between the points .",
    "the product of @xmath103 with itself , @xmath104_{n , m } = \\sum_{j } a_{n , j } a_{j , m } \\ , \\ ] ] gives the amplitude for two - step transitions @xmath105 with a single intermediate stop at @xmath106 .",
    "similarly @xmath107_{n , m}$ ] gives the amplitude of the same transition with @xmath108 intermediate stops , and the series @xmath109 gives the amplitude summed over all paths .",
    "as long as @xmath110 for some norm , this series converges to the computationally useful form @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the indentity matrix .",
    "so the amplitude of the transition @xmath27  @xmath29 @xmath28  is the sum of the elements of @xmath113 in the sub - block with column indices labeling points in @xmath27   and row indices labeling points in @xmath28 , and the final probability for @xmath27   @xmath29 @xmath28  is the absolute square of this sum .    considering this result and the comments about pixels which identify detected photons made above , we see how precisely and simply these matrix operations implement the fundamental sum - over - histories quantum rules : multiply amplitudes of steps on a path ; add amplitudes of all paths between indistinguishable starting and final states ; add probabilities corresponding to distinguishable final states .",
    "the formalism developed here seems to be a promising approach to computing photon dispersion in the context of causal set theory .",
    "a future publication will elaborate the analytical approach in section iv and the numerical approach in section v , including results on the speed of light as a function of energy .",
