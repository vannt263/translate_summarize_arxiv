    "as one of typical objects in the linear spectral theory , the classical ( normalized ) graph laplacian is directly related to two basic properties of graph @xmath5  connectedness and bipartiteness  through the second eigenvalue @xmath6 and the largest eigenvalue @xmath7 , respectively , when all eigenvalues are arranged in an increasing order : @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the size of @xmath5 .",
    "namely , there holds explicitly :    @xmath10 is connected ;    and then for a connected graph @xmath5 ,    @xmath11 @xmath5 is bipartite .    to further quantify the global connectedness , one recourse to",
    "the cheeger constant @xmath12 , which was first introduced in geometry by cheeger @xcite and later extended into the discrete setting to find a balanced graph cut , i.e. , the cheeger cut problem @xcite .",
    "the second eigenvalue is bounded from up and below by the cheeger constant as stated in the cheeger inequality @xcite .",
    "amazingly , such inequality shrinks to an equality once replacing the graph laplacian by the graph 1-laplacian @xcite .",
    "that is , the second eigenvalue of 1-laplacian equals to the cheeger constant , and more importantly the corresponding eigenvector provides an exact cheeger cut .",
    "this equivalence between the cheeger cut problem and the graph 1-laplacian based continuous optimization paves a way in solving the cheeger cut problem @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there is another effective approach , the lovsz extension @xcite , to realize the gapless transformation from the discrete combination optimization to the continuous function optimization providing the discrete objective function can be expressed as a submodular set function .",
    "this is exactly the case for the cheeger cut problem @xcite .    a similar story for the global bipartiteness and the largest eigenvalue @xmath7 happens . in fact",
    ", the bipartiteness can be directly determined by the maxcut problem as follows    @xmath13 is bipartite ,    where the maxcut ratio is defined as @xmath14 and @xmath15 sums the weight of edges that cross @xmath16 and its complement set @xmath17 , while @xmath18 sums the degree of vertices in @xmath19 . however , solving analytically the maxcut problem is combinatorially np - hard @xcite and some approximate solutions or relaxed strategies are then introduced , like the semidefinite programming ( sdp ) @xcite and the advanced scatter search @xcite approaches .",
    "recently , a recursive spectral cut ( rsc ) algorithm , the first algorithm with a numerical solution the cost of which is strictly larger than 1/2 that is not based on sdp , was proposed based on the bipartiteness ratio @xcite @xmath20 to approach @xmath21",
    ". obviously , @xmath22 .",
    "this bipartiteness ratio @xmath23 is also called the dual cheeger constant with a mathematical motivation to study the spectral gap @xmath24 and it finally comes up with the so - called dual cheeger inequality @xcite @xmath25 which was also mentioned in @xcite . compared to the story for the cheeger constant @xmath12 ,",
    "we naturally ask : _ is there an analog of nonlinear spectral graph theory for the dual cheeger constant @xmath2 which would reduce the inequality to an equality ? _ the existing theoretical approaches can not give an answer .",
    "on one hand , the graph 1-laplacian based theory deals with only the connectedness and the cheeger constant . on the other hand , the original lovsz extension fails because the numerator @xmath26 can not be a submodular set function for disjoint sets @xmath16 and @xmath27 . set against such a background , this work will try to give a positive answer .    in order to answer the above question , we introduce the signless graph 1-laplacian and establish its spectral theory , with which the dual cheeger inequality shrinks to be an equality ( see theorem [ th:1-eigen ] ) , i.e. , @xmath4 with @xmath1 being the first eigenvalue of the signless graph 1-laplacian .",
    "we also extend the courant nodal domain theorem into the signless graph 1-laplacian and such extension ( see theorem [ th : nodal - domain ] ) needs a slight modification of the definition of nodal domains ( see definition [ def : nd ] ) .",
    "we further modify the classical lovsz extension to the set - pair analog ( see theorem [ th : lovasz ] ) which fits for the dual cheeger problem and with this modification , we are able to recover theorem [ th:1-eigen ] .",
    "such generalization is necessary and essential since the usual lovsz extension can only deal with ( submodular ) set functions but the dual cheeger problem involves the set - pair functions . moreover , with the help of subdifferential techniques in nonlinear analysis , we prove that the functional of the signless graph 1-laplacian is locally linear on any given direction .",
    "this local linearity directly implies the inverse power ( ip ) method @xcite and thus provides an efficient implementation of the rsc algorithm , which has not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge . in a word ,",
    "the main purpose of this work is twofold .",
    "one is to demonstrate the use of the signless @xmath0-laplacian based spectral theory into the dual cheeger problem and the maxcut problem , while the other is to characterize the structure of the eigenvector set of the signless @xmath0-laplacian from which more precise insights are revealed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "basic properties of the spectral theory of the signless graph @xmath0-laplacian are presented in section  [ sec : signless ] .",
    "section [ sec : structure ] extends the courant nodal domain theorem into the signless graph 1-laplacian .",
    "section [ sec : lovasz ] provides an improved version of the lovsz extension which can be applied to the dual cheeger problem .",
    "section [ sec : local - ip ] analyzes the functional for the signless graph 1-laplacian as well as the ip method in searching the minimizer , which is applied into the maxcut problem in section [ sec : maxcut ] .",
    "in this section , the signless @xmath0-laplacian is first introduced and the corresponding nonlinear spectral theory is then presented in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "all these results hold for graphs with positive weight .",
    "let @xmath28 be an unweighted and undirected graph with vertex set @xmath29 and edge set @xmath30 , and @xmath31 the degree of the vertex @xmath32 .    before going to the definition of the signless @xmath0-laplacian",
    ", we shall recall that for the laplace matrix and for the signless laplace matrix respectively . as for the laplace matrix",
    ", first we assign an orientation on @xmath5 , and then for each edge @xmath33 , among @xmath32 and @xmath34 , there must be one at the head of @xmath35 , which we write @xmath36 and the other at the tail , which we write @xmath37 .",

    "now @xmath77 is only locally lipschitzian , and @xmath78 is only a locally lipschitzian manifold , thanks to @xcite , the critical point theory has been well developed in this setting .",
    "let @xmath79 be the critical set of @xmath80 , and @xmath81 be the set of all eigenvectors of the signless @xmath0-laplacian , then we have    [ pro : clarker ] @xmath82    similar to the @xmath0-laplacian on graphs , the eigenvectors of the signless @xmath0-laplacian corresponding to the same eigenvalue also may be very abundant .",

    ", we will utilize the proposed ip method to implement the @xmath149-rsc algorithm , and the implementation will be tested on the graphs with positive weight in g - set , a standard testbed for algorithms for the maxcut problem .",
    "it should be noted that , alternatively , the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the 2-laplacian ( i.e. , the normalized graph laplacian ) , a continuous relaxation of the 1-laplacian eigenvalue problem , can be also equipped into the rsc algorithm and we denote the resulting algorithm by @xmath331-rsc .",
    "proposition [ pro : ternarynu ] ensures theoretically the existence of ternary eigenvectors from which two disjoint subsets @xmath84 and @xmath85 of the vertex set are readily obtained .",
    "however , which ternary eigenvector should be chosen and how to numerically determine it play a key role in practice .",
    "a 2-thresholds spectral cut algorithm is proposed in @xcite and the resulting pair @xmath332 maximizes the objective function @xmath333 ( denoted by objfun1 ) where @xmath329 is the weight of edges incident on @xmath334 and @xmath335 the weight of edges that cross @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it was also pointed out that another objective function @xmath336 ( denoted by objfun2 ) gives better results @xcite , where @xmath78 is the weight of edges that have one endpoint in @xmath334 and the other in the complement .",
    "we implement both and employ the mosek solver with cvx @xcite , a package for specifying and solving convex programs , to solve the convex optimization problem .",
    "table [ tab : maxcut ] presents the numerical solutions , from which it is easily observed that : ( a ) with the same rsc solver , objfun2 performs better than objfun1 ; ( b ) with the same object function , @xmath149-rsc gives the cut value greater than or equal to that by @xmath331-rsc .",
    "overall , the @xmath149-rsc algorithm equipped with the object function objfun2 provides the best maxcut among those four solvers .",
    "the resulting rsc algorithm has been proved to be the first algorithm for the maxcut problem with a numerical solution the cost of which is strictly larger than 1/2 that is not based on semidefinite programming .",
    "a simple greedy procedure cuts at least half of the total weight of edges .",
    "here the cost of a solution refers to the ratio between the total weight of cut edges and the total weight of all edges . from table [",
    "tab : maxcut ] , we can also easily verify such fact .",
    "furthermore , a rigorous lower bound for the cost is determined in theorem [ th : epsilon - ratio ] .",
    ".numerical solutions found for problem instances with positive weight in g - set . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ th : epsilon - ratio ] if the @xmath149-rsc algorithm receives in input a graph whose optimum is @xmath337 , then it finds a solution that cuts at least a @xmath338 fraction of edges .    by the greedy method ,",
    "every graph s optimum is not less than @xmath339 .",
    "so , for given graph @xmath28 , we can assume that its optimum is @xmath340 for some @xmath341 $ ] .",
    "that is , there exists a partition @xmath332 such that @xmath342 and then @xmath343 .",
    "consider the t - th iteration of the algorithm , and let @xmath344 be the residual graph at that iteration , and let @xmath345 be the number of edges of @xmath346 .",
    "then we observe that the maxcut optimum in @xmath346 is at least @xmath347 because @xmath348 let @xmath349 , @xmath350 be the partition of found by the algorithm of theorem 1 .",
    "let @xmath351 be the residual graph at the following step , and @xmath352 the number of edges of @xmath351 .",
    "if the algorithm stops at the @xmath353-th iteration , we shall take @xmath351 to be the empty graph ; if the algorithm discards @xmath349 , @xmath350 and chooses a greedy cut , we shall take @xmath351 to be empty and @xmath349 , @xmath350 to be the partition given by the greedy algorithm .    we know by theorem [ th:1-eigen ] that the algorithm will cut at least a @xmath347 fraction of the @xmath354 edges incident on @xmath355 .    indeed , we know that at least a @xmath356 fraction of those edges are cut ( for small value of @xmath357 , it is possible that @xmath358 , but the algorithm is always guaranteed to cut at least half of the edges incident on @xmath355 ) .    1 .   if @xmath359 , then @xmath360 2 .   if @xmath361 , then@xmath362 3 .",
    "if @xmath363 , then @xmath364    summing those bounds above , we have that the number of edges cut by the algorithm is at least @xmath365 the proof is finished .    as for the ratio between the total weight of cut edges and the optimum , it was first proved that the approximation ratio of the @xmath149-rsc algorithm is of at least 0.531 @xcite , and later improved it to 0.614 @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that this lower bound can not be improved greater than 0.768 for @xmath366 .",

    "by the properties of subgradient , we have @xmath367 next we will prove that @xmath368 where @xmath369 is a standard orthogonal basis of @xmath370 .",
    "in fact , one may assume without loss of generality that @xmath371 , @xmath372 . by the definition of subgradient",
    ", we only need to find the @xmath373 such that for any @xmath374 , @xmath375 , that is , @xmath376 it follows from eq .   that @xmath377 and then the above inequality eq",

    ", we immediately get @xmath392 , which implies @xmath393",
    ". one may similarly take @xmath394 and @xmath395 into eq .  .",
    "this deduces that @xmath396 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath397 . on the other hand , eq .",
    "clearly holds when @xmath397 .",
    "analogously , if @xmath398 , we have @xmath399 . by these discussions",
    ", one can readily arrive at @xmath400 , where @xmath401 .",
    "if @xmath5 is connected and bipartite , then there exists a partition @xmath402 of @xmath19 such that @xmath403 implies @xmath404 and @xmath405 .",
