    "flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lac objets form the class of blazars , namely jetted active galactic nuclei whose jet is pointing towards us . since the emitting plasma in the jet moves at relativistic speeds , the emission is strongly beamed , making blazars the most powerful persistent objects in the universe , and visible also at large redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "the operative difference between the two flavours of blazars concerns the importance of the broad emission lines with respect to the underlying continuum , once the blazar nature is confirmed ( strong radio emission with respect to the optical , strong x  ray emission , possibly strong @xmath0ray emission ) . if the ( rest frame , when @xmath1 is known ) equivalent width ew of the lines is larger than 5    the source is a fsrq , if the ew@xmath2  the source is a bl lac ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "this classification criterion is easy and practical , especially when no lines is visible , but does not always correspond to a physical distinction . an alternative way , proposed by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , is to measure the luminosity @xmath3 of all broad lines in units of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath4 ) , and call fsrqs the sources whose @xmath5 , and bl lacs the others .",
    "this is due to the change of the regime of accretion supposed to occur at disc luminosities @xmath6 , and to the fact that , on average , @xmath7 , although with a large dispersion ( see e.g.  2.2 in calderone et al .",
    "below this value the disc is thought to become radiatively inefficient , its uv ionizing luminosity is a minor fraction of its bolometric output and it is not enough to photo  ionize the broad line clouds ( e.g. sbarrato , padovani & ghisellini 2014 ) .",
    "the disadvantage of this , more physical , classification scheme is that , besides the redshift , the black hole mass must be known .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars consists of two broad humps , peaking in the ir ",
    "x  ray band and in the mev  tev band , and , for the most powerful blazars , there is often a third peak due to the contribution of the accretion disc .",
    "simultaneous variability in different spectral bands is often ( but not always ) observed , suggesting that most of the flux is produced in a single region of the jet .",
    "this does not exclude that different zones at different scales of the jet can contribute , at least to dilute the variability amplitude of the main component .",
    "after all , we do see , in vlbi radio maps , distinct blobs at different distances from the central black hole .",
    "these regions are mainly responsible for the radio flux observed at frequencies smaller than @xmath8100 ghz , characterized by variability timescales much longer than what observed from the optical to the @xmath0rays .",
    "the flux in the latter bands must be produced in compact regions , presumably much closer to the black hole : at these scales the radio emission is self  absorbed .",
    "the number of blazars considered for the original blazar sequence by fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter f98 ) was 126 .",
    "these objects belonged to the existing ( at the time ) complete ( flux limited ) samples , namely one x  ray and two radio samples ( elvis et al .",
    "1992 ; khr et al .",
    "1981 ; padovani & urry 1992 ; wall & peacock 1985 ) .",
    "only 33 were detected in the @xmath0ray band by the egret instrument onboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory_. given the limited sensitivity of egret , these 33 blazars were the brightest @xmath0ray blazars at that time .",
    "the 126 objects were divided into 5 ghz radio luminosity bins , their luminosities at selected frequencies were averaged , in order to build the average sed of blazars in each bin of radio luminosity . for the lowest radio luminosity bin , only 3 blazars were detected by egret : mnk 421 , pks 2005489 and pks 2155304 .",
    "donato et al . (",
    "2001 ) later considered the slope of the x  ray emission for the same objects , that was added to the average seds . the result is shown by fig .",
    "the main result of this study was that the shape of the sed changed in a coherent way as the radio luminosity changes .",
    "since the latter is a good tracer of the bolometric luminosity @xmath9 , we can equivalently say that the sequence in fig .",
    "[ seq1 ] shows trends controlled by one parameter , i.e. the total _ observed _ luminosity :    1 .",
    "blazars become  redder \" with increasing @xmath9 , namely the peak frequencies become smaller ; 2 .   at the same time , the ",
    "compton dominance \" increases , namely the ratio of the luminosity of the high energy hump ( that is interpreted as due to the inverse compton process , hence the name ) over the low energy hump ( due to synchrotron ) increases ; 3 .   the @xmath0ray slope become softer with increasing @xmath9 ; 4 .   the x  ray slope becomes harder with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) soon interpreted these properties as due to the different amount of radiative cooling suffered by the emitting electrons in different sources , implicitly assuming that the heating mechanism , instead , was similar for all .",
    "for this explanation , it is crucial to notice that the broad line clouds in fsrqs ( that are more luminous than bl lacs ) can re ",
    "isotropize @xmath810% of the disc radiation .",
    "an even larger fraction can be re ",
    "isotropized and re  emitted in the infrared band by the absorbing torus surrounding the disc .",
    "these radiation components are seen relativistically boosted in the frame comoving with the emitting region of the jet , but they are present only in fsrqs , not in bl lacs . therefore in fsrqs the inverse compton luminosity is large , due to the presence of external seed photons , and this explains a larger compton dominance ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , since the cooling rate is more severe , electrons attain smaller typical energies , explaining why fsrqs have  redder \" sed .    in bl lacs , instead , the lines and the torus ( see chiaberge et al .",
    "1999 ) are absent .",
    "the seed photons for the ic process are due to the internally produced synchrotron radiation , and this implies larger typical electron energies ( they suffer less radiative cooling ) and a smaller compton dominance . the other pillar for explaining the sequence is that lineless bl lacs are less luminous than fsrqs . at the low luminosity extreme ,",
    "the bluest bl lacs should not be strong mev or gev emitters and can even be missed by _ fermi_/lat ( see e.g. bonnoli et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "-0.6 cm -0.1 cm     the fact that the _ observed _ bolometric luminosity is the parameter governing the original blazar sequence is , at first sight , strange .",
    "in fact the observed luminosity is the received flux , assumed isotropic , multiplied by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the luminosity distance . but the emission is instead strongly boosted , so the observed flux depends on the viewing angle @xmath12 and the bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 , that form the beaming factor @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "can the sequence be a sequence of @xmath15 , of objects that instead share the same intrinsic ( i.e. in the comoving frame ) properties ( as proposed by nieppola et al .",
    "in the study of nieppola et al .",
    "( 2008 ) the @xmath15factor is derived through variability of the radio flux , yielding a lower limit on the brightness temperature , and a corresponding lower limit to @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "direct vlbi and vlba measurements of superluminal knots in blazars ( jorstad et al .",
    "2001 ; lister et al .",
    "2013 ) , and modelling ( ghisellini & tavecchio 2015 ) do not find strong differences in the bulk lorentz factors of bl lacs and fsrqs .    in recent years a correlation between the jet power and the accretion luminosity has been found , with some evidence that the jet power is larger than the disc luminosity ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "thus we can wonder if the blazar sequence is mainly due to a sequence of accretion rates .",
    "we believe that this is certainly the case , but at two conditions : i ) the viewing angle @xmath12 is small for all objects ( of the order of @xmath16 , to ensure maximal doppler boost ) , and ii ) the black hole mass of all blazars are similar ( and large ) , so that the accretion rate , in absolute terms , corresponds to the accretion rate in eddington units .",
    "in fact , as mentioned above , the accretion regime changes when the disc luminosity is of the order of @xmath17 ( and this should be the cause of the  blazars divide \" , ghisellini , maraschi & tavecchio 2009 ) .",
    "if this is a sharp threshold or instead there is a smooth transition is a matter of debate ( eg .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "1997 , sharma et al .",
    "2007 ) , but the existence of a transition between a radiatively efficient and a radiatively inefficient regime is rather certain .",
    "this would explain the absence of strong broad emission lines in bl lacs , and their different sed .",
    "is the hypothesis of  same black hole mass for all blazars \" reasonable ?",
    "we believe that for the original sequence there is a strong selection effect making this hypothesis true : given the sensitivity limits of the instruments of @xmath820 years ago ( especially in the @xmath0ray band ) , only the most powerful objects could be observed , and therefore the ones with the largest black hole masses . for bl lacs we have the following chain of arguments : even if bl lacs are not very powerful , the emission of their jet is observed @xmath18 the jet power is larger than some limit @xmath18 the accretion rate is larger than some limit @xmath18 the black hole mass must be large in order to have a radiatively inefficient disc ( i.e. the luminosity is much smaller than the eddington one , yet observable ) . for powerful fsrqs we have : the jet emission is very powerful @xmath18 the jet power is large @xmath18 the accretion rate is large _ and _ the black hole mass is large ( i.e. having luminosities close to eddington but small black hole masses correspond to jets not luminous enough to be observed ) .",
    "one of the motivation of the present work is to check what we can infer now that we have more sensitive instruments : _",
    "fermi_/lat is @xmath820 times more sensitive than egret , and patrols the entire sky in a much more efficient way .",
    "the expectation is that we will start to see blazars with black hole masses smaller than the ones forming the original blazar sequence . in this case",
    "we ought to see a fsrq with a smaller bolometric observed luminosity ( similar to a bl lac belonging to the original sequence ) , but with  red \" sed very typical of fsrqs .",
    "this is because we expect that the parameter controlling the sequence is not the mere luminosity , but the luminosity in units of eddington , as proposed by ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2008 ) .    using the same arguments we expect that an improved sensitivity allows to detect also slightly misaligned objects ,",
    "namely  blazars at the edge \" with @xmath19 .",
    "since the emission of these objects is less beamed and less blueshifted , we should observe fsrqs with a small observed bolometric luminosity that are ( slightly )  redder \" that their powerful aligned cousins and much redder than bl lacs with the same bolometric luminosity .    despite the success to correctly describe the _",
    "observed _ blazars and to explain them in a simple theoretical scheme , the existence of the blazar sequence was and still is a very debated issue .",
    "the main objection is that it could be the result of selection effects that are operating not only when it was proposed , but even now , despite the presence of more sensitive instruments and more extended complete sample down to deeper sensitivity limits ( giommi , menna & padovani , 1999 ; perlman et al .",

    ", it has been recently suggested an alternative scheme , the  simplified blazar scenario \" ( giommi et al .",
    "there are two crucial assumptions in this scheme : i ) a pre  assigned , given distribution of electron energies responsible for the spectral peaks of the sed ( or random lorentz factor @xmath20 ) , ii ) @xmath20 does not correlate with the observed jet luminosity @xmath21 .",
    "this contrasts with the blazar sequence view , in which @xmath20 inversely correlates with @xmath21 . in the  simplified blazar scenario",
    "\" we can have blue and red blazars at all luminosities .",
    "then , through simple prescriptions ( e.g. all blazars have the same magnetic field and doppler factor ) , but taking into account current sensitivity limits in different frequency bands , giommi et al . ( 2012 ) can reproduce the existing observations .",
    "this scheme therefore , does not question the reality of the _ observed _ sequence , but interprets it as the outcome of selection effects .",
    "this is done at the cost of introducing a given @xmath20 distribution , which has no physical explanation yet , and abandoning the idea of the different radiative cooling operating in different blazars ( see also  [ simplified ] ) .",
    "bearing in mind all the above , we feel motivated to revisit the blazar sequence scenario . in the first 4 years of operations ,",
    "_ fermi _ detected about 1500 blazars and for nearly one half of them we know the redshift ( ackermann et al . 2015 ) . besides the impressive amount of @xmath0ray data , we can now take advantage of the sdss survey and the _ planck _ , _ wise _ and _ swift _ satellites . since the @xmath0ray luminosity is often the dominant part of the electromagnetic output , and given the abundance of @xmath0ray sources , we use , as the only criterion for selection , the detection by _ fermi _ and the knowledge of the redshift .",

    "there are some indications , in fact , that _ fermi _ misses to detect the most powerful blazars , that are instead detected by _",

    "but another , additional , reason is that also the rest frame peak frequency could be indeed smaller when increasing the total luminosity .",
    "the most notable trends for fsrqs are the sequence in compton dominance smoothly increasing with luminosity ( from 0.5 to 15 ) , and the slope in x  rays ( described for fsrqs by @xmath48 ) , becoming harder with luminosity ( from @xmath58 to 0.1 ) .",
    "this is easily explained : since the @xmath0ray luminosity increases more than the synchrotron one , the slope between the end of the synchrotron and the  compton \" peak must necessarily become harder .",
    "the above properties can find an easy explanation in terms of a nearly constant radiative cooling rate , as discussed in the next section .",
    "0.2 cm _ bl lac sequence  _ for bl lacs there is a remarkable trend for the entire sed , that changes by changing the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the peak frequencies become smaller as the luminosity increases : @xmath38 goes from @xmath59 hz to @xmath60 hz increasing @xmath28 by 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "similarly , @xmath40 decreases by more than 4 orders of magnitude , with most of the change occurring around @xmath61 erg s@xmath27 .",

    "although @xmath62 changes slightly , when it becomes a little harder than unity it changes @xmath40 by a large amount .",
    "the compton dominance changes by one order of magnitude in the entire luminosity range ( from @xmath80.3 to @xmath83 ) , indicating that in bl lacs the synchrotron and the high energy components are almost equal .",

    "[ vp ] . due to the large shift of @xmath38 ,",
    "this index is the x  ray spectral index at high luminosities , becoming the @xmath0ray spectral index at low luminosities .",

    "0.2 cm _ blazar sequence ",
    "_ when we put together all blazars , the sequence becomes more evident , and more similar to the original one .",
    "this is because , at high luminosities , the properties of the average sed are dominated by fsrqs , while bl lacs dominate the average sed at low @xmath28 . to illustrate this point , fig .",
    "[ newold ] compares the  new \" and the  old \" sequences .",
    "bear in mind that the original sequence was constructed considering bins of radio luminosities , while the new one divides blazars according to the @xmath0ray luminosity .",
    "the main difference concerns the compton dominance at low luminosities , now smaller , and the @xmath0ray slope , that now is barely harder than unity at low luminosities .",
    "another difference concerns the synchrotron peak , changing smoothly in the old sequence , and more abruptly in the new one , around @xmath63 erg s@xmath27 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vpall ] .",
    "0.2 cm _ different black hole masses confuse the sequence  _ as discussed in  2 , the original sequence very likely concerned blazars with large black hole masses ( of both the bl lac and fsrq families ) . now , that we have an improved sensitivity at all frequencies , we start to detect blazars with black holes of smaller masses .",
    "this is particularly so at low luminosities , where we now find intermediate power fsrqs ( at @xmath64 ) , detected at fluxes that could not be reached before , and relatively nearby bl lacs ( with @xmath65 ) of intermediate power as well , but that can have large black hole masses . in the @xmath0ray band , they can have the same luminosity , and therefore they are grouped in the same luminosity bin .",
    "we suggest that this is the main reason of the different sed of fsrqs and bl lacs below @xmath63@xmath66 erg s@xmath27 .",
    "this is illustrated by the examples shown in fig .",
    "[ lowmass ] .",
    "let us discuss the top panel first , comparing the seds of a few fsrqs of similar spectral shape and equal @xmath28 ( pks 1352104 , @xmath1= 0.33 ; pks 1346112 , @xmath1= 0.34 ; s4 0110 + 49 , @xmath1= 0.389 ; 5bzq 1153 + 4931 , @xmath1= 0.334 ) with the sed of a bl lac in the same @xmath28 bin ( 1es 0502 + 675 , @xmath1= 0.34 , black points ) .",
    "[ lowmass ] shows also two models ( solid red line for the fsrqs and blue line for the bl lac ) that can interpret the sub  mm to gev emission , including the thermal part .",
    "this model is described in ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2009 ) .",
    "the upturn in the optical of the fsrqs ( red line ) can be interpreted as due to the contribution of the accretion disc .",
    "together with the broad line luminosity , we can estimate the black hole mass ( @xmath67 ) and the accretion rate ( 0.1 @xmath68 ) .",
    "for the bl lac we do not have any thermal emission to derive the black hole mass and disc luminosity , but the shown fit reports the case of a black hole mass of @xmath69 with a disc emitting at @xmath70 of the eddington limit .",
    "the disc of the bl lac is radiatively inefficient ( see e.g. narayan , garcia & mcclintock , 1997 ) and can not photo  ionize the blr to sustain broad lines of luminosities comparable to the ones of a standard quasar .",
    "the lack of external photons to be scattered at high frequencies implies less @xmath0ray emission ( i.e. less compton dominance ) , less radiative cooling and a larger average electron energy , resulting in a bluer spectrum ( large @xmath38 and @xmath40 ) . as a result ,",
    "the overall sed of the two blazars is completely different , including the @xmath62 slope , and yet the average @xmath28 is the same .",

    "the two sources have comparable radio fluxes .",

    "these cases suggest that when different black hole masses are present , the blazar sequence is  polluted \" by objects of small black hole mass , relatively small luminosity and a  red \" look , that fall in the same luminosity bin of  blue \" bl lacs . on one hand , this implies that the blazar sequence is not controlled by the observed luminosity only , but rather by the eddington ratio . on the other hand , by dividing the objects on the basis of their luminosity , as done here ( and also in the original f98 sequence ) and considering all blazar together , this implies a large dispersion of points around the median spectrum , especially so for the medium and low luminosity bins , as reported in table [ para ] and as can be seen in fig .",

[ bbb ] , there is a sizeable fraction of fsrqs showing a clear presence of thermal disc emission in the optical .",
    "this is flagged by an upturn of the total spectrum , since the synchrotron peak frequency is , on average , in the mm band ( see table [ para ] : @xmath80 hz for fsrqs of all luminosities ) .",
    "the fraction of disc whose emission is clearly visible increases with @xmath28 .",
    "this can be due to fact that the disc component becomes more visible at large redshifts ( hence at large luminosities ) , since in this case the peak of the disc emission ( in the uv , rest frame ) falls into the observed optical band .",
    "another interesting point concerns the relation between the disc and the jet luminosity .",
    "this point has been discussed in ghisellini ( 2016 ) : here we briefly mention that when we normalize the entire sed to the peak of the disc emission , we obtain a reduced scatter in the other bands , especially in the radio and in the x  rays ( in the @xmath0rays the variability amplitude is so large to hide the reduction of the scatter ) .",
    "this can be taken as a model independent evidence that the disc and the jet luminosity are related .",
    "the following are the main findings of our study :    * the blazars detected by _ fermi_/lat of known redshift do form a sequence , with the same general properties of the original blazar sequence found by f98 . * the differences between the new and the old sequence",
    "are explained by the fact that the objects detected by _",
    "fermi _ do not represent  the tip of the iceberg \" in terms of their @xmath0ray luminosity , as was the case for egret and for the original blazar sequence .",
    "* when considering bl lacs and fsrqs separately , we discover that fsrqs do form a sequence , but only in compton dominance and in the x  ray slope .",
    "they do not become redder when more luminous , while bl lacs do .",

    "fermi_. most notably , extreme bl lacs , with their high energy emission peaking in the tev band ( e.g. bonnoli et al .",
    "2015 ) , and very powerful fsrqs , whose high energy peak lies in the mev band ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the fact that fsrqs follow a clear trend in compton dominance , while the peak frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath40 are almost constant calls for an explanation .",
    "we suggest that an important ingredient to interpret this behavior is given by the radiative cooling rate of fsrqs .",
    "a key assumption is that most of the cooling occurs within the blr and/or the molecular torus , and that the inverse compton ( ic ) scatterings off this external radiation is dominant , or at least competitive with respect to the synchrotron cooling .",
    "the ic cooling rate is proportional to the radiation energy density @xmath81 as measured in the comoving frame of the emitting jet region , moving with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 .",
    "this is of the order : @xmath82\\ ] ] where the unprimed quantities are measured in the black hole frame . @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the radiative energy densities due to the blr and the torus , respectively .    if the radius of the broad line region @xmath85 scales as @xmath86 cm , we have ( see e.g. ghisellini & tavecchio 2009 ) : @xmath87 where we have assumed a covering factor @xmath88 for the broad line clouds .",
    "a similar argument can be done for the relevant distance of the molecular torus .",
    "we can assume that the absorbing dust survives at a temperature @xmath89 k. we can also assume that the torus re - emits all the disc radiation it intercepts .",
    "this is a fraction @xmath90 of @xmath91 , that depends on the geometry of the torus itself . for simplicity , and very crudely , let us assume that its shape is similar to a portion of a sphere of radius @xmath92 that is also the distance from the black hole .",
    "assuming that @xmath93 is the total surface of the torus , we have : @xmath94 since @xmath95 , also the energy density @xmath84 produced by the torus is constant , as long as we are at a distance smaller than @xmath92 from the black hole : @xmath96 we can conclude that in the comoving frame , @xmath97 , therefore it is nearly constant if the @xmath13factor is approximately the same in different sources . in this case",
    "the cooling rate is the same in fsrqs of different power .    for bl lacs , instead , the main radiation mechanism for the high energy hump is the synchrotron self  compton process .",
    "it strongly depends upon the synchrotron radiation energy density in the comoving frame that is an increasing function of the observed luminosity .",
    "therefore the cooling is not constant , but it is more severe in more powerful bl lacs . as a consequence , the energy of the electrons emitting at the sed peak could be smaller ( due to the larger cooling ) in high luminosity bl lacs , and both @xmath38 and @xmath40 would be smaller . in fsrqs , instead , the same cooling rate implies the same relevant electron energies and constant peak frequencies .    for fsrqs",
    "we have to explain also why the compton dominance increases with total power . since @xmath81 is roughly constant ( for constant @xmath13 )",
    ", the only possibility is that the magnetic energy density @xmath98 _ decreases _ with luminosity .",
    "the ratio @xmath99 , in fact , determines the value of the compton dominance . since @xmath100",
