    "the approximately extremal polynomial @xmath63 for the definition of the discrepancy density @xmath1 should have its zeros as hyperbolically equidistributed as possible , with a prescribed density . since it stands to reason that we may model these approximately minimizing polynomials by a single holomorphic function @xmath63 in the disk @xmath24 , we could try to look for @xmath63 which is a diffential of order @xmath35 ( or a character - diffential of the same order @xmath35 ) , periodic with respect to a fuchsian group @xmath114 such that @xmath115 is a compact riemann surface .",
    "the most natural choice would be to also ask that the zeros of @xmath63 are located along a hyperbolic equilateral triangular lattice .",
    "for instance , we may compare with the analogous planar case the bound achieved by the unilateral triangular lattice is @xmath14 .",
    "however , the structure of hyperbolic lattices is more rigid than the corresponding planar one , and the relevant quantities are harder to evaluate .",
    "mcmullen s notion of asymptotic variance is very much related to makarov s modelling of bloch functions as martingales @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "compare also with lyons approach @xcite to understand bloch functions as maps from hyperbolic brownian motion to a planar brownian motion ( but for it , the speed of the local variance is variable but at least bounded ) @xcite .",

    "we now comment on ivrii s proof of his theorem .",
    "it is an important for the proof that for small @xmath12 , the function @xmath132 can be modelled by @xmath133 for some @xmath60 with @xmath134 , where @xmath135 denotes the beurling transform @xmath136 moreover , after an inversion of the plane , @xmath133 essentially becomes @xmath137 .",
    "while this is standard technology in quasiconformal theory , the first important observation ivrii makes is the `` box lemma '' , which says that for @xmath59 with @xmath138 , the control of the right - hand side integral in @xmath139 can be localized to a hyperbolic disk of large fixed radius instead .",
    "this is a kind of weak control of square function type ( compare with e.g. bauelos @xcite ) , which tells us we are in the right ballpark .",
    "a clever combination with the lipschitz property of bloch functions @xcite then gives the control from above and below , more or less simultaneously .",
    "ivrii actually obtains slightly better control than stated above . in any case",
    ", he also derives the following dimension expansion via the legendre transform formalism connecting the dimension and integral means spectra ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , p. 241 ) .",
