    "the statistics indicate that as the degree of degeneracy of the eigenvalues of @xmath35 and @xmath14 is reduced ( i.e. , the number of saddle submanifolds increases ) , the underlying quantum control landscapes become more structurally complex . however , the distinctions between the encountered structural features are modest over all of the cases examined . in an absolute sense ,",
    "all of the trajectories produced @xmath145 indicating only very mild landscape structural features .",
    "prior experience with state - to - state transition probability landscapes suggests that ` straight shot ' trajectories are reserved for cases with @xmath146 , and a search is generally needed to find a proper @xmath21 to initiate such a trajectory  @xcite .",

    "then , separately , we used the 250 trajectories with the highest values of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , trajectories with @xmath150 were used to generate the histograms in figure  [ disthistpo](a ) , and likewise with @xmath151 for the histograms in figure  [ disthistpo](b ) ; in both cases the histograms show all possible pairs of distances , with @xmath152 pairs .",
    "the distribution of distances between initial fields , in blue , is centered to the left and narrower than the distribution corresponding to the distances between optimal fields , in red .",
    "this behavior implies that the optimal fields are scattered more widely throughout control space than the randomly picked initial fields .",
    "the histogram in green of the distances between all initial - final field pairs is centered between the other two distributions .",
    "the most significant feature in figure  [ disthistpo ] is that the distributions are very similar , whether generated from trajectories with low values of @xmath2 ( figure  [ disthistpo](a ) ) or from trajectories with high values of @xmath2 ( figure  [ disthistpo](b ) ) .",
    "this result suggests that trajectories with low and high values of @xmath2 are distributed in the same way across control space .",

    "together with previous work which observed that typical @xmath2 values for generating unitary transformations scales linearly with the number of states @xmath27  @xcite , these findings suggest that the unitary transformation landscape appears to be structurally similar to the ensemble control landscape with fully nondegenerate @xmath142 and @xmath14 matrices .",

    "a condition for the existence of control trajectories with @xmath195 , which would indicate exceedingly simple landscape structure , was also derived .",
    "it was found that in order for the gradient algorithm to yield a straight trajectory , the gradient function must not only be separable in @xmath38 and @xmath196 , but must also be an eigenfunction of the hessian .",
    "this situation also implies that all higher - order derivatives of the cost functional possess a common eigenfunction .",
    "the eigen - relation may form a basis to identify the conditions under which exactly straight control trajectories derived from the gradient algorithm exist .",
    "additional simulations exploring landscape structure on a wider variety of landscapes would also allow for a better understanding of the conditions that lead to low values of @xmath2 .",
    "one direction for further investigation is whether achieving control of unitary transformations , which requires control over every matrix element in the propagator , leads to higher values of @xmath2 than even for the fully nondegenerate ensemble control landscapes .",
    "a simple assessment of this matter was performed for a two level system using an es algorithm  @xcite to search for straight trajectories . for two - level systems , in the cases of maximizing @xmath197 we find @xmath198 , while for unitary transformation control @xmath199 was achieved .",
    "+ quantum control landscapes are expected to nominally be very complex , as they are defined on extremely high dimensional spaces and represent the generally nonlinear relationship , encoded through schrdinger s equation , between the unitary propagator and a dynamical set of controls .",
    "thus , a natural expectation is that trajectories traveling over these landscapes would require considerable effort to reach an optimal outcome .",
    "however , the topology of quantum control landscapes is very simple when certain reasonable physical assumptions are met , providing one factor to explain the relative ease of performing optimizations  @xcite .",
    "these topological results are complemented by the finding in this work of simple landscape structure .",

    "collectively , the twofold simplicity of landscape features , encapsulated by topology and structure , provides a foundation for more clearly explaining the widespread efficiency of finding optimal controls over quantum phenomena .",
    "this appendix gives a brief overview of the critical submanifolds of the quantum ensemble control landscape , along with a metric which can be used to determine the distance to all critical submanifolds from any given point in control space .",

    "this condition implies that the number of critical submanifolds is in one - to - one correspondence with the number of ways the eigenvalues of @xmath201 can be permuted such that their overlaps with the eigenvalues of @xmath14 are distinct .",
    "these permutations are induced by critical propagators @xmath28 , each of which belongs to a distinct critical submanifold , and can be enumerated using contingency tables  @xcite .",
    "these tables possess @xmath202 rows and @xmath203 columns and can be constructed as follows .",
    "first , @xmath142 and @xmath14 are expressed in diagonal form with their eigenvalues in descending order .",
    "then , a particular permutation is applied to the eigenvalues of @xmath142 ; such a permutation matrix @xmath63 is associated with the said critical submanifold .",
    "the number of times the eigenvalue @xmath204 of @xmath142 overlaps with the eigenvalue @xmath205 of @xmath14 , after the permutation is applied , is the value @xmath206 of the @xmath207 entry in the contingency table .",
    "the rows of the contingency table must add up to the sum of the degeneracies of the eigenvalues of @xmath14 , and the columns of the table must add up to the sum of the degeneracies of the eigenvalues of @xmath142 .",
    "this fact can be used to easily construct all possible contingency tables and therefore reveal every critical submanifold along with its associated height on the landscape .",
    "+ the contingency tables can also be used to calculate a distance to a particular critical submanifold from any point on the landscape .",

    "it can be shown that the singular value decomposition of each block contains only 0s and 1s , and that for the @xmath215th block of size @xmath216 the number of 1s is equal to @xmath206 , which is the entry in the @xmath212th row and @xmath214th column in the contingency table .",

    "to do so , the unitary matrix @xmath219 can be assigned a vector consisting of the singular values of all of its blocks @xmath220 .",
    "since the squares of these singular values sum to @xmath27 , each vector can be thought of as lying in the spherical polygon spanned by the vectors corresponding to the @xmath63 matrices of the critical submanifolds .",
