    "lattice qcd calculations , at vanishing or finite net - baryon density , predict a cross - over transition from the deconfined thermalized partonic matter ( the quark gluon plasma , qgp ) to hadronic matter at a critical temperature @xmath1180  mev  @xcite .    measurements of hadron yields in the intermediate and high transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) region indicate that dense matter is produced in  collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed large amount of elliptic flow of multi - strange hadrons  @xcite , such as the @xmath3 meson and the @xmath4 baryon , suggest that collective motion develops in the early partonic stage of the matter produced in these collisions .",
    "a crucial issue to be addressed next is the thermalization status of this partonic matter .",
    "heavy - flavor ( c , b ) quarks are particularly excellent tools  @xcite to study the thermalization of the initially created matter . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , their large masses are almost exclusively generated through their coupling to the higgs field in the electro - weak sector , while masses of light quarks ( u , d , s ) are dominated by spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd .",
    "this means that in a qgp , where chiral symmetry might be restored , light quarks are left with their bare current masses while heavy - flavor quarks remain heavy .",
    "due to their large masses ( @xmath5 ) , the heavy quarks can only be pair - created in early stage pqcd processes .",
    "furthermore , their production cross sections in nuclear collisions are found to scale with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite . in the subsequent evolution of the medium ,",
    "the number of heavy quarks is conserved because the typical temperature of the medium is much smaller than the heavy quark ( c , b ) masses , resulting in negligible secondary pair production .",
    "in addition , the heavy quarks live much longer than the lifetime of the formed high - density medium , decaying well outside .",
    "these heavy quarks ( c , b ) can participate in collective motion or even kinetically equilibrate if , and only if , interactions at the partonic level occur at high frequency .",
    "the idea of statistical hadronization of kinetically equilibrated charm quarks  @xcite even predicted significant changes in hidden charm hadron production  @xcite .",
    "hence , heavy - flavor quarks are an ideal probe to study early dynamics in high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "recent star and phenix results on elliptic flow and nuclear modification factors of non - photonic electrons indicate that charm quarks might indeed participate in the collective motion of the matter produced in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "to explain the data , a large drag diffusion coefficient in the langevin equation , describing the propagation of charm quarks in the medium , is found to be necessary @xcite .",
    "two- and three - body interactions  @xcite of heavy - quarks and resonant rescattering  @xcite in the partonic stage seem to become important .",
    "these investigations suggest that heavy - quarks actively participate in the partonic stage .    in this paper , we study the change of azimuthal correlations of d and @xmath6 meson pairs as a sensitive indicator of frequent occurrences of partonic scattering . since",
    "heavy - flavor quarks are pair - created by initial scattering processes , such as @xmath7 , each quark - antiquark pair is correlated in relative azimuth @xmath8 due to momentum conservation . in elementary collisions , these correlations survive the fragmentation process to a large extent and hence are observable in the distribution of the relative azimuth of pairs of d and @xmath6 mesons  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate by how much these correlations should be affected by the early qgp stage and by the hadronic scattering processes in the late hadronic stage .",
    "to explore how the qcd medium generated in central ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions influences the correlations of d and @xmath6 meson pairs , we employ a non - relativistic langevin approach which describes the random walk of charm quarks in a qgp as was first described in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , both the drag coefficient @xmath9 and the momentum - space diffusion coefficient @xmath10 depend on the _ local _ temperature , @xmath11 with a momentum - independent @xmath12 .",
    "we chose @xmath13 ( fm/@xmath14)@xmath15 mev@xmath16 .",
    "details of our calculations can be found in  @xcite .    in order to isolate the effects purely due to parton - parton re - scattering in the outlined medium",
    ", we generated c and @xmath17 quarks with the same @xmath2 and zero longitudinal momentum back - to - back , i.e.  with @xmath18 at a time of the order of @xmath19  0.1  fm/@xmath14 , and used a delta function for fragmenting the charm quark into a charmed hadron at the hadronization stage .",
    "the radius @xmath20 where each pair is created is randomly generated from a distribution reflecting the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions taking place at that radius , @xmath21 .",
    "the angular distribution of the initially produced charm quarks in the transverse plane is isotropic .",
    "the evolution of the charm momenta with the langevin equation is stopped when @xmath11 reaches the critical temperature @xmath22  mev or when the charm quark leaves the qgp volume .",
    "furthermore , to get a first estimation of the qgp effect on the charm quark pairs azimuthal correlation , we omit the possible contribution of the mixed phase .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the results for the d meson ( charm quark ) pairs angular correlations for different initial charm quark @xmath23 values , for @xmath24  mev and @xmath25  fm/@xmath14 ( typical values for rhic collisions ) .",
    "we see that the fastest charm quarks ( represented by the @xmath26  gev/@xmath14 ) are able to escape from the qgp without suffering significant medium effects , while the slower quarks ( see the @xmath27  gev/@xmath14 black line ) have their pair azimuthal correlation almost completely smeared out by the interactions in the medium .",
    "figure  [ fig3](b ) shows the corresponding results for @xmath28  mev and @xmath29  fm/@xmath14 , values representative of lhc energies . here",
    ", the interactions of the charm quarks with the medium are so frequent that only the most energetic charm quarks preserve part of their initial angular correlation ; low @xmath2 pairs can even be completely stopped by the medium . because the c and the @xmath17 quarks of a given pair are created together , in the same space point",
    ", the pair has a higher escape probability if both quarks escape the medium from the side of the fireball where the thickness is smaller .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 distribution is shifted towards smaller values .",
    "presently , reliable numbers on the drag coefficient do not exist  @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the drag coefficient is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and ( d ) for the c@xmath17 angular correlations for energetic c quarks : @xmath30 and 10  gev/@xmath14 for @xmath24 and 700  mev , respectively .",
    "these correlations vanish when @xmath31 is increased by around a factor of five in the first case and by around a factor of two in the latter one , with respect to values from pqcd - calculations .     of @xmath0",
    "pairs from langevin calculations with @xmath24  mev ( rhic ) and @xmath32  mev ( lhc ) .",
    "the upper part shows the dependence of the correlations on the initial @xmath2 of the c quark ; the lower part shows the drag coefficient dependence.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we have demonstrated that initial correlations of @xmath33 pair correlations are clearly affected by the formed qcd medium , and sensitive to its temperature and drag coefficient .",
    "the question is to what extent hadronic interaction can modify these initial correlations . in the following ,",
    "we apply the microscopic hadronic transport approach urqmd v.  2.2  @xcite .",
    "a phase transition to a qgp state is _ not _ incorporated into the model dynamics . in the latest version of the model , pythia ( v.  6.139 ) was integrated to describe the energetic primary elementary collisions  @xcite .",
    "measured particle yields and spectra are well reproduced by this approach  @xcite .    in this model ,",
    "d mesons stem from the early - stage high - energy nucleon - nucleon collisions , calculated with pythia . for their propagation in the hadronic medium",
    ", we consider elastic scattering of d mesons with all other hadrons .",
    "the hadronic scattering cross - section for d mesons is generally considered to be small  @xcite and we take 2  mb in our calculation .",
    "the results of the urqmd calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , for minimum bias au+au reactions at @xmath34  gev .",
    "to better illustrate the _ change _ in the angular correlations of the @xmath35 pairs , we show the ratio between the final distribution , affected by the evolution with urqmd , and the initial one , directly obtained from pythia . in case",
    "hadronic interactions do not modify the correlations , this ratio is unity .    for this specific analysis ,",
    "all @xmath0 pairs were selected , irrespective of the @xmath2 of the d mesons . fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) shows our results assuming a forward peaked scattering cross section , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the scattering angle in the center of mass system of the decaying resonance . even for a large cross section of 20  mb , the @xmath35 pair correlations",
    "are barely affected by hadronic interactions .    on the other hand ,",
    "intermediate resonances formation ( essentially d@xmath38d@xmath39 ) , might result in isotropic emission , i.e. the correlation might be completely destroyed by a single scattering process .",
    "only when assuming the unlikely case of a large cross section of 20  mb with fully isotropic emission , the @xmath0 pair correlations are significantly modified , see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "we also find that most scatterings occur at relatively early times , when the hadron density is high . at rhic energies ,",
    "the ( pure ) hadronic stage is presumably shorter than assumed in the present calculations .",
    "hence , we conclude that hadronic interactions are unlikely to significantly modify @xmath0 pair correlations . a change in these angular correlation",
    "must be dominated by frequent parton - parton scatterings occurring in the qgp phase .",
    "distributions of @xmath0 pairs produced in minimum bias au+au reactions at @xmath34  gev , before and after hadronic rescattering , using forward ( left panel ) and isotropic ( right panel ) angular distributions.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the calculations reported above show that heavy - flavor correlations provide a sensitive tool to directly access the status of equilibration of the partonic medium .",
    "a similar picture emerges from the observation and suppression of back - to - back correlations of unidentified high @xmath2 hadrons ( jets ) .",
    "both features originate from the propagation of partons ( heavy quarks or jets ) in the medium .",
    "however , d mesons ( and b mesons ) have the advantage that they can still be identified , even if they lose a significant fraction of their energy and get kinetically equilibrated .",
    "in summary , we argue that the observation of broadened angular correlations of heavy - flavor hadron pairs in high - energy heavy - ion collisions would be an indication of thermalization at the partonic stage ( among light quarks and gluons ) . we have seen that hadronic interactions at a late stage in the collision evolution can not significantly disturb the azimuthal correlations of @xmath0pairs .",
    "thus , a visible decrease or the complete absence of such correlations , would indicate frequent interactions of heavy - flavor quarks and other light partons in the partonic stage , implying early thermalization of light quarks in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "these measurements require good statistics of events in which _ both _ d mesons are cleanly reconstructed . a complete reconstruction of the d mesons ( i.e.  of _ all _ their decay products ) in full azimuth is essential to preserve the kinematic information and to optimize the acceptance for detecting correlated d meson pairs .",
    "solid experimental measurements in @xmath40 and light - ion collisions , at the same energy , are crucial for detailed studies of changes in these azimuthal correlations , and should be performed as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "proposed upgrades of star  @xcite and phenix at rhic and the alice detector  @xcite at lhc with micro - vertex capabilities and direct open charm reconstruction should make these measurements possible .    * acknowledgements * k.s .",
