    "the existence of nontrivial topological configurations in the qcd vacuum is a fundamental property of the nonabelian gauge theory .",
    "transitions between topologically different states occur with a change of the topological quantum number @xmath3 characterizing these states and induce anomalous processes like local violation of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the idea that non - central heavy - ion collisions may result in such a violation was first postulated over a decade ago in refs .",
    "the interplay of topological configurations with ( chiral ) quarks shows the local imbalance of chirality .",
    "such a chiral asymmetry when coupled to a strong magnetic field - as created by colliding nuclei perpendicular to the reaction plane - induces a current of electric charge along the direction of the magnetic field which leads to a separation of oppositely charged particles with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "thus , as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the topological effects in qcd might be observed in heavy - ion collisions directly in the presence of very intense external electromagnetic fields due to the `` chiral magnetic effect '' ( cme ) as a manifestation of spontaneous violation of the @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "indeed , it was shown that electromagnetic fields of the required strength can be created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental evidence for the cme - identified via the charge separation effect with respect to the reaction plane - was measured by the star collaboration at the rhic in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath1200 and 62 gev  @xcite .    these results from the star collaboration on charge - dependent correlations are consistent with theoretical expectations for the cme .",
    "accordingly , a positive correlation for like - sign charged pion pairs and a negative one for unlike - sign charged pairs was observed but these correlations might have contributions from other effects that prevent a definitive interpretation of the data .",
    "this finding has been a subject of intense discussions for the last few years .",
    "the search for different sources of the background and additional manifestations of local parity violation has been discussed in refs .",
    "several of these contaminating sources have been investigated but none was found to consistently create signals of the right magnitude and centrality dependence .",
    "it turned out be possible to reproduce the observed charge asymmetry at both energies of @xmath162 and 200 gev in terms of a simple phenomenological model in ref .",
    "this model considers a one - dimensional random walk in the topological quantum number space within a background magnetic field calculated dynamically within the ( ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model .",
    "the topological charge @xmath3 generated during the life - time @xmath6 , when the magnetic field is present , can be related to the measured angular correlator by tuning @xmath6 at a single energy at the given centrality .",
    "the model nicely reproduces the star results at both energies and predicts that the cme should disappear below the collision energy close to the top sps energy of @xmath220 gev  @xcite .",
    "recently , preliminary data below the nominal rhic energy within the rhic beam - energy - scan ( bes ) program have been obtained  @xcite . in our work",
    "we analyze these data to clarify to which extent they might be related to the cme .",
    "our consideration is based on the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) approach that has been employed before in our study of the cme at the top rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "the role of the retarded electro - magnetic fields generated during the nuclear collision and , in particular , the impact of electric and magnetic transverse components will be discussed in detail .",
    "we study the space - time evolution of relativistic heavy - ion collisions within the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach  @xcite which goes beyond the on - shell boltzmann kinetic equation and in line with the kadanoff - baym equation treats the nuclear collisions in terms of quasiparticles with a finite width .",
    "the hsd model quite successfully describes many observables in a large range of the collision energies  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this approach was extended to include the dynamical formation of the retarded electromagnetic fields , their evolution during a collision and influence on the quasiparticle dynamics as well as the interplay of the created magnetic and electric fields and back - reaction effects .",
    "it was shown that the influence of electromagnetic effects on observables is negligible at the collision energy @xmath1200 gev  @xcite .",
    "so , we start our calculations within the traditional hsd approach  @xcite without the inclusion of the electromagnetic field and come back to this issue in the next section .",
    "an experimental signal of the local spontaneous parity violation is a charged particle separation with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by the two - body correlator in the azimuthal angles , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane defined by the beam axis and the line joining the centers of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the averaging in eq .",
    "( [ cos ] ) is carried out over the whole event ensemble .",

    "[ c2hpr ] for the available three bes energies .",
    "the case for the top hic energy @xmath1200 gev is also presented for comparison .",
    "the statistics of the calculated events is given in table [ stat : hsd ] .",
    "at the lowest measured energy @xmath17.7 gev the results for oppositely and same - charged pions practically coincide and show a large enhancement in very peripheral collisions .",
    "the centrality distributions of @xmath12 are well reproduced by the hsd calculations .",
    "the striking result is that the case of @xmath17.7 gev drastically differs from @xmath1200 gev ( cf . the right bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ c2hpr ] ) .",
    "the picture quantitatively changes only slightly when one proceeds to @xmath111.5 gev ( see the right top panel in fig .",
    "[ c2hpr ] ) though the value at the maximum ( centrality 70@xmath13 ) decreases by a factor of 3 in the calculations .",
    "experimental points at this large centrality are not available but the experimental trend  @xcite shown by the dashed lines goes roughly to the same value as at 7.7 gev .",
    "in addition , one may indicate a weak charge separation effect in the data because statistical error bars are very small ( less than the symbol size ) .",
    "if one looks now at the results for @xmath139 gev , the measured same- and oppositely charged pion lines are clearly separated , being positive for the same - charged and negative for the oppositely charged pions but strongly suppressed .",
    "the hsd model is not able to describe this picture : it looks like theoretical same- and oppositely charged pions would mutually interchange their positions .",
    "the same situation is observed in the case of @xmath1200 gev ; a small difference is seen in very peripheral collisions : the oppositely charged correlation goes to zero at centrality 70% for @xmath139 gev while corresponding data at 200 gev are not available .    though the results at @xmath17.7 and 11.5 can be considered as a background of the cme , at higher energies it is impossible to identify the true effect of the local parity violation as the difference between measured and hsd results .",
    "the hsd model does not include directly the dynamics of quark - gluon degrees - of - freedom which are getting important with increasing energy .",
    "these effects are incorporated in the novel parton - hadron - string - dynamics ( phsd ) approach  @xcite which has not yet been incorporated in the present study for the cme .",
    "an increasing importance of a repulsive partonic component is illustrated by a rise of the elliptic flow explained convincingly in the phsd model  @xcite .",
    "thus , azimuthal correlations at the energies @xmath17.7 and 11.5 gev are quite reasonably reproduced by the hadronic dynamics within the hsd model leaving no room for further effects of local parity violation .",
    "the situation at higher collision energies is more complicated and uncertain .",
    "evidently other sources of correlations can not be excluded for @xmath1440 gev . in this energy range",
    "quark - gluon degrees - of - freedom became essential as well as fluctuations of the color fields . in this respect",
    "an application of the phsd approach  @xcite will be mandatory on an event - by - event basis incorporating the fluctuations of the partonic mean fields .",
    "we have mentioned above that the hsd model has been extended to take simultaneously into account the creation and evolution of retarded electromagnetic fields treated by the maxwell equations in the vacuum  @xcite and their back - reaction on the particle propagation .    as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , fluctuations in initial proton positions may result in high fluctuations of electromagnetic fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was demonstrated in terms of a rather schematic model at time @xmath15 and at the single point @xmath160 .",
    "the hsd calculations are performed on an event - by - event basis and therefore dynamical fluctuations in the hadronic variables ( including initial nucleon positions ) are included .",
    "however , the retarded electromagnetic fields are calculated by averaging over events in a parallel ensemble .",
    "thus , electromagnetic field fluctuations due to initial proton position fluctuations are averaged out in the present study .",
    "unfortunately , our analysis has shown that the bulk observables and charge separation effect are not sensitive to the electromagnetic field dynamics at @xmath1200 gev  @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ be_mesons ] one may get an idea about the strength of the magnetic and electric field in au+au collisions at @xmath17.7 gev in a peripheral reaction with the impact parameter @xmath10= 10 fm .",
    "the magnetic field is perpendicular to the reaction plane @xmath17 and it s maximal value is about 0.13 @xmath18 which is by about an order of magnitude lower than at @xmath19=200 gev ( cf .",
    "this is still a rather strong magnetic field and it persists by about a factor of 20 times longer than that at @xmath19=200 gev .",
    "the electric field , oriented essentially along the @xmath20-axis , is also sizable and decreases in time somewhat slower than the magnetic field .",
    "naively , one might think that the insensitivity of observables to the electromagnetic field created in relativistic nuclear collisions is due to the short interaction time when the created field has its maximum . however , this is not the case .",
    "let us look at the early time dynamics in more detail and introduce a momentum increment @xmath21 as a sum of the average increase of the particle momentum @xmath22 due to the action of the electric and magnetic forces , @xmath23 on pions during the short time interval at the expense of the given source [ dt ] = _",
    "t_i < dp(t_i ) > . in fig .  [ dp_mesons ]",
    "the average momentum change of positive pions is shown for the three components of the electromagnetic force at two collision energies .",
    "note the different time scale at these energies and that the increment components are noticeably larger for the top rhic energy .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that in both cases the transverse electric and magnetic components are almost completely compensated ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ dp_mesons ] ) . for a quasiparticle at @xmath24 in a simplified one dimensional ( 1d ) case",
    ", this compensation can be illustrated by a short calculation as e e =- e ~-e ~-ebv  , [ comp ] the action of the electric and magnetic transverse components is roughly equal and inversely directed .",
    "this finding illustrates that considerations of heavy - ion collisions with only magnetic fields are not appropriate and misleading .",
    "our study shows that the two - pion azimuthal angular correlations - as measured by the star collaboration - and considered as a possible signal of local parity violation in strong interactions can be reasonably described at moderate energies @xmath257.7 and 11.5 gev within the conventional microscopic transport hsd model . the observed behavior of oppositely and same - sign charged pions is correctly reproduced in shape and roughly in absolute magnitude without involving the parity violation concept .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the prediction that the cme will not be observable at energies below the top cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) energy , @xmath26 20 gev  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the situation is very different at higher energies @xmath139 gev and consistent with the findings at the top rhic energy @xmath1200 gev .",
    "the calculated hadronic background is definitely not sufficient to explain the experimental observations though hadronic competing effects as considered in refs .",
    "@xcite which are involved to a large extent . nevertheless , other sources for pion correlations - stemming from explicit partonic dynamics and color field fluctuations - have to be considered as well in the future .",
    "a simulation of the genuine cme is of great interest , however , a simultaneous analysis of all other hadronic observables will be very important to restrict the models of relevance to this issue .",
    "we have found out that the average of retarded strong electromagnetic fields created during nucleus - nucleus collisions turns out to be not so important as expected before .",
    "the electromagnetic field has almost no influence on hadronic observables and , in particular , on the asymmetry of charged mesons with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "the reason is not a shortness of the interaction time , when the electromagnetic field is maximal , but the demonstrated compensation of the mutual action of transverse electric and magnetic components .",
    "this compensation effect may be important , for example , if an additional induced electric field ( as a source of the cme ) is available in the system since this field will not be entangled due to other electromagnetic sources .    another important point emerging from the compensation effect",
    "is the following : a significance of an external magnetic field in astrophysics is largely accepted .",
    "there are many studies where various effects of external magnetic fields are discussed in application to astrophysics ( _ e.g. _ , see the introduction in ref .",
    "@xcite and references in @xcite ) .",
    "this is correct in the particular problems considered , however , in many cases it is concluded by statements like `` the same effect should be observed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions '' which does not hold true due the compensation effect as demonstrated in the present work .",
