    "many mathematicians have already studied generalized topological spaces in the sense of csszr s article @xcite . although our article does not concern csszr s style generalization of topologies , we thank t. kubiak for turning our attention to the fact that generalizations of topologies such that it is not assumed that finite intersections of open sets are open , appeared in @xcite , earlier than in @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , only several articles about it have been published so far .",
