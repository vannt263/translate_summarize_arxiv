    "x - ray observations probe the central regions of agn . in the standard paradigm , this corresponds to the inner parts of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole . above the disk ,",
    "a hot corona compton upscatters optical - euv photons to x - ray energies ; some of this x - ray radiation is reprocessed in the surrounding material including the disk , giving rise to prominent fe k@xmath2 lines .",
    "the broad , distorted velocity profile of fe k@xmath2 emission , suggesting an accretion disk around a supermasive black hole , was first observed with _ asca _   in mcg 6 - 30 - 16 ( tanaka et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this profile , with a sharp blue wing and a broad red tail , is a remarkable probe of the strong gravity regime .",
    "studies of other agn with _ asca",
    "_  suggested that broad , low - ionisation fe k@xmath2 emission is common in agn ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 , reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) , but it was not until the launch of _ xmm - newton _  that the diversity of fe line profiles could really be investigated . with the large increase in collecting area afforded by _ xmm - newton",
    "_ , it was soon noticed that some luminous agn showed different fe line profiles to that of mcg 6 - 30 - 15 ( e.g. reeves et al .",
    "2001a , blustin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "one particularly interesting example , the luminous seyfert 1 galaxy mrk  205 , appeared to have a narrow , neutral fe k@xmath2 line at 6.4 kev , accompanied by a broad line from he - like fe ( reeves et al .",
    "reeves et al . argued that the ionised fe line originates in the inner parts of an accretion disk , while the neutral fe k@xmath2 line originates in a molecular torus , hypothesised to lie outside the broad line regions in agn unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "a later observation of another seyfert galaxy , mrk  509 , showed a very similar pair of narrow - neutral and broad - ionised fe k@xmath2 emission lines ( pounds et al .",
    "2001 ) , demonstrating that this configuration of fe k@xmath2 profiles is not an isolated phenomenon in mrk  205 .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the fe k features in mrk  205 and mrk  509 seen by _ xmm - newton_. by coadding the spectra from the three epic instruments we are able to maximise the signal to noise per bin while properly sampling the epic spectral resolution around fe k. the paper is laid out as follows . in section [ sec : observation ] we describe the observations and data reduction , and we describe the spectral fitting in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] and we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendix contains a description of the method employed to coadd spectra from the different epic instruments .",
    "mrk  205 was observed with _ xmm - newton _  on the 7th may 2000 , and these data were presented by reeves et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "several exposures were taken in both mos and pn cameras , in full frame and large - window modes .",
    "spectra of the source were extracted from circular regions of radius @xmath3 and background spectra were obtained from nearby source - free regions .",
    "all valid event patterns ( singles , doubles , and triples ) were selected in mos , and only single events in pn .",
    "the spectra were combined using the procedure outlined in appendix a.    mrk  509 has been observed twice with _ xmm - newton_. the first observation took place on 25th november 2000 and the data were presented by pounds et al .",

    "the spectral fitting was performed with xspec .",
    "only the rest - frame 3 - 10 kev energy range was used in the spectral fitting because we are primarily interested in the fe k features .",
    "the broad emission lines reported by reeves et al .",
    "( 2001b ) and pounds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are only significant between 5 and 8 kev ( see fig . 4 of pounds et al .",
    "2001 ) , so the 3 - 10 kev energy range allows a good measurement of the continuum on either side of fe k , while excluding the noisier and less - well calibrated data at higher energies and the complex spectrum found at lower energies .",
    "we included the small effect of absorption from the galaxy as a component in all our spectral modelling ( @xmath5 @xmath6 towards mrk  205 and @xmath7 @xmath6 towards mrk  509 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the results of the spectral fits are given in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "we began by fitting a power law model .",
    "the counts spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk205_allspec ] , along with the power law model convolved with the instrument response .",
    "like reeves et al .",
    "( 2001b ) we find this model is a poor fit , and there are significant residuals around 6.4 kev .",
    "we therefore added a gaussian emission line , and obtained an acceptable fit , with a resolved line consistent with 6.4 kev neutral fe k@xmath2 .",
    "although the fit was acceptable , residuals remained at @xmath8 kev , and so we tried further fits including one of three additional model components that might plausibly account for these residuals and improve the fit : a gaussian emission line at @xmath9 kev , a relativistically - broadened accretion disk line ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; the `` diskline '' model in xspec ) , and compton reflection from cold material ( `` pexrav '' in xspec ; magdziarz and zdziarski 1995 ) . in the diskline model",
    "the energy of the line was constrained to lie between 6.7 and 6.9 kev , corresponding to he - like or h - like fe ( as proposed by reeves et al .",
    "2001b ) . in the reflection model",
    "the inclination was fixed at 45@xmath10 , and we assumed solar elemental abundances ( anders and grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "the addition of any of these three components resulted in a similar goodness of fit .",
    "the energies of the second gaussian line and diskline components are found to be consistent with fe  xxvi , and in the case of the diskline the best fit was found for a line produced many @xmath11 from the black hole giving it a narrow profile , similar to that of the gaussian line .",
    "we have also tried more complex models , including two emission lines as well as reflection : the lowest value of @xmath12 was obtained when the second emission line is a gaussian . however , according to the f - test , this is only a 1@xmath13 improvement over the model including a single emission line and compton reflection .      as for mrk  205",
    ", we began with a power law model and obtained a completely unacceptable fit with large residuals around 6.4 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk509_1_allspec ] ) .",
    "addition of a gaussian line at @xmath14 kev resulted in a much better , but still poor fit ( rejected with @xmath15 confidence ) . adding a further gaussian ,",
    "a diskline or a reflection component improved the goodness of fit , which is marginally better when the third model component is a diskline rather than a reflection component or a second gaussian line .",
    "however , whichever additional model component is included the model is still unacceptable at @xmath16 confidence .",
    "we have also tested a more complex model , including a second emission line as well as reflection , and obtain a best @xmath17 for a diskline ; this is only marginally better ( 2@xmath13 according to the f - test ) than the fit with reflection but without the second emission line .",
    "strong residuals at 8.3 and 9.8 kev together contribute @xmath18 to the @xmath19 , and are therefore largely responsible for the poor model fit .",
    "we have no credible explanation for these residuals other than as statistical fluctuations .",
    "a power law model provided a poor fit to the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mrk509_2_allspec ] ) , and once again we found that the addition of a @xmath14 kev emission line resulted in a significantly improved ( and quite acceptable ) @xmath20=124/144 .",
    "the addition of an extra gaussian , diskline or reflection component each improved the fit further , resulting in very a good fit .",
    "however , the addition of a second emission line to the reflection model results in no further improvement in @xmath20 .",
    "the overall spectral shape of mrk  509 is extremely similar in the two observations , and so to improve signal to noise we have coadded the data from both observations .",
    "a model containing only a power law is convincingly rejected , but a power law and a single gaussian provide an acceptable fit to the data . adding an additional gaussian , diskline or reflection component makes a significant improvement to the @xmath20 ( at @xmath21 significance according to the f - test ) , resulting in a good fit to the data . finally , we have tried more complex models combining reflection with a second gaussian or accretion - disc emission line . in this case",
    "the @xmath20 is poorer than for the model including reflection without a second emission line .",
    "the most significant spectral feature in all the 3 - 10 kev epic spectra of mrk  205 and mrk  509 is low - ionization fe  k@xmath2 emission at 6.4 kev . in both sources ,",
    "improved fits are obtained when an additional emission component is included , peaking at slightly higher energy ; gaussian or relativistic emission lines or cold reflection are all plausible forms for this additional spectral component . for mrk  509",
    ", the spectral modelling requires that the 6.4 kev line is broad , fwhm  @xmath22  km  s@xmath23 unless this additional component is included .",
    "more complex models , combining a second emission line with cold reflection , do not produce significantly better fits for any of the spectra than models with cold reflection but without a second emission line .",
    "the 6.4 kev emission is a signature of reprocessing by cold material , but where does this reprocessing take place ? both galaxies show negligible intrinsic absorption in soft x  rays , and hence the material responsible for the 6.4 kev emission must lie outside the line of sight to the continuum source .",
    "possible locations include the accretion disk , the molecular torus favoured by agn unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 ) , and the ( optical ) broad line clouds .",
    "the molecular torus and the accretion disk represent compton thick targets , and reprocessing at these locations will result in a compton reflection component with an edge at 7.1 kev as well as fe k@xmath2 line emission ( matt , perola & piro 1991 , george and fabian 1991 ) .",
    "however , the broad line clouds are expected to be compton thin ( shields , ferland & peterson 1995 ) and therefore the fe k@xmath2 line emission will not be accompanied by significant compton scattered continuum .    simulations by leahy and creighton ( 1993 , see also yaqoob et al .",
    "2001 ) show that if the broad - line clouds have column densities of @xmath24  @xmath6 , they would need to cover 50% of the sky , as seen by the continuum source , to produce the fe k@xmath2 line of 50 ev equivalent width in mrk  509 . to produce the 100 ev equivalent width line seen in mrk  205 , the broad line clouds would need to surround @xmath25 of the central source .",
    "these covering fractions are much higher than the typical broad line region covering fractions deduced from the ultraviolet ( 10%  25% , davidson & netzer 1979 , goad & koratkar 1998 ) , suggesting that the broad line regions are probably not responsible for the majority of the fe k@xmath2 photons . furthermore in mrk  509 , even if the broad line region does produce the fe k@xmath2 line , something else must contribute an additional broad spectral component at slightly higher energy , or else the velocity width of the fe k@xmath2 line is inconsistent with the width of the optical lines , which have fwhm of only 2270 km s@xmath23 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the fe k@xmath2 line originates in compton thick material , the equivalent width of the line suggests that this material intercepts @xmath26 30  60 per cent of the emitted radiation in mrk  205 , and about half as much in mrk  509 ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "therefore in both agn the strength of the fe k@xmath2 line alone suggests that a significant compton reflection component should be present .",
    "when reflection is included in the fit we find that @xmath27 of the radiation is intercepted by the reflector in mrk  205 , and @xmath28 in mrk  509 , slightly higher than inferred from the fe k@xmath2 line but not greatly so .",
    "thus a compton thick reprocessor that intercepts a significant fraction of the primary x - rays can account for all the fe k features in mrk  205 or mrk  509 .",
    "this reprocessor could be a distant molecular torus , or the accretion disk itself .",
    "however , the velocity width of the fe k@xmath2 line implies that even if the reprocessor is the accretion disk , little of the reprocessed emission comes from the inner , relativistic , parts of the disk .",
    "so what evidence do we have for emission from highly ionized fe , potentially in an accretion disk ?",
    "for mrk  205 , the fits with a second emission line are as good as those including a reflection component .",
    "however the second emission line is narrow when it is modeled as a gaussian , and similarly the best fit accretion disk line is one in which the emission is dominated from material in the outer disk , resulting in a narrow line .",
    "hence even if the spectrum of mrk  205 _ does _ include fe  xxv or fe  xxvi , there is no evidence for relativistic broadening .    for mrk  509 ,",
    "the best - fit second emission line is broad , whether it is modeled as a gaussian or as a disk line , and the steep emissivity index implies that most of the emission would come from the inner part of the disk .",
    "the disk would have an inclination of between 20 and 40 degrees , in agreement with the findings of pounds et al .",
    "however , the @xmath20 for the fits including an accretion disk line are only slightly better than the fits including compton reflection for the first observation of mrk  509 , and are slightly poorer for the second observation ; the combined spectrum is as well fit by either model .",
    "hence although the features in the spectrum of mrk  509 can be fit with a model including both a distant , cold , compton - thin reprocessor and relativistically broadened emission from highly ionised fe in an accretion disk , they can be fit equally well by reprocessing and compton reflection from distant , cold material .",
    "thus in both mrk  205 and mrk  509 , we find that the fe  k features can be explained by a single phase compton thick cold reflector .",
    "while the presence of reflection from the highly ionized , high velocity , inner parts of an accretion disk is not ruled out by these data , it is not unambiguously detected .",
    "we have analysed the 3 - 10 kev _ xmm - newton _  epic spectra of mrk  205 and mrk  509 to investigate the fe k features in these objects .",
    "acceptable fits can be obtained for models containing nothing more than a power law and an emission line at 6.4 kev , consistent with cold fe k@xmath2 . however , better fits are obtained when an additional spectral component is included in the model , either compton reflection from cold material or an emission line from ionised fe ; the goodness of fit is similar whichever component is added . in mrk  205 , there is no evidence for relativistic broadening of any emission line , but in mrk  509 the best fit parameters for an ionised fe emission line suggest that it might originate in the inner regions of an accretion disk .",
    "however , illumination of distant , cold material provides a simpler , self consistent explanation of the spectral features than models including reflection from highly ionized , relativistic material .",
    "therefore , contrary to pounds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and reeves et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , we do not find strong evidence in either object for reprocessing in the highly ionised inner parts of an accretion disk .",
    "based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
