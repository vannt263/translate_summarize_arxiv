    "a reformulation of the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling hamiltonian in terms of non - abelian gauge fields  @xcite was explicitly given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the so interaction is presented as a @xmath1 gauge theory . as the yang - mills gauge theory is well understood and is the underpinning of well established theory , enormous insight can be brought upon new problems .",
    "such gauge point of view , in more general terms , has been known for some time  @xcite .",
    "this formulation is very revealing , since the consistent gauge structure of the theory becomes obvious and the physics of spin currents , persistent currents and color diamagnetism  @xcite can be understood in a manner analogous to the well known @xmath2 gauge theories .",
    "a consistent @xmath1 gauge approach was presented in reference @xcite where it was found that for the pauli type hamiltonians ( including rashba and two - dimensional reductions of the dresselhaus hamiltonian ) , gauge symmetry breaking ( gsb ) is necessarily built into the theory and leads to vanishing of the spin conductivity in constant electric fields  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the yang mills interpretation of the rashba and dresselhaus so interactions renders the associated gauge fields real , with topological consequences analogous to the aharonov casher effect  @xcite .",
    "the rashba and dresselhaus so interactions arise in materials which lack either structural or bulk inversion symmetry , respectively  @xcite .",
    "these two kinds of interactions have recently been given a great deal of attention due to their potential role in the generation and manipulation of spin polarized currents , spin filters  @xcite , spin accumulation  @xcite , and spin optics  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction may be defined as the interaction of the spin magnetic moment of the electron , @xmath3 with the magnetic field produced by all external moving charges in the electron rest frame . here , @xmath4 is the spin of the electron with @xmath5 the vector of pauli matrices , @xmath6 the land factor , @xmath7 the electron rest mass and @xmath8 the electron electric charge .",
    "bold face symbols denote matrices in spin space . in the rest frame of the external charges ,",
    "the so interaction , properly corrected to take into account thomas precession , is usually described by the pauli term , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the potential energy of the electron in the presence of the external charges . for a spherically symmetric potential , @xmath11 and the",
    "so interaction is proportional to @xmath12 , hence its name .    in a semi - conductor",
    ", the electron rest mass and the land factor must be replaced by their effective counterparts , and the spin - orbit interaction can thus be considerably enhanced . moreover ,",
    "an appropriate basis in a crystalline solid is given in terms of the bloch wave functions , @xmath13 , and the so interaction must be calculated in this basis .",
    "this is generally a hard task and one usually uses phenomenological expressions compatible with the crystal symmetries . when there is bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) , we have the dresselhaus expression in @xmath14 systems  @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for cyclic permutations .",
    "when the electrons are confined in two dimensions , the expectation value along the third dimension should be considered , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the typical confinment length in the @xmath20direction .",
    "the dresselhaus so interaction thus takes the simple form @xmath21 where we neglect cubic terms in @xmath22 .",
    "if the confining potential is not symmetric i.e. in the case of space inversion asymmetry ( sia ) , there is another term which directly follows from the expression @xmath23 with only the @xmath24 contribution .",
    "this term is known as the rashba so interaction , @xmath25 note that the rashba so amplitude can be tuned experimentally using a gate voltage , since the coefficient @xmath26 is proportional to the electric field . for more details on so interactions in semi - conductors ,",
    "see refs .  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the pauli so interaction .",
    "rashba and dresselhaus so interactions will be treated later . neglecting electron - electron interactions , we start by considering the pauli hamiltonian to order @xmath27 , acting on two - component spinors , @xmath28\\nbone_{2\\times 2 }   -\\bigl[\\frac{{\\vec p\\ \\!}^4}{8m^3c^2 } + \\frac{e\\hbar^2}{8m^2c^2}\\nabla\\cdot{\\vec e}\\bigr ] \\nbone_{2\\times 2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}{\\vec \\bsigma}\\cdot { \\vec b } -\\frac{e\\hbar{\\vec \\bsigma}\\cdot ( { \\vec p}-e{\\vec a})\\times{\\vec e}}{4m^2c^2 } \\mbox{},\\label{paulifirst}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term in the first line corresponds to the usual schrdinger equation including the kinetic energy with a mininal coupling to the electromagnetic field , the substrate potential denoted by @xmath10 , that can be assumed periodic , and a scalar potential contribution .",
    "the second term in the first line describes the first relativistic correction to the kinetic energy and the darwin term , where @xmath29 is the electric field and @xmath30 the speed of light .",
    "these first two terms are proportional to the @xmath31 identity matrix in spin space .",
    "the second line comprises explicitly spin - dependent terms , first the zeeman interaction where @xmath32 is the magnetic field and @xmath33 is the pauli matrix vector and the second term is the spin - orbit interaction , now written with the minimal coupling to the gauge vector .",
    "we have assumed a static potential so that the rotor of the electric field is absent and the spin - orbit interaction is limited to the term mentioned here . in the following ,",
    "we absorb the spin - independent one - body interactions ( second term of first line in eq .  [ paulifirst ] ) in the potential , and we rewrite the non relativistic kinetic energy plus the spin - orbit interaction as + s.o.&=&12 m + & = & 12m^2 -||^2 .",
    "this suggests an @xmath1 form described by non - abelian @xmath34 and ordinary abelian gauge fields @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and we can rewrite the hamiltonian , following jin , li and zhang  @xcite as @xmath38 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac 1{8m}g^2{\\vec w}^a{\\vec w}^a\\nbone_{2\\times 2 } -gcw^{0a}\\btau^a+(v'-eca^0)\\nbone_{2\\times 2 } , \\label{paulisecond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the zeeman interaction is written as the time component of the non - abelian gauge field  @xcite @xmath39 , while the space components of this @xmath40 connection are defined by @xmath41 , or explicitly , gw^1&=&(e_z - e_y ) , + gw^2&=&(-e_z+e_x ) , + gw^3&=&(e_y - e_x ) . with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 unit vectors in the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath20directions . the @xmath31 matrices @xmath47 are the symmetry generators for @xmath40 obeying the commutation relation @xmath48=i\\varepsilon_{abc}\\btau^c$ ] , @xmath49 being the totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath50 is fixed by the combination @xmath51 which has the dimensions of @xmath52 , and we choose @xmath53 .",

    "the superscripts of the beginning of the latin alphabet , @xmath56 refer to the internal spin degrees of freedom for which we use the convention of summation when they are repeated , while greek indices @xmath57 correspond to space - time components and run from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , the time component corresponding to @xmath58 and the space components being also denoted as latin indices from the middle of the alphabet , @xmath60 ,  this formulation differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite most importantly in the term quadratic in @xmath61 in equation  [ paulisecond ] .",
    "the purpose of writing the second term here , as a function of the @xmath40 connection is to evidence _ gauge symmetry breaking _ ( gsb ) in this hamiltonian .",
    "this observation has important consequences in the physical interpretation of the resulting yang - mills fields and is the reason why the yang - mills fields themselves are observable quantities , where as in a gauge symmetric theory they would be gauge dependent  @xcite .    in order to generate the noether currents in a canonical fashion",
    ", one must formulate the appropriate lagrangian for the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "the non - relativistic lagrangian density we seek is ( now omitting identity matrices ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a pauli spinor @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the @xmath40 and @xmath2 field tensors respectively .",
    "the new term @xmath67 is due to gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the covariant derivative is then of the form @xmath68 .",
    "this form of the covariant derivative determines the well known @xmath2 coupling constant @xmath69 and the @xmath40 coupling constant for this theory is @xmath70 .",
    "a gauge transformation of the lagrangian density would leave it unchanged up to a divergence at the condition that the coulomb gauge for the @xmath40 connection is satisfied , @xmath71 .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ paulisecond ] is derived from the corresponding lagrange equations for the matter fields @xmath63 .",
    "the equations of motion of the yang - mills fields in the presence of currents ( generalized maxwell equations ) follow from euler - lagrange equations with respect to variations of the gauge fields , @xmath72 the l.h.s",
    ". of this equation gives @xmath73 , and since the non - abelian field tensor @xmath74 is antisymmetric with respect to space - time indices , it is natural to introduce a conserved current @xmath75 .",
    "the conserved current @xmath76  @xcite is the full spin current carried both by matter and radiation i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "this full current is an observable physical quantity , since the gauge is fixed in the present case ( in contradistinction with ordinary @xmath40 gauge theory where it is gauge - dependent ) .",

    "matter^a = ( g/2)^(^a v+v^a ) , where @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "\\ii ) the second term comes from the gauge symmetry breaking contribution .",
    "it depends on both matter and radiation .",
    "\\iii ) finally , the third term is the canonical radiative contribution originating from the derivative with respect to the gauge potential of the non - abelian contribution of the field tensor @xmath81 .",
    "note that this last term would not arise in an abelian theory ( e.g. in @xmath2 , since the photon does not carry any electric charge ) .",
    "the first and last terms were described in ref .",
    "@xcite as taken from an apparently gauge symmetric form .",
    "the magnetization term has both a material contribution ( the first term ) and a radiative contribution as both matter and radiation carry angular momentum .",
    "we emphasize that , the extent to which gauge symmetry is broken depends on the choice of the electric field . if only the @xmath82 , then one allows gauge transformations that leave @xmath83 invariant .",
    "this is analogous to the remnant @xmath84 group after @xmath2 gsb in superconductors and a similar situation in the electro - weak gsb mechanism  @xcite .",
    "since the gauge theory considered here is non - abelian , in the most general case the corresponding current is not gauge invariant ( as it would be in the @xmath2 case i.e. electromagnetism ) and thus a function that is not measurable  @xcite .",
    "an important property in the so case is that the gauge field is determined by the physical electric field , and thus the gauge is fixed and the spin current becomes properly defined . the third term in eq .",
    "[ eqcurrent ] , which has the structure of a gauge symmetry breaking term , would also by itself fix the gauge and it has further consequences to be discussed below .    rewriting the last term in eq.[totalspatialcurrent ] in terms of ordinary derivatives plus a gauge dependent term we obtain --^ ( ^a)the second term is the non - abelian analog of the london term in superconductivity",
    ". the main result of this approach is then to recognize that such second term exactly cancels the symmetry breaking term in eq.[totalspatialcurrent ] and renders _ zero _ matter currents proportional to the electric field ( zero spin conductivity in arbitrary space dimension ) .",
    "the scenario is now very different from superconductivity : there , the london term is the only one remaining after symmetry breaking , while for the non - abelian case , the london contribution gets cancelled . as discussed in references @xcite , equilibrium currents remain in relation to the leftover radiative contribution , cubic in the non - abelian potential plus a field independent matter contribution .",
    "in order to discuss an analogy , we will consider the simpler case of the @xmath2 abelian gauge theory .",
    "then , the lagrangian density reads as  @xcite = i^*_t-12m(-i)^ * ( -i)-^*(e)+12_0b^2- 12_0e^2[l - abelian ] and minimization of the action with respect to the gauge field leads to ( ^*-^ * ) -ma^*-1_0=0 from which the charge current density follows = ( ^*(-i ) + ( -i)^ * ) -ma^*.[eq - ju1 ] the first term is usually referred to as the paramagnetic term , while the second term is responsible for diamagnetic properties of matter .",
    "if one would have changed the lagrangian in eq .",
    "[ l - abelian ] , adding a gsb term as + ^2^ * , the current would have been changed to its paramagnetic contribution only , _",
    "i.e. _ without any dependence on the gauge field ( no second term in the r.h.s . of equation  [ eq - ju1 ] ) .",
    "this is what occurs , as a first approximation , in a paramagnetic metal in a weak magnetic field .",
    "the cancellation of this diamagnetic term corresponds to the similar scenario of the vanishing of any spin hall effect in the pauli so case .",
    "as we have mentioned , the presence of the gauge symmetry breaking term in the lagrangian density exactly compensates the `` diamagnetic '' ( also called diacolor ) term in the spin current density , and therefore there can not be any spin current proportional to the electric field  @xcite .",
    "this means that the spin hall conductivity identically vanishes , and this result is true in arbitrary dimensions . in the particular case of a two - dimensional system with rashba so interaction ,",
    "rashba has shown , using sum rule arguments , that there is no spin hall conductivity  @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is more general in the sense that in any dimension we obtain a spin hall conductivity which vanishes due to an exact cancellation between two terms . in two dimensions , the situation is special in the sense that both terms do in fact vanish already !",
    "we now consider a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is a crystal , and we analyze the consequence of periodicity in the real space .",
    "if we consider the transport of the spinor  @xcite along the primitive cell of the crystal , we have to form quantities like , in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to transport along vectors @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( or along @xmath86 , then along @xmath85 ) in a uniform external electric field , the commutator @xmath87 $ ] should be considered , where @xmath88 .",
    "this commutator can be shown to be proportional to @xmath89 , thus @xmath87 $ ] vanishes when @xmath90 is in the plane of the 2deg  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath90 is perpendicular to the plane , a quantization condition appears for the voltage along at least an arm of the elementary cell , say the arm @xmath19 e_za = pmc^2/e with @xmath91 an integer .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 plays the role of a quantum of voltage similar to the flux quantum in the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite .",
    "the analogy is nevertheless not complete , and there are important differences . while the gauge invariant phase in the ab effect is given by @xmath93 along a closed path , in the present situation the corresponding quantity reduces to the integral along an open path , @xmath94 .",
    "this is of course due to the fact that the non - abelian gauge field is given by the electric field itself , which is gauge invariant already ( and there is no need to close the path to render the phase gauge invariant ) .",
    "the present case is thus more similar to the aharonov - casher effect  @xcite .",
    "let us mention that in a semi - conductor , using the effective mass of the electron instead of its bare mass , the quantum of voltage would be considerably reduced .      in this section",
    "we consider an electronic mach - zehnder interferometer where electron beams can interfere and are then collected in two distinct detectors  @xcite .",
    "a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the interferometer creates a gauge vector @xmath95 in the whole space .",
    "the magnetic field could be limited to a narrow area and does not `` touch '' the arms of the interferometer . in the illustrative case below we consider that the electron mirrors and beam splitters , realized by gate potentials , are diagonal in spin space , i.e. they do not mix spin components .",
    "consideration of the changes in the electron propagation direction on the spin components  @xcite does not change the qualitative scenario drawn below .",
    "let us first consider the aharonov - bohm situation where the spin of the electrons is neglected , and we only discuss the case of one detector .",
    "the electrons can follow one of the two paths called i and ii in fig .",
    "[ figmz ] .",

    "in order to calculate the probability amplitude in the detector , we have now to evaluate quantities like ( i^-1_i_y dy ) ( i^-1_i_x dx ) with @xmath97 ( take care to the non standard definition here , in order to shorten the expression of the comparator operator  @xcite ) . using the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula and the fact that the commutator @xmath98",
    "$ ] is a @xmath99number , this is equivalent to ( i^-1(_i_y dy+_i_x dx ) -12(i^-1)^2_idy_i dx[_y,_x ] ) .[eq24 ] the interferences are due to the last term involving @xmath100=[p_y+ea_y , p_x+ea_x]=i\\hbar eb$ ] , so the last integral contributes to the phase by an amount @xmath101 with @xmath102 the quantum of magnetic flux ( associated to the charge @xmath103 ) .",
    "eventually , one has _",
    "a&=&(r_2t_1e^i_b/_0+t_2r_1e^-i_b/_0 ) e^i_0 , where the phase @xmath26 comes from the non - interfering contribution in eq .",
    "this result is the standard aharonov - bohm effect which states that the interference pattern is determined by the total magnetic flux enclosed between the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "we now consider a variant of this problem where the spin - orbit interaction is taken into account .",
    "the arms of the interferometer are supposed to be made of a `` rashba - dresselhaus '' active medium  @xcite .    instead of transporting a wave function with a phase variation induced by the coupling of the electron charge to the abelian gauge vector",
    ", we now consider the transport of a pauli spinor and its precession due to the coupling of the electron spin to the non - abelian gauge field . in the case",
    "when both rashba and dresselhaus so interactions are present , the hamiltonian is given by the following expression  @xcite , @xmath104 where @xmath105 . the non - abelian gauge field now takes the form @xmath106 and the spinor transport along the paths of the interferometer is defined by the operator _ a = u_a_0,according to ( here we disregard the fact that the spin components are mixed at each reflection @xcite ) _",

    "again , the evaluation of the previous expressions is made delicate due to non commutativity of the gauge field components ( and their commutator is no longer a simple @xmath99number ) , so the bch formula is now of no use , since it would require the complete nested expression .",
    "we rather use properties of the pauli marices to decompose the exponential functions , @xmath107 . after some algebra ,",

    "the parameter @xmath111 is the length of a single arm of the interferometer ( the two arms are chosen of equal lengths ) .",
    "if the parameter @xmath110 vanishes , the so interaction simply disappears and we are led to the abelian ab situation . if @xmath112 , the operator @xmath113 is diagonal in the input spinor basis , which means that a perfect spin filtering is possible in this original basis if one of the two eigenvalues @xmath114 vanishes ( in which case the corresponding component is filtered and only the other component survives in detector @xmath19 ) . if it is not the case , filtering may still be possible , but in a different basis , tilted from the original one  @xcite .",
    "the traceless condition simplifies the diagonalization of @xmath115 , and the eigenvalues for @xmath116 are easily found to be @xmath117\\mp i\\sin\\lambda\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sqrt{{\\mathcal a}^2_{-}\\sin^2\\lambda\\cos^2 2\\theta+2{\\mathcal a}^2_{+}\\cos^2\\lambda(1+\\sin 2\\theta)}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the filtering condition ( e.g. of the @xmath118 component of the spinor ) is guaranteed by the condition @xmath119 . it can be shown that this condition _ can always be fullfiled _ by a convenient choice of the magnetic flux between the arms of the interferomter .",
    "as we have discussed above , an interesting feature is that , depending on the value of @xmath110 ( remember that the rashba amplitude can be tuned experimentally ) , it is possible to achieve this condition in a non tilted basis .",
    "when the perfect filtering condition is satisfied , the amplitude of the non filtered component is obtained via the other eigenvalue , @xmath120 . in the following figures we propose illustrations in the most generic case , i.e. the tilted basis , since this is the situation that occurs in general .",
    "in contrast , the condition for perfect filtering in the original basis requires a particular relation between the rashba and dresselhaus amplitudes through the relation @xmath112 .",
    "we thus show contour plots of the magnetic flux which allows for perfect filtering and for the intensity of the non filtered component in the detector in the tilted basis , in the plane @xmath26 , @xmath121 .",
    "we have presented a non abelian gauge theory suited to deal with non relativistic quantum mechanics in the presence of various types of spin - orbit interactions .",
