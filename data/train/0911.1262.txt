    "we tackle the problem of subpixel object detection in image sequences which arises for instance in infrared search and track ( irst ) applications . in this context , the target signature is proportional to : @xmath0 = \\int_{i-0.5}^{i+0.5 } \\int_{j-0.5}^{j+0.5 } h_o(u-\\epsilon_1,v-\\epsilon_2 ) \\ , du \\ , dv .",

    "however , contrary to the amplitude @xmath6 which is unknown too , dependence on the location parameter @xmath7 is highly nonlinear .",
    "its influence in our application is rather significant because of aliasing and unless a velocity model is available , object subpixel position is hardly predictable from frame to frame . actually , common sensor design leads to an image spot downsampled by almost a factor 5 .",
    "we can see on figure  [ fig : taches ] the energy loss at central pixel according to subpixel location and the random change in spatial pattern due to aliasing .",
    "sensor design parameter @xmath8 is set to its common value of @xmath9 ( see section  [ sec : application]).,height=170 ]    this phenomenon has a major impact on detection performance as shown thereafter . to our knowledge , this pitfall has not been addressed yet in the literature .",
    "a prevailing opinion stands that there is no signature information in subpixel objects .",
    "indeed , the different authors dealing with small object detection have concentrated on clutter removing @xcite , multi- or hyper - spectral fusion @xcite and multiframe tracking methods @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the processing of a single frame . in section  [ sec : problem ] , we formulate the detection problem in the classical model of a signal in additive gaussian noise ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.2 - 4 ) . when the signal is deterministic , neyman - pearson strategy yields the conventional matched filter . in the present case ,",
    "the signal from the target depends on unknown parameters and we have to deal with a composite hypothesis test . a common procedure is given by the generalized likelihood ratio test .",
    "but the `` nuisance '' parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 can also be considered as random variables with known distributions ( some _ a priori _ density functions in the bayesian terminology ) , then the straightforward extension of the likelihood ratio test is to integrate the conditional distribution over @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "when modelling the signal component as a sample function , we could also think of the class of random signal in noise detection problems , which have essentially been studied in the gaussian case .",
    "unfortunately , considering @xmath10 as a random vector , its empirical distribution proves to be highly non gaussian when @xmath7 is uniformly sampled .",
    "for instance , the histogram of the central pixel depicted on figure  [ fig : histo ] shows that a gaussian fit is not satisfactory at all .",
    "$ ] for a uniformly random position @xmath11.,height=151 ]    in section  [ sec : application ] , we define more precisely the optical system model used in our numerical experiments .",
    "we consider both a gaussian white noise and a fractal noise of unknown correlations generated by a standard technique of spectral synthesis .",
    "section  [ sec : position - estimation ] is devoted to the position estimation problem , i.e. estimation of parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we propose two estimators that take into account the fact that the signal amplitude @xmath6 is also unknown .",
    "we demonstrate the performance of these estimators in terms of mean square errors . as for the detection problem",
    ", we finally illustrate the expected improvement in quality brought by a correctly sampled optics compared to common sensor design .",
    "we consider a local detection window sliding across the image . the problem is to decide whether an object is present or not at the window central pixel .",
    "this is a binary test which typically reads as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the vector collecting the window data , @xmath14 is the object response ( signal vector ) and @xmath15 the additive gaussian noise . the signature shape is known and deterministic , so that @xmath16 only depends on the two unknown parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the noise vector @xmath15 is supposed to be centered ( in practice we first remove the empirical mean from the data ) with a known or previously estimated covariance matrix @xmath19 .",
    "thus , if we assume that @xmath15 is independent from @xmath16 , the following conditional distributions are gaussian : @xmath20    let first assume that parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are given .",
    "the problem amounts to a simple hypothesis test which is to detect a deterministic signal in a gaussian noise .",
    "the neyman - pearson strategy or likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) is given by : @xmath21 it is equivalent to classical matched filtering which simply compares the statistic @xmath22 with some threshold .",
    "the exact object location being unknown in practice , we could assume by default that @xmath23 $ ] , i.e. the object is at the center of the pixel , whereas the true location would correspond to @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the detector which consists in thresholding the pixel matched filter ( pmf ) @xmath25 is optimum provided @xmath26 .",
    "otherwise it is mismatched and therefore suboptimum . since conditional distributions of @xmath27 under each assumption are gaussian , we easily get the expression of the probalility of detection @xmath28 and of false alarm @xmath29 .",
    "corresponding receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves for critical values of @xmath30 are depicted on figure  [ fig : corthq15db ] .",
    "they clearly show that the pmf performances are significantly worse as @xmath31 differs from @xmath30 . but beyond extreme situations ( related to a true target location between two or four pixels instead of the center ) , the `` mean curve '' represents the average statistics over uniformly random positions .",
    "compared to the ideal curve , we can see that the price paid if one neglects the random location is rather high even at favorable signal - to - noise ratio . for a snr of @xmath32db and at a @xmath29 of @xmath33 , probability of detection decreases from nearly @xmath34 to @xmath35 .     in blue ( ideal curve ) , @xmath36 in green and red ( worst case ) , and finally the mean curve in black for uniformly sampled @xmath30 ( snr @xmath37db).,height=170 ]    the object response also depends ( linearly this time ) on the amplitude @xmath6 , which is generally unknown .",
    "yet , assuming strictly positive amplitude , we see that whatever @xmath38 , thresholding @xmath25 gives the same roc curve as thresholding @xmath27 . without any assumption on @xmath6 ,",
    "a classical solution is to estimate it by maximum likelihood ( ml ) .",
    "indeed under the gaussian noise assumption , the optimum in @xmath6 for a given @xmath7 is explicit : @xmath39 and then the `` generalized '' pixel matched filter ( referred to as gpmf ) is equal to @xmath40      our aim is to build refined detectors that improve performance of the above gpmf in taking into account the variability of the object signature due to its random subpixel location .",
    "several solutions may be used .",
    "we first recall the most popular one .",
    "ml estimation of the two unknown parameters leads to the generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) : @xmath41 it consists in estimating the amplitude @xmath6 _ and _ the possible object location @xmath7 by computing : @xmath42 then thresholding the estimated filter @xmath43 where @xmath44 is given by equation ( [ eq : alphaml ] ) : @xmath45      in a bayesian approach , we propose to consider the two unknown parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 as realizations of independent random variables with given probability density functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then the optimal procedure is the exact likelihood ratio test ( elrt ) .    to compute the density function of data under @xmath48 and to get the likelihood ratio",
    ", we have to integrate the conditional density @xmath49 over prior distributions of the nuisance random parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the likelihood ratio can be expressed as : @xmath50 given prior distributions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath51 is the optimal neyman - pearson test whenever @xmath6 and @xmath7 really satisfy the models @xmath46 and @xmath47 . by default",
    "we choose a `` non - informative '' prior for @xmath6 and we adopt a uniform distribution inside the pixel for @xmath7 , which seems to be quite a reasonable assumption for the subpixel target position .",
    "so we get : @xmath52    unfortunately , because of intricate nonlinear dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath7 , explicit integration over @xmath7 appears to be not tractable and probability distribution of @xmath51 is not as simple as the one of @xmath27 . a quadrature approximation is required to compute @xmath51 whereas derivation of its density requires monte - carlo simulations .      in equation ( [ eq : lrprop ] ) , the double integral over @xmath7 can be approximated up to any desired accuracy using some quadrature rule and evaluating the integrand @xmath53 at discrete samples @xmath54 .",
    "but , for sake of computational efficiency , we propose to use a coarsest approximation of the likelihood ratio ( alrt ) based on a bidimensional trapezoidal rule which only involves the @xmath55 half - pixel positions .",
    "one alternative to this probabilistic viewpoint can be built on a geometric approach that restricts the signal vector @xmath14 to vary in some @xmath56-dimensional subspace , with @xmath56 lower than the vector size @xcite .",
    "the observed data under @xmath48 are rewritten as : @xmath57 where the structural matrix @xmath58 is formed by @xmath56 independent vectors @xmath59 .",
    "coefficients @xmath60 of the linear combination are the new parameters that describe the signal variability . thanks to linearity , ml estimation of vector @xmath61 has an explicit solution ( which is identical to the least squares estimator ) : @xmath62 and glrt amounts to threshold the following statistic : @xmath63 matrix @xmath58 only depends on @xmath7 , @xmath6 being a scale parameter . in practice , it is identified by discretizing @xmath64 , making a singular value decomposition and retaining the singular vectors @xmath59 corresponding to the @xmath56 greatest singular values .",
    "we choose @xmath65 which gives better results than higher orders .",
    "therefore under hypothesis @xmath48 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is identical to gpmf with @xmath68 replacing @xmath69 .",
    "in our application , we can model the imaging system by a diffraction - limited , unaberrated optics with circular aperture and incoherent illumination @xcite .",
    "the object signal pattern @xmath10 is then given by the integration of @xmath4 on each pixel ( see equation  [ eq : signal ] ) , where @xmath4 is the radial point spread function ( psf ) defined by the airy disk : @xmath70 ^ 2 , \\quad \\rho=\\sqrt{u^2+v^2}. \\label{eq : ho}\\ ] ] @xmath71 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath72 designates the normalized cut - off frequency ( @xmath73 is the sampling frequency and @xmath74 is the radial cut - off frequency defined by the ratio of the lens aperture diameter @xmath75 over the wavelength @xmath76 ) . figure  [ fig : psf ] depicts the two - dimensional psf and a slice along one diameter , as well as their fourier transform .",
    "common sensor design uses @xmath77 so that the pixel size is equal to the width of the main lobe of the psf .",
    "however , this implies a downsampling factor of @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 is the nyquist frequency ) . in the following section",
    ", we present some numerical results of detection performance considering this classical sensor design .",
    "examples of image spots @xmath10 have been represented on figure  [ fig : taches ] for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "we have the following property : @xmath80 = \\int_{\\mathbbm{r}^2 } h_o(u , v ) \\,du \\,dv = 1.\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented the detection problem of subpixel objects embedded in additive gaussian noise .",
    "subpixel location and signal amplitude are assumed to be unknown .",
    "unknown subpixel location has a great influence on detection performance in the aliased case while conventional matched filter neglects it .",
    "thus , we derived four types of improved detectors from the likelihood ratio : the glrt , the elrt , the alrt and the sm - glrt .",
    "we have illustrated their performance in comparison with the more classical gpmf .",
    "numerical results for both white and correlated noise cases show that the elrt , the alrt and the glrt are competitive whereas the sm - glrt does not reach the same quality but slightly improves the performance of the gpmf too .",
    "the alrt seems to be a good trade - off since it is not as computionnally demanding as the elrt and the glrt .",
    "moreover the performance gain proves to be only moderate in the case of unaliased optics .",
    "this conclusion has important consequence in sensor design : it suggests that the popular design of a pixel covering exactly the main lobe of the airy disk is not optimum for point object detection .",
    "future work consists in studying the robustness of these detectors to real data and the way we can take into account non gaussian distributions of background noise . as far as the position estimation problem is concerned , we have demonstrated prospective gains that must also be confirmed on more realistic data ."
