    "understanding the quantum dynamics of the spacetime geometry near a spacelike ( cosmological ) singularity , such as the big bang singularity that gave birth to our universe , is one of the key problems of gravitational physics .",

    ".    the first aim of the present work will be to remedy this situation , _",
    "i.e. _   to provide a complete description of the solution space of the quantum supersymmetric bianchi ix model",
    ". this will be done by using a new approach to the quantum dynamics of supersymmetric bianchi models that generalizes the formalism we used in @xcite to study the quantum dynamics of einstein  dirac bianchi universes .",
    "it differs from the formalisms used in previous works  @xcite in describing the gravity degrees of freedom entirely in terms of the metric components @xmath8 , _ without _ making use of an arbitrary , local vielbein .",
    "we use the symmetry properties of bianchi models to uniquely determine a specific vielbein @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) as a local function of @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , we gauge - fix from the start the six extra degrees of freedom contained in @xmath9 that could describe arbitrary local lorentz rotations .",
    "this gauge - fixing of the local @xmath11 gauge symmetry eliminates the need of the usual formalisms  @xcite to impose the six local lorentz constraints @xmath12 .",
    "another specificity of our formalism will be to describe the degrees of freedom of the gravitino by means of a dirac - like gamma - matrix representation .",

    "by contrast , the present work will treat the ( spatially homogeneous ) gravitino @xmath18 as a quantum fermionic operator ( satisfying anti - commutation conditions ) , and will keep all the nonlinearities in the fermions predicted by supergravity .",

    "near a symmetry wall @xmath1562 of the solutions of the @xmath1484-sector susy constraints shows that the general solution is a superposition of two types of solutions : a _ regular _ solution where the symmetric tensor @xmath928 behaves like @xmath1563 as @xmath1564 , and a _ singular _ solution where @xmath928 behaves like @xmath1565 . as was already mentioned above , the fact that there exist conserved dirac - like currents that are bilinear in the wavefunction ( _ i.e. _ bilinear in @xmath928 for the present case ) suggests that we should impose that @xmath928 is square integrable when integrated over a spacelike section in @xmath89-space ( say @xmath1566 ) .",
