    "nonuniform codes are known to be good in terms of approaching the capacity of a channel affected by additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "they have been used already in early - state signal transmission , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the so - called _ codec _ transmission , and are present more recently in the digital video broadcasting next generation handheld ( dvb - ngh ) standard @xcite . unfortunately , nonuniform codes are in general subject to brute - force maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding methods , resulting in a linear decoding complexity in the codebook size .",
    "recently , in @xcite and @xcite , a family of nonlinear and nonuniform _ fuchsian codes _ were constructed based on fuchsian groups of the first kind defined from quaternion algebras over @xmath1 .",
    "the decoding procedure of these codes is based on a modified point reduction algorithm having logarithmic complexity in the codebook size , which was shown to imply logarithmic decoding complexity for the fuchsian codes @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will study one of the key features of a _ code _ , namely its ability to carry information .",
    "in other words , how many bits per channel use we will be able to send when using a given code . here",
    ", we will do this in conjunction with fuchsian codes . to this end , let us start with the following intuitive definition , which will be formalized later ( cf .",
    "[ defncoderate ] ) .",
    "let @xmath2 denote a codebook of size @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 denote the number of independent integers embedded in each codeword .",
    "the _ code rate _ is @xmath5 ( independent integer ) symbols per channel use ( spcu ) .",
    "the _ data rate _ is @xmath6 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) .",
    "the code rate can be thought of as the ability of the code to compress information , and the data rate as the transmission speed enabled by the code .    when encoding over multiple channel uses , as is the case for lattice codes and space  time codes @xcite , the suitable definition for code rate is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of channel uses . with @xmath9 ,",
    "this coincides with the definition above .",
    "apart from the sub - linear decoding complexity , another advantage of the fuchsian codes in @xcite is that they allow , in the sense of the above definition , to compress information .",
    "namely , they enable us to embed three independent integers in one complex number to be transmitted , having thus code rate @xmath10 . in comparison to the usual way of transmitting a complex signal , _",
    "e.g. _ , by using the quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) consisting of a finite subset of gaussian integers @xmath11=\\{c = a+bi\\ , |\\ , a , b\\in\\mathbb{z}\\}\\ ] ] embedding only two independent integers , the rate of a fuchsian code @xcite is 50% higher .",
    "the algebraic reason for the higher rate will become evident in section 3 .    in what follows , we will consider quaternion algebras defined over totally real field extensions of @xmath1 of degree bigger than @xmath12 . as we will see",
    ", this implies that we can increase the code rate even further .",
    "since the point reduction algorithm works in general for arithmetic fuchsian groups , we have adapted it to some explicit groups derived from the arithmetic fuchsian groups of signature @xmath0 .",
    "these groups allow us to construct fuchsian codes with higher rates .",
    "we will show explicit examples of a rate six code , and our method can indeed produce fully explicit codes of rate up to @xmath13 .",
    "the motivation for increasing the code rate initially came for lattice coding @xcite . for lattice codes ,",
    "higher code rate typically implies higher data rates ( or equivalently , bigger codebook , cf .",
    "def . 1.1 . ) without having to increase the transmission power or to compromise the minimum distance . as the transmission power is determined by the euclidean norm of the transmitted codeword , this results from the fact that a higher rank lattice with a unit volume has more points within a euclidean hypercube of a given edge length than a lower rank lattice with a unit volume . to get an intuition",
    ", one can think of how many integer points are there in the real line between , say , 0 and 10 , versus how many integral points are there in a @xmath14 cube in @xmath15 .",
    "the same is naturally valid for euclidean hyperspheres .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to maximize the code rate .",
    "for the proposed higher rate fuchsian codes there is a caveat : due to the nonlinear and nonuniform structure , there is no _ a priori _ reason why higher rate should imply a bigger codebook .",
    "it seems difficult to give a rigorous proof for this , so we have settled with numerical experiments to see how the rate affects the codebook size . in our example cases ,",
    "higher rate seems to indeed imply a bigger codebook , given the minimum distance and the hypersphere radius .",
    "our interest in fuchsian groups as a basis for code construction stems from a series of recent papers by palazzo _",
    "_ in @xcite , among others , various interesting connections between fuchsian groups and signal constellation design are presented . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors construct fuchsian groups suitable for signal constellation design . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider the unit disk model of the hyperbolic plane as the signal space , and the noise is modeled as a hyperbolic gaussian random variable . by using some results of hyperbolic geometry they construct a hyperbolic equivalent to qam and psk constellations and point out that , when the channel model is hyperbolic ( this is the case _",
    "e.g. _ in power transmission line communications @xcite ) , the proposed hyperbolic constellations provide higher coding gains than the classical euclidean variants . building on this work , in @xcite",
    "the authors construct dense tessellations and count dirichlet domains attached to certain families of these tessellations . in @xcite",
    "the authors use units of quaternion orders to construct space - time matrices with the potential use case being wireless multi - antenna ( mimo ) communications .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite as the early references to the use of division algebras and maximal orders in mimo .",
    "although codes related to fuchsian groups had been considered before , our approach in @xcite was original in that it described a complete construction and decoding process , whereas earlier work had largely concentrated on the constellation design while giving little attention to the decoding and performance aspects .",
    "another key difference to the aforementioned works was , as is the case of the present paper , that we are studying codes on the _ complex plane _ arising from quaternion algebras and fuchsian groups , and our aim is to apply the codes to the classical ( euclidean ) channel models such as the aforementioned awgn channel , with possible future extension to fading channels .",
    "we do not use hyperbolic metric as our design metric , but use the fuchsian group as a starting point to the code generation .",
    "nevertheless , our decoder will rely on hyperbolic geometry as opposed to the classical decoders based on euclidean geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give some background and notation on fuchsian groups acting on the complex upper half - plane , specially those coming from quaternion algebras over a number field @xmath16 , in a more general setting than @xcite and @xcite . in section 3 , we generalize the construction of fuchsian codes in order to obtain codes of arbitrarily high rates . in particular , by using quaternion algebras over totally real extensions @xmath17 , we prove that the code rate is at least @xmath18 , where @xmath19 $ ] is the degree of the base field . in section @xmath20 , we explore such fuchsian codes for a number of fuchsian groups derived from those of signature @xmath0 , classified by takeuchi @xcite . this task has required to explicitly construct suitable fundamental domains for these groups and to adapt the point reduction algorithm @xcite to our case .",
    "we also provide some numerical evidence to justify the study of higher rate fuchsian codes by showing that increasing the rate may indeed increase the codebook size and hence the data rate . in the last section ,",
    "we expose the conclusions and discuss directions for future research .",
    "next we review some algebraic concepts and results related to fuchsian groups acting on the complex upper half - plane , in particular those arising from quaternion algebras over a number field @xmath16 , thus extending our work in @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath21 the special linear group of @xmath22-matrices with entries in @xmath23 and determinant equal to 1 .",
    "there is a group action on the riemann sphere @xmath24 defined by :    @xmath25    these maps @xmath26 are called _ fractional linear transformations _ or _ mbius transformations _ of the riemann sphere .",
    "the unique matrices fixing all the points are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 acts faithfully on @xmath30 , that is to say , each element other than the identity acts nontrivially .",
    "the complex upper half - plane @xmath31 is stable under this action .",
    "in fact the mbius transformations are the group of isometries of @xmath32 with respect to the hyperbolic geometry .",
    "we will consider discrete subgroups of @xmath33 with a proper and discontinuous action on @xmath32 such that the hyperbolic volume of the quotient of @xmath32 by that action is finite .",
    "these groups are called fuchsian groups of the first kind , fuchsian groups in short . by abuse of notation",
    ", we will use the same notation for the groups in @xmath21 and @xmath29 .",
    "let us also recall that whenever a group acts on a set , it divides the set into equivalence classes .    for a fuchsian group @xmath34 , a fundamental domain is a closed hyperbolic polygon @xmath35 in @xmath32 satisfying :    * for any @xmath36 in the interior of @xmath35 , if there exists @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , then @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "* for any @xmath41 , there exists @xmath42 and @xmath37 such that @xmath43 .",
    "each election of a fundamental domain for the action of a fuchsian group @xmath34 leads to a regular tessellation of the upper half - plane by hyperbolic polygons , which will be useful for the code construction .",
    "in fact the unlimited number of tessellations is one of the advantages of the hyperbolic plane compared to the euclidean one .    given a fundamental domain of @xmath34 and @xmath41 , the problem of finding @xmath42 and @xmath37 such that @xmath43 is known as the _ point reduction problem _ and requires an algorithmic solution referred to as the point reduction algorithm .",
    "here , we will consider tessellations obtained from fuchsian groups arising from quaternion algebras .",
    "let @xmath16 be an arbitrary field with @xmath44 .",
    "the quaternion algebra @xmath45 denoted by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , is the @xmath16-algebra with @xmath16-basis @xmath48 subject to the multiplication rules @xmath49 . for more details on quaternion algebras , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    in a quaternion algebra",
    ", there is a natural conjugation such that for @xmath50 the conjugate is @xmath51 .",

    "let @xmath34 be a fuchsian group as in section 2.1 .",
    "the first step in the construction of the code is to fix a fundamental domain @xmath124 , which determines a tessellation of the complex upper half - plane @xmath32 , and a set @xmath125 whose corresponding isometry circles are the edges of the fundamental domain , following the notation in section 2 .",
    "the main step in the process is to choose a set of @xmath126 different elements in @xmath34 , @xmath127 , what is equivalent to choosing @xmath126 different tiles in the tessellation .",

    "we can double the number of points by expanding to the lower half - plane in a natural way by including the opposites @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the codebook consists of the @xmath134 complex points constructed by using @xmath128 and @xmath135 , and the symmetry with respect to the origin .",
