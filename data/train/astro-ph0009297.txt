    "recently , the new nacre compilation of thermonuclear rates@xcite has been published and observations of light isotopes have flourished .",

    ", the bbn network is constituted by about 60 reactions@xcite out of which , 22 are included in the nacre compilation .",
    "the main improvements with respect to former compilations concern a better traceability to the source of nuclear data and the availability of upper and lower rate limits .",
    "the primordial abundances of the light elements @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath4 are governed by the expansion rate of the universe and the cooling it induces . under the classical assumptions , these abundances depend only on the baryon to photon ratio @xmath10 , related to the baryonic parameter by @xmath11 with @xmath12 km / s.mpc",

    "the primordial abundance of @xmath2 , @xmath17 is measured in low metallicity extragalactic hii regions and in hii regions in the small magellanic cloud .",

    "the observations of the lyman alpha forest clouds between the redshifts 0 and 5 , lead to a corresponding @xmath32 , taking into account the uncertainty related to ionized hydrogen@xcite .",
