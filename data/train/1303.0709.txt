    "however , mh1 in the layered structure of lasrfeo@xmath1 corresponds to a transfer from @xmath75 to @xmath73 , thus it is @xmath133 lower in energy than in cubic approximation . in comparison ,",
    "the lowest mh excitation in lasrmno@xmath1 requires the opposite transfer from @xmath73 to @xmath75 , raising the excitation energy to @xmath134 . in lasrmno@xmath1 , this mh excitation is observed at @xmath135ev.@xcite we thus expect mh1 in lasrfeo@xmath1 at about @xmath102(mh1)@xmath136 , i.e. , roughly at 3 - 4ev .",
    "here , we neglect the slight increase of @xmath10 from mn to fe , but we also neglect that the 3d@xmath137 and 3d@xmath138 states relevant for the mh1 excitation both are jahn - teller active ( cf .  fig .  [ spins12]d ) ) , which reduces @xmath102(mh1 ) .",
    "moreover , these estimates neglect the effect of hybridization depicted schematically in fig .",
    "therefore , the assignment of the peak at 3.0ev to mh1 appears feasible .",
    "however , we also have to discuss alternative scenarios . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ possex ] , the lowest ct excitation @xmath97 is dipole - forbidden and expected at about 0.8ev below the lowest dipole - allowed ct excitation .",
    "firstly , the spectral weight of the peak at 3ev is too large for a dipole - forbidden excitation , and secondly , we expect only a modest anisotropy of this excitation .",
    "possibly , this dipole - forbidden excitation may explain the small but finite values of @xmath36 between 2ev and 3.5ev . in a further scenario ,",
    "the peak at 3.0ev may be interpreted as a ct exciton .",
    "note that this peak is lying at about 0.5ev below the ct absorption edge and that a truly bound state with such a large binding energy is very unlikely .",
    "again , it is not obvious why such an exciton should show a pronounced anisotropy .",
    "moreover , an exciton with such a large binding energy is expected to show a larger spectral weight and a smaller line width .    summarizing this section , we have found strong evidence that the lowest dipole - allowed absorption band in lasrfeo@xmath1 is of mh type , which is made possible by the strong splitting @xmath79 caused by the layered structure and by the fe @xmath5 - o @xmath6 hybridization .",
    "we want to add that in lasrfeo@xmath1 the energy of the lowest _ dipole - forbidden _ ct excitation may be comparable to the energy of mh1 . furthermore , the mh excitation from @xmath139 at site @xmath29 to a @xmath63 orbital on a neighboring site is lower in energy than mh1 , but the matrix element for this excitation vanishes ( cf .",
    "table i ) .",
    "we emphasize that our results do not disagree with the common interpretation that non - layered ferrites belong to the class of ct insulators .",
    "the different character can be explained by the absence of a large @xmath79 in the non - layered compounds .",
    "pisarev _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite studied the optical properties of a series of different ferrites with trivalent fe ions .",
    "many of these compounds show a shoulder in the vicinity of the onset of strong ct absorption , which has been attributed@xcite to the parity - forbidden excitation @xmath97 .",
    "the peak observed at 3.0ev in lasrfeo@xmath1 is much too strong for such a dipole - forbidden excitation .",
    "however , our results suggest that mh excitations may not be neglected for a quantitative analysis of the non - layered ferrites , they may for instance provide a better explanation for a shoulder close to the absorption edge than the dipole - forbidden excitation discussed above .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the temperature dependence of the spectral weight of mh excitations has attracted considerable interest in different transition - metal compounds because it allows to study the temperature dependence of nearest - neighbor spin - spin and orbital - orbital correlations.@xcite in lasrfeo@xmath1 we expect that the temperature dependence of these correlations is only small below 300k .",
    "actually , the spin - spin correlations change only gradually even above the ordering temperature due to the two - dimensional character.@xcite this ferrite thus may serve as a reference compound to study the role of other effects such as the thermal expansion of the lattice or bandstructure effects .",
    "as expected , the mh excitations at 3.0ev and 3.8ev show only a modest temperature dependence , see top panel of fig .",
    "[ sig1lasrfeo4 ] . according to the fit using gaussian oscillators ( cf .",
    "[ oszlasrfeo4 ] ) , the spectral weight of mh2 at 3.8ev changes only by about 10% between 5k and 250k , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fitgausexp ] . at the same time",
    ", the peak width increases by about 15% , and the peak frequency decreases by about 1% . for",
    "the peak mh1 at 3.0ev , a quantitative analysis is more challenging . both the spectral weight and the width of the gaussian oscillator depicted in fig .",
    "[ oszlasrfeo4 ] increase strongly with temperature , while the frequency of the oscillator _",
    "increases _ by about 1% from 5k to 250k .",
    "as mentioned above , there is not necessarily a one - to - one correspondence between the gaussian oscillators and the microscopic excitations with different line shapes , which is corroborated by the unexpected behavior of the oscillator parameters such as the hardening of the frequency with increasing temperature .",
    "this gives clear evidence that the change of mh1 is covered by the temperature - induced smearing of the much stronger ct excitations .",
    "to determine the temperature dependence of mh1 more reliably , we separate mh1 from the higher - lying excitations by fitting @xmath140 in the range 0.75 - 3.75ev simultaneously by an exponential function and a gaussian oscillator ( see fig .  [ fitgausexp ] ) . the former accounts for the ct band edge and its shift with temperature ,",
    "the latter describes the remaining spectral weight below the ct edge . with this procedure",
    "we find an increase of the spectral weight of mh1 of merely 15% between 15k and 250k , see inset of fig .  [ fitgausexp ] . obviously , also this value has to be taken with care , since it depends strongly on the line shape assumed for the onset of the ct absorption band .",
    "in fact , we expect the opposite trend , namely a reduction of spectral weight with increasing temperature as the @xmath120 axis lattice constant increases from 3.8709(1 )   to 3.8744(1 )   between 10k and room temperature.@xcite an increased fe - o distance should result in a reduction of the fe @xmath5 - o @xmath6 overlap which in turn should reduce the spectral weight of both mh and ct excitations .",
    "we have to conclude that an accurate determination of the temperature dependence of the spectral weight of the mh excitations is a difficult task in lasrfeo@xmath1 due to the overlap with the much stronger ct excitations .",
    "a clear separation of strong ct excitations and weaker mh excitations is an obvious prerequisite in order to reliably determine the spectral weight of the latter .",
    "however , it can safely be concluded that the thermal expansion of the lattice has only a modest impact on the spectral weight of mh excitations below room temperature .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the optical conductivity of layered lasrfeo@xmath1 for temperatures ranging from 15k to 250k in a broad frequency range from 0.5ev to 5.5ev .",
    "both the anisotropy and the different spectral weight allow us to disentangle mott - hubbard and charge - transfer excitations .",
    "we arrive at a consistent assignment of all absorption bands and find strong evidence that the lowest dipole - allowed excitation is of mott - hubbard type .",
    "remarkably , this result is in agreement with previous studies of non - layered ferrites which have been identified as charge - transfer insulators .",
    "the difference can be explained by the large splitting of the @xmath7 orbital in the layered structure , which partially compensates the large intra - atomic exchange contribution and pulls the lowest mott - hubbard excitation below the onset of charge - transfer excitations .",
