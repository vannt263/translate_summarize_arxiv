    "grand unified theories ( guts ) are among the most promising extensions of the standard model .",
    "they can explain a number of low energy phenomena , such as electric charge quantization , neutrino oscillation , and certain fermion mass relations  @xcite as well as giving unification of gauge interactions and of matter multiplets .",
    "this encourages the search for the answers to various questions in cosmology also within the gut framework  questions such as the origin of cosmological inflation and baryon asymmetry .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , one possible approach to these questions was proposed in the context of supersymmetric ( susy ) gut theory . in particular , it was noted there that in a certain class of susy models inflation is intimately associated with the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry at the gut scale , in such a way that @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the symmetry breaking scale and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 gev ) denotes the planck mass .",
    "thus , from measurements of @xmath5 , @xmath7 is estimated to be of order @xmath10 gev  @xcite , which is very close to the susy gut scale .",
    "the scalar spectral index @xmath11 in these models is very close to unity in excellent agreement with recent fits to the data  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum energy density during inflation is of order @xmath12 gev , so that the gravitational contribution to the quadrupole anisotropy is essentially negligible .",
    "furthermore , the inflaton field in this scenario eventually decays into right - handed neutrinos , whose out of equilibrium decays lead to the observed baryon asymmetry via ( non - thermal ) leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , worthwhile to realize this inflationary scenario within a grand unified framework .",
    "realistic inflationary models along this line were presented , based on the @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath1  @xcite , and @xmath0  @xcite .    in the construction of these inflationary models , which are of the  f - term inflation \" type , a global @xmath2 symmetry plays the essential role of guaranteeing the flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "indeed , @xmath2 symmetry is associated with @xmath16 susy , and so it can reside in any @xmath16 susy model .",
    "this @xmath2 symmetry is important also in `` d - term '' inflationary scenario for the same reason  @xcite . the @xmath2 symmetry",
    ", however , makes it more difficult to build susy gut models with @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and other unified groups . in @xmath1 and @xmath0 etc",
    ", at least an adjoint higgs field needs to achieve vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of order @xmath17 in order to break the symmetry to the standard model group .",
    "unfortunately , mechanisms to give vevs to adjoint higgs in susy gut models with @xmath2 symmetry usually leave scalar fields with vevs of order @xmath17 , whose potentials are flat in the susy limit . and @xmath18 which employ higgs fields in the tensor and bi - fundamental representations respectively  @xcite . ] such fields , which we shall call `` flat - directions , '' potentially correspond to moduli .",
    "moduli , here , means relatively light scalar fields developing superlarge vevs , whose presence are quite problematic in cosmology . in this paper",
    ", we shall prove that emergence of a flat - direction is not avoidable in susy @xmath0 ( and also @xmath1 ) model with @xmath2 symmetry in section 2 , and then propose a resolution in section 3 . in section 4 , we conclude .",
    "before we prove rigorously a theorem about the connection between @xmath2 symmetry , adjoint higgs vevs , and flat - direction in the context of @xmath0 , it may be helpful first to illustrate the problem with a very simple example .",
    "let us denote the adjoint ( @xmath19 ) higgs in @xmath0 by @xmath20 .",
    "a simple set of terms which would generate a vev for it would be @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "however , if there is @xmath2 symmetry , then every term in @xmath23 must have the same @xmath24 charge ( which we shall henceforth take to be 1 ) .",
    "obviously this is not possible for the terms in @xmath25 , unless we allow one of the coefficients to be replaced by a field that has @xmath26 .",
    "for example , we may consider instead @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "that means that some terms must exist to fix the vev of @xmath30 to be of order @xmath31 .",
    "one possibility would be @xmath32 .",
    "the existence of @xmath33 is necessitated by the requirement of @xmath2 invariance .",
    "we immediately see the problem : this term fixes the vev of the product @xmath34 , but leaves unfixed the relative magnitudes of @xmath30 and @xmath33 .",
    "that is , there remains a flat direction .",
    "this simple example illustrates another problem that is relevant to our later considerations . introducing the singlet field @xmath30 into @xmath35",
    "means that there is an @xmath36-term equation for @xmath30 to be satisfied . in this case",
    ", the equation @xmath37 implies that @xmath38 . since , by hypothesis @xmath39 , and by the @xmath40 condition @xmath41 , one has a contradiction . a simple way to avoid this difficulty would be to have two adjoints , one of which has vanishing vev . for example , one might consider @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath2 invariance is ensured by the choices @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the equation @xmath46 is satisfied by the vanishing of @xmath47 , while @xmath48 fixes @xmath20 .",
    "this seems to obviate the difficulty encountered before , in that we have not had to introduce the singlet @xmath30 to satisfy @xmath2 invariance .",
    "however , the two terms in @xmath49 are insuffiencient to give mass to all the fields in @xmath47 and @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , there are several color - triplet fields that remain light , and that would be disastrous for the running of the gauge couplings .",
    "all fields in the adjoints can be made heavy if an additional term is introduced : @xmath50 .",
    "note the crucial point that the singlet field @xmath30 has had to be introduced again to satisfy @xmath2 invariance .",
    "the lessons of these simple examples can in fact be generalized to a theorem , which we now state , and shall then prove : _ in @xmath0 , if the superpotential has @xmath2 symmetry , and if the adjoint higgs fields have @xmath17 vevs and contain no goldstone or pseudo - goldstone components , then there must exist fields with @xmath51 vevs that have a flat direction .",
    "_ in short , fixing the vevs of the adjoints when there is @xmath2 symmetry leads to  flat - directions \" .",
    "we shall prove the theorem first in the simplified context of @xmath0 models whose higgs sector consists of the adjoints @xmath20 and @xmath47 and some number of singlets .",
    "we shall distinguish between two kinds of fields that appear in the higgs superpotential : those that have @xmath17 vevs we shall call  higgs fields \" , while those that have vanishing vevs in the supersymmetric limit we shall call  null fields \" .",
    "the higgs fields will therefore consist of @xmath20 and some number @xmath52 of singlets that we shall denote @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the null fields will consist of @xmath47 ( possibly ) and some number @xmath55 of singlets that we shall denote @xmath56 , @xmath57 . )",
    "we shall try to fix the vevs of all these fields ( i.e. try to avoid the existence of flat directions ) , but shall find that this can not be done if the superpotential has @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "one can distinguish three kinds of terms in the higgs superpotential : type 0 terms contain no null fields ; type 1 terms are first order in null fields ; and type 2 are second order or higher in null fields .",
    "the first thing to be noted is that terms of type 2 in the superpotential make no contribution to @xmath36 terms at the minimum and thus have no effect on the minimization of the higgs potential or the vevs of the fields .",
    "therefore , in fixing the vevs we need only consider terms of type 0 and type 1 .",
    "first we shall deal with the case where @xmath23 contains no type 0 terms .",
    "if we assume that the superpotential contains no type 0 terms , it can be taken to have the form :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 represents type 2 terms that can be neglected ,    @xmath60    and    @xmath61    the @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are polynomials in the higgs fields .",
    "the factors @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) represent either singlet higgs fields ( @xmath53 ) or products of higgs fields ( @xmath53 and @xmath20 ) divided by appropriate powers of @xmath31 to make the terms dimensionally correct .",
    "we include the term @xmath66 even though it is of type 2 and does not affect the minimization , because it must be there to give mass to all the color - triplet fields in the adjoints ( as noted earlier ) , and because it shall play a crucial role in the proof by constraining the @xmath2 charges of fields .",
    "the  @xmath67 \" in eq .",
    "( 3 ) represents terms containing @xmath68 with @xmath69 larger than 3 .",
    "these can be included but would not affect the analysis .",
    "each of the three terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) must have @xmath70 and must be neutral under all local @xmath71 symmetries .",
    "consider , then , the product    @xmath72^{-1 } [ x_2]^3 [ x_3]^{-1}.\\ ] ]    this product obviously has the same charges as the following product of terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) : @xmath73^{-1 } [ x_2 { \\rm tr}(a \\ ; a_h)]^3 [ x_3 { \\rm tr}(a \\ ; a_h^3)]^{-1}$ ] . since each term in eq . ( 3 ) must have gauge charge zero and @xmath74 , it must be that @xmath75 has @xmath76 and is neutral under all local @xmath71 symmetries . moreover , since it is made up of powers of the higgs fields @xmath53 and @xmath20 , it has a vev that is @xmath77 .",
    "the crucial question will be whether such a product can exist if there are no flat directions .",
    "there are only two kinds of terms in the higgs potential available to fix the vevs of the @xmath53 and @xmath20 fields : @xmath78-terms corresponding to whatever local @xmath71 symmetries exist in the model , and @xmath36-terms corresponding to the null fields @xmath56 and @xmath47 .",
    "( it is clear from the fact that there are no type 0 terms in the higgs superpotential that @xmath79 and @xmath80 automatically vanish , since they necessarily have at least one power of a null field .",
    "that means that only the @xmath36-terms @xmath81 and @xmath48 affect the minimization . )",
    "let the gauged @xmath71 groups be denoted @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the charges of the higgs fields @xmath53 , @xmath84 , and @xmath20 under the group @xmath82 can be thought of as a vector in an @xmath85-dimensional space : @xmath86 .",
    "there are @xmath87 such vectors , one for each @xmath82 .",
    "however , it may be that not all of these vectors are independent .",
    "suppose that @xmath88 of them are independent .",
    "then the @xmath78-terms provide @xmath88 independent conditions on the vevs of the higgs fields .",
    "we can also think of the @xmath24 charges of the fields as forming an @xmath85-component vector in the same space : @xmath89 .",
    "there are @xmath90 conditions ( of the form @xmath91 ) on the vevs of @xmath53 and @xmath20 coming from @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "it is easily seen that these @xmath36-term conditions must be independent .",
    "( if some @xmath62 were expressible as linear combinations of others , that would obviously mean that there were exact relationships among some of the coefficients in the @xmath62 , which would require fine - tuning . )",
    "thus , there are a total of @xmath95 conditions on the vevs of @xmath85 fields . consequently",
    ", if all higgs field vevs are to be fixed in the supersymmetric limit , i.e. if there are to be no flat directions , it must be that @xmath96 .",
    "we will now show that this would imply that the @xmath71 charges of higgs fields are so highly constrained that no product @xmath75 of them can be constructed that has @xmath97 and @xmath98 , as needed to write down the terms in eq .",
    "consider one of the polynomials @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) . in order to satisfy the relation @xmath99",
    ", the polynomial @xmath62 must have @xmath100 terms , where @xmath101 , since each term in @xmath62 is a product of fields with non - zero vevs .",
    "then the requirement that these @xmath100 terms all have the same charge under a @xmath71 gives @xmath102 homogeneous linear relations on the charges of the higgs fields under that @xmath71 .",
    "( note that this is true also for @xmath2 . ) consequently , _ for any @xmath71 group _ , the terms in @xmath103 give _ at least _",
    "homogeneous linear relations on the charges of the higgs fields under that group .    moreover , for any @xmath71 , the requirement that the three terms displayed in eq .",
    "( 3 ) have the same charge under that group ( in particular @xmath104 for a gauge @xmath71 and @xmath105 for @xmath2 ) gives two homogeneous linear relations that must be satisfied by the charges of the fields @xmath47 , @xmath20 , and @xmath53 under that @xmath71 . eliminating the charge of the null field @xmath47 from these relations ,",
    "one is left with exactly one homogeneous linear relation on the charges of the the higgs fields under the @xmath71 .",
    "the  other terms \" in eq .",
    "( 3 ) may give additional linear relations .",
    "we thus have that the components of any  charge vector \" ( whether it be @xmath106 or @xmath107 ) must satisfy at least @xmath108 homogeneous linear relations .",
    "therefore , all the charge vectors lie in a subspace that has dimension @xmath109 . since it has already been shown that @xmath96 ( in order to fix all the vevs ) , the subspace in which all the charge vectors lie must have dimension @xmath110 .",
    "however , the number of vectors @xmath106 is @xmath88 and they are all independent , so they must span this subspace .",
    "consequently , @xmath107 , which also lies in this subspace , must be expressable as a linear combination of the @xmath106 : i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "that means that any product of powers of the higgs fields @xmath53 and @xmath20 that has vanishing charge under all the gauge groups @xmath82 must also have vanishing @xmath24 charge . however , this contradicts the requirement for writing down the terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , namely that some product @xmath75 , given in eq . ( 4 ) , has @xmath98 and @xmath97 .",
    "we have thus proven the theorem in the case where @xmath23 contains no type 0 terms .",
    "now we turn to the case where there are type 0 terms .      before doing the general case ,",
    "consider a few simple examples .",
    "let @xmath112 comprise the type 0 terms in @xmath23 , and let them all depend on only one field , a gauge - singlet higgs field that we will denote @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath112 contains only a single monomial in @xmath113 , say @xmath114 , then the condition @xmath115 will force @xmath116 to vanish , which is a contradiction since @xmath113 would then be a null field appearing in @xmath112 , which by definition contains no such fields .",
    "there must therefore be at least two different monomials in @xmath112 , e.g. @xmath117 , with @xmath118 , and @xmath119 and @xmath120 being some coefficients .",
    "however , it is then obviously impossible to make both terms in @xmath112 have @xmath70 .",
    "this illustrates the general difficulty that if there are enough terms in @xmath112 to fix the vevs of all the higgs that it contains , then there are too many constraints on the @xmath24 charges to be satisfied .",
    "to put it the other way , if the @xmath24 charges can be consistently assigned , there must be at least one vev that does not get fixed , i.e. a flat direction .",
    "a simple illustration of this is the following .",
    "let @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath24 invariance is satisfied by assigning @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , @xmath124 gives @xmath125 ; and @xmath126 gives @xmath127 .",
    "however , there is a flat direction , since the remaining condition @xmath128 gives @xmath129 , which is automatically satisfied independently of the value of @xmath130 .",
    "note that the flat direction corresponds to the @xmath24 charge assignments .",
    "( that is , only @xmath130 has a non - zero @xmath24 charge , and the flat direction is the @xmath130 direction in field space . )",
    "this result generalizes , as we now show .",
    "let @xmath112 depend on @xmath131 gauge - singlet higgs fields , which we will denote @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "let @xmath112 have the form    @xmath134    where each term @xmath135 is a monomial in the higgs fields : @xmath136 .",
    "there are @xmath131 conditions @xmath137 .",
    "it is convenient to write them in the form ( no sum over @xmath138 ) :    @xmath139    obviously the other terms in @xmath23 besides @xmath112 do not contribute to these conditions since they all contain at least one null field .",
    "the operator @xmath140 acting on any term @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) just multiplies that term by a number , @xmath141 .",
    "consequently , the equations given in eq . ( 6 ) are just homogeneous linear equations in the terms @xmath135 : @xmath142    we may assume that these @xmath131 equations are all linearly independent .",
    "for , if they were not , it would mean that some of the fields @xmath132 only appeared in @xmath112 in certain product combinations .",
    "( for example , if @xmath143 and @xmath144 only appeared in the combination @xmath145 , then the @xmath146 equation and @xmath147 equation would be proportional . )",
    "we could then take those product combinations to be new singlet fields @xmath148 .",
    "the equations that resulted from differentiating @xmath112 with respect to these new fields would be linearly independent .",
    "we can assume that we have already performed such a reduction to get eq .",
    "( 5 ) , so that the @xmath131 equations in eq . ( 6 ) are linearly independent .    now",
    ", suppose that that all the terms in @xmath112 have @xmath74 and that @xmath112 contains enough terms that there is a solution to eq .",
    "( 6 ) with all the @xmath149 .",
    "( we have already given an example of this with @xmath150 above . )",
    "let the fields have values @xmath151 at this solution .",
    "consider scaling this solution by powers of some complex number @xmath152 in the following way : @xmath153 .",
    "since each term in @xmath112 has @xmath154 , every term @xmath135 will scale by a factor of exactly @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , the equations given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) are all still satisfied , which in turn implies that the direction parametrized by @xmath152 is @xmath36-flat .",
    "( and this general result is verified in the example given above , where the scaling would affect only the field @xmath130 , which is indeed the flat direction . )    we have assumed that the fields @xmath132 are singlets . however , the same argument easily generalizes to non - singlet fields .",
    "for example , suppose we allow one of these fields to be an adjoint @xmath20 .",
    "only traces of an even power of @xmath20 can appear because the adjoint of @xmath0 is antisymmetric .",
    "we may write all the traces of powers of @xmath20 that appear in @xmath112 as combinations of @xmath155 and ratios of the form @xmath156 .",
    "now given a certain form of the vev of @xmath20 these ratios @xmath157 just give numbers .",
    "moreover , in the equation @xmath158 from eq .",
    "( 6 ) the factors of @xmath157 make no difference , since @xmath159 . )",
    "thus , we may effectively take the @xmath157 to be pure numbers and @xmath155 to be a singlet field in the argument we made before .",
    "now , all we have shown up to this point is that there is a direction that is undetermined ( i.e. flat ) by the conditions @xmath160 .",
    "that does not imply that when all the @xmath36 and @xmath78 terms are taken into account there must be a flat direction . to prove the theorem requires a few more steps .",
    "first , let us prove that there are at least @xmath131 independent terms in @xmath112 .",
    "( a set of monomials in the fields @xmath132 is independent if none of them can be expressed as a product of powers of the others . )",
    "let us suppose that of the @xmath161 terms in @xmath112 , @xmath7 are independent .",
    "then the remaining @xmath162 terms can be written in terms of the independent ones as follows : @xmath163    then eq . ( 6 ) becomes @xmath164    this is a set of @xmath131 independent linear equations in the @xmath7 quantities @xmath165 .",
    "there can be no solution unless @xmath166 , which is what we wanted to show .",
    "we are now in a position to complete the proof of the theorem .",
    "consider the case where the higgs superpotential consists of the terms given in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 5 ) , where the @xmath131 fields @xmath132 appearing in eq . ( 5 ) are a subset of the @xmath167 fields @xmath53 and @xmath20 .",
    "as was shown previously , there are @xmath168 conditions on the vevs coming from @xmath92 and @xmath169 , and @xmath88 conditions coming from the @xmath78 terms . and",
    "we have shown that there are no more than @xmath170 conditions on the vevs coming from @xmath160 ( not @xmath131 because of the direction that is left flat by those conditions ) .",
    "altogether , then , there are no more than @xmath171 conditions , and these must be sufficient to fix the vevs of the @xmath85 fields @xmath53 and @xmath20 .",
    "that implies that @xmath172 .    on the other hand",
    ", we showed that coming from the terms in @xmath103 and @xmath25 there are @xmath90 homogeneous linear relations on the charges of the higgs fields under any @xmath71 group .",
    "in addition , because there are at least @xmath131 independent terms in @xmath112 , the fact that these terms must all have the same charges ( i.e. 0 for gauge @xmath71 and 1 for @xmath2 ) , yields at least another @xmath170 homogeneous linear relations on the charges of the higgs fields under any @xmath71 . altogether , then , there are at least @xmath173 homogeneous linear relations on the charges of the @xmath85 higgs fields .",
    "that means that each  charge vector \" lies in a subspace of dimension @xmath174 .",
    "that implies that the @xmath88 independent vectors @xmath106 must span this subspace , and that therefore @xmath107 is a linear combination of the @xmath106 . as before , that means that the product @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) can not have both @xmath98 and @xmath175 as required to write the terms in eq .",
    "there is one final case to consider .",
    "suppose that the higgs superpotential consists of @xmath103 and @xmath112 , but has no terms of the form @xmath25 given in eq .",
    "( so there is no @xmath47 field . )",
    "that is , suppose the vev of @xmath20 is set by @xmath112 , @xmath103 and @xmath78 terms , rather than by @xmath25 . in that case",
    ", there are @xmath176 conditions on the @xmath85 higgs vevs , so that @xmath177 . on the other hand , the terms in @xmath103 and @xmath112 yield at least @xmath178 independent linear relations on the charges of the higgs under any @xmath71 group .",
    "thus the charge vectors lie in a subspace of dimension @xmath179 .",
    "the argument then proceeds as before .",
    "the foregoing argument applies to @xmath1 as well as @xmath0 . in @xmath1 ,",
    "one is allowed to have a cubic coupling of an adjoint higgs , so that the breaking of @xmath1 can be achieved with the terms @xmath180 , where @xmath47 and @xmath20 are in the @xmath181 .",
    "however , it is easy to show that these terms are not enough to give mass to all the un - eaten modes of the adjoints .",
    "thus , to avoid goldstone modes , one must add a term like @xmath182 , as in the @xmath0 case .",
    "the reasoning then proceeds in complete analogy with the @xmath0 case , the only ( and insignificant ) exception being that there is a cubic rather than a quartic term in @xmath25 .",
    "so far we have proven that in susy guts based on @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and other groups that require an adjoint to get a vev to break to the standard model ) @xmath2 symmetry leads to flat directions .",
    "a direction that is flat in the supersymmetric limit can lead to a  cosmological modulus problem \" .",
    "the point is that soft susy - breaking terms will give a tiny mass in the flat direction and pick out some point in that direction as the true minimum .",
    "however , in the early universe this  modulus \" field may find itself  initially \" far from the true minimum  indeed , one might typically expect that it finds itself a distance of order @xmath31 from the minimum . in that case , after susy breaking , the modulus field would oscillate about its true minimum , and the energy in these oscillations would have disastrous consequences for standard big bang cosmology .",
    "however , even if there is a flat direction , a cosmological catastrophe would be avoided if the  modulus \" field happened  initially \" to find itself at the true minimum .",
    "what we mean by the  initial \" value of the modulus field is its value after inflation .",
    "this value is determined by temperature - dependent terms in the effective potential that lift the degeneracy in the flat direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimum at low temperature is determined by the soft susy - breaking terms .",
    "the question is whether the high - temperature terms select out the same point along the flat direction as the low - energy susy - breaking terms .",
    "if so , there is no problem .",
    "let us illustrate with a toy model how the modulus might find itself at the true minimum initially .",
    "consider a superpotential of three scalar superfields @xmath183 , @xmath30 and @xmath184 of the form @xmath185 . the flat direction is given by @xmath186 .",

    "if @xmath195 is large enough , the fields @xmath30 and @xmath184 will be trapped at the origin during inflation .",
    "however , the crucial point is that both the @xmath195 term and the soft susy - breaking terms that dominate at low energy have the same  universal form \" .",
    "that means that as @xmath30 and @xmath184 evolve away from zero after inflation they will maintain the ratio @xmath189 and go directly to the true minimum . in other words , because the high-@xmath196 and low-@xmath196 mass - squared terms have the same form , the modulus finds itself  initially \" at the true minimum , thus avoiding the cosmological difficulties coming from energy trapped in oscillations about that minimum .",
    "somewhat more generally , assume the flat - direction is one dimensional line in two dimensional field space @xmath197 , as shown in fig",
    ". 0.5 cm        fig . 1 : by including susy breaking soft terms in the scalar potential , vevs of a flat - direction @xmath36 are assumed to be determined at @xmath198 ( a ) and @xmath199 ( b ) , respectively .",

    "soft terms would deform the flat - direction just by @xmath200 , which we may neglect .",
    "once the vacuum is determined , the physical mass eigenstates on that vacuum state can be found .",
    "@xmath201 and @xmath202 correspond to the mass eigenstates in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively",
    ". since @xmath203 and @xmath204 are parallel to the tangent lines @xmath205 and @xmath206 on @xmath198 and @xmath199 , their masses are @xmath207 [ zero in the susy limit ] . on the other hand , the masses of @xmath208 and @xmath209 , which are orthogonal to @xmath203 and @xmath204 respectively , should be @xmath17 .",
    "the important difference between ( a ) and ( b ) arises from the vevs of @xmath210 and @xmath211 . in case",
    "( a ) , the vevs of both @xmath208 and @xmath203 are @xmath17 , so that the oscillations of the light scalar @xmath212 would generally give rise to the cosmological modulus problem .",

    "( as the temperature falls in that example , the fields evolve from the origin directly in a straight line @xmath214 toward the true minimum , so that the field we call @xmath204 in fig .",
    "1(b ) always vanishes . )",
    "it remains to ask whether the high - temperature and low energy effective mass terms can be of minimal form .",
    "if the k@xmath215hler potential itself has a minimal form , then this can be the case .",
    "moreover , in gauge - mediated susy breaking scenario , the `` a - terms '' ( which we neglected in the above analysis ) are generally small . and even in some special cases of gravity mediation the `` a - term '' contributions to the scalar potential @xmath216 may be suppressed  @xcite .",
    "suppose that the vev of the superpotential in which @xmath217 and @xmath212 are involved ( @xmath218 ) is cancelled by another term ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "if the dimensions of @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the same , then the `` a - term '' contribution to @xmath222 with the minimal k@xmath215hler potential would effectively also cancel at the leading order .",
    "the above discussion can obviously be extended to the more general case with any number of fields .",
    "if the tangent space at a vacuum point of an n - dimensional flat - direction coincides with the tangent space at that point of the sphere whose center is at the origin , one has a situation of type ( b ) .",
    "we have proved a theorem that in models based on @xmath0 and @xmath1 the existence of a @xmath2 symmetry together with the requirement of breaking the unified group to the standard model leads to the existence of flat directions in the scalar potential in the susy limit .",
    "such light modes ( which generally obtain masses of order @xmath223 when supersymmetry breaks ) can lead to the well known ",
    "cosmological modulus problem \" .",
    "these observations are relevant to the problem of building grand unified models of inflation , where a @xmath2 symmetry is typically required to ensure the flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "we have noted in the previous section that there is a way that the cosmological modulus problem can in principle be avoided , even if there are flat directions , if the modulus modes find themselves at the true minimum of their potential after inflation . we have discussed conditions under which this may be the case .",
