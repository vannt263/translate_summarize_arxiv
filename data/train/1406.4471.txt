    "the one - dimensional hubbard hamiltonian is a paradigmatic model in condensed matter , not only for its relative simplicity , but mainly because it contains the basic ingredients to understand the physics emerging from strong interactions .",
    "moreover , its higher dimensional counterpart has been assumed for decades to be the minimal model that can explain high temperature superconductivity@xcite , and has acquired even more relevance recently in view of the current efforts to realize it in cold atomic systems@xcite .",
    "the model can be exactly solved by bethe ansatz , and its low energy physics can be understood in terms of luttinger liquid ( ll ) theory@xcite . in a luttinger liquid ,",
    "the natural excitations are collective density fluctuations , that carry either spin ( `` spinons '' ) , or charge ( `` holons '' ) .",
    "this leads to the spin - charge separation picture , in which a fermion injected into the system breaks down into excitations carrying different quantum numbers , each with a characteristic energy scale and velocity ( one for the charge , one for the spin ) .",
    "the phenomenon of spin and charge separation is an important problem in strongly correlated systems , and has intrigued physicists for decades . even though these concepts are well established , we keep finding new surprises in unexplored parameter ranges that escaped previous scrutiny .",
    "recently , a previously overlooked regime at finite temperature has come to light : the `` spin - incoherent luttinger liquid '' ( sill ) @xcite .",
    "if the spinon bandwidth is much smaller than the holon bandwidth , a small temperature relative to the fermi energy may actually be felt as a very large temperature by the spins .",
    "in fact , the charge will remain very close to the _ charge _ ground - state , but the spins will become totally incoherent , effectively at infinite temperature .",
    "this regime is characterized by universal properties in the transport , tunneling density of states , and the spectral functions @xcite .",
    "this crossover from spin - coherent to spin - incoherent is characterized by a transfer of spectral weight .",
    "remarkably , the photoemission spectrum of the sill can be understood by assuming that after the spin is thermalized , the charge becomes spinless , with a shift of the fermi momentum from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , it was also shown that a coupling to a spin bath can have a similar effect as temperature , but only in the ground - state.@xcite .",
    "clearly , this behavior defies our intuition : since the excitation spectrum of the problem is completely determined by the hamiltonian , at finite temperature ( and in the absence of phase transitions ) we only expect a redistribution of spectral weight .",
    "this paradox can be reconciled in the context of spin - charge separation . if we assume that spin and charge degrees of freedom are completely decoupled , the single - particle spectral function of the electrons can be understood as the convolution of the charge and spin dynamical correlation functions . in this paper",
    ", we use ogata and shiba s factorized wave function@xcite , complemented by tdmrg@xcite calculations at finite spin temperature , to obtain the spectral function of strongly interacting hubbard chains ( @xmath3 ) in the crossover between spin - coherent and spin - incoherent regimes .",
    "we study the one - dimensional hubbard model , which is given by the usual hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes a fermionic annihilation operator on site @xmath6 with spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the number operator , and electrons pay an on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath9 . in the following",
    ", all energies are parametrized by the hopping amplitude @xmath10 .    in order to calculate the spectral functions",
    ", we follow the formalism developed in refs .",
    ", described in great detail in ref .. we sketch the main ideas , avoiding technicalities and directing the reader to the aforementioned references . in the @xmath3 limit , using bethe ansatz , ogata and shiba demonstrated that the exact solution can be factorized and split into two parts :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 describes the charge and is comprised by spinless fermionic degrees of freedom , and @xmath13 is consistent with a `` squeezed '' chain of @xmath14 spins , where all the empty sites have been removed .",
    "@xmath12 is simply the ground - state of a one - dimensional tight - binding chain of @xmath14 non - interacting spinless fermions on a lattice with @xmath15 sites .",
    "the factorization applies also to excited states as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 labels a combination of @xmath14 wave - vectors @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , that are compatible with the total fermionic momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the index @xmath21 labels all possible configurations of momenta compatible with the total momentum of the spin wave function @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the fermionic part stays coupled to the spin part only by a phase @xmath24 introduced at the boundaries , resulting in twisted boundary conditions for the fermions , which ensures momentum conservation for the original problem .",
    "this phase is @xmath25 for the ground - state @xmath26 , and we would fill up the fermi sea by minimizing the energy with the combination of momenta @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the spinless fermions is governed by a tight - binding hamiltonian , with an energy dispersion @xmath28 , while the spin degrees of freedom are in principle non - interacting . for finite but large @xmath29",
    ", the physics of the spins can be approximated by that of a heisenberg spin chain , with @xmath30/u$ ] , where @xmath31 is the density @xcite .    in order to calculate the green s functions for the electrons , we start by noticing that destroying an electron in the original hubbard chain would translate into the annihilation of a fermion in the charge wave function , and a spin in the spin chain ( and the opposite effect for the creation operator ) .",
    "this is achieved by introducing new operators such that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a fermionic annihilation operator without spin , acting at position @xmath6 on the fermionic wave function , and @xmath34 removes a spin @xmath7 at position @xmath35 from the spin chain .",
    "the operator @xmath36 has a peculiar behavior , since it destroys the spin and the site itself , making the spin chain @xmath37 sites long .",
    "the index function @xmath35 indicates the position of the spin that belongs to site @xmath6 of the original chain , after squeezing the wave function and removing all the holes .",
    "the zero - temperature one - particle spectral function is obtained from the imaginary part of the green s function .",
    "we focus only on the contribution from the occupied levels , corresponding to the photoemission spectrum . in the lehmann representation ,",

    "we point out that the calculation of @xmath78 is not that trivial , since it involves building a string of permutations between all pairs of spins between sites @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in order to carry it out",
    ", we use a recipe similar to the one used to time - evolve the wave - function in tdmrg .",
    "since the structure of the dmrg block decimation always leaves two individual single sites in the original spin basis , we apply the permutation operator between these two sites .",
    "we propagate the wave function to the next site , and apply the next permutation .",
    "this builds a chain of permutations as the dmrg algorithm sweeps through the lattice . in order to calculate the quantum mechanical average",

    "we chose the value of @xmath87 to compare with the results from ref .. we observe identical behavior , the spectral weight shifting in momentum , with the minimum of the dispersion moving from @xmath93 at infinite spin temperature to @xmath94 at zero temperature .",
    "in addition , we notice a series of discrete flat energy levels .",
    "these energy levels correspond to the convolution of a single charge excitation with @xmath55 .",
    "the spacing between them is inversely proportional to the system size @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the bandwidth , and it is a finite size effect .",
    "this naturally explains the dmrg spectra reported in ref ..    to fully understand this effect , we look at the spectrum of a finite @xmath97 chain using exact diagonalization .",
    "we follow the reasoning sketched in ref . , which at the time was based on pure intuition , and was later proved to be the correct interpretation .",
    "it is easy to observe in fig.[fig : ed ] that one could fix a spinon momentum @xmath24 , and draw a shifted tight - binding dispersion to trace a full holon band .",
    "this principle can be used to build the full set of branches .",
    "the figure shows the distribution of spectral weights at @xmath81 .",
    "when the temperature is increased , the spectral weight of the spinons is redistributed according to the spin transfer function @xmath55 , leading to the spinless - like dispersion .",
    "we have generalized a formalism originally developed in refs . to study the crossover from the spin - coherent to sill regime in the spectral signatures of strongly correlated hubbard chains .",
    "the main idea consists of convolving the spectral functions of spinless fermions at zero temperature , and a spin chain at finite temperatures , following the bethe ansatz prescription .",
    "the finite - temperature spin correlation function can be obtained with high - accuracy using tdmrg .",
    "the theory reproduces and explains previous numerical results in a very natural way . although the spectrum is completely determined by the hamiltonian , the spectral weight of the spinons shifts to high momentum as the temperature increases .",
    "this translates into an apparent shift of the minimum of the electronic spectrum by @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , in the sill regime , the spectral function resembles that of spinless fermions at zero temperature , with a fermi momentum @xmath2 . besides a conventional thermal broadening of the line shape , one would also expect to see a broadening in momentum , due to the spread of @xmath55 .",
    "this transfer of spectral weight does not mean that the spectrum itself changes with temperature , and it is a clear departure from the non - interacting , or fermi - liquid picture . even when instruments may not be able to resolve the fine details of the spectrum , this shift and momentum broadening are a distinctive signature of spin - charge separation that should be experimentally observable .",
