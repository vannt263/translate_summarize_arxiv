    "remarkably , one can use  light - front holography \" to show that the ads / qcd theory based on the dynamics of a gravitational theory in the fifth dimension of anti de - sitter ( ads ) space has a direct mapping to qcd defined at fixed light - front time .",

    "the lf hamiltonian @xmath6 defined at fixed @xmath7 is a lorentz scalar .",
    "one can derive the lf hamiltonian directly from the qcd lagrangian using canonical methods .",
    "if one chooses light - cone gauge , the quanta of the gluon field have physical polarization @xmath8 and no ghost degrees of freedom .",
    "solving nonperturbative qcd is thus equivalent to solving the heisenberg matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "angular momentum @xmath9 is conserved at every vertex .",
    "the lf vacuum is defined as the state of lowest invariant mass and is trivial up to zero modes .",
    "there are thus no quark or gluon vacuum condensates in the lf vacuum the corresponding physics is contained within the lfwfs themselves  @xcite , thus eliminating a major contribution to the cosmological constant .",
    "the hadronic state @xmath10 is an expansion in multiparticle fock states @xmath11 , where the components @xmath12 are a column vector of states , and the basis vectors @xmath13 are the @xmath14-parton eigenstates of the free lf hamiltonian : @xmath15 etc .",
    "this fock space expansion of the hadronic eigensolutions of the lf hamiltonian provides the light - front wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) @xmath16 which define the hadron s structure in the same sense that the schrdinger wavefunction in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics describes the physics of atoms .",
    "remarkably , the lfwfs are independent of the hadron s total four momentum @xmath17 and thus of the observer s lorentz frame ; no boosts are required .",
    "the fock state expansion begins with the dominant valence state ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath18 for the nucleon ) ; higher fock states have extra gluons and @xmath19 pairs .",

    "the @xmath23 specify their spin projections in the @xmath24 direction , as in non - relativistic physics .",
    "each fock state satisfies @xmath9 conservation .",
    "hadronic observables can be computed directly from the lfwfs : structure functions and transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) are computed from the absolute squares of the lfwfs ; in fact , lfwfs are the basis of the parton model .",
    "elastic and transition form factors , decay amplitudes , and generalized parton distributions are computed from overlaps of the lfwfs .",
    "a key example of the utility of the light - front formalism is the drell - yan west formula  @xcite for the space - like form factors of electromagnetic currents given as overlaps of initial and final lfwfs .",
    "the valence and sea quark and gluon distributions which are measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering are defined from the squares of the lfwfs summed over all fock states @xmath14 .",
    "the gauge - invariant  distribution amplitudes \" @xmath25 defined from the integral over the transverse momenta @xmath26 of the valence ( smallest @xmath14 ) fock state provide a fundamental measure of the hadron at the amplitude level ;  @xcite they are the nonperturbative inputs to the factorized form of hard exclusive amplitudes and exclusive heavy hadron decays in perturbative qcd .    at high momentum where one can iterate the hard scattering kernel , one can derive dimensional counting rules  @xcite and factorization theorems .",
    "the resulting structure functions distributions obey dglap evolution equations , and the distribution amplitudes obey erbl evolution equations as a function of the maximal invariant mass , thus providing a physical factorization scheme .",
    "@xcite in each case , the derived quantities satisfy the appropriate operator product expansions , sum rules , and evolution equations . at large @xmath27 where the struck quark is far - off shell , dglap evolution",
    "is quenched ,  @xcite so that the fall - off of the dis cross sections in @xmath28 satisfies bloom - gilman inclusive - exclusive duality at fixed @xmath29    given the light - front wavefunctions @xmath30 , one can compute a large range of other hadron observables .",
    "exclusive weak transition amplitudes  @xcite such as @xmath31 , and the generalized parton distributions  @xcite measured in deeply virtual compton scattering @xmath32 are ( assuming the  handbag \" approximation ) overlap of the initial and final lfwfs with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "@xcite    the simplicity of the front form contrasts with the usual instant - form formalism .",
    "current matrix elements defined at ordinary time @xmath35 must include the coupling of the photons and vector bosons fields to connected vacuum currents ; otherwise the result is not lorentz - invariant .",
    "thus the knowledge of the hadronic eigensolutions of the instant - form hamiltonian are insufficient for determining form factors or other observables .",
    "in addition , the boost of an instant form wavefunction from @xmath36 to @xmath37 changes particle number and is an extraordinarily complicated dynamical problem .    in some cases such as the @xmath38-odd sivers single - spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ,  @xcite drell - yan lepton - pair production ,  @xcite and single - particle inclusive reactions",
    ", one must include the  lensing \" ( wilson - line ) effects of initial or final - state interactions .",
    "@xcite the ordinary rules of factorization are broken since the sign of the single spin asymmetry depends on whether one has initial - state or final - state lensing .",

    "@xcite the lfwfs of hadrons thus provide a direct connection between observables and the qcd lagrangian .",
    "they are as essential to hadron physics as dna is to biology !",
    "theories such as @xmath39 can be solved to any desired accuracy for any number of colors , flavors , and quark masses by diagonalization of the heisenberg lf matrix by employing periodic boundary conditions as in the discretized light - cone quantization method ( dlcq ) .",
    "@xcite solving qcd(3 + 1 ) using dlcq is much more challenging since the matrix diagonalization yields all hadronic eigensolutions simultaneously .",

    "@xcite we will discuss in the next section a new method where one can solve for each hadron eigenstate in terms of a single - variable lf equation analogous to the radial schrdinger equation in atomic physics .",
    "we shall also show that , remarkably , one obtains a single - variable equation of the same form with a color - confining potential using ads / qcd and lf holography .",
    "@xcite in all of these lf methods , the observer s frame is arbitrary .",

    "this matrix element requires a pion @xmath19 lf wavefunction with @xmath42 or @xmath43 , which occurs when a quark mass insertion causes a quark chiral flip . for a recent review see ref .",
    "since it is defined along the front of a light - wave , at fixed @xmath7 , the lf front - form vacuum is causal , and it is thus a match to the empty universe with zero cosmological constant . in contrast ,",
    "the instant - form vacuum describes a state of indeterminate energy at fixed time @xmath35 , a boundary condition outside the causal horizon .",
    "the qcd lf vacuum is trivial up to zero modes in the front form , thus eliminating contributions to the cosmological constant .",

    "the orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons are defined unambiguously , and there are no ghosts . * the gauge - invariant distribution amplitude @xmath47 is the integral of the valence lfwf in lcg integrated over the internal transverse momentum @xmath48 because the wilson line is trivial in this gauge .",

    "@xcite this theorem can be proven in the light - front formalism fock state by fock state .",
    "* lfwfs obey the cluster decomposition theorem , providing an elegant proof of this theorem for relativistic bound states .",
    "lf quantization provides a distinction  @xcite between static ( the square of lfwfs ) distributions versus non - universal dynamic structure functions , such as the sivers single - spin correlation and diffractive deep inelastic scattering which involve final state interactions .",
    "the origin of nuclear shadowing and process - independent anti - shadowing also becomes explicit .",
    "@xcite * lf quantization provides a simple method to implement jet hadronization at the amplitude level .",
    "@xcite * the instantaneous fermion interaction in lf quantization provides a simple derivation of the @xmath57 fixed pole contribution to deeply virtual compton scattering ,  @xcite i.e. , the @xmath58 contribution to the dvcs amplitude which is independent of photon energy and virtuality .",
    "* unlike instant time quantization , the bound state hamiltonian equation of motion in the lf is frame independent .",
    "this makes a direct connection of qcd with ads / cft methods possible .",
    "it is greatly advantageous to reduce the full multiparticle eigenvalue problem of the lf hamiltonian to an effective light - front schrdinger equation ( lfse ) which acts on the valence sector lf wavefunction and determines each eigensolution separately .",
    "@xcite in contrast , diagonalizing the lf hamiltonian yields all eigensolutions simultaneously , a complex task .",
    "the central problem for deriving the lfse becomes the derivation of the effective interaction @xmath1 which acts only on the valence sector of the theory and has , by definition , the same eigenvalue spectrum as the initial hamiltonian problem .",
    "for carrying out this program one most systematically express the higher fock components as functionals of the lower ones .",
    "the method has the advantage that the fock space is not truncated and the symmetries of the lagrangian are preserved .",
    "@xcite    for example , we can derive the lfse for a meson in terms of the invariant impact - space variable for a two - parton state @xmath59 @xmath60 thus factoring the angular dependence @xmath61 and the longitudinal , @xmath62 , and transverse mode @xmath63 . in the limit of zero quark",
    "masses the longitudinal mode decouples and the lf eigenvalue equation @xmath64 is thus a light - front wave equation for @xmath65  @xcite @xmath66 \\phi_{j , l , n}(\\zeta^2 ) = m^2 \\phi_{j , l , n}(\\zeta^2),\\ ] ] a relativistic _ single - variable _ lf schrdinger equation .    the potential in the lfse is determined from the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) @xmath67 greens function .",
    "in particular , the higher fock states in intermediate states leads to an effective interaction @xmath68 for the valence @xmath69 fock state .",
    "@xcite the potential @xmath1 thus depends on the hadronic eigenvalue @xmath70 via the lf energy denominators @xmath71 of the intermediate states which connect different lf fock states . here",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath70 is analogous to the retardation effect in qed interactions , such as the hyperfine splitting in muonium , which involves the exchange of a propagating photon .",
    "accordingly , the eigenvalues @xmath70 must be determined self - consistently .",
    "@xcite the @xmath70 dependence of the effective potential thus reflects the contributions from higher fock states in the lfse ( [ lfwe ] ) , since @xmath68 is also the kernel for the scattering amplitude @xmath73 at @xmath74 it has only `` proper '' contributions ; _ i.e. _ , it has no @xmath19 intermediate state .",
    "the potential can be constructed , in principle systematically , using lf time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , the qcd theory has the identical form as the ads theory , but with the quantum field - theoretic corrections due to the higher fock states giving a general form for the potential .",
    "this provides a novel way to solve nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the lfse for qcd becomes increasingly accurate as one includes contributions from very high particle number fock states .",
    "the above discussion assumes massless quarks .",
    "more generally we must include mass terms  @xcite @xmath75 in the kinetic energy term and allow the potential @xmath76 to have dependence on the lf momentum fraction @xmath27 .",
    "the quark masses also appear in @xmath1 due to the presence in the lf denominators as well as the chirality - violating interactions connecting the valence fock state to the higher fock states . in this case , however , the equation of motion can not be reduced to a single variable .",
    "the lfse approach also can be applied to atomic bound states in qed and nuclei . in principle",
    "one could compute the spectrum and dynamics of atoms , such as the lamb shift and hyperfine splitting of hydrogenic atoms to high precision by a systematic treatment of the potential .",
    "unlike the ordinary instant form , the resulting lfwfs are independent of the total momentum and can thus describe `` flying atoms '' without the need for dynamical boosts , such as the `` true muonium '' @xmath77 bound states which can be produced by bethe - heitler pair production @xmath78 below threshold .  @xcite a related approach for determining the valence light - front wavefunction and studying the effects of higher fock states without truncation has been given in ref .",
    "a remarkable correspondence between the equations of motion in ads and the hamiltonian equation for relativistic bound - states was found in ref .",
    "in fact , to a first semiclassical approximation , lf qcd is formally equivalent to the equations of motion on a fixed gravitational background  @xcite asymptotic to ads@xmath79 , where confinement properties are encoded in a dilaton profile @xmath80 .    a spin-@xmath81 field in ads@xmath82",
    "is represented by a rank @xmath81 tensor field @xmath83 , which is totally symmetric in all its indices . in presence of a dilaton background field",
    "@xmath80 the action is   @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the covariant derivative which includes parallel transport .",
    "the coordinates of ads are the minkowski coordinates @xmath88 and the holographic variable @xmath50 , @xmath89 .",
    "the d + 1 dimensional mass @xmath90 is not a physical observable and is _ a priory _ an arbitrary parameter . the dilaton background field @xmath80 in ( [ sj ] )",

    "one can then construct an effective action in terms of the spin modes @xmath95 with only physical degrees of freedom . in this case",
    "the system of coupled differential equations which follow from ( [ sj ] ) reduce to a homogeneous equation in terms of the physical field @xmath96 upon rescaling the ads mass @xmath90 @xmath97 \\phi(z)_j = m^2 \\phi(z)_j .\\ ] ]    upon the substitution @xmath98 and @xmath99 in ( [ adswej ] ) , we find for @xmath100 the lfse ( [ lfwe ] ) with effective potential  @xcite @xmath101 provided that the fifth dimensional mass @xmath90 is related to the internal orbital angular momentum @xmath102 and the total angular momentum @xmath103 according to @xmath104 .",

    "one also derives via light - front holography a precise relation between the bound - state amplitudes in the fifth dimension of ads space and the boost - invariant light - front wavefunctions describing the internal structure of hadrons in physical space - time .",
    "the elastic and transition form factors of the pion and the nucleons are well described in this framework .",
    "the light - front ads / qcd holographic approach thus gives a frame - independent first approximation of the color - confining dynamics , spectroscopy , and excitation spectra of relativistic light - quark bound states in qcd .",
    "this provides the basis for a profound connection between physical qcd , quantized on the light - front , and the physics of hadronic modes in a higher dimensional ads space .",
