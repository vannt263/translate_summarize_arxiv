    "a selection procedure had to be applied to the recorded data .",
    "the important electron beam and accelerator parameters , e.g. , bunch charge monitor readings , beam position monitor readings , readings of the bunch compression monitors , and read back values of rf parameters were recorded for each shot together with the readings of the mcp detector . if electron beam or accelerator parameters deviated more than the prescribed threshold , the events were excluded from the data set .",
    "we note that the number of events in the data set after the selection procedure must be sufficiently large in order to provide an acceptable statistical accuracy .",

    "fel photon spectra were recorded using the soft x - ray ( sxr ) spectrometer in the photon beamline .",
    "we note that the spectrum is simply a fourier transform of the temporal structure , and the average number of spikes ( modes ) in the time - domain should be about the same as the number of spikes in the spectral - domain .",
