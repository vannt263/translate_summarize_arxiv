    "recently the cdf collaboration reported a narrow structure @xmath0 in the decay @xmath16 followed by @xmath17 with a statistical significance of 3.8 @xmath2 .",
    "the mass and the width of this structure are fitted to be @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev respectively @xcite .",
    "since the quantum numbers of both @xmath20 and @xmath4 are @xmath21 , @xmath0 is an isospin singlet with positive @xmath22 parity .",
    "@xmath0 is very similar to the charmonium like state @xmath23 , which is observed in @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it was argued by the cdf collaboration that @xmath0 can not be a conventional charmonium state , because a @xmath25 charmonium state with mass about 4143 mev would dominantly decay into open charm pairs , and the branch ratio into the double ozi forbidden modes @xmath26 or @xmath27 is negligible .",
    "although the decay @xmath28 is unusual , the decay @xmath29 has been observed @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath0 as a conventional @xmath25 state can not be ruled out completely due to the scarcity of current experiment data . comparing with the theoretical predictions for the charmonium spectrum @xcite , we suggest that @xmath0 would most likely to be the @xmath30 state with @xmath31 , if it is a @xmath25 charmonium state",
    ". it would dominantly decay into @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in this scenario .",
    "a possible explanation for the unusual decay mode @xmath17 is that the rescattering through @xmath35 or @xmath1 may be responsible , i.e. @xmath36 . mixing between the charmonium state and the @xmath1 molecule may also contribute to this extraordinary decay .",
    "there are already some theoretical discussions about this structure .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that @xmath0 is a molecular partner of @xmath23 , and that it is a @xmath5 or @xmath8 @xmath1 molecule . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author argued that @xmath0 is a @xmath1 molecule or a exotic @xmath37 charmonium hybrid .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath0 as a @xmath13 @xmath1 molecule has been studied by qcd sum rules @xcite , however , different conclusions were reached .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 as a hadronic molecule or conventional charmonium @xmath38 were discussed as well @xcite .    in the past years , some new states near threshold have been observed , and they are usually suggested to be hadronic molecules @xcite .",
    "being different from familiar hadronic molecule candidates , @xmath0 is about 81.6 mev below the @xmath1 threshold , its binding energy is not small if it is identified as a @xmath1 molecule .",
    "there are various theoretical methods to study the hadronic molecule dynamically , such as the qcd sum rule , the qcd effective field theory @xcite , the potential models with pairwise interactions between quarks @xcite and so on .",
    "tornqvist s original work on hadronic molecule from one pion exchange is especially attractive @xcite .",
    "guided by the binding of deuteron , he performed a systematic study of possible deuteronlike two mesons bound states with long distance one pion exchange .",
    "being different from the above mentioned theoretical methods , he took into account the contribution of the tensor force .",
    "since the tensor force turns out to be very important in the deuteron binding , one expects that it would make a significant contribution to the binding of the general hadronic molecule . at short distance",
    ", the interaction should be induced by the interactions among the quarks in principle . however",
    ", a detailed and reliable modeling of the short range interaction is not an easy matter , and various phenomenological models have been proposed @xcite , although one pion exchange is expected to be dominant for the hadronic molecule .",
    "inspired by the nucleon - nucleon interactions , we further extended the one pion exchange model to represent the short distance contributions by the heavier mesons @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 exchanges in ref .",
    "@xcite . from these studies , we learn that one pion exchange really dominates the physics of hadronic molecule , and the tensor forces indeed plays a critical role in providing the binding , which results in the s - d wave mixing .",
    "since in general the molecular state is weakly bound , the separation between the two hadrons in the molecule should be large .",
    "consequently the dominance of one pion exchange can be easily understood .",
    "a remarkable success of the model is its prediction for the existence of the famous x(3872 ) long ago @xcite .",
    "based on one pion exchange , frank close et al .",
    "recently suggested that the charmed mesons molecular state is a possible solution to the enigmatic states observed above 4 gev in @xmath41 annihilation @xcite .",
    "therefore we think that the one boson exchange model can give a reasonable and reliable description for the hadronic molecule . in this work",
    ", we shall study the possible molecular states of the @xmath1 system and discuss the most favorable quantum numbers of @xmath0 as a @xmath1 molecule in the one boson exchange model .",
    "ten allowed @xmath1 states with total angular momentum smaller than 3 will be discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the effective potentials of the ten @xmath1 molecular states are given .",
    "the numerical results and the possible @xmath1 molecules are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv discusses the most favorable quantum numbers of @xmath0 and the implications , if it is interpreted as a @xmath1 molecule .",
    "finally we give our conclusions and some discussions in section v.",
    "in the one boson exchange model @xcite , the effective potentials between two hadrons are obtained by summing the interactions between light quarks or antiquarks via one boson exchange , and one boson exchange only between up quarks or down quarks has been considered .",
    "we note that the present one boson exchange is different from the well - known goldstone boson exchange constituent quark model @xcite , where one boson exchange between quarks inside a hadron is used to describe the light baryon spectrum .",
    "since strange quark is involved in the present problem , we should extend our consideration to the one boson exchange between strange quarks . because @xmath42 is an isospin singlet , the effective potential between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is induced by @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 exchanges , whereas the @xmath44 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 exchanges do nt contribute . taking into account the overall sign difference @xmath45 between the quark - quark interactions and the quark - antiquark interactions , where @xmath46 is the @xmath46-parity of the exchanged meson",
    ", we obtain the effective potential @xmath47     the interaction potentials @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 mev",
    ". the solid line represents the central potential @xmath48 , the dotted , dashed and dash - dotted lines denote @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . ]    where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively denote the effective potentials from @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 exchange between two quarks , and their expressions are given explicitly in eq.(9)-eq.(11 ) of ref .",
    "noting that the @xmath4 exchange distinguishes the @xmath1 from the exotic @xmath56 systems .",
    "the subscript @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the indexes of the strange quark and strange antiquark .",
    "@xmath59 is the well - known tensor operator , @xmath60 is the total spin of light quarks , and @xmath61 is the relative angular momentum operator . comparing with the general results in ref .",
    "@xcite , the isospin dependent interactions vanish here .",
    "we would like to note that the spin operator @xmath62 or @xmath63 only acts on the strange quark or antiquark here .",
    "the potentials @xmath48 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath51 are given as follows : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mass of the constituent strange quark , and we take @xmath68 gev in this work .",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the masses of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 mesons respectively .",
    "@xmath72(@xmath73 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 ) and @xmath74 denote the effective coupling constants between the exchanged meson and the strange quarks . in the above formulae",
    ", we have introduced form factor at each interaction vertex , and the form factor in momentum space is taken as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the so - called regularization parameter , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the mass and the four momentum of the exchanged boson respectively .",
    "the form factor suppresses the contribution of high momentum , i.e. small distance .",
    "the presence of such a form factor is dictated by the extended structure of the hadrons .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 , which governs the range of suppression , can be directly related to the hadron size which is approximately proportional to @xmath79 . however , since the question of hadron size is still very much open , the value of @xmath76 is poorly known phenomenologically , and it is dependent on the models and applications . in the nucleon - nucleon interactions ,",
    "the @xmath76 in the range of 0.8 - 1.5 gev has been used to fit the data .",
    "the extended structure of hadrons also has the following obvious consequence : because the mass of the exchanged meson determines the range of the corresponding contribution to the @xmath1 interactions , one should restrict oneself to meson exchange with the exchanged meson mass below a certain value , typically on the order of the regularization parameter @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 exchange are considered in the present work , therefore the value of @xmath76 should be at least larger than the @xmath4 meson mass .",
    "the functions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 involved in eq.([2 ] ) are given by @xmath84    .[states]the allowed states of the @xmath1 system with low spin parity , where we cut off the total angular momentum to @xmath85 . [",
    "cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results for @xmath86 state is similar to the single channel @xmath7 case .",
    "because the d wave centrifugal barrier is higher than the p wave centrifugal barrier , the total effective potential is less attractive than the @xmath7 state , this point can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ single_channel_potential ] .",
    "if the coupling constants are reduced by 20@xmath87 , bound state solution can be found only for @xmath76 larger than 1920 mev .",
    "@xmath86 @xmath1 is harder to be bound than the @xmath7 state due to the repulsive d wave centrifugal barrier .",
    "we then come to the cp exotic @xmath37 and @xmath88 states , only one channel is involved in both sectors . as has been shown in eq.([8 ] ) and eq.([9 ] ) , the potentials from one boson exchange are exactly the same , and they are less attractive than the potentials of the @xmath7 and @xmath86 states . for the @xmath37 configuration ,",
    "bound state solution appears only for @xmath76 as large as 2000 mev , and we can find a @xmath88 bound state only if the regularization parameter @xmath76 is larger than 3160 mev .",
    "if we reduce all the coupling constants by 20@xmath87 , larger value of @xmath76 is required to find bound state solutions . because the value of @xmath76 is so large that it is far beyond the range of 0.8 to 1.5 gev favored by the nucleon - nucleon interactions , we tend to conclude that the cp exotic @xmath37 and @xmath88 @xmath1 states can not be bound by the one boson exchange potential .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the fact that no such cp exotic states have been observed so far .    for the @xmath9 states , there are three configurations @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in spite of the p wave centrifugal barrier ,",
    "bound state solutions can be found for reasonable value of @xmath76 , the reason is the large attractive contributions from the tensor interaction and the spin - orbit interaction . from the numerical results in table [ 1 ] , we see that the binding energy is rather sensitive to @xmath76 , and @xmath90 is the dominant component .",
    "this is because that the 22 element of the potential in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is more attractive than the 11 element , and the @xmath91 component is strongly suppressed by the large f wave centrifugal barrier .",
    "the @xmath9 @xmath1 state is very interesting , it can be produced via the @xmath41 annihilation or with the help of the initial state radiation ( isr ) technique at @xmath92 factory .",
    "the existence of such a state can be confirmed or rejected , if more detailed @xmath41 annihilation data in the range of 4100 - 4200 mev become available .",
    "we strongly urge the babar and belle collaboration to search for this state , so that our prediction can be checked .",
    "in addition to the dominant decay modes @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the @xmath9 @xmath1 molecule can also decay into @xmath95 and @xmath35 , which are other important decay modes .    for the @xmath8 states ,",
    "there are four channels @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we note that both the tensor interaction and the spin - orbit interaction vanish in the @xmath97 configuration , and the spin - spin interaction is repulsive",
    ". however , bound state solution can be found for appropriate value of @xmath76 albeit its value is somewhat larger than the corresponding ones in the @xmath13 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 cases .",
    "this is because that the mixing of @xmath97 with @xmath96 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 under the tensor force increases the binding of the system through higher order iterative processes . from the numerical results in table [ 2++ ]",
    ", we see that the @xmath97 component is dominant , @xmath98 probability is larger than @xmath96 , and @xmath99 has the smallest probability .    finally two states @xmath100 and @xmath101 remain . for both states ,",
    "one has a two coupled channels ( p wave and f wave configurations ) . because of the p wave and f wave centrifugal barrier , bound state appears only for @xmath76 as large as 2080 mev and 1890 mev respectively . therefore both",
    "the @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath1 states may not be bound by the one boson exchange potential .    in short summary ,",
    "ten allowed @xmath1 states with low spin parity have been studied .",
    "we find that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 states are more tightly bound .",
    "we expect that the @xmath13 and @xmath6 @xmath1 molecular states very likely exist , where the system can be in s wave or d wave and the two configurations mix with each other under the tensor interaction .",
    "due to the remarkably strong contributions from the spin - spin interaction , the tensor interaction and the spin - orbit interaction , the @xmath7 @xmath1 molecule may exist in spite of p wave centrifugal barrier .",
    "the @xmath9 @xmath1 state likely exist as well , and the @xmath90 component is dominant .",
    "one expects that the one boson exchange potential could support the @xmath8 @xmath1 bound state because of the presence of the s wave configuration and mixing with the other three higher partial waves .",
    "however , the cp exotic @xmath37 and @xmath88 states , @xmath100 and @xmath101 states should not exist .",
    "since the one boson exchange potential does not support @xmath37 , @xmath88 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath1 molecular states , we concentrate on @xmath13 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath86 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 states in the following . because the @xmath102 parity of @xmath0 is positive , @xmath103 and @xmath9 states are not possible . from the numerical results in table [ 0++]-table [ 2 ] , it is obvious that the @xmath13 @xmath1 is most tightly bound by the one boson exchange potential",
    ". consequently the most favorable quantum number of @xmath0 is @xmath5 , however , @xmath10 or @xmath8 can not be excluded at present .",
    "it is crucial to perform a partial wave analysis in future , if the spatial parity turns out to be positive , @xmath5 and @xmath8 are favored , otherwise it may be a @xmath7 state .    if @xmath0 is confirmed to be a @xmath13 @xmath1 molecule with masses about 4143 mev by future experiments , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath1 molecules should be observed as well , whose masses are in the range of 4190 mev to 4210 mev . for the parameters that allow @xmath0 to emerge as a @xmath13 @xmath1 molecule",
    ", one expects that the @xmath6 and @xmath9 @xmath1 states may exist as well .",
    "we note that the @xmath102parity of both states is negative .",
    "the @xmath9 state is particularly interesting , its mass is about 4120 - 4150 mev , and it can be produced directly in the @xmath41 annihilation or via the initial state radiation at @xmath92 factory",
    ". both states can decay into @xmath35 , whereas the spin parity of the first state forbids its decay into @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath0 is observed in the @xmath26 channel , the @xmath6 and @xmath9 states should be searched for in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 final states .",
    "we suggest the cdf , babar and belle collaboration to search for this state , which would be a critical check to the @xmath1 molecule interpretation of @xmath0 .    if @xmath0 is identified to be a @xmath1 molecule , it is interesting to investigate whether a @xmath104 molecular state exists and what its most favorable quantum numbers are . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors identified @xmath23 as the @xmath104 molecular partner of @xmath0 , then its binding energy is about 77.5 mev ( belle collaboration ) or 105.9 mev ( babar collaboration ) .",
    "however , in one pion exchange model t@xmath105rnqvist demonstrated that the @xmath104 molecule should be near the threshold of 4020 mev with @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 or @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to reanalysis the @xmath104 system dynamically . in ref.@xcite , the contributions from @xmath44 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 exchanges",
    "are included , the binding energy and other static properties are found to be sensitive to the regularization parameter @xmath76 .",
    "however , we qualitatively confirmed that the @xmath106 , @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath7 @xmath104 states are more deeply bound .",
    "consequently its huge binding energy implies the existence of more @xmath104 molecules with different quantum numbers , if @xmath23 is identified as a @xmath104 bound state .",
    "however , no such candidates have been reported experimentally so far , therefore we tend to conclude that @xmath23 as a @xmath104 molecule is not favored .",
    "further experimental and theoretical efforts are needed to understand the structure and the properties of @xmath23 . with the same argument as that in the introduction section ,",
    "@xmath23 as a canonical @xmath107 charmonium can not be completely excluded . the charmonium assignment of @xmath23 can be tested by searching for @xmath108 and @xmath109 final states and by studying their angular distributions @xcite .    for the @xmath14 system",
    ", the repulsive kinetic energy is greatly reduced due to larger mass of @xmath110 meson , therefore the @xmath14 state should be more deeply bound than @xmath1 .",
    "we expect that at least @xmath13 @xmath14 molecular state should exist with larger binding energy .",
    "obviously this state could be searched for in the @xmath15 channel .",
    "because of its large mass , the most promising places to produce this state conspicuously are the large hadron colliders such as tevatron and lhc .",
    "in this work , we have dynamically studied the possible @xmath1 molecular states and the interpretation of @xmath0 as a @xmath1 molecule in the one boson exchange model , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 exchanges are taken into account .",
    "ten allowed states with low spin parity have been considered , we would like to stress that only s wave configuration is usually considered in the familiar phenomenological models such as the one boson exchange model in heavy quark effective theory @xcite and the potential model with pairwise interactions @xcite .",
    "we find that the binding energy and static properties are sensitive to the regularization parameter @xmath76 and the effective coupling constants . since the regularization parameter @xmath76 is poorly known so far , we are not able to precisely predict the binding energies of the possible @xmath1 molecular states bound by one boson exchange potential",
    ". however , we can reliably predict which ones of the ten allowed states are much easier to be bound , and the predictions are rather stable even if the uncertainty of the coupling constants is considered , as is obvious from the numerical results listed in the manuscript .",
    "further research on x(3872 ) , which is a promising @xmath111 molecule , would severely constraint the parameters of the one boson exchange model , especially the regularization parameter @xmath76 , so that the predictions presented in the work could become more precise .",
    "we quantitatively confirm that the @xmath13 @xmath1 state is most easily to be bound .",
    "our numerical results imply that the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 configurations are rather more strongly bound so that the corresponding @xmath1 molecules may exist , whereas the cp exotic @xmath37 and @xmath88 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath1 states are not be bound by the one boson exchange potential .",
    "we note that the possible existence of a number of bound state is not a specific prediction of our model @xcite .",
    "finally we would like to stress that we still can not completely rule out @xmath0 as a conventional @xmath25 charmonium at present , in spite of its peculiar decay mode @xmath26 . from the theoretical predictions for the charmonium spectrum , @xmath0 is most likely to be the @xmath30 state with @xmath31 , if it is a @xmath25 charmonium state .",
    "it unusual large branch ratio into @xmath26 may be explained by the rescattering mechanism or the mixing between charmonium and molecule .",
    "compared with other charmonium like states , the experimental information for @xmath0 is scarce , and further experiment data are critically needed .    for @xmath0 as a @xmath1 molecule , we suggest that its most favorable quantum numbers are @xmath5 , although @xmath10 and @xmath8 can not be ruled out by the present experimental data .",
    "it mainly decays into @xmath93 and @xmath94 via almost free decay of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the decay mode @xmath112 is forbidden by phase space constraints .",
    "the search for the four body decays @xmath113 and @xmath114 is crucial to test the hadronic molecule hypothesis of @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is confirmed to be a @xmath13 @xmath1 molecule by future theoretical and experimental efforts , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 partners should exist with mass in the range of 4190 - 4210 mev .",
    "we argue that the @xmath6 and @xmath9 @xmath1 states with negative @xmath102parity should be observed as well .",
    "the @xmath9 states can be produced largely in the @xmath41 annihilation or with the help the initial state radiation at @xmath92 factory , and detailed @xmath41 annihilation data near 4100@xmath1154200 mev are important to confirm or refute the existence of such state .",
    "both the @xmath6 and @xmath9 @xmath1 states can be searched for in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 final states .",
    "we strongly urge the cdf , babar and belle collaborations to search for these two negative @xmath102parity states , which would be another important test to the molecular hypothesis of @xmath0 and the reliability of our one boson exchange model .",
    "if we identify @xmath23 as a @xmath104 molecule , its large binding energy requires the existence of more @xmath104 bound states , which has not been observed so far .",
    "therefore the interpretation of @xmath23 as a @xmath104 molecule may not be favored in our opinion . with the present experiment data , the charmonium assignment for @xmath23",
    "can not be ruled out .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath13 @xmath116 molecular state should exist , and it is bound more tightly than @xmath1 .",
