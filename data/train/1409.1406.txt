    "recent analysis of fermi gamma ray space telescope data has shown an excess of gamma ray from the galactic center ( gc ) with a feature similar to annihilating dark matter @xcite ( for a review of dark matter , please see @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies @xcite also identified a similar excess of @xmath0 gev gamma rays from the region surrounding the gc . according to the analysis presented in @xcite , the fermi telescope signal of gamma ray excess in the gc can very well be fit by a @xmath1 gev dark matter particle annihilating into @xmath2 pairs with an annihilation cross section of @xmath10 , normalized to a local dark matter density of @xmath11 .",
    "the required annihilation cross section is coincidentally very close to the annihilation cross section of typical weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter candidate in order to produce the correct dark matter relic abundance observed by the planck experiment @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density parameter and @xmath14 is a parameter of order unity .",
    "several interesting particle physics models have already been proposed @xcite which explain the gc excess of gamma rays . here",
    "we study the possibility of providing such an explanation within the framework of an abelian extension of standard model , originally proposed by @xcite and later studied in the context of dark matter and ev scale sterile neutrino in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the salient feature of the model is the way it relates dark matter with neutrino mass where neutrino masses arise at one loop level with dark matter particles running inside the loops : more popularly known as `` scotogenic '' model @xcite .",
    "the additional abelian gauge symmetry @xmath4 and the corresponding gauge charges for the fields are chosen in such a way that it gives rise to a remnant @xmath7 symmetry so that the lightest @xmath7-odd particle is stable and hence can be a cold dark matter candidate . as studied in details in @xcite , this model has several dark matter candidates namely , fermion singlet , fermion triplet , scalar singlet and scalar doublet .",
    "scalar dark matter phenomenology is similar to the higgs portal models discussed extensively in the literature . in these scenarios , the scalar dark matter annihilates into the standard model ( sm ) particles through the higgs boson .",
    "co - annihilations through gauge bosons can also play a role if the cp even and cp odd components of the neutral higgs have a tiny mass difference as discussed recently in @xcite . in the context of gc gamma ray excess ,",
    "several higgs portal models have already been studied and there exists at least one neutral higgs lighter than the sm higgs which acts as a mediator between scalar dark matter and the sm particles .",
    "the mass of this light neutral higgs is approximately equal to twice the scalar dark matter mass in order to satisfy experimental bounds on relic density as well as direct detection experiments .    instead of pursuing higgs portal like scalar dark matter scenarios in the model , we study the fermionic dark matter sector . since the neutral component of fermion triplet needs to be very heavy ( @xmath15 ) in order to reproduce correct dark matter relic density @xcite",
    ", we confine our discussion to fermion singlet dark matter in this work .",
    "that is , we explore the possibility of fermion singlet dark matter in this model with mass around 30 gev which can simultaneously give rise to gc gamma ray excess as well satisfy dark matter bounds on relic density as well as direct detection cross section .",
    "such a light fermion singlet dark matter particle will self - annihilate through the abelian vector boson @xmath16 into sm particles .",
    "we also incorporate the collider constraints on such additional vector boson and its gauge couplings .",
    "we find that , although the relic density and direct detection constraints allow a significant region of the parameter space , the collider constraints reduce the parameter space into the s - wave resonance region where the gauge boson mass is approximately twice that of dark matter mass . finally , we check whether such a light fermion singlet dark matter is compatible with neutrino mass which arise at one loop level .    this letter is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we briefly discuss the model . in section [ sec : darkmatter ] , we discuss the singlet fermion dark matter as a source of gc gamma ray excess taking into account all necessary experimental constraints . in section [ neutrino ]",
    ", we discuss the compatibility of light singlet fermion dark matter with neutrino mass and finally conclude in section [ conclude ] .",
    "the model which we take as a starting point of our discussion was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "the authors in that paper discussed various possible scenarios with different combinations of majorana singlet fermions @xmath5 and majorana triplet fermions @xmath17 . here",
    "we discuss one of such models which we find the most interesting for our purposes .",
    "this , so called model c by the authors in @xcite , has the the following particle content shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".particle content of the model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     xenon100 experiment gives the lowest upper bound on spin dependent cross section as @xmath18 for a wimp mass of 45 gev at @xmath19 confidence level .",
    "here we take this conservative upper bound for both 25 gev and 35 gev dark matter analysis and draw the exclusion line . as can be seen from figure [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ]",
    ", the black solid line corresponds to this direct detection bound such that the parameter space towards the left of this line is ruled out .    to apply the collider bounds on @xmath20 and @xmath21 we follow the analysis of @xcite which studies the scenario of a new heavy abelian gauge boson coupling to dark matter as well as sm fermions in the light of collider and dark matter direct detection data . as discussed by the authors of @xcite , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) bounds on abelian vector boson",
    "coupled to sm , which is approximately @xmath22 tev , can be relaxed if @xmath16 has non - negligible couplings to dark matter .",
    "they showed that for @xmath16 decaying into sm particles with branching ratio @xmath19 and @xmath23 , the lowest allowed value of @xmath24 is approximately @xmath25 tev .",
    "this limit gets pushed up to 4 tev and @xmath26 tev , if @xmath21 is increased to @xmath27 and weak gauge coupling @xmath28 respectively . to implement these bounds",
    "we compute the branching ratio of @xmath16 decaying into dark matter particles and plot them as a function of @xmath24 in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the maximum branching ratio is around @xmath29 .",
    "we then apply three different lower limits on @xmath24 namely , 2 tev , @xmath30 tev and 3 tev and check how much of the parameter space remains .",
    "these limits can be seen in figure [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] in three different colors such that , the parameter space towards the left of that region is ruled out . it can be seen that even if we take a conservative bound @xmath31 tev , then also we have available parameter space which satisfies all other dark matter constraints .",
    "it should also be noted that near the resonance region in the @xmath32 as well as @xmath33 planes , the values of @xmath21 is much below @xmath34 for which the collider bound is @xmath35 tev as mentioned above .",
    "thus the bound @xmath24 is supposed to get further relaxed as we go below @xmath36 resulting in more and more allowed parameter space .",
    "we note that the parameter space shown in the @xmath32 plane has regions where mass of dark matter is larger than @xmath20 allowing the possibility of dark matter annihilation into two @xmath16 bosons .",
    "this particular case however , corresponds to the region towards the left side of the plot where @xmath37 gev . in our model",
    ", such annihilation of dark matter into two @xmath16 bosons can occur through t - channel exhange of the majorana fermion singlet dark matter itself .",
    "since , the allowed parameter space after incorporating all the constraints correspond to the s - wave resonance region where @xmath38 , such annihilation of dark matter into two @xmath16 bosons will not alter the allowed parameter space and hence we have not included this process in our calculations .",
    "as discussed in details in @xcite , the sm light neutrino mass can arise at one loop level in this model as can be seen in figure [ fig6 ] . at tree level only one of the neutrinos acquires non - zero mass from usual type i seesaw mechanism @xcite where the singlet fermion @xmath39 acts as the heavy right handed neutrino . writing the yukawa lagrangian for our model as @xmath40 @xmath41 the tree level light neutrino mass can be written as @xmath42 from figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ]",
    ", we see that the allowed region from dark matter as well as collider constraints suggest @xmath43 tev .",
    "since @xmath44 gev , for neutrino mass to be of ev scale , the equation ( [ neutmass ] ) suggest that the yukawa couplings @xmath45 have to be fine tuned to @xmath46 which is approximately same as the electron yukawa coupling in the sm .",
    "the other two sm neutrinos can acquire non - zero masses only when loop contributions in figure [ fig6 ] are taken into account . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the one - loop contribution @xmath47 to neutrino mass is given by @xmath48 assuming all the scalar masses in the loop diagram to be almost degenerate and written as @xmath49 then @xmath50 , \\label{scaldeg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 . for fermion singlet",
    "light dark matter , @xmath52 and hence the above expression can be approximated as @xmath53 the one - loop neutrino mass can be written as @xmath54 taking @xmath55 to be at few tev s , @xmath56 at electroweak scale and the singlet mass @xmath57 at few tens of gev ( for light fermion singlet dark matter ) , the above expression can give rise to ev scale neutrino mass if @xmath58 which can be achieved if each of the dimensionless couplings is tuned to be around @xmath59 .",
    "thus , a light fermion singlet dark matter of mass 25 gev or 35 gev is consistent with the requirement of ev scale sm neutrino masses .",
    "we have studied fermion singlet dark matter in the light of recently observed galactic center gamma ray excess within the framework of an abelian extension of standard model .",
    "the model not only gives rise to a stable dark matter candidate , but also gives rise to tiny neutrino masses both at tree level as well as one - loop level .",
    "we take two different dark matter masses @xmath60 and check whether they can give rise to the desired annihilation cross section in order to satisfy dark matter relic density constraint as well as annihilation into @xmath2 pairs to explain the galactic center gamma ray excess .",
    "we also take into account the constraints from dark matter direct detection experiments on spin dependent scattering cross section of dark matter off nuclei .",
    "since the annihilation and scattering of light fermion singlet dark matter is mediated by the abelian vector boson @xmath16 , these scenarios can also be constrained from lhc limits on additional gauge boson mass @xmath20 and its coupling @xmath21 . without performing a detailed calculation for collider signatures",
    ", we use the results from @xcite where the authors found the lower bound on @xmath24 to be @xmath25 tev for @xmath61 and @xmath23 . in the present work ,",
    "we find the maximum branching ratio of @xmath16 boson into sm particles to be approximately @xmath19 .",
    "we find that , even after applying a conservative lower limit on @xmath24 as @xmath62 tev , we still have parameter space which can satisfy all dark matter constraints .",
    "the allowed parameter space is essentially an s - wave resonance region where mass of the @xmath16 boson is twice that of dark matter mass . since the allowed region of parameter space is limited , these scenarios can be further constrained or even ruled out by future data from dark matter direct detection as well as collider experiments .",
