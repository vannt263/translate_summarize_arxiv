    "joint power and admission control ( jpac ) has been recognized as an effective tool for interference management in cellular , ad hoc , and cognitive underlay wireless networks for two decades @xcite .",
    "the goal of jpac is to support a maximum number of links at their specified signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) targets while using a minimum total transmission power when all links in the interference - limited network can not be simultaneously supported .",
    "jpac can not only determine which interfering links must be turned off and rescheduled along orthogonal resource dimensions ( such as time , space , or frequency slots ) , but also alleviate the difficulties of the convergence of stand - alone power control algorithms .",
    "for example , a longstanding issue associated with the foschini - miljanic algorithm @xcite is that , it does not converge when the preselected sinr levels are infeasible . in this case",
    ", a jpac approach must be adopted to determine which links to be removed .",
    "the jpac problem can be solved to global optimality by checking the simultaneous supportability of every subset of links .",
    "however , the computational complexity of this enumeration approach grows exponentially with the total number of links .",
    "theoretically , the problem is known to be np - hard to solve ( to global optimality ) and to approximate ( to constant ratio global optimality ) @xcite , so various heuristics algorithms @xcite have been proposed .",
    "in particular , the reference  @xcite proposed a convex approximation - based algorithm , called linear programming deflation ( lpd ) algorithm . instead of solving the original np - hard problem directly , the lpd algorithm solves an appropriate lp approximation of the original problem at each iteration and use its solution to guide the removal of interfering links .",
    "the removal procedure is terminated until all the remaining links in the network are simultaneously supportable .",
    "the reference  @xcite developed another lp relaxation - based new linear programming deflation ( nlpd ) algorithm for the jpac problem . in @xcite , the jpac problem is first equivalently reformulated as a sparse @xmath0-minimization problem and then its @xmath1-convex relaxation is used to derive a lp , which is different from the one in @xcite .",
    "again , the solution to the derived lp can guide an iterative link removal procedure , and the removal procedure is terminated if all the remaining links in the network are simultaneously supportable .",
    "similar ideas were also used in @xcite to solve the joint beamforming and admission control problem for the cellular downlink network .    the joint power / beamforming and admission control problem in the above - mentioned references except @xcite assumes perfect channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "however , such an assumption generally does not hold in practice@xcite . in @xcite , the authors considered the worst - case robust jpac problem with bounded channel estimation errors .",
    "the key in @xcite is that the relaxed lp with bounded uncertainty can be equivalently rewritten as a second - order cone program ( socp ) .",
    "the overall approximation algorithm remains similar to lpd for the case of perfect csi , except that the socp formulation is used to carry out power control and its solution is used to check whether links are simultaneously supportable in the worst case .    in this paper , we consider the chance ( probabilistic or outage - based ) sinr constrained jpac problem , where a random channel model is used and each link s sinr outage probability must be kept below a given tolerance .",
    "unfortunately , this kind of optimization problems turn out to be extremely difficult to solve in an _ exact _ fashion , since chance sinr constraints are computationally intractable even though channel distribution information ( cdi ) is assumed .",
    "thanks to recent advances in chance constrained optimization@xcite , the chance sinr constraint can be approximated via sampling with provable performance guarantee .",
    "the sample ( scenario ) approximation typically does not require explicit cdi .",
    "instead , it only requires that the random channel parameters can be sampled .",
    "therefore , the sample approximation technique is distributionally robust . as remarked in @xcite",
    ", most wireless systems are constantly sampling channel fading processes as part of the operation for coherent detection and adaptive modulation .",
    "hence , the above sampling requirement can be easily satisfied .",
    "we further show that the sample approximation of the chance sinr constrained jpac problem can be equivalently reformulated as a group sparse @xmath0-minimization problem , which is a nontrivial extension of the sparse formulation in @xcite .",
    "then , we consider its @xmath1-relaxation , which is an socp ( different from the one in @xcite ) , and use the solution of the socp relaxation problem to check the simultaneous supportability of all links in the network and guide an iterative link removal procedure ( deflation ) . instead of relying on standard socp solvers to solve the derived socp",
    ", we exploit its special structure and custom - design an efficient algorithm .",
    "moreover , we develop an easily checkable necessary condition for all links in the network to be simultaneously supported at their desired sinr requirements . this condition allows us to iteratively remove strong interfering links and therefore significantly accelerate the deflation process .",
    "numerical results show that the proposed sample approximation - based deflation approaches perform very well . _",

    "lowercase boldface and uppercase boldface are used for vectors and matrices , respectively . for",
    "a given vector @xmath4 the notations @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for its maximum entry , its minimum entry , its @xmath9-th entry , and the indicator function of @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 otherwise ) , respectively",

    "the algorithms developed for the chance sinr constrained jpac problem in this work are based on the nlpd algorithm @xcite for the jpac problem that assumes perfect csi . to streamline the presentation",
    ", we briefly review the nlpd algorithm in this section .",
    "the basic idea of the nlpd algorithm is to update the power and check whether all links can be supported or not .",
    "if the answer is yes , then terminate the algorithm ; else drop one link from the network and update the power again .",
    "the above process is repeated until all the remaining links can be simultaneously supported .",
    "specifically , consider a @xmath31-link ( a link corresponds to a transmitter - receiver pair ) interference channel with channel gains @xmath32 ( from transmitter @xmath33 to receiver @xmath9 ) , noise power @xmath34 sinr target @xmath35 and power budget @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "denote the power allocation vector by @xmath38 and the power budget vector by @xmath39 . treating interference as noise ,",
    "we can write the sinr at the @xmath9-th receiver as @xmath40 correspondingly , we introduce an equivalent normalized channel . in particular , we use @xmath41 with @xmath42  to denote the normalized power allocation vector , and use @xmath43 with @xmath44  to denote the normalized noise vector .",
    "we denote the normalized channel matrix by @xmath45 with the @xmath46-th entry @xmath47 with these notations , it is simple to check that @xmath48    based on the balancing lemma@xcite , we reformulate the joint power and admission control problem as a sparse optimization problem @xmath49 where @xmath50 in the above , @xmath28 is the all - one vector of length @xmath31 . since problem is np - hard , we further consider its @xmath1-convex relaxation ( which is equivalent to an lp ) @xmath51 by solving , we know whether all links in the network can be simultaneously supported or not .",
    "if not , we drop one link ( mathematically , delete the corresponding row and column of @xmath21 and the corresponding entry of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) from the network according to some removal strategy , and solve a reduced problem until all the remaining links are supported .",
    "consider the chance sinr constrained jpac problem , where the channel gains @xmath54 and the noise power @xmath55 in the sinr expression are now random variables .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath55 in are random variables , we need to redefine the concept that a link is supported .",
    "we call link @xmath9 is supported if its outage probability is below a specified tolerance @xmath56 i.e. , @xmath57 where the probability is taken with respect to the random variables @xmath54 and @xmath58 the chance sinr constrained jpac problem can be formulated as a two - stage optimization problem . specifically , the first stage maximizes the number of admitted links : @xmath59 \\mbox{s.t . } & \\displaystyle { \\mathbb{p}}\\left({{\\mbox{sinr}}}_k({\\mathbf{p}})\\geq \\gamma_k\\right)\\geq 1-\\epsilon,~k\\in\\cal s\\subseteq\\cal k,\\\\ & \\bm{0 } \\leq { \\mathbf{p}}\\leq \\bar{\\mathbf{p}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] we use @xmath60 to denote the optimal solution for problem and call it _ maximum admissible set_. notice that the solution for might not be unique . the second stage minimizes the total transmission power required to support the admitted links : @xmath61 due to the choice of @xmath62 power control problem is feasible .",
    "in general , the chance sinr constrained optimization problem and problem are difficult to solve exactly , since it is difficult to obtain the closed - form expression of ( even though cdi is known ) . in this section ,",
    "we first approximate the computationally intractable chance sinr constraints via sampling , and then reformulate the sample approximation of problems and a group sparse optimization problem .",
    "three distinctive advantages of the sample approximation scheme are as follows .",
    "first , it does not require explicit cdi , but only needs samples of channel realizations , which are already available as part of the operation of current wireless systems .",
    "second , the sample approximation technique significantly simplifies problems and by replacing the difficult chance sinr constraint with finitely many simple linear constraints .",
    "last but not the least , solving the sample approximation problem returns a solution to the original chance constrained problem with guaranteed performance@xcite .",
    "we handle the chance sinr constraint via sample approximations@xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath63 are @xmath64 independent samples drawn according to the distribution of @xmath65 , we use @xmath66 to approximate the chance sinr constraint .",
    "intuitively , if the sample size @xmath64 is sufficiently large , then the power allocation vector @xmath67 satisfying will satisfy the chance sinr constraint with high probability . as shown in @xcite , we have the following theorem .",
    "[ lemma - samp]if @xmath68 for any @xmath69 then the solution to problem @xmath70 will satisfy each of the chance sinr constraint with probability at least @xmath71    theorem [ lemma - samp ] shows that it makes sense to call link @xmath9 is supported if _ all sampled sinr constraints _ in are satisfied .",
    "in fact , the above sample approximation technique admits the following explanation .",
    "assume that the channel gains @xmath54 and the noise power @xmath55 are random variables ( but their distribution is unknown ) .",
    "we observe the channel and noise realizations of all links at time slots @xmath72 and design a power allocation strategy ( i.e. , support some links with appropriate power allocation and remove the others ) based on the observed channel and noise realizations at these time slots .",
    "then this observe - and - design power allocation strategy can be used at the following time slots , and it is capable of satisfying the supported links chance sinr requirements with high probability if the number of observed time slots is large .",
    "the equation reveals how the probability parameter @xmath73 and the number of observed time slots @xmath64 are related to each other .",
    "we remark that if problem is feasible , it has the following property .",

    "then we can appropriately decrease @xmath80 and strictly decrease the objective function of problem without violating the other links sampled sinr constraints .",

    "total transmission power as a result of the second term in the objective of .",
    "we conclude the above results in theorem [ thm1 ] and relegate its proof to appendix [ app - formulation ] .",

    "the formulation also has the following property stated in proposition [ mingti1 ] , which is mainly due to the special structure of @xmath106 the proof of proposition [ mingti1 ] can be found in appendix [ app - proposition ] .",
    "[ mingti1]suppose that @xmath96 is the solution to problem and link @xmath9 is supported at the point @xmath96 ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) .",

    "in fact , we know from proposition [ mingti1 ] that when @xmath109 , the solution of problem satisfies @xmath110 ( i.e. , @xmath111 for supported links and @xmath112 for unsupported links ) , and problem reduces to problem . since problem is strongly np - hard to solve to global optimality and strongly np - hard to approximate to constant factor global optimality@xcite , it follows that problem is also strongly np - hard to solve and approximate .    a main difference between problem and problem is as follows . in problem , if link @xmath9 is supported , then @xmath113 in this case is a scalar and equals zero ; while in problem , if link @xmath9 is supported , @xmath113 is not necessarily equal to zero .",

    "we give the subdifferential @xcite of the function @xmath122 in proposition [ subgradient2 ] , which plays an important role in the following analysis and algorithm design .",

    "we now discuss the choice of the parameter @xmath138 in .",
    "the parameter @xmath138 in should be chosen appropriately such that the following `` never - over - removal '' property is satisfied : the solution of problem should simultaneously support all links at their desired sinr targets with minimum total transmission power as long as all links in the network are simultaneously supportable .",

    "[ time1 ] shows that the pabb - d algorithm substantially outperforms the socp - d algorithm in terms of the average cpu time .",
    "this is not surprising , since in each power control step ( i.e. , solving problem ) , the custom - design algorithm is used to carry out power control in the pabb - d algorithm while a general - purpose solver cvx is used to update power in the socp - d algorithm .",
