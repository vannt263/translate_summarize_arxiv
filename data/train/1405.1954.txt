    "in 2010 , antihydrogen atoms were trapped at cern @xcite . since then , cern s alpha collaboration has reported initial experimental results on the two most commonly discussed symmetry tests with antihydrogen : spectral tests of cpt @xcite ; and gravity freefall tests of the weak equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "future experiments are expected to obtain much more precise results @xcite .    a less commonly discussed test of fundamental symmetries concerns the electric charge of antihydrogen .",
    "assuming that atomic hydrogen ( h ) is itself charge neutral , cpt demands that antihydrogen also be charge neutral .",
    "while there do not appear to be extraordinarily precise measurements on h itself , other normal - matter atoms and molecules are known to be neutral to remarkable precision @xcite : to about @xmath0 for diverse species such as he , h@xmath1 , and sf@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the elementary charge .",
    "the methods used in these studies are unsuitable for antihydrogen as they require macroscopic quantities of atoms or molecules ; to date , only about @xmath4 antihydrogen atoms have been trapped and detected , and there are no prospects for trapping macroscopic quantities .",
    "charge neutrality of antimatter atoms , as well as of matter atoms , is also expected from the condition for quantum anomaly cancellation , which is required for theoretical consistency in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "alpha recently reported @xcite a bound on the antihydrogen charge @xmath5 of @xmath6 , where the first error arises from counting statistics , and the second error is estimated based on systematic effects .",
    "this bound was based on a search for the deflection of putatively charged antihydrogen atoms by an applied electric field . here",
    "we describe a different technique , related to stochastic acceleration @xcite , to measure the charge .",
    "this technique uses randomly time - varying electric fields to eject putatively charged antihydrogen atoms from an alpha - style trap .",
    "current measurements using this technique @xcite set a bound on @xmath7 of about @xmath8 , an order of magnitude looser than that found by the deflection technique , but this stochastic acceleration technique can easily be extended to much better precision , perhaps ultimately reaching @xmath9 .",
    "alpha traps antihydrogen atoms by producing and capturing them in a minimum - b trap @xcite .",
    "the trap confines those anti - atoms whose magnetic moment @xmath10 is aligned such that they are attracted to the minimum of the trap magnetic field @xmath11 , and whose kinetic energy is below the trap well depth , @xmath12 . in alpha ( see fig .  [ fig1schematicfields]a ) , this magnetic minimum is created by an octupole magnet which produces transverse fields of magnitude @xmath13 t at the trap wall ( @xmath14 mm ) , and two mirror coils which produce axial fields of @xmath15 t at their centers .",
    "the mirror coil centers are symmetrically located at distances @xmath16 mm from the trap center at @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1schematicfields]b ) .",
    "these fields are superimposed on a uniform axial field of 1 t produced by an external solenoid @xcite ; taken together , they create a trap of depth @xmath18mk @xcite .     as a function of @xmath19 .",

    "the escaping anti - atoms were then detected with about @xmath26% efficiency @xcite when they annihilated on the trap wall .",
    "in the previously reported deflection experiments @xcite , the anti - atoms were subjected to electric fields similar to those derived from the potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1schematicfields]c .",
    "together with the magnetic field , these electric fields form a well in which the on - axis potential energy of an anti - atom with a putative charge @xmath5 is given by @xmath27 where all energies are specified in units of kelvins , @xmath28k / t is the normalized antihydrogen magnetic moment @xcite , @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant , and where we approximate the electric field inside the trap by a constant value @xmath30 .",
    "as @xmath31 has a minimum at @xmath17 , this well also has a minimum at @xmath17 when @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , the annihilations that result from the last - phase magnet shutoff will be centered around @xmath17 . if @xmath33 , then the well minimum will shift @xcite by an amount @xmath34 where we approximate the magnetic field around the minimum as @xmath35 . to set the deflection - based @xmath7 bound quoted above @xcite ,",

    "( [ deflectionscaling ] ) suggests three methods of tightening the bounds on @xmath7 : ( i ) increasing @xmath30 .",

    "( ii ) decreasing @xmath37 .",
    "the increase in @xmath31 going from the trap center to the trap axial ends , which is proportional to @xmath37 , sets the trap depth .",
    "currently , the trap depth of @xmath18mk can not be lowered without anti - atoms escaping because many of the anti - atoms are only shallowly trapped @xcite .",
    "laser cooling of the trapped anti - atoms @xcite has the potential to lower the anti - atom temperature to about @xmath38mk , which would allow us to lower the post - cooling trap well depth to perhaps @xmath39mk without losing too many anti - atoms ; @xmath37 would decrease correspondingly .",
    "( iii ) obtaining a better experimental determination of the measured @xmath36 .",
    "the error in @xmath36 is set by counting statistics .",
    "alpha utilized a sample of @xmath40 anti - atoms collected over two years for its determination @xcite of @xmath7 .",
    "as the statistical error scales as the inverse square root of the number of samples , it would be difficult to decrease this error without significantly increasing the trapping rate .",
    "taken together , these improvements have the potential to tighten the bound on @xmath7 by less than a factor of one hundred .",
    "consequently , it is worth investigating other methods to determine @xmath7 .",
    "the electric fields @xmath30 effectively remove any inadvertently mirror - trapped antiprotons from the system ( cf .  table  1 of ref .  )",
    ". however , other particles , such as putatively charged antihydrogen atoms , can also be ejected , and at a charge much less than the unit charge . for the potential in the fig .",
    "[ fig1schematicfields]c , the wells predicted by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) will cease to exist for any anti - atom with a @xmath41 .",
    "further , anti - atoms with a charge below that required for the well to disappear , i.e. @xmath42 , will still be accelerated by the application of the electric fields .",
    "they can be ejected if the extra increment of energy they gain is sufficient for them to climb over the trap walls .    in the previously reported experiment @xcite ,",
    "the fields were not static ; they cycled between potentials similar to the two shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1schematicfields]c .",
    "altogether , the fields underwent nine transitions .",
    "( the first four transitions used half - strength fields ) .",
    "the transition timescales ( @xmath43ms ) were short compared to the anti - atom orbit timescales ( typically @xmath44ms ) , and the orbit timescales were comparable to the time intervals between transitions ( @xmath45ms ) .",
    "thus , the accelerations at each transition were non - adiabatic , and , at each transition , the anti - atoms received a kinetic energy `` kick . ''",
    "these kicks were effectively random ; an individual kick might have increased or decreased the anti - atom s energy . depending on @xmath7 and the vagaries of the stochastic process",
    ", the kicks might give the anti - atoms enough energy to escape the well .",
    "this process is illustrated by the simulation results in fig .",
    "[ ejectionsim ] .",
    "large numbers of anti - atoms were ejected for large @xmath7 , small numbers for small @xmath7 , and very few anti - atoms were lost when @xmath32 . as approximately half of the simulated anti - atoms were lost at @xmath46 , but experimentally alpha observed trapped anti - atoms at the end of these cycles , alpha set an experimental limit in the neighborhood of @xmath47 for the anti - atom charge @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of an absolute trapping rate measurement makes setting a precise limit impossible for this current dataset using this methodology .",
    "we propose @xcite to remedy this problem , and make an improved determination of @xmath7 , by measuring the trapping rate with and without the application of stochastic electric fields .",
    "specifically , we would measure the number of anti - atoms remaining in the trap ( by turning off the trapping magnetic fields ) per trapping attempt , or trial , after a set of acceleration cycles were applied for a time @xmath48 , or else after the trap was kept quiescent ( no accelerating fields ) for the same time @xmath48 . by ensuring that both types of trials hold the anti - atoms for equal times",
    ", we would take into account any effects from vacuum annihilation or other anti - atom loss mechanisms . to ameliorate the effects of long time drifts",
    ", we would alternate the two types of trials .",
    "if we were to observe that the acceleration - on rate was lower than the acceleration - off rate , we could use analytic or numerical means to estimate the @xmath7 that would cause the observed difference . if , as is more likely",
    ", we observe no statistically significant difference between these rates , we could use these same means to calculate the @xmath7 that would have caused a measurable difference ; a good criterion would be to find the critical @xmath7 which would cause half the anti - atoms to be lost . in either case , this stochastic acceleration methodology would place a value or bound on @xmath7 .     versus annihilation time for different values of @xmath7 : ( a ) @xmath46 , ( b ) @xmath49 , and ( c ) @xmath32 .",
    "each dot represents one annihilation .",
    "the colored vertical lines indicate the start time for different manipulations : the half - strength clearing cycles begin at the leftmost green line , the full - strength clearings cycles begin at the middle blue line , and the final @xmath30 field ( used in the deflection measurement ) is applied at the magenta rightmost line .",
    "the multiple clumps in ( a ) and ( b ) reflect multiple oscillations of the anti - atoms in the potential well of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the very small losses in ( c ) are due to the gradual depopulation of the quasi - trapped states @xcite . in ( a )",
    ", 54% of the charge is lost from @xmath50 to the end of the plot ; in ( b ) , 2.4% of the charge is lost ; in ( c ) , 0.3% of the charge is lost.,width=321 ]      let us take @xmath51 to be the typical electrical potential change experienced by an anti - atom during one kick .",
    "such a potential change would result in a center - of - mass kinetic energy change of @xmath52 for an anti - atom with a charge @xmath7",
    ". following the classic random walk scaling , the typical total energy gained after @xmath53 kicks would be on the order of @xmath54 .",
    "if this energy exceeds the trap depth @xmath55 , a condition approximately met if @xmath56 then the kicks will drive a typical anti - atom of charge @xmath7 out of the trap .",
    "this stochastic acceleration methodology has several advantages over the deflection methodology employed in refs .   and could ultimately lead to a much better bound .",
    "first , instead of searching for a small average deflection , which requires hundreds of anti - atoms , the stochastic acceleration methodology relies on the simpler observation that anti - atoms have survived the acceleration cycles ; thus , the test can reach statistical significance with only a few tens of anti - atoms .",
    "second , the deflection methodology requires that the electric field everywhere point in the same direction over the entire length of the trap .",
    "the stochastic acceleration methodology has no such requirement , and the potential can be inverted over a short distance , resulting in much larger electric fields .",
    "for instance , if the potential oscillated between that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1schematicfields]d , and its inverse , the average change in the field would be approximately @xmath57 , a 20-fold increase over the fields obtained from the potential in fig .",
    "[ fig1schematicfields]c .",
    "third , and most important , we can improve the sensitivity of the measurement by taking advantage of the @xmath58 scaling of eq .",
    "( [ stochasticlimit ] ) on the number of acceleration cycles .",
    "as anti - atoms can be held for a very long time @xcite , @xmath53 can be very large .",
    "we note , however , that this methodology does not yield the sign of any observed putative charge .      while we can analytically estimate the critical @xmath7 from eq .",
    "[ stochasticlimit ] , our estimate would rely on a parameter , @xmath59 , which can only be approximated analytically . furthermore , the random walk in energy - space model on which eq .",
    "[ stochasticlimit ] is based has faults , most obviously that it would allow energies to become negative",
    ". thus , we use numeric simulations to obtain a more precise estimate of the critical @xmath7 .",

    "[ stochasticscaling ] , we find numerically that @xmath7 and @xmath73 scale as @xmath84 .",
    "this differs slightly from the diffusive prediction of eq .",
    "[ stochasticlimit ] , which suggests @xmath85 .",
    "part of the difference between these two scaling relations stems from the hard upper energy cutoff assumed in eq .",
    "[ stochasticlimit ] ; in the analytic calculation , anti - atoms are assumed to annihilate immediately on reaching the magnetic well depth @xmath55 .",
    "the simulations , however , show that there exist quasi - stable orbits with total energy greater than @xmath55 .",
    "anti - atoms on these orbits will remain trapped for some time @xcite .",
    "evidence for these `` quasitrapped '' anti - atoms can be seen in fig .",
    "[ simulation]b , which shows that the final energies of many simulated anti - atoms are well above the trap depth of @xmath77mk . if the simulations are prematurely halted when the anti - atoms energies exceed @xmath55 rather than when they annihilate on the trap wall , the simulation scaling changes to @xmath86 , significantly closer to the analytic prediction @xcite .",
    "the remaining difference may be due to the lack of a zero bound in the analytic calculation , and the existence of quasi - periodic orbits in the simulation .      since our stochastic acceleration scales with the square root of the number of acceleration cycles , it is not as efficient as resonant or autoresonant ( swept frequency ) acceleration @xcite",
    ". unfortunately we can not use either of the latter approaches .",
    "resonant acceleration , i.e.  simply driving the anti - atoms with an electric field that oscillates at their predicted bounce frequency , requires that a single frequency be resonant with all anti - atoms . while the anti - atoms do undergo an approximately sinusoidal oscillation in @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "c1a in ref .  ) , the frequency of this oscillation is not unique .",
    "numerical simulations show that the oscillation frequency increases with energy ; the system is `` stiff . ''",
    "this would appear to make the system a candidate for an autoresonant drive . however , autoresonance is best at capturing and exciting initially stationary particles @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the anti - atoms are already excited and few would be captured . moreover , because of exchanges between parallel and perpendicular energy , the axial oscillation frequency exhibits drifts and shifts ( see fig .  [ axialfreq ] for examples in an undriven system ) .",
    "any anti - atoms that had been captured in a trapping bucket would quickly escape .",
    "while we have made no formal study , the longitudinal motion generally appears to be chaotic in the long term .",
    "stochastic acceleration is essentially a random walk process , and thus requires an element of randomness in the relation between the drive frequency and oscillation frequency . in many cases ,",
    "the already - present axial frequency shifts are sufficient",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ axialfreq ] shows that there can be long lasting periods of frequency stability , particularly for low energy anti - atoms , and the anti - atoms may not heat during these periods . to introduce additional randomness into the system , we modulate @xmath87 by a random function with uniform distribution and standard deviation @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ sigma - escape ] plots the relation between @xmath73 , the median escape time and @xmath88 .",
    "it shows that while stochastic acceleration occurs even in the absence of this modulation , the escape time @xmath87 decreases as the modulation @xmath88 increases , reaching a plateau once @xmath88 is approximately 20% of the switching time @xmath87 .",
    "note that once randomization is introduced in the switching times , it is not necessary to randomize the voltage levels between which the electrode potentials switch . on average , doing so only reduces @xmath89 , thereby decreasing the energy kicks that the anti - atoms receive , and reducing the acceleration .     as a function of normalized drive randomization time @xmath90 , for @xmath91 , @xmath66v , @xmath67ms.,width=316 ]      to obtain",
    "the shortest mean escape times , the switching time @xmath87 must be optimized to obtain the best bound on @xmath7 . in an experiment running for a fixed total time @xmath48 , the number of inversions @xmath53 is inversely proportional to @xmath87 , thus suggesting a short @xmath87 .",
    "however , if @xmath87 is too short , anti - atoms will not have time to respond to the electric field before the electric field is inverted , and the size of the energy kick for each inversion will diminish .",
    "the optimal switching time is expected to be comparable to the time it takes an anti - atom to traverse the distance between two oppositely biased electrodes . for an anti - atom trapped near the top of a @xmath77mk well and for the standard electrode configuration , this time is about @xmath92ms . note that this timescale is much shorter than the orbital periods predicted by fig .",
    "[ axialfreq ] , as here the anti - atoms need only transverse the distance between field reversals , typically between adjacent electrodes , not the entire trap .",
    "( in the experiments to date , discussed in the introduction , the fields did extend across the entire trap , and the relevant time scale was the orbital bounce period . )    this optimal time is confirmed in fig .",

    "this is unavoidable , but unfortunate because it decreases the number @xmath53 of kicks that fit into a fixed acceleration time @xmath48 .",
    "however , the benefits from the lower trapping potential outweigh the disadvantages of the decreased number of kicks , and cooling is , on net , beneficial ( see fig .",
    "[ stochasticscaling ] ) .",
    "fortunately , for a particular configuration , one does not have to hit the optimum exactly . for @xmath77mk and the standard electrode configuration , for example ,",

    "in earlier work , alpha established @xcite that antihydrogen can be trapped for at least @xmath25s ; with expected improvements to the vacuum , it is not unreasonable to assume that anti - atoms could be trapped for @xmath100s .",
    "this would allow time for @xmath101 acceleration cycles ; simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ stochasticscaling ] ) then suggest that we could bound @xmath102 to @xmath103 . with",
    "laser cooled anti - atoms at @xmath38mk @xcite we could reduce the trapping potential to perhaps @xmath78mk , while still retaining most of the anti - atoms , and the bound would drop to @xmath104 .",
    "adiabatic expansion cooling of the anti - atoms might reduce their temperature by a further factor of ten , yielding a bound around @xmath105 .",
    "this bound approaches the limit where antihydrogen polarization effects , studied in ref .  , need to be taken into account .",
    "other systematic effects are likely to be small , as the relevant experimental parameters ( the applied electric potentials and magnetic fields ) are well controlled , and , from eq .",
    "( [ stochasticlimit ] ) , expected to enter into the result only linearly .",
    "we note that the conducting tubes in which an anti - atom gravity experiment would take place would exhibit anomalous `` patch '' electric fields @xcite , and this could cause a a significant systematic error @xcite .",
