    "under most current paradigms of active galactic nuclei , the broad emission lines seen in the optical spectra of such objects are due to emission originating in regions close to a supermassive black hole .",
    "orientation - dependent unification schemes ( e.g. scheuer 1987 , barthel 1989 ) posit that at large viewing angles this broad - line region is obscured by optically thick material ( a putative dusty torus ) . within this scheme , radio - loud quasars have been proposed to represent favorably oriented narrow - lined radio galaxies .",
    "broad - lined radio galaxies ( blrgs ) have both a visible host galaxy ( hence their identification on optical images as galaxies ) and broad lines in their spectra . on account of these broad emission lines , blrgs can be considered to be aligned to the observer at similar angles to the line of sight as the quasar population .",
    "this assumption is often made in statistical investigations of radio galaxies and quasars which are concerned with orientation , obscuration and relativistic motion .",
    "there is indeed evidence that some blrgs are at comparable angles to the lines of sight to quasars ( e.g. superluminal motion in some blrgs @xcite ) and that , statistically , they are closer to the line of sight than their narrow - lined counterparts ( hardcastle et al . 1998 ; gilbert & riley 1999 ) . from an analysis of the radio properties of blrgs in the 3cr sample , hardcastle et al .",
    "@xcite argue that blrgs are simply low - luminosity counterparts of quasars . in this picture , the objects are classified as blrgs because of the combined effects of the lower luminosity of the agn and the proximity to the host enabling the starlight to be clearly detected .    however , there are two lines of evidence arguing against the simple picture that all broad - lined radio galaxies are nearby , low - luminosity quasars .",
    "tadhunter et al .",
    "@xcite detect blrgs out to the redshift limit of their sample , thus overlapping with the quasars in redshift and power .",
    "this suggests a considerable range in the intrinsic luminosities of the broad - line agn for a given redshift or radio power .",
    "the authors favour this explanation over the possibility that the blrgs are simply partially obscured quasars , because of the large scatter seen in the correlation between radio and [ oiii ] luminosities .",
    "secondly , blrgs have been shown to be unusual in their fir spectral energy distribution .",
    "many blrgs show a short wavelength fir excess seen neither in nlrgs nor in quasars , which is presumably due to hot dust ( he s et al .",
    "in fact , the first blrg studied by iras already displayed this hot dust component ( miley et al .",
    "further work is underway to investigate how general this property is , using the iso satellite ( van bemmel et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ".    not all the broad - line radiation may be reaching us directly . combining results from optical spectropolarimetry with information on dust - induced reddening , cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest a continuous transition with increasing aspect angle from unobscured quasars to reddened blrg to nlrg .",
    "this argues that the obscuring torus does not have a distinct edge ( see also baker 1997 ) .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "model the optical agn radiation of blrgs with contributions from both dust - reddened and dust - scattered quasar light .",
    "corbett et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that broad - line emission may be scattered both from the inner wall of the postulated dust torus and from its polar regions by electrons or dust clouds distributed along the radio jet .",
    "it therefore seems likely that both the luminosity of the agn itself and its orientation play a role in whether an object is classified as a blrg or a quasar . in this paper",
    "we address the relative importance of these effects using radio and other data .",
    "determining the orientation of the blrg axis will be essential to discriminate between the possibilities and determine the location and nature of the hot dust .",
    "in addition to the brightness asymmetries of the jets and hotspots , which are crude indicators of orientation ( see e.g. hardcastle et al . 1998 ) , there are two other orientation indicators in the radio emission : depolarisation and hotspot spectral index asymmetries .",
    "depolarisation asymmetries related to orientation of powerful classical double radio sources was first reported by laing ( 1988 ) and garrington et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . using a sample of quasars and radio galaxies with",
    "one detected jet , these studies show that the jet side is generally less depolarised .",
    "this is most easily understood as an orientation effect , in which the jet is pointing towards us and the counterjet side is seen through a greater depth of depolarising material associated with the host galaxy .",
    "spectral asymmetries related to jet - sidedness in powerful radio sources with detected one - sided jets were first reported by garrington et al .",
    "the observations in that paper were insufficient to ascertain if the asymmetry was due to the hotspot material , or the extended lobe material : a situation complicated by the detection of spectral asymmetries in the extended material in another sample @xcite .",
    "dennett - thorpe et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter d97 ) addressed this issue and showed that the spectral asymmetries could be separated into two components : one in the lobe material related to the confinement of the radio lobe and a second , of interest here , in the hotspots due to relativistic effects .",
    "the spectral asymmetry of the hotspots has also been confirmed by ishwara - chandra & saikia ( 2000 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present results of dual frequency radio observations of blrgs and quasars taken for the purpose of investigating their orientation by use of the spectral and depolarisation asymmetries .",

    "comparison of the observations showed the position angle and percentage polarisation to be the same within @xmath43% for both runs , indicating that , as expected , the telescopes were stable over this time interval .",

    ", we can see that five sources ( 3c93 , 3c109 , 3c206 , 3c246 , 3c323.1 ) may be considered as ` quasars ' from their optical luminosity alone ( using schmidt & green s @xcite cosmology adjusted m@xmath10 criterion ) .",

    "[ sect : class ] , but 3c93 and 3c109 were not .",
    "as noted in appendix b , 3c109 is indeed an unusual object with apparently both high intrinsic reddening and a very blue underlying continuum .",
    "3c93 also has a highly reddened nucleus .",
    "in contrast , there is no evidence to suggest that 3c206 , 3c246 , 3c323.1 are anything other than low redshift quasars : i.e. at similar lines of sight and with similar intrinsic powers as their higher redshift counterparts .",
    "the remaining seven broad - lined sources whose m@xmath9 is below that for typical quasars include all of those whose lines show only ` broad wings ' .",
    "for all of these latter objects there is no information about the percentage of the flux density due to starlight : but these all have optical appearances of galaxies so we can safely assume @xmath4 50% of the observed light comes from the agn .",
    "in this case a@xmath112 would be required to bring these objects into the quasar luminosity range .",
    "we suggest that all these objects ( if the broad wings on the spectral lines in 3c381 are confirmed ) are typically luminous quasars seen through the edge of the obscuring torus .",
    "x - ray observations and analysis are not available for all sources in this sub - sample , but there is good evidence for excess absorption towards 3c219 @xcite .",
    "3c234 is probably the best candidate for an object at intermediate line of sight ( see appendix  b ) .",
    "finally we consider the three sources which have strong , unambiguous broad lines , and are not the quasars discussed above ( 3c17 , 3c332 and 3c287.1 ) .",
    "3c332 is a double peaked h@xmath8 emitter ( eh94 ) .",
    "3c93 is the only other such object in the sample .",
    "3c17 is also classified by eh94 as a ` disklike emitter ' but has an asymmetric line profile which can not be fitted with a simple disk model .",
    "it has a very large h@xmath8 fwhm ( 11500km / s ) , less than the fwhm of the double peaked lines , but substantially more ( at least a factor two ) than all other objects in this sample .",
    "we do not fully understand how this class of objects fits into the orientation model . in order to become typically luminous quasars these three objects",
    "are also required to suffer reddening of their central continuum source ( again typically a@xmath12 ) .",
    "3c287.1 may be either an intrinsically weak quasar or seen through absorbing material : the available evidence is not clear .",
    "sambruna et al .",
    "( 1999 ) report a surprising amount of absorption due to cold material in the asca spectra of _ both _ blrgs and quasars .",
    "they differentiate between blrgs and quasars on the basis of [ oiii ] luminosity . [ oiii ]",
    "luminosity is related to the intrinsic power of the source @xcite , and is believed to be isotropic to first order ( browne & murphy 1987 ; jackson & browne 1991 ) . however , there is strong evidence that some fraction of the [ oiii ] may be emitted in the obscured central regions ( jackson & browne 1990 ; he s et al .",
    "1993 ) . therefore , while the division of sambruna et al .",
    "is primarily by intrinsic power , it probably contains an additional orientation factor .",
    "we wish to divide the sources by orientation , so we reshuffle their objects into categories determined by the suggested orientations in this section .",
    "when classified in this manner , with ` blrg ' further from the line of sight , it appears that the blrgs in the sambruna et al .",
    "sample have significantly higher absorption column densities than the quasars , as expected .    in the light of these above considerations we divide the objects into the following categories .",
    "+ ia  objects with strong broad lines , blue continuum , and a weak host 3c206 , 3c246 , 3c323.1 + ib  objects with strong broad lines , a clear but inconspicuous nucleus and prominent host galaxy : 3c17 , 3c332 + iia  objects with strong broad lines , a prominent , reddened nucleus , and a relatively weak host : 3c93 , 3c109 , 3c287.1 + iib  radio galaxies with a broad winged component in their spectra : 3c33.1 , 3c219 , 3c234 , 3c381 + these classifications are based on observational parameters , but divided with reference to simple , orientation dependent models as follows .",
    "category ia contains the normal quasars , whilst less luminous versions of these are found in ib .",
    "the well - known nearby blrgs 3c382 and 3c390.3 are type i objects ( both objects are optically variable type  1 seyfert nuclei ) .",
    "their agn luminosity makes them borderline ia / ib , but their low redshift makes their hosts conspicuous .",
    "their starlight fraction estimated by eh94 is probably an underestimate , due to the effect of finite slit width .",
    "class iia objects are probably seen at grazing incidence to the nuclear torus , with class iib suffering more reddening and extinction due to intervening ( torus ? ) dust .",
    "the difference between classes iia and iib may be a result of the optical agn radiation of blrgs being a composite of dust scattered and dust transmitted light ( cohen et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "continued spectropolarimetry of blrgs is crucial to address the validity of our classification in the framework of the cohen et al . model . whether or not class  ii objects are at larger absolute angle to the line of sight than the quasars is dependent on the opening angle of the torus , which may exhibit large object to object variations , or may vary systematically with source power ( e.g. lawrence 1991 ; hill et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we note with interest that the smaller doppler factor required to explain the spectral asymmetries of the blrgs compared to the quasars rests on two class  ii sources , namely 3c234 and 3c109 .",
    "as there is good evidence that both these sources are observed at grazing angles to their tori , their jet lorentz factors may still be in the range of objects in class ib ( 3c234 ) and class ia ( 3c109 ) . in summary , in agreement with cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we consider it likely that class ii blrgs are , _ on average _ , at larger angles than class ia quasars .",
    "analysis of continuum radio images at two frequencies of a carefully selected sample of broad lined radio galaxies and low redshift quasars , reveals asymmetries in both depolarisation properties and spectra of the hotspot regions .",
    "these asymmetries are generally associated with the side of the detected jet .",
    "these results are in the same sense as the asymmetries previously reported by laing @xcite , garrington et al .",
    "@xcite , dennett - thorpe et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) , and can be understood as orientation effects : the depolarisation asymmetry as a line of sight effect , the spectral asymmetry as due to relativistic motion of the jet material on kiloparsec scales .",
    "the sense of the asymmetries are consistent with the previous results , and reinforces the idea that the population of blrgs is non - randomly oriented and that they are at close angles to the line of sight , similar to quasars .",
    "the magnitude of both the spectral and the depolarisation asymmetries is less than has been reported previously for the quasars .",
    "the smaller depolarisation asymmetry is explicable as a power / redshift effect .",
    "sources at higher redshift in flux limited samples ( i.e. also higher power ) are known to depolarise more rapidly @xcite , and thus the asymmetries are more pronounced .",
    "the increasing spectral asymmetry with power / redshift may also be easily explained if the asymmetry is caused by relativistic doppler effects in the hotspot material , if this has a curved spectrum .",
    "however , there is an indication of a difference in the magnitude of the spectral asymmetry between the classes of blrgs and quasars , which is not a power / redshift effect , but could be explained by ( some of ) the blrgs in the sample having lower doppler factors ( larger angle , or smaller bulk speeds ) than the quasars .",
    "although this result depends on just two sources , it is interesting to note that these two sources ( 3c234 , 3c109 ) are the ones for which there is good evidence from other observations that they are viewed at grazing incidence to the torus .    as well as the problem of classification of objects by different workers in different manners",
    ", there is the additional problem that both the slightly ` misdirected quasars ' and the lower power objects at lines of sight similar to the quasars are often classified , on observational grounds , as blrgs .",
    "we have made comments on each individual source regarding its likely position in a physically based orientation scheme and consider that , whilst somewhat incomplete and uncertain , it is preferable to most subjective or arbitrary numerical decisions that are presently used .    in summary",
    ", this work supports the idea the object class of blrgs is oriented preferentially towards our line of sight , and probably contains objects at somewhat larger angles than the quasar population , as well as less luminous quasars .",
    "the warm dust peak , detected in some of the blrgs , has yet to be explained .",
