    "the rotational evolution of a solar type star during the main sequence lifetime is deeply affected by the level of internal coupling that is established between the radiative core and the convective envelope at various ages , which competes with the angular momentum loss produced by a magnetised stellar wind . in spite of the observational constraints gathered so far , the identification of the physical process(es ) ensuring a uniform rotation of the core , i.e.",
    ", a substantial rotational coupling by the age of the sun , is still lacking .",
    "observational information to constrain the rotational evolution of low mass stars currently comes from two major sources : helioseismology and rotation period surveys in open clusters .",
    "the former provides evidence of a latitudinal dependence of solar rotation in the convection zone ( cz ) , the existence of a thin shear layer ( tachocline ) at the top of the radiative core , and an almost uniform rotation at greater depths ( at least down to @xmath3 @xmath4 , see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , rotation period measurements of open cluster members effectively constrain the rotational evolution because of our fairly reliable estimate of their age .",
    "a satisfactory theoretical explanation of these data is still missing owing to the limited knowledge of the different processes involved in the evolution of stellar angular momentum .    during the pre - main sequence ( pms )",
    "contraction phase , stars are spun up , but contemporarily suffer a remarkable angular momentum draining by the interaction with their circumstellar discs @xcite . very young ( viz .",
    ", a few myr old ) open clusters already show significant spread and mass - dependent structures in their rotation period distributions @xcite . on the main sequence ( ms ) , angular momentum loss by a magnetised wind in solar - type stars @xcite",
    "was early recognised by @xcite as the main cause of their rotational evolution , contrasting with the more massive stars behaviour ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "surface period measurements are sensitive to the internal rotational profile .",
    "phenomenological models of ms angular momentum evolution @xcite have been successful in reproducing the observations if a certain amount of differential rotation between the radiative core and the convective envelope is allowed . in those models",
    "the exchange of angular momentum between the core and the envelope is governed by a single parameter , i.e. , a coupling time - scale @xmath5 which fixes the rate at which angular momentum is transferred between the two regions to establish rigid rotation .",
    "the observed distribution of the rotation periods in open clusters can be reproduced by assuming that @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath6 myr for the stars that begun their evolution on the zams as fast rotators ( i.e. , with an initial rotation period of a few days ) , while it is remarkably longer ( @xmath7 myr ) for slow rotators ( i.e. , with initial periods of several days ) .",
    "an understanding of the processes eventually ensuring rotational coupling between core and envelope and within the core itself is still lacking .",
    "the issue is also closely related to a number of currently open questions in stellar evolution theory .",
    "for instance , @xcite tentatively explained the observed correlation between li over - depletion and the presence of hot jupiters around ms stars on the basis of these rotational evolution models because an initial slow rotation is a characteristic of stars with exoplanets , owing to their prolonged interaction with a proto - planetary disc during their pms phase .",
    "such objects are characterized by a long coupling time ( @xmath7 myr ) which leads to the development of a sizeable differential rotation at the core - envelope interface . a sizeable shear produces an enhancement of the turbulent mixing which in turn makes li destruction more efficient .",
    "to address the internal coupling processes from a theoretical point of view , @xcite discussed the stability of toroidal magnetic fields in radiative stellar interiors .",
    "he suggested that , due to the vertically stabilizing effect of the subadiabatic stratification of the core , motions associated with hydro - magnetic instabilities are constrained to the locally horizontal direction and their mean effect can be described through an enhancement of the momentum and magnetic field diffusivities up to turbulent values several orders of magnitude greater than their molecular counterparts .",
    "@xcite , hereafter , solved the equations for angular momentum transport and toroidal magnetic field evolution in a solar - type star throughout the ms lifespan , assuming axial symmetry and a pre - existent ( fossil ) poloidal magnetic field .",
    "they used a finite elements technique , finding that a sizeable toroidal field develops from the winding - up of the poloidal field by the differential rotation . when it becomes strong enough , the maxwell stresses begin to react to any further amplification of the field and the system enters into a new regime characterized by torsional alfvn oscillations .",
    "this phase displays a remarkable energy dissipation as soon as the oscillations along neighbour magnetic field lines get in opposition of phase ( phase - mixing ) , owing to their slightly different periods , as a consequence of the density stratification and poloidal field gradient inside the core @xcite .",
    "find that the poloidal field geometry is an important feature to determine the time - scale for angular momentum redistribution inside the core , because phase mixing ( much more efficiently than diffusion ) enhances angular momentum redistribution and toroidal field reconnection on surfaces of constant poloidal field , thus producing a quasi - stationary regime with an angular velocity almost constant on them , according to ferraro isorotation theorem @xcite .",
    "another key finding is the impossibility to achieve a state of uniform rotation of the core within the solar age with molecular viscosity alone .",
    "later work by @xcite ( ) , based on a finite difference numerical approach , confirmed these results and remarkably the `` viscosity deficit '' problem .",
    "we solve the same coupled , non - homogeneous partial differential equations ( pdes ) of and for angular momentum transport and toroidal field evolution , with the technique of eigenfunction expansion @xcite .",
    "we find an exact analytic solution of the problem that can be expressed as a series expansion .",
    "formal substitution of the series into the equations yields an infinite system of linear , first order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that can be truncated according to the required degree of accuracy . to this purpose , we complement our implementation with an analytic formula for the truncation error . in principle , our spectral method has no limitation in terms of reynolds number and can be used as a benchmark to test the accuracy of other numerical methods to solve the same problem .",
    "this new rigorous treatment of a classic mhd problem is the novelty reported in the present work",
    ". we shall compare the results of our approach with those of previous works by and , briefly discussing its advantages for the study of the angular momentum transport in a radiative stellar core .",
    "our treatment is particularly relevant for an accurate study of the phase mixing process for which previous numerical techniques were not capable of a rigorous treatment of the contribution of subgrid lengthscales .",
    "we model the ms evolution of specific angular momentum in the core of a 1@xmath8 star solving the angular momentum transport equation and the toroidal component of the induction equation .",
    "we consider an inertial reference frame with the origin @xmath9 at the barycentre of the star and the polar axis @xmath10 along the rotation axis .",
    "spherical polar coordinates are adopted , @xmath11 being the distance from @xmath9 , @xmath12 the colatitude measured from the north pole , and @xmath13 the azimuthal angle .",
    "the present calculation is based on a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "we restrict our domain to the radiative core , assuming that the angular momentum transport time - scale in the cz is much shorter than in the radiative interior , as turbulent viscosity there is at least @xmath14 orders of magnitude greater than molecular .",
    "the system is assumed to be strictly axisymmetric .",
    "the @xcite expressions for molecular viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are : @xmath15    as pointed out by , molecular viscosity is far too low to reconcile the differential rotation regime that is likely established in young , solar - type stars with the uniform rotation of the core of the present sun as deduced by helioseismology . to overcome this `` viscosity deficit '' problem , following , we introduce an artificial viscosity enhancement parameter @xmath16 such that : @xmath17 this suffices to the purpose of presenting our method and comparing the results with previous works . @xcite and @xcite present a possible identification and physical explanation for such an effect .",
    "application of eqs.([eq : diff ] ) requires the knowledge of the stellar structure ( viz .",
    "the depth dependence of density and temperature ) .",
    "here we use the so - called model s of the sun introduced by @xcite for the whole computation .",
    "the evolution of the stellar structure on the ms has a minor impact on our computations and can be safely ignored .",
    "we neglect the eddington - sweet circulation because of the extremely long time - scale that is of the order of @xmath18 yr .",
    "note that a differential rotation which is not uniform along cylindrical surfaces around the @xmath10 axis drives a meridional circulation because of the non - potential character of the associated centrifugal force .",
    "we shall neglect such a circulation because the subadiabatic stratification of the core effectively opposes motions in the radial direction , strongly reducing its velocity .",
    "our assumptions rule out the possibility of poloidal field regeneration by dynamo action and 3d magnetic instabilities . according to the analysis of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities in radiative regions by @xcite",
    ", however , the fastest - growing instability should be the @xmath19 mode of the tayler instability , which may be included as an additional maxwell stress term in our equations .",
    "our assumption of an axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field is justified by the fact that in a differentially rotating core any initially non - axisymmetric field component is smoothed out by winding up and diffusion on a time - scale @xmath20 much shorter than the diffusion time - scale of the axisymmetric component .",
    "3.1 ) estimates @xmath20 of the order of @xmath21 yr for the sun on the zams .",
    "note that if the initial field is so strong to oppose the winding up by the initial differential rotation , it can possibly find a non - axisymmetric equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the core would be rotating rigidly from the outset being completely coupled by the strong field and the angular momentum would be transported on the alfven time scale which is of the order of @xmath22 yr , i.e. , much shorter than the wind braking time scale .",
    "we do not treat this case because such a strong coupling inside a young solar - like star is not in agreement with the phenomenological models of rotational evolution requiring coupling time scales of @xmath23 yr to account for the observations , as discussed in sect .",

    "[ eq : omega ] and [ eq : field ] , but it requires knowledge of initial conditions which are generally not available .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field within the core is expected as a relic of dynamo action during pms .",
    "this problem has been addressed by @xcite for stars like the sun .",
    "their numerical calculations go from an age of a few myr to about @xmath33 myr and account for the dynamical retreat of the cz during the pms evolution .",
    "they find that non - axisymmetric modes are the most readily excited in young pms models , but they are gradually replaced by axisymmetric ones as the star approaches the zams .",
    "moreover , any early non - axisymmetric field is rapidly diffused away , as already noted at the end of sect .",
    "[ basic_ass ] . we shall therefore consider a stationary , axisymmetric configuration for the poloidal seed field , assigned through a flux function @xmath27 , and specialize our considerations to the case in which @xmath27 can be factorized as @xmath34 . specifically ,",

    "the actual value of @xmath43 does not significantly affect the results , provided that it is chosen in such a way that the cylinder where @xmath44 contains a negligible amount of angular momentum .",
    "we are interested in the global response of the core to an external wind braking torque , which we take into account through a suitable specification of the boundary conditions at @xmath41 .    specifically , on the radial boundaries we assign the angular momentum fluxes .",
    "at the inner boundary @xmath43 , we assume it to be negligible . at the outer boundary @xmath41 ,",
    "the angular momentum flux is equal to that lost via the magnetised wind : @xmath45 for simplicity , we neglect any dependence of the wind torque and @xmath46 on the latitude , which is in any case a second - order effect , given the high turbulent viscosity of the cz which makes the amplitude of the latitudinal shear on top of the boundary significantly smaller than that in the core . for the specification of the function @xmath47 , which includes a model of the wind braking process , see appendix [ app : wind ] .",
    "for the toroidal magnetic field we use  insulating \" boundary conditions : @xmath48 they prevent the development of toroidal magnetic fields of unrealistically large intensities , as shown by , e.g. , @xcite in numerical simulations of the solar tachocline .",

    ". nevertheless , even if the poloidal field diffused outward , the strong radial shear present in the tachocline would wind it up producing a strong azimuthal field . in the mildly subadiabatic environment of the tachocline",
