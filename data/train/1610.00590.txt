    "treatment of the quark - gluon plasma evolution and hadronic freeze - out in relativistic heavy ion collisions is well established and largely understood .",
    "major success has been achieved in extracting qgp properties such as @xmath3/s @xcite .",
    "quantifying the uncertainties in the extracted qgp properties presents a major challenge , however . beyond the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients ,",
    "the effects of a possible critical point and finite @xmath4 need to be quantified .",
    "in addition , the physics of the initial state and pre - equilibrium dynamics are still conceptually challenging and are a major source of uncertainty for the extraction of qgp properties .",
    "rigorous model to data comparisons are difficult to perform , as there is a large number of interconnected parameters with non - factorizable data dependencies .",
    "experimental data have also correlated uncertainties .",
    "these issues necessitate the utilization of novel optimization techniques , such as bayesian statistics and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods .",
    "as the simulations of heavy ion collisions require considerable amount of computational resources , new interpolation techniques based on emulators are also needed to predict the model output .",
    "these statistical methods have already been applied with great success to pb+pb collisions at the lhc @xcite . in the following",
    "we extend the analysis to the au+au collisions in the rhic beam energy scan .",
    "we simulate the heavy ion collisions at rhic - bes energies using the hybrid model described in ref .  @xcite . in this model , the initial state produced by the urqmd hadron+strings cascade @xcite .",
    "the earliest possible starting time for hydrodynamical evolution is when the two colliding nuclei have passed through each other : @xmath5 . at the transport - to - hydro transition ,",
    "the microscopic particle properties ( energy , baryon number ) are mapped to densities using 3-d gaussians with `` smearing '' parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( = @xmath8 times gaussian width @xmath9 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution is done with ( 3 + 1)d relativistic viscous hydrodynamics @xcite , with a constant value of @xmath0 throughout the evolution , which is provided as input .",
    "transition from hydro back to transport ( `` particlization '' ) is performed when the energy density @xmath10 in the hydro cells reaches the switching value @xmath11 .",
    "the iso - energy density hypersurface is constructed using the cornelius routine @xcite .",
    "the basics of the bayesian analysis procedure and model emulation have been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the bayesian posterior probability distribution is sampled using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , which is a random walk in parameter space , where each step is accepted or rejected based on a relative likelihood .",
    "we initialize @xmath12 random walkers at random positions in the input parameter space . as in @xcite ,",
    "the input parameter combinations were sampled using the maximin latin hypercube method , which attempts to optimize the sample by maximizing the minimum distance between the design points .    to calculate the likelihood , one must be able to determine the model output @xmath13 for an arbitrary input parameter combination @xmath14 . as the simulations typically take several hours to run ,",
    "it is highly impractical to run the full model during statistical analysis . instead",
    ", the model is emulated with gaussian processes , which provide very general , non - parametric interpolation of the physics model , where the uncertainty related to the given estimate is included in a natural way .",
    "to verify the results , 100 random parameter combinations were drawn from the posterior and the model output for these combinations were predicted by the gaussian process emulator . in addition",
    ", full model simulations were run with the median values .",
    "example results for charged particle elliptic flow @xmath15 at 19.6 gev and 39 gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emuexp ] .",
    "emulator predictions are shown as box - and - whisker plots , where the whiskers represent the smallest and the largest 25% of the prediction values , and the box covers the middle 50% .",
    "the results demonstrate the quality of both the calibration ( agreement with the experimental values is good ) and the emulation ( the simulation points are close to the median of the gp predictions ) .",
    "transverse momentum distributions for @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath18 gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndpt62 ] .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath19 data were not explicitly part of the statistical analysis , but @xmath20 ratio and mean @xmath21 were used instead . it was already argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that knowledge of particle yields and mean @xmath21 should be enough to completely describe the @xmath21 spectra .",
    "the very good agreement between model results and data seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : bes_boxplots ] , again using the box - and - whisker representation .",
    "no parameter values are fully excluded with the present uncertainties in likelihood calculation , and so the range of the posterior values in most cases matches with the prior",
    ". however , the median and peak values of @xmath0 move clearly towards lower values at higher collision energies , confirming the findings in ref .  @xcite .     and the switching energy density @xmath11.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and the switching energy density @xmath11.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "the collision energy dependence of @xmath0 posterior distributions suggests that shear viscosity depends not only on temperature @xmath24 but also on baryochemical potential @xmath4 , and the parametrizations of the shear viscosity should include both dependencies .",
    "once such a parametrization is formulated , it should be possible to find parameter values which fit the whole beam energy scan range simultaneously .",
    "current analysis focus was on the properties of bulk qcd matter and utilized only rhic - bes data on soft hadrons . to improve the constraints on model parameters , data from more beam energies and asymmetric collision systems such as p+pb needs to be included . in order to reduce theoretical uncertainties ,",
    "our understanding of the initial state needs to be improved and a realistic eos that has the proper @xmath25 limit must be included .",
    "it is also important to note that the statistical analysis is model agnostic , allowing us in the future to perform quantitative comparisons between multiple models and verify / falsify different conceptual approaches within one common framework .",
