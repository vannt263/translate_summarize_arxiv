    "the successful fabrication of iii - v ( in , mn)as and ( ga , mn)as through low temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( lt - mbe ) has generated extensive research into diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors ( dfs ) @xcite .",

    "after almost two decades efforts , the curie temperature @xmath11 of ( ga , mn)as thin films has been improved to as high as 200 k@xcite .",
    "one of the major intrinsic difficulties is the low solid solubility of @xmath12 substitution for @xmath13 , which makes it difficult to enhance the concentration of mn while controlling the homogeneity of thin films .",
    "mn@xmath9 substitution for ga@xmath14 provides not only local moments but also hole carriers . during the fabrication of thin films ,",
    "some mn@xmath9 easily get into the interstitial sites and become a double donor , which makes it difficult to determine precisely the amount of mn that substitutes for ga at the ionic sites @xcite . investigating some dfs systems with more controllable",
    "spin and carrier density might be helpful in understanding the general mechanism of ferromagnetism .",
    "recently , several bulk form dfs families that are derivatives of feas - based high temperature superconductors have been reported @xcite . among them , the @xmath4 of 122 type bulk form ( ba , k)(zn , mn)@xmath15as@xmath15 reaches @xmath5 180k @xcite , which is already comparable with the record @xmath4 of ( gamn)as @xcite .",
    "@xmath0sr measurements have shown that the relation between static internal field and curie temperature observed in i - ii - v li(zn , mn)as @xcite , 1111 type ( la , ba)(zn , mn)aso @xciteand 122 type ( ba , k)(zn , mn)@xmath15as@xmath15 @xcite dfss all fall into the scaling observed in ( ga , mn)as thin films@xcite , indicating they all share a common mechanism for the ferromagnetic exchange interaction . the availability of a specimen in bulk form also enables the nmr measurements of dfs . through @xmath16li nmr of li(zn , mn)p @xcite , ding _",

    "are chemically stable elements , and the concentrations of charge and spin can be precisely controlled . very recently , by controlling the li concentration and by doping mn into the direct gap semiconductor liznp ( gap @xmath23 ev@xcite ) , li(zn , mn)p @xcite has been found to experience a transition into ferromagnetic state below @xmath5 34k with a low carrier density of 10@xmath24/@xmath25 .",
    "this carrier density is @xmath5 3 orders smaller than that of ( ga , mn)as , li(zn , mn)as and ( ba , k)(zn , mn)@xmath15as@xmath15 , leaving the open questions about the mechanism behind ferromagnetism of li(zn , mn)p .    in this paper , we use @xmath0sr to investigate the ferromagnetism of a i - ii - v dfs li(zn , mn)p with @xmath4 = 22 k. our @xmath0sr results demonstrate that a nearly 100% ferromagnetic ordered volume develops below @xmath4 , indicating the homogenous distribution of mn@xmath9 atoms .",
    "this result is consistent with nmr measurements of the same specimen .",
    "we also investigated the spin dynamics of mn spins , and found that li(zn , mn)p also falls into the same scalings of internal field and @xmath4 observed for ( ga , mn)as and other bulk dfss , indicating that li(zn , mn)p belongs to the dfs families that share a common mechanism of ferromagnetic exchange interaction despite its much lower carrier density .",
    "furthermore , taking advantage of decoupled carrier and spin doping , we studied the carrier doping effect on the ferromagnetic ordered state .",
    "our experimental results show that overdoping li suppresses both @xmath4 and the saturation moments .",

    "the lattice constants @xmath31 of li@xmath6(zn@xmath20mn@xmath21)p and li@xmath6(zn@xmath2mn@xmath22)p are shown in fig .",

    "this is comparable to the line width of pure cu metal , indicating the high quality of these polycrystals .",

    "2 , we show the time spectra of the zero - field ( zf ) @xmath0sr on the polycrystalline sample li@xmath1(zn@xmath2mn@xmath22)p which has a @xmath4 = 22 k. it can be seen that the time spectra clearly displays an increase in relaxation rate below t = 15 k. we note that no clear oscillation is observed even at 2 k ; a similar situation is observed in ( ga , mn)as @xcite and li(zn , mn)as @xcite as well . this can be attributed to the random distribution of mn moments in real space because mn substitution for zn is random .",
    "this makes the local field at the muon site highly random even in the ferromagnetic ground state , and zf precession signals are subsequently strongly damped .",
    "the random distribution of mn moments has also been shown by li(mn ) nmr lineshapes , which displays a large distribution between 61 mhz and 66 mhz @xcite .",
    "the broad nmr line arises from the distribution of hyperfine fields at li(mn ) sites , which can be as large as @xmath5 0.3 tesla@xcite .",
    "note that the transferred hyperfine coupling between li nuclear spins and mn electrons is much weaker than those between zn / mn and as .",
    "currently , we do not know the exact muon sites in li(zn , mn)p , but relatively large hyperfine fields at muon sites are likely .",
    "we employed a two component function to analyze the zf spectra ( the fitting function is identical to the one used for li(zn , mn)as , as explained in the method section of ref . 13 ) .",
    "one component is for a static magnetic field with a lorentzian distribution .",
    "this is expected for dilute mn moments randomly substituting zn sites , representing the magnetically ordered volume .",
    "the other component is an exponential function , representing the volume fraction of fluctuating paramagnetism .",

    "3 , we show the @xmath0sr time spectra measured in a weak transverse field ( wtf ) of 30 oe . as stated previously , the average internal magnetic field at the muon sites should be much larger than the applied field , and the oscillation amplitude is therefore an indicator of the paramagnetic volume @xcite .",
    "wtf-@xmath0sr measurements provide direct information of the magnetic volume fraction @xcite . clearly , the amplitude of oscillation becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath35 , indicating the suppression of the paramagnetic volume .",
    "we show the results of size of magnetically ordered volume derived from wtf-@xmath0sr in fig . 4 , and compare it with those derived from the measurements in zf .",
    "both are in good agreement , supporting the validity of our analysis of the zf-@xmath0sr spectra using a two - component function .",
    "we note that the growth of ferromagnetic ordered volume below t@xmath36 in li(zn , mn)p is more gradual than previous reported li(zn , mn)as @xcite and 122 type ( ba , k)(zn , mn)@xmath15as@xmath15 @xcite , this is primarily due to the distribution of t@xmath36 arising from sample synthesis .",
    "we have also conducted longitudinal - field @xmath0sr at 200 oe ( not shown ) , and confirmed the relaxation observed in this material is due mostly to static magnetic field .",
    "the ordered volume fraction starts to grow below @xmath5 22k , indicating a ferromagnetic transition that takes place at @xmath3722k , which is consistent with the magnetization measurements .",
    "magnetic volume fraction reaches up to nearly @xmath38 at the base temperature of 2 k , implying that static magnetic order develops in almost the entire sample volume .",
    "this result is again consistent with the nmr observation that no nmr signals arising from magnetic impurities or mn clusters are observed @xcite .",

    "it has been shown that doping mn@xmath9 only in li@xmath6(zn@xmath7mn@xmath8)p , without excess lithium doping , will result in a paramagnetic ground state @xcite . only with excess li",

    "we can see that all three specimens display strong ferromagnetic signals in both @xmath46 and @xmath47 curves .",
    "for example , @xmath46 of li@xmath48(zn@xmath20mn@xmath21)p shows an strong enhancement below @xmath11 = 26 k ( @xmath11 is extrapolated from @xmath49 , see ref .",
    "14 ) , and m(h ) has a parallelogram shape with a coercive field of @xmath5 20 oe .",
    "another feature of the li@xmath48(zn@xmath20mn@xmath21)p specimen is that zfc and fc curves display a bifurcation shortly below @xmath4 .",
    "we fitted the @xmath46 curve above @xmath4 according to the curie - wess law , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is curie constant and @xmath41 the weiss temperature , and derived the effective paramagnetic moment , @xmath43 , from the curie constant @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath43 is @xmath5 3@xmath52/mn for @xmath33 = 0.07 .",
    "this value is smaller than 4.5 @xmath52/mn of li@xmath53(zn@xmath54mn@xmath55)p in ref .",
    "@xmath43 @xmath5 5 - 6 @xmath52/mn is expected for high state mn@xmath9 ions .",
    "apparently , the suppression of @xmath43 is not only arising from the competition of the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction of n.n .",
    "mn@xmath9 , but also from the overdoped carriers , as will be shown in detail in the following .",
    "we plot curie temperature ( @xmath4 ) , weiss temperature ( @xmath41 ) , the effective moment ( @xmath43 ) , and the saturation moment ( @xmath42 , the value measured at @xmath56 k and h = 500 oe ) versus the nominal excess li concentration in fig .",
    "for li concentration equal to 1 ( i.e. , y = 0 ) , li(zn@xmath20mn@xmath21)p remains a paramagnetic ground state .",
    "we therefore define t@xmath36 , @xmath41 , m@xmath57 and m@xmath58 as zero , and plot zero in fig .",
    "6(c ) for comparison .",
    "clearly , we can see that all four parameters display qualitatively similar li concentration dependence .",
    "they increase with li concentration initially , reach a maximum at @xmath33 = 0.07 , and then start to decrease when overdoped with li .",
    "to examine if the same trend is valid in a different mn concentration , we also investigate these parameters in li@xmath6(zn@xmath2mn@xmath22)p ( with @xmath45 = 0.10 and @xmath39 , 0.10 , 0.12 and 0.15 ) , and show the results in fig .",
    "the situation is similar to the case of the @xmath45 = 0.07 specimens .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 first increase from @xmath59 to @xmath39 , reach a maximum at @xmath60 , and then decrease from @xmath60 to @xmath61 for li@xmath6(zn@xmath2mn@xmath22)p .",
    "we tabulate all these parameters in table 1 .",
    "it has been theoretically proposed that in diluted magnetic semiconductors , spins are mediated by hole carriers through rkky interaction @xcite . from nmr measurements",
    "@xcite of li@xmath1(zn@xmath2mn@xmath22)p , it has been shown that the spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath62 of li(0 ) sites , where zero means no mn at n.n .",
    "zn sites for li , display a korringa behavior , i.e. , fermi surface excitations of a small number of conduction carriers . the @xmath62 of li(mn ) site shows a t - independent behavior caused by spin fluctuations , i.e. , representing local moments .",
    "this provides direct and convincing experimental evidence that fermi degenerate conduction carriers mediate the mn - mn spin interactions through the p - d exchange interaction , and that the mn - mn spin interaction is long - ranged , rather than a nearest - neighbor exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "the rkky exchange interaction can be written as , j @xmath5 cos(2@xmath63r)/r@xmath64 , where @xmath63 is the radius of fermi surface ( assuming the fermi surface is a spherical shape ) and @xmath65 the distance between two localized moments .",
    "the first oscillation period of the rkky interaction supports ferromagnetic coupling . in our case , doping more li introduces more carrier , and subsequently modifies the density of states and , therefore , the shape of fermi surface .",
    "the modified fermi surface affects the period of oscillation , as well as the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "we conducted @xmath0sr investigation of a bulk form i - ii - v dfs li@xmath6(zn@xmath7mn@xmath8)p .",
    "our @xmath0sr results confirm the development of ferromagnetic ordering below @xmath4 with a nearly 100% magnetically ordered volume . despite its much lower carrier density , li@xmath6(zn@xmath7mn@xmath8)p shares a common mechanism for the ferromagnetic exchange interaction with ( ga , mn)as , li(zn , mn)as , 1111 type ( la , ba)(zn , mn)aso and 122 type ( ba , k)(zn , mn)@xmath15as@xmath15 .",
    "taking advantage of the decoupled nature of the carrier and spin doping in li@xmath6(zn@xmath7mn@xmath8)p , we investigated , for the first time , the influence of overdoped carriers on the ferromagnetic ordered state of a dfs .",
