    "<S> furthermore , the production and rapid decay of a single neutral system at rest or moving in the beam line would be difficult to detect relative to the continuum qed backgrounds , due to a preponderance of noninteracting beam particles and synchrotron radiation .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose two distinct methods for producing a moving true muonium atom in @xmath32 collisions . in both methods </S>",

    "<S> the production point of the ( @xmath3 ) and its decay point are thus spatially displaced along the beam direction . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath65 state decays with a @xmath66  ps lifetime , so it moves @xmath67  cm of proper distance before decaying to @xmath32 , a length enhanced in the lab frame by the @xmath48 factor ( to 16.8  cm in the @xmath59 example ) . </S>",
    "<S> one thus can observe the appearance of @xmath32 events with a @xmath52-dependent set of lifetimes .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for continuum muon pair production @xmath68 just above threshold is the born cross section enhanced by the sommerfeld - schwinger - sakharov ( sss ) threshold coulomb resummation factor  @xcite @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 } \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath72 is the velocity of either of the @xmath73 in their c.m .  </S>",

    "<S> the entire set of ortho - true muonium @xmath79 @xmath80 bohr bound - state resonances with @xmath81 is produced , with weights @xmath82 and spaced with increasing density according to the bohr energies @xmath83 . by duality </S>",
    "<S> , the rates smeared over energies above and below threshold should be indistinguishable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total production of bound states in @xmath20 relative to the @xmath68 relativistic lepton pair rate is of order @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in practice the production rate is also reduced by the bohr energy divided by the finite width of the beam energies , since only collisions in the energy window @xmath85 are effective in producing bound states . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the beam resolution is of order @xmath86  mev , the effective @xmath87 is reduced by a further @xmath88 , leading to a production of @xmath0 at @xmath89 of the standard @xmath90 rate .    </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath0 state in the fisr method is produced through a single @xmath91 photon , @xmath79 states ( and not @xmath92 ) are produced , which decay almost always to @xmath50 pairs , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fisr ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that this holds even for radiative transitions through the sequences @xmath93 , since the intermediate @xmath94 states do not annihilate .    the @xmath0 bound states , once produced , </S>",
    "<S> can in principle be studied by exposure to @xmath95 laser or microwave bursts , or dissociated into free @xmath73 by passing through a foil . </S>",
    "<S> because of the novel kinematics of the fisr , the true muonium state can be produced within a laser cavity . for example </S>",
    "<S> , an intense laser source can conceivably excite the @xmath22 state of the atom to a @xmath94 state before the former s annihilation decay . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath96 state produced in this way has a lifetime of ( 15.4  ps)@xmath97 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this allows precision spectroscopy of true muonium , including measurements of the @xmath96-@xmath98 and other splittings . </S>",
    "<S> laser spectroscopy of @xmath99 atoms is reviewed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a second production mechanism , @xmath100 , which can be used for high - energy colliding beams with conventional configuration . </S>",
    "<S> it has the advantage that the production rate is independent of beam resolution , and removes the ( @xmath3 ) completely from the beam line since the atom recoils against a co - produced hard @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> while the production of the real @xmath48 costs an additional factor of @xmath77 in the rate , the kinematics is exceptionally clean : since the process is quasi - two - body , the @xmath48 is nearly monochromatic [ neglecting the @xmath0 binding energy ] as a function of the total c.m.beam energy @xmath101 , @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath0 lifetime is enhanced by the dilation factor @xmath103 .     </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath106 is large compared to @xmath107 , and its angle from the beam is large , one also can have significant radiation from the @xmath35 lines . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if the hard @xmath48 is emitted by a @xmath35 , the true muonium state is formed in the para @xmath92 @xmath108 state , which leads to two - photon annihilation decays . in this case </S>",
