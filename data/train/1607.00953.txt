    "no oscillations were seen in the forward - backward asymmetry spectra , and there were also no discontinuous jumps in either the initial or baseline asymmetry .",
    "this , combined with the absence of a kubo - toyabe relaxation ( ruling out effects from nuclear moments ) , hints that dynamic moments with no long - range order exist in the sample .",
    "this can be modelled by a two - component exponential relaxation @xmath68 which takes into account a slowly - relaxing background with amplitude @xmath69 and relaxation rate @xmath70 , and a further signal with amplitude @xmath71 and a faster relaxation rate @xmath72 .",

    "exponential relaxation corresponds to either dynamic moments with a single correlation time within the resolution of the spectrometer and an unknown field distribution,@xcite or a dilute distribution of static moments.@xcite the slower background relaxation ( with constant @xmath76 ) could arise due to the intrinsic magnetic moments of the iron in _ t_-",

    "t_- , it is likely that the onset of magnetism is coupled to the superconducting order parameter .",
    "it should be noted that at all measured temperatures @xmath72 is large , but the relative amplitude @xmath78 is small , indicating a very low density of moments with a large distribution of stray fields .    we have carried out simulations to explore the effect of a system of dilute , dynamic spins which could arise from localized magnetic impurities within the layers .",
    "our results are consistent with experimental observations if the concentration of such impurities is @xmath79 and the fluctuation rate of these spins is @xmath80@xmath81 ( this is shown in the black line plotted in fig .",
    "[ zffig ] ) , although it is possible to achieve good agreement with higher concentrations of impurity spins with correspondingly higher fluctuation rates .",
    "however , our x - ray diffraction data rule out any magnetic impurity phase at a higher concentration than the per cent level , and lower concentrations have been excluded by the simulations ( as they do not agree with the data ) .",
    "simulations of static spin distributions also did not fit the data and so we conclude that the fluctuations of these dilute spins are important ( the situation is reminiscent of effects observed in spin glasses@xcite ) .",
    "the moments were found to be on the order of @xmath82 , which suggests the magnetic phase could arise due to atomic iron or iron - based impurities in the layers , similar to those found in .@xcite we think this more likely than the low - moment ( @xmath83@xmath84 ) uniform magnetic phase of uncertain origin postulated by ref .  .",

    "the similarity of the superconducting properties demonstrates that the superconducting ground state is remarkably insensitive to these differences in magnetism .",
    "moreover , this supports the conclusion that the gap is isotropic because a ground state with nodes might be expected to be far more susceptible to the presence of impurities , which may be the source of these sample - dependent differences .",
