    "in a world with extra large space dimensions , of the order of some microns or less , as postulated in @xcite , the gravitational field sees all the dimensions , whereas the standard model fields are confined to the usual world , or brane , of three space dimensions .",
    "thus , the four dimensional spacetime of the brane can be seen as embedded in the @xmath0 dimensional spacetime of the whole world . in this setup",
    "several different problems are tackled . for instance , one solves , in a way , the hierarchy problem , since both the planck scale and the electroweak scale can be made of the same order , and so quantum gravity , being a electroweak scale phenomenon , can be experimentally tested . indeed , by smashing particles against each other in experiments with the new generation accelerators or in eventual cosmic ray collisions",
    ", one can produce black holes , or perhaps other spacetimes with different causal structure , with tiny masses and radii . as this is a gravitational phenomenon , and the gravitational field spreads into all dimensions , the newly created spacetimes probe all the spacetime dimensions , and in addition render visible some quantum effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "now , since in this setting one might expose quantum gravity and large extra dimension phenomena , in order to study the higher dimensional black holes , or other spacetimes with different causal structure , formed in the collision of particles , one should consider studying these objects in possible natural extensions to the theory of general relativity , conceivably appropriate to a further quantum framework development .",
    "the action of general relativity in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions is proportional to the integral of the cosmological constant plus the ricci scalar , and possible extensions should include powers of the riemann tensor , such as the kretschmann scalar , powers of the ricci tensor , and powers of the ricci scalar @xcite . in principle one has to choose a criterion to pick up the right combination of curvature scalars .",
    "for instance , adopting the criterion of keeping the same degrees of freedom , one may wonder what is the most natural generalization of general relativity for other dimensions .",
    "such a generalization is given by the lovelock action @xcite , where essentially one keeps the field equations second order .",
    "in more detail , the lovelock theory looks for an action which when properly varied yields symmetric tensors that are functions of the metric and its first and second spacetime derivatives , and divergence free . in four dimensions the corresponding action is the einstein - hilbert action , proportional to the cosmological constant and the ricci scalar . when varied , the einstein - hilbert action yields the einstein tensor and the metric tensor , the only tensors that display the above properties and contribute to the equations of motion . in dimensions",
    "higher than four lovelock found that only certain precise combinations of higher powers of the curvature scalars could enter in the action @xcite .",
    "the interpretation in physical , geometric and topological terms of these precise combinations was put forward by teitelboim and zanelli @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", one can first argue that in zero spacetime dimensions , a spacetime point , there is a zero dimensional topological invariant which is a numerical constant , called the cosmological constant .",
    "when this term is integrated in one or in two dimensions to form an action , i.e. , when the term is dimensionally continued to the next odd or even dimension , it contributes to the equations of motion , which in this case are somewhat trivial , giving either a zero metric or a zero cosmological constant with an indeterminate metric .",
    "now , in two dimensions , there is also the corresponding topological invariant .",
    "this invariant , the euler characteristic , is obtained by integrating the so called gauss - bonnet term . in two dimensions",
    "the gauss - bonnet term is the two dimensional ricci scalar , which can thus be consistently considered the corresponding euler density .",
    "this term , being topological , does not contribute to the equations of motion in two dimensions . however ,",
    "when both these terms , the cosmological constant ( the topological invariant in zero dimensions ) and the ricci scalar ( the topological invariant in two dimensions ) are integrated in three or in four dimensions , i.e. , when they are dimensionally continued to the next odd or even dimensions , they contribute non - trivially to the equations of motion , and indeed in three and four dimensions , yield the standard general relativity .",
    "now , given general relativity in four dimensions , one can add a generalized gauss - bonnet ( i.e. , a generalized euler density ) term , in four dimensions , first discovered by lanczos @xcite , which when integrated in the four dimensional action gives essentially the corresponding euler characteristic , also a topological invariant not contributing to the classical field equations . in turn ,",
    "in five and six dimensions , not only an action with the cosmological constant and the ricci scalar , mentioned above , contribute to the equations of motion , but also one can dimensionally continue the previous generalized gauss - bonnet term in order to have a meaningful extended action , which gives the desired equations of motion of second order . of course , in six dimensions there is a new generalized gauss - bonnet term , which when integrated gives the corresponding euler characteristic , not contributing to the equations of motion .",
    "then , repeating this process of adding a generalized gauss - bonnet term of the previous even dimension to the next two dimensions , odd and then even , one gets the lovelock gravity of that specific dimension .",
    "thus , the lovelock theory can also be considered as a dimensional continuation of the euler characteristics of lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "the theory has , in addition to newton s constant and the cosmological constant , new arbitrary dimensionful parameters , which should be chosen carefully .",
    "we have given a classical motivation for including certain special new terms in the gravitational action in @xmath0 dimensions , but there are also quantum motivations to study the dimensional continuation of the euler characteristics . indeed , in a string theory context , in order to prevent the existence of ghosts in a low energy limit of the theory , one has to add to the @xmath0 dimensional general relativity action all the previous lower dimensional euler characteristics @xcite .",
    "suppose now the world has indeed extra dimensions , and that the whole bulk spacetime obeys lovelock gravity rather than einstein gravity .",
    "thus , in this case , it is important to study generic properties of black holes in the lovelock theory . solutions of spherical black holes in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions for einstein - hilbert action plus a generalized gauss - bonnet term , i.e. , a specially truncated lovelock theory , were found in @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics were often studied in these works . in @xcite , where black hole solutions were also found , no relevant lovelock term was put to zero , rather a special choice was made for all the lovelock coefficients , which depend only on the cosmological constant and the dimension of the spacetime .",
    "all non - topological terms are included in the action , and the theory can thus be called dimensionally continued gravity .",
    "this choice is one among infinite , but it leads to a natural outcome , where the action in even dimensions has a born - infeld form , i.e. , it may be regarded as the gravitational analogue of the born - infeld electrodynamics , and in odd dimensions has a chern - simons form .",
    "also in @xcite , lovelock theory was coupled to maxwell electromagnetism , and the corresponding black hole solutions with electric charge and cosmological constant were found .",
    "now , a natural extension of this prescription was advanced in @xcite , where it was allowed that the topological term plus some non - topological terms , starting from the top , could be put to zero .",
    "for instance , in @xmath7 dimensions in this setting one may work just with the general relativity term and the following generalized gauss - bonnet term , by putting to zero the other higher dimensional euler densities .",
    "for the nonzero terms , the choice of the coefficients of the theory is the same as in @xcite .",
    "this extension has as a special case the dimensionally continued gravity of @xcite . by coupling this extension to maxwell electromagnetism ,",
    "a general class of charged vacuum spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant , including of course the black holes found in @xcite , were exhibited @xcite .",
    "these vacuum solutions yield a natural division of the lovelock theory into two branches , namely @xmath1 ( which includes general relativity , born - infeld type theories , and other generic gravities ) and @xmath2 ( which includes chern - simons type theories ) , where @xmath3 is the parameter that gives the highest power of the curvature in the lagrangian . in the solutions there",
    "appears an additional parameter @xmath8 , with @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that , in addition , the solutions can be subdivided into two families of different characters , one family @xmath5 , comprising solutions of the type found in general relativity , has a black hole character ( meaning that for a correct choice of the parameters , such as mass and charge , the solution is a black hole solution , although , of course , for other choices of parameters it can be an extremal black hole or a naked singularity ) , and the other family @xmath6 , being of a new type not found in general relativity , has a naked singularity character ( meaning there is no possible choice of the parameters that gives a black hole solution , the full vacuum solution is always singular without horizons ) .",
    "of course the solutions also include empty spacetimes .",
    "since in general there is a negative cosmological constant the spacetimes are asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) , or when empty they are ads itself or some form of it .    given that one has a family of spacetimes with either black hole or naked singularity character , it is now important to study matter effects , either static or dynamic ( collapsing or expanding ) , on these solutions",
    ". such a phenomenon could be interesting in the aftermath of a collision between charged particles where the debris formed in the collision can be accreted or excreted in the newly formed charged spacetime .",
    "accretion and excretion processes are usually technically elaborate , so to turn the analysis simpler one can study the case of a thin shell in the background spacetime , be it a black hole or otherwise .",
    "static and dynamic solutions on such backgrounds are then of interest .",
    "however , in lovelock theories , even a thin shell and its dynamics can bring complications .",
    "indeed , in general relativity for instance , to study a thin shell in a given background one has to make a smooth junction from the interior to the exterior spacetime , as was done in @xcite .",
    "now , the junction conditions , in general , depend on the theory one is studying , and for theories with higher powers on the riemann and other tensors this can be nontrivial @xcite .",
    "an elegant and useful approach , that bypasses in a way the junction conditions for a spacetime with a thin shell , uses a hamiltonian formalism for the theory under study .",
    "this approach was developed by hjek and kijowski @xcite for the theory of general relativity with matter in four dimensions , and was subsequently explored by crisstomo and olea in @xmath0 dimensional general relativity coupled to maxwell theory and matter with applications mainly in three spacetime dimensions @xcite .",
    "the method requires that one puts the theory in a hamiltonian form and then one directly integrates the canonical constraints , producing the shell dynamics for the background one wants to study .",
    "the pay off is that , not only one avoids to have to develop covariant junction conditions for each particular theory one is studying , but moreover the full spacetime , comprised of interior , shell , and exterior components , is treated as whole .",
    "this method is particularly well suited for symmetric configurations .",
    "the great power of the formalism was brought up in @xcite where it was applied in pure lovelock gravity to thin shell collapse in the background of the uncharged spacetimes found in @xcite .",
    "now , since the newly formed spacetime , black hole or otherwise , generated from a collision between charged particles , is most probably charged , and for the same reason the collapsing or expanding debris are also charged , it is of interest to study , using the hamiltonian formalism advanced in @xcite , the gravitational dynamics of a charged thin shell in the charged sector of the spacetime solutions , black hole or otherwise , found in @xcite , of lovelock gravity coupled to maxwell electromagnetism . in the usual extra dimension scenarios the electromagnetic and matter fields , being confined to the brane ,",
    "do not probe the extra dimensions , so that an axisymmetric shell , static or collapsing , around a spherically symmetric black hole is an important configuration to study .",
    "however , in order to simplify the analysis we study instead , as a zero order approximation , a spherically symmetric shell around a spherically symmetric black hole ( such a configuration would be quite realistic for charged fields and particles that can probe the extra dimensions ) . of course , within general relativity , a very special case of lovelock gravity , such an analysis should recover the earlier results , obtained through a junction condition formalism @xcite of charged shell dynamics in a charged black hole spacetime @xcite .",
    "all the works just mentioned are classical , and an extension of full lovelock gravity into the quantum domain , or even within a semiclassical approximation , although important , seems beyond reach .    in the present article",
    "we extend the treatment of the classical dynamics of an uncharged thin shell in an uncharged spacetime , black hole or otherwise , with a negative cosmological constant background in lovelock - maxwell theory , given in @xcite , to the classical dynamics of a charged thin shell in a charged spacetime , black hole or otherwise , with a negative cosmological constant background in lovelock - maxwell theory , and among other things , show the power of the hamiltonian method in unifying in a single unit the three sectors of the problem , namely , the gravitational , the electrodynamic and the matter sectors , as well as taking into account automatically the smooth junction of the several regions of spacetime in question , the interior , the exterior and the thin shell in between . in sec .",
    "[ llsection ] the system under study , namely charged vacuum plus charged thin shell , is initially put in an action and lagrangian framework , in both tensor and differential forms languages .",
    "the field content of the action is composed of three sectors , the gravitational , the electrodynamic , and the matter term . in the gravitational action we establish the coupling constants and make the choice of lovelock coefficients , cutting off the lovelock polynomial at the highest possible power of the curvature for which the theory is sensible . in the electrodynamic action we write the maxwell term and add a current term , which describes the current of charged matter in the shell , and precede each term with its coupling constant . in the matter action we define the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid matter source .",
    "we then write the same action in the hamiltonian form in tensorial language .",
    "for each of the above mentioned sectors of the action we define the canonical coordinates and its conjugate momenta , up to surface terms . as the system under study is a system with constraints , we write the constraints and their respective lagrange multipliers for each of the sectors of the action .",
    "next , we obtain the hamiltonian field equations from the hamiltonian action by using spherically symmetry in the action and varying it with respect to the canonical coordinates and momenta , for the evolution equations , and the lagrange multipliers , for the constraint equations . in sec . [ solutions ]",
    "we analyze the vacuum solutions of the derived hamiltonian equations and describe their properties .",
    "afterwards we establish the geometrical framework of the thin shell and its hamiltonian description .",
    "we divide spacetime into three parts , interior spacetime , thin shell , and exterior spacetime , and describe their geometric set - up .",
    "then we specify the matter properties of the thin shell , which we define as being that of a perfect fluid .",
    "we write its energy - momentum tensor and its relevant projections .",
    "we then solve the complete hamiltonian equations around the thin shell .",
    "first , we note that the vacuum solutions yield a natural division of the lovelock theory into two branches , namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the parameter that gives the highest power of the curvature in the lagrangian .",
    "there appears an additional parameter @xmath8 , with @xmath4 , which gives the character of the solutions , namely , the vacuum solutions may have a black hole character @xmath9 or a naked singularity character ( @xmath6 ) . since there is a negative cosmological constant , the spacetimes are asymptotically ads , and ads when empty , or some form of it .",
    "second , the whole integration of the equations from the interior to the exterior vacuum regions through the thin shell is performed , where the smooth junction of the several regions of spacetime in question is automatically taken into account by the integration , showing definitely the efficacy of the method .",
    "the shell s dynamics in the vacuum spacetimes is then derived and the electrodynamic constraint equation recovers the electric charge conservation .",
    "an analysis of the equations of the thin shell is performed by studying two interesting cases , namely a static thin shell in equilibrium and the gravitational collapse of a thin shell ( the study of gravitational expansion is simply the time reversal of gravitational collapse , and so it is not necessary to analyze it in any detail ) . for the static shell",
    "we determine the radii at which the shell is in equilibrium and the pressure necessary to maintain the shell at this radius .",
    "for the gravitational collapse of a thin shell we start studying a simple example of dust matter in an empty interior and then prove cosmic censorship in a general case . more specifically , following the natural division of the lovelock theory into the two branches mentioned above , we study the collapse of a thin shell onto an empty interior without cosmological constant , and give as examples collapse in four and ten dimensions in general relativity , collapse in ten dimensions in born - infeld type theories , and collapse in ten dimensions in general relativity with a single generalized gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we also study gravitational collapse in five dimensions onto an empty interior with a cosmological constant as an example of chern - simons type theories .",
    "plots are drawn for these cases just mentioned , which illustrate the dynamics of the collapse and exhibit the cosmic censorship at work .",
    "this example of collapse of a shell into an empty interior , in a number of theories specified by @xmath0 and @xmath3 , shows that electric charge provides a mechanism for cosmic censorship for all relevant cases , including those which , in the uncharged case , did not conform to it .",
    "then , more generally , for gravitational collapse onto black hole interiors , it is proven that the equations respect the cosmic censorship hypothesis . in sec . [ section4 ] we conclude and draw some physical implications in connection with the extra large dimensions scenario .",
    "we put @xmath10 .",
    "for our purposes of studying charged matter in a @xmath0 dimensional charged background spacetime , the field content is divided into three sectors , the gravitational , the electrodynamic , and the matter sectors .",
    "then , the action @xmath11 can be written as the sum of a gravitational action @xmath12 , an electrodynamic action @xmath13 , and a generic matter field action @xmath14 , which will be specialized later on to be a charged thin shell .",
    "thus , @xmath15    0.2 cm the gravitational action and lagrangian : 0.1 cm the gravitational sector of the action , @xmath12 , depends on which theory one wants to adopt .",
    "general relativity , first formulated in four spacetime dimensions , can be trivially extended to higher @xmath0 spacetime dimensions by changing the action from a four dimensional integral of the cosmological constant term and the ricci scalar , to a @xmath0 dimensional integral of both terms . however , this extension is no longer unique .",
    "another natural extension is given by the lovelock gravity @xcite , in which its action results from demanding that the euler - lagrange equations derived from the corresponding lagrangian yield all tensors @xmath16 symmetric in @xmath17 , occurring concurrently with the metric tensor @xmath18 and its first two derivatives , i. e. , @xmath19 , and divergence free . in four dimensions only the cosmological constant and the ricci scalar yield an action with these properties , which is precisely the einstein - hilbert action . as one goes to higher dimensions new generalized gauss - bonnet terms , topological in nature in the previous dimension , make their appearance .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the lovelock theory can then be considered as a dimensional continuation of the topological euler characteristics of lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "the theory has , in addition to newton s constant and the cosmological constant , new arbitrary dimensionful parameters , which should be chosen carefully .",
    "due to its interest and generality , we work here with lovelock gravity .",
    "the gravitational part @xmath12 in ( [ actiontotal ] ) is then the lovelock action , which turns out to be a polynomial in the curvature tensor , of degree @xmath20 $ ] , where the brackets @xmath20 $ ] represent the integer part of @xmath21 .",
    "this action , and the corresponding lagrangian @xmath22 defined through @xmath23 , can be written as @xmath24}\\alpha_p\\,\\sqrt{-\\mathfrak{g}}\\,2^{-p}\\ ,   \\delta^{\\mu_1\\cdots \\mu_{2p}}_{\\nu_1\\cdots   \\nu_{2p}}\\,r_{\\mu_1 \\mu_2}^{\\nu_1\\nu_2 } \\cdots   r_{\\mu_{2p-1 } \\mu_{2p}}^{\\nu_{2p-1}\\nu_{2p}}\\ , ,   \\label{llactioncomponent form}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is inversely proportional to the newton s constant ( which will be appropriately chosen below ) , @xmath26 stands for the spacetime manifold , @xmath27 is the determinant of the spacetime metric , and @xmath28 are spacetime indices .",
    "the generalized @xmath29 function is antisymmetric in all of the upper indices and all of the lower indices , and @xmath30 is the riemann tensor .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 are arbitrary in general , apart from the first two @xmath32 and @xmath33 . indeed , in the gravitational action ( [ llactioncomponent form ] ) , the first term of the integrand is the cosmological constant @xmath34 and the second term of the integrand is the ricci scalar @xmath35 , i.e. , the terms of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "this shows that general relativity is contained in the lovelock theory as a particular case , namely by putting in the action all the @xmath36 for @xmath37 . for even dimensions , the term @xmath38 in the action ( [ llactioncomponent form ] )",
    "is the euler characteristic of that @xmath0 dimensional manifold and does not contribute to the field equations .",
    "however , although not relevant for the purposes of this paper , the presence of the euler term guarantees the existence of a well defined variational principle for asymptotically locally ads spacetimes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "lovelock gravity , from the way it is constructed , has the same essence as general relativity .",
    "however , the theory is more complicated , it sets extra problems not present in general relativity and yields new interesting features .",
    "for instance , for @xmath39 the fields may evolve in a non - unique manner , such that , given initial values for the fields at @xmath40 , at @xmath41 the equations of motion do not determine those fields completely .",
    "this is due to the presence in the lagrangian of high powers in the first derivative of the metric tensor with respect to time @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of lovelock gravity is that , although its linearized approximation is classically equal to the corresponding linearized approximation in general relativity @xcite , in the full strong gravity regime of the theory , the higher powers of curvature in the lagrangian yield solutions that are different , and such type of solutions in lovelock theory can not be reached through a solution in general relativity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another feature is the fact that , in addition to the constant @xmath25 ( inversely proportional to an appropriate generalization of newton s constant ) and the cosmological constant @xmath34 , there are the @xmath42 $ ] arbitrary dimensionful parameters .",
    "now , for a given dimension and an arbitrary choice of the coefficients @xmath31 , the dynamical evolution can become unpredictable @xcite , thus it is advantageous to restrict these coefficients in order to be able to construct meaningful black hole and other solutions .",
    "an important step in this direction was taken first in @xcite and generalized in @xcite , where the coefficients @xmath31 were chosen so that unique sensible solutions , with well defined perturbations could be found .",
    "one way to meet these requirements is to demand , in a consistent way , that the theory has a unique cosmological constant @xmath34 as shown in @xcite , which leads to the choice @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a length scale of the theory given in terms of the cosmological constant @xmath34 by @xmath45 as seen in the last expression , in this setting the cosmological constant is negative throughout , and so the solutions will be asymptotically ads solutions .",
    "we are then left with a set of theories labeled by an integer @xmath3 , with @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "one should explain better the dependence of the theories on @xmath3 . in @xcite @xmath3",
    "was put equal to its maximum value always , @xmath47 $ ] , i.e. , no pertinent lovelock term is put to zero , and one has the corresponding special choice made in eq .",
    "( [ alphaconstants ] ) . in this case , all non - topological terms , plus the topological non - dynamical term in the even dimensional case , are included in the action , and the theory can thus be called dimensionally continued gravity , since as one goes one dimension up , what was a topological term in the previous dimension , is now a term that contributes dynamically when one continues the dimension . in even dimensions , @xmath48 , this choice leads to a born - infeld gravitational action , the gravitational analogue of the born - infeld electrodynamics , and in odd dimensions , @xmath49 , it leads to a chern - simons gravitational action @xcite .",
    "this dimensionally continued theory @xcite can be naturally extended by canceling higher order terms , from a given integer @xmath3 upwards .",
    "this was done in @xcite .",
    "for instance one can set up a theory in which only the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 appear , thus @xmath52 .",
    "this theory is general relativity .",
    "if one puts @xmath53 one gets general relativity plus the corresponding generalized gauss - bonnet term , and so on , up to the dimensionally continued gravity where @xmath47 $ ] . in brief , for a given dimension @xmath0 , depending on the choice of the integer @xmath3 , one generates different theories , with @xmath3 giving the highest power of the curvature in the lagrangian .",
    "now , the other fundamental constant @xmath25 can be related to a generalized newton s constant @xmath54 , labeled by @xmath3 , with units @xmath55=({\\rm",

    "( [ acceleration3 ] ) , it depends on the radius at which the shell is located .",

    "more specifically , the left plot shows a region limited by two zeros of @xmath304 , the region where a trajectory of a thin shell is possible .",
    "the horizon , given by the larger zero of @xmath374 , is inside the region where @xmath352 , which means that the shell passes smoothly through the horizon .",
    "the shell then suffers a bounce inside the horizon into another universe .",
    "the plot on the right shows a naked singularity character exterior spacetime , which means that there is no zero of @xmath374 , hence no horizon .",
    "there is , however , no collapse to a naked singularity , because the region where @xmath352 is limited by two zeros , the smaller being larger than the constraint radius .",
    "thus the shell bounces between two extreme values of @xmath35 , and so does not collapse at all . in the figure we have shown bouncing solutions only , although as before one could produce totally collapsing solutions . as in the @xmath1 branch",
    ", a general set up for the study of the turning points and the shell s trajectory in a carter - penrose diagram for the causal structure could be performed here , but this will not be done .    0.3 cm _",
    "( ii ) cosmic censorship : _ 0.1 cm    given the experience we have acquired with the above examples , one can now study cosmic censorship directly from eq .",
    "( [ shellequation2 ] ) or ( [ equation3 ] ) .",
    "cosmic censorship holds if no naked singularity forms from gravitational collapse in an initially nonsingular spacetime or if no naked singularity forms from gravitational collapse in a spacetime initially containing a black hole .",
    "we assume @xmath404 and @xmath405 .",
    "there are three such cases in our study : first , both spacetime regions on each side of the collapsing shell have character @xmath5 , and the interior solution is a black hole spacetime ; second , both spacetime regions on each side of the collapsing shell have character @xmath5 , and the interior solution is an empty vacuum spacetime ; and third , both spacetime regions on each side of the collapsing shell have character @xmath6 , and the interior solution is an empty vacuum spacetime . on all these cases cosmic censorship holds . for the first case , that both spacetime regions on each side of the collapsing shell have character @xmath5 , and",
    "the interior solution is a black hole spacetime , given the above dynamic equation one can directly prove that the collapse of a charged shell in such a background never yields a naked singularity spacetime . to start with we have a shell collapsing into an interior black hole spacetime .",
    "this means that the @xmath8 term on the left of ( [ equation3 ] ) is positive ( otherwise the interior would not be that of a black hole spacetime ) . from eq .",
    "( [ shellequation2 ] ) it is known that @xmath406 , because this expression is the right hand side of ( [ shellequation2 ] ) . if then the shell is collapsing onto an existing black hole , and it is such that the result would be a naked singularity , i.e. , the collapsing shell is sufficiently overcharged , then @xmath407 for a certain @xmath394 , and @xmath355 would always be larger than zero ( because in the exterior spacetime there would be no horizon ) .",
    "it is then clear that the term @xmath408 is negative if the shell reaches @xmath394 .",
    "however , as we are working in the asymptotically outside region , then @xmath409 .",
    "this means that the signal of @xmath242 is the same as that of @xmath410 , and so the signal of @xmath411 is the same as that of @xmath412 .",
    "this results in the fact that the left hand side of ( [ equation3 ] ) is positive at the horizon of the inner black hole , defined by @xmath407 , and that the right hand side of the same eq .",
    "( [ equation3 ] ) is negative , which implies a contradiction . for the second case , that both spacetime regions on each side of the collapsing shell have character @xmath5 , and the interior solution is an empty vacuum spacetime , one can treat it as a limiting case of the first case , as the mass of the interior black hole goes to zero , or directly using similar arguments as above , with the result that a collapsing shell , if undercharged forms a black hole , if overcharged has a bounce back from where it came . for the third case , that both spacetime regions on each side of the collapsing shell have character @xmath6 , and the interior solution is an empty vacuum spacetime , one can write eq .",
    "( [ equation3 ] ) as @xmath413 one sees that when the shell approaches @xmath266 , its right hand side approaches zero , whereas the left hand side approaches a finite value .",
    "so there is a bounce and the shell never collapses to a singularity .",
    "these three cases prove the result , and yield cosmic censorship in charged backgrounds in the lovelock theory we are studying coupled to maxwell electromagnetism .",
    "we now briefly comment on the uncharged case @xmath414 .",
    "one can prove that in this particular case , in the @xmath1 branch one has no formation of naked singularities , whereas in the @xmath2 uncharged branch there is formation of naked singularities , so that one can say that electrical charge acts really as a cosmic censor .",
    "thus , a charged shell never develops a naked singularity .",
    "this is rather like having a shell with some angular momentum , a situation which is much harder to study directly in theories with @xmath388 .",
    "nonetheless , the special case of an uncharged collapsing shell in @xmath252 with angular momentum was studied in @xcite , with the result that indeed the angular momentum also prevents the formation of a naked singularity .",
    "there are two main conclusions from this work .",
    "one conclusion is that the hamiltonian formalism is a powerful method to treat in a unified way spacetimes composed of several pieces , such as several vacua and thin shells , in theories much more complicated than general relativity such as the subset of theories derived from lovelock gravity coupled to maxwell electromagnetism we have studied .",
    "the other conclusion is that , when the spacetimes in question have the same character of those spacetimes provided by general relativity @xmath9 , the collapse of the thin shells in the backgrounds , black hole or otherwise , of each different type of lovelock theory is in many ways similar to the collapse in general relativity itself , and when the spacetimes in question have the opposite character @xmath415 , some other new features appear .",
    "this in turn has the following physical implications : if indeed there are extra dimensions with a relative large size , as exposed in the introduction , then the new and the old features , when confronted with experimental data , can provide the signature to the uncovering not only of the actual spacetime dimension @xmath0 , but also of the value of the parameter @xmath3 , i.e. , of which particular lovelock gravity nature picks up at the appropriate scales , whether be it general relativity ( @xmath52 , any @xmath0 ) , born - infeld ( @xmath416 , even @xmath0 ) , chern - simons ( @xmath416 , odd @xmath0 ) , or other generic gravity ( other @xmath3 , any @xmath0 ) . of course , a full quantum treatment , or even a semiclassical approximation ,",
    "would be much more appropriate for this kind of questions , but for lovelock type gravities the technical difficulties are exponentiated easily , and thus it is advisable to start up with a classical analysis , as we did here .",
