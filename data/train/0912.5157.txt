    "the measurement of the fluctuations in the kaon to pion ratio by the na49 collaboration was the first event - by - event analysis in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that this ratio might allow to distinguish events with enhanced strangeness production attributed to the qgp phase @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the excitation function for this observable is available in a wide range of energies : from the na49 collaboration @xcite in pb+pb collisions at the cern sps and from the star collaboration @xcite in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "results from na49 show an enhancement of fluctuations in the kaon to pion multiplicity ratio for low energies which may be a signal of a deconfinement phase transition . on the other hand",
    "there is no such an enhancement for the proton to pion ratio fluctuations .",
    "this proceeding presents the results of a systematic study of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ratio fluctuations ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 means @xmath6 ) based on the hsd transport model @xcite . for more details we refer readers to  @xcite .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations for charged hadron multiplicities also have been studied in the hsd transport approach  @xcite .",
    "let s introduce some notations .",
    "the deviation @xmath7 from the average number @xmath8 of the particle species @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 , while the covariance for species @xmath9 and @xmath11 is : @xmath12 the scaled variance and the correlation coefficient @xmath13^{1/2}}~.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fluctuations of the ratio @xmath14 will be characterized by @xmath15 @xcite , which to the second order in @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be written as : @xmath18^{1/2}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the experimental data for @xmath19 fluctuations are usually presented in terms of the so called dynamical fluctuations @xcite",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath15 is defined by ( [ sigma ] ) , and @xmath21 corresponds to the following mixed events procedure .",
    "one takes a large number of nucleus - nucleus collision events , and measures the numbers of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in each event .",
    "then all @xmath9 and @xmath11 particles from all events are combined into one _",
    "set_. a construction of _ mixed events _ is done like the following : one fixes a random number @xmath24 according to the experimental probability distribution @xmath25 , takes randomly @xmath26 particles ( @xmath9 and/or @xmath11 ) from the _ whole set _ , fixes the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and returns these @xmath26 particles into the _ set_. this is the mixed event number one .",
    "then one constructs event number 2 , number 3 , etc .",
    "note that the number of events is much larger than the number of hadrons , @xmath26 , in any single event .",
    "therefore , the probabilities @xmath27 and @xmath28 to take the @xmath9 and @xmath11 species from the whole _",
    "set _ can be considered as constant values during the event construction .",
    "another consequence of a large number of events is the fact that all @xmath9 and @xmath11 particles in any constructed _ mixed event _ most probably belong to different _ physical events _ of nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "therefore , the correlations between @xmath23 and @xmath22 numbers in a physical event are expected to be destroyed in a mixed event .",
    "this is the main purpose of the mixed events construction .",
    "calculating the @xmath19 fluctuations for mixed events one gets like in @xcite : @xmath29 the mixed event procedure gives the same @xmath15 for @xmath19 fluctuations as in the gce formulation for an ideal boltzmann gas , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath31 in ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "note that non - trivial fluctuations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath32 ) as well as non - zero correlations @xmath33 may exist in the mixed events procedure , but they are canceled out exactly in @xmath34 .",
    "the hsd results as well as statistical model calculations for ratio fluctuations in full acceptance are presented in @xcite a comparison of the sm results for fluctuations in different ensembles with the data looks problematic at present due to the difficulties in implementing the experimental acceptance and centrality selection which , however , can be taken into account in the transport approach . in order to compare the hsd calculations with the measured data ,",
    "the experimental cuts are applied for the simulated set of hsd events . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] the hsd results of @xmath35 for the @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 ratios are shown in comparison with the experimental data by the na49 collaboration at the sps  @xcite and the preliminary data of the star collaboration at rhic @xcite .",
    "the available results of urqmd calculations ( from refs .",
    "@xcite ) are also shown by the dashed lines .    -8pt",
    "-8pt    for the sps energies we use the na49 acceptance tables from ref . @xcite . for the rhic energies we use the following cuts",
    ": in pseudorapidity , @xmath36 , and in transverse momentum , @xmath37 gev / c for kaons and pions and @xmath38 gev / c for protons @xcite .",
    "note , that hsd results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] correspond to the centrality selection as in the experiment : the na49 data correspond to the 3.5% most central collisions selected via veto calorimeter , whereas in the star experiment the 5% most central events with the highest multiplicities in the pseudorapidity range @xmath39 have been selected .",
    "one sees that the urqmd model gives practically a constant @xmath40 , which is by about @xmath41 smaller than the results from hsd at the lowest sps energy .",
    "this difference between the two transport models may be probably attributed to different realizations of the string and resonance dynamics in hsd and urqmd : in urqmd the strings decay first to heavy baryonic and mesonic resonances which only later on decay to ` light ' hadrons such as kaons and pions . in hsd",
    "the strings dominantly decay directly to ` light ' hadrons ( from the pseudoscalar meson octet ) or the vector mesons @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( or the baryon octet and decouplet in case of baryon number @xmath45 ) .",
    "such a ` non - equilibrated ' string dynamics may lead to stronger fluctuations of the @xmath0 ratio .    at the sps energies the hsd simulations lead to negative values of @xmath35 for the proton to pion ratio .",
    "this is in agreement with the na49 data in pb+pb collisions . on the other hand hsd",
    "gives large positive values of @xmath46 at rhic energies which strongly overestimate the preliminary star data for au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath47 only preliminary star data in au+au collisions are available @xcite which demonstrate a qualitative agreement with the hsd results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the hsd results for @xmath47 show a weak energy dependence in both sps and rhic energy regions .",
    "a peculiar feature is , however , a strong ` jump ' between the sps and rhic values , seen in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , in the hsd calculations which is caused by the different acceptances in the sps and rhic measurements .",
    "the influence of the experimental acceptance is clearly seen at 160 a gev where a switch from the na49 to the star acceptance leads to the jump in @xmath47 by 3% - middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . on the other hand , our calculations for pb+pb ( 3.5% central ) and for au+au ( 5% central ) collisions - performed within the na49 acceptance for both cases at 160",
    "a gev - shows a very week sensitivity of @xmath47 on the actual choice of the collision system and centrality  cf . the coincident open circle and triangle at 160 a gev in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the event - by - event multiplicity fluctuations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ratio fluctuations in central au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions from low sps up to top rhic energies have been studied within the hsd transport approach .",
    "it has been found that the hsd model can qualitatively reproduce the measured excitation function for the @xmath0 ratio fluctuations in central au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions from low sps up to top rhic energies .",
    "accounting for the experimental acceptance as well as the centrality selection has a relatively small influence on @xmath35 and does not change the shape of the @xmath35 excitation function .",
    "the hsd results for @xmath46 appear to be close to the na49 data at the sps .",
    "the data for @xmath47 in pb+pb collisions at the sps energies will be available soon and allow for further insight .",
    "a comparison of the hsd results with preliminary star data in au+au collisions at rhic energies are not fully conclusive : @xmath35 from hsd calculations is approximately in agreement with data @xcite for the kaon to proton ratio , but overestimate the experimental results @xcite for the proton to pion ratio .",
    "new data on event - by - event fluctuations in au+au at rhic energies will help to clarify the situation .",
    "this work was supported by the helmholtz international center for fair within the framework of the loewe program ( landesoffensive zur entwicklung wissenschaftlich - konomischer exzellenz ) launched by the state of hesse .",
