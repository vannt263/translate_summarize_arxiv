    "the existence of an easily - accessible feshbach resonance allows the tuning of the interspecies interactions with great accuracy so that the entire bec - bcs crossover with number imbalance may be explored  @xcite .",
    "the _ bcs regime _ involves a small and negative s - wave scattering length , with the fermions forming weakly bound cooper pairs . on the other hand , in the _ bec regime _ , where the scattering length is positive , the particles form tightly bound molecular pairs forming a condensate  @xcite . in between",
    "lies the _ unitary regime _ , characterized by a diverging scattering length ( signifying the appearance of a bound state ) , where particles are strongly interacting .",
    "the divergence of the scattering length implies that the system is universal , in the sense that only a single length scale characterizes it .",
    "much work has been done in an attempt to understand the ground state properties of the imbalanced clouds ; however , despite theoretical advances  @xcite , some problems remain unresolved .",
    "the mit data  @xcite are in good agreement with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite and renormalization group ( rg ) predictions  @xcite , which point to the existence of a _ three - shell _ structure consisting of a superfluid ( sf ) core phase , a partially polarized and a fully - polarized normal ( n ) phase . from these experiments ,",
    "the homogeneous phase diagram has been determined and is in agreement with both the mc and rg results . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of the rice group s experiments  @xcite are are less well understood .",
    "for example , they find that superfluidity does not break down at high polarizations , which is incompatible with the results of the mit experiments and thus also in contradiction to theoretical predictions of a critical polarization , above which superfluidity breaks down . since both the mit phase diagram and the mc and rg predictions were obtained under the assumption that the local density approximation ( lda ) holds , and since the rice experiments involve smaller traps , it is likely that the answer to the riddle lies in the breakdown of lda ( in other words , finite - size effects ) ; indeed , taking as an ansatz a _ two - shell _ structure , the rice data can be recovered by using a n - sf interface tension as a fitting parameter  @xcite .    for our purposes , it is sufficient to say that the mit experiments are well - described by theory , and furnish direct evidence that a n - sf interface exists , separating an unpolarized sf from a partially polarized n.    in this article we argue that the n - sf interface may block the thermal equilibration process between the n and sf phases ; one consequence of this will be to cause a temperature imbalance to appear across the interface .",
    "incorporating such temperature difference in the existing models may provide the key to a better understanding of the experiments .",

    "we find a rich variety of interfacial scattering processes , depending on the energy and momentum of the incident particle .",
    "the implications of this scattering are outlined in section  [ sec_transort ] , where we obtain the thermal conductivity exactly and with a good analytical approximation . finally in section  [ sec_timescales ]",
    "we calculate that for the experiments at lowest temperatures , the typical timescale associated with the equilibration of a temperature difference across the interface , is of order seconds and therefore comparable with the trap lifetime .",
    "fermion mixtures in the bec - bcs crossover are the subject of a very active research field .",
    "although some theoretical models give accurate results for the bec and/or bcs regimes , no model yet allows an analytical , quantitative description across the entire crossover . in the following , we use the",
    "so - called _ one - channel model _ at zero temperature ; this is a straightforward generalization of the bcs model to arbitrarily strong coupling and is widely used in the literature , as it is known to embody most qualitative features of the bec - bcs crossover for the currently experimentally relevant feshbach resonances .",

    "this can be understood as follows . for low enough temperature i.e.  @xmath191 , only incident particles ( and holes ) with energies slightly above the threshold @xmath192 can contribute to the heat conductivity ; they have , however , a very low statistical weight : @xmath193 it is this weight factor which also appears in expression  .",
    "the question now is : what will happen to this exponential decay if we tune the interactions from the bcs to the unitary regime ? in order to answer this , we have numerically calculated the ratio of @xmath194 to the conductivity in the n phase @xmath195 , and show this in fig .",

    "the reason for this good agreement is that the threshold line @xmath200 of the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] is unaffected by changing the scattering regime .",
    "furthermore , relation   which describes the transmission coefficient slightly above the threshold line guarantees that @xmath171 displays the same behavior in regimes v  and  vi .    as argued before , the main effect of varying @xmath201 from large and negative ( deep bcs ) to zero ( unitarity ) , is to shift the curves @xmath115-@xmath116 in diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] .",
    "both the strong exponential decay in @xmath202 and the square root dependence of @xmath171 on @xmath203 are unaffected by the variation of @xmath201 and the introduction of the hartree potentials , hence the very similar behavior of @xmath197 for all scattering regimes under study . on the other hand ,",
    "what is different between the scattering regimes is the value of @xmath1 ; it is small in the sense that @xmath204 in the bcs limit and is comparable with @xmath205 at unitarity .",
    "the introduction of the hartree potentials has two implications on the heat resistivity .",
    "first of all , the scattering diagram will change by horizontal shifts of lines @xmath115-@xmath116 ; as argued before , this does not affect the steep exponential decay of resistivity .",
    "secondly , the coexistence condition will change , that is , the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath93 will change .",
    "this , on the other hand may strongly affect the exponential decay as is seen from eq .  .",
    "at unitarity , the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath93 is known from monte carlo ( mc )  @xcite simulations and a superfluid local density approximation ( slda )  @xcite . from these",
    "we adapt the values @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208  @xcite and finally @xmath209  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig3bis ] , we compare the andreev approximation with values of the one - channel model ( full line ) and of the mc and slda results ( dashed line ) .",
    "we see that the one - channel model predicts the sharp decrease of @xmath181 to be at higher temperatures than the mc and slda results .",
    "we find that the interface conductivity at the lowest experimental temperatures is very low in the sense that the resulting characteristic equilibration time is of order of seconds i.e. the trap lifetime .",
    "we explain now how we estimate the characteristic equilibration time @xmath210 .",
    "consider again a temperature bias @xmath173 across the interface .",
    "we are interested in the resulting total heat flux @xmath211 , induced by the excess heat @xmath212 in the n phase . by definition ,",
    "the heat flux @xmath213 is the amount of heat transferred per unit time per unit surface area .",
    "one can therefore estimate @xmath210 by the relation @xmath214 with @xmath215 the interface area .",
    "moreover , at position @xmath216 in the degenerate n phase @xmath76 , one has @xmath217 $ ] with @xmath218 the particle density and @xmath7  @xcite . combining this with @xmath219",
    ", one finds @xmath220 assume now an isotropic trap of @xmath221 particles at polarization @xmath222 with radial trapping frequency @xmath223hz such that the local density approximation is valid  @xcite . for this configuration",
    ", we calculate that the characteristic time of relaxation @xmath210 is of order seconds when @xmath224 .",
    "this means that according to our estimates , the relaxation time is of the order of the lifetime of the system at the lowest attainable experimental temperature @xmath225 such that in these experiments , the n and sf phases may not be equilibrated .",
    "at least two interesting experimental consequences of the low thermal conductivity for ultracold gases are different to what is the case for a sc .",
    "first of all , in a superconductor , the heat conductivity has a lattice component which dominates the electron component at low temperatures ; the lack of such a component in the system under study makes the decrease of the conductivity more significant  @xcite .",
    "secondly , at very low temperatures , a n - sf temperature gradient will entail a pressure difference @xmath226 across the interface , and therefore the physical movement of the interface ; this is impossible for normal - superconductor junctions .",
    "taking @xmath227 and an infinite thermal resistivity , one finds  @xcite : @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the @xmath230 pressure of species @xmath76 .",
    "depending on the time scales involved , mechanical equilibrium might be reached before thermal equilibrium .",
    "the step function model for the gap ( see eq .  ) is adequate for tackling the problem at hand , that is for estimating the heat conductivity across the interface .",
    "first of all , this model should gives qualitatively correct results as long as the quasiparticle wavelengths are of the same order or less as the length over which the gap varies .",
    "indeed , this is clearly valid in the bcs limit , when the healing length for the gap , further denoted as @xmath231 , is of order @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "moreover , near unitarity , the step - function model is also justified since the length of variation of the gap is smaller than the quasiparticle wavelength  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the step function of eq",
    ".   serves as a good approximation for all regimes under consideration .",
    "second , the step - model for the gap is justified whenever the interface width must be small as compared to the variation length of the trapping potential .",
    "this is also realized in experiments .",
    "we argue now that , even if we would take into account the exact interface profile , our results would hardly be affected . by solving the bogoliubov - de - gennes equations in a self - consistent manner , the interface profile for the gap could be determined  @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the concomitant interface width is of order @xmath234 . as was shown in ref .",
    ", such smooth interface gives rise to a zero transmission coefficients for particles with energy below the gap , and above the gap , smaller transmission coefficients than predicted by our step - function model .",
    "this simply means that particles incoming to the interface with energy below the gap can not cross over to the superfluid phase and therefore they can not carry energy across the interface . hence our conclusions of a blocking of energy transport across the interface remains valid , independent of the interface width .",
    "note also that , due to the decreased transmission coefficient above the gap , the heat conductivity will be even smaller than predicted here .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn at finite temperatures : particles with energy below the gap can not penetrate the superfluid and the conclusions of ref .",
    "concerning the transmission coefficients will still be valid .",
    "indeed , since it is known that the interface width increases with temperature as it varies between @xmath235 and @xmath236 near @xmath237  @xcite , @xmath231 is certainly of the order of @xmath238 at the experimentally relevant temperatures , that is below @xmath239 .",
    "this can be seen in refs .   and   where the self - consistent calculations were performed for various temperatures and even for the strong coupling regime  @xcite .    in our model",
    ", we do not take into account the temperature dependence of the gap .",
    "however , this is well justified as the gap @xmath240 depends very weakly on temperature at low @xmath2 . in the bcs limit",
    "it is well - known that @xmath240 goes as @xmath241 ( see for example in ref .  ) .",
    "moreover , this weak variation is also present in the strong coupling limit  @xcite and can be understood within the single - channel model from the appearance of the factor @xmath242 in the finite - temperature gap equation .",
    "we have studied the effects of a n - sf interface in experiments on trapped imbalanced fermion gases .",
    "we clarify the nature of the possible processes that may occur when a particle is incident onto the interface .",
    "such particles will be thermally excited at any finite temperature , and act as carriers of energy , thus eventually causing thermal equilibration between the n and sf phases .",
    "we find that reflection ( both andreev and normal , or specular ) of low energy particles off the interface in experiments on trapped imbalanced fermion gases causes a suppression of energy transport from one phase to the other . at low enough temperatures ( comparable to the currently accessible temperatures in experiments ) , this suppression grows exponentially with decreasing temperature .",
    "this , in turn , delays thermal equilibration of the system , which may result in a temperature difference between the n and the sf .",
    "our estimates of the timescales for this equilibration are in the seconds , which indicates that this effect is experimentally relevant .",
    "the incorporation of this temperature difference may allow current models to finally resolve the difficulties in explaining the experiments .",
