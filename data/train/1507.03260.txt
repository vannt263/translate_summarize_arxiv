    "excitability is a dynamical feature shared by nonlinear systems that lie in vicinity of bifurcation underlying transition from stationary state toward the sustained periodic activity @xcite .",
    "study of models where stochastic excitable dynamics is crucial for shaping local or collective behavior is a rapidly developing field , gaining relevance in terms of theory as well as for offering qualitative insights into a variety of biological @xcite and inorganic systems @xcite .",
    "excitability is manifested in the existence of a narrow range of stimuli magnitudes where marginally different perturbations may cause the system to generate two qualitatively distinct types of responses .",
    "while smaller perturbations give rise to small - amplitude ( linear ) responses , the slightly larger perturbations may elicit pulse - like , large - amplitude excitation loops .",
    "the latter are comprised of activation and relaxation stage , whereby the spike profile remains independent on the form of applied perturbation .",
    "if one interprets perturbation in terms of setting the particular initial conditions , then the excitability feature is reflected in the point that the system shows strong sensitivity to initial conditions within a small domain of relevant values .",
    "consequently , behavior of excitable systems is heavily susceptible to noise @xcite , whose influence may at least in part be understood as excitability amplification .",
    "given the strong likelihood of encountering systems which are influenced by combined action of variations in the environment and the fluctuations of the internal parameters , it is justified to analyze models where different sources of noise affect the dynamics of multiple variables .",
    "this point , together with the fact that the existence of pulse - like excitations requires a flow with dimension no less than two @xcite , suggests that the system with two variables , each subjected to stochastic perturbation , may be considered a paradigmatic setup .",
    "for example , two sharply separated characteristic time scales and two sources of noise acting independently on the fast and the slow variable are relevant ingredients for the description of a typical neuron @xcite or laser dynamics @xcite . for neurons , stochastic term affecting",
    "the fast variable may account for synaptic noise due to random arrival of spikes from a large number of afferents , whereas the stochastic component in the slow variable dynamics may be seen as internal noise , associated to thermal fluctuations in the opening of the ion - gating channels .",
    "consistent with this , we refer to stochastic term added to the dynamics of the fast ( slow ) variable as external ( internal ) noise .    from the theoretical viewpoint , a comprehensive insight into",
    "the noise - driven activation process is fundamental for understanding excitability .",
    "the problem we focus on concerns the activation process in a single or two coupled excitable fitzhugh - nagumo ( @xmath0 ) elements driven by two independent sources of noise .",
    "the main reason for considering the @xmath0 model lies in its generic character , viz .",
    "the fact that it is canonical for class ii excitable systems , which involve an almost continuous transition between the small- and the large - amplitude excitations . for conceptual reasons and in view of potential applications , only the spiking responses are relevant and of interest to us .",
    "it follows that the formulation of activation event has to be adapted to class ii excitable systems , such that it satisfies two criteria : @xmath1 it should warrant a clear - cut distinction of the spiking response from the small - amplitude excitation and @xmath2 it should allow an immediate generalization from the case of a single unit to that of two interacting units . we stress that in order to meet both criteria , it is crucial to introduce an appropriate terminating boundary set for the activation problem , as demonstrated in the paper .",
    "note that the term activation is inherited from , but it is not used in the same sense as in a typical escape problem @xcite . to explain the differences ,",
    "one first invokes a general remark that for excitable systems , two possible types of response derive from the proximity to bifurcation rather than the bistable dynamics , so that the threshold - like behavior is not associated to a genuine separatrix ( saddle structure ) , but rests on the coaction of nonlinearity and the sharp separation between the system s characteristic time scales .",
    "thus , resolving the origin and character of threshold - like behavior for excitable elements may be linked to an unstable fixed point or , as in case of a @xmath0 unit , to a quasi - separatrix ( `` ghost separatrix '' ) @xcite .",
    "this is apparently different from the typical escape problem scenario .",
    "another important point is that we tie the activation exclusively to spiking response , so that the event where the phase point reaches the quasi - separatrix _ per se _ is insufficient to count as activation . in other words ,",
    "crossing the quasi - separatrix does not present a discriminative condition between the small- and the large - amplitude excitations .",
    "this is why we introduce novel terminating boundary conditions , rather than just consider an extension of the escape problem to excitable systems @xcite .",
    "one should also point out that our approach is conceptually different from the earlier work concerning noisy excitable neurons @xcite , where the terminating boundary does not constitute a set , but rather a unique boundary point , introduced as an arbitrary threshold independent on the structure of phase space .",
    "we analyze the activation problem from two angles , one by determining the most probable activation paths ( @xmath3s ) , and the other by examining the statistical features of the activation process .",
    "an important result consists in determining the @xmath3s for a single and two coupled units under different ratios of external vs internal noise @xmath4 . in case of two units , the topology of the obtained trajectories is shown to qualitatively depend on the form of coupling . the statistics of a single- and two - unit activation process is characterized by examining how the time - to - first - pulse ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 averaged over different stochastic realizations and the associated coefficient of variation @xmath7 depend on noise . both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are found to display universal behavior for all considered setups , whereby the transition between two of the observed @xmath6 regimes is associated to the fact that a unit undergoes stochastic bifurcation induced by @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for two units , the form of coupling",
    "is shown to have a nontrivial effect on correlation of the individual mean @xmath5s , which we relate to synchronization properties of the time series for the given parameter set .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the details of the model , focusing on the threshold - like behavior of a single unit and the results of bifurcation analysis for the coupled units .",
    "section [ mpap ] concerns the case of a single unit subjected to external and internal noise .",
    "having laid out the details of the method used to determine the @xmath3s , cf .",
    "subsection [ method ] , we examine how the topological features of the @xmath3s depend on the pertaining noise intensities . apart from relating the properties of @xmath8 dependence to the onset of stochastic bifurcation from the stochastically stable fixed point to the stochastically stable limit cycle , we also introduce an approximation to explicitly demonstrate that @xmath10 and @xmath11 make substantially different impact on the mean @xmath5s .",
    "section [ twounits ] contains the results for two units interacting via the linear or nonlinear couplings .",
    "it is analyzed how the different form of coupling affects the profile of the respective @xmath3s , the stochastic bifurcation as well as the correlation of single unit mean @xmath5s .",
    "section [ conc ] provides a summary of the main results .",
    "as a paradigm for excitable systems , we consider the @xmath0 model , so that the dynamics of a single unit is given by @xmath12dt+\\sqrt{2d_1}dw_1\\nonumber\\\\ dy&=f_y(x , y)=\\epsilon ( x+b)dt+\\sqrt{2d_2}dw_2 .",
    "\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the model is canonical for type ii excitability class , meaning that the equilibrium lies in vicinity of the direct supercritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "the latter is controlled by the excitability parameter @xmath13 , whereby the critical value is @xmath14 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the system possesses a unique stable equilibrium @xmath16 , whereas for @xmath17 the oscillatory state sets in .",
    "given the symmetry of the system , the analysis may be confined to case @xmath18 without loss of generality .",
    "the unit in subcritical state displays excitable behavior if @xmath13 is kept close to bifurcation threshold . in this paper , we fix @xmath19 .    the other important ingredient of the model is the sharp separation between the characteristic time scales of the activator and the recovery variable .",
    "the fast - slow dynamics is facilitated by setting @xmath20 to a small value ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "so far , @xmath0 model has been applied in describing the dynamics of electrochemical reactions @xcite and cardiac cells @xcite , but is best known for its role in the field of neuroscience @xcite . in the latter context",
    ", the fast variable may be viewed as analogous to the neuron membrane potential , whereas the action of the slow variable may qualitatively be compared to that of @xmath22 ion - gating channels @xcite . regarding the impact of random perturbations ,",
    "we are interested into how the activation of units is shaped by two independent sources of noise . in",
    ", the stochastic effects are represented by the wiener processes whose increments satisfy @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the dynamics of an excitable unit may be summarized as follows . in absence of perturbation ,",
    "the selected parameter values are such that the system lies at equilibrium .",
    "kicked by the perturbation , the unit may either display a small amplitude response , whereby the phase point rapidly decays back to equilibrium , or may exhibit a large excursion , settling to equilibrium only after the phase point has traversed the orbit corresponding to a complete oscillation cycle .",
    "for the proper statement of our problem , it is important to first consider the geometric interpretation of the unit s dynamics .",
    "two particular issues are addressed , one related to the existence and the structure of the boundary between the initial conditions resulting in small- or large - amplitude responses , whereas the other concerns the distinction between the roles of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in triggering the pulse emission .",
    "regarding the first point , we summarize the results on the deterministic ( noiseless ) version of the system obtained by the method of phase plane analysis , which rests on the singular perturbation theory . in the limit @xmath26 ,",
    "turns into a one - dimensional system @xmath27 under the constraint @xmath28 , meaning that @xmath29 may be viewed as a fixed parameter . for small but finite @xmath20",
    ", @xmath30 quickly relaxes to the value given by @xmath31 , the condition outlining the curve referred to as the @xmath30 ( cubic ) nullcline or the slow manifold , see fig .",
    "the @xmath30 nullcline is comprised of three branches , whose stability features derive from the singular limit @xmath26 . while the refractory @xmath32 and the spiking branch @xmath33 may then be regarded as attractors , the middle branch is unstable and is a part of separatrix between the attractive branches .",
    "the key point is that for small but finite @xmath20 , the structure of the boundary and the related threshold behavior is mostly inherited from the singular limit .",
    "the distinction is that finite @xmath20 induces foliation of the boundary around the maximum of the @xmath30-nullcline .",
    "what has explicitly been shown by the so - called `` blow - up method '' @xcite , is that the boundary between the initial conditions leading to @xmath33 or @xmath32 is not given by a single line , but rather by a thin layer made up of an infinite family of canard - like trajectories of system .",
    "the latter further implies that the boundary constitutes an invariant set .",
    "boundary layer may still be perceived as a single line , a kind of `` ghost separatrix '' @xcite , because at distances @xmath34 from the fold point @xmath35 , all the constituent trajectories become virtually indistinguishable .    as for the qualitative interpretation of the effects of noise ,",
    "it is evident that the noise term added to the slow - variable dynamics may shift the position of the @xmath29-nullcline . in other words ,",
    "internal noise is capable of translating the fixed point from the stable refractory to the unstable ( middle ) branch of the @xmath36 nullcline , which temporarily switches the system from excitable to oscillatory state .",
    "while the impact of @xmath11 can be understood by geometric analysis , there is no analogous interpretation in case of @xmath10 .      in case of a pair of coupled units , we consider two distinct setups , one where the units interact via the symmetrical linear couplings , and the other involving couplings given by the nonlinear threshold - like function .",
    "the dynamics of a couple of @xmath0 units interacting via linear couplings is given by @xmath37dt+\\sqrt{2d_1}dw_1^i+c[x_i - x_j]dt \\nonumber\\\\ dy_i&=\\epsilon ( x_i+b)dt+\\sqrt{2d_2}dw_2^i ,   \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 specify the individual units .",
    "the random perturbations are such that the terms acting on different elements are supposed to be uncorrelated @xmath39 . regarding the system parameters ,",
    "note that the units are assumed to be identical ( same @xmath13 and @xmath20 ) , while the symmetrical couplings are characterized by the coupling strength @xmath40 . to see how the unit s excitability feature is modified in presence of interaction",
    ", we make a brief summary of the results of the bifurcation analysis carried out on the noise - free version of the system .",
    "the first remark is that the equilibrium is located at @xmath41 , whereby its stability is determined by the two pairs of complex conjugate characteristic exponents which satisfy @xmath42/2 $ ] and @xmath43/2 $ ] .",
    "given that the single unit parameters are kept fixed , the local stability of equilibrium is changed under variation of the coupling strength . in particular",
    ", it may be demonstrated that the system undergoes a direct supercritical hopf bifurcation at the critical value @xmath44 . at this point ,",
    "the stability of equilibrium is lost and the units are no longer in the excitable regime .",
    "however , we stress that the complete picture on the system dynamics can not be gained from the local bifurcation analysis alone , because even before the excitability feature is lost ( for @xmath45 ) , it is modified due to a global fold - cycle bifurcation which occurs at @xmath46 . thus , under increasing @xmath40 the system exhibits three types of characteristic behavior : @xmath1 the `` proper '' excitable regime for @xmath47 , @xmath2 the regime of `` generalized excitability '' for @xmath48 and @xmath49 the oscillatory state at @xmath50 .",
    "the case @xmath2 involves coexistence between the fixed point and the large limit cycle , whose basins of attraction are separated by the stable manifold of the saddle cycle . in strict terms ,",
    "such a scenario does not conform to izhikevich s definition of excitability , because instead of relaxing to equilibrium after the large excursion , the system displays continuous oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , some authors consider such a behavior as excitable or excitable - like , and one should also note that the oscillation orbit may still pass quite close to equilibrium , depending on the position , size and the manifold structure of the saddle cycle . note that above @xmath51 , the large limit cycle created in the global event survives as the only attractor , because the incipient cycle born via hopf bifurcation grows only until colliding with the preexisting saddle - cycle , such that the two get annihilated in the inverse fold - cycle bifurcation .",
    "in other words , the properties of the limit cycle attractor both below and above @xmath51 are determined by the global bifurcation .",
    "having summarized the results of the bifurcation analysis for the setup involving two units coupled via linear function , we turn to the scenario where the units subjected to external and internal noise interact in a nonlinear fashion .",
    "the dynamics of the units then obeys @xmath37dt+\\sqrt{2d_1}dw_1^i+c\\arctan(x_j+b)dt \\nonumber\\\\ dy_i&=\\epsilon ( x_i+b)dt+\\sqrt{2d_2}dw_2^i ,   \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interaction terms have a form of a threshold - like function , whose argument is defined relative to the corresponding unit s equilibrium @xmath52 .",
    "this way , the impact of the state @xmath53 is felt stronger if it lies further away from the equilibrium .",
    "the stability of equilibrium is determined by the four roots of the characteristic equation , which appear as two pairs of complex conjugates @xmath54/2 $ ] , @xmath55/2 $ ] .",
    "again , it may be shown that the system undergoes a direct supercritical hopf bifurcation at @xmath56 .",
    "note that we confine the analysis to the case @xmath57 .",
    "unlike the setup based on the linear coupling , here one does not encounter the global bifurcation controlled by @xmath40 . in other words , the equilibrium is stable and the units are in excitable regime for @xmath58 , whereas the system is in oscillatory state for @xmath59 .",
    "in the following subsection we introduce the numerical method applied to determine the @xmath3s .",
    "the method is illustrated in case of a single @xmath0 unit , but it can readily carry over to the process of first pulse emission for two interacting units . in subsections",
    "[ examples ] and [ twopaths ] , the topological features of the pertaining trajectories will be analyzed in reference to stochastic bifurcation , viz . for noise intensities substantially below , near or above the critical domain of @xmath60 values .",
    "while the main focus lies with the @xmath3s explicitly obtained from stochastic simulations , the extended discussion will also concern the trajectories generated as solutions of the effective hamiltonian equations under boundary conditions relevant for the process of first pulse emission .",
    "we stress that the use of such equations is distinct from the standard hamiltonian approach which yields optimal trajectories in a typical escape problem , or the generalization of an escape problem to an excitable @xmath0 unit . in order to set up the discussion carried out in subsections [ examples ] and [ twopaths ] , the following subsection addresses the precise role of these effective equations and the ensuing trajectories .",
    "the problem of obtaining the @xmath3s for excitable units in general comprises two issues .",
    "one issue concerns how the terminating boundary conditions are specified , whereas the other relates to the particular details of the method .",
    "a common ingredient in previous approaches to analysis of activation process in excitable units has been to draw an analogy to motion of a particle in a one - dimensional potential perturbed by noise .",
    "reduction to a one - dimensional problem naturally utilizes the decomposition of the system dynamics to fast and slow motions .",
    "though such approximate methods are not intended to trace the unit s most likely activation paths , the use of fokker - planck formalism still allows one to gain insight into certain statistical features of the activation process , including the mean activation time and its variance @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an inherent drawback consists in the lack of ability to account for the simultaneous influence of perturbations added to both the slow and the fast component . in conceptual terms , the key problem lies in the fashion by which the escape from the stationary state is precisely defined . in particular , instead of associating the terminating boundary to the structure of the system s phase space ,",
    "the activation event is considered as a crossing of a predefined threshold , typically coinciding with the fold point at the minimum of the slow manifold .",
    "compared to such methods , the approach we apply is preferred because @xmath1 it introduces a unique definition of the activation path consistent with the structure of the phase space , @xmath2 one may consider the coaction of random perturbations added to both the fast and the slow subsystem , and @xmath49 , one is able to explicitly determine the @xmath3s around which the different stochastic realizations are clustered .    before proceeding to the details of the numerical method implemented for calculation of the @xmath3s ,",
    "let us specify the boundary conditions relevant for the problem of first pulse emission in case of an excitable @xmath0 unit .",
    "in particular , for the noise - driven system , we consider the stochastic fluctuation paths in configuration space @xmath61 that emanate from the deterministic fixed point @xmath16 and terminate at the spiking branch of the cubic ( @xmath62 ) nullcline . given selection of the terminating boundary set derives from the fact that the spiking branch of the cubic nullcline defines the spike profile for the deterministic limit cycle in the superthreshold regime @xmath63 , while the analogous point holds for the noise - induced oscillations in the excitable regime @xmath64 .",
    "in these terms , it has been verified that the profiles of spikes for an arbitrary combination of relevant @xmath60 values can be approximated with sufficient accuracy by the orbit corresponding to the deterministic limit cycle characterizing the supercritical state .",
    "note that the terminating boundary set we introduce is distinct from the one in @xcite , where a conceptually distinct problem has been considered .",
    "in particular , the aim in that paper has been to extend the standard escape problem to the case of an excitable @xmath0 unit , which has been achieved by fixing the `` ghost separatrix '' as the terminating boundary set .",
    "the advantage of the boundary conditions we have adopted is that they can readily be generalized to the case of two interacting excitable units . in another paper",
    ", we shall further demonstrate that the relevance of a proper problem formulation which warrants that the small - amplitude response and the spiking response are clearly distinguished , as well as the related selection of the appropriate terminating boundary conditions , is even more pronounced when analyzing the noise - driven first pulse emission process for an assembly of excitable units .",
    "the details of the numerical method applied to determine the @xmath3s are as follows .",
    "for the given @xmath60 , we consider an ensemble of fluctuation paths @xmath65 which start from the deterministic fixed point @xmath66 at moment @xmath67 and satisfy the above stated terminating boundary conditions .",
    "the terminating time @xmath68 , as well as the associated coordinates @xmath69 are left unspecified . for the described ensemble",
    ", we study the statistics of the @xmath65 position of trajectories as a function of time @xmath70 preceding the arrival to the terminating boundary set . in general",
    ", the idea is to sample the different stochastic realizations of activation trajectories in order to determine histograms of the path history reaching the terminating boundary set .",
    "naturally , the recorded trajectories are characterized by the different @xmath68 times .",
    "thus , the proper approach to characterize the statistics of the paths in configuration space is to consider the prehistory probability density @xcite , which concerns the distribution of paths ending at the specified boundary set . to obtain the former",
    ", one effectively sets the time when each stochastic realization terminates to @xmath71 , such that the behavior of the process during the initiation of the pulse is observed by looking backward in time .",
    "this approach has been introduced in @xcite , and has been applied a number of times since @xcite . the prehistory probability distribution is defined as @xmath72 , \\nonumber \\\\ & t_i < t <",
    "t_f , x < x_b(t_f),y < y_b(t_f ) . \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the most probable path for the first pulse emission process is determined by collecting the points @xmath73 which correspond to the maximum of @xmath74 at any given moment @xmath75 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath3 for the given @xmath60 by definition coincides with the peak of @xmath76 as a function of time . in practice , the numerical method used to determine the prehistory probability density has involved dividing the @xmath61 phase space into a grid of @xmath77 by @xmath77 cells of length @xmath78 and width @xmath79 . throughout the paper , the numerical integration of the appropriate set of stochastic equations",
    "is carried out by the heun algorithm with the time step @xmath80 , whereas the averaging is performed over an ensemble of @xmath81 different stochastic realizations of the first pulse emission process .    in order to provide qualitative guidelines for an extended discussion ,",
    "the @xmath3s determined via the above described method for different setups and the different domains of noise intensities will be compared to trajectories obtained by integrating the set of effective hamiltonian equations under boundary conditions relevant for the problem of first pulse emission .",
    "one recalls that in case of a typical escape problem , the hamiltonian theory formulated in the extended variable - momentum state space may be used to explicitly obtain the optimal trajectories which coincide with the @xmath3 , whereby such trajectories are determined by the minimum of action , introduced as an effective cost function . in @xcite ,",
    "such an approach has been implemented for an extension of the escape problem to an excitable @xmath0 unit , having considered the ghost separatrix as the terminating boundary .",
    "due to fundamentally different terminating boundary conditions , one can not apply the hamiltonian theory _",
    "per se _ for the problem of first pulse emission , as we explain in more detail further below .",
    "therefore , our approach can not be interpreted in the genuine context of or be referred to as an extension of the hamiltonian theory .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian system we consider should be interpreted as a set of effective equations integrated for relevant boundary conditions , whereby a particular trajectory is singled out according to a certain predefined recipe .",
    "our current goal is not to provide a systematic theory , but only to point out to striking similarity between the numerically obtained @xmath3s for the process of first pulse emission and the trajectories generated by the set of effective hamiltonian equations .",
    "this can be considered a preliminary stage of a study which may ultimately lead to derivation of an appropriate theory for the process of first pulse emission , whose basis would take into account certain aspects of the standard hamiltonian formalism .    in the remainder of this subsection",
    ", we briefly consider the main elements of the hamiltonian approach , whose detailed description may be found in @xcite , and clarify the differences emerging in case of the first pulse emission process . within the hamiltonian formalism , the optimal trajectories for a noise - driven escape process are obtained by variation - like approach which minimizes the appropriately defined `` cost functional '' @xmath82 along the set of possible activation trajectories @xmath83 between the two fixed boundaries . in particular ,",
    "the probability for noise to induce the @xmath84 transition is given by @xmath85d\\{\\mathcal{j}\\}$ ] , such that @xmath86 denotes integration along all the paths @xmath87 connecting @xmath88 and @xmath89 . each path is weighted by the probability @xmath90\\propto\\exp[\\frac{-s(x_1,\\dots , x_n)}{d}]$ ] , where @xmath91 is the cost function for the particular path .",
    "when @xmath92 is small , the largest contribution to @xmath93 comes from the path with the minimal cost function @xmath94 . in other words ,",
    "small noise rarely gives rise to transition events , but once they occur , all the other orbits are suppressed in favor of the one corresponding to the minimal cost function .",
    "the transition probability then takes the asymptotic form @xmath95,x_1\\equiv x_i , x_n\\equiv x_f , \\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereby the prefactor @xmath96 is associated to `` degeneracy '' of the minimum , or rather the number of trajectories close to the one given by @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the form of @xmath98 is selected so to reflect on one hand the impact of noise , whereas on the other hand to explicitly incorporate the constraints between the variables and the stochastic terms which derive from the equations of motion .",
    "the necessary conditions for the minimum of such a constraint problem can then be treated by the lagrange multiplier technique .",
    "ultimately , one arrives at a set of equations that may be interpreted as a hamiltonian system , where the lagrange multiplier @xmath99 enact the momenta conjugate to the system variables . in particular , for system , the corresponding hamiltonian set including the generalized momenta is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the components of the momentum , while @xmath103 and @xmath104 represent the scaled noise intensities . by the latter notation , @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "are conveniently expressed in terms of a single amplitude @xmath92 ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "system has the wentzel - freidlin hamiltonian @xmath107 , whereas the trajectories connecting the initial state @xmath108 and final state @xmath109 are characterized by the action @xmath110 . at variance with system ,",
    "the fixed point of the system , @xmath111 , is unstable for @xmath112 , which is corroborated by the positive real part of the characteristic exponents @xmath113 .",
    "conceptually , the hamiltonian formalism is typically applied to escape problems , where the stable equilibrium coexists with a certain saddle state , most often the saddle cycle @xcite .",
    "the aim is then to obtain the heteroclinic trajectory in the extended space , which emanates from the unstable manifold of the fixed point at @xmath114 and reaches the stable manifold of the saddle cycle asymptotically at @xmath115 , as well as tangentially ( @xmath116 ) for @xmath117 . in principle , depending on @xmath118 , the dynamics in the extended space may also support the trajectories that do not settle at , but run across the cycle , as well as the trajectories that are repelled by the cycle , thus being reflected back to initial state . in @xcite , an extension of the escape problem to a single @xmath0 unit has been considered by utilizing the threshold - like behavior to construct the `` ghost '' manifold ( a separatrix in the asymptotic limit @xmath119 ) , which plays the role of a saddle structure .",
    "for such a scenario , the hamiltonian approach yields the optimal trajectory connecting the unstable manifold of the fixed point to the stable manifold of the ghost separatrix .",
    "compared to this , the problem of first pulse emission is fundamentally different because one should look for trajectories that cross the ghost separatrix , viz . leave the basin of attraction of the fixed point . while the action surface in vicinity of the basin boundary should have one clearly defined global minimum , the physical picture near the spiking branch of the @xmath30-nullcline typically involves multiple local minima of the action surface .",
    "a deeper theoretical analysis of these issues is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "the point we make here is as follows .",
    "let us consider the trajectories that correspond to local minima of the action surface and adopt as a rule to select the solution that has the smallest momentum at the terminating boundary .",
    "then , for different system configurations , the comparison of the @xmath3s numerically obtained from an ensemble of stochastic realizations reveals significant similarity to the respective trajectories generated by the set of effective hamiltonian equations .    in terms of numerical treatment",
    ", obtaining the relevant trajectories from the effective system comprises a boundary value problem . at the initial moment @xmath67 ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath120 lying on the unstable manifold of the fixed point are specified according to the method provided in @xcite , which connects the coordinates in the configuration space with the components of the momentum . by this method , it follows that the initial coordinates in the extended space can be parameterized via a single angular variable @xmath121 .",
    "the different trajectories are then obtained by sampling @xmath122 equally spaced initial conditions that cover the entire range of @xmath123 values .",
    "the moment of arriving at the second boundary @xmath124 , as well as the coordinates @xmath125 are not explicitly specified . in effect",
    ", we apply a shooting approach that involves a set of different trajectories with particular initial conditions , whereby all the trajectories terminate at the spiking branch of the cubic nullcline .",
    "system is integrated by a standard solver implementing the fourth - order runge - kutta routine .",
    "the cost function @xmath91 is calculated along each of the trajectories , and we single out the trajectory that corresponds to a local minimum having the smallest value of angular momentum at the terminating boundary ( typically of the order of @xmath126 or less ) .",
    "note that the analogous numerical approach is applied in case of two interacting units .",
    "the only difference is that the initial conditions are parameterized in terms of three , instead of a single angular variable .",
    "we systematically examined how the @xmath3s change under variation of the ratio of external vs internal noise intensity @xmath127 .",
    "it has been established that the @xmath3 profiles are not sensitive to gradual changes over the whole range of @xmath127 values . in particular , when slowly increasing @xmath127 , the trajectories are found to either exhibit barely visible changes in shape , or to converge to each other once the `` ghost separatrix '' is crossed .",
    "therefore , in qualitative terms one may single out three characteristic forms of solutions , corresponding to cases @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which can be held representative for the problem of first pulse emission . in other words ,",
    "the topological features of @xmath3s are primarily sensitive to whether a particular noise source or both sources are present in the system .",
    "the other point one has to consider is the impact of the noise intensity @xmath92 .",
    "naturally , the physical picture described above is maintained for sufficiently small @xmath92 .",
    "the analysis provided in subsection [ numerics ] will show that the term `` sufficiently small '' @xmath92 effectively implies that the system lies sufficiently away from the stochastic bifurcation underlying transition from stochastically stable fixed point to the noise - induced oscillations . above the stochastic bifurcation ,",
    "the attractive power of the fixed point is no longer felt , such that the noise can move the phase point away from equilibrium without an opposing force .",
    "thus , if one focuses on @xmath3s for any of the three characteristic @xmath127 ratios , the impact of noise will become substantial as one approaches the stochastic bifurcation , and will become overwhelming above the stochastic bifurcation .",
    "note that for large @xmath92 , the @xmath3s determined via the method introduced in subsection [ method ] lose physical meaning , because the fluctuations over an ensemble of stochastic realizations grow too large to be accurately described by the maximums of the prehistory probability density @xmath74 .",
    "the influence of noise is reflected in the increase of the skewness and the kurtosis of the distribution of system s variables for different stochastic realizations at arbitrary @xmath75 .",
    "let us now consider some examples of @xmath3s in order to corroborate the points stated above .",
    "first we illustrate the validity of the method used to obtain the @xmath3s , see fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) .",
    "the figure refers to the case @xmath130 for @xmath131 , the noise value substantially below the stochastic bifurcation . by taking ten arbitrary realizations of the first pulse emission process",
    ", it is shown that the stochastic realizations indeed cluster around the @xmath3 , indicated by the open circles .",
    "we have observed that the distribution of @xmath61 values at fixed @xmath75 for different stochastic realization is narrow around the terminating boundary , and broadens towards the initiation point . with increasing noise intensity @xmath92 ,",
    "the changes in the shape of the @xmath3s become clearly visible around @xmath132 , the value close to the onset of stochastic bifurcation , cf .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the effect of noise is felt particularly strong in the region of phase space before the ghost- separatrix , which is indicated by the dotted line .",
    "an interesting point is that the larger noise may also have an inhibitory effect on the process of first pulse emission , in a sense that the phase point which has already crossed the ghost separatrix may still diffuse back to the basin of attraction of the fixed point .",
    "we further highlight how the topological properties of @xmath3s depend on the characteristic ratio @xmath127 .",
    "as announced earlier , the discussion is put into a broader perspective by comparing the @xmath3s to the trajectories generated by the effective hamiltonian system according to the prescription provided in subsection [ method ] .",
    "taking the case @xmath133 as an example , we first demonstrate how the problem of first pulse emission is different from the extension of the escape problem to an excitable @xmath0 unit addressed in @xcite .",
    "apart from the ghost separatrix , denoted by the dotted line , fig . [",
    "fig3](a ) also shows the optimal trajectory for the escape problem obtained using the standard hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the latter trajectory is indicated by the solid line which approaches , but does not cross the ghost separatrix , because the optimal escape path can not intersect the system s manifold . the @xmath3 numerically determined for the process of first pulse emission",
    "is represented by the open squares .",
    "the particular @xmath3 is obtained for small , but finite noise @xmath92 .",
    "such @xmath92 values may actually be referred to as intermediate , because on one hand , they lie below the critical domain giving rise to stochastic bifurcation , but on the other hand , they can not be considered as asymptotically small noise @xmath134 where the theory of large fluctuations would naturally apply .",
    "it can be seen that the initial part of the @xmath3 matches very closely the optimal trajectory calculated by the standard hamiltonian formalism , but also departs from it well before reaching the ghost separatrix .",
    "nevertheless , an interesting finding is that the trajectory generated from the effective system , cf .",
    "the thick solid line that crosses the ghost separatrix , matches quite closely the @xmath3 along the entire trajectory relevant for the process of first pulse emission .",
    "this point suggests that a theory using certain aspects of the standard hamiltonian approach could potentially be derived to characterize the first pulse emission process .",
    "[ fig3](b ) is intended to compare the @xmath3s for the two remaining characteristic @xmath127 ratios at @xmath92 values substantially below the stochastic bifurcation . as expected ,",
    "the respective trajectories show significant differences well before crossing the ghost separatrix .",
    "the trajectories generated by the effective hamiltonian equations in the fashion described in subsection [ method ] again seem to closely match the @xmath3s obtained by averaging over the ensemble of stochastic realizations . the profile of the escape paths in vicinity of equilibrium in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) suggests that the noise - induced linearization @xcite takes place in presence of the external noise .",
    "in particular , the latter is found to smear the effect of nonlinearity , such that the threshold - like behavior becomes smoother .      before proceeding to numerical results regarding the statistical properties of the activation process ,",
    "let us briefly consider the conceptual differences between the cases where noise influences the dynamics on the fast ( @xmath135 ) or the slow characteristic timescale ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "note that the `` mean activation times '' obtained from approximations introduced here are not intended to be compared quantitatively with the actual stochastic averages from sec .",
    "[ numerics ] , but are rather aimed at gaining qualitative insight into the distinct mechanisms by which the two noise sources affect the activation process . to this end , we use the standard approach which consists in reducing the original dynamics , given by with @xmath10 or @xmath11 set to zero , to an appropriate langevin equation of the form @xmath137 , where @xmath138 denotes the effective potential .",
    "if only @xmath10 is present , one may conveniently exploit the sharp separation between the two characteristic time scales .",
    "the analysis is confined solely to the fast variable subsystem , which is first rewritten as @xmath139 with @xmath140 . in the last expression for @xmath141 , @xmath29",
    "may simply be seen as a parameter , because the evolution of the @xmath29-variable takes place on a timescale much slower than that of the @xmath30-variable @xcite .",
    "another useful point is that @xmath141 has the form of a double - well potential .",
    "its two local minima , as well as the local maximum , correspond to @xmath30-values which are the roots of the equation for the @xmath30-nullcline @xmath142 .",
    "in particular , the local minima are given by the solutions @xmath143 and @xmath144 lying on the refractory and the spiking branch , respectively , while the local maximum coincides with the @xmath145 solution on the unstable branch of the @xmath30-nullcline ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "then , the activation process may be interpreted as a jump from the well at the refractory branch to the one at the spiking branch , whereby the phase point has to overcome the potential barrier provided by the local maximum .",
    "given that @xmath141 has a double - well shape , the escape time for a particle to jump from @xmath147 to a point near @xmath148 can be approximated by the well - known kramers formula @xcite @xmath149}$ ] . in our case ,",
    "one may fix the @xmath150 value , which corresponds to the minimum of the cubic nullcline . having determined the appropriate @xmath151 and @xmath152 ,",
    "we have obtained the dependence @xmath153 shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . naturally , given the crudeness of the introduced approximations , both in terms of system dynamics and the boundary conditions , the obtained @xmath154 values should not be compared to the mean activation times for our activation problem .",
    "the scenario where only @xmath11 is present can not be approached the same way as above , because @xmath29 can no longer be treated as a parameter .",
    "still , one may implement the adiabatic elimination of the fast variable to find the effective potential that influences the @xmath29 dynamics . though the roots of the equation describing the slow manifold @xmath155 may be used explicitly , the drawback is that such solutions are not easily handled analytically . in order to keep the subsequent form of effective potential analytically tractable ,",
    "it is more convenient to approximate the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 in vicinity of the minimum of the cubic nullcline by a simple relation @xmath156 , where @xmath157 refer to coordinates of the minimum . in other words , in proximity of the minimum , the cubic dependence has been replaced by a quadratic approximation .",

    "one readily finds that @xmath160 , whereby the plus sign solution is relevant for our activation problem .",

    "[ fig4 ] turn out to be consistent with the general trend for a single @xmath0 unit demonstrated in the next subsection , according to which the activation is more easily excited by @xmath11 than @xmath10 .",

    "the former is an average of @xmath5s for different stochastic realizations @xmath171 .",
    "the stochastic paths taken into account satisfy the specified boundary conditions , such that the trajectories emanate from the deterministic fixed point and terminate at the spiking branch of the cubic nullcline .",
    "the coefficient of variation is defined as the normalized variation of activation times @xcite @xmath172 where @xmath173 refers to averaging over an ensemble of stochastic realizations .",

    "nevertheless , in terms of theory , it is reasonable and well justified to discuss the physical background giving rise to transitions between the different regimes .",
    "what we postulate is that the transition between the domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 may qualitatively be accounted for by the fact that the excitable unit undergoes stochastic bifurcation induced by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    ", one may invoke the qualitative argument that above the bifurcation , the attractive power of the fixed point is effectively no longer felt , in a sense that noise can drive the phase point away from equilibrium without meeting a strong opposing force . at the level of mean @xmath5s , this should be reflected as follows .",
    "below the stochastic bifurcation , the mean @xmath5s are expected to be longer , while above the bifurcation they should substantially reduce and also become fairly insensitive to further increase of noise . in other words , once the fixed point becomes stochastically unstable , the gross effect of noise is the same because the fixed point holds no attractive power to resist its action .",

    "one may state that the general conclusions reached in case of a single unit , cf .",
    "[ fig6 ] , persist for the activation events of coupled units , though the physical picture is more perturbed for the scenario with the linear than the nonlinear interactions . recall that for a single unit , only the external noise has been found to induce deviations from the typical exponential distribution of events .",
    "for the scenario involving the nonlinear coupling , there may be more noise domains admitting some distribution other than exponential , but the latter still constitutes the prevailing form of behavior .",
    "however , under linear interactions , it turns out that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 may give rise to a form of @xmath5 distribution completely absent in case of a single unit .",
    "the particular form is unimodal , and is numerically best approximated by the lognormal profile , cf .",
    "[ fig8](e ) .",
    "one can not suspect on the type of activation process producing such a distribution , though the explanation on why it is different from both the scenarios with a single unit and two units interacting in a nonlinear fashion likely has to take into account the existence of global bifurcation @xcite .",
    "as far as the effects of coupling strength are concerned , the @xmath5 distributions typically become narrower as @xmath40 approaches the critical value , viz .",
    "the tail at longer activation times is reduced compared to an uncoupled unit for the same @xmath60 .",
    "this point holds independent on the linear / nonlinear form of coupling .",
    "thus , one may state that the impact of stronger coupling is expectedly reflected in the decrease of fraction of the longer individual activation events .    the final point we address concerns the relation between the individual activation processes on the units making up the pair .",
    "this issue may be approached from two angles , either by examining the mean difference in the single unit @xmath5s , or by analyzing the correlation between the individual activation events . on the former point , we introduce a measure of coherence between the individual activation events averaged over an ensemble of @xmath202 different stochastic realizations , @xmath203 , as well as the associated coefficient of variation @xmath204 .",
    "@xmath205 is intended to describe the net effect of how much the interaction is able to enforce matching between the activation times of noise - driven units . to understand the relevance of this",
    ", one should recall that the coherence of the first units responses is an issue quite distinct from that of asymptotic synchronization between the spiking series .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) are plotted the dependencies @xmath206 and @xmath207 for the case of two units interacting via linear couplings , but qualitatively similar results are found for the nonlinear interactions as well . from fig . [ fig9](a ) one learns of a general tendency for the mean difference to increase with the internal noise . for smaller fixed @xmath11 , the spread of individual @xmath5s reduces under the action of external noise , but such an effect is lost once @xmath11 overwhelms the system dynamics . note that for large internal noise @xmath208 becomes comparable to @xmath200 for the coupled units , which suggests a typical scenario where the activation process of one unit is rapid , whereas the pulse emission of the other unit is substantially delayed .",
    "naturally , for the @xmath60 domain supporting small @xmath200 , the @xmath208 dependence tells us that both the units emit pulses virtually at the same time . regarding fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) , the gross effect is that the variation of the difference of single unit @xmath5s shows a steep increase above some `` threshold '' external noise , whose value becomes larger as @xmath11 is enhanced .",
    "similar dependence is found for the nonlinear interactions , but with the reverse roles of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "next we examine the correlation of individual activation times for units comprising the pair . the correlation is quantified by the correlation coefficient between the times - to - first - pulses of single units @xmath209 , where the angled brackets denote averaging over an ensemble of different stochastic realizations .",
    "the fields @xmath210 for the setups with the linear and nonlinear interactions are shown in fig . [ fig9](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig9](d ) , respectively .",
    "a common ingredient in both cases is that there exists a certain value of @xmath11 , above which the noise effects prevail .",
    "there the first - time pulses are neither correlated nor anti - correlated , viz .",
    "the correlation coefficient lies around zero .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath11 , the correlation between the individual activation events substantially depends on the form of coupling . for linear interactions , small @xmath10 then facilitates strong correlation , whereas for larger @xmath10 the @xmath5s become significantly anti - correlated . on the other hand , for the nonlinear couplings @xmath211 displays a more homogeneous dependence on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , the correlation is strong for small noise intensities , and it reduces with the increase of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 , whereby the rate of decline depends more on @xmath11 than @xmath10 .    as an interesting remark for future study , we indicate a potential link between the form of correlation of the single unit @xmath5s and the synchronization state of the stochastic units time series @xcite under the given parameter set . in particular , note than in case of linear interactions the time series of two units display a constant phase shift for small @xmath10 , which coincides with the domain where the @xmath5s are correlated . nonetheless , the time series show phase slips and amplitude fluctuations for larger @xmath10 , where the activation times are uncorrelated or anti - correlated . in a similar fashion , for the nonlinear coupling one typically encounters in - phase synchronization , at least for sufficiently small @xmath10 , precisely where the @xmath5s are correlated .",
    "these arguments suggest that the approximately constant phase shift in the ensuing time series should imply a strong correlation between the @xmath5s of individual units . in other words ,",
    "the ordering effect of coupling can make an impact on the activation processes of units in a fashion similar to what is found for long time asymptotic processes , such as synchronization between the unit s time series .",
    "we have analyzed the noise - driven first - pulse emission process for a single and two interacting type ii excitable units where both the fast and the slow variable are influenced by stochastic perturbations .",
    "our results concern two main issues : @xmath1 determining the @xmath3s around which the stochastic activation paths are clustered , and @xmath2 examining in detail the effects of two different noise sources on the statistical features of the activation process , further demonstrating how the statistics is modified due to linear / nonlinear form of interactions . for both issues , we have highlighted the impact of stochastic bifurcation , which underlies the transition from stochastically stable fixed point to stochastically stable limit cycle .",
    "since the study is focused on the process of first - pulse emission , one of the requirements has been to provide a clear - cut distinction between the spiking responses and the small - amplitude excitations .",
    "this has been achieved by introducing an appropriate terminating boundary set , given by the spiking branch of the cubic nullcline .",
    "note that our problem setup is different from the earlier numerical studies on pulse triggering , which have introduced the terminating boundary as a fixed threshold @xcite , as well as the recent study on a single @xmath0 unit @xcite , where the ghost separatrix has been used as a terminating boundary within the generalized escape problem .",
    "the advantages of our approach lie in that the terminating boundary is analytically tractable , while the adopted formulation further facilitates an immediate generalization of the activation problem from the case of a single unit to different scenarios with two interacting units .",
    "the differences in the event statistics between the three mentioned problem setups may depend on the system parameters @xmath13 and @xmath20 , as well as the noise intensities .",
    "regarding point @xmath1 , it has been established that the topological features of the @xmath3s qualitatively depend on which type of noise affects the system dynamics .",
    "this has been demonstrated by examining the @xmath3s obtained for three characteristic ratios of external vs internal noise , reflecting the scenarios where a particular noise source or both sources are present .",
    "for the fixed characteristic ratio , the @xmath3 profiles change under increasing noise intensity .",
    "the changes become apparent as one approaches the noise values that give rise to stochastic bifurcation . in case of two coupled units",
    ", we have shown that the topology of @xmath3s is substantially affected by the linear / nonlinear form of interactions .",
    "for the linear couplings , the respective @xmath3s of the two units are identical , whereby the solution lies comparably close to that of an uncoupled unit under the analogous parameter set . for the nonlinear couplings , the @xmath3s of two units may become visibly asymmetrical , depending on the noise intensity .",
    "while discussing the topological features of the @xmath3s , we have also indicated a somewhat surprising numerical finding that the trajectories of the effective set of hamiltonian equations selected according to a given predefined rule may show striking similarity to the @xmath3 profiles for scenarios involving both a single and two coupled @xmath0 units .",
    "this observation requires a more elaborate study , and suggests that a systematic theory possibly adopting certain elements of the standard hamiltonian approach to escape problems may potentially be derived for the problem of first pulse emission .    concerning point @xmath2 ,",
    "the statistical properties of the first - pulse emission process have been characterized by the dependencies of the mean @xmath5s and the associated coefficients of variation on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "note that the previous work on @xmath0 model has focused on statistics of first exit times in presence of a single noise source @xcite , which has typically led to the well - known kramers result @xcite or its modifications @xcite . compared to our approach , the treatment in @xcite is simplified in terms of definition of the considered quantities and with respect to the terminating boundary conditions .",
    "an important novel result is that @xmath6 and @xmath7 show nearly universal dependence on @xmath10 and @xmath11 for a single unit , as well as for two interacting units .",
    "in particular , the mean @xmath5s are found to display three characteristic regimes , whereby the transition from the domain of large @xmath6 values to the plateau region can qualitatively be attributed to the stochastic bifurcation .",
    "we have determined the noise intensities that give rise to stochastic bifurcation by introducing the model based on a gaussian approximation for the dynamics of a stochastic @xmath0 unit . by carrying out the bifurcation analysis of the approximate model",
    ", we have obtained the hopf bifurcation curve @xmath183 which qualitatively outlines the stochastic bifurcation of the exact system . in case of two units , the impact of stochastic bifurcation has been found to depend on the form of coupling .",
    "we have further examined the distributions of @xmath5s over an ensemble of different stochastic realizations under fixed @xmath212 .",
    "so far , little has been known about the profile of corresponding distributions even for a typical escape problem .",
    "in fact , the only available analytical result , derived from the theory of large fluctuations , indicates that the exit time distribution for the escape problem asymptotically acquires exponential form @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of first pulse emission is conceptually different from the typical escape problem , whereas the noise intensities we consider are small , but finite .",
    "still , in case of a single unit , we find exponential distribution of @xmath5s under prevailing @xmath11 , which is consistent with the poissonian process .",
    "however , the activation process dominated by @xmath10 yields a different distribution which shows a unimodal , lorentzian - like profile . for the interacting units , the profile of @xmath5 distribution is further influenced by the form of coupling .",
    "apart from the @xmath5 distribution , the form of coupling affects in a nontrivial fashion the correlation of individual activation events . as a qualitative explanation , in subsection [ statcouple ]",
    "we have suggested a link between the correlation of individual activation events and the synchronization features of the time series for the given parameter set . in this context , the future research should set the ground for potential application of the theory of large fluctuations to the research of stochastic synchronization in excitable systems .",
    "this study has shown how the analysis of activation process may be extended from a single excitable unit to different instances of two interacting units . in the forthcoming paper",
    ", our goal will be to examine the noise - driven first pulse emission process in an assembly of excitable units , focusing on whether such an assembly may be considered a macroscopic excitable element , and if so , what may be the analogies and differences compared to the excitable behavior of a single unit .",
