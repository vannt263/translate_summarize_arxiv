    "the well - known sine - gordon equation is an important differential equation in physics due to its multiple applications .",
    "for example , it appears in the study of long josephson junctions between superconductors @xcite , in the investigation of discrete arrays of josephson junctions coupled through superconducting wires @xcite , in the modeling of the motion of a damped string in a non - hookean medium or , more generally , in the description of the motion of rigid pendula attached to a stretched wire @xcite , and as a model for rapidly rotating baroclinic fluids @xcite .",
    "modified versions of the sine - gordon equation often appear in the form of klein - gordon equations , in problems such as the study of fluxons in josephson transmission lines @xcite , in the statistical mechanics of nonlinear coherent structures such as solitary waves ( see @xcite pp .",
    "298309 ) , in the study of alfven waves in nonuniform media @xcite , or as taylor approximations to problems that involve the sine - gordon model .",
    "the continuous form of the sine - gordon equation possesses many interesting analytical properties . for example",
    ", the sine - gordon equation is an integrable equation , a characteristic which does not share , for instance , with the nonlinear klein - gordon equation .",
    "the existence of traveling - wave solutions , soliton solutions and , moreover , nonlinear intrinsic modes ( called _ moving breathers _ ) , are also well - known facts associated to this equation @xcite . in summary , many interesting properties are already available for the analysis of continuous sine - gordon systems ; however , the theory underneath the foundations of this differential equation is rather far from being completely understood , whence it follows that the determination of novel results related to continuous sine - gordon media , as well as the study of new physical applications , are highly transited highways in the literature of applied mathematics and physics .    from a numerical perspective",
    ", the study of the classical , continuous sine - gordon equation has been a popular source of interest since its inception @xcite .",
    "for instance , josephson tunnel junctions were studied numerically via the sine - gordon equation in @xcite , while the numerical study of wave transmission in long josephson structures subject to harmonic driving was begun by olsen and samuelsen @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional langevin equation was solved through numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "later on , strauss and vzquez designed a numerical technique to approximate radially symmetric solutions of conservative klein - gordon equations @xcite , one of the most important features of their numerical method being that the discrete energy associated with the differential equation is conserved .",
    "it must be mentioned that , after strauss and vzquez s pioneering work , the development of numerical techniques with properties of invariance in some physical domains became a very fruitful topic of research .",
    "particularly , many finite - difference schemes ( implicit and explicit ) with properties of invariance in the energy domain were proposed for classes of nonlinear , conservative klein - gordon equations @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the nonconservative case has been left aside , and that its study has been recently initiated @xcite , motivated by the study of the nonlinear phenomenon of supratransmission of energy in certain dissipative systems , where the sine - gordon equation clearly dominates the theoretical @xcite and the applied @xcite scenarios .",
    "this article presents two conditionally stable , finite - difference schemes with properties of consistency in the domains of the solution and the energy .",
    "the numerical techniques are used in the investigation of the process of nonlinear supratransmission in discrete arrays of josephson junctions subject to harmonic perturbations in one end , for which the methods presented here seem to be natural choices in the study of the problem .",
    "section [ sec2 ] of this paper introduces the mathematical model under study and the energy expressions employed in the analysis of supratransmission .",
    "section [ sec3 ] presents two numerical schemes associated to our problem and some practical observations on the implementation of the methods .",
    "the next section establishes the most important numerical properties of the computational techniques ; here , we show that the proposed methods provide consistent approximations in the energy domain  a highly desirable characteristic in the analysis of the process of supratransmission  , and establish stability properties . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "our techniques are applied to the determination of the supratransmission threshold in the presence of several parameters .",
    "finally , the article closes with a section of concluding remarks and directions of further research .",
    "the physical motivation of the present work is the study of discrete , linear arrays of parallel josephson junctions coupled through superconducting wires , subject to harmonic driving on one end .",
    "the model considers the effects of internal and external damping , relativistic mass , and a generalized josephson current .",

    "notationally , @xmath11 is a nonnegative constant called the _ coupling coefficient _ , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are also nonnegative constants called the _ internal _ and _ external damping coefficients _ , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath14  called the _ mass _ of the system  is a real or pure - imaginary complex number that has been included in the system of equations in order to suggest possible , further applications of our technique to phi - four theories and super symmetry @xcite .",
    "meantime , the function @xmath15 is called the _ input intensity function _ , and it is a harmonic disturbance irradiating at a frequency in the forbidden band - gap of the system , that takes the concrete form @xmath16 . finally , the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are called , respectively , the _ generalized josephson current _ and the _ output current intensity _ of the system .",
    "it has been established @xcite that the inclusion of two convenient nodes , one located at the beginning and the other at the end of the array of the @xmath1 josephson junctions in ( [ eqn : main1 ] ) , transforms our initial - value problem into the equivalent initial - value problem with boundary data @xmath19 where @xmath20 for every @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
