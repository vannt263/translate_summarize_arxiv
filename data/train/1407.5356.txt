    "in addition to these , their physical properties , like making ups or deep natures , are still unknown . revealing the distribution and",
    "the nature of dark matter is one of the most interesting challenges in the fields of both cosmology and particle physics .",
    "many dark matter candidates have been proposed . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )",
    "is the most compelling one among them .",
    "many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) theories , such as supersymmetry@xcite , warped@xcite and universal@xcite extra dimensions or little higgs models@xcite , etc , predict good candidates for the wimps and for the cosmological requirements , i.e. , the wimp abundance is a natural consequence of the thermal history of the universe@xcite .",
    "although well motivated , there is still no experimental evidence to support these theories",
    ". it will be difficult to judge which theory is proper for dark matter .",
    "even the observations of dark matter itself from future experiments may not provide enough information to distinguish underlying theories . in this case , a model independent studies of dark matter phenomenology using effective field theory ( eft ) can be particularly important .",
    "various experiments are set up to hunt for the particle they make up and to reveal the nature of dark matter .",
    "for instance , through direct detection ( dd ) experiments@xcite , we can search for scattering of dark matter particles from the galactic halo on detector nuclei . through indirect detection ( i d )",
    ", we can detect dark matter particles by their annihilation into high energy standard model ( sm ) particles @xcite .",
    "in addition , particle production through high energy accelerators will be another interesting way of dark matter hunting . in this case , the dark matter particles are expected to be detected as a missing component , or manifest as an excess of events showing an imbalance in momentum conservation .",
    "there exist some experimental and theoretical studies include , i.e. , the visible radiation of a jet ( quark or gluon)@xcite , a photon@xcite , or a w / z boson decaying into leptons or hadronic jets@xcite plus the missing `` something '' .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern generates high energetic proton - proton ( @xmath13 ) collisions with a luminosity of @xmath14 and provides the opportunity to study very high energy physics . in such high energy , most attention",
    "is usually paid to the central rapidity region where the most of the particles are produced and where the most of the high @xmath15 signal of new physics is expected .",
    "indeed , the cdf collaboration has already observed such a kind of interesting phenomenon including the exclusive lepton pairs production @xcite , photon - photon production @xcite , dijet production @xcite and charmonium ( @xmath16 ) meson photoproduction @xcite , etc .",
    "now , both the atlas and the cms collaborations have programs of forward physics , which are devoted to studies of high rapidity regions , with extra updated detectors located in a place nearly 100 - 400 m close to the interaction point @xcite .",
    "technical details of the atlas forward physics ( afp ) projects can be found , for example , in refs.@xcite .",
    "the physics program of this new instrumentation covers interesting topics like elastic scattering , diffraction , low - x qcd , central exclusive production ( cep ) , photon - photon ( @xmath17 ) and photo - proton ( @xmath0 ) interactions .    dark matter searching will be an active topic and an important issue at the lhc@xcite . until now most works are concentrated on its searching through normal pp collision .",
    "however , it will also be very interesting to see the status of dark matter searching in photon - photon ( @xmath17 ) and photo - proton ( @xmath0 ) interactions .",
    "this is mainly due to the reason that photon interactions at the lhc are believed to be simple and clean from challenged backgrounds .",
    "the study of photon interactions at the lhc might be a choice of extending the discovery bounds of dark matter as which that will be shown in our discussion . in this paper , we focus on the @xmath0 photoproduction of jet plus missing energy signal to set limits on the couplings of the fermionic dark matter to the quarks at the lhc via the main reaction @xmath1 .",
    "we assume a typical lhc multipurpose forward detectors and work in a model independent eft framework .",
    "paper is organized as follow : we build the calculation framework in section 2 including a brief introduction to @xmath0 collision and to the wimp production process we are interested in .",
    "section 3 is arranged to present the numerical results and background analysis .",
    "typically , the single diffractive ( sd ) production as background to @xmath0 productions is considered .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in the last section .",

    "the kinematics of a forward proton is often described by means of the reduced energy loss @xmath19 , which is also defined as the forward detector acceptance : @xmath20 where e is the initial energy of the beam and @xmath21 is the square of the centre of mass energy .",
    "@xmath22 is the energy after the interaction and @xmath23 is the energy that the proton lost in the interaction .    the possibility of adding forward proton detectors to both the atlas and the cms experiments has received quite some attention , since the forward proton tagging would provide a very clean environment for new physics searches .",
    "different from usual @xmath13 deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , incoming protons dissociate into partons , jets will be made from the proton remnants which create some ambiguities and make the new physics signal detection suffer from incredible backgrounds , @xmath17 and @xmath0 collisions can provide more clean environment . in this case , the quasi - real photons emit with very low virtuality from protons , leave the radiating proton intact , thus provide an extra experimental handle ( forward proton tagging ) to help reduce the backgrounds .",
    "if both incoming and emitted protons remain intact , then it provides the @xmath17 collisions , which can be cleaner than the @xmath0 collisions .",
    "however , @xmath0 collisions have higher energy and effective luminosity with respect to @xmath17 collisions",

    "similar to the parton distribution functions , the dpdfs are also obtained from deep inelastic scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "the difference is that they contain a dependence on some additional variables which are used to describe the proton kinematics : the relative energy loss @xmath19 and four - momentum transfer t , which we introduce as @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes either the quark or the gluon distributions with d refers to `` diffractive '' .",

    "this is mainly because @xmath178 belong to the region where single diffractive productions are strongly suppressed , leaving electroweak photoproductions the main background which are indeed quite small with our kinematic cuts , thus lead to a better signal over background ratio . assuming a 3@xmath146 deviation of signal from background , for @xmath7 , @xmath0 collision of @xmath172 can probe @xmath177 up to @xmath179 , a factor of 2.5 above the best current bounds from lep-2@xcite .",
    "our bounds are comparable with the phenomenological study at a 250 gev ilc , however , worse than the polarized beams case@xcite .",
    "similar studies at the normal pp collider can be found , i.e. , in ref.@xcite where the boundary of dark matter mass scale can be probe up to 450 gev at 14 tev lhc with the a luminosity of 200 @xmath141 .",
    "further more , cms and atlas have both carried out the cut - and - count based monojet@xcite and monophoton@xcite analyses ( using @xmath180 of data ) .",
    "typically , for the searches through monophoton channel , in the case of d5 spin - independent operator , values of scale below 585 gev and 156 gev are excluded at @xmath181 c.l . for @xmath182",
    "equal to 1 gev and 1.3 tev , respectively .",
    "our results show that with the same value of luminosity , the bound obtained is comparable with that obtained by the forward detector acceptance @xmath183 , while smaller than that obtained by @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that the contact operator approximation may not be valid if the energy scale of the operator is smaller than the energy scale of the collider process .",
    "the bounds we have already obtained may only be somewhat heuristic@xcite .",
    "this means that an experiment can exclude such a range of @xmath184 . in our case",
    "the limit is relevant for collider dark matter searches , thus @xmath185 here is the invariant mass of the invisibles . in fig.[mxbound ] we also present the @xmath170 and @xmath2 limit boundary ( with dotted and short dashed curves , respectively ) of the range that should be excluded where the effective field theory may not valid .    in fig.[mxbound ]",
    ", we also present the bounds obtained when the luminosity becomes larger than @xmath186 , see , up to @xmath187 .",
    "however , we should mention here that as the luminosity become larger , identify the signal under the high pileup running conditions will be challenge : the hadronic background of multiple p - p interactions will be so large that any @xmath0 process will be completely swamped .",
    "this can be a drawback of @xmath0 productions .",
    "even though , purpose of our study does not mean to argue that @xmath0 production are better or not to probe dark matter than the other colliders .",
    "instead , the main purpose is to show the potential of @xmath0 productions on the dark matter searching . by applying the dark matter searching on the @xmath0 production with forward proton tagging",
    "we can have at least a general image of the dark matter searching through @xmath0 collision after the running of lhc but before the building of future @xmath188 colliders .",
    "moreover , the production channel we consider here ( @xmath189 ) is related by crossing symmetry to the hard process considered in monophoton dark matter searches ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "the advantage of @xmath189 production is the reduction in background associated with tagging the intact proton . while the advantage of the monophoton production would be that",
    ": a photon in the final state may be cleaner than a jet , and one is more likely to get a @xmath191 from the initial proton than a photon .",
    "it will also be interesting to study a monophoton search in which the initial q or @xmath192 arises from pomerons which would have a potentially larger production cross - section , and a cleaner final state .",
    "a similar study has been presented in ref.@xcite where they concentrate on the standard model z boson production .",
    "it can also be extended to the study of new physics , i.e. , dark matter searches .",
    "a detailed discussion on kinds of these productions might be beyond the scope of this work , we address here the possibility and interesting to study them , and will work on this in a parallel paper .",
    "dark matter searches at the high energy colliders have received a lot of attention .",
    "the study of wimps in a model independent effective field theory ( eft ) approach is of particularly interesting . even if a process can be traced back to a definite set of operators , it is rarely the case that a particular collider signature can be traced back to a unique process .",
    "for this reason many different , complementary measurements on different collider modes and production channels are usually required to uncover the underlying new physics .",
    "lhc provides opportunities to open new fields of the study on the @xmath17 and @xmath0 collisions with very high energy but very low backgrounds thanks to the forward proton projects .",
    "attention can be paid now to physics in the central rapidity region where the most of the high @xmath15 signal of new physics is expected .    in this paper , we investigate the @xmath0 photoproduction of jet plus missing energy signal to set limits on the couplings of the fermionic dark matter to the quarks at the lhc via the main reaction @xmath1 .",
