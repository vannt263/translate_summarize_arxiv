    "one of the main issues of the `` second string revolution '' ( 1995 ) is the concept of string dualities which provided a new insight into the non  perturbative side of the known superstring theories .",
    "these dualities are mappings between regimes of different superstring theories ( some of them have been verified while other just conjectured ) .",
    "their existence naturally induces to consider the known superstring theories as perturbative realizations on different backgrounds of a fundamental theory of gravity ( ftg ) whose general formulation however is still missing .",
    "it is known that the low energy limit of superstring theory is described by supergravity .",
    "although supergravity in this picture is regarded just as a _",
    "macroscopic _ theory , it is expected to possess important informations about the ftg . indeed , it has been argued @xcite that the largest ( continuous ) global symmetry group @xmath2 of the supergravity field equations and bianchi identities at classical level should encode the definition , as a suitable discrete group @xmath3 , of the conjectured superstring @xmath2duality , namely the ultimate duality connecting all superstring theories realized on various backgrounds .",
    "this duality is thus expected to be an exact symmetry of the ftg .",
    "unfortunately not much is known about the group @xmath3 , starting from the very definition and its action on superstring states . on the other hand",
    "the action of the group @xmath2 on the supergravity solutions is , in principle , known .",
    "a fundamental role in probing superstring dualities has been played so far by the bps black hole solutions of supergravity .",
    "these solutions are characterized by the property of preserving a fraction of the original supersymmetries , and this feature protects their physical quantities , to a certain extent , from quantum corrections . as a consequence of their supersymmetry , bps black holes in supergravity are expected to correspond to exact solutions of superstring theory .",
    "the bps condition moreover is @xmath2duality invariant .",
    "this allows to characterize these supergravity solutions within orbits of the continuous @xmath2duality group , defined by a certain number of @xmath2invariants @xmath4 ( e.g. the entropy ) .",
    "all the physical properties of the bps solutions entering the same @xmath2duality orbit are expected to be encoded in the corresponding _ generating solution_. the generating solution of bps black holes is defined , within a certain supergravity theory , as the solution depending on the least number of parameters such that the invariants @xmath4 are free for a certain choice of the boundary conditions . as a consequence of its definition , by acting on the generating solution by means of @xmath2",
    "one recovers the whole @xmath2duality orbit .",
    "a suitable discrete set of points within this orbit should correspond to superstring black holes ( non  perturbative solutions ) connected by the action of @xmath3 and which therefore represent different descriptions of a same solution within the ftg ( see figure [ uu ] ) .",
    "[ uu ] epsf    the microscopic degrees of freedom described by the ftg are indeed related to invariants of the group @xmath3 . pinpointing the _ exact _ correspondence between the macroscopic ( supergravity ) and microscopic descriptions ( e.g. in terms of d  branes in a suitable regime ) of a generating solution",
    ", one would in principle be able to study systematically the microscopic realization of a generic solution in the same orbit .",
    "moreover this could be the first step in order to unravel the action of @xmath3 on stringy objects in higher dimensions and to ultimately deduce their fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "here we review some recent results achieved in @xcite where a macroscopic ( supergravity ) starting point was adopted for a systematic microscopic analysis of regular bps ( static , spherically symmetric ) black holes within type ii ( m ) theory compactified down to four dimensions on tori , and whose zero modes are described by @xmath5 four dimensional supergravity .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall start addressing the question : _ how much can we learn at classical supergravity level about the microscopic description of a bps solution ?",
    "_ a possible answer will lead us to discuss the mathematical analysis carried out in @xcite which provides an intrinsic group theoretical characterization of the scalar and vector fields in the @xmath6 theory in terms of dimensionally reduced type ii fields .",
    "the geometrical framework so defined turns out to provide the convenient `` laboratory '' in which to systematically study the microscopic descriptions of bps solutions and their duality relations . using these tools one",
    "can then characterize r ",
    "r charged generating solutions of regular bps black holes as elements of a suitable equivalence class defined with respect to the action of @xmath7 and @xmath8 dualities .",
    "this result is discussed in section 3 and allows us to formulate the precise correspondence , worked out in @xcite , between the parameters defining r ",
    "r charged ( d  brane ) microscopic descriptions of black hole solutions and the supergravity quantities related to its macroscopic descriptions .",
    "this will be used , in section 4 , for providing a type iia / iib / m  theory description of the generating solution of regular bps black holes , and a prediction on the expression of the macroscopic entropy ( at tree level ) in terms of microscopic parameters . finally , in section 5 , focusing on the m - theory description of the generating solution , the same expression for the entropy will be retrieved from a counting of bps micro  states , extending the analysis in @xcite to the toroidal case .",
    "this last result was achieved in @xcite . from the very definition of generating solution",
    ", this analysis accounts for the microscopic entropy of the most general black hole solution of this kind .",
    "the only prediction which may be drawn at classical supergravity level on the microscopic description of a bps solution is clearly limited to the background fields which couple to it .",
    "this can be done for instance by associating each superstring scalar and vector zero  mode with quantities intrinsic to the @xmath2duality group of the low  energy supergravity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 supergravity is a maximally extended supersymmetric theory , i.e. it has @xmath9 supercharges .",
    "its bosonic sector consists of the graviton , @xmath10 scalar fields , spanning the homogeneous manifold @xmath11 , and 28 vector fields .",
    "the latter are related to a vector of @xmath12 _ quantized charges _ @xmath13 , which transforms in the @xmath14 of @xmath15 , and a _ central charge _",
    "matrix @xmath16 entering the local realization on the moduli space of the supersymmetry algebra and transforming in the @xmath17 of @xmath18 .",
    "the former charges are moduli  independent and should be regarded just as supergravity parameters , while the latter are moduli dependent and are related to the physical charges , i.e. the actual charges one would measure in the asymptotically flat radial infinity of a black hole solution .",
    "the @xmath2duality group of the classical theory is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it acts as a generalized electro  magnetic duality ,",
    "i.e. it has a non  linear action on the scalar fields and a linear ( symplectic ) action on the vector of quantized charges .",
    "as previously mentioned , the @xmath6 theory describes the low  energy limit of type ii superstring theory on @xmath20 ( or m  theory on @xmath21 ) . the first step towards",
    "a group theoretical characterization of the ten  dimensional origin of the scalars and charges in this supergravity model is to use a linear algebraic description of the scalar fields .",
    "this is achieved by adopting the _ solvable lie algebra _ ( sla ) parameterization of the scalar manifold @xcite , which consists in describing the scalar fields as local parameters of a solvable lie algebra which generates ( globally ) the scalar manifold as a solvable lie group .",
    "homogeneous non  compact manifolds of symmetric type like @xmath22 do admit such a representation : @xmath23 the algebra @xmath24 is defined by the iwasawa decomposition of @xmath15 and can be written as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cartan subalgebra of @xmath15 while @xmath27 is the nilpotent subalgebra of @xmath15 generated by all the shift generators corresponding to positive roots . in this framework",

    "these charges are obtained from the vector @xmath41 through a suitable rotation and are related to the quantized charged @xmath40 by a _ moduli ",
    "dependent _ symplectic transformation which makes them quantized as well @xcite .",

    "regular bps black holes are bps solutions having a finite horizon area .",
    "they where shown to preserve @xmath44 of the original @xmath5 supersymmetries and to interpolate between an @xmath45 vacuum of the form @xmath46 near the horizon ( @xmath47 ) and a minkowski vacuum at radial infinity ( @xmath48 ) @xcite .",
    "the physical charges of a bps black hole solution , as previously mentioned , are related to the ( antisymmetric ) central charge matrix @xmath16 which depends on the point on the moduli space @xmath49 , representing the boundary condition at radial infinity of the scalar fields , as well as on the quantized charges .",

    "secondly we choose the following boundary condition for the scalar fields at radial infinity : @xmath94 this allows to write the physical charges @xmath95 in terms of the moduli  independent ones @xmath40 and to use the former to describe the solution .",
