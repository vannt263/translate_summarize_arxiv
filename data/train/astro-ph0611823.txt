    "this unique pairing of an apparently young neutron star with a very low - mass companion could indicate that the neutron star was originally a white dwarf whose mass , as a result of accretion , exceeded the chandrasekhar limit ( * ? ? ?",
    "* though see verbunt et al .",
    "although orbital motion has never been detected in x - ray data , pulsed optical emission reprocessed on the surface of the secondary allowed @xcite to infer an orbital period of 42 min , which was later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a member of the class of objects known as  ultracompact \" binaries ( @xmath3 min ) which must have hydrogen - depleted secondaries to reach such short periods @xcite .",
    "it has an extremely small mass function of @xmath4 , which corresponds to a secondary mass of @xmath5 for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a very low - mass secondary would account for the faint ( @xmath7 ) optical counterpart and the high optical pulsed fraction @xcite .",
    "initially ,  was observed to be spinning up with a characteristic timescale @xmath8 , but in 1990 , this trend reversed and the neutron star began to spin down on approximately the same timescale @xcite .",
    "the torque reversal was abrupt , although the decrease in bolometric x - ray flux has been gradual and continuous over the past @xmath1 yr . assuming that the x - ray flux is a good proxy for the accretion rate onto the neutron star",
    ", these observational facts can not be reconciled with current accretion disk - neutron star interaction theory .",
    "however , the fact that the pulsar underwent torque reversal implies that the radius at which the accretion disk is truncated by the neutron star s magnetic field is close to the corotation radius . with this assumption and a neutron star mass of @xmath9 , the measured @xmath10 during spin - up can constrain the accretion rate to be @xmath11 , which implies a distance of @xmath12 kpc @xcite . alternatively , measurements of the optical and x - ray fluxes ( assuming the albedo of the disk is @xmath13 ) give a distance range to  of @xmath14 kpc @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most unique characteristic of  is its x - ray spectrum . @xcite",
    "first reported the presence of ne and o emission lines in an  spectrum , and they found similar features in an  observation performed prior to the torque reversal .",
    "using a subsequent observation by , we discovered double - peaked line structure indicative of formation in an accretion disk ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s01 ) .",
    "emission line features such as these are not seen in any other lmxb systems , and suggest that the donor is particularly rich in elements resulting from later stages of nuclear burning  perhaps a c - o - ne or o - ne - mg white dwarf . a uv spectrum obtained with _",
    "hst_/stis revealed both emission and absorption features from c , o and si @xcite .",
    "the c absorption lines are stronger than expected from a purely ism contribution , suggesting some local contribution , and the line has a pronounced double - peaked profile , indicating an accretion - disk origin similar to the x - ray lines .",
    "the spectrum is missing common n and he lines typically seen in uv spectra from high - excitation systems , likely because  is lacking in these elements .",
    "a high - s / n optical spectrum obtained by @xcite using the vlt confirms the lack of he in the system , and finds h lacking as well .",
    "the optical spectrum is dominated by c and o emission lines , but does not appear to contain any ne lines . given the current understanding of the model ne atom , they find that ne is present in  at @xmath15 by mass ; or , equivalently , that ne / o @xmath16 .",
    "we present a series of four high - resolution x - ray spectra spanning three years , two obtained with the high energy transmission gratings ( hetgs ) aboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , and two from the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ) aboard _ xmm - newton_. we previously presented analysis of the first  observation in s01 , but this re - analysis uses improved calibration products and software .",

    "4u 162667 has been observed twice with the hetgs on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite , first on 2000 september 16 and again on 2003 june 3 .",
    "the hetgs comprises two sets of transmission gratings : the medium energy gratings ( megs ) , with a spectral resolution of @xmath17   fwhm and a range of 2.531   ( 0.45.0 kev ) , and the high energy gratings ( hegs ) , which have @xmath18   fwhm and a range of 1.215   ( 0.810 kev ) .",

    "this processing applied the gain , time - dependent gain , and charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) corrections .",

    "we created grating responses that include the time - dependent effects of a contaminant present on the acis optical blocking filter @xcite .",
    "correcting for this contamination is necessary for precise spectral analysis , since it affects both spectral shape and normalization .    neither _ chandra _ observation contained any appreciable background flares .",
    "after reprocessing and filtering out bad pixels , we applied the standard grade filtering ( retaining grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 ) , and used the tgdetect tool to determine the zeroth - order source position .",
    "the high source count rate caused the zeroth - order images to be quite piled up , but this did not hinder our ability to determine the source position .",
    "this position was used to sort the dispersed spectra into the proper orders , resulting in 62555 ( 101799 ) background - subtracted events in the first - order meg spectrum and 35343 ( 59706 ) in the first - order heg spectrum for obsid 104 ( 3504 ) .",

    "both observations were performed after the failure of rgs1 s ccd7 and rgs2 s ccd4 , resulting in gaps in the dispersed spectra which were filtered out for analysis .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ science products were obtained from the _ heasarc _ archive .",

    "however , the source core is somewhat piled in the mos2 detector , and was excised prior to analysis . during obsid 0152620101 ,",
    "the mos2 detector was in timing mode , and the mos1 detector shows mild evidence of pileup , so we again removed the central portion of source data prior to analysis .",

    "all the quoted errors are 90% confidence limits unless otherwise noted .      for continuum fitting , we excluded the known emission line regions , and used the wavelength / energy ranges 1.217.0 ( 1.826.0 )   for the heg ( meg ) grating spectra , 7.034.0   for the rgs grating spectra , and 1.19.9 ( 1.18.3 ) kev for the mos ( pn ) spectra .",
    "the lower energy ranges of the mos and pn spectra were excluded because they contain unresolved ne and o emission lines which artificially increase the overall continuum level .",

    "mos2 was in timing mode , and its spectral calibration did not match that of the other instruments , so these data were omitted from the continuum fit .",
    "we grouped the mos data to have a minimum of 50 counts and the pn data to have a minimum of 500 counts per bin , and the rgs data to contain 6 channels per bin ( resulting in @xmath29 0.04   wavelength bins , comparable to the instrumental resolution ) .",

    "we find that the current pulse profiles lack the double - peak feature that was seen before , and show only a dip which broadens at lower and higher energies .",

    "insofar as the pulse profile reflects the geometric and radiative properties of the accretion column and neutron star hot spot ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , changes in the pulse profile suggest that there have been fundamental changes in these regions of the system .",
    "while we do not speculate here as to the exact nature of these changes , we note that the accretion geometry may have changed at the time of torque reversal , affecting the accretion flow at the neutron star surface . therefore , the changes that are seen in the pulse profile may be related to the change in the continuum spectrum of 4u 1626@xmath067 that was observed around the time of the torque reversal @xcite .",

    "however , since the strength of the emission lines is very dependent on local plasma parameters , it is difficult to use them to determine elemental abundances .",
    "alternatively , a way of determining local abundances is to measure the depths of the neutral absorption edges and to compare these with the value of the interstellar absorption along the line of sight ( for example , as determined by the broader continuum fit ) .",
    "any absorption in excess of what is expected from standard ism abundances could be taken as an indication of material local to the system .",
    "the ne k , fe l , and o k absorption edges do not appear strong in any of our observations , including the first  observation ( obsid 104 ) that we analyzed in s01 .",
    "therefore , we are no longer able to argue for a significant overabundance of o or ne in cool circumstellar material as we suggested in s01 , at least not on the grounds of the absorption edge analysis ( see also section  [ photabs ] ) .",
    "perhaps these elements are , in fact , overabundant in the disk ( and thus the donor ) , but not much material is expelled from the system , or subsequently cools to form an absorbing medium .",
    "our results agree with a recent study of the optical spectra of 4u 0614 + 091 and 4u 162667 @xcite .",
    "these spectra did not reveal any ne emission features , only lines from c and o , which allowed them to place a limit on the ne / o ratio of @xmath234 . furthermore , 4u 0614 + 091 showed evidence of a higher c / o ratio than 4u 162667 , suggesting that its donor is actually more evolved .",
    "if this is the case , than the most significant difference between the two systems  the high magnetic field of 4u 162667 could be the reason that 4u 162667 has prominent emission line features whereas the other ultracompact sources do not .",
    "the emission lines have double - peaked profiles , and the line ratios imply that they are formed in a high - density environment , which suggests that they arise somewhere in the accretion disk ( see also s01 ) .",
    "if they are , in fact , disk features , then the measured velocities correspond to the actual disk velocities by the relation      the maximum disk velocity will occur at the inner edge of the accretion disk , which is truncated at the co - rotation radius of the neutron star at @xmath236 .",
    "the keplerian velocity at this radius is @xmath237 , whereas the line velocities are measured to be @xmath238 ( note that this is the velocity at the center of the gaussian in the double - gaussian fits , which is therefore an underestimate of the absolute maximum velocity ) . if we take this to be the velocity at the inner disk edge , we are able to place a constraint on the inclination angle of the system : @xmath239 ( @xmath240 )",
    ". we may combine this with the previously derived upper limit on the projected semi - major axis , given an orbital period of 42 min and limits on the timing noise @xcite , to find @xmath241 lt - ms .",
    "the line ratio measurements are indicators of the plasma conditions in the line formation regions .",
    "although we are not able to derive robust limits for the standard diagnostics , we note that the lack of detectable forbidden lines implies that the region is relatively high - density ( @xmath242 ) . furthermore , the relatively low value of the intercombination line ( @xmath243 ) with respect to the resonance line ( @xmath244 ) , @xmath245 , suggests that the temperature of the line - formation region is @xmath246 k @xcite . as was discussed in s01 , this temperature is characteristic of the highly ionized , optically thin outer layers of the accretion disk .",
    "x - ray observations of 4u 162667 show that it has been decreasing in flux since 1977 . since this decrease appears to be bolometric",
    "there is no sign of variable absorption , and the continuum spectrum is known to have undergone only one major change  we may use the x - ray flux to help determine other characteristics of the system .",
    "the long - term trend can be described by either an exponential decay or a linear decrease ( see figure  [ fluxhist ] ) . if we take it to be logarithmic , and integrate over the duration of the outburst , the fluence is 0.927 erg @xmath247 ( giving a total energy of @xmath248 ) . converting this to an average accretion rate , we find that      where @xmath250 is the time between outbursts in years and @xmath251 is the distance to the source in kpc . if we assume that the source is persistent and take @xmath252 yr , we find that @xmath253 kpc , which is less than the minimum distance of 3  kpc derived from considerations of the accretion torque during spin - up @xcite .",
