    "the study of sn isotopes beyond @xmath0 is currently the subject of great interest , as it allows to explore for possible changes of the shell - model structure when moving towards the neutron drip line . at present , however , some experimental information is only available for @xmath2sn",
    ". beyond this nucleus , which has an n / z ratio of 1.68 , lies a neutron - rich _ terra incognita _ which may become accessible to the next generation of radioactive ion beam facilities . in this perspective",
    ", it is challenging to make predictions which may stimulate , and provide guidance to , future experiments .",
    "in fact , over the past several years various shell - model studies have been performed @xcite predicting spectroscopic properties of hitherto unknown neutron - rich sn isotopes . in these studies",
    "both empirical and realistic effective interactions have been used , the latter being based on the cd - bonn nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) potential model . in this connection , it should be mentioned that a main feature of the study of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the short - range repulsion of the bare potential is renormalized by use of the @xmath1 approach @xcite .",
    "a peculiar property of @xmath2sn is the position of its first @xmath4 state which , lying at 726 kev excitation energy , is the lowest first - excited @xmath4 level observed in a semi - magic even - even nucleus over the whole chart of nuclides .",
    "this feature as well as the other observed excited states - @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 - have been successfully reproduced by the realistic calculations of @xcite . in that study a very good agreement was also obtained with the experimental @xmath8 value measured via coulomb excitation of a radioactive @xmath2sn beam @xcite .",
    "very recently , two sophisticated experimental studies @xcite have provided new information of great relevance to the study of sn isotopes beyond @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite a high - precision penning trap mass measurement has revealed a 0.5 mev discrepancy with respect to previous @xmath9 measurements .",
    "this finding provides clear evidence of the robustness of the @xmath0 shell closure . in @xcite ,",
    "the magic nature of @xmath10sn has been explored through the study of the single - particle states in @xmath11sn populated by a ( d , p ) reaction in inverse kinematics .",
    "this study has evidenced the purity of the single - neutron excitations in @xmath11sn and has identified a strong candidate for the @xmath12 single - particle state at 1.363 mev excitation energy .",
    "this is about 300 kev lower than the previous accepted value @xcite .",
    "based on the above , we have found it interesting to revisit our previous realistic shell - model calculations for @xmath2sn and extend them to the heavier isotopes up to @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we first give a brief description of the theoretical framework in which our calculations are performed and then present and discuss our results which are , for the most part , predictions for possible future experiments .",
    "a short summary is given in the last section .",
    "we have performed shell - model calculations for even tin isotopes beyond the @xmath0 shell closure , namely , from @xmath2sn to @xmath14sn .",
    "we have taken doubly magic @xmath10sn as closed core and let the valence neutrons occupy the six levels @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath12 , and @xmath19 of the @xmath20 shell .",
    "our adopted single - particle ( sp ) energies relative to the @xmath16 level are ( in mev ) : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "these values are taken from the experimental spectrum of @xmath11sn @xcite , with the exception of the @xmath19 level which was determined from the position of the 2.434 mev level in @xmath2sb assumed to be a @xmath26 state of @xmath27 nature .",
    "as for the @xmath12 level , we use the energy reported in the recent experiment of ref .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in this experiment the spectroscopic factors of the four levels @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath12 , @xmath17 were extracted , which provide a clear confirmation of their sp nature .",
    "the absolute energy of the @xmath16 level relative to @xmath10sn was placed at @xmath28 mev , as resulting from the new mass measurement of @xmath11sn  @xcite .",
    "the shell - model effective interaction has been derived within the framework of perturbation theory  @xcite starting , as mentioned in the introduction , from the cd - bonn @xmath3 potential  @xcite renormalized by way of the so - called @xmath1 approach  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we start by deriving @xmath1 with a cutoff momentum of @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "then , using this potential plus the coulomb force for protons , we calculate the two - body matrix elements of the effective interaction by means of the @xmath31-box folded - diagram expansion , with the @xmath31-box including all diagrams up to second order in the interaction .",
    "these diagrams are computed within the harmonic - oscillator basis using intermediate states composed of all possible hole states and particle states restricted to the five proton and neutron shells above the fermi surface .",
    "the oscillator parameter is 7.88 mev for the @xmath32 region , as obtained from the expression @xmath33 .",
    "the calculations have been performed by using the oslo shell - model code @xcite .",
    "experimental and calculated spectrum of @xmath2sn . ]",
    "we start this section by discussing our results for @xmath2sn , the only tin isotope beyond @xmath0 for which some experimental information is available . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "all the observed levels  @xcite are reported and compared with the calculated ones up to about 2.5 mev excitation energy .",
    "the experimental spectrum consists of a group of low - lying levels separated by an energy gap of about 1.5 mev from the highest observed level which has @xmath34 .",
    "the former correspond to the four calculated members of the @xmath35 multiplet while the latter to the maximum - aligned state of the @xmath36 configuration and all energies are very well reproduced by the theory . in the energy interval between 1.1 and 2.5",
    "mev our calculation predicts the existence of other states , namely the members of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 multiplets , and of the @xmath39 state of the @xmath40 configuration .",
    "it is worth noting that in our previous calculation @xcite the @xmath41 and @xmath42 states were predicted to lie above the @xmath7 state , their downshift in energy being directly related to the new position of the @xmath43 sp level .",
    "we have also calculated some electromagnetic properties and our predicted values for the first four excited states are reported in table  [ tab1 ] , where the two experimental transition rates presently available  @xcite are also shown .",
    "our calculations have been performed using an effective neutron charge of 0.7@xmath44  @xcite , which leads to @xmath45 values for both the @xmath46 and @xmath47 transitions quite close to the experimental ones .",

    ", it should be mentioned that several interesting questions have been posed by the new , although still scarce , experimental data which have become available for some nuclei in the @xmath10sn region . in particular , special attention has been focused on the properties of the yrast @xmath4 states of tin and tellurium isotopes , whose excitation energy shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to @xmath0 . in fact , in @xmath2sn and @xmath61te",
    "the @xmath62 energy undergoes a significant drop as compared to the @xmath63 isotopes , which was traced to a reduction of the neutron pairing above the @xmath0 shell @xcite .    with our realistic effective interaction",
    "we are able , as shown above , to reproduce with good accuracy the energy of the yrast @xmath4 state and its @xmath45 transition rate in @xmath2sn .",
    "this was also the case for @xmath61te ( see @xcite ) whose @xmath4 state is described as the corresponding state in @xmath2sn with the two additional protons coupled to zero angular momentum . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the @xmath4 state , as well as the other three lowest - lying states in @xmath2sn , are characterized by a very weak configuration mixing .",
    "therefore the small @xmath64 spacing reflects the small difference between the @xmath65 and @xmath66 matrix elements , which turns out to be about 0.4 mev .",
    "this result is due to the negligible contribution @xcite of the one particle - one hole excitations in the effective interaction of two neutrons above the @xmath0 shell , which are instead responsible for the increase of pairing below this shell .",
    "the weakness of the cross - shell interaction for @xmath10sn as compared with other lighter closed cores was also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was noted that the excitation energy of the @xmath67 state in @xmath10sn is only 0.5 mev smaller than the shell gap for neutrons .    we have investigated the evolution of the yrast @xmath4 state and of the other @xmath68 members of the lowest - lying multiplet when adding neutron pairs . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we report the excitation energies of the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 states as a function of a up to @xmath14sn .",
    "we see that the curves are almost flat , with a slight increase at @xmath72 for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 which becomes more significant for the @xmath73 state .",
    "calculated excitation energies of the yrast @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 states in tin isotopes with @xmath74 , 136 , 138 , and 140 . ]",
    "this result is similar to that found in @xcite , the main difference being that our @xmath70 and @xmath71 curves lie about 100 - 300 mev below those of @xcite , while is in contrast to the conclusion of the recent work of @xcite claiming for a shell closure at @xmath72 .",
    "the results of @xcite predict an upshift of the @xmath4 state in @xmath14sn with respect to the lighter isotopes when using an empirical interaction ( smpn ) as well as a realistic interaction with three - body monopole corrections ( cwg3 m ) .",
    "this upshift was related to the filling of the @xmath75 orbit at @xmath72 as a consequence of a significant increase in the difference between the effective single - particle energies of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 orbits which , starting from 0.854 kev , becomes larger than 2 mev at @xmath13 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    ", our calculations do not predict such an increase .",
    "the energy difference between the two orbits remains in fact almost constant and even decreases slightly by about 100 kev when moving from @xmath0 to @xmath72 . as regards the @xmath6 state , we find that its wave function in @xmath14sn is dominated by the @xmath77 configuration , which explains its increasing in energy .",
    "[ h ]    effective single - particle energies of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 levels from @xmath0 to @xmath72 . ]    in concluding this section , we discuss binding ( relative to @xmath10sn ) and one - neutron separation energies of the even sn isotopes .",
    "the calculated values are reported in table  [ tab2 ] , where the experimental available values for @xmath2sn are also shown . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", a new measurement of the binding energy of @xmath2sn has revealed a 0.5 mev deviation from the previous observed value . with the new mass value",
    "the maximum of the neutron - shell gap for n=82 is at @xmath78 , instead of @xmath79 as established by the old measurement .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between theory and experiment , which shows the reliability of the @xmath80 matrix elements of our effective interaction .",
    "this confirms the weakening of pairing for two neutrons beyond the @xmath0 shell .",
    "as regards the heavier sn isotopes , we see that the binding energy keeps increasing with increasing mass number , while the one - neutron separation energy remains practically constant .",
    "our calculations , in line with those of @xcite and the estimations of mean field calculations , seem to indicate that in this region we are still quite far from the neutron drip line .",

    "we have presented here the results of a shell - model study of exotic even mass sn isotopes from a= 134 to a= 140 . in our calculations",
    "we have employed a realistic low - momentum effective interaction derived from the cd - bonn @xmath3 potential without using any adjustable parameter .    the heaviest sn isotope for which there is some , albeit scarce , experimental information is @xmath2sn , so most of our results are predictive in nature .",
