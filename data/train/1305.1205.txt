    "since only a few relatively simple dispersion relations in plasma physics are analytical tractable , it is of practical interest to develop general numerical schemes for obtaining and solving the dispersion relations of given plasma systems .",
    "traditionally , one obtains the dispersion relations from the determinant of the corresponding dielectric tensor for the eigenvalues of the wave solutions , such as that of the kinetic code whamp ( waves in homogeneous anisotropic multicomponent magnetized plasma ) by ronnmark@xcite and the _ mathematica _ fluid code for magnetized parallel beam plasmas by bret@xcite .",
    "it is however difficult to generalize such treatments to include arbitrary number of fluid species with good convergence or to obtain all the solutions of a given system .    in this work ,",
    "we use a full - matrix approach to transform the task of obtaining the dispersion relations to an equivalent matrix eigenvalue problem by introducing a general dispersion relation solver pdrf ( plasma dispersion relation - fluid version ) for magnetized multi - fluid plasmas including anisotropic , relativistic , beam and weak inhomogeneity effects .",
    "our solver should be useful for investigating wave propagation properties in astrophysical , space , laser , and laboratory plasmas .",
    "we consider a multi - fluid plasma in an external magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the flow velocity of the fluid component @xmath1 is @xmath2 .",
    "the species densities are allowed to be locally inhomogeneous , with @xmath3 constant . for simplicity , temperature gradient effects are ignored , and the wave vector is assumed to be @xmath4 . we do not need to obtain the 3 by 3 dispersion relation matrix for @xmath5 , as done in many existing analytical or numerical treatments , such as in stix@xcite , ronnmark@xcite and bret@xcite .",
    "instead , we use the original full dispersion relation matrix and treat it as a matrix eigenvalue problem , instead of directly solving for its determinant .      we start with the fluid equations    [ eq : fpeq ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 , and    [ eq : fpeq2 ] @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the parallel and perpendicular adiabatic coefficients , respectively . furthermore , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that our anisotropy model differs from that of cgl@xcite , but can be reduced to that of bret and deutsch@xcite by setting @xmath17 . by further setting @xmath18 , we can recover the isotropic pressure case .",
    "after linearizing , ( [ eq : fpeq2 ] ) becomes    [ eq : fpeq2lin ] @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the off - diagonal terms coming from the tensor rotation ( see similar expressions in [ sec : pdrfu ] ) from @xmath25 to @xmath26 are related to energy exchange and are important for the anisotropic instabilities . an incorrect treatment or ignoring these off - diagonal terms",
    "can cause loss of the firehose and other unstable anisotropic modes .      the linearized version of ( [ eq : fpeq ] ) with @xmath27 , @xmath28 is equivalent to a matrix eigenvalue problem @xmath29 with @xmath30 the eigenvalue and @xmath31 the corresponding eigenvector , which also gives the polarization of each normal / eigen mode solution .",

    "we have assumed @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in practice",
    ", these often - used assumptions may not always be valid .",
    "for example , a finite external current @xmath58 would be associated with an external @xmath59 field . to determined the latter",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +      in the traditional non - relativistic multi - fluid or kinetic plasma systems , the maxwell equations are lorentz invariant and the conservation equations are galilean invariant , so that the overall system is neither galilean invariant @xmath64 nor lorentz invariant @xmath65 which can lead to inaccurate treatment of the doppler effects . for instance , the solutions ( both the frequency and the growth rate ) for the electron beam system ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) and the reverse ion beam system ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) would be very different , although these two systems are equivalent under a coordinate transformation . on the other hand , the relativistic multi - fluid plasma equations should be lorentz invariant .",
    "we now consider the lorentz invariant ( [ eq : lorentz ] ) for the single - ion ( @xmath70 ) relativistic cold plasma modes . the relativistic background density is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the velocity of the moving frame .",

    ", we consider the solution @xmath82 ( which corresponds to the largest real @xmath83 ) and go to the ion moving frame with @xmath84 ( but @xmath85 ) , which leads to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    ", pdrf gives the largest real part solution @xmath90 , and ( [ eq : lorentz ] ) yields @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the difference between @xmath92 and @xmath93 is only in the last decimal place .    for the @xmath94 modes , the doppler shifted wave vector is not limited to a real number but can be complex , which is also supported by pdrf . in principle , one can also consider the effects of nonparallel beams , as well as that of @xmath38 and @xmath95 , on the doppler shift .      the lower hybrid wave ( lhw , @xmath96 ) is a quasi - electrostatic mode , i.e. , @xmath97 . the polarization property of the lhw obtained from pdrf is shown in fig .

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    another interesting benchmark is the lh drift wave @xcite , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the gradient parameter and @xmath105 is the drift velocity in the electron frame , which can be due to the density or pressure gradient or @xmath106 .",
    "the equilibrium drift velocity is @xmath107 .    for @xmath77 and @xmath108 , ( [ eq : lhdi ] )",
    "yields the usual lhw solution , which is very close to the pdrf solution , as shown in figs .",

    "we can see that the pdrf solutions also qualitatively agree with ( [ eq : lhdi ] ) .",
    "the quantitative disagreement can be attributed to the fact that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : lhdi ] ) is approximate and is derived using a galilean transformation , whereas pdrf is more exact and is not galilean invariant .",
    "for example , for cold plasmas with @xmath77 but @xmath112 , the first row of the matrix @xmath39 is zero , so that @xmath113 does not affect the solutions , whereas @xmath113 will affect ( [ eq : lhdi ] ) when @xmath77 .    ) with transformation @xmath114.,title=\"fig:\",width=604 ] +      in pdrf , the effects of the pressure @xmath95 , the density gradient @xmath115 ( for local inhomogeneity ) and collisions @xmath38 are given by simple models and the relativistic effects of these parameters have not been included .",
    "however , it is easy to modify the equations ( [ eq : fpeq ] ) and ( [ eq : fpeq2 ] ) , or the corresponding matrices @xmath48 and @xmath39 , when improvement of the model equations is needed .",
    "usually one identifies a wave through its frequency . to see its other properties such as the polarization",
    ", one should also evaluate its eigenvectors .",
    "for example , strictly speaking , a pure shear alfn wave should not involve pressure perturbations , and a pure ion acoustic wave ( iaw ) should not involve magnetic perturbations . in the preceding section ,",
    "we have used the eigenvector to verify the quasi - electrostatic property of lhw .",
    "information of the eigenvectors can be useful for identifying different waves having the same or nearly the same frequencies , for efficiently exciting specific waves by fixing the initial condition or the source ( such as an antenna ) , for diagnostics of more detailed properties of the waves , etc .",
    "this is because the perturbations in a system are given by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 are the eigenvectors of the eigenmode and @xmath118 is the corresponding coefficient .",
    "the power spectrum of a single wave parameter ( e.g. , @xmath119 or @xmath120 ) can not accurately determine the coefficients , since different parameter values will give different power spectrums .    with conventional dispersion relation solvers ,",
    "usually only the wave frequency is obtained .",
    "one has to obtain the corresponding eigenvectors separately .",
    "pdrf provides a way to obtain the eigenvectors together with the eigenvalues .    to summarize , in this paper a general multi - fluid dispersion relation solver",
    "is provided , which shows good performance in several benchmark cases .",
    "the solver can include effects that can not be handled by conventional solvers .",
    "the full - matrix treatment provides a general and accurate method for obtaining the dispersion relation of waves in complex fluid plasma systems .",
    "a similar treatment for kinetic plasma systems is still under development .",
