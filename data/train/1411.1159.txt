    "the vast decay modes of the @xmath14 into light flavor hadrons provide us invaluable information on the mechanisms of light hadron production from the @xmath15 annihilation and they are also ideal for the study of light hadron dynamics , such as the @xmath16-flavor symmetry breaking and okubo - zweig - iizuka(ozi ) rules .",
    "we focus on two types of @xmath14 decays in this work , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath5 the light vector resonances and @xmath6 the light pseudoscalar mesons .    for the charmonium radiative",
    "decays @xmath19 , the dominant underlying mechanism is the @xmath15 annihilation into two gluons plus a photon , as advocated in many previous works  @xcite . while for the @xmath17 decays , both electromagnetic ( em ) and strong interactions will enter and an important issue is the interplay between the two parts , that has been extensively studied in literature  @xcite .",
    "all of the attempts to understand these @xmath17 decays are based on the similar model with slight variations . in this model , the dominant part of the amplitude",
    "is assumed to proceed through the @xmath15 annihilation into light hadrons via three gluons , which is the so - called the single - ozi suppressed diagram .",
    "later on , doubly ozi suppressed diagrams are also introduced , where an additional gluon is exchanged between the vector and pseudoscalar mesons . for the em interaction pieces , there are also two different kinds of diagrams , the singly disconnected one ( one photon exchange ) and doubly disconnected ones .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on different mechanisms . based on these arguments , the previous research works , such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite , proceed the discussion through directly writing down the amplitudes by introducing some phenomenological couplings for different processes .",
    "the @xmath16 symmetry breaking effects are also introduced at the amplitude level .    in this work",
    ", we do not follow the previous routine to further scrutinize and refine different terms in the amplitudes , instead we start from the very beginning by constructing the relevant effective lagrangians and then use them to calculate the amplitudes .",
    "one of the advantages starting from the effective lagrangian approach is that it allows us to make a systematic study of different processes by simultaneously taking into account different mechanisms in a consistent and transparent way .",
    "this approach is specially useful to incorporate the ozi rule and @xmath16-flavor breaking effects .",
    "the only theoretical framework that is generally accepted to account for the successful ozi rule in various hadronic processes is the large @xmath20 qcd  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that one can build a simple relation between the number of flavor traces in effective field theory and the @xmath20 counting rule , though some care should be paid attention to in special cases due to the subtlety of using matrix relations among the traces of products  @xcite . generally speaking , to introduce one additional trace to an operator in the effective lagrangian will make this operator one more order suppressed by @xmath21 , i.e. one more order of ozi suppression .",
    "therefore , it is convenient and easy to systematically include the ozi suppressed effects in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "another important benefit to work in the effective lagrangian framework for the processes of @xmath14 decaying into light hadrons is to properly incorporate the @xmath16-flavor symmetry breaking effects . in the chiral limit",
    ", qcd exhibits the strict @xmath22 spontaneous - symmetry - breaking pattern , leading to eight massless pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) , which obey an exact @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "this exact @xmath16-flavor symmetry has to be broken in order to be consistent with the small but non - vanishing masses of @xmath23 .",
    "the strong @xmath16-flavor symmetry breaking in qcd is implemented through the introduction of explicit non - vanishing quark masses .",
    "this feature of qcd is elegantly embedded in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath24pt )  @xcite through the chiral building block operators @xmath25 , which we will explain in detail later .",
    "apparently the chiral power counting is by no means applied to the pngbs in @xmath14 decays , since the momenta of pngbs are far beyond the validity region allowed by @xmath24pt .",
    "nevertheless even we do not have the chiral power counting , other ingredients from chiral effective field theory can be still useful for us to construct the relevant effective lagrangian for @xmath14 decays into light hadrons , such as the well - established chiral building blocks incorporating the light pngbs and the systematic way to consider the @xmath21 or ozi suppressed and @xmath16 symmetry breaking effects .",
    "in addition to the light pngbs , we also need to include the dynamical fields of light vector resonances .",
    "guided by chiral symmetry and large @xmath20 expansion , resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath24 t )  @xcite provides us a reliable theoretical framework to study the interaction between the light flavor resonances and pngbs in the intermediate energy region and it has been successfully applied in many phenomenological processes  @xcite .",
    "the building blocks involving resonance states from r@xmath24 t  @xcite will be also employed in our present work to construct the relevant effective lagrangian describing the interactions between light hadrons and the @xmath14 .",
    "these lagrangians offer an efficient and systematic framework to analyze the processes of @xmath19 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with the leptons @xmath28 .    from the experimental point of view , the first measurements of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are performed by the besiii collaboration very recently  @xcite and updated world average results for @xmath31 and @xmath32 are available  @xcite as well .",
    "these new measurements and updated experimental results will be definitely useful to pin down the unknown couplings in our theoretical model and hence to reveal the underlying mechanisms of @xmath14 decays into light hadrons . for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the vector - dominant - model ( vmd ) predictions of the decay rates are consistent with the experimental data . while there are around 2.5 standard deviations between the theoretical prediction and the measurement for @xmath35 process , which deserves further study  @xcite .",
    "another important issue we will address in this article is the properties of @xmath8 and @xmath36 mesons .",
    "the composition of the @xmath8 and @xmath36 mesons has long been a subject of theoretical discussions  @xcite and is of current interest with many new measurements with high statistics and high precision  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - mixing - angle description has been proposed to settle the @xmath37 mixing , going beyond the conventional one - mixing - angle description  @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the two - mixing - angle description scheme has been confirmed in various analyses  @xcite , and we have provided a mini - review on the @xmath38 mixing in ref .  @xcite . in this article , we extend the previous work of ref .",
    "@xcite by including the @xmath14 decays : @xmath19 , @xmath26 , @xmath39 , the form factors of @xmath40 , in addition to the processes with only light flavor hadrons , such as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , as well as the form factors of @xmath46 .",

    "[ conclu ] .",
    "we will simultaneously study the @xmath14 decaying into light hadrons and the light meson radiative decays . therefore two different types of effective lagrangians , i.e. the ones involving interactions between @xmath14 and light hadrons , and those only including interactions between light - hadron themselves , need to be constructed .",
    "the latter have been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and we simply introduce them below for completeness .    for the interaction operators between @xmath14 and light hadrons , we construct the effective lagrangian by taking the basic building blocks involving light hadron states from @xmath24pt  @xcite and r@xmath24 t  @xcite .",
    "a subtlety about the description of vector resonances in r@xmath24 t should be pointed out .",
    "the vector resonances are described in the antisymmetry tensor representation  @xcite , not in the conventional proca field formalism .",
    "the reason behind is that with the vector resonances in the antisymmetric tensor representation , one can collect , upon integrating out the heavy resonance states , the bulk of low energy constants in @xmath24pt without including the additional local counterterms  @xcite .",
    "therefore we will use the antisymmetric tensor formalism to describe the light vector resonances , as we did in ref .",

    "the @xmath50 @xmath24pt lagrangian to lowest order , @xmath62 , is @xmath63 where the last term stands for the qcd @xmath48 anomaly effect , leading to a non - vanishing mass for the @xmath49 field even in the chiral limit .",

    ", the @xmath8-@xmath36 mixing is parameterized by  @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the weak decay constants of the axial octet and singlet currents , respectively . by taking @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eq.([twoanglesmixing81 ] ) , the conventional one - mixing - angle scheme is recovered .",
    "analogously , one can choose the quark - flavor basis to parameterize the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing as @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "in this case the @xmath83 and @xmath84 states are generated by the axial vector currents with the quark flavors @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . obviously the two mixing matrices from different bases in eqs .   and",
    "are related to each other through an orthogonal transformation .",
    "so they are equivalent to describing the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing .",
    "if only the leading order of @xmath20 chiral operators with quark mass corrections are considered , the @xmath16 breaking by quark masses will affect the @xmath83 and @xmath84 differently in the quark - flavor basis , and the angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 will be equal .",
    "this is the characteristic of the feldmann - kroll - stech ( fks ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "if general operators are included in the discussion , the quark - flavor basis will lose these features .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the phenomenological analyses support the fact that the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are indeed very close to each other  @xcite . in the following phenomenological discussions we will explore both mixing scenarios in the singlet - octet and quark - flavor bases .",

    "we take the building blocks involving external sources , light pseudoscalar mesons and vector resonances from the chiral effective field theory to construct the effective lagrangian for the @xmath14 decays .",
    "the @xmath16-flavor symmetry breaking effects and the ozi rules are systematically and concisely implemented in this approach . for the processes with only light hadrons , we follow closely our previous work in ref .",
    "@xcite and use the resonance chiral theory to build the relevant lagrangians . two - mixing - angle scheme from the general discussion in @xmath50 chiral perturbation theory is employed to describe the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing in various processes involving @xmath8 or @xmath9 . comparing with our previous results by taking only the light hadron data in the analyses , we update the values for the mixing parameters by including the relevant",
    "@xmath14 decays in this work .",
    "it turns out that the present determination prefers more negative values for the two mixing angles @xmath208 and @xmath209 from the octet - singlet basis , or smaller values for the @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the quark - flavor basis .",
    "since we make a global fit for the @xmath14 and the light hadron data in this work , smaller error bars result for some of the couplings in table  [ tablepar ] , especially for @xmath210 and @xmath208 .",
    "this clearly indicates the relevance of the @xmath14 data for the determinations of the couplings involving only light hadrons and the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing parameters .    in a short summary",
    ", we have found a proper theoretical framework that can be used to systematically and successfully describe the @xmath13 , @xmath211 and the light meson radiative decays .",
    "another interesting and relevant subjects along this research line is to take the @xmath212 and @xmath213 into account , so that the famous @xmath214 puzzle in charmonium decays could be addressed .",
    "nevertheless , a straightforward generalization of the decay mechanisms from @xmath14 to @xmath215 might be problematic , as recently discussed in ref .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that the low statistics for the @xmath215 data can not be compared to the precise ones of the @xmath14 and light hadrons , it is not so clear whether it is justified to make a global fit by including the @xmath215 data as the ones considered in this work .",
    "therefore we think it is worthy starting an independent project to study the @xmath215 decays , specially to address the long standing @xmath214 puzzle , which is under preparation .",

    "<S> within the framework of the effective lagrangian approach , we perform a thorough analysis of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 processes , where @xmath5 stand for light vector resonances , @xmath6 stand for light pseudoscalar mesons , and @xmath7 subsequently decays into lepton pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the processes with light pseudoscalar mesons @xmath8 and @xmath9 are paid special attention to and the two - mixing - angle scheme is employed to describe their mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the four mixing parameters both in singlet - octet and quark - flavor bases are updated in this work . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the @xmath10 processes are predominantly dominated by the @xmath11 mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for the @xmath12 are presented . a detailed discussion on the interplay between electromagnetic and strong transitions in the @xmath13 decays is given . </S>"
