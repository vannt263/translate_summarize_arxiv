    "a measurement of @xmath33 opens an important window on the non - perturbative strong physics involving heavy quarks .",
    "the basic framework of the theory is well understood , however , there is still much speculation - predictions for the width range from @xmath34 to @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the level splitting in the @xmath36 sector is not large enough to allow real strong transitions .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the width of the @xmath0 gives unique information about the strong coupling constant in heavy - light meson systems .",
    "the total width of the @xmath0 is the sum of the partial widths of the strong decays @xmath3 and @xmath37 and the electromagnetic decay @xmath38 .",
    "we can write the width in terms of strong couplings , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and an electromagnetic coupling , @xmath41 : @xmath42 where the momenta are those for the indicated particle in the @xmath0 rest frame , and @xmath43 is the fine structure constant .",
    "this can be rewritten using the isospin relationship @xmath44 and relating @xmath45 to a universal strong coupling between heavy vector and pseudoscaler mesons to the pion , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the pion decay constant .",
    "all this yields @xmath49 the width of the @xmath0 only depends on @xmath46  @xcite since the contribution of the electromagnetic decay with branching fraction @xmath50% @xcite can be neglected .",
    "the measurement of @xmath46 is needed in the extraction of @xmath51 in semileptonic @xmath52 decays  @xcite .",
    "prior to this measurement , the @xmath0 width was limited to be less than @xmath53 at the @xmath54 confidence level by the accmor collaboration @xcite .",
    "the limit was based on 110 signal events reconstructed in two @xmath55 decay channels with a background of 15% .",
    "this contribution describes a measurement of the @xmath0 width with the cleo ii.v detector where the signal , in excess of 11,000 events , is reconstructed through a single , well - measured sequence , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "consideration of charge conjugated modes are implied throughout this paper .",
    "the level of background under the signal is less than 3% in our loosest selection .",
    "the challenge of measuring the width of the @xmath0 is understanding the tracking system response function since the experimental resolution exceeds the width we are trying to measure .",
    "candidates with tracks that have mismeasured hits , errors in pattern recognition , and large angle coloumb scattering are particularly dangerous because the signal shape they project is broad and the errors for these events can be underestimated , resulting in events that can easily influence the parameters of a breit - wigner fitting shape .",
    "we generically term such effects `` tracking mishaps . ''",
    "a difficulty is that there is no physical calibration for this measurement .",
    "the ideal calibration mode would have a large cross - section , a width of zero , decay with a rather small energy release to three charged particles one of which has a much softer momentum distribution than the other two which decay through a nearly zero width resonance with a measurable flight distance .",
    "such a mode would allow us to disentangle detector effects from the underlying width but no such mode exists .    therefore , to measure the width of the @xmath0 we depend on exhaustive comparisons between a geant @xcite based detector simulation and our data .",
    "we addressed the problem by selecting samples of candidate @xmath0 decays using three strategies .",
    "first we produced the largest sample from data and simulation by imposing only basic tracking consistency requirements .",
    "we call this the _ nominal _ sample .",
    "second we refine the nominal sample selecting candidates with the best measured tracks by making very tight cuts on tracking parameters .",
    "there is special emphasis on choosing those tracks that are well measured in our silicon vertex detector .",
    "this reduces our nominal sample by a factor of thirty and , according to our simulation , has negligible contribution from tracking mishaps .",
    "we call this the _ tracking selected _ sample .",
    "a third alternative is to select our data on specific kinematic properties of the @xmath0 decay that minimize the dependence of the width of the @xmath0 on detector mismeasurements .",
    "the nominal sample size is reduced by a factor of three and a half and , again according to our simulation , the effect of tracking problems is reduced to negligible levels .",
    "we call this the _ kinematic selected _ sample .    in all three samples the width",
    "is extracted with an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the energy release distribution and compared with the simulation s generated value to determine a bias which is then applied to the data .",
    "these three different approaches yield consistent values for the width of the @xmath0 giving us confidence that our simulation accurately models our data .",
    "the cleo detector has been described in detail elsewhere .",
    "all of the data used in this analysis are taken with the detector in its ii.v configuration @xcite .",
    "this work mainly depends on the tracking system of the detector which consists of a three - layer , double sided silicon strip detector , an intermediate ten - layer drift chamber , and a large 51-layer helium - propane drift chamber .",
    "all three are in an axial magnetic field of 1.5 tesla provided by a superconducting solenoid that contains the tracking region .",
    "the charged tracks are fit using a kalman filter technique that takes into account energy loss as the tracks pass through the material of the beam pipe and detector @xcite .",
    "the data were taken in symmetric @xmath1 collisions at a center of mass energy around 10 gev with an integrated luminosity of 9.0/fb provided by the cornell electron - positron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the nominal sample follows the selection of @xmath58 candidates used in our @xmath59 mixing analysis@xcite .",
    "our reconstruction method takes advantage of the small cesr beam spot and the kinematics and topology of the @xmath60 decay chain . the @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are required to form a common vertex .",
    "the resultant @xmath55 candidate momentum vector is then projected back to the cesr luminous region to determine the @xmath55 production point .",
    "the cesr luminous region has a gaussian width @xmath63 m vertically and @xmath64 m horizontally .",
    "it is well determined by an independent method@xcite .",
    "this procedure determines an accurate @xmath55 production point for @xmath55 s moving out of the horizontal plane ; @xmath55 s moving within 0.3 radians of the horizontal plane are not considered .",
    "then the @xmath65 track is refit constraining its trajectory to intersect the @xmath55 production point .",
    "this improves the resolution on the energy release , @xmath66 , by more than 30% over simply forming the appropriate invariant masses of the tracks .",
    "the improvement to resolution is essential to our measurement of the width of the @xmath0 .",
    "our resolution is shown in figure  [ fig : errorcompare ]    and is typically 150 kev .",
    "the good agreement between monte carlo and data demonstrates that the kinematics and sources of uncertainties on the tracks , such as the number of hits used and the effects of multiple scattering in detector material , are well modeled .    to further improve the quality of reconstruction in our nominal sample",
    ", we apply some kinematic cuts to remove a small amount of misreconstructed signal and background .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppisoft ] shows the distribution of the momentum    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : systematic ]    uncertainties on the width of the @xmath0 and @xmath67 .",
    "we have measured the width of the @xmath0 by studying the distribution of the energy release in @xmath3 followed by @xmath68 decay .",
    "we have done this in three separate samples , one that is minimally selected , a second that reduces poorly measured tracks due to misassociated hits and non - gaussian scatters in the detector material , and a third that takes advantage of the kinematics of the decay chain to reduce dependence on mismeasurements of kinematic parameters .",
    "the resolution on the energy release is well modeled by our simulation , with agreement between the sources of the resolution as predicted by the simulation and analytic calculations .",
    "the largest sources of uncertainty are imperfect modeling of the dependence of the mean energy release on the kinematics of the decay chain , the simulation of the error on the energy release , and correlations among the parameters of the fit to the energy release distribution . with our estimate of the systematic uncertainties for each of the three samples being essentially",
    "the same we chose to report the result for the sample with the smallest statistical uncertainty , the minimally selected sample , and obtain @xmath69 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "we note that if we form an average value taking into account the statistical correlations among our three measures we get a result that is nearly identical with equation  [ eq : result ] since the average is dominated by the result with the smallest statistical uncertainty .",
    "this is the first measurement of the width of the @xmath0 , and our measurement corresponds to a strong coupling@xcite @xmath70 and @xmath71 this is consistent with theoretical predictions based on hqet and relativistic quark models , but higher than predictions based on qcd sum rules .",
    "we also measure the mean value for the energy release in @xmath3 decay @xmath72 where the first error is statistical and second is systematic . combining this with the mass of the charged pion , 139.570 mev , with an uncertainty less than 1 kev @xcite",
    ", we calculate @xmath73 this agrees with the value from the particle data group , @xmath74 mev , from a global fit of all flavors of @xmath75@xmath76 mass differences .",
    "it also agrees well with the best previous measure from a single experiment that includes an evaluation of systematic uncertainties from accmor at @xmath77 mev  @xcite .",
