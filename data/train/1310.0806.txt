    "v926 sco ( 4u 1735 - 444 ) is a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) that is persistent in x - rays .",
    "the shape of its x - ray color - color diagram caused hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) to classify it as an atoll source .",
    "the system has an orbital period of 4.65 hours , discovered through optical photometry ( corbet  1986 , pederson  1981 ) , which showed a shallow sinusoidal variation in the light curve , interpreted as due to the varying aspect of the x - ray heated secondary object ( e.g. van paradijs  1988 ) .",
    "although sinusoidal variation can also be produced by asymmetries in the disk , for example through the varying visibility of an irradiated inner disk bulge ( hellier & mason 1989 ) or by superhumps ( haswell  2001 ) , the variation was attributed to the donor by casares  ( 2006 ) .",
    "a periodic variation in the h@xmath0 line observed by smale  ( 1984 ) was confirmed by smale & corbet  ( 1991 ) and attributed to varying emission originating from a bulge or splash region at or near the point on the disk at which the gas stream impacts the outer rim .",
    "augusteijn  ( 1998 ) found similar variation in he ii @xmath34686 and the blend of n  iii and c  iii emission lines ( @xmath44634 - 4651 ) produced by bowen fluorescence , and attributed both to a disk bulge .",
    "doppler tomography ( horne & marsh  1986 ) was carried out on v926 sco by casares  ( 2006 ) , using data taken in june 2003 with the fors2 spectrograph on the 8.2 m yepun telescope at the observatorio monte paranal .",
    "tomography of he ii @xmath34686 showed an extended area of bright emission on one side of the disk , suggesting that the variation in this emission does arise from a bulge in the accretion disk , consistent with smale & corbet  ( 1991 ) .",
    "however , casares  ( 2006 ) found that n  iii @xmath34640 emission was coincident with the estimated velocity of the donor star , as opposed to a disk bulge .",
    "they attributed this to fluorescence of the donor , irradiated by uv photons from the hot inner disk , as originally suggested for sco x-1 , along with several other x - ray binaries , by mcclintock , canizares & tartar  ( 1975 ) .",
    "our spectra cover nearly twice the bandwidth of casares  ( 2006 ) including in particular the h@xmath0 line for which no previous tomographic study has been done and which is particularly useful for studying emission from the disk .",
    "in addition to doppler tomography we also undertake _ modulation _ tomography ( steeghs  2003 ) which allows us to take into consideration variations in the brightness of the components of the system which are harmonic with the orbital period . as doppler tomography",
    "is limited by the assumption that the brightness of the components of a system do not vary , its combination with modulation tomography allows more accurate interpretation of the velocity maps of a system .    in section 2",
    "we describe the optical observations obtained and used for this study . in section 3",
    "we present our analysis of the spectral features . in section 4",
    "we present doppler and modulation tomography of the lines and end with a summary and conclusions in section 5 .",
    "observations of v926 sco were carried out on the nights of 2010 june 5,7 and 2011 june 22 , 26 , using the _ imacs _ spectrograph on the walter baade 6.5 m magellan telescope at the las campanas observatory .",
    "a long - slit diffraction grating with 600 lines / mm at a tilt angle of @xmath5 was used , giving a wavelength range of approximately 4449 - 7581@xmath6 ( excluding small gaps due to ccd chip edges ) , with @xmath7 km s@xmath2 ( fwhm ) resolution .",
    "a slit width of 0.9 arc seconds was used on 2011 june 22 and of 0.7 arc seconds on 2011 june 26 and 2010 june 5,7 .",
    "60 useful spectra were obtained , with exposures of 420 - 600 seconds , covering a total of approximately 1.5 orbital periods ( table 1 ) .",
    "henear comparison lamp arcs were taken after approximately every three exposures .",
    "the images were corrected for bias and flat - fielded , then the spectra were extracted using _ iraf _ optimal extraction for a weak spectrum , as described by massey , valdes , & barnes  ( 1992 ) , to give the best possible signal to noise ratio . anomalies due to cosmic rays and ccd errors",
    "were removed .",
    "the spectra were wavelength - calibrated using the time - nearest henear comparison arcs , with a separate second order polynomial fit of each of the four ccd chips across which the spectra were spread . in each case , the rms scatter was @xmath8 .",
    "the flux standard feige 110 was observed on the night of june 22 , 2011 .",
    "however , since none of our nights were photometric , we plot only relative intensities and give ews in instrument counts .

    "he  ii @xmath34686 display the classic double peak variation , with the peak shifting from red to blue over the orbital period as expected for emission from an accretion disk .",
    "the bowen complex varies in strength over the orbit but does not show the double peak behavior . in order to determine the relative contribution of the spectral features , we fit the average nightly profiles with gaussians . for the bowen blend we used gaussians representing the n  iii transitions ( @xmath44634,4641,4642 ) and c  iii transitions ( @xmath44647,4651,4652 ) . for h@xmath0 , he  ii @xmath34686 , and he  i @xmath36678 we used two gaussians each to represent the blue and red shifted emission from the disk . for all lines we used single gaussians ( for bowen",
    "this was at @xmath34641 ) to determine the instrumental ew .",
    "the fits are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fit1 ] and values for the fitted parameters are listed in table 2 . for the 2011 data , where we had full phase coverage , we also calculated equivalent widths as a function of orbital phase ( fig .",
    "the equivalent widths increase between phases 0.5 - 0.8 consistent with emission from the disk bulge .",
    "the source appears to be reduced in intensity from 2010 to 2011 , however since we do not have absolute fluxes we can not determine this .",
    "we do find that the equivalent width of the bowen complex is significantly reduced from 2010 to 2011 . since the 2010 phase coverage is poor , for the bowen complex",
    "we construct tomograms only for the 2011 data . the reduction in flux observed for june 22 , 2011 compared to june 26 , 2011",
    "is attributed to the larger slit size used due to poor seeing .",
    "the increase in slit size also reduced our spectral resolution ; hence for our tomographic analysis of h@xmath0 and he  ii(@xmath34686 ) we use data from june 5 , 2010 and june 26 , 2011 .",
    "the four spectra obtained on june 7 , 2010 were used only to complete the radial velocity curve .",
    "figure [ radvel ] shows the radial velocities for h@xmath0 and he  ii(@xmath34686 ) obtained by cross - correlating all 60 individual spectra with gaussians of fwhm as listed in table 2 .",
    "we used the spectrosopic ephemerides of casares  ( 2006 ) as listed above .",
    "the curves are in antiphase with that expected from the secondary and consistent with emission from the disk .",
    "our best - fit sine - wave to the h@xmath0 data give us a systemic velocity of -109@xmath14 km s@xmath2 with a semi - amplitude of 95@xmath12 km s@xmath2 .",
    "our systemic velocity is consistent ( within 2@xmath13 ) with the value ( 121@xmath17 km s@xmath2 ) found by casares  ( 2006 ) when using the wings of their heii @xmath34686 profile ( which are expected to follow the motion of the compact star ) and our errors are a factor of two smaller .",
    "our heii @xmath34686 is weak compared to h@xmath0 but its radial velocity curve peaks at the same phase as h@xmath0 .",
    "tomography is an imaging technique allowing two - dimensional velocity - space maps of a system to be reconstructed from spectra taken at multiple orbital phases .",
    "spectra are assumed to be one - dimensional projections of the system in velocity space at a given phase . under this assumption ,",
    "if an accurate ephemeris is known an inversion technique can be used to produce possible fits to the data . in this case , a reduced @xmath14 test was used to modify an arbitrary starting image ( e.g. a uniform or gaussian distribution ) such that the predicted data from this image fit the real data . due to the large number of possible fits for a given value of @xmath14 , the _ ` maximum entropy method ' _ ( mem ) is employed to select the image which is most likely to be accurate ; the image with the highest entropy is chosen at each iteration , on the assumption that a higher entropy corresponds to a smoother and therefore more physically realistic image of the system ( narayan & nityananda 1986 ) . for a complete description of imaging accretion disks using doppler tomography , see marsh & horne ( 1988 ) .",
    "modulation tomography produces additional velocity maps showing the magnitude of periodic , sinusoidal modulations in the brightness of the structural features of the system , in addition to the velocity maps of the time - averaged brightness seen in doppler tomography .",
    "this allows variations in the brightness of a system to be taken into account when interpreting the time - averaged velocity maps .",
    "although modulation tomography allows more accurate interpretation of velocity data than doppler mapping alone , which assumes emission to be constant over the orbital period , data with a higher signal to noise ratio is required . for a more detailed description of modulation tomography of emission lines , see steeghs ( 2003 ) .                  and",

    "[ mod1]a , b , and [ bowdop]b . in each case , the figure is split into four panels .",
    "the upper two panels contain the trail of the original spectra around the chosen emission line on the left and the trail predicted from the final velocity map , for which @xmath14 is minimized , on the right .",
    "lighter colors indicate higher intensities in each case .",
    "each figure also contains two two - dimensional velocity maps .",
    "the lower left panel is the same as those produced by doppler tomography , showing the brightness of the components of the system averaged over the orbital period .",
    "the lower right panel shows the amplitude of modulations in the brightness of the components of the system which are harmonic with the orbital period . in this case ,",
    "bright areas indicate the regions with the greatest amplitude of modulation .",
    "each of the tomograms is overlaid with estimated values for the velocities of the neutron star , the donor s roche lobe and the center of mass of the system .",
    "we used @xmath15 = 298@xmath183 km s@xmath2 as determined by casares  ( 2006 ) . since casares   suggested a range ( 0.05 - 0.41 ) of mass ratios for v926 sco we adopted their middle value of 0.23 , giving a @xmath16 of 68 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we tried both our derived value of @xmath17 and the value used by casares  ( 2006 ) ( @xmath18 ) for the systemic velocity .",
    "tests using a range of values near these velocities favored our derived value for the best fits .",
    "the keplerian velocity of the disk along the accretion stream and the ballistic trajectory of the stream are also plotted , with circles along each line indicating steps of 0.1 lagrangian radii from the compact object .",
    "because the time - averaged h@xmath0 and he  ii @xmath34686 showed little change in fwhm and ew between june 5 , 2010 and june 26 , 2011 , we were able to combine the data to improve our modulation tomograms .",
    "doppler tomograms for both years are consistent with the modulation tomograms but show less detail , so we present only the modulation tomograms in this paper .",
    "both lines show significant enhancement of emission in the lower left quadrant of the lower left panel ( figs .",
    "[ mod1]a , b ) ; the corresponding modulation maps also show strong variation around these regions as would be expected of any non - symmetric feature in the system .",
    "the enhanced regions are superposed on crescent shaped emission with the h@xmath0 tomogram showing a second crescent in the upper right quadrant of the lower left panel .",
    "since the ew of the bowen complex changed by a factor of two from 2010 to 2011 we made separate tomograms for the two years . because of the complexity and weakness of the bowen blend , we first constructed doppler tomograms .",
    "when the complex was stronger ( 2010 ) we had 0.9 phase coverage in only 12 bins , which led to poor maps and indeed showed only noise .",
    "in 2011 , although the complex was weak , we had full phase coverage with over 20 phase bins ( fig .",
    "[ bowdop]a ) , and found a hint of emission consistent with the disk bulge but no emission associated with the secondary as reported by casares  ( 2006 ) .",
    "a modulation tomogram of the 2011 data shows the same behavior as the doppler map for 2011 ( fig .",
    "[ bowdop]b ) ; however , as the phased spectra in fig .",
    "[ phasecur]c demonstrate , there is no variation in amplitude within errors of measurement .",
    "modulation tomography of the h@xmath0 and he  ii @xmath34686 emission lines in the spectra of v926 sco were found to support the suggestion of earlier authors ( casares  2006 ; augusteijn  1998 ; smale & corbet 1991 ) that the accretion disk around the primary contains a large , extended bright region , attributed to a bulge in the disk .",
    "our observations show significant changes in the disk and secondary star emission from v926 sco , both since the 2003 observations of casares  ( 2006 ) and between 2010 and 2011 in our own observations .",
    "we find that the fwhm of the bowen complex , he  ii @xmath34686 , and h@xmath10 are lower by a factor of about two compared to those reported by casares  ( 2006 ) .",
    "this suggests significantly lower velocities present in the system . while we only have ew in instrumental counts , we find that the ew of the bowen complex is of the same order or considerably less than the ew of he  ii @xmath34686 , whereas casares  found the ew of the bowen complex to be twice that of he  ii in 2003 .",
    "a significant reduction in x - ray emission is seen over the same period in the _ rxte / asm _ light curve of the system ; the x - ray flux has decreased from an average of approximately 18@xmath12 cts s@xmath2 in 2003 to approximately 11@xmath13 cts s@xmath2 in 2010 and 8@xmath13 cts s@xmath2 in 2011 ( see fig .",
    "[ rxte ] ) . in particular ,",
    "since the 2010 - 2011 data were obtained during the last two years of the operation of _ rxte _ , during which it is known that the _ asm _ was running at a higher gain than that used for calibration , the real count rate is likely to be even lower .",
    "this indicates a reduction in the accretion rate of the system . since bowen fluorescence of the secondary",
    "is attributed to uv heating of the secondary surface by irradiation , the lower accretion rate is consistent with there being lower flux from the disk and compact object and hence less illumination to produce bowen from the secondary .",
    "in both h@xmath0 and he  ii @xmath34686 we see crescent shaped emission as seen by casares  ( 2006 ) from he  ii . this suggests the possibility of an eccentric disk , a phenomenon that occurs at mass ratios below @xmath19 ( haswell  2001 ) .",
    "normally , the comparatively large mass of the compact object , together with conservation of angular momentum , leads to the formation of a circular accretion disk centered on the compact object . below this mass ratio ,",
    "however , the 3:1 resonance has been found to cause eccentric instability , leading to a non - axisymmetric , precessing disk ( haswell  2001 ) . in these cases",
    ", we would expect so called ` superhumps ' to be observed in the light curve of the system ( calvelo  2009 ; zurita  2002 ) . while superhumps have not been detected in photometric studies of v926 sco ( e.g. corbet  1986 ; pederson , van paradijs , & lewin  1981 ) an eccentric disk can not be ruled out .",
    "higher resolution observations at different epochs are required to either confirm or refute this possibility .",
    "the offset crescent shapes seen in the strong h@xmath0 tomogram may also suggest that angular momentum in the disk is being transported by density waves in the disk .",
    "this behavior has been seen in tomography of certain cataclysmic variables ( steeghs  2003 ) and references therein ) .",
    "steeghs  ( 2000 ) showed that two - armed trailing spirals in position coordinates map into two - armed crescent shapes in velocity coordinates .",
