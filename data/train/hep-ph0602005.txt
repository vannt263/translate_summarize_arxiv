    "regularization is a necessary step in any computation of radiative corrections or quantum effects in quantum field theory .",
    "its purpose is to provide an intermediate definition of otherwise divergent ( loop or phase space ) integrals . in principle",
    "any regularization scheme can be chosen as long as it is consistent with fundamental properties like unitarity and causality . however , in practice a wise choice is important in order to simplify the evaluation of the integrals as well as of the counterterms necessary for the renormalization procedure .    in practice ,",
    "the most common schemes for perturbative calculations are dimensional regularization ( dreg ) @xcite and dimensional reduction ( dred ) @xcite . both allow for very efficient techniques for evaluating momentum integrals . in spite of being the",
    "best known options , however , both schemes lead to well - known problems when applied to supersymmetric theories .    in dreg",
    "not only momentum integrals are continued to @xmath0 dimensions , but also gauge fields are treated as @xmath0-component quantities .",
    "the mismatch between the number of degrees of freedom of gauge fields ( @xmath0 ) and gauginos ( 4 ) breaks supersymmetry in dreg .",
    "therefore , special supersymmetry - restoring counterterms have to be added in order to restore supersymmetry in the renormalized theory .",
    "these counterterms do not originate from the original lagrangian by multiplicative renormalization , and hence their structure and evaluation poses a significant complication of the calculation ( for examples see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dred is better suited to supersymmetry because gauge fields remain 4-component quantities . in many examples",
    "dred has explicitly been found to preserve supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for a long time dred has been known to have several , more subtle problems , which are the main focus of the present talk . in brief",
    ", these problems are the following :    1 .",
    "the mathematical formulation of dred is plagued by inconsistencies uncovered in @xcite . as a result",
    ", certain initial expressions can lead to several different results depending on the order of the calculational steps .",
    "it is unknown to what extent dred actually preserves supersymmetry .",
    "a general proof that supersymmetry is preserved in all cases does nt exist due to point 1 .",
    "in fact dred will break supersymmetry in the gauge boson / gaugino sector at least at the 4-loop level @xcite .",
    "the important question is whether dred preserves supersymmetry at least in cases that are of phenomenological importance .",
    "an apparent inconsistency of dred with qcd - factorization has been observed in @xcite . although factorization seems to be a regularization - independent property and general formalisms",
    "have been worked out both for dreg and dred ( at least in the case with massless partons ) @xcite , the factorization - problem of dred has repeatedly appeared in the literature @xcite . in these references , dred has been abandoned as a regularization for hadron processes , even in the presence of supersymmetry .",
    "the question is whether and how it is possible to reconcile dred with factorization",
    ".    the following sections will describe recent progress on these questions .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to reformulate dred in a way that avoids mathematical inconsistencies , i.e.  such that any initial expression leads to a unique final result @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this reformulation is not different from the standard definition of dred as long as no purely 4-dimensional identities such as fierz rearrangements are used .",
    "hence , in most practical applications of dred ( in particular in all applications referred to here ) actually the consistent version of dred has been applied .",
    "the important practical consequence of having a mathematically consistent definition is that general properties can be proven . in particular ,",
    "the quantum action principle can be established for dred @xcite .",
    "this is a general relation between symmetry properties of green functions in a regularized quantum field theory and the corresponding symmetry properties of the lagrangian : @xmath1 here @xmath2 corresponds to any symmetry transformation , e.g.gauge/brs transformations , supersymmetry transformations etc .",
    "this quantum action principle , established long ago in the context of bphz renormalization @xcite and of dreg @xcite , is of great use in order to study symmetry - properties of regularization schemes .    in order to give an example of the direct relevance of the quantum action principle ,",
    "consider non - supersymmetric qcd and dreg and take @xmath2 to represent brs transformations .",
    "it is one of the most beautiful features of dreg that it does nt modify the structure of the qcd lagrangian , and therefore the lagrangian is brs invariant even on the regularized level , @xmath3 .",
    "hence the quantum action principle for dreg shows that @xmath4 the right equation here is nothing but a generic qcd slavnov - taylor identity . in this way",
    ", we find that in dreg all qcd slavnov - taylor identities are valid even on the regularized level ( and at all orders )  a statement of utmost practical importance .",
    "since the quantum action principle has now been shown to be valid also in dred we can derive the supersymmetry - properties of dred in an analogous fashion .",
    "the result for the operator @xmath5 corresponding to the supersymmetry variation of the lagrangian of a generic supersymmetric model in dred has been given in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the qcd / brs case it does not vanish . therefore , applying the quantum action principle does not lead to the statement that dred preserves all supersymmetry identities at all orders . on the contrary , one has to expect that dred will violate supersymmetry at some point , as already argued in @xcite . in general ,",
    "the quantum action principle yields the following equivalence : a given supersymmetry identity @xmath6 is valid in dred on the regularized level if and only if @xmath7 often in practice , ( [ genericdelta ] ) is a lot easier to verify than ( [ genericsusyid ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is important to know to what extent dred preserves supersymmetry .",
    "the reason is that only if dred preserves supersymmetry ( in a given sector / loop order ) the familiar concept of multiplicative renormalization is correct , where `` multiplicative renormalization '' is meant as a synonym for any of the following :    * counterterms are generated by multiplicative renormalization of the parameters and fields of the lagrangian . *",
    "the bare lagrangian has the same structure as the renormalized lagrangian ( which generates the feynman rules ) . *",
    "the bare lagrangian and the counterterm lagrangian have the same symmetries as the renormalized lagrangian .",
    "if dred violates supersymmetry , all of this is not true and additional , supersymmetry - restoring counterterms have to be found and added .",
    "the existence of such counterterms is guaranteed by the absence of anomalies and the renormalizability of supersymmetric models @xcite , but their necessity complicates practical calculations .",
    "so far , in virtually all practical applications of dred , dred has been assumed to preserve supersymmetry , however often without explicit investigation or proof .    until recently , the only explicit checks of supersymmetry in dred concerned one - loop relations for 2-point @xcite and 3-point functions @xcite and relations between renormalization group @xmath8-functions @xcite . these checks were done by explicitly evaluating all green functions appearing in the corresponding supersymmetry identity ( i.e.  the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ genericsusyid ] ) ) . they suffice to prove that e.g.  for one - loop calculations of processes such as sfermion - pair or chargino - pair production dred preserves supersymmetry and multiplicative renormalization is correct .    using the quantum action principle ,",
    "supersymmetry identities can be checked much more easily by explicitly evaluating the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ genericdelta ] ) . in this way",
    ", already several 2-loop identities could be shown to be preserved by dred @xcite .    in the following we consider the theoretical evaluation of the lightest higgs boson mass in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as a particularly prominent case where dred has been assumed to preserve supersymmetry in the literature ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "generically , the higgs boson mass is related to the quartic higgs boson self coupling @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vacuum expectation value . in supersymmetric models such as the mssm",
    ", @xmath9 is not a free parameter , but it is related to gauge couplings , @xmath12 therefore , supersymmetry determines the higgs boson mass , and precise theoretical predictions taking into account up to two - loop corrections are very important .",
    "the relation ( [ susylambda ] ) is the crucial supersymmetry - relation that has been assumed to be preserved by dred in all evaluations of @xmath13 described in @xcite .",
    "recently , this assumption has been explicitly checked @xcite .",
    "the check has three main elements .",
    "firstly , the supersymmetry relation ( [ susylambda ] ) is formulated on the level of green functions as a slavnov - taylor identity , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote higgs and higgsino fields ( for a more explicit and detailed form see @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , this identity between dred - regularized green functions is replaced by the equivalent relation @xmath17 by virtue of the quantum action principle ( [ genericsusyid ] ) , ( [ genericdelta ] ) .",
    "finally , the green function @xmath18 is evaluated .    the level to which the green function is evaluated is the level of two - loop yukawa - enhanced contributions , i.e. contributions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "this is the order of current state - of - the - art computations of the mssm higgs boson mass @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dangerous ] shows one of the diagrams that have to be evaluated .",
    "it turns out that the feynman rules corresponding to the insertion @xmath5 lead to rather simple rules as to when such a diagram vanishes . in cases like the one shown in fig.[fig : dangerous ] where one closed fermion loop and one outgoing quark line",
    "are attached to @xmath5 , the diagram vanishes if the number of @xmath22-matrices in the fermion loop is smaller than four .",
    "inspection of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : dangerous ] shows that indeed the fermion loop contains only terms with less than four @xmath22-matrices , and therefore the diagram vanishes . in a similar way it is straightforward to show that all diagrams contributing to the green function in eq .",
    "( [ deltagreenfunction ] ) vanish .",
    "this result proves that ( [ deltagreenfunction ] ) and hence also ( [ sticheck ] ) are valid in dred at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the factorization - problem of dred mentioned in the introduction has been first observed in the evaluation of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the process @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the real nlo corrections from diagrams with an additional unresolved final - state gluon exhibit collinear divergences from the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] if gluons 2 and 3 become parallel .",
    "however , contrary to expectations and experience from calculations in dreg , the collinear limit does not factorize .",
    "instead , the divergent part of the nlo cross section @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath25 the appearance of the lo cross section , multiplied by the splitting function @xmath26 is expected , but the appearance of the additional term @xmath27 , which is not proportional to the lo cross section , is puzzling . in dreg , the non - factorizing term is absent .",
    "the question therefore is whether dred has to be abandoned as a regularization of hadron processes or whether dred can be reconciled with factorization .",
    "these questions have been addressed in @xcite .",
    "the key to understanding what happens in eq .",
    "( [ colldred ] ) is to realize that in dred there is a mismatch between the number of gluon components ( 4 ) and the number of dimensions ( @xmath0 ) . as a result ,",
    "on the regularized level the 4-component gluon @xmath28 splits into a @xmath0-component part , denoted by @xmath29 , and the remaining @xmath30 components @xmath31 .",
    "only @xmath29 acts as the @xmath0-dimensional gauge field ; the fields @xmath31 are simply scalar fields , called @xmath32-scalars @xcite .",
    "it is natural to treat @xmath29 and @xmath31 as two independent partons",
    ". then diagrams of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] with an intermediate 4-component gluon @xmath28 can be decomposed into two contributions : one contribution with a virtual @xmath29 and another one with a virtual @xmath31 . using this decomposition it is possible to rewrite the collinear limit ( [ colldred ] ) in the following form @xcite :",
    "@xmath33 this form of the collinear limit is fully in agreement with factorization in a theory that has two independent partons @xmath29 , @xmath31 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the puzzling non - factorizing term @xmath27 can be written as @xmath34 hence it is obvious that the puzzling term only appears since the two partonic cross sections involving @xmath29 and @xmath31 are different . in some kinematically simpler processes such as @xmath35 with a massless quark @xmath36 these cross sections are identical , i.e.  @xmath37",
    "this explains why the factorization - problem of dred has only appeared in kinematically complicated processes such as pair production of massive quarks , squarks , or gluinos .",
    "in general , however , the result ( [ newdredexpectation ] ) demonstrates that dred can be reconciled with factorization .",
    "as explained in @xcite , this implies that there is no obstacle to evaluate hadron processes using dred .",
    "after recent progress in @xcite the status of dred is quite satisfactory .",
    "dred is consistent with factorization , and dred has been proven to preserve supersymmetry in a large range of cases , including 2-loop relations relevant for the mssm higgs boson mass .",
    "further studies of both aspects will still be important . in this respect",
    "it is promising that the validity of the quantum action principle makes feasible many future checks of supersymmetry - properties of dred .",
