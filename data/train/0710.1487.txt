    "over the last three - four decades major progress occurred in the discovery and understanding of _ integrable _ dynamical systems with a finite or infinite number of degrees of freedom , and over the last decade the possibility was noticed and exploited to identify and investigate many _ isochronous _ dynamical systems characterized by a time evolution _ completely periodic _ ( i. e. , periodic in _ all _ degrees of freedom ) with the _ same _ period .",
    "this _ isochronous _ evolution might prevail in the _ entire _",
    "( natural ) phase space of the model under consideration ( one talks then of an _ entirely isochronous _ system ) , implying of course that such a model is certainly _",
    "integrable _ ; or it might only prevail in an _ open _ ( hence fully dimensional ) region of its ( natural ) phase space , a phenomenology now known to characterize large families of _ nonintegrable _ dynamical systems possibly featuring quite complicated ( `` chaotic '' ) behaviors outside the _ isochronous _ phase space region ( for a review of these developments , see @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we discuss another , perhaps more interesting , phenomenology , namely dynamical systems whose _ generic _ solutions approach _ asymptotically _ ( at large time ) _ isochronous _ evolutions : _ all _ their dependent variables tend _ asymptotically _ to functions _ periodic _ with the _ same _ fixed period .",
    "definition _ of such dynamical systems is provided by the simultaneous validity of the two formulas    [ limit ] @xmath0 = 0~,~\\ ~n=1, ... ,n~ ,   \\label{limita}\\]]@xmath1_notation _ : the @xmath2 ( generally _ complex _ ; but see below ) numbers @xmath3 denote the @xmath2 dependent variables of the dynamical system under consideration ; we restrict consideration to the case when @xmath2 is a _",
    "finite _ positive integer ; the _ real _ variable @xmath4 denotes the time ; the @xmath2 functions @xmath5 characterize the asymptotic behavior of the dynamical system via ( limita ) and the periodicity requirement ( [ limitb ] ) they satisfy characterizes the property of _",
    "asymptotic isochronicity_. this property is supposed to hold in an _ open _ ( hence fully dimensional ) region of the phase space of the dynamical system under consideration ( possibly coinciding with its entire natural phase space ) : hence the dependent variables @xmath3 denote here ( the @xmath2 components of ) a _ generic _ solution of the dynamical system evolving ( at least for sufficiently large time ) within that region , while the functions @xmath6 which shall generally be different for different solutions @xmath7 are required to satisfy the periodicity property ( [ limitb ] ) with the _ fixed _ period @xmath8 ( the _ same _ for all the solutions in the phase space region under consideration ) .",
    "of course the formula ( [ limita ] ) does not define uniquely  for a given @xmath2-vector @xmath9  a corresponding @xmath2-vector @xmath10 : the time - dependent @xmath2-vector @xmath10 is only identified by ( [ limita ] ) up to arbitrary corrections whose effects disappear in the asymptotic limit @xmath11 .",
    "the property of _ asymptotic isochronicity _ is guaranteed provided there exist just one @xmath2-vector @xmath10 satisfying _ both _ relations ( [ limit ] ) , for every _ generic _ solution @xmath9 in an _ open _ , fully dimensional , region of phase space ",
    "namely for every solution @xmath12 in that region of phase space , except possibly for some _ exceptional _ , generally _ singular _ , solutions belonging to a _",
    "lower dimensional _ sector of that phase space region .",
    "the elementary idea underlying the identification of large classes of such _ asymptotically isochronous _ dynamical systems is to start from _ isochronous _ systems and then modify them by introducing a deformation whose effects are significant through the time evolution yet disappear at large time : so that the modified systems loose their _ isochronous _ character ( at finite times ) but in some sense retain it ( at large times ) as the dominant feature characterizing their _",
    "asymptotic _ behavior .",
    "there are several possible ways to implement this strategy in order to manufacture _ asymptotically isochronous _ systems : some are rather trivial , some less so .",
    "this kind of judgement is of course subjective : for instance we tend to think that an important requirement for such systems to be deemed `` interesting '' is that they be _ autonomous _  because the interest of dynamical systems is also related to their potential usefulness in order to model natural phenomena , which are generally described by _ autonomous _",
    "evolution equations  and moreover because the freedom to introduce instead an _",
    "explicit _ time dependence in the equations of motion of a dynamical system would provide too easy a way to influence more or less at will the asymptotic behavior of such a system .",
    "but of course the difference between _ autonomous _ and _ nonautonomous _ systems is unessential , since any _ nonautonomous _ system can be made _ autonomous _ by treating time itself as an additional dependent variable .    in this paper we focus on two mechanisms yielding ( autonomous )",
    "_ asymptotically isochronous _",
    "systems , and illustrate each of them via a representative example . the first example ( see section 2 ) belongs to a recently discovered class of _ integrable _ indeed _ solvable _ many - body problems @xcite ; in this case we eventually focus on as simple and specific an example as possible , which is also suitable to exhibit some numerical results ",
    "but we trust our presentation is adequate to illustrate the generality of the approach . in this case",
    "the periodic behavior prevailing asymptotically corresponds to a special solution of the dynamical system under consideration belonging to a region of phase space with _ positive _ codimension  albeit _ not _ an _ isolated _ solution of this system , so not quite identifiable as a _ limit cycle_. hence this model might be considered a representative example of a phenomenology characterized by the presence of some kind of friction .",
    "the second example ( see section 3 ) consists of a broad class of models obtained by deforming appropriately the well - known ( see for instance @xcite ) _ integrable _ and _ isochronous _ one - dimensional many - body problem with inverse - cube two - body forces and a one - body linear ( `` harmonic oscillator '' ) force ; the alert reader will again appreciate the generality of the approach , even though we illustrate it by focusing on a specific model ( also restricting consideration to _ real _ dependent variables ) . in this second case the time - dependent @xmath2-vector to which the solutions of the model tend _ asymptotically _ is _ not _ restricted to be in a sector of phase space with _ positive _ codimension and is generally _ not _ itself a solution of the _ asymptotically isochronous _ @xmath2-body model , so this phenomenology does not correspond to what is generally referred to as a _ limit cycle _ behavior . in each of these two cases",
    "we back the qualitative understanding of the origin of the relevant phenomenology with a _ proof _ of its actual emergence , see ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "a section entitled `` outlook '' in which we elaborate tersely on the generality of this phenomenology concludes the paper .",
    "a particular mechanism to manufacture _ integrable _ , indeed _",
    "solvable _ , dynamical systems interpretable as many - body problems inasmuch as they are characterized by newtonian equations of motion ( `` acceleration equal force '' ) was introduced about three decades ago @xcite and has been subsequently exploited to identify and investigate several such systems ( for reviews of these developments see for instance @xcite ) . the idea is to exploit the _ nonlinear _ relation among the @xmath2 coefficients @xmath13 of a ( for definiteness , monic ) time - dependent polynomial of degree @xmath2 and its @xmath2 zeros @xmath14 :    @xmath15 ~. \\label{psi}\\ ] ]    a class of such systems is characterized by the fact that the @xmath2 coefficients @xmath13 evolve in time according to a system of _ linear _ second - order _ constant - coefficient _ odes , the solution of which is a purely algebraic task ( requiring essentially the diagonalization of an explicitly known matrix of order @xmath2 ) . the determination of the corresponding time evolution of the @xmath2 zeros @xmath3 is therefore as well a purely algebraic task : computing the @xmath2 zeros of a known polynomial . and",
    "it so happens that in many cases @xcite this time evolution is indeed interpretable as that characterizing a newtonian @xmath2-body problem  hence a _ solvable _",
    "@xmath2-body problem , since its solution can be achieved by purely algebraic means .",
    "indeed the solution @xmath3 of such a model is reduced to finding the @xmath2 zeros of a polynomial of degree @xmath2 in the ( _ complex _ ) variable @xmath16 , see ( [ psi ] ) , whose coefficients @xmath13 generally evolve exponentially in time , typically@xmath17 + \\gamma ^{\\left",

    "note that these eigenvalues and eigenvectors are associated to the dynamical problem under consideration : they do _ not _ depend on the initial data identifying a particular solution , namely they are the _ same _ for all the solutions of the system .",
    "it is now clear ( and indeed well known @xcite ) that if the @xmath18 eigenvalues @xmath21 are all _ integer _ multiples of a single _ imaginary _ number @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 with the @xmath18 numbers @xmath26 arbitrary _ integers _ ( positive or negative , but not vanishing ) , then the polynomial @xmath27 is clearly _ periodic _ with the ( possibly nonprimitive ) period    @xmath28    @xmath29    hence all its zeros @xmath3 are as well _ periodic _ with this same period or possibly with a ( generally small @xcite ) _ integer",
    "_ multiple @xmath30 of this period , @xmath31 due to the possibility that they exchange their role through the time evolution .",

    "isochronous_.    and it is as well plain that if , out of the @xmath18 eigenvalues @xmath32 , only a ( nonempty ) subset have the property indicated above while _ all _ the others feature a _ negative _ real part , then the many - body problem in question is _ asymptotically isochronous_. this observation is not new , see for instance section 4.2.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( entitled `` some special cases : models with a limit cycle , models with confined and periodic motions , hamiltonian models , translation - invariant models , models featuring equilibrium and spiraling configurations , models featuring only completely periodic motions '' ) ; but , to the best of our knowledge , this mechanism yielding _ asymptotically isochronous _ many - body problems was never analyzed in explicit detail ( including the display of numerical results ) .",
    "this is what we do in this section , by focusing on a specific model whose _ integrable _ , indeed _ solvable _ , character has been ascertained only quite recently cg2007b .",

    "_ _  _ _ the technique to manufacture such generalized systems is clearly suggested by the examples treated above : of course these systems could be _ autonomous , _ as the examples treated above , or they might feature an _ explicit _ time - dependence , as could have been included in the system treated in section 3 by assuming the functions @xmath125 and @xmath170 to also feature an _ explicit _ time dependence ( but _ autonomous _ systems are generally more interesting than _ nonautonomous _ ones ) .",
    "often the natural context to investigate _ isochronous _ systems is in the _ complex _ rather than the _ real _ @xcite  although every system with _ complex _",
    "dependent variables can of course be reformulated as a system with twice as many _ real _ dependent variables .",
    "hence it may be of interest to mention how the findings detailed in section 3 would be affected if the dependent variables @xmath90 and @xmath100 in the model ( [ eqmot ] ) were allowed to be _ complex _  keeping of course _ real _ the time @xmath72 and _ positive _ the constant @xmath61 , while the constant @xmath98 could now also be _",
    "it is then well known @xcite that the _ isochronous _ character of the motions still prevails for the ( _ integrable _ indeed _ solvable _ ) many - body problem ( [ eqmota ] ) _ without _ the @xmath125 term ( i. e. , with an identically vanishing @xmath171 see ( [ eqmottilde ] ) )  describing motions taking place in the _ complex _ @xmath16-plane rather than on the _ real _ line .",
    "but in the _ complex _ context the _ isochronous _ behavior is a bit different than in the _ real _ context : the phase space is then divided into sectors separated by lower - dimensional manifolds characterized by solutions which hit a _ singularity _ at a finite time due to a particle collision ; an event forbidden in the _ real _ case with _ positive _ @xmath140 when the particles move on the _ real _ axis and the two - body force , _ singular _ at zero separation , is _ repulsive _ , see ( eqmota ) , but which can happen in the _ complex _ case , although not for _ generic _ initial data . in the different sectors",
    "the motion is still _ completely periodic _ , but with different periods , characterizing each sector and being ( generally rather small @xcite ) _ integer _ multiples of the basic period @xmath126 see ( [ t ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the _ generic _ solution of the ( generally _ nonintegrable _ ) generalized model ( [ eqmot ] ) will be _ nonsingular _ throughout its time evolution and it shall eventually settle within a sector , approaching asymptotically one of the _ completely periodic _ solutions in that sector of the ( _ integrable _ ) model ( [ eqmota ] ) with identically vanishing @xmath172        featuring @xmath174 different coupling constants @xmath175 acting among every particle pair .",
    "in this case the model without @xmath125 is generally _ not integrable _ , yet ( if considered in the _",
    "_ complex__@xmath176 namely without restricting the dependent variables @xmath93  nor , for that matter , the coupling constants @xmath175  to be _ real _ ) it still does feature an _",
    "open _ , hence fully dimensional , region in its phase space where _ all _ solutions are _ completely periodic _ with the same period @xmath67 , see ( [ t ] ) @xcite ; while in other regions of its phase space it might also be _ periodic _ but with periods @xmath177 where the numbers @xmath30 are _ integers _ but might be very large , or it might even display an _ aperiodic _ , quite complicated ( in some sense _ chaotic _ ) behavior @xcite ( for recent progress in the understanding of this phenomenology see @xcite ) .",
    "it then stands to reason that the solutions of the generalized model ( [ eqmot ] ) with ( [ eqmota ] ) replaced by ( [ eqmotgen ] ) ( and of course @xmath91 in ( [ eqmotb ] ) replaced by @xmath178 ) shall again approach asymptotically solutions  including , from _ open _ regions of initial data , _ completely periodic _ ones  of the model ( [ eqmotgen ] ) _ without _ @xmath125 : entailing a remarkable , and quite rich , phenomenology .",
    "clearly our motivation to mention this specific model is because of its prototypical role : indeed , the main aspects of this phenomenology shall also characterize the large class of _ isochronous _ ( but by no means necessarily _ integrable _ ) systems that can now be manufactured @xcite , once they are extended by adding to their equations of motion other , fairly general , terms having the property to disappear asymptotically ( as @xmath179 ) , as a consequence of the very dynamics implied by these extended equations of motion .    in conclusion",
    "let us re - emphasize that these results ( as indeed all mathematically correct findings ) might well be deemed remarkable or trivial , depending on the level of understanding of the reader .",
    "once their foundation is understood , it becomes obvious how they can be extended to many other models  suggesting an ample applicative potential .",
    "but these developments exceed the scope of this paper .",
