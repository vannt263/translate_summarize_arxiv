    "the frontier of high redshift galaxies and quasars has now reached a relatively large sample .",
    "hundreds of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) with colors consistent with @xmath0 have been detected in deep fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and tens of luminous quasars are known at @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the population of fainter active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is still elusive .",
    "partly , current surveys are not deep enough to detect them directly , and , partly , x - ray stacking of lbgs has led to no signal detected @xcite .",
    "searches for point sources in deep x - ray fields has also led to inconclusive results @xcite .    the x - ray non - detections have been used to estimate an upper limit on the black hole ( bh ) mass density at @xmath4 through an analog of soltan s argument @xcite , and on the luminosity a putative agn can have in these galaxies @xcite . with some assumptions on the eddington ratio ,",
    "this can be translated into an upper limit on the bh mass .",
    "the apparent result is that , if lbgs host bhs , they are accreting at low rate , or are less massive than expected on the basis of extrapolations of the correlation between bh mass and bulge mass at @xmath5 @xcite . however , it is far from clear if high - redshift lbgs have well developed bulges .",

    "the bh mass estimate is based on reverberation mapping or single - epoch virial estimates , the same technique used at higher redshift .",
    "likewise , their stellar mass measurements rely on mass - to - light ratios , as done on higher redshift samples .",
    "therefore they adopted the same methods used for mass measurements at higher redshift , where detailed information on stellar kinematics and bulge properties is not available .",
    "they found that the relation between bh mass and total stellar mass for moderate - luminosity agn , predominantly hosted by lower - mass galaxies , has a normalization that is approximately an order of magnitude lower than bh - bulge mass relations largely constrained at high mass .    in this paper",
    "we assess whether the lower normalization identified for the low - mass galaxies , typically lacking strong bulges , can explain the lack of an x - ray detection in the stack of lbgs .",
    "we couple galaxy stellar mass functions ( mfs ) with bh - stellar mass relations , and estimate the redshift evolution of the bh mass density and mf .",
    "we also take a complementary approach of coupling agn luminosity functions at @xmath7 with an empirical eddington ratio distribution , derived from the high - luminosity end of the luminosity function , to determine the bhmf .",
    "our approach resembles that taken by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we start by paraphrasing some text from a paper by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following convention : mbh masses are given by @xmath8 , the stellar mass is @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and the luminosity @xmath11 . given a galaxy mf , @xmath12 , and a function @xmath13 which gives the probability of finding a bh of mass @xmath14 in a galaxy of mass @xmath9 , the bhmf becomes : @xmath15 the integral of the bhmf then gives the mass density in bhs .",
    "similarly , the integral of the galaxy mf gives the stellar mass density .",
    "based on the empirical correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath9 : @xmath16 , with log - normal intrinsic scatter @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18    a similar approach links the agn luminosity function , @xmath19 , to the bhmf , through @xmath20 , the probability distribution of the logarithmic eddington ratio @xmath21 , recalling that @xmath22 , and a duty cycle , @xmath23 :    @xmath24    we consider here the @xmath25 at @xmath7 derived by @xcite , starting from the quasar luminosity function by @xcite , with @xmath20 , fitted on the sample of @xmath26 quasars with estimated bh mass , described by a lognormal distribution with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , a fraction of agn are obscured , and they are missed by observations .",
    "we include a luminosity dependent correction for obscuration based on @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite limit their redshift evolution to @xmath30 .",
    "they found that the fraction of obscured quasars increases with redshift , but , conservatively , we keep the @xmath31 value even at higher redshift .    .",
    "in this work we adopt the mf by @xcite at @xmath32 , and the mf by @xcite at @xmath33 . however , it is important to keep in mind the spread in the observational determination as an important source of uncertainty in our results . [",
    "fig : rhogal],width=336 ]      several different measurements and analytical fits to the galaxy stellar mf can be found in the literature .",
    "many of them are summarized in @xcite and @xcite , where differences and uncertainties are discussed ( see fig.11 in madau & dickinson 2014 ) .",
    "we will further discuss this in section 3 .",
    "we start from the galaxy mf of @xcite .",
    "we use their best fit parameters for the full sample , and the fit for  quiescent \" galaxies as a proxy for elliptical galaxies . at @xmath34",
    "we consider four galaxy mfs : @xcite , plus the correction for nebular lines proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , all converted to a chabrier initial mf for consistency with rv15 . the stellar mass density for the various mfs obtained by integration for stellar masses @xmath35 is shown in fig .  [ fig : rhogal ] . in the following we will use as a reference the mf by @xcite as  middle ground \" , and discuss how results change using other mfs .",
    "we adopt three different functional forms for the scaling between bh mass and galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the first is a simple linear scaling , so that the bh mass is @xmath36 the stellar mass : @xmath37 as often done in the literature , by extrapolating the bh - bulge mass relation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is our  vanilla \" model .",
    "we also include the two total stellar mass relationships found by rv15 for ellipticals and bulges , typically with high stellar masses : @xmath38 and for moderate - luminosity agns , typically in lower - mass host galaxies : @xmath39     highmass \" and  lowmass \" fits hereafter .",
    "both these relationships have an intrinsic scatter @xmath40 dex .",
    "in what follows we will adopt a scatter of 0.5 dex for all scalings as a reference and then discuss the effect of a tighter or broader scatter .",

    "we report all the current upper limits , derived either on deep x - ray observations @xcite or from the integrated x - ray background @xcite .",
    "these upper limits do not include compton thick agn , so that in reality there may be a fraction of bhs not accounted for .",
    "we also stress that soltan s argument estimates the mass density accreted in luminous phases throughout cosmic time up to @xmath2 .",
    "the total mass density can be higher when accounting for non - radiative bh growth , e.g. via mergers , radiatively inefficient accretion or heavily obscured accretion episodes , and when including inactive bhs .",

    ", there is a general consensus : taking the full mf of @xcite , and assuming the vanilla fit , or including quiescent galaxies only and fit highmass give similar results .",
    "the reason is that , while the mass in galaxies locked in quiescent galaxies is about half of the total stellar mass density , the bh mass locked in elliptical galaxies dominates the full population because bhs represent a higher fraction of their stellar mass . using the lowmass fit only , instead",
    ", leads to an underestimate of the total bh mass density .",
    "results become more interesting at higher redshift .",
    "firstly , the fraction of stellar mass in quiescent galaxies drops significantly .",
    "therefore , even considering that bhs represent a larger fraction of the stellar mass in ellipticals , the global contribution to the bh mass density falls . therefore ,",
    "if bhs require a bulge component , bhs represent a higher fraction of the stellar mass of the bulge at increasing redshift .",
    "secondly , for the full population , the mass density in bhs is always above the limits imposed by lack of x - ray detections in stacking of high - z galaxies , except for the lowmass fit , i.e. , for the other fits to hold , x - ray limits imply most of the bh mass density was not accreted in a luminous phase .",
    "increasing the scatter only increases the bh mass density @xcite . even reducing the scatter to zero , however , the vanilla or highmass fits overestimate @xmath57 given by the observational constraints at high-@xmath2 .",
    "bhs represent a smaller fraction of the stellar mass of the galaxy at higher redshift , and/or local moderate - luminosity agn are good proxies for the bh - to - host relationship at high-@xmath2 .",
    "a combination of the lowmass and highmass fit (  hybrid \" ) , using @xmath58 as dividing line ( rv15 ) , provides a reasonable evolution of the mass density at all redshifts , with only a slight tension with most upper limits at @xmath0 . for the same @xmath59 relation of eq .",

    "the choice of the scaling relation has clear consequences for the derived bh mass density . at low redshift",
