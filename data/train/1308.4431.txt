    "@xmath108 case is excluded because @xmath109 . from the construction of graph @xmath77 it follows , that all vertices have a degree @xmath110 , except for four vertices , which have degree @xmath111 , namely @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . therefore , @xmath77 consists of several even cycles ( as it is bipartite ) and 2 simple paths .",

    "we split the edges of @xmath116 into two groups .",
    "first group contains edges of type @xmath122 and @xmath123 and second group contains the remaining edges . note that each edge of the path @xmath116 has only neighbors from the other group .",

    "moving along the vertical edges does not change the abscissa .",

    "moreover , @xmath129 , so we have @xmath130 .",
    "the path @xmath116 has no edges , which is a contradiction .    if @xmath131 then @xmath3 is not interval colorable .",
    "suppose , to the contrary , that @xmath132 and @xmath133 is an interval - edge coloring of @xmath3 .",
    "we call an edge @xmath134 a `` @xmath135-edge '' if @xmath136 for some @xmath137 .",
    "we denote by @xmath138 the number of @xmath135-edges incident to the vertex @xmath139 .    without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath140 ( otherwise we will shift the colors of all edges by the same amount in a way that the spectrum of vertex @xmath71 starts with color @xmath111 ) .",

    "@xmath147 this is a contradiction , because @xmath148 is an odd number .",
    "there are two natural `` next steps '' after finding the condition for colorability of @xmath3 .",
    "first one is to find the exact number of colors needed to color @xmath3 and the second is to generalize the statement to colorability of @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
