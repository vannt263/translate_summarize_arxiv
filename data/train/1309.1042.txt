    "graphene,@xcite a two - dimensional single layer of carbon atoms packed into a honeycomb lattice , has aroused enormous interest in recent years due to its intriguing properties.@xcite particular efforts have been devoted into the graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs),@xcite quasi one dimension ribbon like structures resulted from the finite termination of the graphene with two different possible edge geometries , namely armchairs and zigzags . since gnrs have a tunable band gap sensitive to the size and geometry , they are good candidates for the possible electronic and spintronic devices , such as the field effect transistor,@xcite the spin filter and spin transistor.@xcite to realize these devices , it is required to manipulate the transport through the gnrs in a controllable manner . among various schemes , to modulate the transport using different shapes of gnrs , e.g. , u - shaped , s - shaped , and t - shaped are of particular interest.@xcite    in the t - shaped gnrs , the possible ( quasi-)bound states trapped at the intersection due to the t - shaped confinement@xcite provides another channel to modulate the transport through the fano effect,@xcite which stems from the interference between the path through a discrete state and the path through a continuum when the discrete state embeds in the continuum .",
    "the localized states in t - shaped structures composed of the conventional semiconductor quantum wires have long been studied.@xcite it is shown that there is one bound state lying below and one quasi - bound state embedding in the lowest conduction band .",
    "the existence of the quasi - bound state results in the asymmetrical dip in the energy dependence of the conductance , which is the character of the fano effect.@xcite since the gnrs have much more complex band structures which strongly depend on the geometry and ribbon size,@xcite the t - shaped structures consists of gnrs are expected to have more complex behaviors .",
    "recently , the quasi - bound states are shown to play an important role in the transport through the zigzag gnr in the t - shaped gnr structure consisting of a zigzag gnr connected to an armchair sidearm.@xcite however , in the t - shaped gnr structure consisting of a metallic armchair gnr connected to a zigzag sidearm , which is more interesting for transport since the lowest excitations in the gapless armchair gnrs are massless dirac fermions whose spectrum is linear with the momentum , the existence of the ( quasi)-bound states have not yet been studied . if the ( quasi-)bound states exist , they have to embed in the continuum due to the gapless band structures of both the armchair gnr and the zigzag sidearm .",
    "therefore , these states are expected to greatly affect the transport of the dirac fermions through the armchair gnr through the fano effect .    in this work",

    ". the localized components of the quasi - bound states , whose energy is below the second sub - band edges , mainly come from the second sub - band of the gnrs.@xcite therefore , the probable condition for the quasi - bound state to exist is when the second sub - band edges of both the armchair gnr and the zigzag sidearm are comparable . in our setup the optimal condition for the quasi - bound states which is when @xmath0 is about @xmath29 , as it can be seen from table  [ table1 ] .",
