    "coulomb excitation of two - phonon giant resonances in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies was predicted by baur and bertulani in 1986 @xcite and generated considerable interest during the last few years @xcite .",
    "the double giant isovector dipole resonance ( dgdr ) has now been observed in several nuclei : @xmath1xe @xcite , @xmath2 au @xcite , and @xmath3pb @xcite .",
    "the double giant isoscalar quadrupole resonance has been also observed in the @xmath4 reaction , at @xmath5 mev laboratory energy @xcite .",
    "data on the dgdr were confronted with results of coupled channels coulomb excitation theory @xcite and the major conclusion reached was that theoretical predictions underestimate the data by a factor 2 - 3 in the cases of @xmath1xe and @xmath2au . a similar discrepancy , albeit appreciably smaller , was found in @xmath3pb @xcite .",
    "several effects , not taken into account in the coupled channel theory , were considered to explain this discrepancy . among these are anharmonicities @xcite and the brink - axel mechanism @xcite , to cite a few . in this paper",
    "we examine the relevance of isospin effects in the excitation process relying on the pioneering work of fallieros , in which the isospin splitting of the isovector giant dipole resonance was first analyzed @xcite .",
    "we next present an extension of this work to the double giant isovector dipole states @xcite , before turning to more technical details of the coupled channels calculation .",
    "the relevant dipole excitation operator is the component @xmath6 of an isovector ( @xmath7 ) operator , @xmath8 .",
    "thus , when acting on a target nucleus with isospin quantum numbers @xmath9 , @xmath10 , two gdr states will be generated having isospin quantum numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is forbidden due to charge conservation ) , where the label @xmath14 has been introduced to designate the ( intermediate ) one - phonon state .",
    "if the dipole operator is applied again to these one - phonon states , final states with isospin @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be generated . in order to take into account the bosonic nature of isovector phonons in these final states",
    ", one must keep track of another isospin quantum number , namely the _ total _",
    "isospin @xmath17 of the _ two _ dipole phonon operator , which can take the values @xmath18 these values will constrain the total angular momentum of the two coupled phonons through symmetry requirements . for a nucleus with @xmath19 ground state",
    ", the dgdr may have @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and for the state @xmath22 one must have @xmath23 .",
    "if isospin is not taken into account , @xmath22 states , reached from the @xmath24 gdr , will be quenched @xcite , since by itself it is antisymmetric under exchange of the two phonons .",
    "however , @xmath22 states will in general contribute to the excitation cross section , if explicit reference to its @xmath23 nature is made . in this case",
    ", the exchange symmetry is odd both in the spin and isospin spaces , so that the product has even symmetry , as required .",
    "the energy splitting of the isodoublet gdr was studied in @xcite and was found to be related to the symmetry energy and to the average particle - hole interaction , leading to the estimate    @xmath25\\;.   \\label{fall1}\\ ] ]    the energy splitting of the isotriplet dgdr can be estimated in a similar way . since the @xmath26 state is a double isospin analog state it involves twice the displacement energy , and we may write    @xmath27\\;.   \\label{fall2}\\ ] ]    furthermore , for the @xmath28 state we may write    @xmath29\\;.   \\label{fall3}\\ ] ]    we give in table i the energies of the isospin doublet and triplet states in @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) as obtained from these expressions .

    "in this paper isospin is taken into account in the excitation of the double giant dipole resonance .",
    "we have used a semiclassical coupled - channels formalism to calculate excitation probabilities and cross sections for the collisions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we have assumed that the eletromagnetic matrix elements are isospin independent and adopted the isospin splitting of energy levels as given by akyz and fallieros @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that isospin leads to a redistribution of the strengths of the electromagnetic matrix elements such that the probability for coulomb excitation of @xmath37 dgdr states is enhanced .",
    "this enhancement depends on 3j and 6j coefficients in isospin space so that it becomes more relevant for nuclei with low ground state isospin . consequently , this effect turned out to be much stronger in the excitation of @xmath38 than in the excitation of @xmath39 .",
    "one should then expect that isospin splitting should contribute to make de dgdr broader , particularly for nuclei with low ground state isospin .",
    "this result suggests that our formalism should be especially relevant to study the excitation cross sections of a family of isotopes with charge numbers varying from the proton to the neutron dripline .",
    "study along these directions is underway .",
