    "* proposition 4.1 ) for minuscule homogeneous spaces @xmath70 is given in terms of the minuscule poset @xmath127 as follows @xmath116 * [ x(w ) ] =   \\sum_{w \\text { covers } w ' } [ x(w ' ) ] + q [ x(w)]^{\\mathrm{pd}},\\ ] ] where @xmath508 is the quantum parameter and @xmath509^{\\mathrm{pd}}$ ] denotes the poincar dual of @xmath509 $ ] , whose minuscule poset corresponds to the order dual of @xmath510 .",
    "of course the limit @xmath511 coincides with the classical chevalley formula in remark [ rem : minuscule ] . from this formula",
    ", we can calculate the quantum differential system of minuscule @xmath70 and reduce this first order system to a higher order differential system by some computer aided calculation ( see @xcite @xcite for instance ) .",
    "for example , the orthogonal grassmannian @xmath512 and the cayley plane @xmath1 have the quantum differential operator annihilating the component associated with the fundamental class as follows : @xmath513 @xmath514 respectively , where @xmath515 . by the quantum hyperplane section theorem for homogeneous spaces",
    "@xcite , we can determine the genus zero gromov ",
    "witten potential for each example of calabi  yau complete intersections in minuscule @xmath70 .",
    "in fact this procedure also works for general rational homogeneous spaces @xmath70 by replacing the above quantum chevalley formula by the general one obtained in @xcite though we do not go into the specifics here .    on the other hand , we already know the conjectural mirror family . hence comparing both sides , we can prove the classical genus zero ` mirror theorem ' @xcite @xcite for these examples combining conjecture [ conj : mirror ] .",
