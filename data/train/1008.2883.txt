    "<S> we study the @xmath0-meson spectral function in hot nuclear matter by taking into account the isospin - symmetric pion and the nucleon loops within the quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) model as well as using an effective chiral su(3 ) model . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral function of the @xmath1 meson is studied in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) as well as in the relativistic hartree ( rha ) approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the nucleon loop considerably changes the @xmath0-meson spectral function . due to a larger mass drop of @xmath1 meson in the rha </S>",
    "<S> , it is seen that the spectral function shifts towards the low invariant mass region , whereas in the mfa the spectral function is seen to be slightly shifted towards the high mass region . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while the spectral function is observed to be sharper with the nucleon - antinucleon polarization in rha , the spectral function is seen to be broader in the mfa .    </S>",
