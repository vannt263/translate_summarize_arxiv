    "the sequence of evolution of the  region around a star with a strong ionising radiation field which turns on rapidly is well known ( kahn 1954 ; goldsworthy 1961 ; see also spitzer 1978 , osterbrock 1989 or dyson & williams 1997 ) .",
    "initially , the ionization front ( if ) between ionized and neutral gas moves outwards at a speed limited by the supply of ionizing photons , but it begins to decelerate as the ionizing flux at the front surface is cut by geometrical divergence and absorption by recombined atoms within the front . eventually , when the speed of the front decreases to roughly twice the sound speed in the ( now highly overpressured ) ionized gas , a shock is driven forwards into the neutral gas ahead of the front .",
    "before this stage , the front is referred to as r - type , while subsequently it is referred to as d - type .",
    "the shock propagates outwards , gradually weakening , until , in principle , the  region eventually reaches pressure equilibrium with its surroundings .    where the external medium has an ordered magnetic field , the obvious critical flow speeds are the fast , alfvn and slow speeds rather than the isothermal sound speed .",
    "redman  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , hereafter ) studied ifs with the magnetic field vector in the plane of the front , and found that the fast - mode speed plays the same role as the sound speed does in the hydrodynamic case . in this paper , we extend their work to treat the case of an if moving into a medium in which the magnetic field is oblique to the direction of propagation of the front ( note also we here follow the more conventional usage in which the magnetic fields are termed parallel or perpendicular with respect to the front - normal ) .",
    "jump conditions for ifs with oblique magnetization have previously been studied by lasker  .",
    "here we consider a wider range of upstream magnetic fields , since observations have shown that higher magnetic fields are found around  regions than once thought likely @xcite .",
    "we determine the properties of the jumps as functions of upstream conditions , using the velocity of the front as a parameter rather than as the variable for which we solve .",
    "we use evolutionary conditions to isolate the stable if solutions , and verify these conclusions for a simple model of the internal structure of the fronts and using numerical simulations . we find that rather weak parallel magnetic fields can lead to a substantial decrease in the d - critical (  photoevaporation ) velocity from dense clumps except where the magnetic field is exactly parallel to the if , and",
    "also find additional solutions to the jump conditions in the range of front velocities forbidden by the hydrodynamical jump conditions , which were not considered by lasker .    in the following sections , we present the jump conditions for mhd shocks ( section  [ s : jump ] ) , and discuss the regions for which evolutionary conditions suggest that these solutions are stable ( section  [ s : solns ] ) .",
    "we verify that the evolutionary solutions are those with resolved internal structures for one simple model for the internal structure of the fronts ( section  [ s : resolv ] ) . in the context of these results ,",
    "we discuss the development of an if over time ( section  [ s : devel ] ) and illustrate this development using numerical models ( section  [ s : numeric ] ) .    finally ( in section  [ s : concl ] ) , we summarize our results , and provide an example of their application to observations of the region s106 .",
    "our physical interpretation of the development of mhd ifs will , we hope , facilitate the future application of these results .",
    "we orient axes so that @xmath2 is normal to the front , and ( without loss of generality ) that the upstream velocity and magnetic field are in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "we use the usual mhd jump conditions : @xmath4&= & 0 \\\\ { } [ \\rho v_z^2 + p + b_x^2/8\\pi ] & = & 0 \\\\ { } [ \\rho v_z v_x - b_z b_x/4\\pi ] & = & 0 \\\\ { } [ b_z ] & = & 0 \\\\ { } [ v_x b_z - v_z b_x ] & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] except that instead of using the energy flux condition , we adopt the isothermal equation of state @xmath5 where the sound speed , @xmath6 , increases across the front but is constant on either side of it .",
    "we use subscripts 1 and 2 to denote upstream and downstream parameters , respectively , and write @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . hence @xmath11 equations , and give @xmath12 where @xmath13 and we define @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the @xmath16 and @xmath17 contributions to the reciprocal of the plasma beta ) .",
    "the dependence on the upstream transverse velocity has disappeared , as expected as a result of frame - invariance .    in equation , we substitute with for @xmath18 and use equation to eliminate @xmath19 and @xmath20 to find that , so long as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the dilution factor @xmath23 is given by the quartic equation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is a typical value ) .",
    "it is easily verified that this equation has the correct form in the obvious limiting cases ( of isothermal mhd shocks where @xmath27 , and perpendicular - magnetized ifs where @xmath28 , see paper i ) .",
    "= 8 cm    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     equation   relates the dilution factor , @xmath23 , to the upstream properties of the flow .",
    "its roots can be found by standard techniques .",
    "if the flow is to have a unique solution based only on initial and boundary conditions , then some of these roots must be excluded .",
    "it is possible to exclude roots on the basis that they correspond to flows that do not satisfy an evolutionary condition , analogous to that long used in the study of mhd shocks .",
    "the evolutionary condition is based on the requirement that the number of unknowns in the jump conditions matches the number of constraints applied to the flow @xcite . for mhd shocks ,",
    "the number of characteristics entering the shock must be two greater than the number leaving it ( since the number of independent shock equations is equal to the number of conserved variables and if there are no internal constraints on the front structure ) .",
    "the applicability of the evolutionary conditions to mhd shocks has been the subject of controversy in the recent past @xcite , with various authors suggesting that intermediate shocks (  shocks which take the flow from super- to sub - alfvn speeds ) may be stable .",
    "however , falle & komissarov   have shown that the non - evolutionary solutions are only stable when the symmetry is artificially constrained , so that the magnetic fields ahead of and behind the shocks are precisely coplanar . in any cases in which the boundary conditions differed from this special symmetry ,",
    "the solutions including non - evolutionary shocks were found to be unstable .",
    "the equations governing the dynamics across an if are no longer a system of hyperbolic conservation laws , since the ionization source term can not be neglected on the scale of the front .",
    "it seems reasonable to apply analogous evolutionary and uniqueness conditions , but the mathematical proofs for hyperbolic conservation laws with dissipation @xcite no longer apply .",
    "the ` strong ' evolutionary conditions suggest that for if the number of incoming characteristics is equal to the number of outgoing characteristics , since applying the ionization equation means that there is an additional constraint on the velocity of the front .",
    "solutions which are under - specified by the external characteristic constraints , termed ` weakly evolutionary ' , may occur if there are internal constraints , as is the case for strong d - type ifs in hydrodynamics .",
    "stable weakly evolutionary solutions only occur for limited classes of upstream parameters which depend on the internal structure of the fronts . where the number of characteristics entering the front is greater than suggested by the evolutionary conditions , the solution can be realized as an mhd shock leading or trailing an evolutionary if .    in the limit in which @xmath29 tends to unity from above , the phase change through the if has no dynamical consequences , and the if jump conditions approach those for isothermal mhd shocks .",
    "this can be seen if we rewrite equation   as @xmath30 \\nonumber\\\\ \\hfill= -(\\alpha-1)[m^2\\delta-2\\eta]^2.\\label{e : opoly}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the if solution which satisfies the strong evolutionary conditions becomes the trivial ( @xmath31 ) solution of the mhd jump condition .",
    "the other solutions to the if jump conditions become non - evolutionary or evolutionary isothermal mhd shocks .",
    "the analysis of falle & komissarov   rules out the former as physical solutions .",
    "the latter are treatable as separate discontinuities , which will propagate away from the if when the flow is perturbed , since the coincidence between the speeds of the shock and of the if will be broken .",
    "this argument by continuity supports the use of the evolutionary conditions for ifs .    as a result of this discussion ,",
    "we will proceed for the present to isolate solutions in which the number of characteristics entering an if is equal to the number leaving it ( and discuss in section  [ s : resolv ] the weakly evolutionary solutions for a simplified model of the internal structure of ifs ) .",
    "the velocity of fronts obeying the strong evolutionary conditions must be between the same critical speeds in the upstream and downstream gas ( somewhat confusingly , the fronts which obey the strong evolutionary conditions are termed ` weak ' in the standard nomenclature of detonations and ifs ) .",
    "we follow the usual classification of flow speeds relative to the fast , alfvn and slow mode speeds @xmath32 , so the allowed fronts are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . by analogy with the nomenclature of non - magnetized if , we call these fast - r , fast - d , slow - r and slow - d type if , respectively .    the panels of fig .",
    "[ f : crit ] show regions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 space corresponding to evolutionary mhd ifs for several values of @xmath39 . in the figures , we see regions corresponding to the two distinct classes of r- and d - type solutions .",
    "the flows into the r - type fronts are super - fast or super - slow , while those into the d - type fronts are sub - fast or sub - slow . at the edges of the regions of solutions",
    "either the velocity into the front is the alfvn speed or the exit velocity from the front is equal to a characteristic speed (  the fast mode speed at the edge of the fast - r region , etc . ) . for comparison ,",
    "the solid lines on these plots show the edges of the forbidden region for perpendicular magnetization ( @xmath28 , see paper i ) : these lines reach @xmath40 at the edges of the forbidden region for unmagnetized if , @xmath41 .",
    "since equation   is a cubic in @xmath42 , quadratic in @xmath39 and linear in @xmath29 and @xmath38 , there is no simple analytic form for the boundaries of the regions .",
    "however , certain critical values can be determined analytically . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the slow - r - critical line terminates where it hits the alfvn speed at @xmath44 , while the position at which the fast d - critical line terminates is given by @xmath45 these points are linked , respectively , by steady switch - off and switch - on shocks to the points on the limiting slow - d and fast - r critical loci at which these loci hit the axis @xmath40 .",
    "the intercept between the slow - d critical locus and the axis is at @xmath46 for @xmath47 , beyond which the limiting value is @xmath48 as for d - critical hydrodynamic if . to illustrate the reason for this change in solution",
    ", we rewrite equation   for @xmath40 as @xmath49 the flow leaving a front with no upstream perpendicular component of magnetic field can be either at the alfvn speed or at the velocity of the corresponding non - magnetized if .",
    "where the flow is in the region beyond the edge of the slow - d - critical region shown in figure  [ f : crit ] ( a ) or ( b ) , the root of equation   for flow out at the alfvn speed is not a real solution , since satisfying equation   would require that @xmath50 .",
    "even for as small a ratio between magnetic and thermal energy upstream of the front as implied by @xmath51 , the effect of parallel magnetization on the slow - d - critical velocity is dramatic .",
    "only once @xmath52 ( so the alfvn speed in the upstream gas is below the unmagnetized d - critical speed ) does the fast - critical locus reach @xmath40 , so that the parallel magnetization may be ignored . as @xmath39 increases , the vertical line at the alfvn speed moves across the plot ( see figure  [ f : crit ] ) , decreasing the region of fast - mode ifs and increasing that of slow - mode ifs . when @xmath53 ( a very strong parallel magnetic field ) , the ( slow - mode ) forbidden region is identical to that in the unmagnetized case ( independent of @xmath38 ) .",
    "if the upstream flow is at the alfvn velocity , @xmath54 , then the physical solution ( when due care is taken with the singularity of equation  ) is often at @xmath55 , the ionization of the gas does not change the flow density and it remains at the alfvn speed .",
    "both classes of d - type front have @xmath56 ( rarefy the gas ) , while both classes of r - type have @xmath57 ( compress it ) . the perpendicular component of the magnetic field , @xmath58 , increases in a fast - r- or slow - d - type if , while it decreases in a fast - d- or slow - r - type .",
    "we will now study the internal structure of the fronts for one simple model .",
    "up to now we have assumed , by investigating the jump conditions , that the processes within the if take place on scales far smaller than those of interest for the global flow problem .",
    "in fact , the flow structure within an ionization front will vary smoothly on scales comparable to the ionization distance in the neutral gas .",
    "the flow may take several recombination lengths behind the front to relax to equilibrium . here",
    "we describe the internal structure of mhd if in one simple approximation , that the temperature of the gas varies smoothly through the front but the flow obeys the inviscid mhd equations throughout ( * ? ? ?",
    "* as used in the study of hydrodynamic if structure by ) .",
    "we shall see that , in this approximation , only fronts obeying the evolutionary conditions can have smooth structures . for the structures to be generic , the jumps across them must satisfy the strong evolutionary conditions , although singular classes of weakly evolutionary fronts with internal constraints on their flow structures are also possible .",
    "= 8 cm    in this model the form of an if is given by the variation of the roots of equation   with the temperature of the gas , specified by @xmath29 .",
    "the left hand side of this equation is a quartic independent of @xmath29 , which is positive at @xmath59 and zero at @xmath55 , and has two or four positive roots ( * ? ? ?",
    "* since the condition that its value is zero is the normal mhd shock condition for isothermal gas , ) .",
    "the right hand side is a quadratic , which is zero at @xmath60 and depends on @xmath29 through its ( negative ) scale .",
    "if the value of @xmath29 increases steadily through the front , the manner in which the solutions vary can be followed , as illustrated by the schematic plot , fig .",
    "[ f : schema ] .    for the upstream conditions ( @xmath27 )",
    ", there will be either two or four solutions where the quartic curve crosses the axis .",
    "of these , one is the trivial solution , @xmath55 , and at most one corresponds to an evolutionary shock .    when internal heating occurs in an if , the solutions at a given @xmath29 correspond to where the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ f : schema ] crosses the corresponding dashed curve , @xmath61 . if gas enters the if at the point marked @xmath62 , in region 2 between the alfvn speed and the fast mode speed , then it can move following the arrow as @xmath29 increases . for sufficiently large @xmath29 ,",
    "the dashed curve becomes tangent to the solid curve : when this occurs , the gas is moving at the slow- or fast - mode speed , and the if is called a critical front . in between the initial and final solutions , smooth , steady if solutions must remain between the same characteristic speeds as they were when they started .",
    "the strong evolutionary conditions give just those cases in which a front structure calculated for a smoothly varying , monotonically increasing @xmath29 ( and non - zero perpendicular magnetic field ) has a continuous solution from the upstream to the downstream case .    when the upstream flow is at the fast or the slow critical speed , the l.h.s",
    ".  of equation   has a second root @xmath55 .",
    "thus for @xmath63 , this pair of roots disappears , and a forbidden region is generated .",
    "for @xmath64 there is no forbidden region .    for any @xmath29 , the points where the solid curve crosses the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ f : schema ] are related to each other by the isothermal mhd shock jump conditions , so a steady shock can form anywhere within the if structure for identical upstream and downstream conditions . however , since such a flow is over - specified , the equality of the speed between the shock and if is a coincidence which will be broken by any perturbation of the flow ( in which case the shock will escape from one or other side of the if ) .",
    "this situation is in direct analogy with strong r - type ifs in unmagnetized flows .",
    "strong d - type fronts , for which the exhaust leaves the front rather above the critical speed , can occur where the heating is not monotonic . for these",
    ", the highest temperature is attained when the flow is at the critical speed (  the curves in figure  [ f : schema ] become tangent exactly at the highest value of @xmath29 ) , and as it subsequently cools the solution can move back up the other branch .",
    "these fronts will form a more restrictive limiting envelope on the allowed weak solutions than that given by the critical solutions .",
    "the evolutionary conditions are necessary but not sufficient , so this behaviour would be expected when more detailed physics was included .",
    "the actual envelope will correspond to the case for critical fronts with exhausts at the highest temperature attained within the front . since unmagnetized",
    "if models suggest that any overshoot in the temperature of the gas is likely to be small , the envelope will probably not differ greatly from that found for critical solutions , although the transonic nature of these fronts can be important in determining the structure of global flows .",
    "equation   suggests that no mhd flow can pass through the alfvn velocity ( where @xmath65 ) in a front unless it has zero perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "heating the gas will generally move the flow in regions 2 and 3 away from the alfvn speed in any case ( see figures  [ f : schema ] and [ f : cusp ] ) .",
    "however , where the perpendicular magnetic field _ is _ zero , a smooth , weakly evolutionary , front structure can be found ( the internal constraint being zero perpendicular magnetic field ) .",
    "the internal structure will be identical to an unmagnetized if .",
    "indeed , the strong - d hydrodynamic front can become , by analogy , an ` extra - strong ' front which passes through both the alfvn and sound speeds ( for zero perpendicular field , the slow and fast velocities are each equal to one of these ) .",
    "by analogy with equation  , the @xmath66-components of velocity and magnetic field are zero everywhere if the mhd equations apply throughout the front ( except if it were to pass through the alfvn velocity ) .",
    "components in these directions _ can _ be generated if the velocity coupling between different components of the fluid  electrons , ions , neutrals or dust  is not perfect ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* as in shock structures , ) .",
    "these components must , however , damp at large enough scales : far beyond the front the magnetic field must be in the same plane and of the same sign as the upstream field , from the evolutionary conditions .",
    "exactly this behaviour has been found to occur in time - dependent multifluid models of mhd shocks ( falle , private communication ) .",
    "a full treatment of ionization fronts in multicomponent material is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this section , we discuss the development of the if in a magnetized  region , by combining the well - understood development of if in unmagnetized environments with the classes of physical roots of equation   found above .",
    "an if driven into finite density gas from a source which turns on instantaneously will start at a velocity greater than the fast - r - critical velocity . unless the density decreases rapidly away from the source , the speed of the front decreases so that eventually the ionized gas exhaust is at the fast - mode speed ( at the fast - r - critical velocity ) .",
    "when this occurs , two roots of equation   merge , and become complex for smaller @xmath37 . as a result , the front will then have to undergo a transition of some sort .",
    "as in the unmagnetized case @xcite , if the size of the ionized region is large compared to the lengthscales which characterise the internal structures of shocks and ifs , the if will evolve through emitting ( one or more ) shocks . the evolution of an initial if discontinuity can be treated as a modified riemann problem because the speed of the if is determined by the flow properties on either side of it , together with the incident ionizing flux which we assume varies slowly .",
    "the development of this modified riemann problem will be self - similar , just as for conventional riemann problems .",
    "one complication is that the if may be located within a rarefaction wave , but this does not occur for the circumstances we discuss in the present section .",
    "the simplest possibility for a slowing fast - r - critical if is that it will become fast - d - type by emitting a single fast - mode shock .",
    "this has obvious limits to the cases where the magnetization is zero ( where the shock is a normal hydrodynamic shock ) , and where it is purely perpendicular .",
    "if the speed of the if is specified by the mass flux through it , then the leading shock driven into the surrounding neutral gas must be a fast - mode shock , since the upstream neutral gas must still be advected into the combined structure at more than the alfvn speed after the transition , and so only a fast - mode shock can escape .    while there may be no fast - d - type solutions at the value of @xmath38 which applied for the fast - r - type front",
    ", the fast - mode shock moving ahead will act to increase the value of @xmath67 upstream of the if , since the ( squared ) increase in the perpendicular component of the magnetic field dominates over the increase in the gas density after the shock . at fast - r - criticality , there is in general a second solution with the same upstream and downstream states in which a fast - mode shock leads a fast - d - critical if , because the l.h.s .  of equation   (",
    "for which a zero value implies an isothermal shock solution ) is positive for large @xmath23 and for post shock flow at the alfvn speed (  @xmath68 ) , unless the flow into the front is at the alfvn velocity , or @xmath39 or @xmath38 is zero . for example , for a downstream state @xmath69 , there are two evolutionary solutions : a @xmath33 front with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and a @xmath34 front with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "figure  [ f : crit ] parts ( c ) and",
    "( b ) , respectively , contain points which correspond to these solutions .",
    "these two upstream states are linked by a fast - mode shock with the same velocity as the if .",
    "thus the emission of a single fast - mode shock is a valid solution of the modified riemann problem which occurs as the flow passes through criticality _ whatever _ the internal structure of the shock and if , so long as the evolutionary shocks and ifs exist .",
    "( since the l.h.s .  of equation   is greater than zero so long as @xmath78 for @xmath79 , an equivalent argument holds for slow - critical transitions . )",
    "it is possible that further waves may be emitted at the transition , for instance a slow - mode shock into the neutral gas together with a slow - mode rarefaction into the ionized gas . for the model resolved",
    "if , this seems unlikely to occur unless the flow velocity reaches the slow - mode speed somewhere within the fast - d - critical if .",
    "these other solutions are not seen in our numerical simulations below .",
    "additional solutions would also make the development of the if non - unique , if the simpler possibility is allowed .",
    "the fast - critical transition may be followed using the jump conditions for a front with its exhaust at the fast - mode speed (  a fast - critical front ) . in the smoothly - varying @xmath29 model of section  [",
    "s : resolv ] , the upstream and downstream states can be joined by a front in which an isothermal mhd shock is at rest in the if frame _ anywhere _ within the if structure , since the quantities conserved through the front are also conserved by the shock .",
    "the evolution of an if through criticality will occur by an infinitesimally - weak fast - mode wave at the exhaust of the if moving forward through its structure and strengthening until it eventually escapes into the neutral gas as an independent shock ( * ? ? ?",
    "* as illustrated for recombination fronts by ) .",
    "the escaping fast - mode shock leads to a near - perpendicular field configuration upstream of the if .",
    "this boost in the perpendicular component is required if the transition is to proceed though the fast - d type solutions , which , as figure  [ f : crit ] illustrates , are near - perpendicular ( large @xmath38 ) except where @xmath80 is very large or very small .",
    "this will result in a rapid change in downstream parameters across a front where the upstream field is nearly parallel to the if .",
    "as an example , the flow downstream of the if will either converge onto or diverge from lines where the upstream magnetic field is parallel to the ionization front , and as a result may produce inhomogeneities in the structure of  regions on various scales ( from bipolarity to clumps ) .",
    "= 8 cm    as the velocity of the front decreases further , eventually it will approach the alfvn speed .",

    "the upstream ( neutral ) gas has density @xmath89 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 and moves into the front at @xmath103 ( with no transverse velocity ) , while the downstream ( fully ionized ) gas has @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 @xmath90 , and @xmath107 so the if is of @xmath88 type .",
    "we set the pressure as above , and the value of the incident flux as @xmath108 so the initial if would remain steady in the grid . the if breaks up immediately , driving a slow - mode shock away to the right , into the neutral gas , while a slow - mode rarefaction moves away to the left , into the ionized gas .",
    "the d - type if which remains is marginally trans - alfvnic , but has zero transverse magnetic field .    to study this further , in fig .",
    "[ f : dcrit ] , we illustrate a simulation of an if close to the ( hydrodynamic ) d - critical condition , with a parallel magnetic field which makes it trans - alfvnic . when perturbed with small but significant perpendicular field components , this if again switches off these fields by emitting slow - mode waves .",
    "it remains stable , satisfying the hydrodynamic jump conditions as a weakly evolutionary solution of the mhd jump conditions .",
    "we have presented the jump conditions for obliquely - magnetized ionization fronts . we have determined the regions of parameter space in which physical if solutions occur , and have discussed the nature of the interconversions between the types of front .",
    "fast - d and slow - r solutions with high transverse fields are found in the region of front velocities forbidden by the hydrodynamic jump conditions : in the evolution of an  region , the fast - mode shock sent into the neutral gas by the fast - critical transition will act to generate these high transverse fields . in the obliquely - magnetized case ,",
    "the fronts are significantly perturbed as long as the alfvn speed in the neutral gas is greater than @xmath109 .",
    "however , the stability of parallel - magnetized weakly evolutionary if means that the flow may still leave at the isothermal sound speed in the ionized gas over much of the surface of magnetized globules exposed to ionizing radiation fields .",
    "large ( @xmath110 ) , highly ordered magnetic fields have been observed in the molecular gas surrounding some  regions @xcite .",
    "roberts   suggested that the highest observed magnetizations in s106 are associated with unshocked rather than shocked gas , as a result of the relatively low density and velocity shift observed for the strongly magnetized gas .",
    "they suggested that the magnetic field becomes tangled close to the if , leading to the decrease in detectable magnetization .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with the example fast - critical front we discuss in section  [ s : devel ] . scaling the parameters of this front to an exhaust hydrogen density of @xmath111 , typical of an ultracompact  region , a mean mass per hydrogen nucleus of @xmath112 , and a sound speed in the ionized gas of @xmath113 ,",
    "the limiting @xmath33 front takes the flow from an upstream state with @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 to an exhaust with @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( while the fast - r - critical speed is almost exactly twice the exit speed of the front , this ratio decreases in more strongly magnetized fronts ) .",
    "the limiting @xmath34 front takes the flow from @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 to the same final state . a fast - mode shock",
    "ahead of the front and at rest with respect to it would change the upstream state from that of the limiting @xmath33 front to that of the limiting @xmath34 front .",
    "this fast - mode shock , which precedes a limiting fast - weak - d type front , boosts the @xmath17-component of the magnetic field from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , with a @xmath125 change in the @xmath16-velocity and only a @xmath126 change to the @xmath17-velocity component .",
    "a succeeding slow - mode shock would further increase the @xmath16-velocity component and gas density while weakening the @xmath17-component of magnetic field , without recourse to field - tangling .",
    "if we tentatively identify oh component b of roberts  as fast - shocked material and component a as doubly - shocked material , component b is more edge - brightened and has a smaller blueshift than component a as would be expected .",
    "component a is kinematically warmer and most blue shifted towards the centre of the region .",
    "the strong line - of - sight magnetic fields in s106 are seen at the edges of the region , in a ` toroidal ' distribution .",
    "the ( poorly resolved ) line - of - sight velocity of component b has little gradient in the equatorial plane of the region , but this might result in part from a combination of flow divergence and the value of @xmath127 ( which is measured close to the centre of the region ) being rather larger than that of @xmath80 in our example . while the qualitative properties of this assignment are attractive , it remains to calculate a proper model tuned to the properties of the region , in particular its geometry .",
    "nevertheless , the present discussion at least illustrates how both fast and slow shocks should be considered in the analysis of regions with well - ordered magnetization .",
    "we thank sam falle and serguei komissarov for helpful discussions on evolutionary conditions , and the referee for constructive comments which brought several issues into sharper focus .",
