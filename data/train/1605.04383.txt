    "spin - polarized electron injection from a ferromagnetic metal to a diffusive semiconductor has become a promising field of spintronics during the past decades @xcite . since the prediction of half - metallic ( hm ) magnetic heusler alloy nimnsb in 1983 @xcite , the hm materials have been considered as very significant candidates of spin - injector materials due to the high spin polarization ( 100% ) around fermi level . as the potential meaning of hm materials in spintronics ,",
    "much effort has been taken to investigate the hm properties and materials in both theoretical @xcite and experimental researches @xcite .",
    "the hm materials behave metallic character in one spin channel , while insulating or semiconducting character in the opposite spin - channel .",
    "thus they can generate spin - polarized currents with no external operation , and are useful for spintronics application .",
    "however , as reported in some refs .",
    "@xcite , there is a drawback for many hm materials that the spin - polarized currents may be hampered by stray fields which stabilize magnetic domains .",
    "because of its zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell , hm anti - ferromagnet which is a subclass of hm materials , is seen as one of the promising material to avoid the stray fields .",
    "a hm anti - ferromagnet has not only one conductive channel and one insulative or semiconductive channel , but also zero net moment in a unit cell @xcite . different from common anti - ferromagnet , the magnetic moments of two different magnetic ions in hm anti - ferromagnet do compensate each other .",
    "thus , it is more properly called a compensated half metal ( chm ) @xcite .",
    "chm has attracted extreme interest to spintronics and is anticipated to generate a single - spin superconductor due to the zero net magnetic moment @xcite . for a long time , no accurate chm has yet been observed by any experiment .",
    "however , the exploration of chm has never stopped @xcite due to the excellent properties .",
    "very recently , claudia felser and his collaborators report the realisation of chm in experiment @xcite .    among half metals ,",
    "the complex oxides with double perovskite ( dp ) structure have attracted much attention to researchers on account of their interesting properties .",
    "the dp structure oxides have a unit cell twice the size of the regular perovskite structure with a formula of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 @xcite is the first example of dp structure complex oxide reported to be a hm ferromagnet by means of band - structure calculations .",
    "more interesting , in 1998 pickett @xcite predicted dp compound la@xmath0vmn@xmath10 to be a chm . since then , dp oxides have been regarded as the most promising candidates for chm .",
    "so in the past years dp compounds have been investigated widely and sufficiently .",
    "for example , uehara in ref .",
    "@xcite reported that dp compounds @xmath11 and @xmath12 are nearly to be chms by experiment .",
    "dp @xmath13 ( t = nb , mo ) @xcite are not hm ferromagnets within local spin density approximation ( lsda ) , but hm ferromagnets under lsda+u ( considering the coulomb correlations ) .",
    "dp @xmath14 is predicted to be a hm ferrimagnet by both experiment @xcite and density function theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite . with lsda calculations , lee reported dp @xmath15 to be a simple metallic ferrimagnet in ref .",
    "however , including coulomb correlations , dp @xmath15 is predicted to be a chm @xcite , which is also confirmed by fixed spin moment calculations .",
    "hence , the coulomb correlations may probably influence the dft calculations of dp oxide when calculated compounds consist of transition metals .    in 2008",
    "@xcite , the dp compounds @xmath16 ( @xmath17= mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn , cd , pb ) have been synthesized and investigated .",
    "these compounds are consisted of rare earth and transition metal elements .",
    "motivated by the above , we have investigated a series of dp compounds @xmath18 ( re = ce , pr ; x = v , cr , mn , fe , co ) , which are also consisted of rare earth and transition metal elements . the previous investigations @xcite indicate that the dp compounds consisted of two transition metal ( or rare earth ) elements may probably be a chm . and",
    "indeed , among @xmath18 ( re = ce , pr ; x = v , cr , mn , fe , co ) , we find that ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is a chm wihin lsda+u . in this paper , we will study the band structures , origin of anti - ferromagnetism and magnetic evaluation of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 .",
    "the results indicate that the anti - ferromagnetism of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is originated from the spin down state pr@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and the spin up hybridized state between the partially filled @xmath4 state of v and the partially filled triple - degeneration state @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 of pr , and the compensated half - metallic state is the ground state .",
    "we also study the thermodynamic properties of the compound by employing the quasi - harmonic debye model .",
    "the crystal structures are shown in figure 1 , which are synthesized by fixed pr ( 4f ) and substituted v ( 3d ) site .",
    "the cations are treated as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in theory ,",
    "the crystal structure of double perovskite ( dp ) compound ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 can be determined by the value of tolerance factor ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the ionic radius of ba , pr , v and o atoms , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is obtained by using spuds ( structure prediction diagnostic software ) code @xcite .",
    "we calculate the dp compound by employing the formula @xmath27 of the nacl m - cation ordered perovskite with space group of fm3 m ( no . 225 ) . in the cubic dp structure , @xmath28 . when @xmath29 , the bond angle of superexchange @xmath30 is not the ideal , @xmath31 . in consequence ,",
    "the ideal cubic becomes rhombohedral or orthorhombic . and if @xmath32 , a hexagonal structure is formed . in our calculation , @xmath33 , which is around @xmath34 .",
    "hence , the compound has a cubic crystal structure ( shown in figure 1 ) with space group fm3 m indeed .",
    "in addition , we can also get the calculated lattice constant is 8.322  .",
    "ba , pr , v and o atoms occupy 8c ( 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 ) , 4a ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , 4b ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) and 24e ( 0.2324 , 0 , 0 ) , respectively .",
    "so the following calculations are based on the obtained crystal structure information .",
    "the present calculations are carried out with lsda and lsda+u approaches implemented in the first - principle full - potential local - orbital ( fplo ) minimum - basis method code @xcite .",
    "the perdew wang 92 potential @xcite is used for the lsda and lsda+u calculations . in the lsda+u calculations ,",
    "there are two popular double - counting schemes , the so called around mean field @xcite and atomic limit , which showing similar results for the dp compounds .",
    "we only show the around mean field calculation results . according to the various investigations",
    "@xcite , we have chosen the on - site coulomb repulsion u of 7ev and 4ev for pr and v , respectively .",
    "the hund s integral is set as j=0.95 ev for @xmath35 states of pr , and j=0.87 ev for @xmath36 states of v , in which an effective @xmath37 incorporates the on - site coulomb ( u ) and the exchange interaction ( j ) .",
    "for the brillouin zone integration , we use the @xmath38 meshes of @xmath39 for all calculations . for a self - consistent field",
    "iteration , the convergence criterion is set to both the density ( @xmath40 in code specific units ) and the total energy ( @xmath41 hartree ) .",
    "we have chosen u from 5 ev to 10 ev for pr and from 1 ev to 7 ev for v. the calculations give consistent results .",
    "so in the following , we just choose u=7 ev and u=4 ev for pr and v , respectively .",
    "within lsda calculation , ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is ferromagnetic metallic .",
    "however within lsda+u calculation , ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is found to be a chm .",
    "the band structures within lsda and lsda+u calculations are shown in figure 2 . in order to investigate the magnetic properties , we show the integrated density of states ( number of states , nos ) in figure 3 .",
    "firstly , we will discuss the results of lsda calculations . as can be seen in figure 2 ( a ) , within lsda calculations",
    ", it is obvious that the spin up bands get through fermi level , which is a typical character of metallic property .",
    "the spin down bands get fermi level slightly when amplifying the band structure . in order to investigate the property of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 within lsda clearly and deeply",
    ", we demonstrate figure 3 ( a ) .",
    "there is no platform in either spin up or spin down direction around fermi level .",
    "we can see that the noss show a variation tendency to the energy around fermi level in both spin - up and spin - down channels .",
    "so , both spin - up and spin - down channels show metallic character .",
    "in addition , the noss of spin up and spin down are 47.24 and 46.50 at fermi level , respectively .",
    "so the total magnetic moment of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is 0.74 @xmath42 .",
    "hence , ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is not half - metallic ferromagnetic , but ferromagnetic metallic within lsda .",
    "secondly , we discuss the results of lsda+u calculations .",
    "as can be seen in figure 2 ( b ) , within lsda+u calculations , for ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 , the spin up bands get through fermi level , showing a metal character .",
    "however , there is a band gap in the spin down bands , behaving a semiconductor character . as a result ,",
    "the spin polarization is 100% .",
    "in addition , as shown in table 1 , the total magnetic moment is zero for ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 .",
    "hence ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is a chm within lsda+u calculations . the same as previous ,",
    "let us focus on the integrated dos in order to understand the magnetic properties of the dp compound ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 . as can be seen in figure 3 ( b )",
    ", there is a platform around fermi level in the spin down integrated dos . as for the spin up direction",
    ", there is no platform around fermi level .",
    "the integrated dos in spin - up direction shows a variation tendency to the energy around fermi level . taking account into the former aspects",
    ", we can get the conclusion that ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is half - metallic .",
    "in addition , at fermi level the noss of spin down and spin up are 47 and 47 , which are the same values .",
    "so the net total magnetic moment is zero .",
    "hence ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is a chm within lsda+u .      in this section , we will study the origin of anti - ferromagnetism for + ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 .",
    "the total and partial density of states ( dos ) within lsda+u for ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 are presented in figure 4 .",
    "the triple - degeneration state of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 for pr is named as @xmath43 state in our paper . according to the population analysis of electrons , the valencies of both v and pr are 4 + .",
    "and the @xmath20 and @xmath19 cations have the configurations of @xmath20 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath45 ) , respectively .",
    "as can be seen in figure 4 , in the spin - up channel , most of the partially filled 6o@xmath46 states lie beyond fermi level and only a few of them are below fermi level . while in the spin - down channel , the corresponding 6o@xmath46 states are above fermi level .",
    "so the magnetic moment originated from 6o@xmath46 states is very small ( 0.19 @xmath42 ) .",
    "in the spin - down channel , the strong local state ( @xmath3 ) is at about -4.8 ev , while the corresponding strong local state is at about 2.5 ev in the spin - up channel .",
    "one electron occupies at the strong local state ( @xmath3 ) in the spin - down channel , which providing a negative magnetic moment . around fermi level , the partially filled @xmath4 state of v and the partially filled @xmath43 state of pr hybrid with each other in the spin - up channel .",
    "one electron occupies at the partially filled hybridized state in the spin - up channel , which providing most of the positive magnetic moment .",
    "it is obvious that the anti - ferromagnetism of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is originated from the anti - aligned spin states between ( @xmath3 ) state and hybridized @xmath47 state .",
    "as described in ref.@xcite , the chm state may not be the ground state . in this section , the magnetic evaluation of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1",
    "is studied by fixed spin moment ( fsm ) calculations within lsda+u , and the results are shown in figure 5 . we can obtain the solutions : ferrimagnetic ( fi ) state below @xmath48 and ferromagnetic ( fm ) state above @xmath49 , while both states coexist in the region from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .    let us focus on the fi state at first . as @xmath50 is increased from the chm state ( @xmath50=0 ) , the energy increases monotonically .",
    "besides , considering the symmetry between positive and negative magnetic moment , we can get the @xmath50=0 is a local minimum point of energy to magnetic moment .",
    "in fi state , the energy increases almost linearly to the increasing of magnetic moment .",
    "@xmath51 keeps positive value and decreases gradually , while @xmath52 keeps negative value and also decreases gradually .",
    "so @xmath53 decreases gradually and keeps below -1 .",
    "however , beyond @xmath54 , @xmath51 changes violently with the increasing of @xmath50 , and quickly reaches to zero . hence , around @xmath54",
    ", @xmath53 changes violently to @xmath50 , leading to non - analytic behaviour in the fsm curve in this range .",
    "the discontinuous trend means phase transition may occur around @xmath54 .",
    "next , we will focus on fm state . as @xmath50 is increased from @xmath55 ,",
    "the energy decreases monotonically and reaches a local minimum at @xmath56 , meaning another local stable state occurs .",
    "however , this fm state has a higher energy by 1.28 ev than the chm state .",
    "hence , the chm state is the ground state . below @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath58 changes violently to magnetic moment , leading to non - analytic behaviour in the fsm curve in this range .",
    "it means the phase transition occurs below @xmath57 . in the fm state , @xmath58 decreases with the increasing of @xmath50 , and finally tends to 2 .",
    "the stable fm state ( @xmath56 ) is half - metallic ferromagnetic ( hmf ) .",
    "the magnetic moments for ba , v , pr and 6o are 0.01 @xmath42 , 0.65 @xmath42 , 1.43 @xmath42 and -0.09 @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the magnetic moments of pr and v are parallel now .    in a word",
    ", we have studied the magnetic evaluation of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 within lsda+u , and found that the chm state is the ground state .",
    "study of the thermodynamic of materials is very important to the extension of our knowledge about their special behaviours under some external conditions , which can help us in the application of materials .",
    "so in the following , we will investigate the thermodynamic properties of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 . in order to study the temperature and pressure dependences of thermodynamic properties for the crystal ,",
    "we have employed the quasi - harmonic debye model as a simple way to take into account the vibrational motion of the lattice . here",
    "the quasi - harmonic debye model is implemented in the pseudo code gibbs @xcite , in which the isotropic approximation is considered .",
    "as described in ref @xcite , only with a series of ( v , e(v ) ) points around the equilibrium geometry can the code gibbs calculate out many thermodynamic properties .",
    "the non - equilibrium gibbs energy @xmath59 is expressed by @xmath60,\\ ] ] where e(v ) , pv , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the total energy per unit cell , constant hydrostatic pressure condition , vibrational term and debye temperature , respectively .",
    "the vibrational term @xmath61 can be written using debye model of phonon density of states as : @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , n and @xmath65 are the debye integral , number of atoms in a chemical formula and boltzmann constant , respectively . using the quasi - harmonic debye model in slater formulation , the debye temperature @xmath66 is calculated from the static bulk moduli @xmath67 , while poisson ratio ( @xmath68 ) is assumed to be volume independent and equal to @xmath69 , corresponding to a cauchy solid .",
    "considering the assumption of isotropic conditions , as a function of @xmath68 and v , @xmath66 can be given by @xcite @xmath70^{\\frac{1}{3}}f(\\nu)\\sqrt{\\frac{b_s}{m}},\\ ] ] where m is molecular mass per formula unit .",
    "@xmath71 is expressed as @xmath72^{-1}\\}^{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\ ] ]    the static bulk modulus can be computed by the curvature of the @xmath73 function : @xmath74    the curvature of the @xmath73 function changes with volume , increasing sharply as the compression of crystal , and decreasing gently as the expansion of crystal .",
    "this asymmetry between the curvature at the left and right of the equilibrium volume is originated from the volume dependence of @xmath66 and is the main reason behind the capability of the quasi - harmonic debye model to predict the low temperature behaviour of crystal , including @xmath75 dependency .",
    "accordingly , the non - equilibrium gibbs function @xmath76 as a function of v , p and t can be minimized with respect to v : @xmath77_{p , t}=0.\\ ] ]    by solving the above equation , we can obtain the thermal equation of state ( eos ) @xmath78 .",
    "the heat capacity at constant volume @xmath79 , isothermal bulk modulus @xmath80 , and thermal expansion coefficient @xmath43 can be respectively expressed by : @xmath81,\\ ] ]    @xmath82    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the gr@xmath85neisen parameter . and",
    "@xmath84 is defined by : @xmath86    through the quasi - harmonic debye model described above , we have calculated the thermodynamic properties of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 at the temperature range from 0 to 500 k and in the pressure range from 0 to 20 gpa , where the quasi - harmonic model keeps valid enough .",
    "the relationship plots of bulk modulus ( b ) to pressure ( p ) at different temperature ( t ) are shown in figure 6 .",
    "as can be seen , b increases linearly with p at a given t. in addition , in our calculated range , the difference of b for various temperature at a given pressure is such small that the plots of 0k , 300k and 500k almost seem to overlapping .",
    "heat capacity is also an important thermodynamic parameter . through heat capacity @xmath79",
    ", we can get the information about lattice vibrations , energy band structures , electron density of states , phase transition of solid and so on . the heat capacity @xmath79 of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 as a function of t with p at 0 gpa , 5 gpa , 10 gpa , 15 gpa , 20 gpa and as a function of p with t at 100 k , 200 k , 300 k , 400 k , 500 k are shown in figure 7 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . as can be seen from figure 7 ( a ) , under some given pressures the @xmath79 of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is proportional to @xmath87 at low temperature .",
    "in addition , @xmath79 increases monotonically with temperature and tends to a constant value at high temperature , which is the petit and dulong limit @xcite and a common phenomenon of all solids . from figure 7 ( b ) , we can find that @xmath79 decreases slowly and almost linearly with pressure at given temperature and @xmath79 is almost independent of pressure at high temperature .",
    "hence , we can get the conclusion that the effects of t and p on @xmath79 are opposite , and the influence of the former is more significant than that of the later for ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 .    the debye temperature ( @xmath66 ) is a critical fundamental parameter closely related to many physical properties , for example specific heat and melting temperature .",
    "the debye temperature @xmath66 of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 as a function t with p at 0 gpa , 5 gpa , 10 gpa , 15 gpa , 20 gpa and as a function of p with t at 100 k , 200 k , 300 k , 400 k , 500 k are shown in figure 7 ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "as can be seen form figure 7 ( c ) , @xmath66 is slightly linearly decreasing with the increasing of t. the @xmath66 at pressure of 0 gpa , 5 gpa , 10 gpa , 15 gpa and 20 gpa is reduced by 2.38% , 2.15% , 1.92% , 1.69% and 1.52% when t changes from 0 k to 500 k , respectively . in addition , as shown in figure 7(d ) , @xmath66 increases quickly but non - linearly with the increasing of p. the @xmath66 at 100 k , 200 k , 300 k , 400 k and 500 k are increased by 22.32% , 22.54% , 22.82% , 23.09% and 23.34% when p changes from 0 gpa to 20 gpa , respectively .",
    "hence the effects of t and p are also opposite , and the influence of the latter is much more significant than that of the former for ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 . as shown in figure 7(d ) , with the increasing of p , @xmath66 increases non - linearly and its slope becomes less , revealing the vibration frequency of lattice is changing under pressure .    the thermal expansion ( @xmath43 ) of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 as a function of t with p at 0 gpa , 5 gpa , 10 gpa , 15 gpa , 20 gpa and as a function of p with t at 100 k , 200 k , 300 k , 400 k , 500 k are shown in figure 7 ( e ) and ( f ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath43 increases rapidly with t at low temperature and decreases non - linearly with p at low pressure .",
    "in addition , @xmath43 gradually approaches a linear increase to t at high temperature ( @xmath88 ) and a linear decrease to p at high pressure ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "so , the effects of t and p on @xmath43 are opposite as well .",
    "so in conclusion , we have found that the effects of t and p on @xmath79 , @xmath66 and @xmath43 are opposite .      in this section ,",
    "we study the stability of the cubic structure under tetragonal distortion at first .",
    "the energy of the tetragonal phase as a function of c / a is shown in figure 8 . the ratio c / a=1 represents the cubic geometry .",
    "as can be seen , cubic structure has minimum energy in a wide range of the ratio c / a .",
    "so the cubic structure of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is more stable than its tetragonal phase .",
    "finally let us study coulomb effect on the properties of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 .",
    "the total and partial density of states for some values of u ( @xmath90 = 3 and 4 ev ; @xmath91=8 and 9 ev ) are shown in figure 9 .",
    "one can see that the total and partial density of states are consistent in different values of u. it indicates that the compensated half metallicity can be preserved when the coulomb interaction is taken into account in this case .",
    "in the present paper , the electronic structure , band structures , magnetic properties , magnetic evaluation and thermodynamic properties of the double perovskite compound ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 have been investigated by using first - principle calculations . within lsda calculation , ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is metallic ferromagnetic .",
    "it is found that ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is a compensated half metal under lsda+u calculations with the anti - ferromagnetism of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 is originated from the anti - aligned spin states between ( @xmath3 ) state and hybridized @xmath47 state . through fsm calculations , we find that compensated half metallic state is the ground state . employing the quasi - harmonic debye model , we have studied the thermodynamic properties of ba@xmath0prvo@xmath1 , such as bulk modulus , heat capacity , debye temperature and thermal expansion under temperature and pressure .",
    "we hope that our work will stimulate the exploration of chm in both experiment and theory .",
