    "mev gamma - ray astronomy provides the unique opportunity to study supernovae ( sne ) , as fresh radio isotopes in sne emit mev gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "studies of active galactic nuclei and galaxies reveal the evolution of the early universe @xcite . also , gamma - ray bursts are a promising probe to catch the first star @xcite . especially , sne are the most fascinating objects and are vigorously studied in all the fields of astronomy .",
    "nevertheless , there still remain the many fundamental mysteries , such as , the origin of sne type - ia and nucleosynthesis .",
    "although the thermonuclear explosion of a single degenerate white dwarf ( swd ) has been believed to be the origin of sne ia and accordingly has been used as a distance standard in cosmology , a merger of two wds ( dwd ) has been frequently pointed out the more plausible origin @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of the observations in mev gammas to conclusively determine the origin was remarked @xcite , considering that mev gammas are the unique probe that are directly emitted from the exploding or merging regions .",
    "they pointed out that a delayed peaking time ( 80 days , compared to 50 days for swds ) appears in dwds due to its higher total mass , in contrast to the predicted model - independent peak time of 20 days from optical observations .",
    "most of those sources are expected to be faint , because the number of the detected gammas is proportional to the cubic of the distance to the source .",
    "each detection will contain a substantial amount of uncertainties , such as , fluctuations of @xmath5ni production(@xmath620% ) and viewing angles @xcite .",
    "we then estimate that detection of @xmath1100 sne , each of which should have @xmath75@xmath8 significance in 10 days of observation , is required to obtain the statistically robust confirmation of these features . given the optical results of @xmath115 and @xmath150/year sne ia and collapsars ( sne ib , c , and ii ) , respectively , within 60  mpc @xcite , an mev instrument with a sensitivity of @xmath110@xmath9  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 for 10@xmath10 s is needed to catch gammas of these sne with the above - mentioned significance .",
    "thus , to push such a new field in mev - gamma astronomy , an instrument with a high sensitivity of @xmath11  mcrab ( @xmath11  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 at 1  mev in 10@xmath10  s ) is desired .        historically , comptel operated with only @xmath11/3 of the sensitivity expected from the calibration test before launch , and it may give a concern in estimating the true sensitivity in orbit .",
    "the primary two causes of this discrepancy in comptel are now understood as huge backgrounds in space and unclearness in the compton images @xcite .    after the close of the comptel observations , it was pointed out that the additional parameters , including time of flight , kinematical tests , and scatter plane deviation ( spd ) from the direction of the recoil electrons , would be necessary to reduce the background for the next - generation compton cameras ( ccs ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in comptel the time of flight between the forward and backward detectors dramatically reduced the background and was a primary factor for the success of comptel .",
    "ideally , the point spread function ( psf ) of ccs must be evaluated , based on the two parameters of angular resolution measure ( arm ) and spd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etcc_schematic ] .",
    "however , spd is lost in ccs , due to lack of direction information of the recoil electrons , thus the psf shape is inevitably assumed to be rather spread ( see section  6 ) .",
    "the recovery of the spd by measuring recoil - electron tracking is then expected to both ( 1 ) improve the measured psf by up to several degrees and ( 2 ) reduce a substantial amount of contamination of the background leaked to the source region from the outside .",
    "in addition , the additional parameters of @xmath12 in recoil - electron tracking are independent of the reconstruction of compton events , and therefore , use of them would suppress the background dramatically without losing compton events .",
    "in contrast , ccs with no additional parameter may lose a significant amount of compton events in intense backgrounds , because the application of cuts on physical parameters , such as , energy deposits or hit positions , produces a massive uncertainty for the sensitivity .",
    "nevertheless , the recent trend in developing advanced ccs concentrates on pursuing a larger effective area and a better energy resolution to improve the arm resolution .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported no detection of crab in a balloon experiment with the liquid xe ccs that has the largest effective area of 20 @xmath13 @xcite . the nct balloon experiment with the ge - based cc and bgo shield detected crab with 4@xmath8 @xcite , although the reported number of signals from the crab region was @xmath11/6 of simulation over a large background .",
    "recent satellite proposals in mev astronomy , in which the proposed sensitivities are larger than several mcrab , mention little on both of these problems @xcite .",
    "as such , it seems to be difficult for even advanced ccs to reach the desirable sensitivity in space .",

    "we present the performance of an improved 30 cm - cubic etcc for our second balloon experiment ( smile - ii ) .",
    "we have successfully made robust reduction of background and obtained clear images by 3d electron tracking . in section  [ sec : etcc ] , the concept and structure of the etcc are concisely explained .",

    "an etcc consists of a tpc based on a micro pattern gas detector ( mpgd ) with 400  @xmath14 m pitch pixels for 3d tracking of recoil electrons and gd@xmath18sio@xmath24:ce ( gso ) pixel scintillator arrays ( psas ) to measure scattered gamma rays @xcite . with an ideal effective area of 100 @xmath13 at 1 mev for a 50 cm - cubic 3 atm cf@xmath21 gas , such a tpc would be a good device for a cc with electron - tracking .",
    "cf@xmath21 gas is an ideal gas for etcc , with significant benefits , including a large cross section for compton scattering , small photo - absorption cross section , and small diffusion constant ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] for detail ) .",
    "several time - projection chambers have already been operated with pure cf@xmath21 in accelerators and underground experiments @xcite .",
    "however , we need more study to use the cf@xmath21-dominant gas in the mpgd - based tpc , due to the requirement of a higher - voltage electric field on the mpgd .",
    "in particular , good reliability for the stable operation of the tpc is crucial in the balloon experiments , and hence we at present use ar - based gases with some additional quencher gases to study the effectiveness of electron tracking .",
    "table  [ tab : config ] summarizes the detailed components of the ar - based gases used in our experiments .",
    "3d tracking of the recoil electron provides the incident gamma - ray direction as an arc by adding spd to arm ( the additional angle of @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ fig : etcc_schematic]a ) , and the energy - loss rate ( @xmath12 ) of the track , all of which are effective tools to reduce backgrounds by directional cut , kinematical tests and particle identification , respectively",
    ". note we have already examined the concept of etcc @xcite , including an arm resolution of 4@xmath26 ( fwhm ) at 662 kev with labr@xmath23 psas for medical imaging @xcite .",

    "only one or a few tracks , including background for compton events , is found to appear in the tpc . given that , conventional orthogonal strip electrodes , instead of pixel electrodes , as used in typical tpcs , could be used to reconstruct the 3d tracks by slicing along the direction of the electron drift using fast timing , and by combing the anode and cathode hits that have the same times @xcite .",
    "then , we could reduce the number of readout electrodes of the tpc by an order of two for this 30 cm - cubic etcc , which is an allowable level using recent asic and fpga , while satisfying the severe constraint of balloon experiments for power consumption , space and cost .",
    "however , such a drastic reduction of the number of signals would also introduce a risk of increasing the ambiguity of electron tracking , as mentioned later .        for mev astronomy , smile",

    "we selected 400 downward gamma - rays from 2.3@xmath1710@xmath27 triggered events , using the kinematical test and @xmath12 @xcite , where a kinematical test was made with comparison of the measured angle @xmath25 to the calculated one , @xmath28 as mentioned in section  [ sec : etcc ] of @xcite .",
    "although both the resolution for @xmath12 and the detection efficiency were inefficient , due to a low tracking efficiency of @xmath110% , in which at least 5 hit points on each track were required , the combination of the @xmath12 cut and kinematical test was found to be useful for the reduction of neutrons and cosmic rays .",
    "this inefficiency was not due to the low gain of the mpgd but to a bug in the algorithms set in the fpga used in the readout electronics ( see the next section for detail ) .",
    "the obtained diffuse atmospheric and cosmic fluxes were consistent with past observations .",
    "in addition , it is noted that its cubic structure provides a large field of view ( fov ) of 2@xmath29 str .",
    "we have been attempting to establish a high sensitivity for the etcc , using a 30 cm - cubic etcc ( fig .  [",

    "the improvement of the reconstruction of tracks in the tpc was an essential factor for smile - ii . for smile - i , only addresses of the anode and cathode strips hitting simultaneously within a 10  ns gate were encoded . however , a 10  ns gate is too short to get all hit strips , due to the delay in the encoding circuit .",
    "this was the reason for the small effective area of smile - i . to recover all hit points in smile - ii , all addresses of the hit strips on anode and cathode with their hit timings",
    "are recorded without requiring the coincidence of 10  ns , and an adequate gate is applied in the analysis @xcite .",
    "in addition , a pulse height of each strip was recorded as a timing width over the threshold ( tot ) .",

    "[ fig : effective_area ] ]    figure  [ fig : dedx]a shows the track range and its energy deposit for 662 kev gammas from @xmath33cs source set at a distance of 1 m from the etcc , in which @xmath12 is a gradient of the distribution .",
    "the measured @xmath12 in this figure clearly distinguishes the compton electrons fully contained in the tpc from the backgrounds , and resultantly enables us to remove most of the backgrounds without loss of compton events by applying cuts .",
    "the red - dashed line in this figure is the empirical formula of @xmath12 , which is approximately proportional to e@xmath35 @xcite , for recoil electrons fully contained in the tpc .",
    "the region within e@xmath36 contains @xmath195% of compton events inside ( @xmath12 cut ) , as supported by the simulation result . in this article , all simulations",
    "were done using geant4 @xcite .",
    "the simulation also shows the distribution of higher energy particles , such as , electrons escaping from the tpc and minimum ionizing particles ( cosmic muons ) on the upper boundary , as actually seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dedx]a .",
    "in addition , the scattering point of the track is required to be within 1 mm inside the drift region of the tpc in order to remove events originated from gammas that scattered from the wall of the drift cage of the tpc ( fiducial cut ) , with which @xmath110% of the events passing the @xmath12 cut were removed .",
    "thus , by applying only two simple cuts , almost all of the fully contained compton events are obtained , after several kinds of backgrounds are filtered out . for the obtained fully contained compton events , effective areas were measured at several energy points , using ri sources of @xmath37ce , @xmath31ba , @xmath32na , @xmath33cs and @xmath34mn , along with the simulation results for several types of etccs , where the effective area was obtained from the number of detected gammas within twice the fwhm of the energy resolution centered at the gamma energy in the background - subtracted energy spectrum .",
    "the simulation results were obtained mainly from the production of two probabilities : that of compton scattering and its recoil electron contained fully in the tpc , and that of the full absorption of scattered gammas in the psas , where the absorption of the materials of the tpc and the supporting frames are taken into account .",

    "a large fov of 2@xmath29 str similar to smile - i was confirmed for the 30 cm - cubic etcc @xcite .",
    "thus , we are able to estimate precisely the effective area for the extensions of the volume , gas type and pressures of the tpc , or the r.l . , and the better energy resolution of psas .",
    "these simple extensions ensure an effective area of 11 @xmath13 at 300 kev for a following balloon experiment with a long duration flight ( smile - iii ) and that of 60 @xmath13 with 2@xmath26 ( arm , fwhm ) at 1 mev for a 50 cm - cubic etcc with cf@xmath21 gas at 3 atm and @xmath110 r.l .",

    "furthermore , a satellite - etcc consisting of four 50 cm - cubic etccs for a middle - class satellite would reach  240 @xmath13 ( 4@xmath1760 @xmath13 ) with an arm resolution of 2@xmath26 at 1 mev .",

    "[ fig : arm_spd ] also gives the arm resolutions for future etccs with scintillators with better energy resolution .",
    "the discrepancies between the measured and calculated arm resolutions are considered to arise from the @xmath18 mm uncertainty in the track for the scattering point of the gamma , due to the worsened 3d reconstruction of the recoil electron , as mentioned below .",

    "even a spd with such a poor resolution is useful to improve the image quality ( see section  [ sec : spd ] for detail ) .",
    "the deterioration of the spd resolution is mainly due to the well - known ambiguity from multi - hits on the orthogonal 2d strip readout in the tpc .",
    "usually , @xmath39-hits on anode and cathode strips in the same timing generate @xmath40 hit points ( figs .",

    "in order to investigate quantitatively the performance of the etcc under intense radiation conditions similar to those found in space , we performed a test using a 140 mev proton beam incident on a water target to produce a diffuse background of fast neutrons and mev gamma - rays .",
    "the 30 cm - cubic etcc was placed at a distance of 1.3  m from the target , and direct gammas from the water target were shielded with lead blocks , allowing us to uniformly irradiate the etcc @xcite .",

    "it is also noted that the detection efficiency was consistent with that measured in the laboratory using the same cuts , as in fig .",

    "unclean images are another serious problem in the cc . however it has been dramatically improved by determining the spd for all the events .        in ccs ,",
    "images are obtained by accumulating compton annuli on the celestial sphere , where a fair amount of background event annuli overlap the target region and produce serious artifacts .",

    "the probability functions of one gamma were defined as an annulus with the area normalized to 1 for a cc @xcite and as a gaussian normalized with the spd resolution for the etcc .",
    "the spd resolution was determined by the uncertainty of the reconstruction method rather than the multiple scattering of a recoil electron ( section  [ sec : etcc ] ) .",
    "we have recently successfully improved the time resolution of the coincidence between anodes and cathodes to 1 ns from 10 ns by correcting the time walk of each hit pixel using the tot . as a result ,",
    "the reduction of the number of multi hits in a track provides a very clear image of the track ( figs .",
    "[ fig : tracks]c and [ fig : tracks]d ) .",
    "such a clear track enables us to measure the spd at a distance of 1 cm from the scattering point , which reduces the effect of multiple scattering in the gas .",
    "figure  [ fig : arm_spd]c shows a correlation between the improved spd and the electron energy .",
    "the spread of the spd obviously shrinks , as the electron energy increases ( @xmath780 kev ) ( figs .",
    "[ fig : arm_spd]d and [ fig : arm_spd]e ) .",
    "the spd resolutions are nearly consistent with the multiple scattering angles in ar gas .",
    "next , we reanalyzed the case presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3src]b with a spd resolution of 100@xmath26 and two spd resolutions optimized for low energy electrons ( @xmath3080 kev ) and high energy ones ( @xmath780 kev ) , and plotted the results in figures  [ fig:3src]c and [ fig:3src]d , respectively .",
    "we found a massive increase in the signal by @xmath110@xmath8 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3src]d , the most reliable spd resolution that maximizes the imaging significance was estimated for each energy range ( 10 - 80 kev and @xmath780 kev ) , although we should note that the significances are moderately dependent on the spd resolutions .",
    "these value are better than the spd resolutions in figs .",
    "[ fig : arm_spd]d and [ fig : arm_spd]e ( see the caption of fig .  [",
    "fig : arm_spd ] ) .",
    "our etcc provides a robust recipe for both removing the huge backgrounds and producing clear images , and as a result , gives nearly 10 times better overall sensitivity than that of conventional cc .",
    "the next important step would be the improvement of the spd resolution up to the multiple scattering - angle in order to exploit the potential of electron tracking .",
    "it is well known that the annulus of conventional cc leads to multiple intersections and a wide spread of the psf .",
    "a better spd resolution is naively expected to increase the significance by a factor roughly proportional to 180@xmath26/(spd resolution ) .",
    "our simulation results appear to confirm it figures  [ fig : sigma_spd]a and [ fig : sigma_spd]b , where a s / n of @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 total events ) is assumed . in the simulation ,",
    "the variation of the significance as a function of the spd resolution was calculated for three accumulated regions on the fov and two arm resolutions , while constraining the compton scattering angle @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etcc_schematic]a ) to smaller than 60@xmath26 .",
    "gases with varying electron energies , where the normal pressure is assumed for both gases .",
    "the circle , square and triangle are the root mean square of spd resolutions of 200@xmath26 ( before improvement ) , 90@xmath26 and 45@xmath26 ( from fig .  [ fig:3src]d ) , respectively .",
    "the hatched region corresponds to the spd resolutions expected by fine track sampling of 400 @xmath14 m pitch with a fine fitting .",
    "[ fig : multiple_scatter ] ]    figure  [ fig : multiple_scatter ] shows the calculated dependence of the multiple scattering angle of the recoil electron along the length of the track used for the angle measurement for ar and cf@xmath21 gases at the normal pressure and cf@xmath21 at 3 atm , where the calculation was performed with geant4 , in which we employed an empirical expression for the multiple scattering based on experimental data @xcite .",
    "we expect to improve the spd resolution to the hatched region in this figure ( see the discussion later in this section ) .",
    "thus , the spd resolutions for gammas above 500 kev ( with recoil - electron energy of @xmath7200 kev ) and above 1  mev will be reduced to within 20@xmath26 and 10@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the cumulative ratio of the psf for gammas emitted from a point source is plotted as a function of its angular radius for three spd resolutions ( 100@xmath26 , 25@xmath26 , and 5@xmath26 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] , along with the annulus of a conventional cc , where two arm resolutions of 2@xmath26 and 5@xmath26 ( fwhm ) are assumed .",
    "hereafter , psf ( @xmath45 ) is defined to contain a half of the gammas emitted from the point source within the angular radius @xmath45 .",
    "first , from fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] , we note that the psf is predominantly dependent on the worse one between the spd and arm resolutions , where an spd resolution of @xmath120@xmath26 gives a similar dispersion as an arm resolution of 5@xmath26 when projected on the celestial sphere .",
    "the improvement in the significance due to better arm resolutions is only seen for the case with the spd resolution of better than @xmath130@xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] ) .",
    "thus , the improvement of the arm resolution from @xmath46 to @xmath47 is effective in improving the psf only if the spd resolution is also improved below @xmath130@xmath26 .",
    "the psf for conventional ccs , on the other hand , appears to be determined by the compton scattering angle @xmath48 of fig .",
    "[ fig : etcc_schematic]a , judging from the fact that the cumulative ratio of the psf reaches 1 at @xmath1120@xmath26 , or the largest diameter of the scattering @xmath48 .",
    "thus , only an improved spd resolution can counteract the spread of signals due to the annulus in a cc , and can recover a point - like psf similar to telescopes in other energy bands .",
    "and 5@xmath26 , respectively , and solid , dotted , dashed and dotted - dashed lines are conventional cc , spd resolutions of 5@xmath26 , 25@xmath26 , and 100@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "[ fig : psf ] ]    the wide spread of the psf for poor spd resolutions and conventional ccs is due to the normalization of the probability on the arc and annulus ( section  [ sec : spd ] ) , which is necessary to keep the background level statistically similar for any spd resolution , including an annulus .",
    "maximum likelihood expectation maximization ( ml - em ) has been used in ccs to compensate for the spread and sharpen the psf of gamma - ray sources from the background @xcite .",
    "when the statistics of the signals are ideal , ml - em can extract the maximum signal as determined by the effective area and psf ( arm resolution ) .",
    "however , even with ml - em , it is difficult to reproduce statistically poor signals from a huge background with the uncertainty at the similar level as the signal .",
    "we also note that an inherent risk of introducing artifacts for such background - dominated data should not be underestimated , particularly in mev gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "thus , conventional ccs have looked to detect signals for bright celestial objects only , for which the ml - em works optimally .",
    "however , moderate - intensity objects , whose flux was judged to be sufficient to allow detection , based on the sensitivity estimated from the effective area and psf , actually turned out to be difficult to detect due to the breakdown of the ml - em method . on the other hand ,",
    "ml - em would function well for an etcc , thanks to its sharp psf and low background . more fundamentally",
    ", the sensitivity would be determined solely by the effective area and the psf , and supplemental tools , such as ml - em , only serve to improve the significance by several factors by applying some constraints .",
    "considering all those , how would a better spd resolution be attained , using the present technology of the etcc ? in the present detector technology , a gaseous tpc with a micro - pattern detector provides very accurate 3d tracking for electrons in the energy range from kev to mev .",
    "even a high - resolution ccd with a 10 @xmath14 m pixel pitch and 2d tracking has been reported to provide an spd resolution of only @xmath1200@xmath26 fwhm for @xmath1100 kev for 2d tracking @xcite .",
    "we have just begun the detailed study of the 3d reconstruction of recoil electrons in the gas of the etcc , and expect to be able to improve the uncertainty of the compton - scattering point from the current @xmath18 mm down to a few millimeters .",
    "this will improve both the spd and arm resolutions to about a half of the present value and to the calculated value in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] , respectively .",
    "the selection of the gas for the tpc is the most important factor for the performance of the etcc . in general",
    ", a scatterer of ccs should provide a large cross - section of compton scattering , while also having a small cross - section for photo absorption to minimize the background .",
    "in addition , a small diffusion constant and small multiple scattering for the recoil electron are very important for the etcc .",
    "all of the requirements above can be met with cf@xmath21 gas in the etcc .",
    "then , we are planning to use a 3 atm cf@xmath21 gas in the next version of the etcc .",
    "cf@xmath21 gas has a large compton - scattering cross - section due to the large number of electrons per molecule ( 44 ) , while simultaneously suppressing the photo - absorption cross - section , which is proportional to @xmath49 in the born approximation ( with the atomic number @xmath50 = 9 for f ) .",
    "its diffusion constant is smaller than that of ar gas .",
    "hence , it is possible to develop a larger tpc with a drift length greater than 50  cm , where a positional error at the mpgd due to the fluctuation of the centroid of the diffusive drift - electron cloud over a 50-cm drift length is estimated to be @xmath1150  @xmath14 m in a 3 atm cf@xmath21 gas .",
    "furthermore , with the use of cf@xmath21 , the spd resolution , which is the most important parameter for the etcc , is expected to be improved in the following reason . for pressurized gas ,",
    "the multiple scattering angle is proportional to the product of @xmath51(pressure ) and @xmath51(track range ) . whereas the multiple scattering angle per length of cf@xmath21 is similar to that of ar gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multiple_scatter ] ) , @xmath12 is 3 times larger , and the diffusion constant is smaller , than those of ar gas .",
    "then , combined with a smaller track sampling of 400 @xmath14 m ( reduced from the present 800 @xmath14 m ) , it would significantly improve the fitting resolution of the track . with this expected improvement",
    ", it would be possible to reduce the track range needed to measure the spd from 1 cm down to a few mm , which would exceed the increase of the multiple scattering due to the increase in gas pressure to 3 atm .",
    "thus , an etcc with pressured cf@xmath21 gas would give a slightly better psf than that of ar gas at the normal pressure .",
    "this fact , combined with the properties described above , makes cf@xmath21 gas extremely well suited to provide the optimum performance for our etcc .",
    "next , although the introduction of @xmath12 and spd successfully resolved the two problems of huge backgrounds and unclear images , we should also consider the backgrounds that can not be removed in theory with @xmath12 and/or spd , i.e. , the simultaneous emission of x- and gamma - rays or two gamma - rays from radioisotopes generated by cosmic rays , and accidental coincidences between the tpc and psas .",
    "due to the large cross - section for photo absorption of x - rays , false compton events arise from a photo - electric absorption of one gamma - ray ( or x - ray ) in the tpc and a random coincidence of a second gamma - ray in the psa . indeed , those false events were reported to be one of the dominant backgrounds in comptel @xcite",
    ". however , the small photo - electric absorption cross - section of cf@xmath21 ( @xmath11/5 of that of ar with the same number density of atoms ) makes it considerably less sensitive to x - rays compared to ar and si .",
    "absorption probabilities for x - rays at an energy of a few tens of kev in a 50 cm - cubic 3 atm cf@xmath21 and 8 atm ar are transparent ( @xmath110% at 30  kev ) and opaque ( @xmath780% ) , respectively , where the respective pressures are chosen so that they have the same compton - scattering probability .",
    "such insensitivity to x - rays of cf@xmath21 also reduces the false compton events , because most of the single hits in the tpc are due to x - rays .",
    "furthermore , the etcc provides another tool to remove such backgrounds via a kinematical test using the angle @xmath25 of fig .",
    "[ fig : etcc_schematic]a , which was introduced as a new parameter for the etcc in smile - i ( section  [ sec : etcc ] ) . the poor angular resolution for the direction of the recoil electron would result in the rejection of a number of good compton events .",
    "for that reason , we have not used the kinematic test for smile - ii . however , because such events do not satisfy compton kinematics , the angle @xmath25 should be randomly distributed between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "further improvement of the directional resolution of the recoil electron will reduce the uncertainty of @xmath25 to @xmath3020@xmath26 ( from the current @xmath140@xmath26 at fwhm ) , which will allow us to suppress such background by nearly one order of magnitude .",
    "a final remark is that we have developed the etcc , using well - established technologies ( i.e. , gas counters and scintillators ) , and even a 4-module satellite etcc would need only @xmath110@xmath54 read - out channels for tpc and psas with low power electronics and no specific cooling system .",
    "in addition , due to the strong background rejection capability , no active shield would be required .",
    "then , the component with the largest contribution to the weight would be the scintillators ( more than half the total weight ) , which is intrinsically needed to absorb and detect gamma rays .",
    "thus , the etcc would be the lightest cc , and would provide the lowest background - radiation level in space .",
    "we have revealed that the spd dramatically recovers the gammas detected in the effective area within several degrees of the target position , whereas they exude sparsely over the fov in conventional cc . with this , @xmath110 times better sensitivity than cc per unit effective area will be certainly expected ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sigma_spd ] ) . also , the radical reduction of almost all the instrumental background is found to be attainable by the use of the measured @xmath12 of the recoil electron , a kinematical test of the @xmath25 angle and the optimization of the scattering material such as cf@xmath21 . our etcc has changed delicate ccs to a very tough and reliable gamma imaging device under intense radiation conditions , notably the space .",
    "thus , by resolving two serious problems of the mev gamma - ray astronomical observations , we have reached the intrinsic sensitivity determined by its effective area , psf , and the background of cosmic diffuse gammas , as follows .",
    "figure  [ fig : sensitivity ] shows the expected sensitivities of the smile balloon experiments , along with a satellite - etcc consisting of four 50 cm - cubic etccs , which , with its large fov , provides the sensitivity of @xmath12@xmath1710@xmath9  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 at 1 mev for 10@xmath10  s observation , and @xmath13@xmath1710@xmath55  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 for continuum gammas with a sensitivity of @xmath110@xmath56 gamma @xmath3  s@xmath4 for line gamma - rays in 5 years operation ( @xmath7100 times better than those of comptel in 9 years ) , where a duty factor of 0.5 in the operation is assumed .",
    "note that the green and black lines are from the previous results @xcite .",
    "the background observed in smile - i was used for the smile - ii and smile - iii simulations .",
    "for the background for the satellite - etcc , we used the value twice as the extragalactic diffuse gamma flux in 0.15 mev reported with smm @xcite and comptel @xcite , assuming the instrumental background to be at the same level as the extragalactic diffuse gamma .",
    "the psf ( @xmath45 = 1.2@xmath26 ) with the arm and spd resolutions of 2@xmath26 and 5@xmath26 was used for the satellite - etcc , and the psf ( 4@xmath26 ) with the arm and spd resolutions of 5@xmath26 and 25@xmath26 was used for the smile - ii and iii .",
    "one half of the detected gamma - rays from a point source were used in the calculations of the sensitivity .",
    "the application of ml - em to the etccs may improve the sensitivities by several factors .",
    "however , it is not essential because we successfully provide , for the first time , quantitatively reliable sensitivities for ccs without the use of an optimization algorithm like the ml - em method .",
    "thus , satellite - etcc would access the deepest universe in high energy astronomy .",
    "furthermore , with its excellent sensitivity it would detect @xmath115 sne ia / year at distances up to 60 mpc with required statistical accuracy ( section  [ sec : introduction ] ) . for the distances up to 100 mpc , @xmath1500 and nearly a thousand sne/5 years ( @xmath15@xmath8 in 150 days ) would be expected with and without optical coincidence , respectively , with no observational bias , thanks to the large fov and high transparency of mev gammas .",
    "note that this sample should include some collapsars , in which production of @xmath5ni is considered to be less than that in sn ia .    also , the well - defined reconstruction of compton events with low background endows the etcc with an excellent polarimetry ( simulated modulation factors of 0.6 and 0.5 at 200 and 500 kev , respectively ) .",
    "the satellite - etcc would measure @xmath110% polarization ( 3@xmath8 ) for 20 mcrab .",
    "thus , such observations would open a new era of astronomy with distinctive detections of thousands of mev objects .",

    "<S> the energy loss rate ( _ de / dx _ ) , which ccs can not measure , is also obtained , and is found to be indeed helpful to reduce the background under conditions similar to space . accordingly the significance in gamma detection is improved severalfold . on the other hand , spd is essential to determine the point - spread function ( psf ) quantitatively . the spd resolution is improved close to the theoretical limit for multiple scattering of recoil electrons . with such a well - determined psf , we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to provide reliable sensitivity in compton imaging without utilizing an optimization algorithm . as such </S>",
    "<S> , this study highlights the fundamental weak - points of ccs . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast we demonstrate the possibility of etcc reaching the sensitivity below @xmath2  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 at 1 mev . </S>"
