    "while it is well - known that a squid behaves as if it was a single effective junction with a tunable josephson energy when pair tunneling is discussed , additional conductance requirements are set by the inclusion of quasiparticle excitations . classically speaking , a non - vanishing phase - dependent conductance can be achieved in a conductance - asymmetric squid , while assuming that the physical junctions have equivalent critical currents  @xcite .",
    "summation of dissipative currents yields a representation as an effective junction with an effective leakage conductance @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the leakage conductance of the @xmath92th physical junction , and an asymmetry term for the phase - dependent current of @xmath93  @xcite .    to use the effective junction picture in the main text in association with quasiparticle tunneling",
    ", we assume strong asymmetry @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",
    "hence , the dissipative flow is effectively only through a single junction , while the total pair current can still be cancelled .",
    "this allows for the effective junction picture to be used for describing quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "since the ambegaokar - baratoff relation implies for equivalent critical currents that @xmath96 , with @xmath97 is the superconducting gap of the electrodes of the @xmath92th physical junction of the squid , this assumption can be enforced by demanding @xmath98 .",
    "weakening the assumption would require the degrees of freedom of the individual physical qubits to be included in the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "this means that the quasiparticle tunneling hamiltonian would have to be given for each physical junction separately , resulting in two separate decay channels , which allows for the weaker conductance discrepancy to manifest .",

    ".    _ quasiparticle - induced average shift of the system transition frequency._ the existence of quasiparticles induces an average frequency shift for the system that can be attributed to two different mechanisms  @xcite : the quasiparticle renormalization of the josephson energy and the quasiparticle - mediated virtual transitions between different energy levels . in general , each physical junction generates different shift terms , since nonvanishing total quasiparticle current requires conductance asymmetry ( see previous section ) and , hence , different superconducting gaps for the electrodes of the junctions ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , our assumption of strong conductance asymmetry ( @xmath116 ) implies that the frequency shift is dominated by the junction with large quasiparticle flow , so we denote the effective gap by @xmath117 . the renormalization term comprises of contributions from the pair tunneling and josephson counterterms ( @xmath118 ) , as well as the terms in the quasiparticle tunneling hamiltonian that do not contribute to pure dephasing and relaxation  @xcite .",
    "since these contributions are renormalized josephson energy terms for the individual junctions , they vanish for our effective junction . for a nonvanishing josephson term",
    ", the quasiparticle contribution can be approximated knowing the cp - density - normalized quasiparticle density @xmath119 and the energy mode occupation of the quasiparticles at the gap @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the energy mode of the lead quasiparticle distribution function  @xcite .    by using the assumptions detailed in the main manuscript , the principal contribution from the virtual transitions to the @xmath92th energy level of the system",

    "( [ eq : qp_shift3 ] ) , the validity of this assumption is determined by the details of the execution of the low  energy limit given in the main text hindering it and the execution of the phase  regime as well as typical low quasiparticle densities supporting it .",
    "note that in thermal equilibrium and at low temperatures @xmath139 , it is straightforward to support our statement that the frequency shift is dominated by the junction with large dissipative flow ( @xmath116 ) using eq .",

    "_ pure dephasing._ for our system , whose memristive operation relies solely on a weak but nonvanishing dissipative current generated by the quasiparticle  induced decay , pure dephasing adds another decoherence channel and , might potentially destroy the memristive behavior",
    ". its effect would be to both distort the hysteresis loops by adding another time - dependent contribution to the quasiparticle current and to increase the memory - dependent damping of the average voltage by contributing to the total dephasing .",
    "even though our squid is necessarily asymmetric as explained earlier , the individual junctions are assumed symmetric throughout this work .",
    "thus , one would estimate pure dephasing using the self - consistent rate @xmath142 in eq .",

    ". this yields @xmath145 , which is of the order @xmath130 , while the relaxation rate scales as @xmath146 .",
    "a full comparison of the relaxation and pure dephasing rates would require knowledge of the quasiparticle distribution to calculate the quasiparticle spectral density in eq .",

    "this implies that the _ secondary _ terms in the rate equations in ref .",
    "@xcite can typically be omitted , since they are negligible in comparison to the primary terms we use throughout this work .",
    "however , our system crosses points during the phase - driving process in which the primary terms vanish and the secondary terms become the dominating contributions , ensuring that the total rates are nonvanishing .",
    "for example , the secondary term in the relaxation rate is proportional to @xmath152 , which reaches its maximum value at the point of vanishing primary term proportional to @xmath153 , that is , at @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "even though the secondary terms dominate near these points , we assume that their contribution to the total dissipative flow during the full driving cycle is negligible due to the aforementioned assumptions .",
    "if low characteristic quasiparticle energies can not be guaranteed , the full rate equations should be applied to study the potentially modified memristive function .",

    "the same decay that enables hysteresis is responsible for the gradual decrease of the quasiparticle current due to dephasing .",
