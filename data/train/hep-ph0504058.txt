    "several experimental collaborations at @xmath7 and @xmath8 colliders presented data on the differential cross section @xmath9 for the inclusive production of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 mesons , @xmath3 baryons , and their charge - conjugate counterparts . at desy hera ,",
    "such data were collected by the zeus collaboration @xcite in low-@xmath10 @xmath7 collisions , equivalent to photoproduction , and by the h1 collaboration @xcite in deep - inelastic @xmath7 scattering . at the fermilab tevatron ,",
    "such data were taken by the cdfii collaboration @xcite in @xmath8 collisions .",
    "on the theoretical side , fragmentation functions ( ff s ) for the transitions @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes a generic charmed hadron , are needed as nonperturbative inputs for the calculation of all the cross sections mentioned above .",
    "such ff s are preferably constructed by using precise information from @xmath13 via @xmath5 annihilation at the @xmath14-boson resonance , where @xmath15 denotes the hadronic rest . in this process ,",
    "two mechanisms contribute with similar rates : ( i ) @xmath16 decay followed by @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) fragmentation ; and ( ii ) @xmath19 decay followed by @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) fragmentation and weak @xmath22 decay of the bottom - flavored hadron @xmath23 .",
    "the latter two - step process is usually treated as a one - step fragmentation process @xmath24 .",
    "using aleph @xcite and opal @xcite data on inclusive @xmath25 production at the @xmath14-boson resonance , we determined separate ff s for @xmath26 and @xmath27 in collaboration with binnewies @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to extract nonperturbative ff s for @xmath28 from the respective data samples collected by the opal collaboration at lep1 @xcite using the same theoretical framework as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the work in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the qcd - improved parton model implemented in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath4 ) renormalization and factorization scheme in its pure form with @xmath29 massless quark flavors , which is also known the as the massless scheme @xcite or zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme . in this scheme ,",
    "the masses @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the charm and bottom quarks are neglected , except in the initial conditions of their ff s .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies @xmath32 in @xmath5 annihilation or transverse momenta @xmath33 in @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering , if the respective ff s are used as inputs for the calculation of the cross sections for these reactions .",
    "hence , we describe the @xmath11 transitions by nonperturbative ff s , as is usually done for the fragmentation of the up , down , and strange quarks into light hadrons .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , we briefly recall the theoretical framework underlying the extraction of ff s from the @xmath5 data , which has already been introduced in refs .  @xcite . in sec .  [",
    "sec : three ] , we present the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ff s we obtained by fitting the respective lep1 data samples from opal @xcite at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the massless scheme and discuss their properties . in sec .  [ sec : four ] , we present predictions for the inclusive production of these @xmath12 hadrons in nonresonant @xmath5 annihilation at lower c.m.energies and compare them with data from other experiments .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : five ] .",
    "our procedure to construct lo and nlo sets of @xmath34 ff s has already been described in refs .  @xcite . as experimental input ,",
    "we use the lep1 data from opal @xcite .    in @xmath5 annihilation at the @xmath14-boson resonance , @xmath12 hadrons",
    "are produced either directly through the hadronization of charm quarks produced by @xmath16 or via the weak decays of @xmath23 hadrons from @xmath19 . in order to disentangle these two production modes , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite utilized the apparent decay length distributions and energy spectra of the @xmath12 hadrons . because of the relatively long @xmath23-hadron lifetimes and the hard @xmath20 fragmentation , @xmath12 hadrons originating from @xmath23-hadron decays have significantly longer apparent decay lengths than those from primary production .",
    "in addition , the energy spectrum of @xmath12 hadrons originating from @xmath23-hadron decays is much softer than that due to primary charm production .",
    "the experimental cross sections @xcite were presented as distributions differential in @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the measured energy of the @xmath12-hadron candidate , and normalized to the total number of hadronic @xmath14-boson decays . besides the total @xmath12 yield , which receives contributions from @xmath37 and @xmath38 decays as well as from light - quark and gluon fragmentation , the opal collaboration separately specified results for @xmath12 hadrons from tagged @xmath38 events . as already mentioned above ,",
    "the contribution due to charm - quark fragmentation is peaked at large @xmath39 , whereas the one due to bottom - quark fragmentation has its maximum at small @xmath39 .",
    "for the fits , we use the @xmath39 bins in the interval @xmath40 $ ] and integrate the theoretical cross sections over the bin widths used in the experimental analysis . for each of the four charmed - hadron species considered here , @xmath41",
    ", we sum over the two charge - conjugate states as was done in ref .  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no difference between the ff s of a given quark and its antiquark . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we take the starting scales for the @xmath12 ff s of the gluon and the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 quarks and antiquarks to be @xmath46 , while we take @xmath47 for the ff s of the bottom quark and antiquark .",
    "the ff s of the gluon and the first three flavors are assumed to be zero at their starting scale . at larger scales",

    "the ff s of the first three quarks and antiquarks coincide with each other at all scales @xmath48 .",
    "we employ two different forms for the parameterizations of the charm- and bottom - quark ff s at their respective starting scales . in the case of charm",

    "equation  ( [ eq : peterson ] ) is particularly suitable for ff s that peak at large values of @xmath39 , as is typically the case for @xmath17 transitions .",
    "since the @xmath24 ff is a convolution of the @xmath20 fragmentation and the subsequent @xmath22 decay , it has its maximum at small @xmath39 values .",

    "we observe that the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which characterize the shape of the bottom ff , take very similar values for the various @xmath12 hadrons , which are also similar to those for the @xmath25 meson listed in table  i of ref .  @xcite . on the other hand , the values of the @xmath61 parameter , which determines the shape of the charm ff , significantly differ from particle species to particle species . in the @xmath25 case @xcite , our lo ( nlo ) fits to aleph @xcite and opal @xcite data , which required separate analyses , yielded @xmath64 ( 0.185 ) and 0.0851 ( 0.116 ) , respectively .",
    "we observe that , for each of the @xmath12-hadron species considered , the lo results for @xmath61 are considerably smaller than the nlo ones .",

    "the fractional energy spectra of inclusive @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 production was also measured in nonresonant @xmath5 annihilation at lower energies .",

    "@xcite ) , @xmath2 ( table  iv in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath3 ( table  v in ref .",

    "@xcite ) , and @xmath2 ( table  i in ref .",
    "@xcite ) data at slac pep with @xmath69  gev ; and the tasso collaboration took @xmath2 ( fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) data at desy petra with @xmath70  gev .",
    "it is instructing to confront these data with lo and nlo predictions based on our new ff s , so as to test the scaling violations predicted by the dglap evolution equations .",
    "an especially interesting situation arises for the cleo data @xcite , from which all @xmath12 hadrons coming from @xmath23-hadron decays are excluded by appropriate acceptance cuts , so that only @xmath71 quark flavors are active and a direct test of the charm - quark ff s is feasible .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath3 data explicitly refer to the decay channels @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , and we have to divide them by the corresponding branching fractions . for this , we use the up - to - date values @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite , except for the @xmath2 data of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case , for consistency",
    ", we adopt the value @xmath76 from ref .",
    "@xcite itself .",
    "the differential cross sections @xmath77 for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 hadrons measured by cleo @xcite ( circles ) , hrs @xcite ( squares ) , and tasso @xcite ( diamonds ) are confronted with our lo ( dashed lines ) and nlo ( solid lines ) predictions in figs .  [",
    "fig : xs1](a)(d ) , respectively .",
    "let us first concentrate on our nlo predictions .",
    "as for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 mesons , we observe that our nlo predictions generally lead to a satisfactory description of the experimental data , both in normalization and shape .",
    "in particular , the maxima of the measured @xmath39 distributions are approximately reproduced .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath3 baryon , the predicted @xmath39 distribution appears to be too hard , its peak being set off by approximately @xmath78 relative to the one shown by the experimental data . in particular , the data points at 0.55 and 0.65 are poorly described by the nlo prediction .",
    "although the @xmath3 baryon is 22% heavier than the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , and 16% heavier than the @xmath2 meson , mass effects are unlikely to be responsible for this disagreement , since @xmath68  gev is sufficiently far above the charm threshold .",
    "let us now include the lo predictions in our considerations .",
    "the cleo data @xcite , which are most precise , clearly favor the nlo predictions , while the lo predictions are too large at small values of @xmath39 and too small in the peak region .",
    "unfortunately , the hrs @xcite and tasso @xcite data do not reach the small-@xmath39 regime , where the lo and nlo predictions depart from each other , and their errors are too large in order to support this observation .    actually , the cleo data @xcite are considerably more precise than the opal data @xcite , which we fitted to , and it would be desirable to also include them in ours fits .",
    "however , we refrain from doing so for the time being because their high precision would make it necessary to properly treat finite-@xmath79 effects , which are neglected altogether in the theoretical formalism employed here .",
    "the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme @xcite , which has recently been extended to inclusive @xmath80-hadron production in @xmath81 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath8 @xcite collisions , provides a rigorous theoretical framework that retains the full finite-@xmath79 effects while preserving the indispensible virtues of the factorization theorem @xcite , namely the universality and the dglap @xcite scaling violations of the ff s entailing the resummation of dominant logarithmic corrections . a global analysis of experimental data on inclusive @xmath12-hadron production in the gm - vfn scheme is left for future work .",
    "the opal collaboration presented measurements of the fractional energy spectra of inclusive @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 production in @xmath14-boson decays based on their entire lep1 data sample @xcite .",
    "apart from the full cross sections , they also determined the contributions arising from @xmath38 decays .",
    "this enabled us to determine lo and nlo sets of ff s for these @xmath12 hadrons .",
    "as in our previous analysis of @xmath25 ff s @xcite , we worked in the qcd - improved parton model implemented in the pure @xmath4 renormalization and factorization scheme with @xmath29 massless quark flavors ( zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ) .",
    "this scheme is particularly appropriate if the characteristic energy scale of the considered production process , _ i.e. _ , the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath82 in the case of @xmath5 annihilation and the transverse momentum @xmath83 of the @xmath12 hadron in other scattering processes , is large compared to the bottom - quark mass @xmath31 .",
    "owing to the factorization theorem , the ff s defined in this scheme satisfy two desirable properties : ( i ) their scaling violations are ruled by the timelike dglap equations ; and ( ii ) they are universal . thus , this formalism is predictive and suitable for global data analyses .",
    "we verified that the values of the branching and average momentum fractions of the various @xmath11 transitions evaluated at lo and nlo using our ff s are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding results from opal @xcite and other experiments @xcite .",
    "we tested the scaling violations of our ff s by comparing the fractional energy spectra of inclusive @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 production measured in nonresonant @xmath5 annihilation at @xmath68  gev @xcite , 29  gev @xcite , and 34.7 @xcite with our lo and nlo predictions to find reasonable agreement .",
    "since events of @xmath12-hadron production from @xmath23-hadron decay were excluded from the data samples at @xmath68  gev , we obtained a clean test of our charm - quark ff s .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the fit results for the input parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : peterson ] ) and ( [ eq : standard ] ) , including the value of peterson s @xmath61 parameter , are highly scheme dependent at nlo , and must not be navely compared without careful reference to the theoretical framework which they refer to .",
