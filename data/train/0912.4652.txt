    "one of the remarkable properties of the supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model is the possibility to obtain nice unification of gauge couplings at the gut scale . by means of one - loop renormalization group analysis of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in the beginning of 90s of the last century",
    "the scale of susy breaking ( ) compatible with the unification at @xmath5 was `` predicted '' @xcite . at present modern computer codes",
    "( softsusy @xcite , suspect @xcite , spheno @xcite , ffmssmsc @xcite ) routinely use two - loop renormalization group equations ( rge ) to calculate the spectrum of superparticles given high energy input for susy breaking parameters .",
    "it is obvious that rge at higher loops become a system of coupled differential equations so even to study gauge coupling unification one needs to know the value of other , e.g. yukawa , couplings .",
    "since for the moment the mass of an elementary particle is the only source of information about its coupling to higgs boson(s ) , fermion masses are important low - energy input for all the models beyond the sm .",
    "top quark , bottom quark and tau - lepton are considered to be the heaviest fermions known in nature . in the context of the mssm heavy ( @xmath0 and @xmath6 )",
    "quark masses were studied in literature and leading two - loop relations between pole and running masses were found@xcite .",
    "the pole mass does not depend on the renormalization scale @xmath7 @xcite so the running masses can in principle be extracted from it at any value of @xmath7 . however , in practice the scale should be tuned in a proper way to avoid large ( high - order ) radiative corrections .    at the electroweak scale ( @xmath8 )",
    "the top - quark pole mass @xmath9 can be used to find the value of the running mass @xmath10 defined in -renormalization scheme@xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath11 and there are no large logarithms in the relation .",
    "the story becomes more involved if one considers @xmath0-quark and @xmath1-lepton .",
    "in a theory with many different mass scales @xmath12 it is not so easy to avoid the appearance of large contributions in the form of @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 corresponding to masses of light and heavy particles .",
    "this is a `` non - decoupling feature '' of minimal ( -like ) renormalization schemes @xcite . in our case",
    "we have @xmath16 and there are large logarithms in the relations .",
    "moreover , for @xmath0-quark there is a renormalon ambiguity@xcite that limits the precision of experimental pole mass determination .    in order to solve the problem",
    "one usually employ the concept of effective field theory ( see , e.g. , ref .   for a review ) and perform `` manual '' decoupling of heavy particles .",
    "the procedure is well - known in the context of qcd  @xcite ( see also a nice program rundec@xcite ) .",
    "this approach allows one to relate running parameters in well - established effective theory and corresponding parameters in a more fundamental theory by means of so - called decoupling constants which can be calculated order by order in perturbation theory . in some sense",
    "decoupling constants absorb leading contribution of heavy particles to various low - energy quantities . for the @xmath0-quark two - loop @xmath17 contribution to the relation between  and  due to strong interactions",
    "was obtained within mssm in refs .  .",
    "it is known from one - loop@xcite and two - loop@xcite calculations that strong corrections with virtual supersymmetric particles can be significantly reduced by contributions due to other interactions . in this paper",
    "the results for two - loop corrections proportional to yukawa couplings of heavy sm fermions @xmath18 with @xmath19 will be presented .",
    "contrary to the quark masses leptons do not have large uncertainties due to confinement so tau - lepton pole mass can be extracted from the experiment with high precision @xmath20 ( see e.g. ref .  ) .    in principle",
    "this fact allows one to determine the value of the running mass ( or equivalently yukawa coupling ) very precisely . in the mssm",
    "only one - loop supersymmetric contribution to the relation between pole   and running   masses is known@xcite .",
    "the value of the correction depends on parameters of the mssm and in some cases can be of the order of 10% .",
    "clearly , in comparison with the experimental uncertainty one - loop contribution is rather big .",
    "so it seems to be a good idea to calculate two - loop corrections .",
    "moreover , a general reasoning tells us that the inclusion of the two - loop result allows one to reduce the dependence of the final result on the renormalization ( or decoupling ) scale @xmath7 .",
    "why decoupling constants are important in studying a theory beyond the sm ?",
    "together with renormalization group equations ( rge ) they allow one to use a power of -like schemes in studying high - energy behavior of the mssm . according to formal perturbation theory in order to obtain the value of , e.g. , mssm @xmath0-quark running yukawa coupling @xmath21 at the gut scale with @xmath22-loop precision one needs to perform a matching of an effective theory ( e.g. , sm or even fermi theory ) with more fundamental mssm at @xmath23-loop level somewhere at the electroweak ( or susy ) scale .",
    "so for one - loop rge analysis decoupling constants are trivial and running parameters are continuous when one crosses a threshold of some heavy particle .",
    "the situation becomes more involved when two- or three - loop rges are employed .",
    "the parameters obtain a non - zero shift at the scale at which a heavy particle is decoupled . as it was mentioned above",
    "many codes use two - loop rges and one - loop decoupling corrections are incorporated .",
    "it should be pointed out that there exist a dilemma at which scale to decouple heavy particles and how many particles to decouple at chosen scale .",
    "the problem is that when we cross the threshold and decouple a particle we sometimes break a symmetry that guarantees the equality of coupling constants that enter different interaction vertices in a lagrangian .",
    "for example , decoupling of only one squark breaks the supersymmetry which relates the interaction of quarks , gluino and squarks to that of quarks and gluons . as a consequence",
    ", one needs to introduce a new coupling constant in the effective theory without the squark .",
    "this coupling coincide with the strong coupling constant @xmath24 above the decoupling scale @xmath25 but is not equal to @xmath24 below @xmath25 .",
    "of course , the difference can be calculated . however ,",
    "when one goes from the mssm to the sm and decouples every heavy superparticle at its mass a bunch of intermediate effective theories are produced with different symmetries broken ( it can also be @xmath2 symmetry of the sm ) with different rge equations and different threshold corrections .",
    "this way is certainly not the optimal one . in order to make use of all the symmetries presented in full theory during calculation of threshold corrections",
    "it seems to be a good idea to match the sm directly to the mssm ( `` common scale approach '' ) @xcite .",
    "so we are left with the issue of choosing the decoupling scale .",
    "a common choice is  scale .",
    "( see , e.g.  refs .  ) .",
    "clearly , at  high order terms can become important .",
    "moreover , there exist some mssm scenarios@xcite when masses of scalar superparticles significantly differ from that of fermion superparticles . in this case",
    "high order corrections can also improve the precision of calculation .",
    "in fact , in the context of mssm rges are known up to three loops@xcite , . the analysis presented in ref .",
    "was based on one - loop threshold ( decoupling ) corrections and it was mentioned the necessity of two - loop results for self - consistent study .",
    "the results presented in this paper together with that obtained earlier@xcite are aimed to partially fix this mismatch .",
    "the paper organized as follows .",
    "first of all , the approximation to the mssm ( so - called gauge - less limit ) is described in section  [ sec : gaugeless ] .",
    "a special attention is paid to the tadpole diagram treatment in section  [ sec : tadpoles ] .",
    "then a brief review ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : details_calc ] ) of decoupling procedure is presented . section  [ sec : results ] is devoted to the results and numerical analysis of the calculated contribution in a wide range of parameter space of the mssm . in the end of the paper conclusions and acknowledgments can be found .",
    "in order to simplify the decoupling procedure as an effective theory i considered a theory of free tau - lepton and five - flavor qcd with massive bottom - quark . due to smallness of electroweak gauge coupling",
    "i neglected them .",
    "moreover , the lightest higgs boson is assumed to be much heavier then the bottom quark and tau - lepton so it is  left  in the mssm .    in the effective theory",
    "we employ @xmath26 minimal renormalization scheme and have the following set of running parameters : mass of the tau - lepton ( ) , mass of the @xmath0-quark ( ) and strong coupling constant ( @xmath27 ) . by means of well - known technique @xcite",
    "they can be related to the parameters of the mssm defined in so - called -scheme transition can be solved be decoupling of unphysical @xmath28-scalars in a way presented in ref .   or by a two - step procedure given in ref .",
    "] .    in such a simple setup decoupling corrections to the tau - lepton mass",
    "coincide with the corrections that enter the relation between the  and the pole mass . due to strong interactions for the @xmath0-quark we have to take into account the difference between  and .    since i neglected electroweak gauge interactions in the effective theory it is convenient to do the same thing in the mssm .",
    "this approximation is called a gauge - less limit of the mssm@xcite .    in this limit",
    "there is no mixing between gauginos and higgsinos so only the latter have to be taken into account . both charged and",
    "neutral higgsinos have the same mass that is equal to the absolute value of the supersymmetric higgs mixing parameter @xmath29 . which corresponds the positive contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "] the mixing matrices for chargino ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and neutralino ( @xmath32 ) are given by the following expressions @xmath33    it should be mentioned that in higgs sector we can have a problem since in the mssm quartic interaction of higgs bosons are proportional to the electroweak gauge couplings .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper i assume that there is a successful electroweak symmetry breaking so higgs bosons have non - trivial vacuum expectation values and treat the gauge - less limit in a formal way .",
    "it is fair to say , that i am not going to be completely self - consistent within the limit . in the next section , higgs sector of the gauge - less version of mssm",
    "will be discussed together with an issue related to so - called tadpole diagrams .",
    "as it will be shown , in our case we have a very degenerate situation in higgs sector with four massless bosons and four bosons with equal masses .",
    "clearly , this is not satisfactory from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "in the mssm like in the sm the electroweak symmetry is broken by a vacuum state , which can be characterized by the vacuum expectation values @xmath34 and @xmath35 of two higgs doublets @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38    in the true vacuum the first derivative of the effective potential ( tadpole ) should vanish . however , naive calculation of one - loop tadpoles for neutral -even higgs bosons @xmath39 and @xmath40 shows that they do not vanish .",
    "this can be interpreted in the following way .",
    "the vacuum expectation values for the higgs bosons that we substituted in the tree - level higgs potential minimize the tree - level potential instead of effective one .    in order to deal with the problem",
    "i adopt the reasoning of refs .  .",
    "tree - level tadpoles for @xmath41 and @xmath42 that appear in the mssm lagrangian after substitution of look like @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are gauge @xmath46 couplings ( they will be neglected in what follows ) and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are soft supersymmetry breaking parameters of the higgs potential@xcite . both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are assumed to be non - zero and serve as counter - terms to cancel loop - induced tadpoles . as a consequence ,",
    "i do not need to consider diagrams with tadpole insertions like in refs .   since they are precisely canceled by the tree - level counter - term .",
    "however , they do not disappear completely and manifest themselves in the mass matrices of all higgs bosons . in the gauge - less limit mass matrices have the following form ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) @xmath53    since @xmath49 and @xmath50 should cancel loop - induced tadpoles they are at least @xmath54 with @xmath44 being some coupling constant of the theory . consequently , in order to obtain tree - level mass matrices one should set @xmath55 and diagonalize only first term in .",
    "clearly , this matrix has two eigenvalues @xmath56 and it is diagonalized by the rotation with angle @xmath57 .",
    "as it was mentioned in the end of the previous section this is not a satisfactory result .",
    "i decided to be slightly more close to the mssm and introduce different masses for all physical higgs bosons together with a different mixing angle @xmath58 for @xmath59-even states @xmath60 after tree - level diagonalization linear and quadratic parts of the higgs potential can be rewritten in the following way : @xmath61 here @xmath40 , @xmath39 are neutral -even higgs bosons , @xmath62 and @xmath63  neutral -odd higgs and goldstone boson correspondingly , @xmath64 and @xmath65  charged higgs and goldstone bosons .",
    "additional contributions to mass matrices come from @xmath66 ( see eq .  ) and can be expressed in terms of rotated tadpoles @xmath67 @xmath68 a vacuum expectation value @xmath69 , and higgs mixing angles @xmath70 @xcite    [ tadmass ] @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 for some angle @xmath74 . since the contribution due tadpoles does not depend on external momenta it can be taken into account by introduction of additional non - minimal counter - terms for higgs masses and mixing .    in the end of this section",
    "i would like to mention another issue related to goldstone bosons . in the gauge - less limit",
    "there are no gauge bosons to `` eat '' goldstones so the latter are massless and the global @xmath46 symmetry prevents them to acquire mass .",
    "however , in perturbation theory it is not so obvious .",
    "for example , if one does not take into account the contributions during calculation of goldstone boson self - energies @xmath75 non - zero masses for @xmath63 and @xmath65 are immediately generated since @xmath76 .",
    "it worth mentioning that we also run into a problem with spurious infra - red ( ir ) divergences when we try to calculate feynman integrals with @xmath77 insertions .",
    "the role of tadpoles is crucial here since they precisely cancel this non - zero contribution keeping goldstone bosons massless .    in deriving the result presented here i was using non - zero masses for goldstone bosons denoted by @xmath78 and @xmath79 which allows me not to deal",
    "with mentioned ir problem explicitly .",
    "this can be justified since in the full mssm when linear @xmath80-gauge is employed goldstone boson masses are proportional to that of corresponding gauge bosons .",
    "this introduces gauge dependence in the result .",
    "however , numerical analysis shows that the dependence is negligible if one takes into account tadpole contribution .",
    "the process of obtaining decoupling corrections for @xmath0-quark mass is described in great details in ref .  .",
    "i closely follow the same procedure . here",
    "i would like to stress some of important steps of the calculation .    in order to obtain a final result for the relation between running masses in the mssm and our effective theory we need to know so - called `` bare '' decoupling - constants @xmath81 up to two - loop level .",
    "these constants relate bare parameters in the effective five - flavor qcd ( underlined parameters ) to that of the mssm @xmath82 and depend on bare coupling constants @xmath83 and on bare masses of heavy particles denoted collectively by @xmath84 .",
    "the needed relations can be derived from by proper renormalization of the left- and right - hand sides . since @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "are defined in different theories we have @xmath87 as a consequence an implicit equation @xmath88 can be solved in perturbation theory by expressing @xmath89 in terms of @xmath90 and expanding the result in @xmath90 .",
    "simple power counting tells us that in our case we need to know @xmath91 and @xmath92 up to one - loop level and both @xmath93 s  up to two loops .",
    "renormalization constants for the mssm parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be found in  [ app : ren_const ] .",
    "the expressions for @xmath94 that were used in my calculation looks like @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 being quadratic casimirs of @xmath98 group .",
    "the renormalization constants can be easily obtained , e.g. , from the formula @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and well - known rges for yukawa couplings @xmath21 , @xmath101 , and vacuum expectation value @xmath34 ( see refs .  ) .",
    "corresponding expressions for @xmath102 defined in five - flavor qcd can be found in refs .  .",
    "as it was mentioned earlier @xmath103 in our approximation .",
    "since there is @xmath104 in the right - hand side of we also need one - loop relation between @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this relation together with the expressions for full mssm one - loop threshold corrections can be found in appendix d of ref .  .",
    "in order to derive needed @xmath106 contribution to the fermion mass decoupling constants self - energies presented in this reference have to be expanded in external momenta and masses of the considered fermion and the mixing has to be taken into account .",
    "we are left with the only missing piece of the formula , i.e. , two - loop contribution @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "corrections of the order @xmath4 were found in refs .  .",
    "the contribution proportional to yukawa couplings of heavy sm fermions is obtained in this paper by means of a form@xcite program specially written for calculation of decoupling constants in the mssm .",
    "corresponding diagrams were generated with the help of feynarts@xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for tau - lepton strong interactions do not contribute to the mass decoupling constant at two - loop level so the corrections are relatively small in this case .",
    "typical value of two - loop corrections @xmath109 with @xmath110 for low values of @xmath3 is @xmath111 % which is small even with respect to relative experimental error of the pole mass @xmath112 ( @xmath113 % ) . with the increase of @xmath3 considered contribution",
    "is enhanced and can reach the value of few percents ( see fig .",

    "[ sec : tadpoles ] . figure  [ fig : sps1_sps4 ] shows the dependence of @xmath114 contribution to @xmath115 on goldstone boson mass @xmath78 for sps1 and sps4 scenarios @xcite .",
    "one can see that if we neglect tadpole contribution we overestimate the value of the correction and introduce significant dependence on @xmath78 which can be interpreted as a gauge dependence .",
    "the biggest experimental facility in the world , large hadron collider @xcite , has already been built and we are waiting for first physical run of the machine .",
    "we hope that there will be something that allow us to solve at least some of the problems of the sm and we believe that it will be supersymmetry .",
    "the mssm is a viable candidate for a theory beyond the sm .",
    "it has a lot of parameters most of which related to supersymmetry breaking and they have to be determined from future experiments .",
    "however , other parameters are already constrained from known low - energy input .",
    "both bottom - quark and tau - lepton masses are among them .",
    "in this paper the relations between corresponding running masses @xmath116 and @xmath117 defined in the mssm and known low - energy experimental input ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 were considered .",
    "two - loop ( decoupling ) corrections to this relations proportional to yukawa couplings of heavy sm fermions were calculated .    for the @xmath0-quark",
    "it was found that @xmath114 corrections are important for large @xmath3 and significantly reduce two - loop strong contribution calculated earlier @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : b_strong_vs_yukawa ] one can see that mentioned contributions usually have different signs . with the increase of @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) absolute value of the corrections increases ( decreases ) .",
    "due to this kind of behavior they tend to compensate each other in the whole region of considered @xmath122 plane lowering the sum below current uncertainty in the input parameter @xmath118 .",
    "two - loop threshold corrections to @xmath1-lepton mass that were obtained in this paper turns out to be negligible in the region of low @xmath3 . with the increase of @xmath3",
    "they can reach the value of few percents and exceed the experimental error of @xmath112 .    from the presented analysis it is obvious that the two - loop decoupling corrections are too small and can not significantly modify mssm spectrum produced by public computer codes .",
    "variations in the spectrum due to calculated corrections are comparable with variations due to uncertainties in the low - energy input parameters .    nevertheless , obtained result allows us to be sure that , e.g. for large @xmath3 one - loop approximation is good enough . moreover , if some new physics is established at lhc we will be ready to perform precision tests of susy models and their gut extensions with the help of three - loop rges .",
