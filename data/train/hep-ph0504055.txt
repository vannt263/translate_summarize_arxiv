    "the parameter @xmath7 enters a variety of quantities which are determined from experiment with an enormous precision .",
    "in particular , it enters the relation between the @xmath2-boson mass , @xmath8 , the fine structure constant , @xmath9 , the fermi constant , @xmath10 , and the @xmath1-boson mass , @xmath11 , which is given by  @xcite @xmath12 the quantity @xmath13 is conveniently parameterized in the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 contains contributions from light fermions giving rise to a correction of about 6% .",
    "the leading corrections proportional to @xmath18 are incorporated in @xmath7 and amount at one - loop order to roughly @xmath19% whereas the remaining part is small .",

    "we can also look at the change of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle , @xmath21 , defined through the coupling of the @xmath1-boson to leptons .",
    "the leading universal corrections originating from @xmath7 can in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq::delmw ] ) be written as @xmath22    currently the uncertainties for @xmath8 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath23  mev and @xmath24  @xcite , respectively . however",
    ", a future linear collider running at the @xmath1-boson pole , the so - called giga-@xmath1 option , and around the @xmath2-pair threshold might reduce the uncertainties to @xmath25  mev and @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop corrections to @xmath0 have been computed in 1977  @xcite and also the two - loop qcd corrections are known since almost 20 years  @xcite .",
    "roughly 10 years ago the order @xmath27 qcd corrections  @xcite constituted one of the first applications of the three - loop massive vacuum integrals . at three - loop order for the first time a new kind of feynman graphs",
    "has to be considered , the so - called singlet diagrams as shown in fig .  [ fig::sing ] which only contribute to the @xmath1-boson self - energy .",
    "they are characterized by the fact that in contrast to the non - singlet contribution the external @xmath1-bosons couple to different fermion lines .",
    "we want to note that the singlet contribution forms a finite and gauge independent subset . at three - loop order it completely dominates the numerical corrections if the @xmath28 definition is adopted for the top - quark mass . in the case of the pole mass definition",
    "the singlet part still amounts to about 30% of the total three - loop contribution .",
    "we want to mention that also two - loop  @xcite and three - loop mixed electroweak / qcd  @xcite and even three - loop pure electroweak corrections  @xcite have been evaluated .",
    "recently also corrections in the large higgs boson mass limit have been considered  @xcite . for non - universal corrections",

    "[ fig::sing ] some sample diagrams are shown .",
    "this constitutes one of the first applications of the four - loop vacuum master integrals evaluated recently in ref .",
    "since the boson self - energies have to be evaluated for zero external momentum and only qcd corrections are considered , only the axial - vector part of the @xmath1-boson correlator gives a non - zero contribution .",
    "whereas for the non - singlet contribution the naive anti - commuting definition of @xmath29 can be adopted , special care has to be taken in the singlet case . actually , the definition of t  hooft and veltman  @xcite has to be adopted and additional counterterms have to be introduced in order to ensure the validity of the ward identities . in the practical calculation",
