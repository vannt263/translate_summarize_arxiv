    "in 2011 , the measurement by the cdf collaboration of an anomalous forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry in @xmath0 production at the tevatron drew a great attention into top quark physics and , in particular , it fostered the theoretical studies of top quark properties ( see  @xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "the deviations in the fb asymmetry are smaller in some of the latest measurements using the full tevatron dataset .",
    "but , irrespectively of the reason behind these deviations  new physics , systematic bias or statistical fluctuations ",
    "the related developments are very interesting on their own . here",
    "we will focus on top polarisation observables , which provide a good opportunity to detect elusive new physics in top pair and single top production .",
    "we will begin by setting the theoretical framework , and then proceed to discuss some polarisation observables for the tevatron and for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the top quark is not a stable particle but it decays mainly into a @xmath1 boson and a @xmath2 quark , with a predicted average life of @xmath3 s. for a process in which a top quark is produced and subsequently decays into @xmath4 , for example @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 denoting possible additional particles ) , the amplitude contains an @xmath7-channel top propagator . since the top quark width @xmath8 is small compared to its mass @xmath9 , one can approximate the propagator as  @xcite @xmath10 in standard notation  @xcite , with @xmath11 the top quark momentum and @xmath12 its helicity .",
    "then , the amplitude is decomposed as @xmath13 , a sum of production ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 decay ( @xmath16 ) factors , summed over the possible top helicities . taking the modulus squared of the amplitude",
    ", the differential cross section can be written as @xmath17 .",
    "the product @xmath18 can be identified with the top spin density matrix , which for a spin-@xmath19 particle can be written in general as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is defined as twice the expected value of the three spin operators , @xmath22 . in the present case",
    "we have chosen the @xmath23 axis in the helicity direction , but the other two axes are not yet specified .",
    "@xmath24 is a vector in three - dimensional space , satisfying @xmath25 in general , and @xmath26 if , and only if , the top quarks are produced in a pure spin state .",
    "here is worth recalling that :    1 .   the differential cross section",
    "_ can not _ be decomposed into production @xmath15 decay in general , since in general the off - diagonal elements in @xmath27 are non - vanishing .",
    "however , note that one can always choose a reference system @xmath28 where @xmath27 ( a hermitian matrix ) is diagonal .",
    "the off - diagonal elements involve the top quark polarisations @xmath29 , @xmath30 in directions @xmath31 , @xmath32 orthogonal to the @xmath23 axis .",
    "3 .   in the helicity basis",
    "these off - diagonal elements are given by the interference of helicity amplitudes with @xmath33 .",
    "4 .   the integration over some variables  @xcite can cancel the dependence on @xmath34 ( hence also the effect of the quantum interference of helicity amplitudes ) and in that case the `` classical '' production @xmath15 decay interpretation is correct .",
    "the top quark polarisation can be measured by using the double differential distribution of the charged lepton @xmath35 from the semileptonic @xmath1 decay @xmath36 in the top quark rest frame ( see for example  @xcite ) , @xmath37 with @xmath38 the polar coordinates of the charged lepton 3-momentum @xmath39 in the @xmath28 reference frame .",
    "( here we are ignoring possible @xmath40 anomalous couplings in the top decay . ) after integration over @xmath41 , one recovers the well - known charged lepton polar angle distribution @xmath42 which allows to measure @xmath43 .",
    "notice that integration over @xmath41 eliminates the dependence on @xmath34 , so that for this distribution the production @xmath15 decay interpretation of on - shell top quarks is adequate .    alternatively to the full distribution ( [ ec : dist2d ] )",
    "one can use the one - dimensional polar angle distribution of the charged lepton with respect to the three axes  @xcite , that is , eq .  ( [ ec : dist1d ] ) plus two more distributions obtained replacing @xmath44 with @xmath45 the angle between @xmath39 and the @xmath46 axis .",
    "these one - dimensional distributions can be experimentally simpler , and the information contained is the same : once the three polarisations are measured the spin density matrix ( [ ec : rho ] ) is completely fixed .    in processes where several top ( anti-)quarks are produced , the replacement ( [ ec : nw ] )",
    "can be done for each of them , which allows for the study of spin correlations in addition to the top polarisation considered here ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "in order to measure the polarisation in the three axes we must specify our reference system , which at the tevatron is rather easy because the @xmath47 collisions offer a privileged direction .",
    "the @xmath31 axis can be taken in the plane spanned by the top quark momentum @xmath48 and the proton momentum @xmath49 in the centre - of - mass ( cm ) frame , and the @xmath32 direction is then orthogonal to that plane .",
    "that is , @xmath50 the @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions are often called respectively `` transverse '' and `` normal '' . the polarisations in these two directions are independent of the longitudinal polarisation @xmath43 usually considered .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 production and , as new physics benchmark , a colour octet with mass @xmath51 gev and arbitrary coupling to the quarks , @xmath52",
    "g_\\mu^a  \\,,\\ ] ] with the condition @xmath53 , _ i.e. _ the left - handed coupling to @xmath54 is the same .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] the longitudinal and transverse polarisation for fixed @xmath55^{1/2 } = 0.1 $ ] , three choices of the chirality of light quark couplings and varying chirality of the top quark coupling .",
    "this plot not only demonstrates that @xmath29 and @xmath43 are independent and worth measuring , but also that @xmath29 can be ( much ) larger than the usually considered polarisation @xmath43 .",
    "the normal polarisation @xmath30 can also be large  @xcite but it requires non - trivial complex phases in the amplitude , which can originate from the @xmath7-channel propagator of the octet if it is very wide .    the same reference system in ( [ ec : xyz ] ) can be used to other processes , _",
    "e.g. _ single top production , but in this case it is unlikely that measurements are feasible at the tevatron given the small size and purity of the signal .",
    "the definition of our reference system  ( [ ec : xyz ] ) is not useful for the lhc because the two colliding hadrons are protons and there is no privileged direction in the initial state .",
    "let us examine this in detail , considering @xmath0 production as in the previous section and choosing the momentum of one of these protons @xmath49 ( fixed ) to build our system as in ( [ ec : xyz ] ) . then , since the initial quark in @xmath56 can come from this proton or the other one , there are relations between the longitudinal , transverse and normal polarisations for scattering at opening angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : xyz ] , @xmath59 notice that we have labelled the reference system for opening angle @xmath60 as @xmath61 to remind the reader that the axis directions are different from the ones for angle @xmath57 .",
    "the relations ( [ ec : rel ] ) imply that after integration over @xmath57 the transverse and normal polarisations vanish .",
    "then , in order to have non - zero @xmath34 , some alternatives have been proposed in the literature .",
    "one is to include a @xmath62 factor in the definition of observables  @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to subtracting the polarisations in the forward minus the backward hemispheres .",
    "an alternative is to select the proton direction on a event by event basis . in @xmath0 production",
    "this can be done by choosing the proton in the direction of the @xmath63 momentum of the @xmath0 pair in the laboratory frame , that is , if @xmath64 we choose the proton with @xmath65 , and conversely  @xcite",
    ". this amounts to guessing , event by event , which proton has provided the initial valence quark . for the benchmark studied in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "the second option leads to larger integrated values of @xmath29 . for illustration ,",
    "we give in table  [ tab:1 ] the transverse polarisations resulting with these two options for a cm energy of 8 tev in the case of right - handed octet coupling to the light quarks and the top quark , and the longitudinal polarisation which is the same in both cases .",
    "we also include the value of @xmath29 that would result if the _ true _ proton providing the valence quark were always chosen . these polarisations are smaller than current systematic uncertainties  @xcite but they can be enhanced by imposing a lower cut on the velocity of the @xmath0 pair @xmath66 .",
    "llll @xmath62 & @xmath67 & & @xmath68 + choose @xmath69 & @xmath70 & ( true @xmath69 : @xmath71 ) & @xmath68 +    for completeness , let us comment that the azimuthal distribution  ( [ ec : dist2d ] ) has also been proposed as an observable sensitive to the top polarisation  @xcite , but using a different reference system @xmath72 with @xmath73 in the direction of a ( fixed ) proton @xmath49 , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "we plot this distribution in fig .",
    "( [ fig : az ] ) for three benchmark points : ( i ) the standard model ( sm ) ; ( ii ) the colour octet in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] with @xmath76 and right - handed coupling to the light quarks ( rr ) ; ( iii ) the same but with vector coupling to the top quark , @xmath77 ( rv ) .",
    "note that in cases ( i , iii ) the longitudinal polarisation @xmath43 is zero , while the transverse polarisation @xmath29 is nonzero for ( ii , iii ) .    according to eq .",
    "( [ ec : dist2d ] ) , the azimuthal distribution is sensitive to @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the `` alternative '' reference system @xmath72 , so one might be led to consider that with this definition of the axes one is able to measure the transverse and normal polarisations ( but in other directions @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) even if the proton direction has been arbitrarily fixed . however , as we can clearly see in fig .",
    "[ fig : az ] , the distribution is only sensitive to @xmath43 in the helicity direction , as it can be expected from the relations in  ( [ ec : rel ] ) .",
    "therefore , the azimuthal distribution in this reference system does not offer any information independent from @xmath43 .    in @xmath82-channel single top production one has the same ambiguity to choose between the two proton directions .",
    "however , one can guess which one provided the initial quark by the direction of the spectator jet in the laboratory frame  @xcite , which is very forward and following the initial quark direction in most cases .",
    "this choice gives a correct identification 95% of the time for the production of top quarks , and 90% for the production of top antiquarks , thus allowing for potentially clean measurements of the transverse and top polarisations in single top production .",
