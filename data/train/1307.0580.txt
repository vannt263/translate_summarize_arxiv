    "the past several years has seen a growing interest in nanowires ( nws ) such as sinws@xcite , genws@xcite , and gaasnws because of their excellent optoelectronic properties @xcite . as few examples ,",
    "recent experimental work @xcite on the photocurrent response of freely suspended single 140 nm gaasnws has shown current as high as @xmath10.45 na for a titanium : sapphire laser light intensity of 100 @xmath2 . experimental work on the effect of strain on gaasnws , approximately 80 nm in diameter@xcite , and theoretical work on much smaller diameter sinws@xcite ,",
    "have also shown a direct - to - indirect bandgap transition , which can potentially be used for laser applications . at the same time , it has also been found that surface passivation of the gaasnw with al@xmath3ga@xmath4as increases the photoluminescence ( pl ) lifetime , and minority carrier diffusion lengths , significantly@xcite .",
    "the bandgap in genws is also found to be dependent upon the type of surface passivation as well as strain @xcite , which has a consequence on the optoelectronic response of the nw .",
    "concomitantly , gaas p - i - n nw structures have also shown excellent solar power harvesting capability@xcite . the above results (",
    "as well as several references contained therein ) highlight the significance of obtaining a detailed understanding of the photo response of nws and 1d devices .",
    "as these nanostructures are being used for image photo detectors , calculations of the photo current response become important .",
    "of particular importance is the behavior of smaller diameter nws , in keeping with the trend towards smaller feature sizes . over the years",
    "several theoretical work have been reported to understand the optoelectronic response of nws@xcite .",
    "just to name a few advanced works in the field of negf coupled to photonic field which recently appeared are the works of aerberhard et al.@xcite , steiger@xcite and henrickson et al.@xcite and stewart et.al @xcite which use either tight binding(tb ) or bulk 2d * k * @xmath0 * p * modeling . the limitation of the tb is the system size , whereas the limitation of the bulk 2d * k * @xmath0 * p * system is applicability to 2d systems such as quantum wells , superlattices . in this work",
    "we discuss an approach suitable for modeling the photo current response of sub-10 nm diameter nws .",
    "the basis of our work is the band structure calculation by utilizing a 1d 4x4 * k * @xmath0 * p * model , with transport calculations utilizing non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism . for small structures , semiclassical simulations , such as monte carlo ,",
    "are reasonably accurate , but they may not capture the details of charge distribution in its entirety , particularly in the problem being addressed . on the other hand , negf based quantum mechanical approach may provide a more accurate estimation especially in the phase - coherent regime .",
    "moreover , negf allows to incorporate phase - breaking(not considered here ) processes vis self - energies .",
    "to our knowledge this is the first work which couples 4x4 * k * @xmath0 * p * and negf to compute the photo response of the 1d nanostructures .",
    "we have used 4x4 * k * @xmath0 * p *",
    "( applicable to direct band gap materials ) to keep things simple , although conceptually there is no restriction and the model can be easily transferred to the indirect band - gap materials such as si , ge by using a larger dimensional * k * @xmath0 * p * such as 15x15 , 24x24 , 30x30 * k * @xmath0 * p * models for sub-10 nm 1d devices .",
    "this approach takes into account correlations between different band indices as well as spatial correlation allowing us to study the effect of non - locality of electron - photon self - energy .",
    "we believe that the proposed method provides a good compromise between computational speed and modeling complexity .",
    "the paper is divided into different sections .",
    "section ii focuses on the theory , particularly band structure calculation , electron - photon interaction , transport formalism , as well as mode - space approach and physical observables . device setup and numerical parameters",
    "are discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv comprises of results and discussion , and conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "starting point of the work was the calculation of the band structure using the original kane @xcite 4x4 * k * @xmath0 * p * scheme and using gaas as a representative material .",
    "for the computation of the photoresponse ( discussed below ) , we use a modified 2x2 scheme ( or two subband model ) .",
    "originally * k * @xmath0 * p * was done for the direct bandgap materials , although usage of it has been extended to indirect bandgap materials ( si and ge)@xcite , and one can adapt the present method to originally indirect bulk materials .",

    "the manifestation of the franz - keldysh effect is the non - zero current below fundamental bandgap . in pa regime",

    "one should mention that under certain bias conditions , it is possible to have spontaneous emission even for the small - sized devices@xcite . for our system to experience it , one would go beyond 1.4ev as we have checked in the range of our biases , and no contributions have been seen .",

    "one can see that going from @xmath161=1.4 ev to @xmath161=1.64 ev , the channel current increases with respect to band - edge currents due to increase of available dos .",
    "on the other hand , at @xmath161=1.76 ev current in diode flows near band - edges .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by spatial oscillations of ldos .",
    "the photo - current is mainly due to carrier photo - generation and inter - subbband recombination .",

    "[ fig : cbvb - b ] one can see oscillations in the hole and electron current density along the length of the device .",
    "figure [ fig : cbvb - c ] is richer in features such as curvature change over the diode length .",
    "these features can be explained by the local generation - recombination rates .",
    "eq.([eq : rr ] ) is basically microscopic analog of the macroscopic balance equation@xcite .",
    "left hand side represents divergence of the particle current(electron ) , in our case it is just photo - current due to ballistic photo - extracted carriers .",
    "right hand side is the energy and volume integrated local generation recombination rates .",
    "it can be rewritten in the form of eq s .",
    "( [ eq : rr1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rr2 ] ) . now physical origin of these terms becomes clear . by looking at r.h.s of the eq.([eq : rr2 ] ) one can see two terms .",
    "first one corresponds to the total inscattering rate(generation ) at that energy , whereas second term gives total ouscattering(recombination ) rate at that energy.one should note that by using r.h.s .",
    "of the equation ( [ eq : rr ] ) , and treating particularly first term as inscattering and second as outscattering term may lead to nonphysical features in the local recombination - generation spectra such as appearance of negative inscattering .",
    "although , physical origin of this phenomena is unclear , but we believe it is due to a fact that coherence length in our case is infinite since we are working within ballistic regime . including non - radiative phase - breaking mechanisms such as phonon - scattering and working in the limit where mean - free path is smaller than device region should remove this problem . @xmath162",

    "this indicates that no photocurrent is being generated in the channel region , which is in agreement with figure [ fig:2ds - e ] .",
    "by tuning the @xmath161 one can make the diode channel conducting or contact conducting(regions just below valence band and above conduction band ) .",
    "this is also seen in the profiles of the electron and hole currents at different photon energies .",
    "finally , we also investigate the effect of the non - locality of the @xmath100 and it-s effect on the current densities .",
    "it is important to note that recursive implementation will fail in this case since it only accounts for the first off - diagonal terms . as can be seen in fig.[fig : offd ] , by keeping only 2-off diagonal blocks we have a value of the current which is @xmath165 of the total current , which is in agreement with the results of pourfath et .",
    "in addition to this , we have also computed 2d distribution of current density .",
    "it is seen that spatial current oscillations are lost in case of @xmath166 as compared to @xmath167 , where one reconstructs original picture .",
    "the reason for this is wave - like @xcite behaviour of the self - energy which gives phase - coherent response in the limit of the @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is 139 in our case .",
    "phase coherence is lost once just few off - diagonals are retained .",
    "although , some@xcite works consider that only a portion of the device is being illuminated , in this case it can be shown that self - energies @xmath100 become only band - diagonal , thus giving possibility of inclusion of smaller number of off - band diagonal blocks .",
    "we have presented the theoretical framework for the computation the opto - electronic response of the 1d devices in the * k * @xmath0 * p * model , with particular emphasis on the gaas material .",
    "extension of the model from direct bandgap materials to the indirect ones for sub-10 nm 1d systems is straightforward but tedious .",
    "phonon scattering incorporation is straightforward .",
    "it is shown that in the phase - coherent limit one observes carrier ( e , h ) spatial current oscillations .",
    "it has also been - shown that local recombination - generation rates may lead to negative components of the current at the leads , which in itself deteriorates the device performance .",
    "in addition , it was shown that current can flow in the channel region or near the band edges and not in the channel depending on the incident photon energy . moreover",
    ", local generation - recombination rates can form different spatial patterns which is reflected in the features of the photocurrent . moreover",
    ", generation - recombination rates may experience nonphysical behaviour such as negative in - scattering , but we believe this is due to a fact that we are working in the ballistic regime . effect of the non - locality of the self energy is crucial to the computation of the photo - response both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "even two subband model reveals non - trivial behaviour of the electronic response upon light illumination .",
    "numerical results are in reasonable agreement with recent experimental data taking into account number of modes and dimensions of the device .",
    "the future work includes more realistic implementation by incorporating more 1d subbands .",

    "<S> we present theory of the carrier - optical interaction in 1d systems based on the nonequilibrium green s function formalism in the 4x4 * k * @xmath0 * p * model . as a representative parameters we chose the gaas . </S>",
    "<S> although theory is presented in 4x4kp many subbands , results and discussion section is based on the simplified model such as 2x2 kp model ( two transverse modes ) . </S>",
    "<S> even though 2x2 kp model is simple enough it shows many phenomena that have not been seen before . </S>",
    "<S> we focus mainly on the ballistic extraction of photogenerated free carriers at the radiative limit which is described by the self - energy term derived in dipole approximation and solved in self - consistent manner with keldysh quantum kinetic equations . </S>",
    "<S> any relaxation or non - radiative recombination mechanisms as well as excitonic features are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> effect of non - locality of electron - photon self energy term is considered and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous emission is also considered and shown to be small in short devices under medium bias conditions . </S>",
    "<S> electron and hole spatial current oscillations are seen and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that neglecting off - diagonal correlation in the band index not only produces quantitatively wrong results but it also alters the qualitative picture . </S>",
    "<S> all simulations are done in the full - rank approximation , with all spatial and band correlation effects are kept intact . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study not only quantitative effects but also qualitative behaviour . </S>"
