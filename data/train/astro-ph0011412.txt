    "today , as we witness the dawn of a precision era in observational cosmology , we are becoming increasingly aware that our present knowledge and understanding of the galactic foregrounds demand a more thorough underpinning . during the course of this meeting we have learned about the results from the latest experiments for measuring the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . yet , despite their success in ruling out a significant contamination of galactic origin , there are still opened questions regarding the spatial and spectral distribution of the galactic constituents .",
    "new insights have already improved on this picture as the work of lazarian on galactic dust properties and of reynolds on galactic free - free mapping through h@xmath3 association have been able to tell us .",
    "such an effort also lies at the core of the galactic emission mapping ( gem ) project in order to reveal a new look of the galactic synchrotron component , capable of overcoming the well - known shortcomings of the existing surveys ; let alone the important implications for the search of spectral distortions in the cmbr .",
    "the gem project ( de amici et al . 1994 ; smoot 1999 ) was conceived 9 years ago at the xxist iau general assembly in buenos aires , argentina , when an international team of researchers set forth to develop a portable radiotelescope for achieving full - sky coverage between  and . since its first deployment in the owens valley desert near bishop , ca , ( usa ) in 1994 the gem experiment has operated from 3 other locations ( villa de leyva in colombia , tenerife in the canary islands and cachoeira paulista in brazil ) and gathered observations at 4 of the 5 planned frequencies :  ( torres et al .",
    "1996 ) ,  ( tello 1997 ) and   ( torres , internal report , 1997 ) . for the purpose of these proceedings",
    "i will restrict my attention to the data taken at the owens valley and cachoeira paulista sites at  which provide a nearly 75% sky - coverage .",
    "[ fig1 ]    gem s mapping strategy uses a 1-rpm rotating dish to scan the sky around the zenith in @xmath0 wide circles , which due to the earth s rotation provide complete sky coverage of an equally wide declination band ( see fig",
    "the gem radiotelescope consists of a 5.5-m dish and is double - shielded against stray radiation from the ground .",
    "we use a rim - halo to intercept the spillover sidelobes and a wire mesh fence to further cut down and level out the contamination from the ground . by applying a geometric diffraction model to this experimental setup ( tello et al .",
    "1999 ) , together with measurements of the backfire helical feed pattern and selected field scan observations ( tello et al .",
    "2000 ) , we have nailed down the level of ground contamination , which so far has demonstrated to be one of the most significant sources of contamination in survey experiments . the collimated feed pattern has a hpbw of @xmath2 .",
    "the radiometric signal is sampled at nearly half - second intervals by a thermally controlled total power receiver within a 90 bandwidth .",
    "the system temperature is @xmath4 and its gain is @xmath5 .",
    "we have also performed a detailed study of the receiver systematics in order to predict its response to changes in the thermal bath of its components , such that the receiver baseline drifts at @xmath6 and the relative gain change has a thermal susceptability of @xmath7c .",
    "for some 20% of the data collected at  the stability of the receiver guarantees a 95% confidence level of spurious signal rejection due to gain variations on a timescale of 150-minute long observing runs . by keeping the sun and the moon at angles larger than @xmath1 and @xmath8 , respectively , from axis , a total of 8.5% of data had to be purged ; while only 1.6% had to be excised due to rfi signals .",
    "in addition , the firings from a stable noise source diode at 44.8-s intervals were used to correct the received signals .",
    "finally , we applied a de - striping algorithm ( tello 1997 ) to remove low frequency 1/f noise from the remaining observations .",
    "the technique relies on a sampling of the circular scans into networks of 120 half - a - beamwidth wide bins which , when divided into eastern and western sets , become fiducial baselines to calibrate the western and eastern scans that intercept them ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "these calibrated scans can in turn be used to compose further bin networks to the east and west in order to propagate the map baseline across an entire declination band .",
    "this technique presumes , however , the absence of stray radiation from the galactic plane .",
    "we have not yet compensated for this source of systematic effect in the data , which implies in a colder baseline than it should after it has propagated from a warm into a cold region of the sky , but the present status of our work can be best appreciated in the map of fig .",
    "this map combines 63.5 hours of data from the bishop site with 212.65 hours from the brazilian site and has been set to a pixel resolution of @xmath9 spanning an antenna temperature range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in @xmath12 steps .      the gem project , whose principal investigators appear as co - authors in the present contribution , has been the work of an outstanding team of researchers ; mainly m.  bensadoun , m.  limon , g.  de amici , j.  gibson , j.  yamada , c.  witebsky , d.  heine , m.  leung , a.  alves , l.  arantes , c.a .",
