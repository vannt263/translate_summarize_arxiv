    "the conventional charge - based electronics for more than past fifty years has a history of great success@xcite .",
    "however , the proven concept of enhancing the performance metrics by miniaturization@xcite of devices is approaching its fundamental limits@xcite ; while there are issues due to process variation , basically the excessive energy dissipation in the devices limits the further improvement of transistor - based electronics@xcite . the nanoelectronics research initiative",
    "( nri)@xcite at united states says `` future generations of electronics will be based on new devices and circuit architectures , operating on physical principles that can not be exploited by conventional transistors .",
    "nri seeks the next device that will propel computing beyond the limitations of current technology . ''",
    "the challenge is to invent switching devices that dissipate miniscule amount of energy , e.g. @xmath01 attojoule while maintaining sub - nanosecond switching delay .",
    "the performance metric switching delay is particularly important because if transistors were to switch at low switching speed there would not be excessive energy dissipation due to delay - energy trade - off .",
    "this is quite explicitly pointed out by nri while seeking new switching devices over traditional transistors since several proposals could not meet the requirement of switching speed@xcite .",
    "devices made of electron s spin as a state variable are switched by flipping spins without moving any charge in space and causing current flow .",
    "this eliminates the ohmic loss associated with switching , although some energy is still dissipated in flipping spins from one state to another overcoming the switching barrier between the states .",
    "it is widely believed that using `` spin '' as state variable is advantageous over the charge - based counterpart .",
    "unfortunately , however , this advantage will be squandered if the method adopted to switch the spin is so energy - inefficient that the energy dissipated in the switching circuit far exceeds the energy dissipated inside the switch .",
    "regrettably , this is often the case , e.g. switching spins with a magnetic field@xcite or with spin - transfer - torque mechanism@xcite using an external charge current@xcite .",
    "hence , there is a need for inventing a switching mechanism to flip spins for the paradigm of spintronics to be technologically viable .",
    "according to brown s fundamental fine - ferromagnetic - particle theory@xcite , magnetic domain formation should be limited to very small dimensions ( @xmath0100 nm ) because of the competition between the magnetostatic energy and the quantum - mechanical exchange energy , causing nanomagnets to behave like single giant spins .",
    "these `` giant '' spins can beat superparamagnetic limit at room - temperature@xcite , which is crucial for general - purpose information processing .",
    "the minimum energy dissipated to switch such a single - domain nanomagnet ( a collection of @xmath1 spins ) can be only @xmath0@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is temperature and @xmath4 is error probability , since the exchange interaction between spins makes @xmath1 spins rotate together in unison like a giant _ classical _ spin@xcite . on the contrary , the minimum energy dissipated to switch a charge - based device like a transistor would be @xmath0@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of information carriers .",
    "this gives nanomagnets an _ inherent _ advantage over the traditional transistors with regards to energy dissipation .    in _ multiferroics",
    "_ , different ferroic orders such as ferroelectric , ferromagnetic / ferrimagnetic , ferroelastic etc . coexist . for our discussion",
    ", we will assume the coexistence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders to mean mutiferroism .",
    "single - phase multiferroic materials are rare and moreover the magnetoelectric responses of those is very weak or occur only at low temperatures so their technological applications is not yet very promising@xcite . on the contrary , 2-phase multiferroic _ composites _ consisting of magnetostrictive layers strain - coupled with piezoelectric layers@xcite",
    "do not have the bottlenecks as of their single - phase counterparts .",
    "thus multiferroic composites are more promising for technological applications .",
    "the magnetization of the shape - anisotropic single - domain magnetostrictive nanomagnet in multiferroic composites can be switched in less than 1 nanosecond while dissipating only @xmath01 attojoule@xcite .",
    "hence such devices have emerged as potential candidates as storage and switching elements for our future non - volatile memory and logic systems . particularly due to high switching speed",
    "while simultaneously being highly energy efficient , this has lead to logic proposals incorporating such systems@xcite .",
    "the magnetization of the nanomagnet has two stable states ( mutually anti - parallel ) along the easy axis encoding the binary bits 0 and 1 .",
    "the magnetization can be switched from one stable state to the other when a tiny voltage of few tens of millivolts is applied across the piezoelectric layer while constraining it from expanding or contracting along its in - plane hard - axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multiferroic ] ) .",
    "the applied voltage produces a strain in the piezoelectric layer , which is then transferred to the magnetostrictive layer .",
    "this in turn generates a uniaxial stress in the magnetostrictive nanomagnet along its easy - axis and rotates the magnetization towards the in - plane hard axis as long as the product of the stress and the magnetostrictive coefficient is _",
    "negative_. it is assumed by convention that a tensile stress is positive and a compressive stress is negative .",
    "there have been experimental efforts to demonstrate such electric - field induced magnetization rotation@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the model for such multiferroic straintronic devices . the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation is solved to track the magnetization dynamics and to calculate the associated performance metrics like switching delay and energy dissipation . also , we present the model for determining magnetization dynamics in a circuit made of multiple multiferroic devices .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the simulation results for both a single memory device and a circuit of multiple multiferroic devices .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes this review and provides the outlook of the multiferroic straintronic devices on building nanoelectronics for our future information processing paradigm .",
    "in this section , we will first review the model of a single multiferroic device",
    ". the emphasis would be on magnetization dynamics of the magnetostrictive nanomagnet in a multiferroic composite by solving landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xcite .",
    "we will review the model incorporating room - temperature thermal fluctuations using _ stochastic _ llg equation@xcite .",
    "then we describe how the same model can be used for _ unidirectional _ signal propagation in a chain of multiferroic devices@xcite .",
    "how we can build logic gates for computational purposes is described too in the end .",
    "we consider a single isolated nanomagnet in the shape of an elliptical cylinder with its elliptical cross section lying in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ; the major axis is aligned along the @xmath8-direction and minor axis along the @xmath7-direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multiferroic ] ) .",
    "the dimensions of the major axis , the minor axis , and the thickness are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "so the magnet s volume is @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath8-axis is the easy axis , the @xmath7-axis is the in - plane hard axis and the @xmath13-axis is the out - of - plane hard axis . since @xmath14 ,",
    "the out - of - plane hard axis is much harder than the in - plane hard axis .",
    "let @xmath15 be the polar angle and @xmath16 the azimuthal angle of the magnetization vector in standard spherical coordinate system .",
    "note that when @xmath17 = @xmath18 , the magnetization vector lies in the plane of the nanomagnet .",
    "any deviation from @xmath17 = @xmath18 corresponds to out - of - plane excursion .",
    "we can write the total energy of the magnetostrictive single - domain nanomagnet when it is subjected to uniaxial stress along the easy axis ( major axis of the ellipse ) as the sum of the uniaxial shape anisotropy energy and the uniaxial stress anisotropy energy@xcite .",
    "we assume that the magnetostrictive layer is polycrystalline , so that we ignore the magnetocrystalline energy .",
    "the uniaxial shape anisotropy energy at an instant of time @xmath19 is given by@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the saturation magnetization and the demagnetization factor @xmath22 is expressed as@xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the m@xmath25 ( m = x , y , z ) component of the demagnetization factor@xcite .",
    "note that these factors depend on the dimensions of the nanomagnet and not on the material properties .",
    "the dimensions of the nanomagnet is chosen as @xmath9 = 100 nm , @xmath10 = 90 nm and @xmath11 = 6 nm , which ensures that the nanomagnet has a single ferromagnetic domain@xcite .",
    "these dimensions alongwith the material parameter saturation magnetization @xmath21 determine the shape anisotropy energy barrier , which separates the two stable states of the nanomagnet .",
    "the in - plane energy barrier @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : multiferroic ] ) , which is the _",
    "lowest _ difference between the shape anisotropy energies when @xmath28 and @xmath29 determines the _",
    "static _ error probability of spontaneous magnetization reversal due to thermal fluctuations .",

    "this probability should be low enough for technological application purposes . with the dimensions and material chosen , @xmath26 = 44 @xmath31 at room temperature , so that the static error probability at room temperature is @xmath32 .",
    "note that the _ dynamic _ error probability on the other hand signifies the switching error probability when magnetization fails to flip from one state to another during switching events .",
    "usually the _ dynamic _ error probability can be much higher than that of _ static _ error probability .",
    "so we must put emphasis on this _ dynamic _ error probability to meet the demand of technological viability .",
    "the stress anisotropy energy is given by@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnetostriction coefficient of the magnetostrictive nanomagnet and @xmath35 is the stress generated in it by an external voltage .",
    "a positive @xmath36 product will favor alignment of the magnetization along the major axis ( @xmath8-axis ) , while a negative @xmath36 product will favor alignment along the minor axis ( @xmath7-axis ) , because that will minimize @xmath37 .",
    "we will use the following convention that a compressive stress is negative and tensile stress is positive .",
    "therefore , in a material like terfenol - d that has positive @xmath38 , a compressive stress will favor alignment along the minor axis , and tensile along the major axis",

    "note that @xmath74 does not depend on the component of the random thermal field along the @xmath8-axis , i.e. @xmath75 , which is a consequence of having @xmath8-axis as the easy axis of the nanomagnet .",
    "however , once the magnetization direction is even slightly deflected from the easy axis , all three components of the random thermal field along the @xmath13- , @xmath7- , and @xmath8-direction would come into play .",
    "when no stress is applied on the magnetostrictive nanomagnet , magnetization would just fluctuate around an easy axis provided that the shape anisotropy energy barrier is enough high to prevent spontaneous reversal of magnetization from one state to another in a short period of time .",
    "we can solve the eqs .   and   while setting @xmath76 = 0 to track the dynamics of magnetization due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "so this will yield the distribution of the magnetization vector s initial orientation when stress is turned on . since the most probably value of magnetization is along easy axis , the @xmath44-distribution is boltzmann peaked at @xmath44 = 0@xmath77 or 180@xmath77 , while the @xmath17-distribution is gaussian peaked at @xmath27 because these positions are minimum energy positions@xcite .",
    "stress is ineffective when @xmath44 is around 0@xmath77 or 180@xmath77 , i.e. when magnetization is around the easy axis ( mathematically , note that the expression in eq .",
    "is proportional to @xmath78 , which is zero when @xmath44 is equal to 0@xmath77 or 180@xmath77 ) .",
    "hence , we would get a long tail in the switching delay distribution should magnetization starts very near from easy axis .",
    "when we start out from @xmath29 , we have to wait a while ; thermal fluctuations may help here while getting started but random thermal kicks may also cause magnetization to traverse towards the opposite direction than the intended dirction of switching .",
    "thus , switching trajectories initiating from near easy axis may be very slow .",
    "we do need to worry about the switching delay _ tail _",
    "more than _ mean _ switching delay since the extent of tail will set the requirement of pulse width of stress for switching to take place with sufficiently high probability .    in order to eliminate the long tail in the switching delay distribution , we can apply a static bias field that will shift the peak of @xmath79 distribution away from the easy axis , so that the most probable starting orientation will no longer be the easy axis@xcite .",
    "this field is applied along the out - of - plane hard axis ( + @xmath13-direction ) and the potential energy due to the applied magnetic field can be expressed as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the magnitude of magnetic field .",

    "if we somehow change the magnetization direction of one nanomagnet , the magnetization of the other nanomagnet would _ not _ automatically change its direction to assume an antiferromagnetic order .",

    "it s true that antiferromagnetic order is the ground state , however , during operation of devices , we must remove the barrier and then again restore it to make sure that antiferromagnetic order is maintained .",
    "magnetization may come to antiferromagnetic order after a very long time depending on the barrier height but the operation of devices can not be dependent on that .    in general , we need to propagate a logic bit _ unidirectionally _ along a chain of nanomagnets .",
    "it requires a clock signal to periodically reset the magnetization direction of each nanomagnet .",
    "if a global magnetic field is utilized for such a purpose , it would not allow pipelining of data , and magnetization of every nanomagnet must be maintained along hard axis until a bit propagates .",
