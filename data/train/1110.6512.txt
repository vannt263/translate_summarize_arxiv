    "black hole candidates ( bhcs ) are very important objects for the understanding of accretion and jets in high energy astrophysics ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "most of them are close x - ray binaries consisting of a black hole and a low mass companion ( cyg x-1 , lmc x-1 and x-3 are persistent high mass exceptions ) characterized by outbursts separated by quiescent periods . during a typical outburst , they go through the hard state ( or low / hard state ) , steep power - law state ( spl ; or very high state ) , intermediate state ( ims ) , and thermal state ( or high / soft state ) , then the hard state and back to the quiescence , although some other state classifications are present ( e.g. soft - intermediate and hard - intermediate state in @xcite ) .    in the hard state ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum can be approximately explained by a power - law with an exponential cutoff at 100200 kev .",
    "the power spectrum is characterized by strong variability ( 2030 % ) with band - limited noise .",
    "the hard x - ray emission likely originates from thermal comptonization in a high temperature corona ( @xmath410@xmath5 k ) of soft photons from the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal state spectrum is dominated by a soft component which is considered to be a blackbody from the geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk ( @xmath410@xmath6 k ) .",
    "this x - ray spectrum is well fit by the multi - color disk ( mcd ) model ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and also by more accurate accretion disk models ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) which have been developed to take into account relativistic effects .",
    "the derived innermost radius from the mcd model typically remains constant at a value which might correspond to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , from which an estimate of the bh mass can be found .",
    "thus derived , black hole mass from x - ray data is found to be consistent with the bh mass estimated from the binary kinematics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the two main states , both the spl and ims are not well understood .",
    "they frequently appear during state transitions between the hard and thermal states .",
    "both disk and power - law components are clearly present in the energy spectra , and the power spectra show strong time variability associated with low - frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) , seen at 0.110 hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "several types of lfqpos have been identified and classified into type a , b and c by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "type a and b qpos are characterized by a relatively low coherence ( the coherence parameter @xmath73 for type a and @xmath86 for type b ) and a narrow frequency range of 18 hz associated with a weak red - noise component .",
    "features for the type - c qpos include a high coherence parameter ( @xmath810 ) , a variable frequency ( 0.110 hz ) , and strong broadband noise under the qpo .",
    "the study of lfqpos is essential to our understanding of the spectral state transitions in bhcs , but their origin is still a topic of debate .",
    "a new hard x - ray transient was first discovered as gamma ray burst ( grb ) 100925a on september 25 , 2010 ( mjd 55464 ) by the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "the gas slit camera ( gsc ; @xcite ) on board the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ; @xcite ) independently detected this x - ray transient and localized it to ( ra , dec)=(16@xmath959@xmath1010@xmath11 , 15@xmath121605  ) with a 0.2 degree accuracy @xcite . the source was designated as maxi j1659152 .",
    "the maxi / gsc data showed that , unlike normal grbs , the x - ray flux rapidly increased following the discovery .",
    "rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; @xcite ) follow - up observations revealed the source as a bhc from spectral and timing properties @xcite .",
    "due to the swift bat prompt grb trigger and the source s location well above the galactic plane , many multi - wavelength observations including radio @xcite , submm bands @xcite , near - infrared @xcite , optical @xcite , x - rays and gev gamma - rays @xcite have been carried out since the discovery .",
    "the xmm - newton , rxte , and swift data revealed the presence of x - ray dips in their light curves with a period of 2.41 hours ( @xcite , 2011 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude modulation with this period was also confirmed by the optical data in the vsnet - team report @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that maxi j1659152 has the shortest orbital period among all the black hole candidates ( the second shortest one is 3.2 hours for swift j1753.50127 @xcite ) .",
    "several x - ray results have already been reported in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we shortly summarize results from these four groups who published spectral and timing results using the same rxte and swift data sets .",
    "@xcite showed a bhc signature based on the hardness - intensity diagram @xcite and timing properties including the lfqpo classification . at almost the same time , @xcite reported on detailed timing properties , including time lags for qpos .",
    "these two papers mainly focus on timing properties , although they performed spectral fitting with a simple model , i.e. wabs*(diskbb@xmath13powerlaw ) .",
    "@xcite performed spectral fits with the bulk - motion comptonization model ( bmc in xspec ; @xcite ) , and estimated a bh mass of 20@xmath143 m@xmath15 and a distance of 7.6@xmath141.1 kpc using the spectral - timing correlation scaling technique .",
    "results from swift / uvot , xrt and bat data covering mjd 55464 ( day 0 ) to 55491 ( day 27 ) were reported by @xcite .",
    "they have detected x - ray dips and type - c qpos at 0.151.9 hz , particularly during the initial phase of the outburst , and performed broadband fits with xrt and bat data .    in this paper , we report on detailed spectral modeling and combined spectral and timing results using 8 ( quasi ) simultaneous swift / xrt and rxte / pca observations , as well as the same rxte data sets . in sections",
    "[ obsdata ] and [ results ] , we describe the rxte follow - up observations and details of spectral and timing analysis of the data .",
    "we also show spectral results from swift / xrt and rxte / pca observations . in section",
    "[ discuss ] , we discuss how our results compare with those from other bhcs , an estimation of the black hole mass of maxi j1659152 from spectral results alone , and the physical origin of the low frequency qpos .",
    "finally , we will conclude this paper with a summary .",
    "following the swift and maxi discovery of maxi j1659152 , we triggered rxte target of opportunity ( too ) observations approved in the ao14 open - time program to reveal its nature .",
    "our follow - up observations started on september 28 , 2010 , and two other programs were triggered after our observations and continued until november 8 , 2010 , when the source was not observable due to the sun constraint of the satellite .",
    "these series of observations contain 65 pointed observations under the observation ids 95358 , 95108 and 95118 .",
    "the net deadtime - corrected pca exposure was 134.6 ksec , with an averaged exposure of about 2.1 ksec per pointed observation .",
    "the rxte carries three scientific instruments : the proportional counter array ( pca ; @xcite ) , the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; @xcite ) , and the all - sky monitor ( asm ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pca consists of five identical proportional counters ( pcu 04 ) which are sensitive in the 2100 kev range , while the hexte is composed of two identical nai(tl)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillators ( we distinguish the detectors as cluster a and b ) which are sensitive in the 15250 kev range .",
    "all three instruments are still active and working well in space since the launch in december 1995 .",
    "we analyzed the rxte data using the standard ftools , headas version 6.9 , provided by nasa goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) .",
    "for the pca spectral analysis , we used the standard 2 mode data , which has 16 sec time resolution and 129 energy channels .",
    "the selection criteria were : ( 1 ) the offset angle is larger than 0.02 degrees ; ( 2 ) the elevation from the earth is larger than 10 degrees ; ( 3 ) the pcu2 is active ; and ( 4 ) there are no pcu breakdowns .",
    "we accumulated the energy spectra from only the top layer of the pcu2 .",
    "dip events seen in rxte / pca and swift / xrt data were not excluded in our analysis .",
    "the pca background was estimated from the model for bright sources , which is publicly available at the pca analysis web site .",
    "we performed deadtime corrections ( the detector deadtime is typically 23 % ) , and added a 0.5% systematic error to each energy bin .",
    "based on the improvement to the rxte / pca calibration , the energy range was limited to 350 kev .",
    "xspec version 12.5 was used for spectral fits .",
    "the errors are quoted at statistical 90% error . to check the validity of the current response and our analysis method",
    ", we analyzed a crab observation ( obsid : 95802 - 01 - 18 - 00 ) with a net exposure of 658 sec , taken on october 22 , 2010 during the maxi j1659152 outburst .",
    "the fit is acceptable ( @xmath16/dof=62.0/77 ) , and the crab spectrum in the 350 kev range is explained by a power - law with a photon index of 2.12@xmath140.01 and an observed flux of 2.30@xmath1710@xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 in the 210 kev range , which is consistent with the nominal values @xcite .    for the pca timing analysis , we used the event mode data , which has finer time resolutions than the standard mode data .",
    "the power density spectra ( pds ) were produced using a light curve binned with a 7.8125 msec time resolution ( nyquist frequency : 64 hz ) and powspec in the xronos package .",
    "the pds were normalized to a unit of ( rms / mean)@xmath21 hz@xmath20 after subtracting the poisson noise .",
    "since january 2010 , the pointing directions of hexte cluster a and b have been fixed toward the target position and the 1.5@xmath12-offset background position .",
    "hence , we needed to use the background production tool hextebackest , which predicts the background spectrum for cluster a from that of cluster b. however , the hexte data were not used because the current version of hextebackest still leaves some systematic features at @xmath460 kev in the background - subtracted spectra .",
    "bhcs have a typical innermost disk black - body temperature of @xmath41 kev ( i.e. an emission peak of the blackbody at @xmath42.8 kev ) so we only see a wien tail of the disk blackbody spectrum in the pca energy range above 3 kev . hence , there may be large uncertainties in disk parameter estimations of the mcd model , especially when the disk temperature is lower than @xmath40.6 kev .",
    "we , therefore , performed fits of maxi j1659152 with swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) data , with soft band coverage over 0.310 kev , to obtain reliable disk parameters . in the archived xrt data",
    ", we found 7 observations that were exactly simultaneous to rxte observations , and one ( period h ) that was partially simultaneous .",
    "the list of simultaneous observations and time intervals is shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "all the xrt observations reported in this paper were performed in the windowed timing ( wt ) mode .",
    "the xrt data were analyzed in the public web interface @xcite , and the latest version of the xrt response matrix , swxwt0to2s6_20070901v012.rmf , was used .",
    "the energy range was limited to 0.69 kev taking into account a calibration uncertainty at low energy and photon statistics at high energy .",
    "the rxte / pca pcu2 light curves with a time resolution of 16 sec in four energy ranges ( 24 , 410 , 1020 , 220 kev ) are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the data were normalized to the pcu2 counts for the crab nebula .",
    "the maxi / gsc , the rxte / asm , the swift / bat data were taken from the web sites for each instrument team , and also normalized to the crab and are shown for comparison .",
    "the flux measurements between pca and maxi are consistent with each other .",
    "the soft band flux in the 210 kev range slowly rises with some variability , while the hard band flux rapidly rises within a few days and then slowly decreases .",
    "the approximate e - folding time is about 30 days at high energies .",
    "on october 15 , 2010 , the peak was about 300 mcrab in the 220 kev range , and the total outburst duration was about 65 days , assuming the maxi / gsc and swift / bat data cover the whole outburst .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1.ps",
    "we classified all the observations into accretion states following the definitions in @xcite .",
    "note that our classification is based on fitting results with the wabs*(diskbb+powerlaw ) model in the 350 kev range , with a cutoff and iron line during some of the early observations .",
    "we found that all the observations were classified into just two states : 58 imss and 7 hard states .",
    "neither the thermal state nor the spl state were observed .",
    "the source was initially in the hard state for @xmath44.1 days , then transitioned into the ims , where it remained for 32 days .",
    "it finally returned to the hard state around mjd 55503 ( day 39 ) .",
    "no intense power - law flares as seen in , e.g. , xte j1550564 @xcite and h 1743322 @xcite were observed .",
    "we first fit the pca spectra with a disk blackbody ( or mcd model ; @xcite ) plus a power - law modified with the galactic absorption ( i.e. wabs*(diskbb+powerlaw ) ) which are typical components in the x - ray spectra of bhcs .",
    "however , a reflection - like structure was found above 7 kev . in addition , a high energy cutoff was required at 3040 kev in some observations during the initial phase of the outburst .",
    "hence we used the model wabs*(diskbb+smedge*cutoffp ) ( hereafter model a ) throughout all the data . the hydrogen column density ( @xmath22 ) in wabs was fixed at the galactic value of 1.7@xmath1710@xmath23 @xmath19 @xcite following @xcite since the pca can not determine @xmath22 due to the lack of low energy sensitivity . using a slightly higher value of 3@xmath1710@xmath23 @xmath19",
    "( see section [ xrtpcafit ] ) , we found that the fitting results did not change significantly .",
    "the energy and the width of the smeared edge @xcite were fixed at 7.11 kev and 10 kev due to the neutral iron - k edge .",
    "the averaged @xmath24 is 56.5 for 73 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) and the maximum @xmath16 is 86.5 , suggesting that our spectral fits are reasonable .",
    "we also tried two other spectral models , wabs*(diskbb+cutoffp+gaussian ) and wabs*(diskbb+pexrav ) , using a narrow gaussian line at 6.4 kev or a reflection component instead of the smeared edge .",
    "however , we found that model a gives better fits than these two models ( the average @xmath16 is 63.3 and 57.9 for 72 d.o.f . for wabs*(diskbb+cutoffp+gaussian ) and wabs*(diskbb+pexrav ) , respectively ) .",
    "to show the time variation of spectral and timing parameters over the course of the outburst , we selected 8 observations including 2 hard states and 6 imss as representatives .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath25 spectra for them .",
    "time variation of the spectral parameters ( innermost diskbb temperature @xmath26 , innermost radius @xmath27 , proportional to the square root of @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is the normalization of the diskbb model , @xmath2 is the inclination angle ( face - on for @xmath2=0@xmath12 ) , and @xmath29 is the distance to the source . ]",
    "( hereafter we assume @xmath29=10 kpc and @xmath2=0@xmath12 for simplicity when quoting @xmath27 ) , photon index @xmath30 , and e - folding energy @xmath31 ) , the disk flux , the cutoff power - law ( cpl ) flux , and the total flux in the 220 kev range are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that the observed @xmath26 and @xmath27 are not physical because of the spectral hardening due to the electron scattering in the innermost part of the accretion disk and also the lack of the innermost boundary condition in the mcd model ( see section [ discuss2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath26 increases from @xmath40.5 to a peak of @xmath40.8 kev ( day 18 ) , and then drops down to 0.5 kev in the decaying phase . during the initial and final phases , where the source is mainly in the hard state , the @xmath27 shows some variations with large error bars .",
    "although the fits require the disk component , the disk estimation might have large uncertainties due to a low sensitivity below 3 kev of rxte / pca ( see section [ xrtpcafit ] ) .",
    "in fact , we directly compare the @xmath26 measured by swift / xrt published in @xcite , and found that the differences were significant during the hard state ( 0.50.6 kev for the pca versus 0.30.4 kev for the xrt ) .",
    "@xmath26 never exceeds 1 kev , which has been observed in bright bhcs ( e.g. gro j165540 @xcite , h 1743322 @xcite , and xte j1550564 @xcite ) . in spite of variations of @xmath26 and the disk flux , the innermost radius @xmath27 remains constant at @xmath430 km .",
    "the @xmath30 of the cpl component smoothly varies from 1.6 to 2.4 and then back to 1.6 . during a few observations in the initial phase , a high energy cutoff at 3040 kev",
    "is required in the fits .",
    "this is a bit low compared with typical values of 100200 kev in the hard state @xcite .",
    "some bhcs show a lower cutoff during the initial bright hard state , which is probably due to the rapid increase of the compton cooling of a high temperature corona by soft disk photons @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis that the coronal temperature is controlled by the disk flux will be discussed later ( see figure [ fig8 ] and  [ discuss1 ] ) .",
    "the flux of the hard cpl component is independent of the disk - flux variation as generally seen in many bhcs .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the hard power - law component diverges at low energies in the wabs*(diskbb+powerlaw ) model .",
    "this situation is unphysical because the power - law spectrum results from the comptonization of disk photons .",
    "hence , they developed a self - consistent comptonization model , simpl , in xspec .",
    "because the power - law component of maxi j1659152 remained relatively strong throughout the outburst , we used this model as a more accurate estimation for the disk parameters ( i.e. wabs*smedge*highecut*simpl@xmath32diskbb , where @xmath32 means a convolution  hereafter model b ) .",
    "we used the up - scattering only option in simpl .",
    "the quality of the fitting with this model was almost the same as in model a , yielding an averaged @xmath16 of 56.8 for 73 d.o.f .",
    "the time variation of the fitting parameters is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "model b fits result in larger innermost radii , @xmath27 , than those of model a because the simpl comptonization model takes into account the contribution of the disk photons which are scattered into the power - law component as well as direct disk emission .",
    "the innermost radius is still roughly constant ; there is an initial drop from @xmath450 km to @xmath435 km , where it remains for most of the outburst .",
    "( 140mm,140mm)fig2.ps    ( 80mm,80mm)fig3.ps    ( 80mm,80mm)fig4.ps      we fit the swift / xrt and rxte / pca spectra simultaneously using models a and b described in section [ pcafit ] .",
    "to take into account the calibration uncertainties between the two instruments , the pca spectra were normalized to the xrt spectra , multiplying the pca spctra by a constant factor .",
    "we found that this normalization factor was reasonably consistent with unity within a 20% accuracy .",
    "the hydrogen column density @xmath22 was left free .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the best - fit broadband spectra for 4 out of 8 simultaneous observation periods .",
    "the disk blackbody component becomes more evident later in the outburst .",
    "the fits are reasonable for both models giving reduced chi - squares of 1.01.4 for 360 to 500 d.o.f .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the @xmath22 measured in simultaneous fits is almost consistent with the galactic value 0.17@xmath1710@xmath33 @xmath19 for model b , and model a results in a slightly higher value , by @xmath40.1@xmath1710@xmath33 @xmath19 , than this value .",
    "their time evolution , shown by red symbols in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , displays similar behavior to the results from the rxte data fits .",
    "however , there are significant differences between observations with a lower disk flux than @xmath41@xmath1710@xmath34 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 , mainly during the hard states ; the fits with rxte data alone tend to give significantly higher @xmath26 and smaller @xmath27 than those obtained from the swift+rxte fits .",
    "thanks to the joint broadband data , we deduce the reduction of @xmath27 ( by more than a factor of three from @xmath4110 km to @xmath435 km ) more precisely than that in the preceding section ( from @xmath450 km to @xmath435 km ) . hereafter , we do not discuss the disk parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , obtained from rxte observations alone if the observations had lower disk fluxes than 1@xmath1710@xmath34 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 in the 220 kev range or were classified in the hard state .",

    "the observed e - folding energy is much lower than a typical value in the hard state ( 100200 kev ; @xcite ) , but a low cutoff energy has been seen for several bhcs during the rising phase @xcite , probably due to compton cooling in the corona by soft photons .",
    "this could also indicate a transition of the electron distribution from thermal to non - thermal electrons in the corona , but we can not investigate this issue due to the limited pca energy range up to 50 kev .",
    "we confirmed results from @xcite and @xcite that lfqpos , consisting of type - b and type - c , were observed at 18 hz in 51 of 65 observations .",
    "the lfqpos were seen when both disk and corona components were firmly present , and the disk fraction was less than 35 % ( i.e. the hard cpl component was strong ) . from detailed fits with the simpl comptonization model , we have shown that the type - c qpo central frequency varies from 1.6 hz to 7.3 hz in association with the disk flux , the innermost temperature , the innermost radius , the photon index , and the rms variability , similar to that seen in several bhcs ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we assume that the high temperature , corona - like , advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) is well inside the truncated disk @xcite . when the local mass accretion rate from the outer part of the disk increases , the innermost temperature ( @xmath26 ) and the disk flux ( @xmath112 ) also increase ( see left panel of figure [ fig8 ] ) . as the disk flux increases",
    ", the corona undergoes cooling due to the compton scattering of soft photons from the thin disk , and the compton @xmath113 parameter ( = @xmath114 ) ) gets lower ( i.e. the photon index gets steeper ; see middle panel of figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the innermost radius of the disk is determined by a balance between the accretion rate and the gas evaporation rate @xcite , and so the innermost radius approaches the isco ( 3@xmath111 ( see section [ discuss2 ] ) corresponding to @xmath11535 km ) from around 9.4@xmath111 ( @xmath4110 km ) due to a gradual increase of the mass accretion rate .",
    "@xcite showed that the type - c qpo rms variability increased with x - ray energy for maxi j1659152 .",
    "several authors have derived the same results for other bhcs ( e.g. @xcite ) , naturally implying that the qpo could be of coronal origin .",
    "the observed lfqpo frequency ( 18 hz ) is too slow to be explained by the dynamical time scale @xmath116 ( eq.(3.4 ) in @xcite : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the distance to the bh and @xmath119 is the keplerian velocity ) , but can be explained by the viscous time scale @xmath120 ( @xcite , eq.(3.71 ) in @xcite : @xmath121 where @xmath100 is the viscous parameter and @xmath122 is the height of the corona ) . here",

    "hence , the corresponding frequency to the radius range of 3 to 9.4@xmath111 , 2.011.0 hz , is in a good agreement with the observed frequency at 18 hz .",
    "if the type - c qpo originates from the neighborhood of the disk truncation radius , we can explain the change of the qpo frequency by a change of the innermost radius .",
    "in fact , the observed @xmath27-@xmath98 correlation ( @xmath124 ) is remarkably consistent with the above relation @xmath125 .",
    "a larger innermost radius might result in a larger coronal size , that is , a larger contribution of the hard cpl component , which has more variability than the disk emission in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this could explain the anti - correlation between the qpo frequency and rms variability as seen in right panel of figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "in contrast , the frequency of type - b qpos varied from 1.7 to 4.1 hz , while the innermost radius @xmath27 remained constant at @xmath435 km .",
    "the constancy of @xmath27 suggests that the inner edge of the accretion disk had already reached the isco during the type - b qpos .",
    "thus , a change of the frequency can not be explained by a change of the disk innermost radius .",
    "an innermost - radius independent mechanism ( e.g. magnetic reconnection above the thin disk ) is necessary for an explanation of type - b qpos .",
    "the 2010 outburst of maxi j1659152 lasted for about two months , a much shorter duration than many other black hole systems ( typically more than 100 days ; @xcite ) .",
    "this short duration is consistent with the fact that maxi j1659152 is a small system given its relatively short orbital period ( @xmath42.41 hours ; @xcite , 2011 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that all three previously known bhcs with short orbital periods below 6 hours ( swift j1753.50127 ( 3.2 hours ; @xcite ) , xte j1118 + 480 ( 4.1 hours ; @xcite ) , and gro j0422 + 32 ( 5.1 hours ; @xcite ) remained in the hard state during the entire duration of their outbursts . this is probably due to a low mass accretion rate ",
    "small accretion disks tend to accumulate less matter than larger disks @xcite .",
    "as the hardness - intensity diagram seen in @xcite and @xcite clearly displays a q - shaped track during the outburst evolution , maxi j1659152 might be the first bhc with spectral transitions among the short period bhcs .",
    "in addition , all the sources with very short periods are located at high galactic latitudes ( ( @xmath126,@xmath127)=(5.5 , + 16.5 ) for maxi j1659152 , ( 157.7 , + 62.3 ) for xte j1118 + 480 , ( 24.9 , + 12.2 ) for swift j1753.50127 , and ( 165.9 , 11.9 ) for gro j0422 + 32 ) .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 is thought to be a run - away microquasar which is moving at a high speed of about 100 km s@xmath20 @xcite , and may have been born during a supernova on the galactic disk , and then subsequently moved toward the galactic halo by kicks received during the explosion . this might suggest that maxi j1659152 is also a run - away microquasar similar to xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "the long - term monitoring of radio and/or optical observations of the maxi j1659152 source location with high spatial accuracy will be useful for determining the origin of this source . also , the recently discovered bh transient swift j1357.20933 lies well above the galactic plane ( @xmath126,@xmath127)=(328.7 , + 50.0 ) and stays in the hard state throughout the outburst @xcite .",
    "swift j1357.20933 may thus be a short - period black hole candidate @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the innermost radius using the simpl comptonization model , and have found that it started at about 110 @xmath0 km , where @xmath1 is the distance in units of 10 kpc and @xmath2 is the inclination angle , during the initial phase and gradually approached the constant value of @xmath435 @xmath0 km .",
    "this could imply that the innermost radius finally reached the isco @xcite . assuming that the isco coincides with three times the schwarzschild radius ( 3@xmath111 ) , as in the case of a non - spinning schwarzschild bh , we can estimate the mass of the central object in maxi j1659152 . however , we note that the observed innermost radius ( @xmath27 ) does not reflect a physical radius ( @xmath110 ) due to two main effects : the mcd model does not assume the torque - free condition at the innermost radius ; and the emergent spectrum is distorted by a hardening due to the electron scattering , resulting in a blackbody component with a higher color temperature ( @xmath128 ) than the effective temperature ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "we follow the correction method for these two effects that has been developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied the simpl model to energy spectra taken during intermediate states , and showed that the innermost radius can increase when the compton fraction is larger than 0.25 .",
    "so , using the averaged @xmath27 value of 35.3 km for @xmath2=0@xmath12 and @xmath29=10 kpc , weighted for observations with a compton fraction smaller than 0.25 , we can estimate the bh mass as follows :    @xmath130    where @xmath131 is 0.412 @xcite and @xmath132 is the spectral hardening factor ( 1.7 : @xcite ) .",
    "since we assume @xmath110 to be 3@xmath111 ( @xmath111=2@xmath133 ) , the obtained black hole mass @xmath108 is @xmath134    in the case of a rapidly rotating kerr black hole ,",

    "furthermore , it is known that the thermal - to - hard transition will occur at 14 % of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath138 = 1.25@xmath139 erg s@xmath20 ) in soft x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "the observed flux from the hard state after the transition ( mjd 55508 , day 44.1 ) was 1.97@xmath1710@xmath34 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 in the 350 kev range .",
