    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is considered to be the underlying theory of the strong interaction which governs hadron production in nuclear collisions .",
    "the strong interaction is usually divided into soft processes , which involve small momentum transfer , and hard processes , which can be calculated using perturbative qcd . the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) experiments at the brookhaven national laboratory investigate properties and evolution of matter at high temperature and energy density . at rhic energies ,",
    "the hard processes become more evident in comparison to previous heavy ion experiments and can be used to probe the early state of the collision system .",
    "a high energy parton produced via hard scattering may lose energy in the hot / dense medium through gluon bremsstrahlung and multiple scatterings before hadronization  @xcite , leading to a suppression of high @xmath6 hadron production .",
    "the magnitude of the energy loss provides an indirect signature of qgp formation .",
    "since parton energy loss is directly proportional to gluon density , the energy loss would be much larger in a partonic medium than in hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "partonic energy loss can be investigated through comparison of hadron yield as a function of @xmath6 between nucleus - nucleus collisions and @xmath9 or @xmath10 collisions . in order to do so , scaling factors which account for the nuclear geometry , the number of participant nucleons , @xmath11 , and the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath12 , are calculated from theoretical models .",
    "experimental results from rhic , including our earlier analyses in the pseudorapidity region @xmath5 , have indicated a suppression of hadron production for @xmath13 gev/@xmath2 in central au + au collisions relative to @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the sps result from central pb + pb collisions at @xmath14 gev , which shows an excess of @xmath15 production for @xmath16 gev/@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the rhic measurements are striking considering that known nuclear effects , like the cronin effect  @xcite and radial flow  @xcite , tend to enhance hadron yields at high @xmath6 .",
    "the rhic results for high @xmath6 hadron suppression agree qualitatively with calculations based on fragmentation models , which attribute the high @xmath6 hadron suppression to medium induced parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "another known nuclear effect , nuclear shadowing , also modifies particle production at high @xmath17 .",
    "calculations of this effect  @xcite based on the eks98 shadowing parametrization  @xcite predicted it to be small in the @xmath17 and pseudorapidity region covered in this measurement .",
    "however , another study  @xcite found a much larger shadowing effect for heavy nuclei at rhic",
    ". therefore , a measurement of particle production as a function of @xmath17 and pseudorapidity may provide a constraint on the shadowing effect .",
    "partonic energy loss may also be studied by the pseudorapidity dependence of hadron production .",
    "change of pseudorapidity due to change of momentum is @xmath18 the pseudorapidity distributions would be modified as a result of the parton energy loss if the momentum change rate ( @xmath19 ) due to the energy loss is different along the transverse and longitudinal direction .",
    "in addition , polleri and yuan  @xcite pointed out that the degree of the energy loss may also depend on the pseudorapidity region in which a jet is produced because the energy loss is proportional to the particle density in pseudorapidity .",
    "the pseudorapidity dependence of high @xmath6 hadron production provides a means to probe the initial density of matter along both the transverse and longitudinal directions .    in this article",

    "measurements presented in this article are based on two data sets of au + au collisions at @xmath0 gev , which were recorded by the star detector at rhic .",
    "a detailed description of the star detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the two data sets comprise minimum bias and central collision triggered events which correspond to approximately the most central 10% of the au + au geometric cross section . charged particle tracks of an event were detected in the time projection chamber  @xcite ( tpc ) with a pseudorapidity coverage @xmath22 and complete azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the transverse momentum of a track is determined by fitting a circle through the transverse coordinates of the primary event vertex and the space points along the track in the tpc .",
    "the total momentum can be calculated using this radius of curvature in a 0.25 t magnetic field and the polar angle of the track .",
    "the procedure involves a three dimensional fit using three coordinates of the primary vertex determined from all of the tracks reconstructed in the tpc .",
    "the primary vertex position along the beam direction , @xmath23 , has a wide spread with one standard deviation about 100 cm . to increase detection efficiency of the tracks within @xmath24",
    ", we required the events to have a primary vertex @xmath25 cm .",
    "after the event selection cuts , the minimum bias data set contained @xmath26 181k events and the central data set contained @xmath26 365k events .",
    "centrality selection is based on the uncorrected primary charged particle multiplicity @xmath27 within @xmath28 and @xmath29 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the requirement on @xmath20 range maximizes the number of tracks used to define centrality in an event while keeping the tracking acceptance approximately constant .",
    "the percentage of the geometric cross section is determined in the same way as that published by star previously  @xcite , where the negatively charged hadron multiplicity @xmath30 distribution within @xmath5 was used .",
    "the data set is divided into seven centrality bins , and the most central bin is 05% ( the top 5% of the multiplicity distribution ) while the most peripheral bin is 6080% .",
    "the analysis in this article covers a transverse momentum region of @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "accepted primary tracks have @xmath24 , at least 25 space points in the tpc used in the track fit out of 45 pad rows , a fit probability of being a primary track greater than 0.05 , and a distance of closest approach to the primary vertex less than 1 cm .",
    "these track quality cuts were varied to estimate the systematic uncertainty .",
    "acceptance and efficiency were determined by embedding simulated tracks into actual au + au collision events .",
    "the measured high @xmath6 hadron yield is sensitive to small spatial distortions of the tpc alignments in both azimuthal and longitudinal directions .",
    "a measurement of the summed hadron yield , @xmath31 , is less sensitive to such distortions than the yield of one charge sign alone .",
    "using 12 sectors from each of the tpc ends as independent detectors for high @xmath6 hadrons , we estimated the sectorwise ( azimuthal direction ) variations of the yields to be less than 5% .",
    "the variation of the yield between the hadrons crossing and not crossing the central membrane of the tpc was found to be approximately proportional to @xmath6 with a value of 11% at @xmath32 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the typical correction factors for the acceptance and efficiency are given in table  [ tab : errors ] as `` tracking '' .",
    "the systematic uncertainties incorporate acceptance , efficiency , track quality cuts , and the effects of the spatial nonuniformity .",
    "the tracking and other correction factors and their systematic uncertainties given in table  [ tab : errors ] for @xmath5 differ from those given in our previous paper  @xcite because different track quality cuts and other correction procedures were used .",
    "finite momentum resolution tends to spread particles to neighboring bins in a momentum histogram , especially for an exponentially falling spectrum .",
    "this smearing effect can not be neglected at higher @xmath6 where the momentum resolution is limited by the strength of the magnetic field and the tpc spatial resolution .",
    "we used the embedding technique to determine the @xmath6 resolution . for @xmath33 gev/@xmath2 within @xmath5 the gaussian distribution of track curvature",
    "@xmath34 has a relative width of @xmath35(gev/@xmath2 ) for central events and @xmath36(gev/@xmath2 ) for peripheral events . within @xmath4 , @xmath37(gev/@xmath2 ) for central events and",
    "@xmath38(gev/@xmath2 ) for peripheral events .",
    "the fact that the @xmath6 resolution for @xmath4 is better than that for @xmath5 is due to the competition between two opposing effects . for a given @xmath6 track in the tpc",
    ", the hadron with higher @xmath20 tends to have fewer space points , hence poorer resolution , but shorter drift distance , hence better resolution .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath6 resolution determined from the embedding technique did not include the effect of the primary vertex resolution .",
    "the effects of the @xmath6 smearing due to the primary vertex resolution , to the charge - sign - dependent distortion , and to the weak decay background tracks , have been empirically derived from the comparison between real and embedded tracks .",
    "the combined effect within @xmath4 was found to be larger than that within @xmath5 .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that the magnitude of the charge - sign - dependent distortion in the higher @xmath20 region is larger .",
    "the two contributions have been convoluted into a power law function to fit the data , and then the ratio of the fitted function to its convoluted one gives the @xmath6 smearing correction factor  @xcite . because the two contributions have opposite @xmath39 dependence , the overall @xmath6 smearing correction factors for the two @xmath20 regions happen to be comparable .",
    "the typical @xmath6 smearing correction factors and their systematic uncertainties are also given in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "the most significant backgrounds for the high @xmath6 charged hadron yield as seen in table  [ tab : errors ] come from particle weak decays and antinucleon annihilation in detector material .",
    "the contamination rate for each background source was estimated using detector response simulations with events generated by the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath6 dependence of production of weakly decaying particles , primarily @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and of antinucleons , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , in hijing is not consistent with experimental measurements .",
