    "the background for this analysis is the generally known phenomenon of _ anderson localization _ : the addition of extensive disorder to a linear operator results in the localization of the eigenfunctions corresponding to certain spectral regimes , where the spectral type changes to _ pure - point_. the localization regime may cover the full spectral range  as is typically the case in one dimension even at arbitrarily small , but non - zero strength of the disorder @xcite . a major challenge for analysts is to shed light on extended states and ac spectrum .",
