    "<S> it often leads to new intricate physics and rich phases diagrams already when the magnetic moments behave classically . </S>",
    "<S> electron systems interacting with nuclear spins through the hyperfine interaction or magnetic adatoms with large magnetic moments arranged in some array on a metallic surface enter into this class .    in 1d , </S>",
    "<S> the interactions between the nuclear spins and electrons lead to dramatic effects : below a cross - over temperature @xmath0 , a new exotic phase of matter in which the nuclear magnets are strongly tied to the electrons naturally emerges @xcite . in this phase , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spins form a helical magnetic structure caused by the effective ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction @xcite mediated by the electron system . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback of this nuclear overhauser field on the electron system entirely restructures the electronic states in that it opens a gap in one half of the elementary low - energy modes . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining electronic degrees of freedom remain gapless and form a quasi helical luttinger liquid with strong analogies @xcite with the edge states of the 2d quantum spin hall effect @xcite . due to the mutual feedback </S>",
    "<S> this order of strongly coupled electrons and nuclear spins is stable below a temperature @xmath0 , and electron - electron interactions substantially enhance the stability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent transport measurements in cleaved edge overgrowth gaas quantum wires found a reduction of the conductance by a factor of two below @xmath1 independently of the density or applied magnetic field , consistent with this theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the mechanism behind this emergent helical structure is general , the essential ingredient being the rkky interaction . </S>",

    "<S> when a finite - sized helical liquid is put in proximity of a s - wave superconductor , majorana states can emerge at both ends @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : system ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case for a quantum wire in presence of spin - orbit coupling and a zeeman term @xcite where some possible signatures of majorana fermion physics have been recently reported experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the helical liquid , up to a gauge transformation @xcite , can also be obtained by coupling electrons to a spiral magnetic field ( like the intrinsic nuclear overhauser field @xcite ) , or by manufacturing an external rotating magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can appear in rare - earth compounds exhibiting coexisting helical magnetism and superconductivity @xcite , or emerge by arranging magnetic adatoms in 1d arrays on the surface of a superconductor @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since induced or intrinsic superconductivity entirely restructures the electron system , it is not a priori obvious whether the helical entangled states remain stable . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we provide such an investigation , carefully taking also into account electron - electron interactions and disorder . </S>",
    "<S> ps . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying physics is the following : the rkky interaction between the local moments has a strong @xmath2 component ( with @xmath3 the fermi wave vector ) , such that the local moments tend to be opposite at length @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the rkky energy can thus be minimized if the local moments form a spiral @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this spiral acts back on the electron as the effective spiral zeeman field required , together with the induced superconductivity , to drive the system into the topological superconductivity phase . yet </S>",
    "<S> the opening of the superconducting gap as well as renormalizations by interactions and disorder modify again the rkky interaction . taking this self - consistently into account , however , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a self - stabilizing topological phase supporting majorana bound states naturally emerges . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this topological phase requires no fine - tuning . </S>",

    "<S> the second term describes the coupling between the electron spins @xmath8 and the magnetic moments @xmath9 , weighted by a coupling constant @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the magnetic moments @xmath11 lie on a 1d chain . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the distances between neighboring moments fulfill @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> yet it is not required that the @xmath11 lie on a regular 1d lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath8 are a tight binding representation of the electron spin operator in a region of dimension @xmath13 centered about @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath9 are either very large spins @xmath14 or composites of a large number @xmath15 of individual magnetic moments @xmath14 locked to a parallel configuration in some small volume at @xmath11 ( such as nuclear spins in the transverse section of a quantum wire @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former case is treated with @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath9 is normalized with respect to @xmath15 such that @xmath10 represents the interaction constant between an electron and one of the @xmath15 individual moments @xmath14 of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> ps . it has been shown numerically in @xcite and further justified in @xcite that this simple model captures qualitatively the behavior of a regular array of magnetic adatoms adsorbed on a superconducting surface ( see also @xcite for the 2d case ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic coupling @xmath10 also provides an effective rkky @xcite interaction and dynamics for the magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is carried over the response of the electron system to magnetic perturbations and consists in an almost instantaneous long - ranged heisenberg interaction between the magnetic moments @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electron spin susceptibility and @xmath19 the lattice spacing between the moments @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> note that generally @xmath20 can be anisotropic .    to analyze the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we resort to a born - oppenheimer decoupling as in @xcite which relies on the fact that the magnetic moments have a much slower dynamics than the electrons . since the large moments @xmath9 allow a ( quasi)classical description , the terms @xmath21 act like a local quasi - static zeeman field @xmath22 on the electron spins @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective theory is , therefore , expressed by the pair of hamiltonians @xcite @xmath23 while @xmath24 acts only on electrons and @xmath25 only on the magnetic moments , we stress that both hamiltonians are strongly coupled since @xmath26 depends on the state of the magnetic moment system , and @xmath20 on the electron state . </S>",

    "<S> _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have shown that in 1d a strong entanglement between magnetic moments and the electrons leads naturally at low temperature to a magnetic spiral structure . </S>",
    "<S> combined with a proximity induced superconducting gap , this structure can drive the system into a topological superconducting phase supporting majorana fermions . </S>",
    "<S> a fine - tuning of external parameters is not required . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario applies to semiconducting wires with nuclear spins or to a chain of magnetic adatoms on top of a superconductor surface . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrated that moderate electron interactions help stabilizing the topological phase .    </S>",
