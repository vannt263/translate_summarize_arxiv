    "more than 40 years ago , a quasidegeneracy was observed in heavy nuclei between two single - particle states with the quantum numbers ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath1 ) . in analogy with the well known spin - symmetry ( ss ) breaking for the spin doublets ( @xmath2 ) , which is one of the most important concepts for understanding the traditional magic number in atomic nuclei  @xcite , the pseudospin symmetry ( pss )",
    "was proposed by defining the pseudospin doublets ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the pss concept has explained numerous phenomena in nuclear structure including deformation @xcite , superdeformation @xcite , identical bands @xcite , and magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "especially for the magic number change in exotic nuclei , the spin and pseudospin symmetries are pointed out to play important roles . for instance , the @xmath6 shell closure disappears due to the quenching of the spin - orbit splitting for the @xmath7 spin doublets @xcite , and the @xmath8 sub - shell closure is closely related to the restoration of pss for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 pseudospin doublets nagai81,long07,long09 . because of these successes , there have been comprehensive efforts to understand the origin of this symmetry as well as its breaking mechanism . based on the single - particle hamiltonian of the oscillator shell model , bahri et al . indicated that the origin of pss is connected with a special ratio in the strength of the spin - orbit and orbit - orbit interactions , and the ratio can be partly explained by the relativistic mean field theory @xcite .",
    "blokhin et al .",
    "introduced a helicity unitary transformation which can map a normal state ( @xmath11 ) to a pseudo state ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "a substantial progress was achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the relativistic feature of pss was recognized .",
    "the pseudo - orbital angular momentum @xmath13 is nothing but the orbital angular momentum of the lower component of the dirac spinor , and the equality in magnitude but difference in sign of the scalar potential @xmath14 and vector potential @xmath15 was suggested as the exact pss limit . in a more general condition ,",
    "the exact pss is satisfied in the dirac equation when the sum of the scalar @xmath14 and vector @xmath15 potentials is equal to a constant @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pss in real nuclei was shown in connection with the competition between the pseudocentrifugal barrier and the pseudospin - orbital potential @xcite . even with these excellent work mentioned above",
    ", there is still much attention on the cause of splitting for the reason that the exact pss can not be met in real nuclei . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the observed pseudospin splitting arises from a cancelation of the several energy components , and the pss in nuclei has a dynamical character .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in refs .",
    "in addition , it was noted that , unlike the spin symmetry , the pseudospin breaking can not be treated as a perturbation of the pseudospin - symmetric hamiltonianliang11 .",
    "the nonperturbation nature of pss has also been mentioned in ref . @xcite .",
    "further , the supersymmetric description of pss was presented for the spherical nuclei and axially deformed nuclei leviatan04,typel08,leviatan09 . in a very recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics and similarity renormalization group ( srg ) are used as the critical tools for understanding the origin of pss and its breaking mechanism , and the cause why the pss becomes better for the levels closer to the continuum is discussed in a quantitative way at the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this symmetry is also checked in the resonant states  @xcite with similar features to bound states indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    regardless of these pioneering studies",
    ", the origin of pss has not been fully understood in the relativistic framework .",
    "recently , we have examined the pss by use of the similarity renormalization group and shown explicitly the relativistic origin of this symmetry @xcite . we have also studied the relativistic effect of this symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , we have not researched the dependence of pss on the shape of the potential and the quantum numbers of the states by using this hamiltonian . although the correlation of the energy splitting of pseudospin partners with the nuclear potential parameters has been investigated by solving the dirac equation with woods - saxon scalar and vector radial potentials @xcite",
    ", we do not know the relationship between the splitting of every component and the shape of the potential , which is particularly important to reveal the origin of pss . in this paper",
    ", we explore the dependence of the pss on the shape of the potential and the quantum numbers of the states by using this hamiltonian obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to disclose the influence of every component , especially those relating the dynamical effect and the spin - orbit interactions .",
    "for simplicity , we sketch our formalism with the following dirac hamiltonian : @xmath16where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the combinations of the scalar potential @xmath19 and the vector potential @xmath20 and @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 . to extract the different components from @xmath23 , the srg is used to transform the dirac hamiltonian into a block - diagonal form .",
    "the details can be referred to the literature @xcite .",
    "the diagonal dirac hamiltonian is written as@xmath24where @xmath25is an operator describing dirac particle with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the charge - conjugation of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the charge - conjugation operator is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the complex conjugation operator  @xcite .",
    "the primes and the double primes in @xmath28 respectively denote first- and second - order derivatives with respect to @xmath31 . from eq.([diracp ] ) , we see that the present transformation avoids all the drawbacks in the usual decoupling  @xcite , and @xmath28 holds the form of schrdinger - like operator .",
    "with the formalism represented in the previous section , we explore the origin of pss by use of @xmath28 . to convince the reliability of the present calculations , we first check the convergence of the expansion in eq .",
    "( diracp ) . for convenience in the numerical computations ,",
    "a woods - saxon type potential is adopted for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36which is realistic enough to be applied to nuclei although it is not a full self - consistent relativistic potential derived from meson fields alber02 . using this potential for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , there are six parameters , i.e. , the central depths , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , two radii , and two diffuseness parameters . following refs .",
    "@xcite , the same radius @xmath39 and surface diffuseness @xmath40 are set for the both potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath37 , @xmath41 , @xmath40 , and @xmath39 are determined by fitting the neutron spectra of @xmath42pb with the fitted results : @xmath43 mev , @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 fm , and @xmath46 fm . with the values for the parameters , the energy spectra of @xmath28 are obtained and listed in table i in comparisons with the solutions of the original dirac equation . from table",
    "i , it can be seen that the deviations between the nonrelativistic limit ( the second column ) and the exact relativistic case ( the fifth column ) are very large , i.e. , the relativistic effect is apparent in the present system . with the increasing perturbation order ,",
    "the calculated result is closer to the exact relativistic one .",
    "when @xmath28 is approximated to the order @xmath47 , the calculated spectra are considerably agreeable with those from the exact relativistic calculations . these indicate that the convergence of the present expansion is satisfactory , and it is reasonable enough to probe the pss hidden in dirac hamiltonian in terms of the operator @xmath28 .",

    "hence , it is easy to calculate the contribution of each component to the pseudospin splitting , which is helpful to disclose the origin of pss .",
    "the contribution of @xmath65 to the level @xmath66 is calculated by the formula @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a eigenvector of the @xmath69-state .    to clarify whether the quality of pss originates mainly from the competition of the dynamical effect and the spin - orbit interactions",

    "is depicted in fig.3 .",
    "similar to the previous two figures , the pss is improved by the spin - orbit interactions for all the pseudospin partners considered here .",

    "different from the spin - orbit interactions , the dynamical term destroys pss for the deeply bound states @xmath79 , @xmath83 , @xmath71 , and @xmath84 , while improves pss for the loosely bound states @xmath72 and @xmath82 . the contributions of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 to the pseudospin splitting are negligible .    the pseudospin energy splitting varying with the depth of potential is exhibited in figs.7 - 9 for these partners shown in figs.4 - 6 .",
    "the potential depth @xmath37 almost does not affect the splitting contributed by the nonrelativistic part regardless of the splitting is serious .",
    "the evolution of pseudospin energy splitting with @xmath37 is mostly dominated by the spin - orbit interactions and the dynamical effect . over the range of @xmath85 here ,",
