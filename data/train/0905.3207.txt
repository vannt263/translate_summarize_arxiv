    "experimental realization of the atomic mixtures and progress in manipulating cold atom systems have opened exciting new possibilities to study many - body physics of low - dimensional quantum gases beyond the mean - field theory . in comparison with the single - component systems , mixtures of quantum degenerate atoms",
    "may form novel quantum many - body systems with richer phase structures .",
    "particularly , two - component bose gases have been under intensive studies both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . due to the competition among the inter - species and intra - species interactions ,",
    "many interesting phenomena such as phase separation , new quantum states and phase transitions arise in two - component cold atomic gases @xcite . with strong anisotropic magnetic trap or two - dimensional optical lattice",
    "the radial degrees of freedom of cold atoms are frozen and the quantum gas is described by an effective one - dimensional ( 1d ) model @xcite . as a textbook example the 1d tonks - girardeau (",
    "tg ) gas @xcite was observed firstly @xcite . since then",
    ", not only the single - component bosonic gas but also 1d multi - component atomic mixtures have become the current research focus . in principle , both the intra - component and inter - component interactions can be tuned via the magnetic feshbach resonance , which allows us to study the bosonic mixture in the whole interaction regime .",
    "very recently , two - species bose gases with tunable interaction have been successfully produced @xcite .",
    "in general , 1d quantum systems exhibit fascinating physics significantly different from its three - dimensional counterpart because of the enhanced quantum fluctuations in 1d @xcite .",
    "the mean - field theory generally works not well for the 1d systems except in very weakly interacting regime .",
    "when interaction is strong enough , non - perturbation methods , for instance , bose - fermi mapping ( bfm ) , bethe ansatz and bosonization method , have to be exerted to properly characterize the features of the system @xcite .",
    "for a single - component bose gas , it has been shown that the density profiles continuously evolve from gaussian - like distribution of bosons to shell - structured distribution of fermions @xcite with the increase in repulsion strength .",
    "similar behavior of composite fermionization has been observed in the 1d bose - bose mixtures @xcite . for two - component bose mixture with spin - independent repulsions ,",
    "the normalized density distribution of each component displays the same behavior up to a normalized constant which is proportional to respective atomic number of each component @xcite .",
    "while the extended bose - fermi mappings @xcite are restricted to the infinitely repulsive limit , some sophisticate methods , such as multi - configuration self - consistent hartree method @xcite , numerical diagonalization method @xcite , and bethe ansatz method @xcite , have been applied to study the two - component bose gases in the whole repulsive regime . nevertheless , the above methods either suffer the small - size restriction @xcite or only limit to the integrable models @xcite which generally do not cover the realistic system confined in an external harmonic trap .    in this work",
    ", we use the basic idea of density functional theory ( dft ) to investigate the ground - state properties of the two - component bose gases trapped in harmonic potential in the full interacting regime .",
    "it is well known that the dft can handle the system with large sizes and will not encounter the exponential wall that the above traditional multiparticle wave - function methods faced .",
    "the effects of the external potential will be accounted by using the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "the combination of dft and lda had been applied to deal with the confined 1d single - component bose gas @xcite and fermi gas @xcite successfully .",
    "however , the two - component bose gas has rarely been studied .",
    "the present work will study the ground - state properties of the confined bose mixture and focus on two cases where the ground state energy function for the homogeneous system can be obtained exactly . in the first case , we consider the two - component bose gas with spin - independent interaction . in the absence of external potential ,",
    "this model is exactly solvable by the bethe - ansatz method and thus the ground - state energy density function can be extracted from the bethe - ansatz solution @xcite . in the second case",
    ", we consider the two - component bose gas with infinitely repulsive intra - component interactions and a tunable inter - component interaction .",
    "we will show that such a model can be mapped into the yang - gaudin model with generalized bose - fermi transformation and thus the ground - state energy function can be obtained from the bethe - ansatz solution of the yang - gaudin model @xcite . in the scheme of dft ,",
    "the ground - state density profiles are obtained by numerically solving the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nles ) for both the equal - mixing bose mixture and polarized bose mixture .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii investigates two - component bose gas with spin - independent interaction and introduce the method .",
