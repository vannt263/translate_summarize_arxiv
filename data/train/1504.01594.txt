    "in the quest to understand when galaxies formed their stars and assembled their mass , two complementary observational techniques can be employed : direct observations of galaxies at different redshifts , and reconstruction of the previous galaxy history from fossil records at a given epoch .",
    "the main advantage of the first method is that measuring the current star formation is less uncertain than estimating the past history , especially in galaxies in which the light of young stars outshines the older population , in particular at high redshift ( papovich et al .",
    "2001 ; zibetti et al . 2009 ; conroy 2013 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the second method has the benefit of tracing the evolution of each individual galaxy , without having to infer histories in a statistical sense with the problems involved in the identification of progenitors and descendants .",
    "both methods heavily rely on spectrophotometric modeling , to calibrate the star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators and derive the star formation histories ( sfhs ) , and are affected by the choice of the initial mass function ( imf ) .    on a cosmic scale ,",
    "the collection of the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) measurements at different cosmic times ( from z=8 to 0 ) give us an indication on the summa of the sfh of the universe .",

    "the sfrd(z ) has important implications for the reionization of the universe , the cosmic chemical evolution , the transformation of gas into stars and the build - up of stellar mass .",
    "ideally , however , one would want to go beyond the description of cosmic global history , and trace galaxy evolution on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis to understand the physical processes driving it . in this respect ,",
    "great progress has been made by surveys at different redshifts that have established the existence of a strong dependence of galaxy histories on galaxy stellar mass .",

    "even galaxies of the same mass are characterised by different timescales and sfhs depending on their environment .",
    "the average decline of the star formation process in galaxies of a given mass is less steep in the field than in clusters .",
    "cluster galaxies form the bulk of their stars at earlier epochs with average high - z sfrd values per galaxy systematically higher than those of the field at any given galaxy stellar mass today , as we will see in more details in the next section .",
    "the last sequence of plots in figure [ massm123 ] aims to answer the following questions : on average , do galaxies of different morphological types but same masses have different histories ? do galaxies of the same mass and morphological type have different histories depending on the environment ?    we divide galaxies according to their morphological type , mass bin and environment . to avoid any possible residual mass dependence in each mass bin , we first verified whether galaxies in each given mass bin and given morphological type had the same mass distribution in both environments , performing a kolmogorov smirnov test ( ks ) .",

    "figure  [ massm123 ] highlights that , perhaps surprisingly , in a given environment , galaxies of the same mass but different morphologies share the same history of star formation , except for the lowest redshift bin .",
    "in fact , the average sfr of late - type , s0 and elliptical galaxies of a given mass is similar within the errors at all redshifts , except at @xmath56 when late - type galaxies have a systematically higher value than early - type galaxies .",
    "there is , instead , a different sfh in clusters and field for galaxies of a given mass and morphological type : all types in clusters have a higher sfr at @xmath1 and a lower sfr at lower redshifts , than field galaxies .",
    "comparing now the different mass bins , the downsizing in star formation is again visible ( the slope of the sfh gets steeper at higher masses ) .",
    "the range of sfr at the lowest redshift is similar for galaxies of all masses , while it varies greatly at the highest z ( see sect . [ subsec_morphomass_plots ] ) .    from the analysis of these plots ,",
    "it is possible to establish a general hierarchy in the properties of galaxies which mostly influence the star formation process .",
    "galaxy mass is clearly an important factor in determining the sfr slope with time , in all environments .",
    "however , it is not the only factor , as cluster galaxies of a given mass have a steeper decline of sf with time . for each mass , the highest average sfr at @xmath1",
    "is found for cluster galaxies , and does not depend on morphology .",
    "morphology , in contrast , has little influence on the sfh .",
    "the only morphological dependence is at the present epoch when , on average , a late - type galaxy forms more stars than an early - type galaxy of the same mass .",
    "these results seem to suggest that the stellar history of a galaxy depends mainly on its mass _ and _ environment , and is almost independent of its present - day morphology . finally , computing from fig .",
    "[ massm123 ] the ratio of the average sfr in the highest and lowest redshift bins for galaxies of the same mass and morphology and comparing it for different environments , we obtain cluster - to - field ratios typically ranging from 4 to 7 , with an average of 5 .",
    "thus , the much steeper sfrd decline in clusters compared to the field ( ratio=40/7=5.7 ) discussed in [ subsec_environ_plots ] can be explained by the steeper history of cluster galaxies compared to the field , at fixed galaxy mass and morphology .",
    "we conclude that the different slope in the sfrd(z ) of clusters and field is not driven by variations of the galaxy mass or morphological distributions with environment , but by the fact that galaxy stellar histories vary with galaxy location at each given mass and morphology .",
    "having derived the sfh of galaxies in clusters ( wings ) and the field ( pm2gc ) , we have investigated the sfrd evolution with redshift as a function of environment , the histories of galaxies that are still forming stars at the time they are observed , and the role of galaxy masses , morphologies and environment in driving the differences of the sfrd(z ) with environment .",
    "we have found that :    1 .",
    "the pm2gc cumulative sfrd agrees quite well with the sfrd observed at different redshifts ( figure [ pm2gc_md14 ] ) .",
    "the only discrepancy is seen at the highest z ( z @xmath57 2 ) where the pm2gc sfrd is a factor @xmath58 lower than the integral of the md14 best - fit function over the same redshift interval .",
    "the sfrd changes with environment ( figure [ pm2wings_subsets ] ) and in particular two effects contribute simultaneously to the cluster - field differences in the sfrd : the different density of the two environments , which changes the normalization of the sfrds at all epochs , and the intrinsic differences of the histories within the environments , which change the slope of the sfrd .",
    "the cluster sfrd decline is much steeper than in the field , and there is a progressive steepening going from single to binaries to groups and clusters , as well as going from lower mass to higher mass haloes .",
    "the decline of the sfrd(z ) is due to two factors : the decline of the sfh of star forming galaxies and the quenching rate of galaxies as a function of redshift ( figure [ sfingmass ] ) .",
    "we have quantified the relative importance of the two processes ( figure [ interpolazione ] ) : the star formation process at high z was mainly due to galaxies which today are not active anymore , and this is true in particular for clusters .",
    "more than 50 % of the sfr in the field and more than 75 % in clusters at z @xmath57 2 originated in galaxies that are not currently forming stars . at z @xmath11 1 these factors are 42 % in the field and 73 % in clusters .",
    "galaxies of different morphological types but same mass and environment have on average remarkably similar sfrs at all epochs except at the lowest redshift , suggesting that the current morphological type is linked with the current morphology but is largely non - influent for the past sfh .",
    "the average sfh of a galaxy depends on galaxy stellar mass and , at fixed mass , on galaxy environment .",
    "the different slope of the decline in the sfrd(z ) in clusters and field is due to the fact that galaxies of given mass and morphology form their stars sooner in clusters than in the field .",
    "these results point to an accelerated formation in high mass haloes compared to low mass ones even for galaxies that will end up having the same galaxy mass today .",
