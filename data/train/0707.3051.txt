    "khovanov  @xcite introduced a bigraded cohomology theory for oriented links , now known as khovanov homology , which takes values in bigraded @xmath5-modules and is a categorification of the unnormalized jones polynomial .",
    "it is based on a @xmath6-dimensional tqft associated to a frobenius algebra and is related to the lie algebra @xmath1 . since its introduction in 1999 , khovanov homology has proved to be a powerful invariant for classical links .",
    "for example , bar - natan  @xcite found that it is a stronger invariant than the jones polynomial .",
    "moreover , rasmussen  @xcite gave a combinatorial proof of the milnor conjecture by using a variant of khovanov s theory introduced by lee  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , khovanov classified all possible frobenius systems of rank two ( for a definition of a frobenius system see  @xcite and  @xcite ) which give rise to link homologies , and this one corresponds to @xmath7/(x^2)$ ] .",
    "bar - natan  @xcite extended this theory to tangles by using a setup with cobordisms modulo relations , which in particular leads to an improvement in computational efficiency .",
    "he shows how khovanov s construction can be used to define a functor from the category of links , with link cobordisms modulo ambient isotopy as morphisms , to the homotopy category of complexes over ( 1 + 1)-cobordisms modulo a finite set of relations .",
    "bar - natan  @xcite , jacobsson  @xcite and khovanov  @xcite independently found that khovanov homology is functorial for link cobordisms , in the sense that given a link cobordism @xmath8 $ ] between links @xmath9 and @xmath10 , there is an induced map between their khovanov homologies @xmath11 and @xmath12 , well - defined up to an overall minus sign , under ambient isotopy of @xmath13 relative to @xmath14 .    in  @xcite , khovanov showed how to construct a link homology theory whose graded euler characteristic is the quantum @xmath2 link invariant . instead of @xmath6-dimensional cobordisms",
    ", he uses webs and foams modulo a finite set of relations .",
    "mackaay and vaz  @xcite defined the universal @xmath2 link homology , which depends on @xmath15 parameters , following khovanov s approach with foams .",
    "their theory arises from a frobenius algebra structure defined on @xmath16/(x^3-ax^2-bx - c)$ ] .    in this paper",
    "we construct a bigraded @xmath1 cohomology theory for oriented tangles ( thus , in particular , it applies to oriented knots and links ) over @xmath17[a]$ ] , where @xmath0 is a formal variable and @xmath18 is the primitive fourth root of unity ; that is , @xmath17[a ] = \\mathbb{z}[i , a]$ ] is the polynomial ring in the variable @xmath0 over the gaussian integers @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we remark that our theory corresponds to the frobenius system given by @xmath17[x , a]/(x^2-a)$ ] .",
    "the construction starts from the oriented state model for the jones polynomial  @xcite , or similarly , from an approach to the quantum @xmath1 link invariant via a calculus of planar bivalent graphs , called _",
    "webs are evaluated recursively by the rules defined in figure  [ fig : web skein relations ] .",
    "each transformation either reduces the number of vertices or removes an oriented loop or the simplest closed web with bivalent vertices of figure  [ fig : circle2sv ] .",
    "in particular , a closed web evaluates to a polynomial in @xmath19 with positive integer coefficients .    to compute the quantum @xmath1 invariant of an oriented link @xmath20 , @xmath21 , choose its plane projection @xmath22 and resolve each crossing in two possible ways , as in figure  [ fig : resolutions ] .",
    "a diagram @xmath22 with @xmath23 crossings admits @xmath24 resolutions , and each of the resulting resolution is a collection of disjoint closed webs ( piecewise oriented closed curves ) that evaluates to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of connected components of that resolution .",
    "the invariant of @xmath20 is the sum of these webs evaluations weighted by powers of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as explained in figure  [ fig : decomposition of crossings ] . after normalization and a simple change of variable",
    "we obtain the jones polynomial of the link @xmath20 .",
    "the principal constant in our construction is @xmath29 , the expression associated to each closed web , independent of the ( even ) number of vertices that it contains .",
    "we work in a more general case , by considering tangle diagrams , and the construction follows closely the approach of khovanov homology theory for tangles introduced in  @xcite . given all resolutions of a tangle @xmath30 , we form in a specific way an @xmath23-dimensional cube of all resolutions of @xmath30 , and from this one a formal complex @xmath31 $ ] with objects column vectors of webs and differentials matrices of _ foams _ , where a foam is an abstract cobordism between two webs . by considering foams",
    "modulo a finite set of local relations , @xmath31 $ ] is invariant under reidemeister moves .",
    "we pass from the topological picture to an algebraic one , by applying a specific functor @xmath32 from the category of foams modulo local relations to the category of @xmath17[a]$]-modules and module homomorphisms , that extends to the category of formal complexes over matrices of foams modulo local relations .",
    "the above categories are graded and the functor @xmath32 is degree - preserving . in this approach , @xmath29 becomes a certain free @xmath17[a]$]-module @xmath33 of rank two with generators in degrees @xmath34 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is the object ( ` homology ' ) we associate to any closed web and oriented loop .",
    "the ` homology ' of the empty web is the ground ring @xmath17[a]$ ] .",
    "@xmath35)$ ] is now an ordinary complex and applying @xmath32 to all homotopies we have that @xmath35)$ ] is an invariant of the tangle diagram @xmath30 , up to homotopy .",
    "thus the isomorphism class of the homology @xmath36))$ ] is a bigraded invariant of @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , if the tangle is a link @xmath20 , one can easily conclude from our construction that the graded euler characteristic of @xmath37)$ ] is the quantum @xmath1 polynomial of @xmath20 .",

    ", we expect our theory to be functorial under link cobordisms .",
    "indeed , given a @xmath40-dimensional cobordism @xmath41 between links @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we construct a well - defined map @xmath42 \\rightarrow [ l_2]$ ] between the associated formal complexes . in showing that the associated map is well defined there are two parts",
    ". first we show that it is well - defined up to multiplication by a unit , following bar - natan s method in  @xcite , and then we check each movie move , using in some cases the idea of looking at a `` homotopically isolated object '' , borrowed from  @xcite , to show that actually no unit appears , besides @xmath34 .",
    "note that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both the empty links , then a cobordism between them is a @xmath43-knot in @xmath44 ( see  @xcite ) , and the map @xmath42 \\rightarrow [ l_2]$ ] becomes a group homomorphism @xmath17[a ] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{z}[i][a]$ ] , hence an element of the ground ring .",
    "therefore , this yields an invariant of @xmath43-knots .    adding the relation @xmath45",
    ", we obtain a cohomology theory that is isomorphic to a version of khovanov s @xmath1 ( co)homology theory .",
    "specifically , for each link @xmath20 there is an isomorphism @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the mirror image of @xmath20 , and @xmath48 is the homology theory defined in  @xcite . as our theory is properly functorial under link cobordisms , it naturally resolves the sign indeterminancy in functoriality of khovanov s invariant .",
    "we should point out that both the construction and result for @xmath45 are very close to those in  @xcite , and that the two pieces of work were done independently .",
    "however , as we mentioned above , we remark that we borrowed from  @xcite the excellent idea of working with `` homotopically isolated objects '' when checking the functoriality property of our invariant , which makes all the calculations much easier .",
    "we remark that one can generalize the construction presented in this paper by working with a frobenius algebra structure defined on @xmath17[x , h , a]/(x^2 -hx -a)$ ] , where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding ( co)homology theory is properly functorial under link cobordisms and is the geometric description of the homology theory that corresponds to the universal rank two frobenius system defined in  @xcite ( after being tensored with @xmath17 $ ] ) . adding the relation @xmath51 , the present construction is recovered",

    "[ relations l ] we introduce a set of local relations @xmath57 in the category _ foams _ , and show they are consistent and uniquely determine the evaluation of every closed foam ( a dotted , seamed cobordism from the empty web to itself ) .",
    "then we consider the quotient category @xmath58 and show that @xmath54 descends to a functor @xmath59[a]$]-mod ; the empty set here means that the considered webs are closed webs , thus have empty boundary . by defining a grading of a foam , we make both categories _ foams _ and @xmath58 graded .",
    "we also prove a set of relations in @xmath58 that will play a significant role in our construction . as a consequence ,",
