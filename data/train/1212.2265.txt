    "when the particle systems have the characteristic momenta which are of the same order or even much larger than the masses of the particles involved , it is part of nature that a relativistic treatment is called for in order to describe those systems properly .",
    "in particular , relativistic effects are most essential to describe the low - lying hadron systems in terms of strongly interacting quarks / antiquarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . for the study of relativistic particle systems ,",
    "dirac proposed the three different forms of the relativistic hamiltonian dynamics in 1949 @xcite : i.e. the instant ( @xmath2 ) , front ( @xmath3 ) , and point ( @xmath4 ) forms . while the instant form dynamics ( ifd ) of quantum field theories is based on the usual equal time @xmath5 quantization ( @xmath6 unit is taken here ) , the equal light - front time @xmath7 quantization yields the front form dynamics , more commonly called light - front dynamics ( lfd ) , correspondingly .",
    "although the point form dynamics has also been explored @xcite , the most popular choices were thus far the equal-@xmath0 ( instant form ) and equal-@xmath8 ( front form ) quantizations .    a crucial difference between the instant form and the front form may be attributed to their energy - momentum dispersion relations .",
    "when a particle has the mass @xmath9 and the four - momentum @xmath10 , the relativistic energy - momentum dispersion relation of the particle at equal-@xmath0 is given by @xmath11 where the energy @xmath12 is conjugate to @xmath0 and the three - momentum vector @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "however , the corresponding energy - momentum dispersion relation at equal-@xmath8 is given by @xmath15 where the light - front energy @xmath16 conjugate to @xmath8 is given by @xmath17 and the light - front momenta @xmath18 and @xmath19 are orthogonal to @xmath16 . while the instant form ( eq.([eq.01 ] ) ) exhibits an irrational energy - momentum relation , the front form ( eq.([eq.02 ] ) )",
    "yields a rational relation and thus the signs of @xmath20 and @xmath16 are correlated , e.g. the momentum @xmath20 is always positive when the system evolve to the future direction ( i.e. positive @xmath8 ) so that the light - front energy @xmath16 is positive . in the instant form ,",
    "however , no sign correlations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 exist .",
    "such a difference in the energy - momentum dispersion relation makes the lfd quite distinct from other forms of the relativistic hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the light - front quantization @xcite has already been applied successfully in the context of current algebra @xcite and the parton model @xcite in the past . with further advances in the hamiltonian renormalization program @xcite",
    ", lfd appears to be even more promising for the relativistic treatment of hadrons . in the work of brodsky , hiller and mccartor @xcite ,",
    "it is demonstrated how to solve the problem of renormalizing light - front hamiltonian theories while maintaining lorentz symmetry and other symmetries .",
    "the genesis of the work presented in @xcite may be found in @xcite and additional examples including the use of lfd methods to solve the bound - state problems in field theory can be found in the review of qcd and other field theories on the light cone @xcite .",
    "these results are indicative of the great potential of lfd for a fundamental description of non - perturbative effects in strong interactions .",
    "this approach may also provide a bridge between the two different pictures of hadronic matter , i.e. the constituent quark model ( cqm ) ( or the quark parton model ) closely related to experimental observations and the qcd based on a covariant non - abelian quantum field theory .",
    "again , the key to possible connection between the two pictures is the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation given by eq.([eq.02 ] ) that leads to a relatively simple vacuum structure .",
    "there is no spontaneous creation of massive fermions in the lf quantized vacuum .",
    "thus , one can immediately obtain a constituent - type picture @xcite in which all partons in a hadronic state are connected directly to the hadron instead of being simply disconnected excitations ( or vacuum fluctuations ) in a complicated medium .",
    "a possible realization of chiral symmetry breaking in the lf vacuum has also been discussed in the literature @xcite .    moreover ,",
    "the poincar algebra in the ordinary equal-@xmath0 quantization is drastically changed in the light - front equal-@xmath8 quantization . in lfd , the maximum number ( seven ) of the ten poincare generators are kinematic ( i.e. interaction independent ) and they leave the state at @xmath21 unchanged  @xcite .",
    "however , the transverse rotation whose direction is perpendicular to the direction of the quantization axis @xmath22 at equal @xmath8 becomes a dynamical problem in lfd because the quantization surface @xmath8 is not invariant under the transverse rotation and the transverse angular momentum operator involves the interaction that changes the particle number @xcite .",
    "leutwyler and stern showed that the angular momentum operators can be redefined to satisfy the su(2 ) spin algebra and the commutation relation between mass operator and spin operators  @xcite ; @xmath23 = i { \\epsilon_{ijk } } { \\cal{j}}_k,\\ ] ] @xmath24 = 0.\\ ] ] nonetheless , in lfd , there are two dynamic equations to solve : @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the total angular momentum ( or spin ) and the mass eigenvalues of the hadron ( @xmath27 ) are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , it is not a trivial matter to specify the total angular momentum of a specific hadron state .    as a step towards understanding the conversion of the dynamical problem from boost to rotation",
    ", we constructed the poincar algebra interpolating between instant and light - front time quantizations  @xcite .",
    "we used an orthogonal coordinate system which interpolates smoothly between the equal - time and the light - front quantization hypersurface .",
    "thus , our interpolating coordinate system had a nice feature of tracing the fate of the poincare algebra at equal time as the hypersurface approaches to the light - front limit .",
    "the same method of interpolating hypersurfaces has been used by hornbostel @xcite to analyze various aspects of field theories including the issue of nontrivial vacuum .",
    "the same vein of application to study the axial anomaly in the schwinger model has also been presented @xcite , and other related works @xcite can also be found in the literature .    in the present work ,",
    "we introduce the interpolating scattering amplitude that links the corresponding time - ordered amplitudes between the two forms of dynamics . we exemplify the physical meaning of the kinematic transformations in contrast to the dynamic transformations by means of checking the invariance of each individual time - ordered amplitude for an arbitrary interpolation angle .",
    "our analysis further clarifies why and how the longitudinal boost is kinematical only in the lfd but not in any other interpolation angle dynamics including ifd . in particular , we show the disappearance of the connected contributions to the current arising from the vacuum when the interpolation angle is taken to yield the lfd .",
    "since we do nt need any infinite momentum frame ( imf ) to show this disappearance and our proof is completely independent of reference frames , it resolves the confusion between the lfd and the imf that sometimes appears in the discussion on related topics .",
    "the well - known utility of imf usually discussed in the instant form dynamics is now also extended to any other interpolation angle dynamics using our interpolating scattering amplitudes .    in the next section , section [ sec.02 ] ,",
    "we introduce the interpolating scattering amplitude that links the corresponding time - ordered amplitudes between the two forms of dynamics and show the disappearance of the connected contributions to the current arising from the vacuum when the interpolation angle is taken to yield the lfd . taking just the simplest possible example ( viz .",
    "spin - less scalar particles ) and keeping only the fundamental degrees of freedom , i.e. particle momenta , we focus only on the essential part of the time - ordered scattering amplitude , namely the energy denominators . in section [ sec.03 ] , we discuss the kinematic transformations that allow the invariance of each individual time - ordered amplitude for an arbitrary interpolation angle and present the explicit results of particle momenta under those kinematic transformations . in this section",
    ", we also discuss a remarkable difference of the lfd result compared to the result for any other interpolation angle dynamics including ifd and the role of the longitudinal boost that becomes kinematic only in lfd . in section [ sec.04 ] , we explicitly show the invariance of the individual time - ordered amplitude under kinematic transformations plotting the results obtained in section [ sec.03 ] and extend the well - known utility of imf in ifd to an arbitrary interpolation angle dynamics .",
    "conclusions follow in section[sec.05 ] .",
    "we begin by adopting the following convention of the space - time coordinates to define the interpolating angle : [ interpolangle ] = , and = , in which the interpolating angle is allowed to run from 0 through @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "all the indices with the wide - hat notation signify the variables with the interpolation angle @xmath32 .",
    "for the limit @xmath33 we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 so that we recover usual space - time coordinates although the z - axis is inverted while for the other extreme limit , @xmath36 we have @xmath37 which leads to the standard light - front coordinates .",
    "of course , the same interpolation applies to the momentum variables : [ interpolangle - momentum ] = .",
    "for any two interpolating four vector variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the scalar product @xmath40 must be identical to @xmath41 and is given by [ scalar - product ] a _",
    "b^ = ( a^+b^+-a^-b^-)2+(a^+b^-+a^-b^+)2-a^1b^1-a^2b^2 .",
    "we may define & = & 2 , + & = & 2 , + _ & = & a^1 + a^2 , for shorthand notations and convenience , so that the minkowski space - time metric @xmath42 with interpolating angle may be written as g^ = = g_. thus , the covariant and contravariant indices are related by [ definitions ] a_+ = a^++a^- & ; & a^+ = a_++a_- + a_- = a^+-a^- & ; & a^- = a_+-a_- + a _",
    "= -a^ & , & .",
    "as the coordinate variable @xmath43 plays the role of the time evolution parameter and the canonical conjugate energy variable is @xmath44 in lfd , we also take @xmath45 to be the evolution parameter and the conjugate energy variables with the corresponding subscripts , e.g. , @xmath46 .",
    "now , we discuss the scattering amplitude of two spin - less particles , e.g. an analogue of the well known qed annihilation / production process @xmath47 in a toy @xmath48 model theory , as depicted in fig.[fig:1 ] . in this work we do not involve spins and any other degrees of freedom except the fundamental degrees of freedom , i.e. particle momenta , for the simplest possible illustration .",
    "although we discuss here just this simple scattering amplitude , the bare - bone structure that we demonstrate in this analysis will be commonly applicable to any extended calculation of amplitudes including other degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , not only the basic structure of the amplitudes but also the fundamental degrees of freedom to describe the scattering process will prevail in such extension .",
    "further complications from other degrees of freedom beyond the particle momenta would appear separately without modifying the energy denominator structure that we discuss in this work : e.g. , the terms associated with the spin degrees of freedom in qed would appear as the matrix elements in the numerator but not in the denominator of the amplitude .",
    "the extension of the present work to the gauge field theories involving other degrees of freedom such as qed and qcd is in progress . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the basic structure of the scattering amplitudes , i.e. the energy denominators , considering only the fundamental degrees of freedom , i.e. particle momenta .",
    "modulo inessential factors including the square of the coupling constant , the lowest order tree - level feynman diagram shown in fig.[fig:1 ] is proportional to the propagator of the intermediate particle , that is , = where @xmath49 is the mandelstam variable which is invariant under any poincar transformations and @xmath9 is the mass of the intermediate boson .",
    "of course , the physical process can take place only above the threshold @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mass of the final particle and anti - particle that are produced , e.g. like the muon mass in the @xmath52 scatterring process . in the ifd , where the initial conditions are set on the hyperplane @xmath53 and the system evolves with the ordinary time @xmath54 ,",
    "this manifestly covariant feynman amplitude is decomposed into the corresponding two time - ordered amplitudes , graphically represented in fig.[fig:2](a ) and fig.[fig:2](b ) .    .",
    "]    these two time - ordered amplitudes correspond respectively to the following analytic expressions : ^a_ifd = ( ) , and ^b_ifd = - ( ) .",
    "it is not difficulty to show that the sum of the time - ordered amplitudes is identical to the manifestly covariant feynman amplitude : [ ifd_amp ] _ ifd & = & _ a^ifd + _",
    "b^ifd + & = & ( - ) + & = & , where the conservation of the three momentum @xmath55 as well as the energy - momentum dispersion relation @xmath56 in ifd is used to get the covariant denominator @xmath57 in the last step .    to obtain the corresponding time - ordered amplitudes in an arbitrary interpolating angle @xmath32",
    ", we just need to change the superscript 0 of the ifd energy variables in the energy denominators to the superscipt @xmath58 and multiply an overall factor @xmath59 to the amplitudes : i.e. [ sigma_interpol_a ] ^a _ = ( ) , and [ sigma_interpol_b ] ^b _ = - ( ) . the overall factor",
    "@xmath59 is necessary because the energy of the particle with the four - momentum @xmath60 in an arbitrary interpolation angle is given by @xmath61 while the contravariant @xmath62 used in the interpolating amplitudes is related to the covariant @xmath61 with the factor @xmath59 as shown in eq.([definitions ] ) , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "note here that the factor @xmath64 in front of the longitudinal momentum @xmath65 is irrelevant because the longitudinal momenta of the initial particles must be cancelled by the longitudinal momentum of the intermediate particle due to the conservation of the longitudinal momentum .",
    "again , it is not so difficulty to show that the sum of the time - ordered amplitudes for any angle @xmath32 is identical to the manifestly covariant feynman amplitude : [ iad_amp ] _ & = & _ ^a + _ ^b + & = & ( - ) + & = & , where we used the relation between the covariant and contravariant indices ( see eq.([definitions ] ) ) such as @xmath66 and the conservation of momenta @xmath67 and @xmath68 as well as the four - momentum scalar product relation ( see eq.([scalar - product ] ) ) to get the lorentz invariant denominator @xmath57 in the last step .",
    "it is also rather easy to see that eq.([iad_amp ] ) becomes eq.([ifd_amp ] ) as @xmath69 goes to the unity . in lfd",
    "however , i.e. as @xmath69 goes to zero , the denominator in the first amplitude @xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71 goes to infinity due to the conservation @xmath72 but the multiplication of @xmath73 with this infinity makes the finite result @xmath74 , while the second amplitude @xmath75 is wiped out due to @xmath73 .",
    "this result is akin to the very well - known result from the work entitled `` dynamics at infinite momentum '' @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to make it clear that the disappearance of the second amplitude @xmath75 in lfd is different from the usual imf result obtained by taking @xmath76 with @xmath77 for a shorthand notation ( e.g. @xmath78 ) .",
    "as far as any correlation between the interpolation angle @xmath32 and the total longitudinal momentum @xmath79 is avoided , our derivation is completely independent of the frame and the only relevant parameter to show this disappearance is the interpolation angle @xmath32 which has nothing to do with the choice of reference frame . in section [ sec.04 ] , we will discuss the special case with a particular correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath79 and the associated treacherous point similar to the zero - mode issue in lfd .",
    "for the rest of this section , we elaborate more details of our derivations discussed above .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath80 in terms of interpolating angle variables results in a quadratic equation in @xmath81 and @xmath82 that can be solved for the energy variable @xmath81 in terms of momentum components @xmath83 and @xmath84 as well as mass @xmath9 : [ drsolution ] q_+ = , in which we introduced the notation [ omegaq ] _ q = .",
    "for the physical solution with positive energy in eq .",
    "( [ drsolution ] ) , we must take q_+ = , which identifies @xmath85 as _ q = q_+ + q_- = q^+ . for @xmath86 and @xmath87 ,",
    "@xmath88 becomes @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . using this variable @xmath85 , we may rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ sigma_interpol_a ] ) and ( [ sigma_interpol_b ] ) as follows : _ ^a & = & + _ ^b & = & , where [ d+d- ] d_+ & = & p_+ + + d_- & = & p_+ + , in which we used the longitudinal momentum conservation @xmath91 .",
    "the sum of both contributions given by eq .",
    "( [ iad_amp ] ) can then be expressed as [ sum ] _ & = & ^a",
    "_ + ^b _ + & = & ( - ) , which is identical to the second line of eq.([iad_amp ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) , we can confirm @xmath92 : _ & = & + & = & + & = & + & = & , where we used @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . using eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) , we may now recapture the instant form and light - front limits , as follows .    for the instant form limit ( ifd )",
    ", we have @xmath33 ( i.e. @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 . in this limit",
    ", it is apparent that eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) becomes _ 0 _ ifd = ( - ) = ( - ) , where @xmath86 is taken in the interpolating angle variables .",
    "for the light - front limit ( lfd ) , @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) , we expand @xmath85 given by eq.([omegaq ] ) in the orders of @xmath101 and get _ q q_- + + o(^2 ) . substituting this expansion of @xmath85 in the denominator of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) , we get & & -+o ( ) + & & - . for the second denominator in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) , however , we get & & -+o ( ) + & & .",
    "thus , in the light - front limit ( @xmath99 ) , the contribution from the second diagram vanishes and [ lfd ] _ = = , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are same with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , due to the momentum conservation in lfd .",
    "again , we would like to make it clear that the disappearance of the second amplitude @xmath75 in lfd is different from what has been known from the usual imf , i.e. @xmath76 . as we will discuss in the next section , section [ sec.03 ] , the longitudinal boost is kinematic in lfd so that the disappearance of the connected contribution @xmath106 to the current arising from the vacuum is independent of @xmath79 or the imf .",
    "this is certainly not the case for any other interpolation case , i.e. @xmath107 . the longitudinal boost becomes dynamic for @xmath107 and the contributions from @xmath108 and @xmath109 depend on @xmath79 ( or the reference frames ) and the well - known utility of imf can be extended to an arbitrary interpolating angle @xmath110 .",
    "we will discuss more on this point in section [ sec.04 ] after we present the physical meaning of the kinematic transformations in section [ sec.03 ] .",
    "as we presented in the previous section , section [ sec.02 ] , the sum of all the time - ordered amplitudes ( just two in our example discussed in section  [ sec.02 ] ) must be independent of the interpolation angle @xmath32 and identical to the manifestly covariant feynman amplitude .",
    "although the total amplitude is poincar invariant , the individual time - ordered amplitude is neither invariant in general nor independent of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , one may ask a question if the individual time - ordered amplitude can be invariant at least under some subset of poincar generators .",
    "the answer is yes and this issue is what we would like to address in this section .",
    "the point is that the individual time - ordered amplitude would not change as far as the time evolution parameter @xmath111 does nt change so that the individual time - ordered amplitude would be invariant under a certain transformation which does nt alter the time evolution parameter @xmath111 . to the extent that the time evolution parameter @xmath111 does nt change , all the momentum components with @xmath112 such as @xmath113 would not change because the same transformation rules apply to both the space - time coordinates and the four - momenta of the particles involved .",
    "such subset of the poincar group that does nt alter the time evolution parameter @xmath111 is known as the stability group . since the transformations that belong to the stability group",
    "do not modify the time evolution parameter @xmath111 , each time - ordered amplitude must be invariant under these transformations .",
    "individual time - ordered amplitudes represent the dynamics given at each instant of time defined by the time evolution parameter @xmath111 in the given form of the relativistic quantum field theory . for this reason",
    ", it may be appropriate for the transformations that leave each individual time - ordered amplitudes invariant to be called as the _ kinematic transformations _ and the generators of those transformations belong to the stability group deserve to be distinguished from the other poincar group generators .",
    "all other poincar group generators besides the kinematic generators are dynamical and change the contributions from each individual time - ordered amplitudes . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the kinematic transformations for an arbitrary interpolation angle @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , we take the limits to @xmath86 and @xmath114 to discuss the fates of the kinematic transformations in the two distinguished forms of the relativistic dynamics , ifd and lfd , respectively .",
    "since we focus mainly on the fundamental dynamic variables not involving any other degrees of freedom ( e.g. spins ) in this work , our results of the kinematic transformations apply explicitly only to the particle momenta",
    ".    the matrix of the homogeneous part of poincar group in the interpolating angle basis may be written@xcite as [ matrix ] m _ = where [ generators3 ] k^1 = -k^1-j^2 & ; & k^2 = j^1-k^2 + d^1 = -k^1+j^2 & ; & d^2 = -j^1-k^2 .",

    "one may note the swap of the roles between `` boosts '' and `` rotations '' in the two forms of relativistic dynamics , ifd and lfd , and utilize it for some hadron phenomenology@xcite .",

    "( [ generators1 ] ) and the interpolating poincar algebra presented in ref.@xcite : [ commutatorzero ] & = & c - s + & = & c(-ip^s)-s(-ip^c ) = 0 .",
    "this means that each transformation of the form @xmath128 , ( @xmath129 ) , leaves the momentum operator @xmath130 invariant .",
    "as a consequence if the momentum @xmath131 is an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath127 , @xmath131 remains invariant under the cited transformations .",
    "likewise , the plus ( @xmath132 ) component of any four vector is invariant under such transformations and the time @xmath133 remains invariant as well .",

    "thus , the generators @xmath135 are dynamic .    among the elements involved in the matrix given by eq.([matrix ] ) , it is interesting to note that the rotation around the longitudinal direction , i.e. @xmath139 , is unique because it does nt change @xmath45 and thus kinematic for any interpolation angle @xmath32 .",
    "however , the longitudinal boost @xmath140 has a quite different characteristic compared to any other operators in eq.([matrix ] ) . to see this , let s look at the commutator between @xmath127 and @xmath140 in the poincar algebra : & = & ip_- + & = & i ( ^+-^- ) , which leads to [ k3p+ ] & = & i p^+ in the limit @xmath36 .",

    "although the right hand side of eq.([k3p+ ] ) does nt vanish , it yields the same @xmath141 operator in the commutation relation .",
    "this means that the eigenvalues of @xmath141 operator , or the lf longitudinal momentum @xmath104 , are just scaled by the factor @xmath142 when it is boosted in the longitudinal direction by the rapidity @xmath143 . by the same token",

    "it may be interesting to note that the algebra among @xmath146 and @xmath140 works just the similar way as the algebra among the creation , annihilation and number operators in one - dimensional simple harmonic oscillator . due to the conservation of three momenta ( @xmath147 ) as well as the compensating scale factors of @xmath145 and @xmath142 between the lf energy ( @xmath144 ) and the lf longitudinal momentum ( @xmath104 )",
    ", one can show that each individual lf time - ordered amplitudes are invariant under the longitudinal boost @xmath140 .",
    "this may be also understood from the intactness of the lf time @xmath43 modulo the same scaling factor @xmath142 for the lf longitudinal momentum under the @xmath140 operation . with this reasoning",
    ", one may understand that @xmath140 becomes the kinematic generator in lfd although it is dynamical for any other interpolation angle @xmath148 . as the boost problem in ifd is one of the most difficult problems to deal with in the relativistic many - body calculations , all of the boost operators ( @xmath149 ) have been known as difficult operators in ifd . since at least @xmath140 can change its difficult characteristic to a good one , i.e. from dynamic to kinematic , and joins the stability group in lfd , one may regard such dramatic character change of @xmath140 in lfd as a kind of `` return of a prodigal son '' .",
    "of course , the community of lfd welcomes the addition of @xmath140 in the stability group . for this reason ,",

    "i.e. , in lfd , however , @xmath140 is kinematic and the corresponding frame dependence of each individual time - ordered amplitudes can not be applied . instead , what we take advantage of in this work is that the individual time - ordered interpolating scattering amplitudes are dependent on @xmath32 and the time - ordered amplitudes connected to the current arising from the vacuum vanishes in the limit @xmath154 , e.g. @xmath155 ( and thus @xmath156 ) as we showed in section ii . since @xmath140 is kinematic in lfd , each individual time - ordered amplitudes are invariant under the longitudinal boost ( or independent of the corresponding change of reference frames ) , e.g. @xmath156 or @xmath155 is independent of the total momentum @xmath79 of the system . in the case of @xmath156 or @xmath155 , one may note that the individual time - ordered amplitudes are indeed invariant under all poincar transformations because the first time - ordered amplitude takes up the whole result of the feynman amplitude . in the more general case of lfd where a given physical process involves more than one non - vanishing time - ordered amplitudes , the individual time - ordered amplitudes are not invariant under the dynamic transformations @xmath157 and @xmath158 but invariant under the kinematic transformations shown in table [ table1 ] including @xmath140 in lfd . for the interpolating scattering amplitudes of @xmath110 , the individual time - ordered amplitudes are not invariant under the four ( instead of three ) dynamic transformations but invariant under the six ( instead of seven ) kinematic transformations shown in table [ table1 ] .    to discuss more details of the invariance of the individual time - ordered amplitudes under the kinematic transformations ,",
    "we now revisit the previous analysis@xcite on the transformations of the particle momentum components under the kinematic transformations , @xmath159 , and extend the analysis to include the effect of @xmath140 transformation in order to cover the case of time - ordered amplitudes in lfd .",
    "the transformations of the particle momentum components under other kinematic transformations such as @xmath160 and @xmath161 are rather trivial , in the sense that the particle momentum components @xmath162 and @xmath163 as well as the magnitude @xmath164 are invariant under these transformations , and we do not discuss them here .    to analyze the particle momentum components under the @xmath165 and @xmath140 transformations , we consider both the longitudinal transformation @xmath166 and the transverse transformation @xmath167 .",
    "in particular , we follow the procedure set by jacob and wick@xcite in defining the helicities in ifd , namely @xmath168 first and @xmath169 later , as the spin in the rest frame is initially aligned in the z - direction and the boost in the z - direction first would not change the spin direction for the procedure of defining helicities . although we do not involve any spin degrees of freedom in this work , we adopt the same procedure to be consistent when we extend this work later for the spinor case . as discussed in ref.@xcite",
    ", this procedure of applying @xmath168 first and @xmath169 later is common also in defining the lf helicities .    having this is mind",
    ", we first apply @xmath166 to each of the momentum operator components @xmath170 : t_3^ p_t_3 & = & e^i_3 k^3 p _ e^-i_3 k^3 + & = & p _ + i+ + this yields [ t3 ] t_3^",

    ", one can find that the operation of @xmath176 and @xmath173 to the state @xmath171 yields the eigenvalues @xmath175 and @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "thus , the results given in eq.([t3 ] ) can be translated into [ t3-eigen ] p_+ & = & ( _ 3 - _ 3 ) p_++_3p_- + p_- & = & ( _ 3 + _ 3 ) p_-+_3p_+ + p^ & = & p^ , ( = 1,2 ) .",
    "this result satisfies the energy - momentum dispersion relation as it should : p_g^p _ & = & _ + ^2 + 2_+ p_--^2-_^2 + & = & p_+^2 + 2p_+p_--p_-^2-_^2 + & = & m^2 . taking the limit @xmath33 in eq.([t3-eigen ] ) , we get [ t3ifd ] p^0 & = & _ 3p^0+_3p^3 + p^3 & = & _ 3p^3+_3p^0 + p^j & = & p^j , ( j=1 , 2 ) , which are the usual lorentz transformations along the @xmath22-direction in ifd .",
    "taking the limit @xmath36 , on the other hand , we get [ t3lfd ] p^- & = & e^-_3p^- + p^+ & = & e^_3p^+ + p^j & = & p^j , ( j=1,2 ) , which are the expected results in lfd since @xmath104 and @xmath144 are decoupled with the corresponding scaling factors .",
    "this result confirms that @xmath168 is kinematical in lfd .",
    "after the @xmath168 ( longitudinal ) transformation , we now take the @xmath169 ( transverse ) transformation following the jacob and wick s procedure as mentioned above . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the effect of @xmath169 transformation on the momentum operator @xmath177 was obtained as follows : [ t12 ] t_12^ p_+t_12 & = & p_+ + _ ^2 _ - - ( _ 1 p^1+_2 p^2 ) + t_12^ p_-t_12 & = & p_-+ ( _ 1 p^1+_2 p^2 ) + t_12^ p^t_12 & = & p^-_j _",
    "-+_j(_1 p^1+_2 p^2 ) , ( j=1,2 ) where we have defined @xmath178 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this result indicates a dramatic difference in the outcome of the particle momentum after the application of the kinematic transformation @xmath167 to the particle in the rest frame between ifd ( @xmath179 ) and lfd ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the particle of mass @xmath51 in the rest frame ( i.e. @xmath181 ) has the interpolating momentum components given by @xmath182 .",
    "if we write the interpolating momentum components with the prime notation after the @xmath169 transformation , we get [ t12a ] p_+ & = & m + p_- & = & m + p^ & = & -m_j ( = , ) , which shows that the particle can gain some longitudinal momentum although the transformation @xmath169 is transversal and the amount of the gained longitudinal momentum depends on the interpolating angle @xmath32 . in ifd ( @xmath86 ) , the particle in the rest frame remains in the rest frame since @xmath169 is just a transverse rotation : i.e. @xmath183 .",
    "however , in lfd ( @xmath184 ) , the result given by eq.([t12 ] ) can be written as p^- & = & ( 1 + ) + p^+ & = & + p^j & = & -_j , ( j=1,2 ) . from this , we find the energy and longitudinal momentum components are related to the transverse momentum @xmath185 , i.e. [ rel - lf ] p^0 & = & m+ + p^3 & = & - which shows that the particle gains the longitudinal momentum @xmath186 while the particle is transversely boosted by @xmath187 .",
    "one should note that the lf transverse boosts @xmath188 and @xmath189 involve not only @xmath122 ( ordinary transverse boosts ) but also @xmath123 ( ordinary transverse rotation ) so that the particle s moving direction can not be kept just in the transverse direction while the particle is transversely boosted .",
    "this yields the momentum in the longitudinal direction as well as in the transverse direction .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the relativistic energy - momentum dispersion relation works although the particle energy takes a non - relativistic form : ( p^0)^2-^2 = ( m+)^2-_^2-(-)^2 = m^2 .",
    "this may be regarded as another distinguishing feature of the lfd .",
    "we now apply the @xmath169 transformation subsequently after we do the @xmath168 transformation in order to combine the longitudinal boost and the transverse kinematic transformations , i.e. @xmath190 .",
    "this allows not only the transformation of the unprimed @xmath174 to primed @xmath175 but also the subsequent transformation from the primed four - momentum @xmath175 to the double - primed four - momentum @xmath191 of the particle that we consider . under the @xmath192 transformation ,",

    ", the transverse vector @xmath195 can be represented by @xmath196 defining the angle @xmath197 and the rotation axis as the unit transverse vector @xmath198 because the kinematic transformations @xmath199 and @xmath200 are nothing but the ordinary transverse rotations @xmath201 and @xmath202 , respectively , in ifd . since @xmath203 , one may identify @xmath204 and @xmath205 to rewrite eq.([ifd ] ) as [ ifd1 ] p^0 & = & _ 3 p^0 + _ 3 p^ 3 + p^ 3 & = & ( _ 3 p^0 + _ 3 p^3 ) + ( _ ) _ + _ & = & _ - ( _ ) ( _ 3 p^0 + _ 3 p^3 ) + & + & ( _ ) ( -1 ) ( _ ) _ . taking @xmath206 ( i.e. @xmath207 ) , we have [ ifd2 ] p^0 & = & p^0 = _ 3 p^0 + _ 3 p^3 + p^1 & = & -p^3 + p^1 = -(_3 p^0 + _ 3 p^3 ) + p^1 + p^2 & = & p^2 = p^2 + p^3 & = & p^3 + p^1 = ( _ 3 p^0 + _ 3 p^3 ) + p^1 , where the boost in @xmath208 direction and the subsequent rotation around @xmath209 axis are manifest .",
    "next , we consider the other extreme that corresponds to the lfd , @xmath87 . as @xmath36,@xmath210 and it leads to the following limits for the expressions that appear in the different components of momentum given by eq.([general_kinematic ] ) : ( 1-^2 ) & & + & & + & & 1 .",
    "using the usual lfd notations , we thus get p^- & = & e^-_3p^-+p^+- _ _ + p^+ & = & e^_3 p^+ + _ & = & _ - e^_3 _ p^+ , which satisfies the lf dispersion relation as expected 2p^+p^- -_^2 = 2p^+p^- -_^2 = m^2 . in the case",
    "that the particle is at rest in the unprimed frame , i.e. p^+ & = & p^- = + _ & = & 0 , we obtain p^- & = & ( e^-_3+e^_3 ) + p^+ & = & e^_3 +  _ & = & - _ e^_3 , which can be translated into p^0 & = & m _ 3 + _ ^2 e^_3 + p^3 & = & m _ 3 - _ ^2 e^_3 + _ & = & - _ e^_3 . from this , we may extend the relation between the energy and the transverse momentum ( as well as between the longitudinal momentum and the transverse momentum ) given by eq.([rel - lf ] ) as [ extend - rel - lf ] p^0 & = & m _ 3 + e^-_3 + p^3 & = & m _ 3 - e^-_3 .",
    "for @xmath211 , this equation is reduced to eq.([rel - lf ] ) . as we explained about eq.([rel - lf ] ) , the gained longitudinal momentum is correlated with the transverse momentum due to the kinematic transformation @xmath187 in such a way that a paraboloid shape of surface ( note @xmath212 for @xmath211 ) can be drawn for the gained momentum components in the momentum space as shown in ref.@xcite . in the case @xmath213 , we find that the similar shapes of paraboloids can be drawn . however , the corresponding paraboloids are shifted in the longitudinal direction as @xmath143 gets more positive values and the curvatures of the corresponding paraboloids get modified as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "this plot shows three surfaces corresponding to three different values of @xmath214 , with the momenta scaled by the mass of the particle , i.e. @xmath215 , in the range @xmath216 and @xmath217 . for the positive values of @xmath143 as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] , the paraboloid of @xmath211 is shifted to upwards in @xmath218 and gets flattened due to the factors given by @xmath219 and @xmath145 in eq.([extend - rel - lf ] ) , respectively .",
    "the top point of each paraboloid corresponds to the momentum gained by the @xmath220 transformation in ifd ( see eq.([t3ifd ] ) ) .",
    "although the particle at rest stays at rest in ifd when only the kinematic transformation @xmath169 ( i.e. the ordinary transverse rotation in ifd ) is applied , the longitudinal boost @xmath168 is dynamical in ifd so that it can generate the longitudinal momentum of the particle .",
    "however , in lfd , both @xmath169 and @xmath168 are kinematic transformations and the entire momentum region of @xmath221 can be covered by these kinematic transformations .",
    "in the previous sections , we discussed that the scattering amplitude in fig.[fig:1 ] has two non - vanishing time - ordered contributions in an arbitrary interpolating angle for the range @xmath110 including ifd ( @xmath179 ) while in lfd ( @xmath87 ) only the contribution of the first diagram fig.[fig:2]a survives .",
    "we now apply the transformations of the particle momenta that we obtained in the last section , section  [ sec.03 ] , to the scattering amplitudes and discuss a quantitative measure on the invariance of the individual time - ordered amplitudes under the kinematic transformations . in order to see this in an arbitrary interpolating angle ,",

    "thus , if the limit @xmath36 is taken in the exact correlation with @xmath79 given by the @xmath243-shaped curve , i.e. @xmath248 , then the connected contribution to the current arising from the vacuum @xmath249 does not vanish but remains as a nonzero constant , i.e. @xmath250 , although this nonzero constant ( i.e. the minimum of @xmath249 ) is cancelled by the same magnitude of the constant ( i.e. the maximum of @xmath251 ) given by @xmath252 to yield the total amplitude @xmath253",

    "the addition of @xmath140 in the stability group is a great advantage of lfd in hadron phenomenology@xcite .",
    "computing the individual time - ordered amplitudes for the whole range of total momentum @xmath79 and the interpolating angle @xmath32 , we showed not only the invariance of the sum of time - ordered amplitudes but also the behavior of each individual time - ordered amplitudes ( see fig .",

    "our work demonstrates a rather clear distinction between the well - known imf result in ifd and the lfd result on the disappearance of the connected contribution to the current from the vacuum .",

    "thus , if one takes the interpolating angle to the limit of @xmath264 in an exact correlation with the limit @xmath255 following the @xmath243-shaped curve , then one should be careful not to miss the contribution from the minimum value of @xmath265 which must be cancelled by the maximum value of @xmath266 .",

    "<S> among the three forms of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics proposed by dirac in 1949 , the instant form and the front form can be interpolated by introducing an interpolation angle between the ordinary time @xmath0 and the light - front time @xmath1 . using this method </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the interpolating scattering amplitude that links the corresponding time - ordered amplitudes between the two forms of dynamics and provide the physical meaning of the kinematic transformations as they allow the invariance of each individual time - ordered amplitude for an arbitrary interpolation angle . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it exhibits that the longitudinal boost is kinematical only in the front form dynamics , or the light - front dynamics ( lfd ) , but not in any other interpolation angle dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it also shows that the disappearance of the connected contributions to the current arising from the vacuum occurs when the interpolation angle is taken to yield the lfd . </S>",
    "<S> since it does nt require the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) to show this disappearance and the proof is independent of reference frames , it resolves the confusion between the lfd and the imf . </S>",
    "<S> the well - known utility of imf usually discussed in the instant form dynamics is now also extended to any other interpolation angle dynamics using our interpolating scattering amplitudes .    permanent address : instituto de fsica terica - unesp universidade estadual paulista , + rua dr . </S>",
