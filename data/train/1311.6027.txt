    "during the last decade , several significant model - free formulas , describing the asymptotic behavior of the implied volatility at extreme strikes , were found .",
    "we only mention here r. lee s moment formulas ( see @xcite ) , tail - wing formulas due to s. benaim and p. friz ( see @xcite , see also @xcite ) , asymptotic formulas with error estimates established by the author ( see @xcite ) , andhigher order formulas found by k. gao and r. lee ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the book @xcite by the author for more information .",
    "the present work was inspired by the paper @xcite of s. de marco , c. hillairet , and a. jacquier .",
    "the authors of @xcite obtained interesting results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the implied volatility at small strikes in the case where the asset price distribution has an atom at zero ( see theorem 3.7 in @xcite ) .",
    "special examples of such models are the constant elasticity of variance model , jump - to - default models , and stochastic models described by processes stopped at the first hitting time of zero ( more information can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that the right - wing behavior of the implied volatility in models with and without atoms is similar .",
    "therefore , general model - free asymptotic formulas for the implied volatility at large strikes , discussed in chapter 9 of @xcite , can be used in stochastic asset price models with atoms .",
    "however , the left - wing behavior of the implied volatility in models with and without atoms is qualitatively different . this fact was noticed and explored in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the general formula formulated in corollary 9.31 in @xcite , which describes the left - wing behavior of the implied volatility in terms of the put pricing function , holds for asset price models with atoms ( see formula ( [ e : a ] ) below ) .",
    "for such models , the above - mentioned formula provides only the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the implied volatility and an error estimate .",
    "the authors of @xcite found a sharper asymptotic formula , characterizing the left - wing behavior of the implied volatility in models with atoms ( see formula ( [ e : one ] ) below ) .",
    "note that the impact of an atom at zero on the left - wing asymptotics of the implied volatility was not taken into account in section 9.9 of @xcite .",
    "this omission led to an incorrect description of the asymptotic behavior of the implied volatility at small strikes in the cev model ( see formula ( 11.22 ) in theorem 11.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "only the absolutely continuous part of the distribution of the asset price was taken into account in formula ( 11.22 ) mentioned above , while the influence of the atom at zero was ignored .    in this paper",
    ", we establish new asymptotic formulas for the implied volatility at small strikes in models with atoms ( see formulas ( [ e : imvol2 ] ) , ( [ e : imvol222 ] ) , and ( [ e : imvol22 ] ) below ) .",
    "these formulas contain three explicit terms in the asymptotic expansion of the implied volatility and an error estimate .",
    "note that the asymptotic formula found in @xcite contains two terms and only an incomplete information about the third term is provided .",
    "moreover , there is a qualitative difference between the new formulas and the de marco - hillairet - jacquer formula . in the new formulas , we use the inverse function of a strike - dependent function , while the inverse function of the cumulative standard normal distribution function is employed in @xcite .",
    "it is shown numerically in section [ s : num ] of the present paper that formula ( [ e : imvol22 ] ) provides a significantly better approximation to the left wing of the implied volatility in the constant elasticity of variance model than the de marco - hillairet - jacquier formula .",
    "our next goal is to introduce several known objects , which will be used in the rest of the paper , and then formulate our main results .",
    "the asset price will be modeled by a non - negative martingale @xmath0 defined on a filtered probability space @xmath1 .",

    "moreover , we assume that @xmath22 for all @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "the first of the previous restrictions guarantees that @xmath24 exists for all @xmath21 , while under the second restriction , the implied volatility @xmath24 exists for all @xmath25 ( more details can be found in section 9.1 of @xcite ) .",

    "we also have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a positive function such that @xmath47    the proof of ( [ e : r2 ] ) and ( [ e : m ] ) is simple .",

    "hence , @xmath52 now it is clear that ( [ e : lim ] ) implies ( [ e : r2 ] ) .",
    "finally , the proof of the equality in ( [ e : r1 ] ) for asset price models with atoms is the same as the proof of lemma 9.23 in @xcite .",
    "[ r : distd ] we denote by @xmath53 and @xmath54 the cumulative distribution functions of the random variable @xmath50 on @xmath55 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "these functions are given by @xmath56 it is clear that @xmath57 @xmath58    we have already mentioned the asymptotic formula in corollary 9.31 in @xcite .",
