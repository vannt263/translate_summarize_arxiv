    "the very metal - poor stars , presently found in the halo of the galaxy , are believed to have formed at the earliest times , shortly after it became possible for the universe to make stars with sufficiently long main - sequence lifetimes ( i.e. , masses @xmath11 ) to survive for @xmath12 gyr .",
    "the chemical compositions of these stars are thus expected to reflect a quite small number of nucleosynthesis processes , possibly as small as one , while the compositions of more metal - rich stars like the sun reflect the cumulative ( hence quite complex ) results of the various processes that have been in operation during the entire history of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "recent abundance analyses for extremely metal - poor stars have provided quite valuable information on the individual nucleosynthesis processes involved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , detailed abundance studies of heavy metals in such stars have led to important progress in the understanding of the origin of neutron - capture elements in the early galaxy .",
    "sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2000 , 2003 ) have studied the abundances of the extremely metal - poor star cs  22892052 , the first example of a growing class of metal - poor stars that exhibit very large excesses of r - process elements relative to iron ( [ r - process / fe ] @xmath13 ) .",
    "even from the first analysis , it was apparent that the relative abundance pattern of the heavy neutron - capture elements ( 56 @xmath6 _ z _ @xmath6 76 ) in this star was identical ( within observational errors ) to that of the ( inferred ) solar system r - process component , which has been strengthened as more and better data have been acquired .",
    "this striking similarity may be surprising , considering that the abundance pattern of the solar system has certainly been influenced by the integrated yields from a variety of nucleosynthesis sites .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in contrast , the abundance pattern of the lighter neutron - capture elements ( @xmath14 ) in cs  22892052 exhibit clear deviations from that of the solar - system r - process component @xcite .",
    "recent analyses of a small number of additional very metal - poor stars with moderate excesses of r - process elements ( @xmath15 [ r - process / fe ] @xmath16 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have obtained similar results , that is , the abundance pattern of heavy neutron - capture elements ( @xmath17 ) for each star is quite similar to that of the r - process component in solar - system material .",
    "these results imply that the neutron - capture elements in these very metal - poor stars were produced by the r - process , which produces quite similar abundance patterns at least for the range of @xmath18 ( schatz et al .",
    "2002 ; wanajo et al .",
    "2002 ; otsuki , mathews , & kajino 2003 ) . by way of contrast , the abundance patterns of the lighter neutron - capture elements ( @xmath19 ) are significantly different from that of the r - process component in the solar system .",
    "this observational fact is interpreted as a result of the existence of ( at least ) two distinct classes of r - process events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the search for , and subsequent detailed abundance studies of , r - process - enhanced , very metal - poor stars enable one to make estimates of the ages of these objects by use of the radioactive species that can be identified in them .",
    "the long - lived radioactive r - process elements , in particular th and u , whose half lives ( 14 gyr for @xmath20th ; 4.5 gyr for @xmath21u ) are comparable to or shorter than the cosmic age ( @xmath22 15 gyr ) , provide a powerful tool for determination of a lower limit on the age of the galaxy , and hence of the universe . if th and/or u is detected in a very metal - poor star , we can estimate the lapse of time from the era of the nucleosynthesis process that created these elements to the present .",
    "this is accomplished by measuring the present abundance ratios , either of u / th , when they are both detected ( which only applies to two stars thus far ) , or by measurement of the u or th abundance ratio as compared to stable r - process elements , such as eu , and comparing them to predictions of the initial production ratios from models ( both site - independent , e.g. , schatz et al .",
    "2002 , and site - dependent , e.g. , wanajo et al . 2002 , 2003 ; otsuki , mathews , & kajino 2003 ) .    the cosmochronometry technique ( in stars ) was pioneered by butcher ( 1987 ) , who unfortunately only had roughly solar - abundance stars to work with , hence he had to contend with the difficulties arising from complex continua and line - blending problems , which are not so severe for very metal - poor stars .",
    "one clear advantage of the cosmochronometric method is that the resulting age estimate is free from a host of uncertainties encountered by other estimates of the cosmic age , such as calibration of distance scales , detailed understanding of stellar evolution , etc .",
    "furthermore , since it is thought that the large overabundances of r - process elements are likely to have been associated with a single production event , quite likely a type ii supernova explosion in the early galaxy , one is not forced to model the entire complex history of galactic chemical evolution in order to estimate the age .",
    "the difficulties in this method , aside from the rarity of the very metal - poor stars with detectable th and u ( presently estimated to be no more than @xmath23% of giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath24@xmath25 and log@xmath26 , for elements a and b. also , the term `` metallicity '' will be assumed here to be equivalent to the stellar [ fe / h ] value . ] ; beers , private communication ) , arise from the need to accurately predict the initial production ratios , which in turn depend on having a detailed understanding of the nucleosynthesis pathways , nuclear mass models , and cross - sections for species that have not been measured adequately at present ( see schatz et al .",

    ", they assumed the initial abundance ratio between th and stable elements to be the same as that of the calculated initial solar - system abundance ratio .",
    "subsequently , westin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated the age of another r - process - enhanced metal - poor star , hd  115444 , to be 14.2 @xmath28 4 gyr from the th / eu ratio .",

    "this star , with [ fe / h ] = 2.1 , and [ eu / fe ] = + 0.9 , has the distinction of being among the most metal - rich stars in which the r - process - enhancement phenomenon has been observed .",
    "these authors , based on an average of a number of chronometer pairs involving u and th , obtained an age estimate of @xmath30 gyr .",
    "sneden et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have assembled a definitive high - s / n set of spectra for cs  22892052 , drawing on space - based and ground - based observations .",
    "their analysis has led to a revision of the th / eu age estimate for this star , to @xmath31 gyr .",
    "these results are consistent with the very recent estimate of the age of the universe by wmap ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) to within the reported errors .",
    "recently , cayrel et al . ( 2001 ) and hill et al . (",
    "2002 ) reported the detection of u , as well as th , in a high - quality vlt / uves spectrum of the extremely metal - poor star cs  31082001 , a bright [ fe / h ] = 2.9 giant discovered in the hk survey .",
    "they also found that the abundance pattern of neutron - capture elements with @xmath32 closely mimics that of the r - process component in the solar system .",
    "however , it is of interest that the situation seems to be different for nuclei near the heaviest elements .",
    "th ( @xmath33 ) and u ( @xmath34 ) show larger deviations from their expected levels , if we adopt @xmath12 gyr as the age of this object , as was estimated from the u / th ratio by @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that either cs  31082001 is peculiar in some way that has affected the surface abundances of the actinides , or that the production ratios of th and u , as compared to the stable elements ( e.g. , eu ) exhibit some real dispersion amongst very metal - poor stars .",
    "further observational work is clearly required to answer this important question .",
    "the primary purpose of this study is to obtain measurements of the abundance patterns of neutron - capture elements for very metal - poor stars , and to examine the age estimation of stars using the th / eu chronometer . in honda",
    "et al . ( 2003 ; hereafter paper i ) , we reported equivalent width measurements of absorption lines in high - quality spectra of 22 very metal - poor stars obtained with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph ( hds , * ? ? ?",
    "this sample is as large as those in previous studies by mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , ryan , norris , & beers ( 1996 ) , and johnson & bolte ( 2001 ) , and the quality of the spectra is quite high ( @xmath35 per resolution element ) in the blue region .",
    "in particular , the sample was selected to include as many objects with excesses of neutron - capture elements as possible , excluding the objects affected by the s - process , to investigate the nature of r - process nucleosynthesis in the early galaxy . in this paper , we present the abundance analyses for the neutron - capture elements , and discuss the observed abundance distributions in very metal - poor stars with excesses of r - process elements . in ",
    "2 we describe the determination of atmospheric parameters for our program stars .",
    "the abundance analysis is described in  3 , where error estimates in our derived abundances , and comparisons with previous studies , are also discussed . in ",
    "4 we discuss the patterns in the abundance ratios of neutron - capture elements produced by r - process nucleosynthesis , based on the results of our analysis . in this same section ,",
    "the abundance patterns of other elements , including the actinide th , are considered , as is the suitability of th - based chronometers for age estimates .",
    "in order to perform an abundance analysis using model stellar atmospheres , we first need to determine the atmospheric parameters , i.e. , the effective temperatures , @xmath36 , the surface gravities , @xmath37 , the microturbulent velocities , @xmath38 , and the metallicities , [ fe / h ] , for each program star , based on the available photometric data and our high - resolution spectra .",
    "these are considered in turn in the following subsections .",
    "we estimate @xmath36 from the available photometric data , employing the empirical @xmath36 scale obtained by @xcite for the @xmath39 color indices , and that by @xcite for the @xmath40 index .",
    "the broadband @xmath40 color has been frequently used for the determination of @xmath36 , because this color has been measured for the majority of the metal - poor stars discovered to date . however , the @xmath40 color of a giant star depends not only on @xmath36 , but also on metallicity and the presence , or not , of molecular absorption features , in particular those arising from carbon . hence , we give preference to the use of @xmath39 .",
    "the photometry data used for the @xmath36 determination are provided in table [ tab : photo ] .",
    "the @xmath41 data are taken from the two micron all sky survey point source catalog ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "the @xmath40 data are taken from the simbad database for bright stars , and from the list of beers et al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation ) for the fainter stars .",
    "since @xcite provides a @xmath36 scale for photometric data measured on the tcs system @xcite , the 2mass infrared photometry data are first transformed to those of the tcs system @xcite .",
    "we found that the difference between the two photometric systems is negligible for our purposes .    before applying the photometric data to the @xmath36 scale ,",
    "we first need to correct for the effects of reddening on the measured colors .",
    "schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) constructed a full - sky map of the distribution of galactic dust based on far - infrared data observed with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) and the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) instrument onboard the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite .",
    "we make use of the reddening estimates they obtained from this map .",
    "an exception is the star hd  140283 , for which a rather high value of @xmath42 was derived from the schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) map .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that this applies to the entire line of sight , which may not be appropriate for bright , nearby stars .",
    "for this star , which is only some 50 pc away , we instead adopted a reddening of @xmath43 , as estimated by ryan et al .",
    "we note that arce and goodman ( 1999 ) cautioned that the map of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) may overestimate the reddening values when the color excess @xmath44 exceeds about 0.15 mag , but the color excesses of our stars are lower than this threshold .",

    "our abundance analyses were completed before some of these photometric data became available , and we have not made a re - analysis if the difference of the @xmath36 estimated from the updated photometry and that adopted by the analysis is less than 100  k. as a result , the @xmath36 adopted in the present analysis , also given in table 3 , is sometimes slightly different ( by 80  k maximum ) from that derived based on @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath36 estimated from @xmath40 for cs  30306132 is different by more than 400  k from that obtained from @xmath39 .",
    "this object turned out to be moderately carbon - rich in our analysis , and this discrepancy should be , at least partially , due to the effect of ch molecular absorption in the b band . except for this object ,",

    "for this reason , we suggest that the discrepancy between the observed and synthetic spectra found in figure 7 ( lower panel ) of @xcite is _ not _ due to random errors in the observed spectrum , but rather arises from an overestimate of the absorption at 4019.1   in their calculation . if the absorption at this wavelength is also overestimated for hd  115444 , the contribution of the is underestimated .",

    "previous studies have shown that [ ba / fe ] drops below the solar ratio , on average ( e.g. , ryan et al . 1996 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) , at the lowest metallicities .",
    "this trend is thought to arise because of a change in the primary nucleosynthesis sources for ba between stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath99 and those with [ fe / h ] @xmath100 .",
    "ba in the more metal - rich stars is believed to originate primarily from the ( main ) s - process in low - mass or intermediate - mass stars ( 1 - 8 @xmath101 ) with a comparatively small contribution by the r - process .",
    "the production of ba at the lowest metallicities , however , is most likely due to the r - process alone , occurring in type ii supernova explosions of massive and hence rapidly - evolving stars .",
    "the contribution of the s - process to ba in the early galaxy is small , because the time - scale for the evolution of lower mass stars is long , and the ejecta from these stars contribute only to stars which formed somewhat later , with [ fe / h ] @xmath102  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "our results , shown in figure [ fig : ba ] , confirm the existence of an extremely large scatter ( a factor of @xmath221000 over the entire range ) in the ba abundances of the most metal - poor stars , even larger than reported in previous studies .",
    "for instance , the standard deviation of the [ ba / fe ] values of our sample is 0.82  dex , while that found by @xcite for 24 objects with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 is 0.59  dex .",
    "one clear reason for this larger dispersion is that the detection limit for ba lines in our work is lower than in previous programs , thanks to the high quality of the subaru / hds spectra .",
    "the other reason is likely due to our selection of candidate neutron - capture - enhanced stars , as mentioned in paper i. in spite of this selection bias , the large dispersion in ba abundances that exists in the metallicity range of @xmath103 [ fe / h ] @xmath99 , and the possibly decreased scatter at lower iron abundances , provides an important clue to the sites and mechanisms of astrophysical neutron - capture processes @xcite .",
    "roughly 95% of the eu in solar - system material is believed to be produced by the r - process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence this element is particularly suitable for investigating the characteristics of the r - process in the early galaxy .",
    "however , measurements of eu abundances in extremely metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath104 ) are still quite limited , because there is no strong eu line , unlike those of sr and ba .",
    "we have detected eu in 11 objects in our sample ; the derived [ eu / fe ] ratios for our sample are shown in figure [ fig : eu ] as a function of [ fe / h ] ( filled circles ) , along with the results obtained by previous studies ( open circles ) .",
    "our results show a large scatter also in [ eu / fe ] in very metal - poor stars , as has been reported by previous authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the dotted line indicates the value of [ ba / eu ] of the solar - system r - process component ( [ ba / eu ] @xmath105 , arlandini et al . 1999 ) , while the dashed line indicates that of the s - process component ( [ ba / eu ] @xmath106 , arlandini et al . 1999 ) . the [ ba / eu ] ratios exhibited by our stars are clearly associated with the r - process , rather than the s - process .",
    "similar results have been reported by previous authors .",
    "mcwilliam ( 1998 ) found that the mean of the [ ba / eu ] ratios for 10 stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 2.4 is 0.69 , consistent with the value expected from pure r - process nucleosynthesis within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "here we find that the ratio of [ ba / eu ] matches that of the solar - system r - process component for many stars at low metallicity .",
    "these results suggest that ba , as well as eu , is primarily produced by the r - process during the early history of the galaxy , and that ba can be used as a powerful tool to investigate the behavior of r - process elements in the early galaxy , as it remains detectable in stars of metallicities that are far lower than those in which eu is detectable .. though most of the stars shown in figure [ fig : eu ] exhibit [ eu / fe ] @xmath107 , we expect that the [ eu / fe ] values of the stars with low ba abundances are lower than zero , and in reality will , once detected , exhibit a similarly large dispersion as seen in [ ba / fe ] .",

    "the dispersion of the abundances for elements which are detected in less than 12 objects is shown by the thin bars .",
    "even though this limitation will make the dispersion of the abundances of heavy neutron - capture elements ( @xmath110 ) smaller , the dispersion of the abundances of neutron - capture elements is much larger than found for the @xmath3- and iron - peak elements .",

    "a similar scenario for sr and ba enrichment has already been proposed by previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite selected several metal - deficient stars with high and low ba abundances , and concluded that ba - poor stars show high sr / ba ratios , while the sr / ba ratios of ba - rich stars are similar to that of the r - process component in the solar system .",
    "these authors suggested the existence of two processes ( sites ) that produce sr .",
    "our interpretation for the sr and ba abundance distributions is essentially the same as theirs .",
    "however , the enrichment of sr and ba is seen much more clearly in the present study , as the result of adding new measurements and excluding stars of higher metallicity .    the enrichment of ba in the metallicity range around [ fe / h]@xmath111 is sometimes referred to as the main r - process , which produces heavy ( a @xmath133 130 ) neutron - capture elements @xcite . our interpretation for the variation of the sr and ba abundances results in the sr / ba ratio produced by this process , ( sr / ba)@xmath125 , to be about 1.5 .",
    "the absence of stars with sr / ba @xmath134 in figure [ fig : srbares ] means that ( sr / ba)@xmath125 is not significantly smaller than unity .",
    "this value is much higher than the sr / ba predicted by recent models of r - process nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , @xmath135 : otsuki , mathews , & kajino 2003 ) .",
    "the value derived by these models should be , however , a lower limit of the sr / ba ratio produced by a single site , as these models deal with only one condition which can produce heavy neutron - capture elements like ba .",
    "the yields in a real r - process site , such as a type ii supernova explosion , should be an integration of the results of a variety of conditions including the cases with low neutron - to - seed ratios , and produce light neutron - capture elements like sr .",
    "if our interpretation for the correlation between sr and ba abundances is correct , this places a quite strong constraint on the sr / ba ratio produced by the main r - process .",
    "in contrast , the nucleosynthesis process that is responsible for the production of light neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , sr ) without producing the heavier elements ( e.g. , ba ) is as yet unclear .",
    "one possibility is the existence of an independent nucleosynthesis process which dominantly produces lighter neutron - capture elements , probably prior to the main r - process which provides heavier ones ( e.g. , truran et al .",
    "for instance , the above observational results are qualitatively explained by the assumption that different mass ranges of supernovae are responsible for the light and heavy neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , qian & wasserburg 2000 ) .",
    "two different explosion mechanisms , i.e. , prompt and delayed explosion , are proposed for low - mass and high - mass supernovae , respectively , and numerical simulations of r - process nucleosynthesis have been made ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "possible r - process nucleosynthesis in neutron - star mergers may also play a role in the enrichment of the light neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand , another explanation by r - process nucleosynthesis in a single site may be possible if incomplete mixing of supernova ejecta with interstellar matter is assumed .",
    "for instance , some neutrino - heated wind models predict significantly large overproduction of light neutron - capture elements in the early phase ( @xmath136 second ) of the explosion prior to the r - process which produces the heavier elements ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "cameron ( 2001 ) suggested that r - process nucleosynthesis may take place in the jets associated with gamma - ray bursts , which would be a possible mechanism for production of an inhomogeneous r - process in a single event .",
    "stars with high sr and low ba abundances may form from the interstellar medium polluted by the ejecta enriched in light neutron - capture elements , if the ejecta is not well mixed with the matter ejected in the later phase of the r - process .",
    "an alternative explanation for the enrichment of sr without ba may be the so - called weak s - process , which proposes a neutron - capture process proposed to occur in core he - burning massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this process is expected to be unimportant in metal - deficient stars , because @xmath137ne is believed to be the neutron source . however",
    ", if this process _ can _ operate , it may contribute to light neutron - capture elements in metal - deficient stars .",
    "further systematic studies of stars with low ba abundances , especially of the abundance patterns for elements around sr , will provide important information to constrain the nucleosynthesis process responsible for their production , and their ejection dynamics as well .",
    "one important discovery in recent abundance studies of the neutron - capture elements in metal - deficient stars is that the abundance pattern of heavy neutron - capture elements are very similar , essentially an exact match , within observational errors , to that of the r - process component in the solar system . to examine details of r - process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity ,",
    "it is essential to detect as many elements as possible over the entire range of atomic numbers ( _ z _ = 31 @xmath22 92 ) .",
    "such a study is possible for very metal - poor stars with overabundances of neutron - capture elements ( [ x / fe ] @xmath138 + 0.5 ) . in such stars",
    "the absorption lines of neutron - capture elements are relatively strong , and the blending from lines of other lighter elements is comparatively weak , due to the overall low metallicity of the star .",
    "we examine the abundance pattern of neutron - capture elements in detail for the seven very metal - poor stars in which the th absorption line ( 4019  ) was detected ( see figures  [ fig : th1 ] and [ fig : th2 ] ) .",
    "all of these stars exhibit enhancements of their neutron - capture elements . among them , cs  31082001 and cs  22892052 , which have already been studied by hill et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and sneden et al . (",
    "2003 ) , are the most extreme cases , showing large enhancements of the neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , [ eu / fe]=+1.7 and + 1.5 , respectively ) .",
    "the star hd  110184 does not exhibit a remarkable enhancement of neutron - capture elements relative to iron , but our high s / n spectrum makes it possible to study th and other r - process elements in this star as well .      abundance studies of r - process - enhanced , metal - poor stars to date have shown that the abundance patterns of the neutron - capture elements with 56 @xmath6 _ z _ @xmath6 70 agree very well with that of the solar - system r - process pattern ( e.g. , sneden et al . 2003 ) . in order to investigate this phenomenon further , using our extended sample , we now compare the scaled abundance patterns of our stars with the abundance distributions in solar - system material .    for each of the seven stars with detectable r - process elements , we use the solar - system r - process abundance pattern as a template to compare the heavy - element abundances of the stars on a common scale ( figure [ fig : pattern ] ) .",
    "we scale the elemental abundances of our objects to match the solar - system abundances for elements between ba and yb ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the logarithmic values of the scaling factor ( @xmath140 ) for individual stars are listed in the columns labeled s.s .",
    "r - process in table [ tab : scale ] . for this analysis",
    ", we adopt the r - process fraction in the solar system given by burris et al .",
    "the total solar - system abundances were taken from @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : pattern ] shows that the abundance patterns of the elements with 56 @xmath5 70 for these very metal - poor stars agree very well with that of the solar - system r - process component .",
    "we also attempted to compare the abundances of our metal - poor stars with the solar - system s - process distribution in the same manner .",
    "take cs  30306132 , for example ( figure  [ fig : pattern132 ] ) . as expected from the [ ba / eu ] ratios of these objects , the agreement between the abundance patterns of our objects and the s - process pattern is poor .",
    "we also compare the abundances of our subset of metal - poor stars with r - process enhancements with the total elemental abundance distribution of the solar system ( figure [ fig : pattern132 ] ) .",
    "the logarithmic values of the scale factor are given in the column labeled s.s .",
    "total in table [ tab : scale ] .",
    "the agreement is clearly better than that in the case for the abundance pattern of the s - process component alone .",
    "this is because the r - process fraction dominates in the total solar - system abundances of elements with @xmath141 .",
    "the scaled abundances of ba , la , and ce in our stars , shown in figures [ fig : pattern ] , are less than the solar - system total abundances of these elements .",
    "presumably , this arises because the s - process contribution to the abundances of ba , la , and ce in the solar system is larger than for other elements like eu ( burris et al .",
    "2000 ) . from these comparisons ,",
    "we conclude that the abundance patterns of heavy neutron - capture elements in our objects agree best with the r - process component in the solar system .    in table",
    "[ tab : scale ] we also provide the standard deviation ( 1-@xmath72 ) of the difference between the scaled abundances of each star and the total solar - system abundances , as well as its r - process component .",
    "these standard deviations can be taken as indicators of the level of agreement between the abundance pattern of each star and the pattern of the solar - system abundances .",
    "the average of the observational errors for elements with @xmath139 ( @xmath142 ) are also provided in table 8 .",
    "comparisons of the observed 1-@xmath72 values with @xmath142 indicates good agreement between the scaled abundance pattern of our objects with that of the solar - system r - process component .",
    "we note that the 1-@xmath72 value for hd  110184 is slightly larger than those for other objects , and than its @xmath142 .",
    "one reason for this result may be that the r - process enhancement of this star ( e.g. , [ eu / fe ] = 0.06 ) is small , and a small contribution by the s - process may affect the abundance pattern of this star .    the excellent agreement between the abundance pattern of the heavy neutron - capture elements in very metal - deficient stars and that of the solar - system r - process component has already been reported for several very metal - poor stars by previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is sometimes referred to as the universality of r - process nucleosynthesis . the apparent universality is ascribed to the fact that the predicted abundance patterns of elements with @xmath139 appear to be rather insensitive to variations in the parameters of the current r - process models ( e.g. , the entropy / baryon ratio ) .",
    "the nucleosynthesis paths in this mass range ( i.e. , @xmath143 150 ) are quite similar among the r - process models that are used to predict the production of the actinide nuclei , even though the abundances of the actinides show an apparent variation in some stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned in  1 , the actinide th is heavier than the elements at the third abundance peak produced by the r - process ( os , ir , pb , etc . ) , and is a key element for the understanding of this nucleosynthesis process .",
    "application of the abundances of this element to cosmochronometry has also been discussed extensively in recent studies of very metal - deficient stars .",
    "the abundances of th measured for the seven stars in our sample are presented in figure [ fig : pattern ] . for the th abundance",
    ", the solid line here shows the _ initial _ abundance of this radioactive element , as estimated by cowan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , rather than the _ present _ th abundance , which is shown by the dashed line in this figure .",
    "since these very metal - poor stars are believed to be born in the early galaxy , the th abundances of our sample are expected to be lower than the value shown by the dashed line , if we assume that the abundance patterns of heavy neutron - capture elements , including th , produced by the r - process , is indeed universal .",
    "this is in fact found for the stars hd  110184 , hd  115444 , hd  186478 , and cs  22892052 .",
    "however , the th abundances of the other three stars are _ higher _ than would be expected from this logic .    in order to investigate this issue more clearly",
    ", we show the abundance ratios between th and the stable r - process element eu ( @xmath144(th / eu ) = @xmath122(th ) @xmath145(eu ) ) in figure [ fig : theu ] , where we plot our results , and the results of previous studies @xcite .",
    "the average and standard deviation of the values of our seven stars are @xmath146 dex and 0.17  dex , respectively .",
    "the standard deviation is as large as , or slightly larger than , the typical observation errors , which were estimated from the root - sum - square of the random errors of th and eu abundances ( error bars in figure [ fig : theu ] ) .",
    "we have found that cs  31082001 and cs  30306132 have clearly higher th / eu ratios than the well studied star cs  22892052 ( figure [ fig : theu ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : th2 ] , the observed spectra around the line are shown .",
    "the 4018.6   line exists blueward of the line .",
    "since the atmospheric parameters in these giants are quite similar , the ratio of the line strengths between and directly reflects the th / nd abundance ratio . in cs  22892052 ,",
    "the line is as strong as the line .",
    "the ratios of the line strengths in hd  6268 and hd  115444 are rather similar to that of cs  22892052 .",
    "in contrast , in cs  31082001 the line is significantly stronger than the line .",
    "in addition , in cs  30306132 , the is clearly detected , while there is no evidence for the presence of the line .",
    "these results indicate that the th / nd ratios in cs  31082001 and cs  30306132 are significantly higher than in the other three stars . as discussed in detail in subsection 4.2.1 ,",
    "nd in these objects is regarded as a product of the r - process , and can be taken as representative of the stable r - process elements . therefore , the above inspection suggests the existence of some dispersion in the abundance ratios between th and the other neutron - capture elements ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "a similar result was already reported for cs  31082001 by @xcite and @xcite , as mentioned in  1 .",
    "our present study shows that this object is not unique , but that there is at least one other similar object that shares the same `` actinide boost , '' cs  30306132 , though its enhancement factor of r - process elements is much smaller than that of cs  31082001 .",
    "we might expect that , in the near future , as additional r - process - enhanced metal - poor stars are identified , such behaviors will be seen in additional stars .",
    "if the conventional th / eu chronometer ( cowan et al , 1999 ) is simply applied to the th / eu abundance ratios , the ages of a few stars , those exhibiting actinide boosts , are estimated to be shorter than that of the present age of the sun .",
    "in particular , the derived ages of cs  31082001 and cs  30306132 are as low as zero . even with a level of uncertainty of as much as 5 gyr in the age estimation , the ages derived from the above method appear unrealistic .",
    "we note that the average of the th / eu ratios of our seven stars ( @xmath148(th / eu ) @xmath149 ) is quite similar to the value of solar - system material ( @xmath144(th / eu ) @xmath150 @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the average of the ages derived from application of the th / eu chronometer is similar to the age of the sun , and hence is also unrealistic .",
    "the observations seem to suggest that some very metal - poor stars had _ higher _ initial th abundances than expected from the solar - system r - process abundance pattern . in other words , even though the abundance pattern of the elements with @xmath139 agrees with the abundance pattern of the solar system r - process component , the initial abundance ratios of the heaviest elements , like th , to the lighter ones ( e.g. , eu ) are not necessarily the same as those expected from the r - process component in the solar system . in order to apply the abundance ratios between th and other stable elements as chronometers , estimates of the initial abundance ratios for these elements are essential",
    ", hence a deeper understanding of the r - process nucleosynthesis for wider mass ranges is necessary .",
    "one possible alternative cosmochronometer is the u / th ratio , recently applied by cayrel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hill et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the extremely r - process - enhanced , metal - poor star cs  31082001 .",
    "since @xmath20th and @xmath21u are neighboring actinide nuclei , their production rate is expected to be quite similar .",
    "this justifies the assumption that the initial abundance ratio is the same as in the initial solar - system abundance ratio , as shown by recent theoretical calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at present , u / th is expected to be the best available chronometer .",
    "we would like to point out that , even though we conclude from our analysis that there exists a real scatter in the abundance ratios between th and other neutron - capture elements with @xmath151 , the level of this scatter is at most a factor of three , much smaller than the ratios between light ( @xmath152 ) and heavy ( @xmath151 ) neutron capture elements , which are as large as a factor of 10 ( see figure [ fig : pattern ] ) .",
    "recent models of the r - process showed that the abundance ratios between the elements at the second and the third r - process peaks are quite sensitive to the parameters in the calculation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the small dispersion of th / eu ratios found in our stars , as well as in other previously studied stars , should be an important constraint on modeling the r - process , as we are beginning to place limits on the possible range over within which the initial production ratio can fall . in order to derive a clear conclusion ,",
    "it is required to systematically study the th abundances for a larger sample of very metal - poor stars , based on high s / n spectra , which would enable one to detect the th line even in stars with lower th abundances .",
    "we have conducted detailed abundance analyses for 22 very metal - poor stars based on high - resolution , high s / n near - uv - blue spectra obtained with subaru / hds .",
    "our sample of stars covers the metallicity range @xmath93 [ fe / h ] @xmath2 .",
    "this paper reports the results of abundance analyses concentrating in particular the r - process elements .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are as follows :    \\(1 ) we have identified a new highly r - process element - enhanced , metal - poor star , cs  22183031 , a giant with [ fe / h ] = @xmath7 and [ eu / fe ] = + 1.2 . the lower s / n of its spectrum , however , prevented th from being clearly detected .",
    "we also identified a new , moderately r - process - enhanced , metal - poor star , cs  30306132 , a giant with [ fe / h ] = @xmath8 and [ eu / fe ] = + 0.85 , in which th was detected .",
    "\\(2 ) we have confirmed the large star - to - star scatter in the abundances of neutron - capture elements relative to iron observed for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath24 . the abundance pattern of the heavy neutron - capture elements ( @xmath153 ) in seven r - process - enhanced , metal - poor stars are , however , quite similar to that of the r - process component in solar - system material .",
    "the ba to eu ratios in 11 metal - poor stars , including these seven objects , are nearly equal to that of the solar system r - process component .",
    "these results prove that heavy neutron - capture elements in very metal - poor stars are primarily synthesized by the r - process .",
    "\\(3 ) we have investigated the correlation between sr and ba abundances in our sample , and in other very metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) studied by previous authors , and conclude that the dispersion of the sr abundances clearly decreases with increasing ba abundance .",
    "this trend suggests the existence of two nucleosynthesis processes , one of which produces sr with very small production of ba , and the other which produces sr and ba with sr / ba @xmath154 .",
    "the so - called main r - process might be associated with the latter process , while that responsible for the former is yet unidentified .",
    "\\(4 ) the th / eu abundance ratios ( log(th / eu ) ) measured for the seven r - process - enhanced stars range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "we have confirmed the high th / eu ratio found for the extremely r - process - enhanced star cs  31082001 @xcite ; the newly discovered moderately r - process - enhanced star cs  30306 - 132 exhibits a similar ( high ) th / eu ratio as cs  31082001 .",
    "since these very metal - poor stars are believed to be formed in the early galaxy , this result means that a small dispersion appears in the abundance ratios between th and rare - earth elements , such as eu , in very metal - poor stars . in order to apply the th / eu ratios to estimates of stellar ages , further understanding of th production by r - process nucleosynthesis",

    "<S> we have obtained high - resolution , high s / n near - uv - blue spectra of 22 very metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) with subaru / hds , and measured the abundances of elements from c to th . the metallicity range of the observed stars is @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as found by previous studies , the star - to - star scatter in the measured abundances of neutron - capture elements in these stars is very large , much greater than could be assigned to observational errors , and in comparison with the relatively small scatter in the @xmath3- and iron - peak elements . in spite of the large scatter in the ratios of the neutron - capture elements relative to iron , the abundance _ </S>",
    "<S> patterns _ of heavy neutron - capture elements ( @xmath4 ) are quite similar within our sample stars . the ba / eu ratios in the 11 very metal - poor stars in our sample in which both elements have been detected are nearly equal to that of the solar system r - process component . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the abundance patterns of the heavy neutron - capture elements ( 56 @xmath5 70 ) in seven objects with clear enhancements of the neutron - capture elements are similar to that of the solar system r - process component . </S>",
    "<S> these results prove that heavy neutron - capture elements in these objects are primarily synthesized by the r - process .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the abundance ratios of the light neutron - capture elements ( 38 @xmath6 _ z _ @xmath6 46 ) relative to the heavier ones ( 56 @xmath6 _ z _ @xmath6 70 ) exhibit a large dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> our inspection of the correlation between sr and ba abundances in very metal - poor stars reveals that the dispersion of the sr abundances clearly decreases with increasing ba abundance . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is naturally explained by hypothesizing the existence of two processes , one that produces sr without ba , and another that produces sr and ba in similar proportions . </S>",
    "<S> this result should provide a strong constraint on the origin of the light neutron - capture elements at low metallicity .    </S>",
    "<S> we have identified a new highly r - process element - enhanced , metal - poor star , cs  22183031 , a giant with [ fe / h ] = @xmath7 and [ eu / fe ] = + 1.2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also identified a new , moderately r - process - enhanced , metal - poor star , cs  30306132 , a giant with [ fe / h ] = @xmath8 and [ eu / fe ] = + 0.85 .    </S>",

    "<S> the th / eu abundance ratios ( log(th / eu ) ) , are distributed over the range @xmath9 to @xmath10 , with typical errors of 0.10 to 0.15 dex . in particular , the ratios in two stars , cs  31082001 and cs  30306132 , are significantly higher than the ratio in the well - studied object cs  22892052 and those of other moderately r - process - enhanced metal - poor stars previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> since these very metal - poor stars are believed to be formed in the early galaxy , this result suggests that the abundance ratios between th and stable rare - earth elements such as eu , both of which are presumably produced by r - process nucleosynthesis , may exhibit real star - to - star scatter , with implications for ( a ) the astrophysical sites of the r - process , and ( b ) the use of th / eu as a cosmochronometer . </S>"
