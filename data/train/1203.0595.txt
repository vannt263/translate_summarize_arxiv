    "in this paper , we introduce the pa - tmsts and investigate its entanglement and nonclassicality . by using the coherent state representation of thermal state , the normally and antinormally ordering forms of the tmsts",
    "are obtained .",
    "based on this , the normalization factor of the pa - tmsts is derived , which is related to the jacobi polynomials of the squeezing parameter @xmath0 and average photon number @xmath1 of the thermal state . then we discuss the nonclassical properties by using cross - correlation function , distribution of photon number , antibunching effect and the negativity of its wf .",
    "it is found that the wf lost its gaussian property in phase space due to the presence of two - variable hermite polynomials and the wf of single pa - tmsts always has its negative region at the center of phase space .",
    "further , there are more visible negative region than the wf for the case of @xmath236 . and the negative region will be absence for the latter with the increasing @xmath1 value . the entanglement properties of the pa - tmsts by shchukin - vogel criteria and the quantum teleportation .",
    "it is shown that the photon - addtion to the tmsts can be more effective for the entanglement enhancement than the photon - subtraction from the tmsts ; and using the pa - tmsts as an entangled resource , the fidelity for teleporting a coherent state is not only dependent on the parameter @xmath0 , the average photon - number @xmath99 , but also on the photon number @xmath231 added to each mode of the tmsts . from this point , the symmetrical pa - tmsts may be more effective for quantum teleportation than the non - symmetric case .    *",
