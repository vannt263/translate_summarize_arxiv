    "as is well known ,  @xcite in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) regime the magnetic field dependences of the off - diagonal @xmath9 and diagonal @xmath10 components of the dc conductivity tensor are very different .",
    "namely , @xmath9 shows a set of plateaus with abrupt steps taking place at _ half - integer _ values of the filling factor @xmath11 .",
    "by contrast , @xmath10 is extremely small at the quantum hall plateaux and has sharp maxima at the steps between the plateaux .",
    "the conventional explanation is that , at a half - integer filling , electronic states at the fermi level are _ extended _ while at all other filling factors they are _",
    "localized_.    a powerful way to investigate two - dimensional systems , and effectively probe heterostructure parameters , is with a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) ,  @xcite especially as this is a _ non - contact _ measurement : it does not require a hall - bar to be configured and there is no need for carrier injection at the low - dimensional interface . moreover , simultaneous measurement of the attenuation and velocity of the saw provides a unique way to determine the _ complex _ ac conductivity @xmath12 as a function of magnetic field , temperature @xmath8 and saw frequency @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field dependence of @xmath14 provides information on both the extended and localized states and allows an analysis of the interplay between these states .",
    "@xcite    as we observed earlier in gaas / algaas heterostructures ,  @xcite near steps in the hall conductance , i.e. at half - integer @xmath11 , the imaginary part of the complex ac conductance @xmath15 is small while the real part @xmath16 coincides with the dc transverse conductance @xmath10 .",
    "however , in magnetic fields corresponding to regions near the center of the hall plateaux , i.e. at small integer @xmath11 , the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath10 turns out to be crucial .",
    "namely , @xmath10 is extremely small while both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are measurable quantities and @xmath18 . according to ref .",
    "these facts lead to the conclusion that the mechanism of ac conductance is _",
    "hopping_.    in the present work , for the first time , an acoustic method has been applied in a study of @xmath0-type si / si@xmath1ge@xmath2 heterostructures with the purpose of clarifying high - frequency transport mechanisms in the system . since",
    "ge and si are not piezoelectric the only way to measure acousto - electric effects in these structures is via a hybrid method : a saw propagates along the surface of piezoelectric linbo@xmath19 while the si / sige sample is gently pressed onto the linbo@xmath19 surface by means of a spring . in this case strain from the saw",
    "is not transmitted to the sample and it is only the electric field accompanying the saw that penetrates the sample and creates currents that , in turn , produce feedback to the saw . as a result , both the saw attenuation coefficient @xmath4 and velocity @xmath20 appear to depend on the properties of the two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) .    in this paper we present experimental results for saw frequencies up to 300 mhz , consider localization effects and analyze the non - linear saw interaction with the 2dhg .",
    "in our experimental arrangement , shown schematically in fig .  [ setup ] , the saw is induced by interdigital transducers at the surface of a piezoelectric linbo@xmath19 plate on top of which the sample has been placed .",
    "the samples were modulation doped si / si@xmath1ge@xmath2 heterostructures with a 2dhg sheet density @xmath21 @xmath22 and a mobility @xmath23 @xmath24/vs , measured at @xmath8=4.2 k. the layered system ( shown in fig .",

    "one interesting feature of transport properties in sige 2dhgs is the dominance of minima associated with odd filling factors for @xmath29 2 .",
    "this is because the spin splitting is comparable to the cyclotron energy , with the enhanced exchange interaction increasing the effective @xmath30-factor to 4.5 ,  @xcite and it is illustrated in the inset . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ dc ] , the minima in @xmath27 are more pronounced at @xmath11=3 and 5 than at @xmath11=4 , which only appears below 0.5 k. the dc transport measurements were made on a hall bar sample as electrical contacts were not present on the saw sample . during the experiments the samples",
    "were cooled down several times with only very small differences in conductivity on each cycle , so whilst the dc conductivity trace does not completely represent that of the sample at the time of saw investigation we believe it gives a very good indication within experimental uncertainty less than 1@xmath31 .",
    "the absorption , or attenuation , coefficient @xmath4 and relative velocity change @xmath5 of the saw that interacts with the 2dhg in the sige channel , have been simultaneously measured at temperatures @xmath8=0.7 - 1.6 k in perpendicular magnetic fields up to 7 t. fig .",
    "[ gamvel ] illustrates the field dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a frequency of 30mhz at 0.7 k together with the magnetoresistance components .",
    "one can see that the absorption coefficient and the velocity change both undergo shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) type oscillations in magnetic field , with maxima corresponding to @xmath27 minima and the centers of the iqhe plateaus in @xmath28 , thus allowing the hole density in the 2d - channel to be determined directly from acoustic measurements .",
    "one exception is the maximum of the attenuation coefficient in the vicinity of @xmath11=2 , which splits to reveal a minimum in @xmath4 at exactly @xmath11=2 where the velocity shift is at its largest .",

    "we can ignore the small difference of 4 @xmath31 in dielectric constant between si and si@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath47=70 nm denotes the finite distance between the sample surface and the 2dhg layer and @xmath48 is the vacuum clearance between the sample surface and the linbo@xmath19 surface .",
    "this clearance remains finite , despite the heterostructure being pressed to the piezoelectric platelet , because of some roughness of both surfaces .",
    "since the actual clearance is not well controlled , the quantity @xmath48 is treated as an adjustable parameter .",
    "it is determined by fitting the experimental data at those magnetic fields where the conductance is metallic and essentially frequency independent . in the present experiments the clearance @xmath48 ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 @xmath49.@xcite    measurements and analysis of the high - frequency conductivity will be considered in two regimes : ( a ) where the response is linear in applied saw power and ( b ) the nonlinear region , when acoustic effects begin to depend on the intensity of the sound wave .",

    "[ g ] and [ v ] , together with the dc - conductivity , derived from magnetoresistance measurements via @xmath52 , all at @xmath8=0.7k .",
    "one can see that @xmath50 demonstrates sdh - type oscillations and , in the same way as @xmath53 , is dominated by features at odd filling factors - the only minimum at even occupancy is observed at @xmath11=2 .",
    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ s12 ] that @xmath50 is equal to the static conductivity @xmath10 in the low magnetic field region ( below 2 t ) and near half - integer filling factors where the electron states are _",

    "[ s12 ] also shows that whilst @xmath51 is very small near half - integer filling factors and at low magnetic fields , it has appreciable magnitude near to @xmath11=2 and 3 .",
    "it is actually double @xmath50 at @xmath11=2 , which , along with the fact that @xmath54 , points to a manifestation of two - dimensional high - frequency hopping conductivity .",
    "it is known that in the iqhe regime carriers can be localized in the random potential generated by charged impurities , with the result that the dc conductivity vanishes and the high - frequency conductivity has to be via _",
    "hopping_. according to ref .",
    ", when the 2d high - frequency conductivity has a hopping character , and is determined by hole hops between states close in energy but localized at two different impurity centers ( that form _ pair complexes _ which do not overlap ) , @xmath55 and @xmath10=0 .",
    "the features we observe at small @xmath11 thus provide evidence that hole hopping begins to make an important contribution to the high - frequency conductivity . however",
    ", this would appear not to be the case at lower magnetic fields where @xmath56 and @xmath51 vanishes .",
    "in fact at @xmath11=3 @xmath57 so even here hopping is not the major high frequency conduction mechanism .    in ref",
    ".   it has been shown that for total localization the ratio @xmath58 will have the form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , with @xmath61 of the order of the bohr energy , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a numerical factor depending on the density of states in the region between the landau levels .",
    "an estimation of @xmath65 valid for the deformation phonon relaxation mechanism is given in ref .",
    "as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the deformation potential , @xmath68 is the mass density , @xmath69 is the longitudinal sound velocity .",
    "using this estimation one concludes that in the hopping regime @xmath70 5 , whereas experimentally we observe @xmath70 2 in the middle of the @xmath11=2 hall plateau .",
    "this experimental result suggests that the high frequency conductivity has a _ mixed _ mechanism consisting of two contributions : the first we assign to the extended states",
    ", while the second , hopping , is associated with the localized states . for @xmath11=3 , at the lower magnetic field of 2.9 t , the hopping contribution becomes even smaller , and at 1.7 t ( @xmath11=5 ) it is completely absent .",
    "[ gamfreq ] illustrates the effect on the absorption coefficient @xmath4 of varying the saw frequency at the temperature @xmath71 1 k. at this temperature the velocity change @xmath72 is small and does not exceed 3@xmath7310@xmath74 at @xmath11=2 .",
    "although there are large changes in the magnitude of @xmath4 , these are completely accounted for by the explicitly frequency - dependent factors of equation 1 .",
    "therefore , within our experimental error , we find no frequency dependence of the acoustically measured conductivity @xmath14 at @xmath71 1 k. it is somewhat surprising to see no effect of frequency in the region of @xmath11=2 where a significant hopping contribution was found at 0.7 k , but we must conclude that the increase in temperature has reduced the relative importance of hopping .",
    "hence , one can see that the acoustic measurements allow an analysis of the @xmath6 to @xmath7 ratio and , thus , the degree of carrier localization can be followed as a function of temperature and magnetic field .      to investigate non - equilibrium effects",
    "we have measured the dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 on the saw intensity at 30 mhz , by varying the saw - source power over the range 0.002 - 11 mw at @xmath8=0.7k . from these measurements",
    "@xmath50 has been extracted and is shown in fig .",
    "[ s1hpt]a for the range of rf - source powers .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath50 increases at higher saw power and we find that the condition @xmath75 is satisfied in this non - linear regime .",
    "we interpret this to mean that the high - frequency conductivity is mainly from delocalized holes .",
    "these results should be compared with the magnetic field dependence of @xmath50 extracted from measurements at different temperatures , and sufficiently low power ( @xmath76 w ) to remain in the linear regime , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ s1hpt]b . for a quantitative comparison , values of @xmath50",
    "have been taken from fig .",
    "[ s1hpt ] at magnetic fields of 2.9 t and 4.3 t , corresponding to @xmath11=3 and @xmath11=2 respectively , and plotted in fig .",
    "[ s1pt ] as a function of ( a ) rf - source power @xmath77 and ( b ) temperature .",
    "one can see from these plots that @xmath50 shows similar increases with temperature and saw power leading to the conclusion that the observed nonlinear effects are probably associated with carrier heating in the saw electric field .",
    "there have been a number results published on hole heating by a steady electric field in the 2dhg of si / sige heterostructures .",
    "@xcite however , it is valuable to investigate the energy - loss mechanisms in these structures using a contactless method ( such as possible here using acoustics ) that excludes carrier injection to the low - dimensional interface from contact areas .",
    "hole heating may be described by means of a carrier temperature @xmath78 , greater than the lattice temperature @xmath8 .",
    "( the propriety of introducing this carrier temperature will be discussed below ) . from fig .",
    "[ s1pt ] @xmath78 can be determined by comparing the variation of @xmath50 on saw power @xmath77 with the curves of @xmath50 versus the lattice temperature @xmath8 , in a manner analogous to sdh thermometry .",
    "@xcite such a comparison makes it possible to establish a correspondence between the temperature of the 2dhg and the rf - source power .    to characterize the energy relaxation mechanisms one needs to extract the absolute energy loss rate @xmath79 resulting from the saw interaction with the carriers . since",
    "only delocalized states are being considered and @xmath51=0 we can use the result of ref .   that the energy loss rate is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the saw electric field ,    @xmath82}w,\\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath83 is the input saw power scaled to the width of the sound track .",
    "the resulting energy losses rate per hole @xmath84 are shown as a function of @xmath78 in fig .  [ qt ] .    from numerous works on dc heating",
    "@xcite a consensus appears that the energy relaxation of holes in si / sige 2dhgs is due to acoustic phonon deformation potential scattering . however , the authors disagree over whether a screened or unscreened deformation potential should be used .",
    "the functional form @xmath85 , corresponds to energy relaxation via carrier scattering from the deformation potential of the acoustic phonons with either weak screening ( @xmath86=5 ) or strong screening ( @xmath86=7 ) and the slope of inset of fig .",
    "[ qt ] is either : @xcite @xmath87 or : @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89=0.24@xmath90 is the effective mass for si@xmath1ge@xmath2 @xcite and @xmath91 @xmath92 is the screening wavevector for @xmath0-type sige .",
    "a least - squares analysis showed that the experimental curves of fig .",
    "[ qt ] could be fitted by the functional form @xmath93 , but given the small temperature range of the data the form @xmath94 is equally applicable . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ qt ] , @xmath95 is plotted against @xmath96 for both @xmath86=5 and 7 revealing a linear dependence in each case . according to ref .",
    ", screening of the hole - phonon interaction can be neglected if the screening wavevector @xmath97 exceeds the wavevector @xmath98 of phonons with the average thermal energy , which in our case is @xmath98=8.2@xmath7310@xmath99 @xmath92 .",
    "thus , @xmath100 and the energy relaxation here is dominated unambiguously by _ unscreened _ acoustic phonon scattering so we should use @xmath86=5 .",
    "this is in agreement with previous work on pseuodomorphic si@xmath101ge@xmath102 heterostructures with x=0.2 @xcite and x=0.15 @xcite , where weak screening was found to be appropriate for a wide range of hole density up to at least 10@xmath103 @xmath22 . from the expression for @xmath104 ,",
    "the value of the deformation potential can be determined as @xmath67=5.3@xmath1050.3 ev .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the deformation potential estimate of 5.5@xmath1050.5 ev obtained in ref .",
    "for the same sige heterostructure from phonon - drag thermopower measurements and , although not agreeing , is of similar magnitude to the values of 3@xmath1050.4 ev and 2.7@xmath1050.3 ev reported in refs . and respectively",
    "for the first time , the _ contactless _ acoustic method has been applied to strained @xmath0-type si / sige heterostructures .",
    "simultaneous measurements of the attenuation and velocity shift of a surface acoustic wave were conducted and used to obtain the high frequency conductivity and its dependence on magnetic field , temperature and saw power .",
    "the following conclusions may be drawn from our experimental results and analysis :    in the integer quantum hall effect regime , the degree of the carrier localization can be followed as a function of magnetic field and/or temperature from the high frequency conductivity .",
    "it is found that even at @xmath8=0.7 k close to the center of the @xmath11=2 hall plateau , only some fraction of the holes in the 2d - channel appear to be localized .",
    "thus , the mechanism responsible for the high frequency conductivity appears to be a mixture of two terms and is determined both by the extended states as well as hopping via localized states .    in studying non - linear effects , heating of the 2dhg in si / sige heterostructures by the saw electric field",
    "is observed .",
    "this heating could be described by a carrier temperature @xmath106 . from the experimental dependence of the energy loss rate on @xmath78 , we find that the hole energy relaxation time @xmath107 is determined by dissipation in the unscreened acoustic phonon deformation potential and have obtained values for @xmath107 as well as the deformation potential .",
    "the work was supported by rffi 04 - 02 - 16246 , nato - clg 979355 , grant of the president of the rf ns-2200.2003.2 , prg .",
    "minnauki `` spintronika '' and intas-01 - 0184 .",
    "the condition for introducing a carrier temperature @xmath106 is that relaxation processes within the carrier gas must be much faster than those leading to thermalization of the carriers i.e.      where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath107 are the momentum , carrier - carrier , and energy relaxation times , respectively .",
    "the momentum relaxation time can be found from the transport mobility as @xmath111 and is clearly shorter than the carrier - carrier interaction time given by @xcite @xmath112    finally , we can estimate the energy relaxation time @xmath107 from our acoustic measurements .",
    "indeed , if the 2d gas can be characterized by a carrier temperature @xmath78 and heating is weak @xmath113 , the energy loss rate per hole can be written in the form",
