    "excitation energy transfer ( eet ) phenomena between molecules by exchange of a virtual photon play an important role in science and technology , such as photosynthesis and bio - sensors .",
    "eet occurs as follows ; a molecule ( donor ) makes the transition from an excited state to a lower energy state and a neighboring molecule ( acceptor ) is excited to higher energy state by exchange of a virtual photon .",
    "the transfer time between the two molecules away a few nanometers is less than a few picoseconds .",
    "conventionally , the static coulomb potential between the two molecules is used with fermi s golden rule@xcite for the calculation of eet.@xcite however , this standard theory fails to explain the extremely high efficiency of eet in the photosynthesis system , such as the light - harvesting complex of purple bacteria .",
    "many approaches to this problem have been proposed until now , but the problem is still to be solved.@xcite we investigate a new possibility to solve this problem by taking into account a finite size effect of the time interval@xcite during the virtual photon is exchanged in eet .",
    "this finite size effect is caused by the non - stationary effect of the virtual photon , which is not included in the standard theory using the static coulomb potential .",
    "exchange of the virtual photon between electrons leads to the dipole - dipole potential in the point - particle limit in a short - range region .",
    "the dipole - dipole potential that comes from the direct coulomb term leads to frster mechanism@xcite in the standard theory .",
    "the standard theory is very useful for estimation of the resonance energy transfer .",
    "in contrast to that , the finite size corrections obtained in the present paper appear outside the resonance energy region .",
    "thus , the correction term is totally different from the resonance energy transfer obtained in the standard theory .",
    "we study the dependence of the transition amplitude on the molecule size and the time interval explicitly .",
    "if the time interval is finite , then the finite size effect generally appears in a transition probability through the regions where the wave nature of quanta remains.@xcite when the finite time interval is shorter than a typical time that is estimated in the present paper , the correction to the transition probability becomes even larger than the standard one calculated by the fermi s golden rule .",
    "these finite size corrections have been mostly overlooked until recently .",
    "it is important that the correction considered here is not the higher - order loop diagram but the tree diagram contribution in which on - shell virtual photon states are dominant .",
    "therefore , the finite size effect could result in a large correction to the transition probability .    in this paper",
    ", we study a simple model in which eet is caused by exchange of a virtual massless scalar particle and electron wave functions in molecules are assumed to be one - particle states and gaussian function .",
    "we also assume that a donor electron and acceptor electron are well separated and regarded as distinct two particles . in this massless scalar interaction model , eet",
    "is calculated for a finite time interval and compared with the standard theory . as a result , in addition to the resonance peak due to fermi s golden rule , finite size corrections appear outside the resonance energy region .",
    "these corrections increase the transition probability , and therefore , the transfer time is shortened and the efficiency of eet could increase . while the resonance peak increases with the time interval , this correction to the transition probability is hardly dependent on the time interval .",
    "thus , the correction becomes even larger than the resonance peak contribution for a short time interval .",
    "the resonance peak is hardly dependent on the molecular size except for dipole moment dependence . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite size correction is strongly dependent on the molecular size .",
    "such behavior is consistent with the previously computed results in high - energy phenomena.@xcite it is shown that the finite size correction could reduce the eet time considerably in a photosynthesis system .    in this paper",
    ", we use the natural unit ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "in this section , we review a basic concept in quantum mechanics underlying our theory . we consider a hamiltonian that is decomposed into a free hamiltonian @xmath1 and an interaction hamiltonian @xmath2 as @xmath3 we assume that @xmath1 does not change a number of particles but @xmath2 does .",
    "for example , @xmath2 creates or annihilates a massless particle .",
    "let us introduce energy eigenstates of the free hamiltonian as @xmath4 we assume that energy eigenstates are also particle number eigenstates .",
    "then , we have the following relation as @xmath5 time evolution of the quantum state is governed by schrdinger s wave equation , @xmath6 we consider a non - stationary wave function that is expanded by energy eigenstates as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the initial state and @xmath9 is the transition amplitude for the final state @xmath10 .",

    "( [ expect ] ) .",
    "the second term is the expectation value of the energy increase for @xmath1 at @xmath11 and corresponds to finite size corrections to fermi s golden rule .",
    "the third term is the expectation value of @xmath2 , which is the overlap of different final states through @xmath2 and corresponds to the interference term due to diffraction .",
