    "apart from these physical applications , there have been studies from an abstract point of view @xcite and also from a mathematical physics perspective .",

    "in the present work we have studied various aspects of cs constructed for compact as well as as noncompact nonlinear algebras . specifically , we have calculated the photon number distribution , mean photon number , intensity correlation , mandel parameter and the metric factor .",
    "we have also shown that the nonlinear @xmath1 pcs and the bgcs are related via laplace transform .",
    "it has been clearly shown from the plots that the @xmath0 , nonlinear @xmath0 pcs , as well as @xmath1 , nonlinear @xmath1 bgcs , and nonlinear @xmath1 pcs have sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "only the @xmath1 pcs has a super - poissonian statistics .",
    "we have also studied the metric factor associated with the linear as well as the nonlinear cs .",
    "but an in depth analytical study is needed . in the present work",
    "have just given a qualitative feel for the geometrical structure via the metric factor .",
    "the berry s phase corresponding to all the three different cs has been obtained",
    ". it will be nice to give a geometrical interpretation for the phases .",
    "the primary difficulty one faces in the study of metrics and the geometrical underpinning of berry s phase , is the absence of a group structure for the nonlinear algebras .",
    "this in turn translates into the problem of existence of a proper exponential map .",
    "an interesting spin - off of the present study is the following .",
    "the nonlinear cs that have been used in the present work can be viewed as special cases of cs @xmath73 whose normalisation constant is given by @xmath74 .",
    "these cs were constructed in @xcite , motivated by @xcite , as arising from the stieltjes and hausdorff moment problems .",
    "now , one can try to see if these states have any underlying nonlinear algebraic structure .",
    "furthermore one can study the geometrical structure of the cs constructed in @xcite .",
    "also the berry phase can be calculated for the same .    as future work",
    "one can repeat all the calculations presented in this work for other non - linear algebras .",
    "the non - linear algebra that we have in mind is the quadratic one .",
    "this might be easy since the cs have already been constructed .",
    "another interesting algebra that one can consider is the delbeq - quesne ( dq ) algebra @xcite .",
    "let @xmath75 be the generators .",
    "the dq algebra is then defined by the following commutation relations : [ x_+ , x_- ] = p(x_0 )  , = g(x_0 ) x_+  , = - x_-  g(x_0 ) . here",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 are polynomials of the diagonal operator , @xmath78 . to the best of our knowledge",
