    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach to quantum hadrodynamics @xcite has become a very useful tool for describing ground - state properties of nuclei along the periodic table .",
    "the simplest model , the linear @xmath0 model of walecka @xcite , describes the nuclear force in terms of the exchange of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "it is known that the value of the nuclear matter incompressibility is unreasonably high in this linear model ( @xmath3 mev ) , which is a serious drawback for a precise description of some properties of finite nuclei and of collective excitations such as the breathing mode ( isoscalar giant monopole resonance ) .",
    "the problem can be cured by introducing cubic and quartic self - interactions of the @xmath1 meson @xcite , which in particular have the effect of lowering the incompressibility , and the model can be refined by adding an isovector @xmath4 meson .",
    "current non - linear parameter sets , such as the nl3 parametrization @xcite , give ground - state binding energies and densities in very good agreement with the experimental data , not only for magic nuclei but also for deformed nuclei as well as for nuclei far from the stability line .",
    "the rmf model has also been applied to describe dynamical collective motions in nuclei .",
    "the basic theory of vibrational states in nuclei , the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , has been generalized to the relativistic domain ( rrpa ) @xcite and it has been used in calculations of isoscalar giant resonances , to obtain response functions and mean energies for several magic nuclei .",
    "small - amplitude collective motions such as the isovector dipole oscillation and the isoscalar and isovector quadrupole oscillations @xcite , as well as the isoscalar and isovector monopole oscillations @xcite , have been studied in the time - dependent rmf approach .",
    "another approach is based on constrained rmf calculations .",
    "it has been applied to obtain breathing - mode energies and incompressibilities in the linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite @xmath0 models .",
    "the generator coordinate method , with generating functions that are solutions of constrained rmf calculations , has been employed to compute excitation energies and transition densities of giant monopole states @xcite .",
    "other calculations of breathing - mode energies in the relativistic framework , see refs.@xcite , have relied on the scaling model in combination with the leptodermous expansion of the finite nucleus incompressibility derived by blaizot @xcite .    in the non - relativistic framework",
    "it is well established that the rpa is the small amplitude limit of the time - dependent hartree ",
    "fock approach @xcite . in the relativistic case",
    "the rpa configuration space must include negative energy states from the dirac sea in order to reproduce the results of time - dependent rmf or constrained rmf calculations @xcite . paraphrasing the statement",
    ", the rrpa corresponds to the small amplitude limit of the time - dependent rmf theory in the no - sea approximation when the rrpa includes both positive energy particle - hole pairs , and pairs formed from the empty dirac sea states and the occupied fermi sea states .",
    "semiclassical methods in nuclear physics , like the thomas  fermi theory , have proven to be very helpful for dealing with nuclear properties of global character that vary smoothly with the particle number @xmath5 ( e.g. , binding energies , densities and their moments ) @xcite .",
    "the success of these methods stems from the fact that the shell corrections ( quantal effects ) are small as compared to the smooth part given by the semiclassical calculation .",
    "semiclassical techniques like nuclear fluid dynamics @xcite and the extended thomas  fermi method @xcite have been applied to study giant resonances in non - relativistic models . in the relativistic context , the nuclear fluid dynamics approach has been utilized , e.g. , in refs.@xcite .",

    "@xcite resorted to a local lorentz boost and the scaling method to study isoscalar giant monopole and quadrupole states in the linear @xmath0 model .",
    "the investigations were carried out for nuclear matter ( where a thomas  fermi approximation is exact ) @xcite and for symmetric , uncharged finite nuclei @xcite whose densities were solved in the relativistic thomas  fermi ( rtf ) approximation .",
    "the relativistic extended thomas  fermi ( retf ) method @xcite is a refinement of the rtf method , which incorporates gradient corrections of order @xmath6 to the pure rtf approximation .",
    "it was derived only a few years ago and it has since been applied in calculations of ground - state binding energies and radii of finite nuclei @xcite and in investigations of nuclear surface properties @xcite . in the present work we shall use the rtf and retf approaches to calculate the excitation energies of the isoscalar giant monopole and quadrupole resonances in spherical nuclei .",
    "this will be done by means of the scaling method , within the framework of the non - linear @xmath0 model and the rmf theory .",
    "we shall also perform constrained calculations for the monopole state .",
    "recently , the basic theory derived in the rtf approach has been applied to discuss the virial theorem and to study the breathing - mode energy within the rmf theory @xcite . in the present contribution",
    "we analyze our self - consistent method in depth . to our knowledge , for realistic non - linear parameter sets of the rmf theory , these are the first calculations of isoscalar giant resonances in finite nuclei carried out with the scaling method which are fully self - consistent ( i.e. , we do not make use of a leptodermous expansion as in previous scaling approaches @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the meson - exchange nature of the relativistic model one has to deal with finite range forces , which renders the scaling method more involved than , e.g. , for non - relativistic zero - range skyrme forces .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the non - relativistic situation , there exist two different densities , namely the baryon and the scalar density , in accordance with the fact that one has two types of fields , the vector and the scalar field .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "after the introductory remarks , we collect the basic expressions of the energy density and the variational equations of the rtf and retf models in section 2 .",
    "the third and fourth sections are devoted to the derivation of the equations and the discussion of the numerical applications for the giant monopole and quadrupole resonances , respectively .",
