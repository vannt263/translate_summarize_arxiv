    "max - stable process models for spatial data may be constructed using the spectral representation of @xcite .",
    "max - stable processes built from this representation were first used for spatial analysis by @xcite . since then , a handful of subsequent spatial max - stable process models have been proposed , notably that of @xcite and @xcite , who proposed a more general construction that includes several other known models as special cases .",
    "applications of spatial max - stable processes include @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    because closed - form expressions for the likelihoods associated with spatial max - stable processes are not available , parameter estimation and inference is problematic . taking advantage of the availability of bivariate densities , @xcite suggest maximum pairwise likelihood estimation and asymptotic inference based on a sandwich matrix ( composed of expected derivatives of the composite likelihood function ) to properly account for using a pairwise likelihood when computing standard errors [ @xcite ] .",
    "recently , @xcite extend this approach using composite likelihood based on trivariate densities .",
    "the problem of spatial prediction , conditional on observations , for max - stable random fields ( analogous to kriging for gaussian processes ) has also proven difficult .",
    "the recent conditional sampling algorithm of @xcite is capable of producing both predictions and prediction standard errors for most spatial max - stable models of practical interest , subject to discretization errors that can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "bayesian estimation and inference for max - stable process models for spatial data on a continuous domain has been elusive . implementing these models in a fully - bayesian framework",
    "has several advantages , including incorporation of prior information and natural uncertainty assessment for model parameters and predictions .",
    "approximate bayesian methods based on asymptotic properties of the pairwise likelihood function are possible .",
    "@xcite use an estimated sandwich matrix to adjust the metropolis ratio within an mcmc sampler , while @xcite rotates and scales the mcmc sample post - hoc and @xcite use pairwise likelihoods without adjustment .",
    "bayesian models that are not based on max stable processes have been used for analysis of extreme values with spatial structure .",
    "@xcite uses a hierarchical model with a conditionally - independent generalized pareto likelihood , incorporating all spatial dependence through gaussian process priors on the generalized pareto likelihood parameters .",
    "spatial dependence has also been achieved through bayesian gaussian copula models [ @xcite ] and through a more flexible copula based on a dirichlet process construction [ @xcite ] .",
    "we develop a new hierarchical bayesian model for analyzing max - stable processes .",

    "positive stable random effects have been used to model multivariate extremes with finite dimensions [ @xcite ] .",
    "we extend this approach to accommodate data on a continuous spatial domain .",
    "we show that the resulting model is max - stable marginally over the random effects , and that a limiting case of this construction provides a finite - dimensional approximation to the well - known gaussian extreme value process ( gevp ) of @xcite , often referred to as the `` smith process . ''",
    "lower - dimensional representations have previously been proposed for high - dimensional extremes in various settings [ @xcite ] .",
    "our construction permits analysis of the joint distribution of all observations , and thus can produce straightforward predictions at unobserved locations . because we use a hierarchical model to represent the spatial max - stable process , a bayesian implementation is a natural choice .",
    "this allows us to model underlying marginal structures as flexibly as we like , in addition to automatic pooling of information and uncertainty propagation . also , the proposed framework permits representing the the spatial process using a lower - dimensional representation , which leads to efficient computing for large spatial data sets .    the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows .",

    "therefore , the posterior mean of @xmath199 can be interpreted as the posterior probability that the @xmath200th gev parameter varies spatially , which can be used to approximate the bayes factor comparing these models . in the separate mixture",
    "prior fit , the posterior probability that the gev parameters vary spatially was at least 0.99 for all three parameters .",
    "we also aim to quantify changes in extreme quantiles .",

    "the large location and scale parameters lead to large medians in the southeast , while the 0.95 quantile is the largest in florida due to the large shape parameter .",
    "the difference between the historical and future scenarios is summarized in figures  [ fgevchange ] and  [ fquantchange ] .",
    "the estimated gev location and log scale parameters are larger for the future scenario for the majority of the spatial domain .",
    "the increase is the largest in alabama , georgia , and new england .",
    "the shape parameter also shows an increase in alabama , but statistically significant decrease in florida .",
    "figure  [ fquantchange](c ) shows that these changes in gev parameters lead to an increase in the 0.95 quantile for most of the spatial domain . with the exception of the midwest and southern florida ,",
    "the posterior probability of an increase in the 0.95 quantile is near one [ figure  [ fquantchange](d ) ] , indicating that extremes have a different spatial pattern in the future scenario .",
    "parameter estimates provide evidence of residual dependence : the posterior mean ( standard deviation ) of @xmath46 is 0.483 ( 0.008 ) and the posterior mean of the spatial range @xmath90 is 41.6 ( 0.4 ) kilometers .",
    "to illustrate the effects of failing to account for residual spatial dependence , we compare these results with the model that ignores spatial dependence in the residuals , that is , sets @xmath52 .",
    "one effect of accounting for residual dependence is an increase in posterior variance for the gev parameters .",
    "figure  [ fvarratio ] shows that the posterior variance often doubles as a result of including residual dependence . therefore ,",
    "while spatial modeling of the gev parameters reduces uncertainty by borrowing strength across space compared to analyzing all sites completely separately , it appears that spatial modeling of the gev parameters without accounting for residual dependence underestimates uncertainty.=1",
    "in this paper we propose a new modeling approach for spatial max - stable processes .",
    "the proposed model is closely related to the gevp and permits a bayesian analysis via mcmc methods . applied to the climate data , we find statistically significant increases under the future climate scenario in the upper quantiles of precipitation for most of the spatial domain , with the largest increase in the southeast .",
    "the proposed hierarchical model opens the door for several exciting research directions .",
    "the model could be made even more flexible by changing the form of the kernels .",
    "it should be possible to replace the gaussian kernel with any other kernel that integrates to one , that is , any other two - dimensional density function . for large data sets",
    ", it may even be possible to estimate the kernel function nonparametrically from the data .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use bayesian nonparametrics to estimate the spatial covariance function of a gaussian process .",
    "this approach could be extended to the extreme data , using , say , a dirichlet process mixture prior for the kernel function .",
    "the methods proposed in this paper could also be extended to more complicated dependency structures .",
