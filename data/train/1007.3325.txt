    "more than two decades after the discovery of the cuprates @xcite , the theoretical description of this phenomenon still represents a challenge for the physicists .",
    "the fundamental aspects of the cuprates phase diagram can be described in the following terms . in the overdoped regime",
    ", there is a conventional normal metal , while in the very low underdoped , it is displayed an antiferromagnetic insulator ( afi ) phase . between these limits",
    ", there is the onset of a superconducting ( sc ) phase .",
    "nevertheless , it is the so - called pseudogap metal @xcite above the sc and close to the afi phase which attracts much of the interest .",
    "it is widely believed that the understanding of such region is the key element to reveal the nature of the cuprates .",
    "the pseudogap phase is characterized by a density of states with low intensity near the fermi level leading to an anomalous fermi surface which is subject of intensive investigations . in the experimental field , while the fermi surface determined by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is formed by disconnected fermi arcs @xcite , the quantum - oscillation experiments detect hole - pockets enclosing the antinodal points @xcite . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", some general arguments have been proposed to explain the origin of the pseudogap .",
    "the first one relates it to a preformation of electron pairs @xcite . in the second one",
    ", the pseudogap phase is originated from a hidden broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , there is also a proposition which suggests that the presence of short - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations could be the mechanism responsible for the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "for instance , a recent work @xcite has indicated that antiferromagnetic fluctuations with short correlation length could play a fundamental role in order to understand the apparent disagreement between arpes and quantum - oscillation experiments .",
    "therefore , one can set the question how that contributions coming from the antiferromagnetic correlations , could give rise to the pseudogap and consequently , the anomalies on the fermi surface ( fs ) .    among the available many body techniques",
    ", the n - pole approximation @xcite seems to be quite suitable to such a purpose ( see also discussion in reference @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the poles of the one particle green s function presents an energy shift ( or band shift ) in the self energy composed basically by three terms , one of them is the correlation function @xmath7 , which can produce af correlations .",
    "actually , recent works have investigated the role of af correlations using the composite operator method ( com)@xcite which is an analytical technique that allows calculating all correlations functions involved in the problem , fully self - consistent . as main result",
    ", it is obtained that af correlations can be , indeed , a source of a pseudogap .",
    "it should be stressed that the previous results have been obtained for the one - band hubbard model .",
    "one remaining issue is related to the role of hybridization on the af correlations .",
    "a recent experimental work @xcite , using the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) technique , has evidenced that the hybridization ( between the @xmath8-orbitals of the cooper @xmath9 and the @xmath10-orbitals of the oxygen @xmath11 ) in cuprates systems is stronger than that one expected from tight - binding theory .",
    "however , the one - band models neglect the presence of the oxygen sites . due to the strong correlations at the @xmath9-sites , the oxygen sites may be occupied by holes when the system is doped @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the one - band models are able to capture many of the most important physical properties of cuprates , probably , a model which can incorporate additional details such as the hybridization would be a more adequate description of the cuprates .    in the present work ,",
    "an extended @xmath1 hubbard model is treated by a n - pole approximation @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can investigate how af correlations could affect the properties of the model , mainly focusing on theirs role as a possible source of a pseudogap and anomalous fs .",
    "it should be remarked that in the extended @xmath1 hubbard model used in the present work the model parameters which can affect af correlations are not only the doping @xmath12 and the strength of local coulomb interaction @xmath13 , but also the hybridization .",
    "consequently , it would be possible to produce a systematic investigation of how the variation of these model parameters as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and , particularly , the hybridization , can affect the af correlations and how such correlations influence the features of physical quantities such as the spectral function @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , the extended @xmath1 hubbard model has been previously studied within the n - pole approximation @xcite , in which @xmath15-wave superconductivity has been treated following the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been obtained that the increase of hybridization suppresses the superconductivity .",
    "this occurs mainly due to the fact that the hybridization has strong effects in the band shift which moves the superconducting gap to low energies breaking the gap symmetry relative to the zero energy .",
    "furthermore , the hybridization broadens and suppresses the density of states becoming unfavored the pair formation ( near the fermi energy ) .",
    "it is important to mention that in the present work , the @xmath1 model includes hoppings to the second - nearest - neighbors which improves significantly the uncorrelated band structure considered here .",
    "it is well known from earlier results @xcite that in the normal state the function @xmath16 is strongly dependent on the doping and the coulomb interaction , particularly , on the underdoped regime .",
    "moreover , it has also been verified that the correlation function @xmath17 , which behaves like @xmath16 , is also strongly dependent on the @xmath1 hybridization @xmath18 @xcite . however , for a given doping @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath19 produce effects in opposite direction , i.e. , while @xmath13 increases the intensity of @xmath16 , @xmath18 decreases it . the fact that @xmath18 depletes the correlation function @xmath16 and consequently the antiferromagnetic correlations makes the hybridization an adequate physical mechanism to verify whether the af correlations are or are not essential to the onset of the pseudogap .",
    "it is important to highlight that , in the present scenario , the af correlations are deeply influenced by the momentum structure of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , there is a considerable number of works treating about this important subject .",
    "for instance , in references @xcite the behavior of the af correlations associated to @xmath16 were studied by using monte carlo simulations . however",
    ", the projection techniques @xcite and methods like slave - boson @xcite and exact diagonalization @xcite have also been considered .",
    "actually , quite recent results @xcite obtained within the composite operator method ( com ) , which is an analytical and fully self - consistent method , have shown that the momentum dependence of the charge and spin correlation functions is very important to obtain anomalies like the pseudogap in the underdoped regime of the hole - doped case .",
    "nevertheless , in the original roth s procedure @xcite and in the subsequent works in which the roth s n - pole approximation is used , it was considered @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the hopping between nearest - neighbors ) for the @xmath22 nearest - neighbors .",
    "consequently , several correlation functions present in the band shift ( including @xmath16 ) are constant over all the first brillouin zone . however , such a simplification is unable to capture properly the @xmath2-dependence of the band shift @xmath23 , mainly , in the underdoped regime .",
    "thus , in the present work , the band shift and , therefore , the @xmath16 have been evaluated including adequately such @xmath2-dependence .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the model and the general formalism of the roth s n - pole approximation @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed .",
    "finally , section 4 shows a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "the hamiltonian model proposed here @xcite is given by : @xmath24 with , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the chemical potential .",
    "the term @xmath27 , which represents the second - nearest - neighbors , is written as : @xmath28 the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the creation(annihilation ) operators for _ electrons _ with spin @xmath31 in a site @xmath32 .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 stands for the local coulomb interaction between two @xmath8-electrons with opposite spins . the model ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "considers a small @xmath33 hopping between @xmath8-orbitals and a large @xmath34 hopping between @xmath10-orbitals .",

    "however , in ref .",

    "@xcite , the band shift has been evaluated following the original roth s procedure @xcite , where @xmath83 for the @xmath22 nearest - neighbors has been considered .",
    "consequently , this procedure removes the @xmath2-dependence of the correlation functions ( mainly @xmath84 ) present in the band shift .",
    "however , the momentum dependence of such correlation functions is a fundamental ingredient to investigate anomalous properties like the pseudogap in the underdoped regime of the hubbard models @xcite .",

    "@xmath115 and the nature of the fermi surface changes to hole - like .",
    "however , it is in the underdoped regime , @xmath116 , that the topology of the fermi surface changes drastically with the emergence of a hole - pocket enclosing the nodal point @xmath117 . as a consequence , due to low spectral intensity",
    ", a pseudogap emerges near the antinodal points @xmath118 and @xmath119 , as shown in figure [ fig1](c ) .",
    "this result can be better understood by analyzing the features of the lower quasiparticle band which is strong affected by the antiferromagnetic correlations associated with the correlation function @xmath84 .",
    "figure [ fig2]a displays the quasiparticle band for distinct doping levels @xmath12 .",
    "while in the over and moderated doped regimes the quasiparticle bands cross the fermi level near @xmath117 and the antinodal point @xmath119 , in the underdoped regime the quasiparticle band crosses the fermi level twice nearer the nodal point @xmath117 .",
    "such a behavior gives rise to a pocket around @xmath117 ( see also figure [ fig1]c ) . on the other hand , as the quasiparticle band does not touch the fermi level near @xmath119 , a pseudogap emerges at that region .",
    "the kink observed near the @xmath120 point of the quasiparticle band is caused by the strong antiferromagnetic correlations associated with @xmath84 , which are maximum in * q*@xmath121 .",

    "figures [ fig2]b , [ fig2]c and [ fig2]d show the lower quasiparticle band for different @xmath13 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively . in [ fig2]b and [ fig2]c , it can be noted that while the coulomb interaction @xmath13 moves the quasiparticle band near @xmath124 to lower energies , the hybridization @xmath122 moves it to greater energies . indeed , @xmath13 and @xmath122 produce opposite effects on the pseudogap , i.e. , @xmath13 increases the width of the pseudogap while @xmath122 suppresses the pseudogap .",
    "such a behavior of the pseudogap is also clear observed in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the features observed in the fermi surfaces presented in figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are understood in terms of the antiferromagnetic correlations associated with the spin - spin correlation function @xmath3 introduced in equations ( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ sjsi2 ] ) .",
    "actually , @xmath125 which is the fourier transform of @xmath3 , is analyzed in the @xmath2-space .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows @xmath125 at the directions @xmath126-@xmath127-@xmath118 in the first brillouin zone . in [ fig5](a ) , with different doping levels @xmath12 , it is clear that @xmath125 is high doping dependent , mainly in the underdoped region close to the antiferromagnetic insulator ( afi ) phase . for @xmath114 ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath26 is moved to lower energies due to the low occupation @xmath128 . as a consequence",
    ", the fermi function removes states above the chemical potential leading to a suppression of @xmath125 for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 is the fermi wave vector ) .",
    "the doping region , from where the pseudogap emerges , coincides with that in which @xmath125 is very strong . in figure [ fig5](b ) , the effect of the coulomb interaction @xmath13 on @xmath125 is investigated .",
    "as it can be verified , @xmath13 increases the intensity of @xmath125 mainly at the antinodal points region . on the other hand",
    ", it has been verified that the @xmath1 hybridization @xmath131 acts on @xmath125 decreasing its intensity ( see figure [ fig5](c ) ) .",
    "finally , figure [ fig5](d ) shows @xmath125 for different temperatures .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the temperature decreases @xmath125 especially in the region of the antinodal points where the pseudogaps are present .",
    "this behavior comes from the effect of the temperature on the fermi function , i.e. , the fermi function increases it slope near the fermi level , suppressing @xmath125 when the temperature is enhanced .",
    "if the results from figures [ fig5](a ) , [ fig5](b ) and [ fig5](c ) are compared with those ones from figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , it is clear that the presence of pseudogaps on the fermi surface is directly related to the intensity of @xmath125 and , therefore , to antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "it is worth to notice that in the overdoped regime , where the correlations associated with @xmath125 are weakened , the effects of the hybridization are not very significant . in the underdoped regime , where mostly sites are single occupied , the hopping processes require a double occupied site . as a consequence ,",
    "the electrons tend to stay localized due to the high cost of energy ( @xmath13 ) to double occupy a site .",
    "nevertheless , if the hybridization is present , the hopping to a @xmath10 orbital in a site @xmath132 , via hybridization , can occur .",
    "thus , if the hybridization is favored , the occupation of the @xmath8-band may decrease depleting the spin - spin correlations .",
    "this scenario allows understanding the effects of the hybridization on the antiferromagnetic correlations ( associated with @xmath3 ) and , consequently , on the fermi surface topology .",
    "in the present work , the original two - poles approximation proposed by roth @xcite has been improved in order to consider the correct momentum dependence of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath3 .",
    "the structure of @xmath3 in the momentum space is essential to catch important effects due to antiferromagnetic corrrelations which , in the present approach , are the source of anomalies as pseudogap and hole - pockets on the fermi surface .",
    "the role of the antiferromagnetic correlations associated with the spin - spin correlation function has been investigated in different situations .",
    "initially , it is shown that the hole underdoped regime is characterized by the presence of hole - pockets enclosing the nodal points and pseudogaps near the antinodal points .",
    "the results show also that the coulomb interaction increases the region ( in the @xmath2 space ) of the pseudogap and decreases the area enclosed by the hole - pockets .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath131 hybridization acts in the sense of to decreasing the region ( in the @xmath2 space ) where the pseudogap occurs .",
    "if the @xmath131 is sufficiently high , the pseudogap vanishes and an ordinary large fermi surface is obtained .",
    "the scenario for the fermi surface described above , can be understood in terms of the antiferromagnetic correlations related to the spin - spin correlation function @xmath3 .",
    "the hole doping @xmath12 damps down the intensity of the correlation function @xmath3 .",
    "from the overdoped regime up to moderated doping levels @xmath133 , the antiferromagnetic correlations are weak and the fermi surfaces are typical of a normal metal without anomalies . in summary , it has been shown that in the underdoped regime , where @xmath3 is very strong , the pseudogap and the hole - pockets emerge . the local coulomb interaction",
    "@xmath13 increases the @xmath3 favoring the pseudogap and the hole - pockets . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath131 hybridization suppresses the @xmath3 recovering a large fermi surface as those ones observed in the overdoped regime .",
    "finally , the temperature acts on @xmath3 decreasing it , mainly , at the antinodal points which are the region of the pseudogap in the @xmath2 space .    to conclude",
    ", this work has presented a description for the hole - doped regime of the @xmath1 hubbard model within the n - pole approximation .",
    "particularly , in the underdoped regime , it has been shown a route which leads to pockets and pseudogap in the fermi surface .",
    "it should be remarked that the correlation function @xmath3 present in the band shift @xmath134 plays an important role in the underdoped situation .",
    "more precisely , antiferromagnetic correlations coming from @xmath3 strongly modify the quasi - particle band structure .",
    "this is the ultimate source of anomalies in the fermi surface in the present approach .",

    "<S> it is precisely the correlation function @xmath3 present in the poles of the green s functions which plays the important role in the underdoped situation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , antiferromagnetic correlations coming from @xmath3 strongly modify the quasi - particle band structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is the ultimate source of anomalies in the fermi surface in the present approach . </S>"
