    "studies on @xmath8 decays are mainly concentrated on the precise test of the standard model ( sm ) and the search for possible new physics ( np ) scenarios . to map out the apex in the unitarity triangle of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix ,",
    "many precise experimental data together with reliable theoretical predictions are required .",
    "in charmless two - body non - leptonic @xmath8 decays , the main experimental observables are branching ratios and cp asymmetries .",
    "to predict these observables , one has to compute the hadronic decay amplitudes @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is typically a four - quark or a magnetic moment type operator .",
    "since three hadronic states are involved in these decays , the predictions on these observables are often polluted by our poor knowledge of the non - perturbative qcd .",
    "fortunately , it has been suggested that in the @xmath11 limit , decay amplitudes can be studied in a well - organized way : they can be factorized into the convolution of non - perturbative objects such as @xmath8 to light form factors and decay constants of light pseudoscalars / vectors with perturbative hard kernels . in recent years",
    ", great progresses have been made in studies of charmless two - body @xmath8 decays .",
    "these decays were investigated in the so - called naive factorization approach  @xcite and the generalized factorization approach@xcite . at present , there are three commonly - accepted theoretical approaches to investigate the dynamics of these decays , the qcd factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite , and the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite . despite of many differences , all of them are based on power expansions in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the @xmath14-quark mass and @xmath15 is the typical hadronic scale .",
    "factorization of the hadronic matrix elements is proved to hold in the leading power in @xmath12 in a number of decays . in the present work ,",
    "we will focus on the scet .",
    "the matching from qcd onto scet is always performed in two stages .",
    "the fluctuations with off - shellness @xmath16 is firstly integrated out and one results in the intermediate effective theory . at final stage , we integrate out the hard - collinear modes with off - shellness @xmath17 to derive scet@xmath18 . in @xmath19",
    "decays , both of the final state mesons move very fast and are generated back - to - back in the rest frame of @xmath8 meson .",
    "correspondingly , there exist three typical scales : the @xmath14 quark mass @xmath13 , the soft scale @xmath15 set by the typical momentum of the light degrees of freedom in the heavy @xmath8 meson , the intermediate scale @xmath20 which arise from the interaction between collinear particles and soft modes .",
    "scet provides an elegant theoretical tool to separate the physics at different scales and factorization for @xmath19 was proved to hold to all orders in @xmath21 at leading power of @xmath22  @xcite . after integrating out the fluctuations with off - shellness @xmath23 ,",
    "one reaches the intermediate effective theory scet@xmath24 , in which the generic factorization formula for @xmath25 is written by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are perturbatively calculable wilson coefficients which depend on the lorentz structure and flavor structure .",
    "calculations for these hard kernel functions are approaching next - to - leading order accuracy  @xcite . in the second step , the fluctuations with typical off - shellness @xmath29 are integrated out and one reaches scet@xmath18 . in scet@xmath18 ,",
    "end - point singularities prohibit the factorization of @xmath30 , while the function @xmath31 can be further factorized into the convolution of a hard kernel ( jet function ) with light - cone distribution amplitudes : @xmath32    an essential question is whether power corrections in scet can be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "it is almost an impossible task to include all power corrections , but we can include the relatively important one .",
    "importance of chiraly enhanced penguins has been noted long time ago , and numerics show that chiraly enhanced penguins are comparable with the penguin contributions at leading power . thus in both of qcdf  @xcite and pqcd  @xcite approaches , it has been incorporated into the decay amplitudes besides the leading power penguins . in scet , the complete operator basis and the corresponding factorization formulae for this term are recently derived in ref .",
    "a new factorization formula for chiraly enhanced penguin was proved to hold to all orders in @xmath21 , and more importantly the factorization formula does not suffer from the endpoint divergence . in the factorization formula , a new form factor named @xmath33 and a twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitude @xmath34 are introduced .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , one phenomenological framework is introduced , in which the expansion at the intermediate scale @xmath35 is not used .",
    "instead the experimental data are used to fit the non - perturbative inputs .",
    "this method is very useful especially at tree level , since the function @xmath36 is a constant and @xmath37 is a function of only @xmath38 .",
    "thus only a few inputs are required in decay amplitudes . in this framework ,",
    "an additional term from the intermediate charm quark loops , which is called charming penguin  @xcite , is also taken into account .",
    "charming penguins are not factorized into the lcdas and form factors , since the heavy charm quark pair can not be viewed as collinear quarks .",
    "they are also treated as non - perturbative inputs .",
    "this method is first applied to @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it is extended to charmless two - body @xmath2 decays involving the iso - singlet mesons @xmath42 and @xmath43  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend this method to the @xmath0 decays .",
    "we will use the wealth of the experimental data to fit the non - perturbative inputs ( in our analysis , we also take the @xmath2 decays into account ) . in doing this",
    ", we would assume su(3 ) symmetry for form factors and charming penguins to reduce the number of independent non - perturbative inputs : there are totally 16 non - perturbative inputs to be determined .",
    "utilizing the meson matrices , we give the master equations for the hard kernels for @xmath19 decays . after analyzing",
    "the @xmath0 decays at leading power , we take part of chiraly enhanced penguin into account . with the chiraly enhanced penguins taken into account , we find most of the 16 inputs are not changed sizably except charming penguins .",
    "flavor singlet mesons @xmath42 and @xmath43 receive additional contributions ( gluonic contributions ) from higher fock state component . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gluonic form factors and gluonic charming penguins which are responsible for @xmath2 decays are fitted using the related experimental data . since there are not enough experimental results , the authors find two solutions for these inputs",
    "this situation is changed when considering @xmath0 decays since we have more data to give more stringent constraint . incorporating the @xmath0 experimental results for branching fractions and cp asymmetries , we find that our results are consistent with their second solution .",
    "we find two solutions for the inputs only responsible for @xmath0 decays .",
    "one of the solutions for @xmath44 form factors are smaller than those given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath45 data ( @xmath46 denotes a longitudinally polarized meson ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 branching ratios and cp - asymmetries @xmath49 and @xmath50 , are used .",
    "our second solution for @xmath44 form factors is more consistent with them . generally speaking , charming penguins in scet have the similar role with @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators in pqcd approach .",
    "both of them are essential to give the correct branching ratios in these two different approaches .",
    "but there are indeed some differences in predictions on other parameters such as direct cp asymmetries and mixing - induced cp asymmetries .",

    "the intrinsic transverse momentum can smear the end - point singularities which often appear in collinear factorization .",
    "resummation of double logarithms results in the sudakov factor which suppresses contributions from the end - point region to make the pqcd approach more self - consistent .",

    "annihilation diagrams are suppressed by @xmath12 but the suppression for @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators is @xmath540 .",
    "this factor is comparable with 1 .",
    "thus annihilations play a very important role in pqcd approach .",
    "phenomenologically , the large annihilations can explain the correct branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries of @xmath541 and @xmath542  @xcite , the polarization problem of @xmath543  @xcite , etc . in fig .",

    "[ diagram : chiralyenhancedpenguinannihilation](b ) have the same role with @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators in pqcd .",
    "both of them are essential to explain the branching ratios in these two different approaches .",
    "but there are indeed some differences in predictions on other parameters such as direct cp asymmetries and mixing - induced cp asymmetries .",
    "first of all , the ckm matrix elements associated with charming penguins and @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators are different . if we consider @xmath544 decays in which a @xmath14 quark annihilates , the @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators are proportional to @xmath545 , while charming penguins are proportional to @xmath546 .",
    "the differences in the ckm matrix elements will affect direct cp asymmetries and mixing - induced cp asymmetries sizably .",
    "for example , in @xmath547 decay , the mixing - induced cp asymmetries in scet are dramatically different from predictions in pqcd approach . in the scet framework",
    ", there is no contributions from tree operators to @xmath548 at tree level and penguin operators are much smaller than charming penguins .",
    "as the ckm matrix element @xmath546 for the charming penguin is real , the parameter @xmath96 defined in eq .",
    "becomes @xmath549 , where we have neglected contributions from penguin operators .",
    "thus in scet the two parameters @xmath550 and @xmath551 are given by : @xmath552 in pqcd approach , the ckm matrix element for the @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators is @xmath553 which gives @xmath554 : @xmath555 the differences in the mixing - induced cp asymmetries between scet and pqcd will be tested at the future experiments .    in pqcd approach , contributions from the @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators can be calculated using perturbation theory .",
    "these contributions are expressed as the convolution of light - cone distribution amplitudes and a hard kernel .",
    "we can also include su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects in the calculation in pqcd approach . in scet ,",
    "charming penguins are from the charm quark loops .",
    "since the charm quark is heavy , one can not factorize charming penguins ( see ref .",

    "the magnitudes and strong phases of charming penguins can not be calculated using perturbation theory which obtained by fitting the experimental data .",
    "the third difference is the magnitudes of charming penguins in scet and contributions from the @xmath7 annihilation penguin operators in pqcd approach .",
    "this difference arises from the different power counting in the two approaches .",
    "we take @xmath53 transitions to illustrate the difference . in pqcd",

    "the main strong phases in pqcd approach which are essential to explain the large cp asymmetries in many channels are also produced through from these operators .",
    "but in scet , as we have shown in eq .",
    "and eq .  , strong phases of charming penguins are not too large .",
    "accordingly , our predictions on direct cp asymmetries are small compared with predictions in pqcd approach .",
    "we provide the analysis of charmless two - body @xmath0 decays under the framework of soft - collinear - effective theory .",

    "our predictions on branching fractions are smaller than the ones calculated in the qcdf approach and pqcd approach .",
    "the main reason is that : both @xmath558 and @xmath44 form factors in scet are smaller .",
    "@xmath559 and other color - suppressed channels are predicted with a larger branching ratios in scet , because the hard scattering form factors @xmath560 are comparable with @xmath561 who also have a large wilson coefficients .",

    "<S> we provide the analysis of charmless two - body @xmath0 decays under the framework of the soft - collinear - effective - theory ( scet ) , where @xmath1 denotes a light vector ( pseudoscalar ) meson . besides the leading power contributions , some power corrections ( chiraly enhanced penguins ) </S>",
    "<S> are also taken into account . using the current available @xmath2 and @xmath0 experimental data on branching fractions and cp asymmetry variables , we find two kinds of solutions in @xmath3 fit for the 16 non - perturbative inputs which are essential in the 87 @xmath2 and @xmath0 decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> chiraly enhanced penguins can change several charming penguins sizably , since they share the same topology . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of the other non - perturbative inputs and predictions on branching ratios and cp asymmetries are not changed too much . with the two sets of inputs </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the branching fractions and cp asymmetries of other modes especially @xmath4 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the agreements and differences with results in qcd factorization and perturbative qcd approach are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the time - dependent cp asymmetries in channels with cp eigenstates in the final states and some other channels such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the perturbative qcd approach </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath7 penguins in annihilation diagrams play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> although they have the same topology with charming penguins in scet , there are many differences between the two objects in weak phases , magnitudes , strong phases and factorization properties . </S>"
