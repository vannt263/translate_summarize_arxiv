    "the simplest models that have been applied to ulx spectra are absorbed power - laws and thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "although formally a poor fit ( @xmath34/d.o.f@xmath38 ) , the single power - law model ( tbabs*powerlaw ) with @xmath39 is instructive in that its residuals show the high energy `` curvature '' often associated with ulxs @xcite and excess emission below 1  kev ( figure  [ epicspectrum ] ) .",
    "since galactic black hole binaries do not exhibit such curvature , ulxs are not simply scaled - up versions of ordinary stellar - mass black holes .",
    "a broken power - law ( tbabs*bknpower ) with a break energy near 4  kev is an adequate fit ( table  [ spectralfits ] ) , but it does not completely remove the excess below 0.4  kev ( figure  [ epicspectrum ] ) .",
    "likewise , a bremsstrahlung model ( tbabs*bremss ) is a good fit with @xmath40  kev but retains this excess .",
    "these fits can be improved by adding a cool thermal ( apec ) model with fixed @xmath41  kev ; @xmath42 in the broken power - law model for one fewer degree of freedom indicates an improvement at over 95% significance .",
    "in fact , the excess below 0.4  kev is present in all our fits ( figure  [ epicspectrum ] ) , but the pn and mos disagree at these energies ( see examples in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so we can not conclude that the thermal component is physical and do not include it in our reported fits .",
    "we also exclude mos data below 0.4  kev .",

    "we attempted some of the disk models recently tried on high quality _ xmm - newton _ spectra in grd09 and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* whose source ngc  4715 ulx1 has a qualitatively similar spectrum ) .",
    "these include a multi - colored disk ( mcd ) blackbody model ( tbabs*diskpbb ) , a mcd model with comptonization ( tbabs*(diskpbb+comptt ) ) , a disk irradiated by comptonized photons ( tbabs*diskir ) , and blurred reflection ( tbabs*kdblur2*reflionx ) . in the comptonization models ,",
    "the seed photons are assumed to originate at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "for the pure mcd model we use a `` @xmath43-free '' model in which @xmath44 , where @xmath43 is a free parameter ( in the normal mcd model diskbb , @xmath43 is frozen at @xmath45 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the best fit has an inner disk temperature @xmath46  kev and @xmath47 , indicating a hot , `` slim '' disk .",
    "the temperature can be lowered to @xmath48kev by adding a comptonization component , but based on simulated spectra the additional component does not significantly improve the fit . because the spectrum remains disk - dominated in either case , we find a degeneracy between a hot , optically thick corona or a cool , optically thin one .",
    "grd09 find that a cool , thick corona is preferred , but we find no global minimum and poor constraints due to the weakness of the component .",
    "we obtain a good fit for a cool disk with a dominant comptonization component when the disk structure is modified by the absorbing comptonized photons ( diskir ) . in this model ,",
    "the inner disk is irradiated by comptonized photons , many of which are `` reflected ''",
    ". some fraction is absorbed and re - emitted with a quasi - thermal spectrum , thereby modifying the disk emission @xcite .",
    "significant modification only occurs when the comptonized component is much brighter than the disk emission , naturally forcing fits with cool , relatively dim disks .",
    "thus , this model is expected to be important in the low / hard state  a very different situation from that implied by the mcd model . in order to fit this spectrum ,",
    "the compton hump must occur near 2  kev , implying a cool corona ( @xmath49  kev ) and a cooler disk ( @xmath50  kev ) .",
    "the intrinsic absorption is also substantially lower than in other models .",
    "it is also possible that much of the emission is comptonized photons `` reflected '' off the inner edge of the disk with substantial line `` blurring '' due to relativistic effects near the black hole . like @xcite",
    ", we find a significant amount of blurring is required such that the disk must reach to 1.26@xmath51 with an emissivity index @xmath52 , meaning that the emission is dominated by light from the inner disk .",
    "despite the high quality of the x - ray spectrum , several very different models produce excellent fits .",
    "thus , additional data at other wavebands or a timing study in the x - rays are required to discriminate between them .",

    "we might therefore expect to see absorption signatures in a high quality rgs spectrum , although the source geometry is unknown .",
    "detection of such an outflow would place a strong constraint on the mechanical luminosity , an important parameter in models of super - eddington accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the spectrum is dominated by a cool , comptonized component with the subjacent disk component dominant at low energies .",
    "this model presumes strong reflection , but the absence of a strong fe  k@xmath107 line is consistent with the low corona temperature ( @xmath108  kev ) .",
    "the emission comes almost exclusively from the very inner region of the disk , which itself is cool ( @xmath109  kev ) .",

    "however , the disk may be truncated at large radii outside of a large corona or outflow ( further discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which case the disk temperature can not be used to infer a mass .",
    "there are a few objections to this model .",
    "first , a cool disk component is only a good fit when irradiated , otherwise a hot disk is required ( even the `` cooler '' hot disk has @xmath48kev ) .",
    "if the disk were intrinsically cool , we would expect a non - irradiated cool disk to at least be competitive with the hot disk .",
    "second , if the black hole is in the low / hard state , the prior x - ray non - detections suggest it was previously quiescent ; even the naked disk in this model should have been detected .    fortunately , this model can be falsified in a few ways .",
    "the intrinsic absorption in this fit is small compared to the others , so if an optical counterpart could be established and its intrinsic color determined , a column could be measured .",
    "we would also expect to see variability like that in galactic low / hard states ( and potentially quasi - periodic oscillations as in * ? ? ?",

    "this model predicts a compton hump in the 1030  kev range , so observations above 10  kev could easily distinguish between this model and the others .",
    "whereas many ulxs are in galaxies with nuclear sources of comparable or greater brightness , ngc  891 ulx1 is presently the brightest x - ray source in the galaxy .",
    "as in the irradiated disk model , blurred reflection suggests the low / hard state .",
    "the caveats of the physical interpretation here are discussed in detail in @xcite , but we note here that this model requires suppression of the disk emission .     + like other ulx spectra , the mostly featureless continuum of ngc  891 ulx1 admits several different scenarios , suggesting observations in other wavebands or in the time domain are necessary to untangle the origin of the x - rays .",
    "given that the outburst is recent and preceded by at least a 20  year lull , a search for an ionized nebula like those seen around other nearby , bright ulxs @xcite is of interest .",
    "such a nebula would point to recurrent ultraluminous activity , and its size and power may allow measurement of the duty cycle .",
    "a recent _ xmm - newton _ observation revealed a bright new source towards ngc  891 . at this point ,",
    "the most natural explanation is that it is a source within the galaxy , in which case its flux and the absence of detections in other wavelengths makes a ulx the best explanation .",

    "however , several very different physical scenarios produce good fits to the spectrum , including an irradiated cool disk with strong but cool comptonization and a blurred reflection model .",
    "in the hot - disk model , ngc  891 ulx1 has a mass less than @xmath53 and therefore accretion rates over 5  times eddington .",
