    "mathematics can be done on two different levels .",
    "one level is rather informal , based on informal explanations , intuition , diagrams , etc . , and typical for everyday mathematical practice .",
    "another level is formal mathematics with proofs rigorously constructed by rules of inference from axioms .",
    "a large portion of mathematical logic and interactive theorem proving is aimed at linking these two levels .",
    "however , there is still a big gap : mathematicians still do nt feel comfortable doing mathematics formally and proof assistants still do nt provide enough support for dealing with large mathematical theories , automating technical problems , translating from one formalism to another , etc .",
    "we consider the following issue : there are several very mature and popular interactive theorem provers ( including isabelle , coq , mizar , hol - light , see @xcite for an overview ) , but they still can not easily share the same mathematical knowledge .",
    "this is a significant problem , because there are increasing efforts in building repositories of formalized mathematics , but  still developed within specific proof assistants .",
    "building a mechanism for translation between different proof assistants is non - trivial because of many deep specifics of each proof assistant ( there are some recent promissing approaches for this task @xcite ) . instead of developing a translation mechanism , we propose a proof representation and a corresponding xml - based format .",
    "the proposed proof representation is light - weight and it does not aim at covering full power of everyday mathematical proofs or full power of first order logic .",
    "still , it can cover a significant portion of many interesting mathematical theories .",
    "the underlying logic of our representation is coherent logic , a fragment of first - order logic .",
    "proofs in this format can be generated in an easy way by dedicated , coherent logic provers , but in principle , also by standard theorem provers .",
    "the proofs can be translated to a range of proof assistant formats , enabling sharing the same developments .",
    "we call our proof representation `` coherent logic vernacular '' .",
    "_ vernacular _ is the everyday , ordinary language ( in contrast to the official , literary language ) of the people of some country or region .",
    "a similar term , _ mathematical vernacular _ was used in 1980 s by de bruijn within his formalism proposed for trying to _ put a substantial part of the mathematical vernacular into the formal system _ @xcite .",
    "several authors later modified or extended de bruijn s framework .",
    "wiedijk follows de bruijn s motivation @xcite , but he also notices :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ it turns out that in a significant number of systems ( ` proof assistants ' ) one encounters languages that look almost the same .",

    "our proof representation is developed also with _",
    "readable proofs _ in mind .",
    "readable proofs ( e.g. , textbook - like proofs ) , are very important in mathematical practice .",
    "for mathematicians , the main goal is often , not only a trusted , but also a clear and intuitive proof .",
    "we believe that coherent logic is very well suited for automated theorem proving with a simple production of readable proofs .",
    "in this section , we give a brief overview of interactive theorem proving and proof assistants , of coherent logic , which is the logical basis for our proof representation , and of xml , which is the technical basis for our proof format .",
    "interactive theorem proving systems ( or _ proof assistants _ ) support the construction of formal proofs by a human , and verify each proof step with respect to the given underlying logic .",
    "the proofs can be written either in a _ declarative _ or in a _ procedural _ proof style . in the procedural proof style , the proof is described by a sequence of commands which modify the incomplete proof tree . in the declarative proof style the formal document includes the intermediate statements .",
    "both styles are avaible in hol - light , isabelle  @xcite and coq proof assistants whereas only the declarative style is available in mizar , see  @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "the procedural proof style is more popular in the coq community .",
    "formal proofs are typically much longer than `` traditional proofs . ''",
    "progress in the field can be measured by proof scripts becoming shorter and yet contain enough information for the system to construct and verify the full ( formal ) proof .",
    "`` traditional proofs '' can often hardly be called proofs , because of the many missing parts , informal arguments , etc . using interactive theorem proving",
    "uncovered many flaws in many published mathematical proofs ( including some seminal ones ) , published in books and journals .",
    "coherent logic ( cl ) was initially defined by skolem and in recent years it gained new attention @xcite .",
    "it consists of formulae of the following form :    @xmath0    which are implicitly universally quantified , and where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 denotes a sequence of variables @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 ( for @xmath7 ) denotes an atomic formula ( involving zero or more of the variables from @xmath3 ) , @xmath8 denotes a sequence of variables @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 ) denotes a conjunction of atomic formulae ( involving zero or more of the variables from @xmath3 and @xmath8 ) . for simplicity , we assume that there are no function symbols with arity greater than zero ( so , we only consider symbols of constants as ground terms )",
    ".    the definition of cl does not involve negation . for a single atom @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 can be represented in the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 stands for the empty disjunction , but more general negation must be expressed carefully in coherent logic . in order to reason with negation in general , new predicate symbols are used to abbreviate subformulas . furthermore , for every predicate symbol @xmath17 ( that appears in negated form ) , a new symbol @xmath18 is introduced that stands for @xmath19 , and the following axioms are postulated ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "cl allows existential quantifications of the conclusion of a formula , so cl can be considered to be an extension of resolution logic .",
    "in contrast to the resolution - based proving , the conjecture being proved is kept unchanged and directly proved ( refutation , skolemization and transformation to clausal form are not used ) .",
    "hence , proofs in cl are natural and intuitive and reasoning is constructive .",
    "readable proofs ( in the style of forward reasoning and a variant of natural deduction ) can easily be obtained @xcite .",
    "a number of theories and theorems can be formulated directly and simply in cl . in cl ,",
    "constructive provability is the same as classical provability .",
    "it can be proved that any first - order formula can be translated into a set of cl formulas ( in a different signature ) preserving satisfiability @xcite ( however , this translation does not always preserve constructive provability ) .",
    "coherent logic is semi - decidable and there are several implemented semi - decision procedures for it @xcite .",
    "argoclp @xcite is a generic theorem prover for coherent logic , based on a simple proof procedure with forward chaining and with iterative deepening .",
    "argoclp can read problems given in tptp form @xcite and can export proofs in the xml format that we describe in this paper .",
    "these proofs are then translated into target languages , for instance , the isar language or natural language thanks to appropriate xslt style - sheets .",
    "_ extensible markup language _",
    "( xml ) is a simple , flexible text format , inspired by sgml ( iso 8879 ) , for data structuring using tags and for interchanging information between different computing systems .",
    "xml is primarily a `` metalanguage''a language for describing other customized markup languages .",
    "so , it is not a fixed format like the markup language html  in xml the tags indicate the semantic structure of the document , rather than only its layout .",
    "xml is a project of the world wide web consortium ( w3c ) and is a public format .",
    "almost all browsers that are currently in use support xml natively .",
    "there are several schema languages for formaly specifying the structure and content of xml documents of one class .",
    "some of the main schema languages are dtd ( _ data type definition _ ) , xml schema , relax , etc . @xcite .",

    "_ extensible style - sheet language transformation _ ( xslt ) is a document processing language that is used to transform the input xml documents to output files .",
    "an xslt style - sheet declares a set of rules ( templates ) for an xslt processor to use when interpreting the contents of an input xml document .",
    "these rules tell to the xslt processor how that data should be presented : as an xml document , as an html document , as plain text , or in some other form .",
    "the proposed proof representation is very usable and expressive , yet very simple .",

    "note that the rule @xmath29 actually combines universal instantiation , conjunction introduction , modus ponens , and elimination of ( zero or more ) existential quantifiers .",
    "this seems a reasonable granularity for an inference step , albeit probably the maximum for keeping proofs readable .",
    "compared to  @xcite which defines the notion of obvious inference rule by putting constraints on an automated prover , our position is : the obvious inferences are the ones defined by the inference rules above . compared to the rules given in  @xcite , we choose to separate the @xmath42 rule ( disjunction elimination ) and the @xmath43 rule from the single combined rule in  @xcite , in order to improve readability .",

    "also , @xmath44 could be seen as a @xmath42 with zero cases , but this would be less readable .    any coherent logic proof can be represented in the following simple way ( @xmath45 is used zero or more time , @xmath46 involves at least two other @xmath47 objects ) : @xmath48",

    "@xcite in the context of a new axiomatic foundations of geometry . a recent paper by ganesalingam and gowers @xcite is also related to our work .",
    "their goal is comparable to ours : full automation combined with human - style output .",
    "they propose inference rules which are very similar to our coherent logic based proof system .",
    "for example , their rule @xmath65 corresponds to the rule @xmath42 , @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath49 , @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath49 ( with length of @xmath68 greater than 0 ) , @xmath69 corresponds to the rule @xmath29 . yet , some rules they proposed are not part of our set of rules .",
    "the logic they use is full first - order , with a plan to include second - order features ( this would also be perfectly possible for coherent logic , which is the first - order fragment of _ geometric _ logic , which is in turn a fragment of higher - order logic , see @xcite ) . upon closer inspection",
    ", the paper by ganesalingam and gowers seems to stay within the coherent fragment , and proofs by contraposition and contradiction are delegated to future work .",
    "we find some support for our approach in the observation by ganesalingam and gowers that it will be hard to avoid that such reasoning patterns are applied in `` inappropriate contexts '' . on the other hand ,",
    "the primary domain of application of their approach is metric space theory so far , with the ambition to attack problems in other domains as well .",
    "it would be very interesting to test the two approaches on the same problem sets .",
    "one difference is that @xcite insists on proofs being faithful to the thought processes , whereas we would be happy if the prover finds a short and elegant proof even after a not - so - elegant proof search .",
    "another difference is that we are interested in portability of proofs to other systems . to our knowledge ,",
    "the prover described in @xcite is not publicly available .",
    "compared to omdoc  @xcite , our proof format is much more specific ( as we specify the inference rules we use ) and has less features . it can be seen as a specific set of ` methods ` elements of the ` derive ` element of omdoc .",
    "an alternative to using coherent logic provers would be using one of the more powerful automated theorem provers and exploiting existing and ongoing work on proof reconstruction and refactoring ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this is certainly a viable option .",
    "however , reconstructing a proof from the log of a highly optimized prover is difficult .",
    "one problematic step is deskolemization , that is , proof reconstruction from a proof of the skolemized version of the problem .",
    "( the most efficient provers are based on resolution logic , and clausification including skolemizing is the first step in the solution procedure . )",
    "what can be said about this approach in its current stage is that more theorems can be proved , but their proofs can still be prohibitively complicated ( or use additional axioms ) .",
    "it has been , however , proved beneficial to use powerful automated theorem provers as preprocessors , to provide hints for argoclp .",
    "the literature contains many results about exchanging proofs between proof assistant using deep or shallow embeddings  @xcite .",
    "boessplug , cerbonneaux and hermant propose to use the @xmath70-calculus as a universal proof language which can express proof without losing their computational properties  @xcite . to our knowledge , these works do not focus on the readability of proofs .",
    "over the last years a lot of effort has been invested in combining the power of automated and interactive theorem proving : interactive theorem provers are now equipped with trusted support for sat solving , smt solving , resolution method , etc @xcite .",
    "these combinations open new frontiers for applications of theorem proving in software and hardware verification , but also in formalization of mathematics and for helping mathematicians in everyday practice . exporting proofs in formats such as the presented one opens new possibilities for exporting readable mathematical knowledge from automated theorem provers to interactive theorem provers . in the presented approach ,",
    "the task of generating object - level proofs for proof assistants or proofs expressed in natural language is removed from theorem provers ( where it would be hard - coded ) and , thanks to the interchange xml format , delegated to simple xslt style - sheets , which are very flexible and additional xslt style - sheets ( for additional target formats ) can be developed without changing the prover . also , different automated theorem provers can benefit from this suite , as they do nt have to deal with specifics of proof assistants .",
    "the presented proof representation is not intended to serve as `` the mathematical vernacular '' .",
    "however , it can cover a significant portion of many interesting mathematical theories while it is very simple .",
    "often , communication between an interactive theorem prover and an external automated theorem prover is supported by a verified , trusted interface which enables direct calling to the prover . on the other hand ,",
    "our work yields a common format which can be generated by different automated theorem provers and from which proofs for different interactive theorem provers can be generated .",
    "the advantage of our approach relies on the fact that the proof which is exported is not just a certificate , it is meant to be human readable .",
    "the current version of the presented xml suite does not support function symbols of arity greated than 0 .",
    "for the future work , we are planning to add that support to the proof format and to our argoclp prover .    in the current version , for simplicity ,",
    "the generated isar and coq proofs use tactics stronger than necessary .",
    "we will try to completely move to basic proofs steps while keeping simplicity of proofs . beside planning to further improve existing xslt style - sheets , we are also planning to implement support for additional target languages such as omdoc .",
