[ sco100 ] ) , i.e. having similar properties than that of the abovementioned a - type sample .",
    "we observed 15 such systems in the framework of our two surveys but none of them were detected , thus based on the current data sets the presence of co molecules may be the characteristic of debris disks around young a - type stars .",
    "@xcite detected hi lines in mid - infrared spectrum of eight young debris disks around f - k type stars .",
    "the presence of these lines can be explained either by low rate gas accretion onto these stars or chromospheric activity . in the case of former scenario",
    "these findings would indicate that some disks around f - k type stars can also retain primordial gas for their debris phase .",
    "based on its infrared and submillimeter continuum data the dust disk properties of hd131835 are similar to those of the other young debris disks .",
    "although the disk has a high total fractional luminosity of @xmath03@xmath2010@xmath67 this value is still less than the usually invoked threshold value of 0.01 , that divides protoplanetary and debris disks .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced a new classification scheme to differentiate between herbig ae disks and debris disks with a - type host stars .",
    "this method is based on the ratios of the observed to the stellar photospheric fluxes at 12 and 70 ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) . for debris disks @xmath156 and @xmath157 have to be lower than 3 and 2000 , respectively . based on color - corrected wise 12 and pacs 70 data and predicted photospheric fluxes we derived @xmath158 and @xmath159 for hd131835 , i.e. it can be classified as a debris disk .",
    "the majority of herbig ae systems show pah emission .",
    "the absence of pah features in the irs spectrum of hd131835 is also in accordance with its classification as a debris disk .",
    "these arguments suggest that the observed excess emission is due to dust grains that are probably second generation , produced via erosion of larger unseen bodies .",
    "according to the current paradigm the gas content of debris disks may also be second generation , derived from previously formed planetesimals .",
    "however , in young disks we can not exclude the possibility that the evolution of dust and gas were not parallel and the observed gas is predominantly composed of residual primordial material ( of course we never exclude that a part of the gas is produced from already emerged icy bodies ) .",
    "indeed , though most known gaseous debris disks are proposed to be rather secondary , one of the oldest among them , hd21997 may likely harbor a hybrid disk with a significant amount of primordial gas @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we investigate the origin of gas in the hd131835 system . in this analysis we considered the @xmath1pic and hd21997 systems as references :",

    "the contribution of interstellar radiation field were computed from @xcite .",
    "our calculations yielded a co lifetime of 40yr at the directly illuminated inner edge of the disk and of 500yr in the most efficiently self - shielded mid - plane regions . assuming that the gas is continuously replenished and taking the co mass of 1.0@xmath2010@xmath67m@xmath76 we obtained a co production rate of @xmath129 2@xmath2010@xmath160m@xmath76yr@xmath11 or 1.2@xmath2010@xmath161 kg  yr@xmath11 .",
    "this is at least eight times higher than the gas production rate obtained for the @xmath1pic disk from its alma observation @xcite .",
    "assuming a co mass abundance of 10% in planetesimals , it would require destruction at least of 2@xmath2010@xmath134m@xmath76yr@xmath11 of icy bodies .",
    "the co gas can be released from icy grains / planetesimals in different processes .",
    "the temperature significantly exceeds the value needed for the sublimation of pure co ice ( @xmath020k ) everywhere in the disk .",
    "in such environment co ice is thought to be mainly present in deeper layers of icy planetesimals and as admixture in the amorphous water ice on the surface of grains and larger bodies .",
    "thus photodesorption or , in warmer regions ( @xmath90 110k ) , sublimation of surface water ices can produce co gas as well .",
    "co entrapped in water ice matrix can also be released via collisions between grains and planetesimals , moreover fragmentation of larger bodies can lead to the excavation of co ices persisted in deeper layers .",

    "based on alma observations of @xcite the @xmath163 ratio measured for @xmath1pic disk is 3.6@xmath164 ( note that they used an assumption of lte , and if it is not fulfilled the co mass could be higher , see also in * ? ? ?",

    "for hd21997 we measured a @xmath01000 times higher @xmath163 ratio ( note that here we used the optically thin @xmath9c@xmath165o line to estimate the co mass ) than for the @xmath1  pic .",

    "the @xmath163 ratio depends both on the dust and gas production rates and on the removal time of the two elements .",
    "the observed higher co - to - dust mass ratios thus can be explained e.g. by a more effective self - shielding due to larger co density which would result in higher co lifetime or by higher fraction of volatile material in icy planetesimals / grains .     and [ gaseousdisks2 ] .",
    "hd32297 was placed at its lower age limit proposed by @xcite . for fomalhaut and hd107146",

    "the co mass and upper limit were computed by adopting an excitation temperature of 20k and using the co ( 32 ) line fluxes from @xcite .",
    "their dust masses were computed from their submillimeter fluxes @xcite using the standard way .",
