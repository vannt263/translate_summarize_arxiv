    "@xcite show how the small scale ordering of the structure functions ( sf ) is completely modified in the solar wind when passing from small to large scales . while the small - scale anisotropy is roughly compatible with three - dimensional anisotropic phenomenology of turbulence @xcite , the large - scale anisotropy has no explanation so far .",
    "in this letter we focus on the large - scale ordering and we explain it with phenomenological arguments supported by dns of mhd equations modified to include expansion ( expanding box model or ebm , @xcite ) .",
    "the ebm has been recently used @xcite to show the scale - dependent competition between two axes of symmetry , the mean field axis and the radial axis . here",
    "we show that it is able to reproduce both the large and small scale anisotropy of the sf along the three ortogonal direction defining the frame attached to the local , scale - dependent mean field .",
    "we follow the evolution of a plasma volume embedded in a mean flow with constant speed .",
    "turbulent evolution with distance is thus modeled as decaying , unforced turbulence .",
    "two runs are analyzed : run a assumes a _ uniform parallel mean flow _ , run b assumes a _ radial mean flow _ , as is the solar wind .",
    "the full mhd equations ( continuity , induction , velocity and energy equations ) , are integrated in time with a pseudo - spectral code on a grid of @xmath3 points . for run",
    "b , the mhd equations are modified to incorporate expansion , becoming the ebm equations @xcite . in the following , velocities are normalized to the initial rms amplitude of velocity fluctuations @xmath4 , lengths to the box size @xmath5 , and time to the initial eddy turnover time @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath7 is also expressed in unit of alfvn speed , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the average density .",
    "we first define the expanding run b. the reference frame , @xmath10 , is aligned with the r ,  t ,  n coordinates of the heliocentric reference frame ( figure  [ fig0]a ) .",
    "the domain is advected by the solar wind at a constant speed @xmath11 : different times @xmath12 correspond to different heliocentric distances , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the initial position of the simulation domain . during advection ,",
    "the domain inflates anisotropically : the radial dimension @xmath15 does not change with time , while the lateral dimensions scale as @xmath16 .",
    "the rate of inflation is set by the expansion parameter , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the initial expansion time .",
    "we fix the initial heliocentric distance @xmath19 , the lateral dimension of the numerical domain @xmath20 , and the ratio @xmath21 , yielding finally @xmath22 .",
    "the initial aspect ratio is @xmath23 so that at @xmath24 we have a cubic numerical domain @xmath25  au .",
    "the conservation of magnetic flux implies @xmath26 , we thus impose an oblique initial mean field , @xmath27 $ ] , to have an average parker spiral angle of @xmath0 at 1  au .",
    "finally we set equal viscosity , resistivity , and conductivity , @xmath28 and allow the coeffcients to vary as @xmath29 to cope with the damping of fluctuations due to expansion .",

    "for each couple of points @xmath49 separated by the increment @xmath50 , we define the local mean field as @xmath51 and the fluctuating field as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "the local scale - dependent reference frame , shown in figure  [ fig0]b , has the vertical axis @xmath54 oriented along @xmath2 , the first perpendicular axis @xmath55 oriented along the perpendicular fluctuation direction @xmath56 $ ] , and the second perpendicular axis @xmath57 perpendicular to both @xmath2 and @xmath58 . in this reference frame , the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath59 and @xmath60 define the direction of increment with respect to the local mean field . for each pair of points the @xmath61-trace structure function , @xmath62 , is accumulated in @xmath63 bins for @xmath64 $ ] , and then averaged in each bin ( we reflected below @xmath65 any angles larger than @xmath65 ) .",

    "we first present the results of the flyby analysis on simulated data at @xmath68 for run a and at @xmath69 for run b. we then show how the anisotropy evolves in time in the two runs . while @xmath70 in run b is chosen to reproduce data at @xmath71  au",
    ", the choice for run a is arbitraty .",
    "homogeneous runs evolve more rapidly than expanding runs since , in the latter , fluctuations are damped by both turbulence and expansion and so the nonlinear time increases more rapidly .",
    "we thus chose a different time in run a , after the peak of current density ( @xmath72 ) but not too late , in order to have a reynolds number @xmath73 and @xmath74 comparable to those of run b at @xmath69 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) . , where @xmath77 and @xmath78",

    "increments are taken along the @xmath66 direction , which forms an angle of @xmath0 with the mean field @xmath84 . at large scales",
    "@xmath85 the sfs have comparable energy in the three directions . at small scales ,",
    "@xmath86 , we have @xmath87 with the the following approximate scaling @xmath88 ( the power - law range is actually smaller in @xmath55 and @xmath54 ) .    in panel",
    "( b ) we show the same plot for the expanding run b. its overall structure differs completely from run a. now @xmath89 and @xmath90 have parallel profiles roughly proportional to @xmath91 in the small - scale range , @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath89 is dominant everywhere , while @xmath93 passes from almost dominant at large scales ( @xmath94 ) to subdominant at small scales , where the ordering is the same as for the homogeneous run a.         following @xcite , another viewpoint of the anisotropy in the expanding case is given in figure  [ fig2 ] , where we plot the isosurfaces of constant sf power at three different levels ( marked as dashed lines in figure  [ fig1]b ) , corresponding , from left to right , to smaller and smaller scales .",
    "for a given value of the isosurface , its shape indicates the correlation of fluctuations along the three directions of the local frame , and can be roughly thought as a statistical eddy shape .",
    "since @xmath95 measures the power in the anticorrelation , the more energetic is the sf along a given direction , the smaller its correlation . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , the smallest correlation ( smallest elongation of the isosurface ) is always in the @xmath57 direction , but the direction of the largest correlation changes with scales . at large scales ( figure  [ fig2]a ) , the eddy is more elongated in the @xmath55 direction , corresponding to @xmath58 , at small scales ( figure  [ fig2]c ) it becomes more elongated along the @xmath54 direction , corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "the anisotropy shown in figure  [ fig1]b and figure  [ fig2 ] are in very good agreement with the observations of @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig1]b the small - scale anisotropy ( @xmath96 ) is roughly consistent with critical balance , while the large - scale behavior ( @xmath94 ) requires some more explanation .",
    "the large - scales ordering of sfs is related to the component anisotropy of the magnetic fluctuations that originates from the selective damping induced by the expansion .",
    "the component anisotropy is shown in figure  [ fig3]a , where we plot the reduced energy spectra @xmath97 of the @xmath98 , and @xmath99 components of the magnetic fluctuations compensated by @xmath100 , for runs a and b. while in the non - expanding case energy is distributed isotropically among the components , in the expanding case the radial component is at least a factor 2 smaller , at all scales .",
    "this behavior is consistent with observations @xcite and is generally found in expanding runs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the link between the component anisotropy and the sf anisotropy is shown in figure  [ fig3]b where we plot their evolution with time .",
    "the sf anisotropy is quantified as the ratio @xmath101 at @xmath102 ( see @xcite for a similar analysis on global sf ) , while the component anisotropy is evaluated as @xmath103 at @xmath104 . for the homogenous run",
    "a , both ratios are about constant and close to the value of 1 ( isotropy ) , while in run b both ratios increase steadily and approximately with the same rate .",
    "thus , in the expanding case as the heliocentric distance increases the magnetic fluctuations are more and more confined in the @xmath105 plane ( the t , n plane ) , and so also the local mean field will preferentially lie in this plane .",
    "we now show that when the sf is sampled along the radial direction , the above component anisotropy , @xmath106 , implies that the sf has a different power along the three directions @xmath83 defining the local reference frame .",
    "consider two vectors @xmath107 at positions @xmath108 and @xmath109 and indicate with @xmath110 their components in the @xmath105 plane ( @xmath111 ) , with @xmath112 the angle between them , and with @xmath113 their projection along @xmath66 .",
    "assume also for simplicity @xmath114 the local mean field and the fluctuation in the @xmath105 plane are given by @xmath115 ( @xmath116 should not be confused with @xmath117 that defines the local reference frame ) .",
    "these equations simply state that when @xmath118 and @xmath119 are aligned ( anti - aligned ) the local field @xmath120 is large ( small ) and the fluctuating field @xmath121 is small ( large ) .",
    "the orientation of the local reference frame with respect to the fixed radial direction @xmath66 determines which local sf we are measuring : we cumulate the power in @xmath89 or in @xmath93 or in @xmath90 when @xmath57 or @xmath54 or @xmath55 lies along @xmath66 .",
    "we thus estimate the leading order contributions associated to each of them by considering the power @xmath122 associated to the above three orientations :    * to have power in @xmath89 one needs both @xmath2 and @xmath123 to lie in the @xmath105 plane , that is , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this condition is readily satisfied from equation  , provided that @xmath126 , or @xmath127 and @xmath128 in equations  - , yielding in both cases @xmath129 . *",
    "the contribution to @xmath93 is obtained when @xmath2 is aligned along @xmath66 , that is @xmath130 .",
    "this happens only when @xmath127 and @xmath131 in equation  , implying from equation   a contribution @xmath132 .",
    "* finally , to have power in @xmath90 , @xmath2 must belong the @xmath105 plane and @xmath123 must have a non negligible @xmath66 component @xmath133 ( our minimum angular resolution is @xmath63 ) .",
    "the conditions @xmath134 and @xmath135 are satisfied in equations  - only when @xmath127 and @xmath136 , which yield a power @xmath137 .    thus , the geometrical constraint imposed by the component anisotropy induced by expansion , @xmath106 , favors a local anisotropy with @xmath138 , as is indeed found at large scales in figure  [ fig1]b and in the solar wind observations .",
    "we finally show how the anisotropy of expanding turbulence changes if one samples increments in directions perpendicular to the radial . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot the sfs of run b computed along @xmath139 and @xmath140 , corresponding to the r and t directions , respectively .",
    "the sfs are now compensated by @xmath141 to highlight inertial - range scales and the corresponding spectral index . independently of the direction of increments",
    ", the inertial range extends to smaller scales in the second perpendicular direction ( @xmath57 ) than in the first perpendicular direction ( @xmath55 ) . the parallel direction ( @xmath54 )",
    "does not show any convincing scaling , although having a steeper spectrum .",
    "the direction of increments affect the overall anisotropy .",
    "in fact , the large - scale ordering , characteristic of expansion in panel ( a ) , disappears when increments are along the transverse direction ( panel ( b ) ) , the sf becoming basically isotropic for @xmath94 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a reduced effect of the component anisotropy when increments are along the transverse direction ( a similar behavior is seen for @xmath142 , not shown ) .",
    "moreover the two perpendicular sfs ( blue and green curve ) exhibit a different spectral index , passing from a slope @xmath143 in panel ( a ) to steeper spectral index @xmath144 in panel ( b ) .",
    "note finally that the eddy shape for transverse increments is at all scales qualitatively similar to the anisotropy in figure  [ fig2]c , and thus differs completely from the cases of radial increments shown in figure  [ fig2]a , b .",
    "we computed the 3d anisotropy of structure functions with respect to the local mean field in dns of mhd turbulence , including or not expansion . for homogenous turbulence ,",
    "the sf is roughly isotropic at large scales and develops scale - dependent anisotropy at small scales due to the different scaling along the different local directions .",
    "the corresponding spectral indices are roughly consistent with @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the @xmath147 and @xmath54 directions respectively . such an ordering has been predicted by @xcite and implies that @xmath87 at small scales .",
    "the homogenous run qualitatively agrees with the above power anisotropy , which is stable although the precise slopes vary with time and with sampling direction .",
    "when expansion is taken into account the anisotropy is determined by a well - defined large - scale power anisotropy and by a different scaling along the parallel direction ( @xmath54 ) and the two perpendicular directions ( @xmath147 ) , the latter now having approximately the same spectral index ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "we found that the overall sf anisotropy is a consequence of the component anisotropy induced by expansion and that it shows up only when increments are computed along the radial direction .",
    "when increments are along the transverse direction , the large - scale anisotropy disappears , the eddy shape does not change with scales ( although the anisotropy increases at smaller and smaller scales ) , and the sfs exhibit steeper spectral scaling .",
    "thus , the measured anisotropy of solar wind turbulence would change for increments in directions other than the radial , a situation that may become possible to test with solar probe plus in its near - sun orbital phase .",
    "let us compare our results with the observations in the fast solar wind @xcite .",
    "in run b the choice of the solar wind speed yields , via the taylor hypothesis , the spacecraft frequencies corresponding to the radial increments in figure  [ fig1 ] and figure  [ fig2 ] . for a fast wind @xmath149",
    ", one gets @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "our initial fluctuations have vanishing @xmath152 correlations for easier comparison between the expanding and homogenous runs , while fast wind has high correlations .",
    "contrary to the non - expanding case , initially highly correlated fluctuations lead to fully developed turbulence in expanding runs @xcite , with a sf anisotropy similar to ( expanding ) runs with vanishing @xmath152 correlations .",
    "finally , for scales in between 5 - 10 hours , the ratio @xmath153 for both fast and slow wind @xcite , thus the expanding parameter @xmath22 is suited for both types of wind .",
    "to conclude , as far as the local anisotropy is concerned , the results presented in this letter are representative of both fast and slow wind and match observations in the fast solar wind , including the change of anisotropy with scales . they indicate that expansion , by distributing energy among different components of the magnetic fluctuations , affects the local mean field orientation and hence the observed anisotropy with respect to it .",
    "the present results complement those ones obtained in the recent numerical study by @xcite on the _ global anisotropy _ in the solar wind .",
    "both studies show that expansion strongly affects anisotropy of solar wind turbulence at inertial range scales .",
    "finally , the convergence found with observations proves the validity of the ebm approach to model and study solar wind turbulence .",
