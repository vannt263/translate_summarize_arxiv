    "the successful launch of the swift satellite in november 2004 filled a crucial gap in the gamma - ray burst data at early times  between a minute to a few hours  that existed in prior grb missions .",
    "this has led to a number of very interesting discoveries regarding emission from grbs on time scales of minutes following a burst .",
    "one of these discoveries is that the very early x - ray lightcurve ( lc ) of many bursts falls off very rapidly : @xmath1 ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 , goad et al .",
    "2005 , burrows et al .",
    "2005 , chincarini et al .",
    "this phase of rapid fall off lasts for about 5 minutes , and is followed by the usual @xmath2 behavior . in most cases ,",
    "no change to the spectral slope is seen accompanying the change to the lightcurve . in this paper",
    ", we discuss two bursts exhibiting such behavior , grbs 050126 and 050219a . we provide an argument that the @xmath0-rays and the early x - rays ( for the first @xmath35 minutes ) have a common source , and we determine the physical properties of the source ( next section ) .",
    "we start with some very general physical considerations and describe a model with as few assumptions as possible to try to understand the @xmath0-ray and x - ray emissions together .",
    "we do not assume that @xmath0-rays are produced in the internal shock or external shock or any other of a number of different models that have been suggested .",
    "we determine the properties of the @xmath0-ray source from the data and use it to decide which of the proposed models , if any , work .",
    "the only assumption that we make is that @xmath0-rays are generated by synchrotron or inverse - compton ( ic ) mechanisms  an assumption that is supported by their non - thermal spectrum and also indirectly by the excellent overall agreement between models based on synchrotron & ic emission and multiwavelength afterglow data for a large number of grbs ( piran , 2005 ; mszros & rees , 1999 ; panaitescu & kumar , 2002 ; granot et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the two bursts considered here have @xmath0-ray light curves dominated by a single peak and small fluctuations and therefore much of the @xmath0-ray flux is likely produced in a single source localized in space .",
    "in such a case the synchrotron and ic emissions from the object are completely determined if we know the magnetic field strength ( @xmath4 ) , the optical thickness of the object to thomson scattering ( @xmath5 ) , the speed of the object toward the observer ( lorentz factor ",
    "@xmath6 ) , the total number of radiating particles assuming isotropic source ( @xmath7 ) , and the minimum energy for radiating particles , @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 is electron mass & @xmath10 is the speed of light ) .",
    "the particle energy distribution above @xmath11 , at the acceleration region where particles have not suffered appreciable loss of energy , is assumed to be a power - law function with index @xmath12 .",
    "the energy distribution of particles for the entire population , however , is not a single power law function due to the loss of energy via radiative processes .",
    "we determine this modified distribution numerically by carrying out a self - consistent calculation of synchrotron cooling and self - absorption frequencies as described in panaitescu & mszros ( 2000 ) , and mcmahon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the average energy per particle , at the acceleration site , in the comoving frame of the source is @xmath13 , and therefore @xmath14 ; where @xmath15 is the isotropic equivalent of energy in @xmath0-rays .",
    "the index @xmath12 is determined by the observed spectral index ; we take @xmath16 when the spectrum above the peak is not known ",
    "results reported here have been checked for dependence on @xmath12 , and found qualitatively to be insensitive to @xmath12 .",
    "so we are left with four unknown parameters viz . , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "the observational constraints on these parameters are : the @xmath0-ray flux at the peak of the observed light curve , the frequency at which the spectrum peaks , the duration of the burst , the spectral index below the peak , and the optical flux limit ( when available ) .",
    "the last two constraints are not independent and typically provide a limit on synchrotron cooling and/or injection frequencies .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 determine the distance of the @xmath0-ray source from the center of the explosion : @xmath17 ; and the burst duration @xmath18 .",
    "the parameters we use describe the state of the @xmath0-ray producing source at the time of the peak of the observed lightcurve .",
    "the observed peak flux is the synchrotron or inverse - compton flux in the appropriate observer energy band which is determined from @xmath4 , @xmath7 ( the total number of electrons / positrons in the source ) , @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath6 ; the details of the calculation is described in kumar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . by searching the parameter space ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 ) for emission properties consistent with those observed for each burst we can decide among various grb models . as we shall see",
    ", we are led to more or less a unique solution : @xmath0-rays are generated via synchrotron - self - ic ( ssc ) in a source with typical electron energy less than 10@xmath19 and with properties that favor the external reverse - shock or internal shocks .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-ray source we thus find also accounts for the early x - ray afterglow in a natural way , as off axis flux from the @xmath0-ray emitting material or flux from the adiabatically cooling source .",
    "results for 050126 and 050219a are discussed below .",
    "grb 050126 was 25s long with a fluence in 15 - 350 kev band of @xmath20 erg @xmath21 , and redshift 1.29 ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "the average spectral index @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) during the burst was @xmath24 and during the x - ray afterglow , the spectral index was @xmath25 and the lc fell off as @xmath26 .",
    "we describe the results for @xmath0-ray and x - ray emissions below .",
    "_ gamma - ray generation via the synchrotron process _    figure 1 shows the parameter space allowed  for a source radiating via the synchrotron process  to explain the observed @xmath0-ray data for 050126 .",
    "in particular we show the allowed range for @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath27 ( the lower limit to the lorentz factor of unshocked shell which produced the @xmath0-ray photons when it was shock heated  we will refer to it as shell 1 ) , and the upper limit to the lorentz factor of the shell or the medium that shell 1 collided with ( @xmath28 ) ; the figure caption describes how @xmath27 and @xmath28 are calculated .",
    "these quantities are plotted against the radius , @xmath29 , at which @xmath0-rays are generated , to determine which grb model could be described by the four parameter solution space .",
    "the solutions we find have @xmath30 , and a high magnetic field strength is needed to explain the @xmath0-ray emission for this burst if it were to arise due to synchrotron emission . the synchrotron cooling frequency is found to be less than a few ev which is in part due to the constraint that the low energy spectral index is -0.34@xmath31 ( so all of the solutions are in highly radiative cooling regime ) .",
    "the radius where the observed @xmath0-rays could have been generated varies from the typical internal shock radius of @xmath32 cm to the external shock radius of @xmath33 cm ; the lower limit to the radius is due to our choice of @xmath34 in order to avoid excessive compton scattering  for @xmath35 the minimum @xmath29 is a factor 2 smaller . in the case of internal shocks",
    "we find that the lorentz factor of the two colliding shells must satisfy the condition @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , which seems an unrealistic requirement for any central engine to meet , and in any case this situation would not be that different from the interaction of grb ejecta with the ism where @xmath38 . note that the time interval between the ejection of the two shells ( with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) is larger than 500s for the internal shock radius of @xmath41 cm while the duration of this burst was 25s  this is another problem for this solution .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the grb lc was a fred ( fast rise , exponential decline ) means that internal shocks are not required to generate the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the allowed parameter space contains an external forward - shock solution as well ( @xmath42 cm ; @xmath38 ) .",
    "this solution , however , requires @xmath43 ( figure 1 ) which makes the already acute problem of baryonic loading much worse .",
    "moreover , the deceleration radius for this large @xmath6 , for a typical grb - circumstellar medium density of @xmath44 @xmath45 , is less than @xmath46 cm  the distance at which the @xmath0-ray source according to our solution is located . therefore , we conclude that @xmath0-rays from 050126 are unlikely to have been produced via the synchrotron process in internal or external shocks .",
    "-ray source from the center of explosion . shown in the figure is the minimum energy of electrons divided by the rest mass ( @xmath11 ) at the location where these particles are accelerated in the source , i.e. , where radiative losses are unimportant .",
    "also shown are the comoving magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) in gauss , the lorentz factor ( lf ) of the unshocked shells / medium  @xmath27 & @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath47 is the lf of the inner unshocked shell ; where @xmath48 is the minimum lf of the shock front wrt the unshocked shell  this assumes that electrons have the same energy as protons ( @xmath49 will be larger if electrons have lower energy )  and @xmath6 is the lf of the shocked material as seen by a lab frame observer .",
    "@xmath28 is the lf of the unshocked outer shell / medium and is given by : @xmath50 .",
    "the calculations of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are valid when the @xmath0-ray producing shell / medium is the inner and the outer shell respectively , and they are also valid for most internal shell collision situations where the shock front speed in the two shells is about the same . for these calculations we took @xmath51 erg , @xmath16 , @xmath52 , and the flux at 150kev at the peak of the @xmath0-ray lc ( 7s ) to be 0.2mjy .",
    "we use a factor of 2 tolerance in all of the observational data such as @xmath0-ray flux , burst duration etc . in constructing the acceptable solution parameter space.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      figure 2 shows the allowed parameter space for synchrotron - self - ic solutions .",
    "the entire solution space consists of mildly relativistic shocks with @xmath53 , and the lorentz factor ( lf ) of the source is between 20 & 300 .",
    "mildly relativistic shocks arise naturally in internal collisions ( with the ratio of lfs for colliding shells of order a few ) and the external reverse - shock ( rs ) .",
    "a good fraction of the allowed parameter space has electron cooling time , due to radiative losses , of order the dynamical time or less , and the synchrotron cooling frequency is of order a few ev .",
    "the magnetic field strength is about 50 gauss ( which corresponds to @xmath54 ) & compton y @xmath55 for the part of parameter space corresponding to reverse - shocks , whereas @xmath4 is between 1 and 10@xmath56 gauss and @xmath57 for internal shocks",
    ". the ic @xmath0-ray lightcurve falls off very rapidly for both the internal and the reverse shock emission as does the observed lc ( kobayashi et al .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-rays from grb050126 could have been produced via ssc in either internal or external shocks , and we do nt see any reason to prefer one solution over the other for this burst .",
    "is it possible that the early x - ray afterglow was produced by the same source as the grb ic photons ?",
    "the ic cooling frequency , @xmath58 , at the grb lc peak ( 7s ) is typically of order a few hundred kev for the allowed parameter space for this burst . since @xmath59 shifts to lower energies due to adiabatic cooling , as @xmath60 , at 100s it will have dropped to @xmath31 kev . in this case",
    "the flux in the xrt band at 100s from @xmath61 part of the source will be very small , and will rapidly drop to zero on a short time scale .",
    "the early x - ray lc could be explained by this adiabatically cooling @xmath0-ray source provided that @xmath62 mev at 7 s , which is somewhat outside of the parameter space we find for this burst",
    ".    could photons detected by the xrt in 0.2 - 10 kev band at @xmath63s be off - axis photons ( kumar & panaitescu , 2000 ) that originate at the source at an angle w.r.t . the line of sight @xmath64 ?",
    "the flux at 10 kev at the peak of the grb 050126 lightcurve was 0.54@xmath65mjy .",
    "this gives the flux , see [ 11 ] , where @xmath22 is the spectral index , i.e. @xmath66 . ] at 100s due to off axis emission of 1.1@xmath67jy , in rough agreement with the xrt measurement of 2.8@xmath68jy .",
    "the x - ray light - curve between 100s and 425s declined as @xmath69 .",
    "this decline is also consistent with that expected of off - axis emission ; @xmath70 during this period would give rise to off - axis lc decaying as @xmath71 .",
    "the spectral peak for the off - axis emission from a uniform jet decreases with time as @xmath72 , and so the peak at 100s is at @xmath44kev .",
    "the peak frequency decreases more rapidly when electron energy and/or magnetic field is smaller at higher @xmath73 . in this case",
    "the spectral peak will be below 10 kev , and @xmath22 in the xrt band , for @xmath63s , smaller than during the grb .",
    "we note that a decrease of @xmath11 and @xmath4 would not lead to a decrease in the flux in the xrt band so long as these changes are accompanied with an increase in the number of radiating particles as might be expected , for instance , when @xmath6 decreases with @xmath73 but the energy per unit solid angle is roughly constant .",
    "the angular structure of the ejecta can be constrained by the difference between the observed spectral peak at 100s and during the burst .    , @xmath6 ( the lorentz factor of @xmath0-ray source ) , and @xmath4 ( the comoving magnetic field strength in gauss ) .",

    "the solutions with @xmath75 cm have @xmath76 and are physically unacceptable since the energy in the 2nd compton scattering will be of order 10@xmath77erg which is too large to obtain from a stellar mass object .",
    "therefore , the only viable solution for the @xmath0-ray emission is ic in the external reverse - shock .",
    "we took @xmath78 erg , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , the peak of the spectrum at 90kev , and the flux at the peak of the @xmath0-ray lc ( 15s ) at 90kev to be 1.2mjy .",
    "we applied the condition that @xmath8190 kev ; this automatically ensures that @xmath82 as observed .",
    "we use a factor of 2 tolerance in all of the observational data such as @xmath0-ray flux , burst duration , the peak frequency etc . in constructing the acceptable solution parameter space.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      grb 050219a was 23.6s long with fluence in the bat 15 - 350 kev band of @xmath83 erg @xmath21 .",
    "the average spectral index @xmath22 during the burst was @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , and the peak of the spectrum was at 90@xmath86 kev ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ) . during the x - ray afterglow ,",
    "the spectral index was @xmath87 and the x - ray lc declined as @xmath88 .",
    "we describe below the mechanism for @xmath0-ray , x - ray , and optical emissions .",
    "the positive @xmath22 during the grb , although consistent with the synchrotron spectrum of @xmath89 to within 1.5@xmath90 , rules out the synchrotron process for the generation of @xmath0-rays for 050219a .",
    "the reason is that the magnetic field required to produce synchrotron peak frequency of 90kev is sufficiently strong that electrons lose their energy on a time scale much less than the duration of the burst ( 23s ) , and in this case the spectrum below 90 kev would be @xmath91 .",
    "and the electron cooling lf is @xmath92 ; the compton parameter @xmath93 , and therefore , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the burst duration in the host galaxy rest frame . since @xmath96and @xmath97s , and @xmath98",
    ", we see that @xmath99 unless @xmath100 which is highly unlikely . ]",
    "this is in conflict with the observed spectrum and rules out the synchrotron process for @xmath0-ray generation .",
    "the inverse - compton process on the other hand provides a very natural way of explaining the observed spectrum and other properties .",
    "the spectrum produced by inverse compton scattering of a self - absorbed synchrotron radiation is @xmath101 for @xmath102 ; where @xmath103 is the synchrotron self - absorption frequency . for @xmath104 and @xmath105ev ,",
    "the peak of the ic spectrum at @xmath106 is close to the observed value of 90@xmath1079 kev .",
    "these parameters arise naturally in an external reverse - shock .",
    "figure 3 shows the allowed parameter space for ssc solution for grb 050219a , assuming @xmath80 .",
    "the range of @xmath11 for the allowed solutions is 2001500 which is typical for the external reverse - shock and for internal shocks , but not the external forward - shock .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath4 is between 0.1 and 20 gauss .",
    "this is highly sub - equipartition ( @xmath108 ) , and therefore for 050219a we can rule out the possibility that the @xmath0-ray burst was produced as a result of dissipation of magnetic field or that much of the energy of the explosion was carried outward by the magnetic field .",
    "the compton y is rather large  of order 10100 for external shock ( @xmath109 cm ) , and larger than 10@xmath110 for internal shock radius of @xmath111 cm ( fig .",
    "3 ) . one might suspect that the large @xmath74 renders these solutions unphysical since the energy in the 2nd compton scattering , which produces @xmath112100 gev photons , will far exceed the @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "however , for low optical depth systems with @xmath113 the radius of the system increases by about a factor 2 in the time it takes photons to traverse the shell .",
    "therefore , the optical depth for the 2nd scattering is smaller than the 1st by a factor 4 , and the electron thermal energy has decreased due to adiabatic expansion during this period by a factor of about 4 for rs ( shell thickness for rs increases as @xmath114 ) , and a factor 2 for internal shocks .",
    "thus , the effective @xmath74 for the 2nd compton scattering is smaller than the 1st scattering compton - y by a factor of about 64 for the rs and 16 for internal shocks . for this reason @xmath115 for the external shock is quite acceptable , as the total energy requirement is of order 10@xmath116 erg .",
    "however , @xmath117 for internal shocks ( see fig .",
    "3 ) would require the total energy in the explosion to be @xmath118 times larger than energy in the @xmath0-ray band and that is highly unlikely considering that @xmath119 erg .",
    "therefore , the only viable solution for the @xmath0-ray production for 050219a is inverse - compton in the external reverse - shock heated ejecta .",
    "there are two mechanisms that can explain the x - ray observations for this burst .",
    "one of these is the off - axis emission .",
    "the flux at the peak of @xmath0-ray lc ( 15s ) at 10kev was @xmath120jy . using this and @xmath121 , we find the flux at 100s , due to the off - axis emission mechanism ( @xmath122 ) , to be @xmath123jy , which is consistent with the observed xrt flux ( @xmath124jy at 10 kev at 100s ) .",
    "the lc decay according to the off - axis emission after the spectral peak falls through the xrt band is @xmath125 , where @xmath87 is the spectral index for @xmath63s , and this is consistent with the observed decay of @xmath88 .",
    "the difference between the x - ray afterglow and @xmath0-ray spectra can be understood in the same way as discussed for 050126 , i.e. the peak of @xmath126 during the grb ( 90kev ) is well below 10kev at 100s if @xmath11 and @xmath4 decrease with @xmath73 slightly and this changes the spectrum from @xmath127 to @xmath128 . due to the off axis emission . ]",
    "the second possibility is that we continue to see radiation from within @xmath129 angle of the adiabatically cooling @xmath0-ray source .",
    "we find that for a large part of the allowed parameter space for @xmath0-ray solution @xmath130mev , and therefore we expect to receive emission in the 0.2 - 10 kev band for a period of about 5 minutes , during which time the flux decline will be @xmath131 , which is consistent with the observed decay .",
    ", so the 90 kev peak at 15s would have shifted to 2 kev at 100s . during the time when this peak is above the xrt band of 10kev , the ic flux from the rs decreases very weakly with time ( @xmath132 ) , and subsequently , the flux decreases as @xmath133 .",
    "the cross - over is expected at about 45s .",
    "thus , the flux from the rs at 100s at 10 kev is expected to be about @xmath134jy which is consistent with the xrt flux of 25@xmath135jy .",
    "the spectrum at 100s will be as expected of ic above @xmath106 , i.e. roughly @xmath136 .",
    "] we note that the discontinuity in the bat and xrt lightcurves for this burst@xmath137 could be due to an underestimation of the spectral evolution in 20 - 50s time interval where the bat signal was low .",
    "a discontinuous jump can also arise in the off - axis model as a result of a rapid increase in jet energy for @xmath73 between @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "both of these solutions suggest a common source for the @xmath0-ray burst and early x - rays .      the optical flux at 100s from the @xmath0-ray source is shown in figure 3 .",
    "for the rs solution the flux is about 1 mjy whereas the observed uvot upper limit at 96s is 0.02mjy ( schady et al .",
    ". the much smaller optical flux could be due to absorption in the host galaxy .",
    "the total hydrogen column density for this burst was@xmath137 @xmath140 @xmath21 , in excess of the galactic value , which for a burst at @xmath141 could give @xmath37mag of optical extinction , more than sufficient to bring the optical flux below the observed upper limit . and extinction might not apply to grbs due to possible dust destruction by grb emission ( galama & wijers , 2001 ) .",
    "it is therefore difficult to say with confidence the amount of extinction for this burst in the v - band . ] alternatively , if the rs occurs at @xmath142 cm the optical flux would be roughly consistent with the observed upper limit ( see fig .",
    "however , in this case @xmath143 , and the energy in the 2nd compton scattered , photons , at 100 gev , will be almost an order of magnitude larger than the energy in @xmath0-rays .",
    "we find that the prompt @xmath0-ray and early ( first few minutes ) x - ray emissions for grbs 050126 and 050219a are consistent with being produced by the same source . in the case of 050126 ,",
    "the emission is inverse compton radiation from either internal shocks or external - reverse shock , and in the case of 050219a , the photons are produced by inverse compton in the external - reverse shock .",
    "the late time x - ray ( @xmath144min ) is produced , as usual , in the forward shock .",
    "these results can be applied to the class of gamma - ray bursts with consist of a simple , i.e. not highly variable , lightcurve .",
    "for instance , our conclusion that @xmath0-rays were generated via the inverse - compton process for grb 050219a is valid for all those grbs which , like grb 050219a , have a positive low energy spectral index for the prompt gamma - ray emission ( @xmath145 with @xmath146 ) .",
    "the allowed values for parameters  @xmath4 , @xmath6 & @xmath11  for the source of @xmath0-rays for any grb consisting of a single peak in the @xmath0-ray lightcurve should be similar to that shown in figures 1 and 3 for 050126 & 050219a .",
