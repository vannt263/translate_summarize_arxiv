    "langevin dynamics@xcite is a modeling technique , in which the motion of a set of massive bodies in the presence of a bath of smaller solvent particles is directly integrated , while the dynamics of the solvent are `` averaged out '' .",
    "this approximation may lead to a dramatic reduction in computational cost compared to `` explicit solvent '' methods , since dynamics of the solvent particles no longer need to be fully resolved .",
    "with langevin dynamics , the effect of the solvent is reduced to an instantaneous drag force and a random delta - correlated force felt by the massive bodies .",
    "this framework has been applied in a variety of scenarios , including implicit solvents,@xcite brownian dynamics,@xcite dynamic thermostats,@xcite and the stabilization of time integrators.@xcite    in spite of the numerous successes of conventional langevin dynamics it has long been recognized that there are physically compelling scenarios in which the underlying assumptions break down , necessitating a more general treatment.@xcite to this end , generalized langevin dynamics ( gld ) permits the modeling of systems in which the inertial gap separating the massive bodies from the smaller solvent particles is reduced . here",
    "the assumptions of an instantaneous drag force and a delta - correlated random force become insufficient , leading to the introduction of a temporally non - local drag and a random force with non - trivial correlations .",
    "gld has historically been applied to numerous problems over the years,@xcite with a number of new applications inspiring a resurgence of interest , including microrheology,@xcite biological systems,@xcite nuclear quantum effects,@xcite and other situations in which anomalous diffusion arises.@xcite    to facilitate computational exploration of some of these applications , a number of authors have developed numerical integration schemes for the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) , either in isolation or in conjunction with extra terms accounting for external or pairwise forces as would be required in a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation .",
    "these schemes must deal with a number of complications if they are to remain computationally efficient and accurate .",
    "* the retarded drag force takes the form of a convolution of the velocity with a memory kernel .",
    "this requires the storage of the velocity history , and the numerical evaluation of a convolution at each time step , which can become computationally expensive .",
    "* the generation of a random force with non - trivial correlations may also require the storage of a sequence of random numbers , and some additional computational expense incurred at each time step .",
    "numerous methods exist that circumvent either one or both of these difficulties.@xcite each has a different computational cost , implementation complexity , order of convergence , and specific features , e.g. , some are restricted to single exponential memory kernels , require linear algebra , etc . to this end",
    ", it is difficult to distinguish any individual method as being optimal , especially given the broad range of applications to which gld may be applied .",
    "motivated by the aforementioned applications and previous work in numerical integrators , we have developed a new family of time integration schemes for the gle in the presence of conservative forces , and implemented it in a public domain md code , lammps.@xcite our primary impetus was to enable the development of reduced order models for nanocolloidal suspensions , among a variety of other applications outlined above .",
    "previous computational studies of these systems using explicit solvents have demonstrated and resolved a number of associated computational challenges .",
    "@xcite our method enables a complementary framework for the modeling of these types of systems using implicit solvents that can include memory effects . otherwise , to date the gle has only been solved in the presence of a number of canonically tractable external potentials and memory kernels.@xcite integration into the lammps framework , provides a number of capabilities .",
    "lammps includes a broad array of external , bonded , and non - bonded potentials , yielding the possibility for the numerical exploration of more complex systems than have been previously studied .",
    "finally , lammps provides a highly scalable parallel platform for studying n - body dynamics .",
    "consequently , extremely large sample statistics are readily accessible even in the case of interacting particles , for which parallelism is an otherwise non - trivial problem .    in this paper , details germane to both the development of our time integration scheme , as well as specifics of its implementation are presented .",
    "the time integration scheme to be discussed is based upon a two - parameter family of methods specialized to an extended variable formulation of the gle .",
    "some of the salient advantages of our formulation and the final time integration scheme are :    * generalizability to a wide array of memory kernels representable by a positive prony series , such as power laws . * efficiency afforded by an extended variable formulation that obviates the explicit evaluation of time convolutions . * inexpensive treatment of correlated random forces , free of linear algebra , requiring only one random force evaluation per extended variable per timestep .",
    "* exact conservation of the first and second moments of either the integrated velocity distribution or position distribution , for harmonically confined and free particles .",
    "* numerically stable approach to the langevin limit of the gle .",
    "* simplicity of implementation into an existing verlet md framework .",
    "the specialization to prony - representable memory kernels is worth noting , as there is a growing body of literature concerning this form of the gle.@xcite a number of results have been presented that establish the mathematical well - posedness of this extended variable gle including a term accounting for smooth conservative forces , as may arise in md.@xcite these results include proofs of ergodicity and exponential convergence to a measure , as well as a discussion of the langevin limit of the gle in which the parameters of the extended system generate conventional langevin dynamics .",
    "one somewhat unique feature of our framework is that we are analyzing the gle using methods from stochastic calculus . in particular , we focus on weak convergence in the construction our method , i.e. , error in representing the moments of the stationary distribution or the distribution itself .",
    "the optimal parametrization of our two - parameter family of methods will be defined in terms of achieving accuracy with respect to this type of convergence . in particular , the optimal method that has been implemented achieves exactness in the first and second moments of the integrated velocity distribution for harmonically confined and free particles .",
    "few authors have considered this type of analysis for even conventional langevin integrators , with a notable exception being wang and skeel,@xcite who have carried out weak error analysis for a number of integrators used in conventional langevin dynamics . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that such a weak analysis has been carried out for a gle integrator . we hope that these considerations will contribute to a better understanding of existing and future methods .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows :    * * section [ problem_statement ] * introduces the mathematical details of the gle . * * section [ extended_variable_formalism ] * presents the extended variable formulation and its benefits . *",
    "* section [ numerical_integration_of_the_gle ] * develops the theory associated with integrating the extended variable gle in terms of a two - parameter family of methods . * * section [ error_analysis ] * provides details of the error analysis that establishes the ` optimal ' method among this family . * * section [ multistage_splitting ] * discusses the extension of our method to a multi - stage splitting framework .",

    "we are interested in solving equation  [ cont_gle ] for both @xmath19 and @xmath20 at a set of @xmath21 uniformly spaced discrete points in time . to this end",
    ", we seek to construct a solution scheme that is mindful of the following complications :    * calculation of the temporally non - local drag force requires a convolution with @xmath15 , and thusly the storage of some subset of the time history of @xmath20 .",

    "is a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , we are not concerned with issues of local or global error , but rather that the integrated solution converges in distribution .",
    "to circumvent the first two complications , we work with an extended variable formalism@xcite in which we assume that @xmath15 is representable as a prony series : @xmath22 , \\quad t\\geq 0.\\ ] ] as will be demonstrated in section  [ extended_variable_formalism ] , this form of the memory kernel will allow us to map the non - markovian form of the gle in equation  [ cont_gle ] onto a higher - dimensional markovian problem with @xmath23 extended variables per particle .",
    "the third complication is resolved in sections  [ numerical_integration_of_the_gle ] and [ error_analysis ] , in which a family of integrators is derived , and then ` optimal ' parameters are selected based upon an error analysis of the moments of the integrated velocity .",
    "we introduce the extended variable formalism in two stages .",
    "first , we define a set of extended variables that allow for an effectively convolution - free reformulation of equation [ cont_gle ] .",
    "then , we demonstrate that the non - trivial temporal correlations required of @xmath14 can be effected through coupling to an auxiliary set of ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) processes .",
    "we begin by defining the extended variable , @xmath24 , associated with the @xmath25th prony mode s action on the @xmath26th component of @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath27 v_i(s ) ds\\ ] ] component - wise , equation [ cont_gle ] can now be rewritten as :    [ ext_gle_1 ] @xmath28    rather than relying upon the integral form of equation [ ext_var_def ] to update the value of @xmath24 , we consider the total differential of @xmath24 to generate an equation of motion that takes the form of a simple sde : @xmath29 now , the system of equations [ ext_gle_1 ] and [ ext_var_eom ] can be resolved for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath24 without requiring the explicit evaluation of a convolution integral .",
    "next , we seek a means of constructing random forces that obey the fdt , as in equation [ fdt ] . to this end , we consider the following sde : @xmath32 if @xmath33 is a standard wiener process , this sde defines an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process , @xmath34 .",
    "using established properties of the ou process,@xcite we can see that @xmath34 has mean zero and two - time correlation : @xmath35 , \\quad s\\geq 0\\ ] ] it is then clear , that the random force in equation [ cont_gle ] can be rewritten as : @xmath36 here each individual contribution is generated by a standard ou process , the discrete - time version of which is the ar(1 ) process . while we are still essentially forced to generate a sequence of correlated random numbers , mapping onto a set of ar(1 ) processes has the advantage of requiring the retention of but a single prior value in generating each subsequent value .",
    "further , standard gaussian random number generators can be employed .    combining both results ,",
    "the final extended variable gle can be expressed in terms of the composite variable , @xmath37 :    [ ext_gle_2 ] @xmath38    it is for this system of equations that we will construct a numerical integration scheme in section  [ numerical_integration_of_the_gle ] .",
    "it is worth noting that other authors have rigorously shown that this extended variable form of the gle converges to the langevin equation in the limit of small @xmath39.@xcite informally , this can be seen by multplying the @xmath40 equation by @xmath39 , and taking the limit as @xmath39 goes to zero , which results in @xmath41 inserting this expression into the equation for @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 which is a conventional langevin equation .",
    "we have been careful to preserve this limit in our numerical integration scheme , and will explicitly demonstrate this theoretically and numerically .",
    "we consider a family of numerical integration schemes for the system in equation [ ext_gle_2 ] assuming a uniform timestep , @xmath44 .",

    "for consistency , we require that @xmath59    for the remainder of this article , we restrict our attention three different methods , each of which corresponds to a different choice for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    *",

    "a similar approach has been used for the classical langevin equation.@xcite the extended variable gle for this system converges to a distribution of the form @xmath68\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the usual normalization constant . from this",

    "@xmath71 @xmath72    next , we consider the discrete - time process generated by our numerical integrators , and show that the moments of its stationary distribution converge to the analytic ones in @xmath44 . @xmath73",
    "the stationary distribution of this process is defined by the time independence of its first moments @xmath74 enforcing these identities , it can be shown that @xmath75 hence , the first moments are correctly computed by the numerical method for any choice of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . computing the second moments , we obtain @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 from this analysis",
    ", we conclude that we obtain the correct second moment for @xmath81 for any method with @xmath82 .",

    "the error in the variance of @xmath81 is second - order in @xmath44 .",
    "all three methods overestimate the variance of @xmath88 , with an error which is second - order in @xmath44 .",
    "the error in the variance of @xmath89 is first - order for method 1 , and second - order for methods 2 and 3 .",
    "it is possible to choose @xmath76 and @xmath77 to obtain the exact variance for @xmath88 , but this would require using a different value for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for each value of @xmath65 .",
    "this is not useful in our framework , since the method is applied to problems with general nonlinear interaction forces .",
    "we would like our numerical method to be stable for a wide range of values for @xmath39 . as we mentioned in section  [ extended_variable_formalism ]",
    ", the gle converges to the conventional langevin equation as @xmath39 goes to zero , and we would like our numerical method to have a similar property . for fixed @xmath44 , both methods 1 and 2 are unstable ( @xmath90 is unbounded ) as @xmath39 goes to zero .",
    "however , method 3 does not suffer from the same problem , with @xmath91 converging to zero and @xmath90 bounded .",
    "from this analysis , we conclude that method 3 is the best choice for implementation .",
    "prior to providing implementation details , however , we briefly consider a simple multistage extension that can capture the exact first and second moments of position and velocity simultaneously at the expense of introducing a numerical correlation between them .      inspired by the work of leimkuhler and matthews,@xcite we consider a generalization of the splitting method considered in section  [ numerical_integration_of_the_gle ] in which the position and velocity updates are further split , @xmath92 in the special case that @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 , the two updates of @xmath88 can be combined , and we recover our original splitting method .    repeating the analysis in section  [ error_analysis ] for the harmonic oscillator with a single memory term , we find @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 in the special case that @xmath99 , we can simplify these expressions to obtain @xmath100 @xmath101 from this analysis , we conclude that we obtain the correct second moment for @xmath88 for any method with @xmath99 and @xmath82 .",
    "to guarantee the correct second moment for @xmath81 , the choice of @xmath76 and @xmath77 becomes @xmath65 dependent . as was discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the parameters prescribed by methods 1 and 3 using the original splitting have a similar behavior but with the roles of @xmath88 and @xmath81 reversed .",
    "it is then tempting to formulate a method that exactly preserves the second moments of both @xmath88 and @xmath81 at the same time .",
    "it turns out that this is possible by simply shifting where we observe @xmath81 , using either @xmath102 or @xmath103 in the multistage splitting method above .",
    "for example , consider the following asymmetric method , with @xmath99 , @xmath104 for this method we obtain , @xmath105 @xmath106 if we use a method with @xmath82 , we find that we obtain the exact moments for @xmath88 and @xmath81 , but we have introduced an @xmath107 correlation between @xmath88 and @xmath81 .",
    "this is in contrast to the symmetric methods where this correlation is identically zero .",
    "method 3 , as detailed in section [ error_analysis ] has been implemented in the lammps software package .",
    "it can be applied in conjunction with all conservative force fields supported by lammps .",
    "there are a number of details of our implementation worth remarking on concerning random number generation , initial conditions on the extended variables , and the conservation of total linear momentum .",
    "the numerical integration scheme requires the generation of gaussian random numbers , by way of @xmath108 in equation [ s_update ] . by default ,",
    "all random numbers are drawn from a uniform distribution with the same mean and variance as the formally required gaussian distribution .",
    "this distribution is chosen to avoid the generation of numbers that are arbitrarily large , or more accurately , arbitrarily close to the floating point limit .",
    "the generation of such large numbers may lead to rare motions that result in the loss of atoms from a periodic simulation box , even at low temperatures .",
    "atom loss occurs if , within a single time step , the change in one or more of an atom s position coordinates is updated to a value that results in it being placed outside of the simulation box after periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "a uniform distribution can be used to guarantee that this will not happen for a given temperature and time step . however , for the sake of mathematical rigor , the option remains at compile - time to enable the use of the proper gaussian distribution with the caveat that such spurious motions may occur .",
    "should the use of this random number generator produce a trajectory in which atom loss occurs , a simple practical correction may be to use a different seed and/or a different time step in a subsequent simulation .",
    "it is worth noting that the choice of a uniform random number distribution has been rigorously justified by dnweg and paul@xcite for a number of canonical random processes , including one described by a conventional langevin equation .",
    "we anticipate that a similar result may hold for the extended variable gle presented in this manuscript .",
    "with respect to the initialization of the extended variables , it is frequently the case in md that initial conditions are drawn from the equilibrium distribution at some initial temperature .",
    "details of the equilibrium distribution for the extended system are presented in section 2 of an article by ottobre and pavliotis.@xcite in our implementation , we provide the option to initialize the extended variables either based upon this distribution , or with zero initial conditions ( i.e. , the extended system at zero temperature ) . as it is typically more relevant for md simulations ,",
    "the former is enabled by default and used in the generation of the results in this paper .",
    "conservation of the total linear momentum of a system is frequently a desirable feature for md trajectories . for deterministic forces",
    ", this can be guaranteed to high precision through the subtraction of the velocity of the center of mass from all particles at a single time step . in the presence of random forces such as those arising in gld",
    ", a similar adjustment must be made at each time step to prevent the center of mass from undergoing a random acceleration . while it is not enabled by default",
    ", our implementation provides such a mechanism that can be activated .",
    "when active , the average of the forces acting on all extended variables is subtracted from each individual extended variable at each time step . while this is a computationally inexpensive adjustment , it may not be essential for all simulations .",
    "throughout this section , results will be presented , primarily in terms of the integrated velocity autocorrelation function ( vaf ) .",

    "we again emphasize that methods 1 and 2 , considered earlier , will not stably approach this limit .    to demonstrate capability in reduced order modeling , we next invert the vaf associated with a set of trajectories generated in the presence of a conservative force , to construct a memory kernel that will reproduce the same dynamics without such a force .",
    "in other words , we seek an effective memory kernel , @xmath139 , such that a simplified gle of the form : @xmath140 reproduces the vaf of a gle of the more general form given in equation [ cont_gle ] .    the starting point for this procedure",
    "is the observation that for equation [ force_free_gle ] , the vaf and memory kernel have the following relationship in the laplace domain:@xcite @xmath141 here , tildes indicate that the associated time domain quantities have been laplace transformed , with transform domain variable @xmath142 .",
    "given @xmath143 for some process whose vaf we wish to reproduce via integration of equation [ force_free_gle ] , @xmath144 can be resolved algebraically , and its time domain form can be found via an inverse laplace transform : @xmath145 this effective memory kernel can then be fit to a prony series , and equation [ force_free_gle ] can be integrated using the numerical method developed in this manuscript . in figure [ harmonic_kernel_fit ] , we demonstrate that we can use this inversion procedure to take the exact vaf generated by equation [ harmonic_gle ] , and compute a @xmath139 for equation [ force_free_gle ] that reproduces it :    .",
    "note that while the exact vaf evolves under the influence of a harmonic confining potential ( equation [ harmonic_gle ] ) , the integrated vaf is spawned by a gle free of any conservative forces ( equation [ force_free_gle ] ) .",
    "the effect of the force is included in the construction of @xmath139 .",
    "[ harmonic_kernel_fit],title=\"fig : \" ]    here , the parameters utilized in equation [ harmonic_gle ] were @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and the associated analytic vaf was fit to a three term prony series .",
    "this initial fit was done to realize a simpler form of the laplace domain vaf , which was inserted into equation [ kernel_fit_eqn ] .",
    "the resultant @xmath139 was also fit to a three term prony series .",
    "it is interesting to note that one term of this fit reduced to a conventional langevin term ( i.e. , one that was proportional to @xmath148 rather than @xmath149 $ ] ) highlighting the utility of our method s reproduction of the langevin limit .",
    "this prony series representation of @xmath139 was used in equation [ force_free_gle ] , which was numerically integrated to yield the integrated vaf result in figure [ harmonic_kernel_fit ] .",
    "this result is especially interesting as it demonstrates capability for effecting a confining potential , on a finite timescale , exclusively through the gle drag / random forces .",
    "this same fitting procedure could be used to remove inter - particle interactions , albeit with some loss of dynamical information , and will be discussed in more detail in future work .",
    "it is important to note that while the dynamics of a confined particle are reproduced in the absence of an explicit confining force , this is only the case over the interval for which the memory kernel is reconstructed . outside of this interval , the asymptotic behavior of the prony series memory kernel will give rise to unbounded diffusive motion . while the expected discrepancies in the dynamics are difficult to notice in the vaf , as both the analytic and reconstructed quantities decay to zero , it is very evident in the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) . here",
    "the asymptotic exponential behavior of the prony series memory kernel necessarily leads to asymptotic diffusive motion signaled by a linear msd .",
    "in contrast , the analytic memory kernel with the confining force will generate an msd that remains bounded .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ harmonic_msd_comparison ] . here , the fit vaf is integrated to yield the msd for the prony series model , and compared with the exact msd over both the interval of the fit , and beyond .",
    "this example illustrates the importance of choosing an appropriate interval for fitting memory kernels to achieve the appropriate limiting behavior in one s dynamics .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "a family of numerical integration schemes for gld have been presented .",
    "these schemes are based upon an extended variable formulation of the gle in which the memory kernel is rendered as a positive prony series . in certain limits",
    ", it can be shown that a specific instance of this family of integrators exactly conserves the first and second moments of the integrated velocity distribution , and stably approaches the langevin limit . to this end",
    ", we identify this parametrization as optimal , and have implemented it in the md code , lammps .",
    "numerical experiments indicate that this implementation is robust for a number of canonical problems , as well as certain pathologies in the memory kernel .",
    "an exemplary application to reduced order modeling illustrates potential uses of this module for md practitioners .",
    "future work will further develop the vaf fitting procedure in the context of statistical inference methods , and present extensions of the numerical integrator to mixed sign and complex memory kernels .",
