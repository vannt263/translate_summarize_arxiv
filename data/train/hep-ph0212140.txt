    "a multi - tev @xmath0 linear collider ( lc ) is expected to complete the investigation of the susy particle spectrum , in the case supersymmetry is realised in nature and the particle partners exhibit a mass spectrum extending up to 1  tev , and beyond . in this case",
    ", precise determinations of the masses and widths of these particles will represent a central part of the collider physics programme .",
    "sets of susy benchmarks have recently been proposed , which take into account constraints from direct searches at lep-2 and other colliders and data from @xmath2 and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "most of these benchmarks have the masses of the heaviest sparticles beyond the reach of the lhc and of a tev - class @xmath0 linear collider .",
    "the lhc is expected to reveal the existence of supersymmetry and perform a study of the sparticle properties in the vast majority of conceivable scenarios and a 0.5 - 1.0  tev @xmath0 collider can improve the accuracy in the study of the lightest susy states . however , higher energies are likely to be needed to access all the sparticles species and acquire the data necessary to clarify the nature of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "a first mapping of the potential of a 3 - 5  tev @xmath0 collider , such as clic  @xcite , in comparison to the lhc and to a lower energy @xmath0 collider was performed , based on a simple assumption on the minimum observable product of production cross section and decay branching fraction into well reconstructable final states  @xcite . beyond detection ,",
    "it is important to assess the ability of clic to perform accurate determinations of sparticle masses , widths and decay branching fractions , taking into account the details of beam - beam interactions and the resulting luminosity spectrum and accelerator - induced backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "we study here the expected clic accuracy on sfermion masses , using a realistic simulation .",
    "results are presented for the supersymmetric partner of the muon , @xmath3 and for the scalar top , @xmath4 .",
    "section  2 presents the benchmarks considered and the clic parameters .",
    "there are two different techniques for the determination of the smuon mass : the analysis of the energy distribution of the resulting muon in the two body @xmath3 decay and the energy scan close the the production threshold .",
    "these are discussed in 3.1 and 3.2 respectively . in section  4",
    "we discuss the perspectives for extending the energy spectrum analysis to @xmath4 decays and section 5 has the conclusions .",
    "the post - lep cmssm benchmark points e and h , proposed in  @xcite , have been chosen for this study .",
    "point e   = 300 , @xmath5 = 1500 , @xmath6 = 10 , @xmath7 = + , @xmath8 = 0 ] is representative of the focus region , characterised by heavy sleptons and squarks .",
    "the @xmath9 threshold is just accessible at @xmath103  tev .",
    "the gluino ( @xmath11=697  gev ) being lighter than the squarks , decays such as @xmath12 are open for these parameters .",
    "it is interesting to observe that such inverted scenario , with the gluino lighter than the squarks , is also common to benchmarks inspired to effective field theories derived from strings  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the lsp is 120  gev and those of the heavier neutralinos are in the range 200 - 300  gev .",
    "point h   = 1500 , @xmath5 = 419 , @xmath6 = 20 , @xmath7 = + , @xmath8 = 0 ] is located at the end - point of the coannihilation tail at large @xmath13 and moderate @xmath6 .",
    "the heavy sparticle spectrum makes this a highly problematic point at the lhc .",
    "however , at @xmath14=3  tev , smuons are accessible in @xmath0 collisions and their masses can be determined through the muon energy distribution .",
    "the lsp mass , @xmath15 , is 665  gev .",
    "events have been simulated using the pythia 6.2 monte carlo generator .",
    "parameters have been tuned to reproduce sparticles masses and widths to a good accuracy .",
    "initial state radiation ( isr ) has been included .",
    "muon energy distributions have been obtained using full geant-3 simulation of a discrete silicon tracker consisting of twelve layers located from 3.5  cm up to 180  cm in radius and a solenoidal magnetic field @xmath16 of either 4 or 6  t. backgrounds and @xmath17 decays have been processed using the simdet parametric simulation  @xcite , describing the detector response determined using geant .",
    "the clic luminosity spectrum has been folded to the production cross sections using the calypso interface . @xmath18 and",
    "parallel muon backgrounds have been overlayed to the generated signal and background events for the smuon study .",
    "._main properties of the sparticles considered in this analysis _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : res2 ]",
    "in the context of the benchmark point e , the process @xmath19 , @xmath20 followed by the decay @xmath21 offers a possibility to determine the scalar top mass based on the reconstructed top energy only , following a procedure similar to that adopted for the smuon mass . the same relation as eq .",
    "1 between the top energy spectrum endpoints and the masses and @xmath14 energy holds in this case , with @xmath22 and @xmath11 replacing @xmath23 and @xmath15 respectively . by determining the endpoints of the top quark energy spectrum produced in @xmath24 ,",
    "the masses of the stop and the gluino can be extracted .",
    "however , here the situation is complicated by the fact that top quarks may also be produced in @xmath25 decays or other @xmath17 decays , such as @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stop ] shows the distribution of the energy of top quarks produced in @xmath27 events .",
    "although the expected endpoints are diluted , it is still possible to extract @xmath22 from the shape of the top energy spectrum .",
    "[ fig : stop ]    a @xmath28 fit , including the contributions from other top sources in signal events , indicates that a relative accuracy @xmath297.5% can be achieved with 3  ab@xmath30 , without including beamstrahlung effects .",
    "a preliminary study of sfermion reconstruction at the clic multi - tev collider has shown that smuon masses can be measured with typical accuracies of 1.3 - 3.0  % for @xmath31  ab@xmath30 for two benchmark points , using either the muon energy technique , when @xmath32 , or a threshold scan .",
    "the accuracy of the threshold scans is significantly enhanced by the availability of polarised beams .",
    "the energy spectrum technique has also been extended to the scalar top in the case when the decay @xmath33 is kinematically allowed ."
