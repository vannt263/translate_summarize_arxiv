    "the two sets of definitions can be related to each other in perturbation theory .",

    "the lattice mass  @xmath7 and , by implication , @xmath8 are specified below .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) omits higher orders in the gauge coupling  @xmath9 and power - law artifacts .",
    "this paper determines the charm quark s mass , @xmath10 , from quenched calculations of the @xmath0 spectrum . to anticipate the main sources of uncertainty ,",
    "let us recall recent determinations the average of the up and down quarks masses  @xcite .",
    "there the three largest uncertainties  @xcite stem from , in descending order , the quenched approximation , the extrapolation to the continuum limit ( even with the clover action ) , and perturbation theory .",
    "each of these takes on a different guise for charm , however .    the error in a coupling from quenching",
    "can be partly explained by noting that couplings run differently in the quenched approximation  @xcite .",
    "one can account for this effect by running the couplings down to typical mesonic momenta with @xmath11 and then back up to a high scale with @xmath12 .",
    "but  @xmath4 does not run for  @xmath13 , so quenching should not affect @xmath14 much  @xcite",
    ".    one might expect lattice spacing errors to be worse for charmonium than for light mesons , since @xmath15 on our lattices .",
    "our spectrum calculations are of mass splittings and the so - called kinetic mass of the meson , for which the cutoff effects are powers of  @xmath16 , not @xmath17",
    "@xcite . indeed , we exploit two methods for determining @xmath10 , with opposite cutoff dependence .",
    "the two continuum limits agree , so cutoff effects are under _ better _ control .",
    "that leaves perturbation theory as the source of the largest uncertainty . to make the most of the one - loop approximation , the only order available",
    ", we use results for @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we try to reduce the effect of truncating at one loop by choosing  @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) to absorb logarithms from higher orders  @xcite .",
    "in a heavy - quark system , such as charmonium , typical three - momenta are only a few hundred  mev , suggesting that worrisome lattice artifacts are of order  @xmath20 . on the other hand , it is well - known that actions for wilson fermions approach the static limit as @xmath21 , showing that higher - dimension operators are suppressed by a factor of order  @xmath22 .",
    "the lattice hamiltonian ( defined by the transfer matrix ) clarifies the middle ground , @xmath23 .",
    "one finds  @xcite @xmath24 contributions to the artifact  @xmath25 take the form @xmath26}_n\\rangle\\sim g^{2l}b^{[l]}_n(m_0a)|\\vek{p}a|^{s_n+1},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a few hundred  mev , and @xmath28 .",
    "the function @xmath29}_n$ ] is bounded  @xcite .",
    "it is safe to replace it by a number of order unity , and thus the effect is about the same size for splittings of charmonium as for masses of light - quark hadrons .",
    "( [ eq : estimate ] ) applies only if the hopping parameter  @xmath30 is adjusted until the meson s kinetic mass @xmath31 equals the meson s physical mass .",
    "when @xmath32 , the rest mass @xmath33 is smaller . nevertheless , the _ splittings _ of meson rest masses are accurate up to eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimate ] ) .",
    "in particular , the spin - averaged binding energy @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the spin average of mesons rest masses , has relative errors of order @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "( when the quark s rest mass  @xmath37 is computed to finite order in perturbation theory , @xmath38 suffers perturbative errors as well . )    to determine @xmath10 we rely , therefore , on the following monte carlo calculations : we define the lattice spacing  @xmath39 in physical units from @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "we then obtain the quark mass either from the spin - averaged binding energy  @xmath41 of the 1s states , or from their spin - averaged kinetic mass  @xmath42 .",
    "if the monte carlo has  @xmath43 it is necessary to take  @xmath43 when deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) .",
    "although @xmath44 remains bounded  @xcite , its value can change significantly for nonzero  @xmath17 .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) is obtained by computing the quark s pole mass in lattice and in @xmath1 perturbation theory . because the lattice breaks euclidean invariance , several `` masses '' ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , etc ) describe the pole .",
    "one would like to pick a pole mass without dire lattice artifacts .",
    "we use two methods . in the first , we take the binding energy and set @xmath47 with @xmath38 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : b1 ] ) and @xmath39 from @xmath48 . in the second method ,",
    "we use the quark s kinetic mass , but reduce uncertainty in tuning  @xmath30 by taking  @xmath39 from the meson s kinetic mass : @xmath49 when @xmath38 and @xmath50 are expanded in perturbation theory , eqs .",

    "( [ eq : mm ] ) , one can combine  @xmath76 and  @xmath77 in the usual way , @xmath78 provided the constants used to define the @xmath68s are compatible .",
    "( otherwise the final @xmath64 has problems as @xmath79 . )",
    "most straightforward , we find , is to use @xmath65 and to extract @xmath80 directly from eq .",

    "our ( preliminary ) results for @xmath80 with tadpole - improved perturbation theory are plotted against  @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcharm ] .",
    "the error bar is dominated by the unknown two - loop correction to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) , estimated to be twice the square of the one - loop term . when the analysis is repeated without tadpole improvement , but still choosing @xmath19 as in sect .",
    "[ sect : q ] , the data change negligibly .",
    "the subdominant uncertainty is from the monte carlo statistics of  @xmath42 .    extrapolating the average of the two methods linearly in  @xmath82 yields @xmath83 the error bar now incorporates uncertainty in the extrapolation , e.g. , extrapolating linearly in  @xmath39 .",
    "note that the quoted result neither explicitly corrects for , nor assigns an error to , quenching , because  @xmath4 does not run when @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "a 6% uncertainty for the charm quark s mass is twice the  3% quoted for the top quark s mass from collider experiments",
    ". alas , without two - loop ( or nonperturbative ) matching for @xmath18 , top standards will be impossible to achieve .",
