    "flows with background rotation are ubiquitous in nature and engineering environments . for example , the large scale motions in atmosphere and ocean are inevitably under the influences of earth rotation , and rotary machine is very common in modern engineering .",
    "a unique characteristic of rotating fluids is that it carries inertial waves ( iws ) , such as the planar iws in infinite domains  @xcite . in confined domains ,",
    "the boundary introduces new constrains for the existence of iws and therefore modify their properties .",
    "iws may be reflected by the wall and change wavenumbers after the reflection  @xcite .",
    "the iws have been detected in many experiments , such as rotating grid turbulence  @xcite and spherical couette flow  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "for rotating grid turbulence , the iws have large scales and resonate at characteristic frequencies of the tank  @xcite , which quantitively match the theoretical predictions given by batchelor  @xcite and maas  @xcite . in the recent experiment of a rotating water - filled cylinder  @xcite ,",
    "the vortical structures associated with the iws were illustrated using flow fields obtained by particle image velocimetry .",
    "iws have also been investigated in many theoretical works , such as the asymptotic properties of inertial modes in a rotating spherical shell  @xcite and the elliptic instability of a rankin vortex with axial mean flow  @xcite .",
    "the inertial mode solutions have been constructed semi - analytically for a rectangular parallelepiped  @xcite . when a background current is added to the system",
    ", iws may show different behaviors .",
    "for the simplest case , greenspan discussed the iws in a uniform current with constant velocity  @xcite .",
    "the uniform current induces a doppler effect , and thus changes the frequency and the phase velocity .",
    "the group velocity , which indicates the direction of energy transfer , may even be against the current direction provided the wave number meets certain conditions  @xcite .    in our recent paper  @xcite , we studied the iws in a channel rotating around a streamwise axis .",
    "the inviscid iw solutions were constructed by the so - called helical wave functions .",
    "we showed that iw solutions may still exist when there exists a mean flow .",
    "and iw can be strong enough to modify the profile of the mean streamwise velocity and induce a secondary mean flow in the spanwise direction . using the concept of iw",
    ", we successfully explained the shapes of the mean velocity profiles .",
    "the numerical results support our theoretical predictions and the existence of iws in streamwise rotating channel flow .",
    "the flow visualisation reveals large - scale vortical structures for moderate rotating rate , which are associated with the iws  @xcite .",
    "here we will investigate the iws in a rotating circular pipe or annulus with an axial mean flow .",
    "the methodology used here is similar to that for channel flow  @xcite .",
    "we mainly focus on the existence of the iws and the associated mean velocity profiles .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we will provide the theoretical formulation of the iw solutions in cylindrical domain . in sec .  [ sec : results ] we will validate the theory by the numerical results of rotating pipe and circular annulus . and finally the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we now construct the inertial wave solution from the helical wave functions .",
    "suppose the pipe or annulus rotates around its axis with a constant angular velocity @xmath0 . in the rotating frame of reference , the incompressible navier - stokes equation may be written as @xmath1 in which @xmath2 is velocity , @xmath3 is vorticity , and @xmath4 is the kinematic viscosity , respectively .",

    "@xmath13 is some characteristic velocity .",
    "the rotation number measures the ratio of the coriolis force to the inertial term .",
    "the larger @xmath14 is , the faster the domain rotates .",
    "the helical wave functions have long been used to construct the inviscid iw solution in the infinite domain , c.f .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we apply them to the cylindrical domain .",
    "a brief description of the helical wave functions in cylindrical domain is given in appendix  [ app : hwf ] .",
    "let us first consider the inviscid inertial oscillation with no background flow , i.e. the wave - form solution of and with @xmath15 . assume the inertial oscillation has form @xmath16 , \\\\[0.2 cm ]      \\displaystyle \\bm{\\omega } & = & sk \\bm{\\varphi}_s\\exp[i(m\\theta + k_z z - f_s t ) ] ,    \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the frequency to be determined , @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the wave numbers in the radial and axial directions , and @xmath21 is the polarity index of the function , respectively .",
    "note that such a choice of @xmath22 ensures @xmath23 .",
    "so that the inviscid form of reduces to @xmath24 by substituting into one obtains the dispersion relation as @xmath25 the phase velocity has azimuthal and axial components , which are    [ eq : cp ] @xmath26    \\displaystyle   c_{pz } & = & -\\frac{2s\\omega}{k}. \\label{eq : cpz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath28 so that the phase keep constant in every meridian plane as the wave transfers in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the group velocity is @xmath29    the iws share several common properties with the planar ones in the infinite domain .",
    "for instance , the dispersion relation indicates that the frequency depends on the angle between the wavenumber vector and the rotating axis , but is independent with the magnitude of the wavenumber vector .",
    "equation   implies that long waves with smaller @xmath30 travel faster in the axial direction than short waves with larger @xmath30 .",
    "one difference is that iws propagate energy along the pipe axis as they travel in @xmath31-plane since the group velocity only has an axial component , while for planar iws the group velocity is always perpendicular to the wavenumber vector  @xcite .",
    "now consider the flow driven by an external constant mean pressure gradient @xmath32 along the axis .",
    "hereafter an overline stands for averaging in @xmath33- and @xmath34-directions and over time . based on the existing experiments and numerical simulations , it is reasonable to assume that the mean flow has the velocity and vorticity profiles @xmath35   \\displaystyle \\overline{\\bm{\\omega}}(r ) & = &            \\left(\\ , 0,\\ \\overline{\\omega}_\\theta(r),\\ \\overline{\\omega}_z(r ) \\,\\right ) \\\\[0.1 cm ]    & = & \\left(\\,0,\\ -\\partial_r \\overline{u}_z,\\ \\partial_r(r\\overline{u}_\\theta ) / r \\,\\right ) , \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] which depend solely on @xmath28 and have zero radial components .",
    "@xmath36 represents the derivative with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "we denote the fluctuating velocity and vorticity by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . following the methodology of refs .   and , we seek the travelling wave solution of the inviscid fluctuating vorticity equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "we have made the assumption that @xmath41 is large so that the viscous effect may be neglected at the bulk region away from the wall boundary .    at moderate rotation rate with @xmath42 ,",
    "in the terms containing mean quantities have comparable order of magnitude with the coriolis term , thus they are not negligible . however , one can still seek the iw solutions of the equation .",
    "assume that the formal wave solution exists , then for such velocity and vorticity fields one has @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath45 with @xmath46 being an added system rotation introduced by the mean flow .",
    "note that @xmath47 only has azimuthal and axial components and is a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the component form of reads    [ eq : vort - iw - mf ] @xmath48    if the two terms with underline vanish , i.e. the mean flow satisfying the iw condition @xmath49 eq",
    ".   reduces to the same form as with @xmath50 being replaced by an effective rotation rate @xmath51",
    ". meanwhile , implies immediately that @xmath47 is independent of @xmath28 , then @xmath52 is also constant . for the iw with axial mean flow , the dispersion relation and the expression for phase and group velocity have the same forms as - , only with @xmath53 being replaced by @xmath54 .",
    ".   also determines the profiles of the mean velocity .",
    "recall that both @xmath55 and @xmath56 only depend on @xmath28 , thus by the explicit form of reads    [ eq : iwc2 ] @xmath57    \\displaystyle \\partial_r \\overline{\\omega}_z & = & sk \\partial_r \\overline{u}_z .",
    "\\label{eq : iwc2b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we use @xmath58 to denote the wavenumber which satisfies the condition . for the flow in pipe or between two concentric cylinders ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath59 has a maximum , which we denote as @xmath60 at radial location @xmath61 . then by one has @xmath62 .",
    "suppose the azimuthal velocity at @xmath61 is @xmath63 , then one may further choose a rotating frame of reference so that @xmath64 , which is easily achieved by setting @xmath65",
    ". in this new frame of reference , is equivalent to @xmath66 . and",
    "by combining and one has @xmath67 which gives @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the first order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "@xmath71 is the amplitude of the iws .",
    "we notice that has the same form as the kelvin mode of zero wavenumber in the axial direction , e.g. see  @xcite .",
    "the profile of the streamwise mean velocity is then readily derived from as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind . finally , by transferring back to the original rotating frame of reference with angular speed @xmath53 , the mean velocity profiles read    [ eq : iwo ] @xmath74    which will be tested against numerical results in the following section .",
    "to test the above theoretical predictions for rotating pipe flow , we employ the data from the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) done by orlandi s group  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath75 , @xmath4 , @xmath76 , and @xmath53 be the pipe radius , the kinematic viscosity , the streamwise mean velocity at centerline , and the background rotation , respectively .",

    "please see refs .  .",

    "[ fig : rtc ] we plot the mean velocity profiles obtained by the numerical simulations .",
    "for all three cases , the mean axial velocity @xmath59 reaches a maximum at similar location , @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 is not equal to zero but a negative value .",
    "all those quantities are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : cyd ] . in the bulk region @xmath83 has an inner maximum at @xmath84 and an outer minimum at @xmath85 respectively .",
    "near each boundary there is another peak which is in the opposite direction than the adjacent bulk peak .",
    "the overall shape of @xmath83 is very similar to that in the streamwise rotating channel flow  @xcite .     of each case .",
    "the curves on the left of @xmath61 are computed by @xmath86 and on the right of @xmath61 by @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "( a ) profiles of mean axial velocity , and ( b ) profiles of mean azimuthal velocity . in ( b ) for clarity each curve is shifted upward by @xmath88 from the previous one.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    to apply the theory to the current flow , we follow the same procedure as for pipe flow .",
    "however , extra care needs to be taken because now @xmath89 is not zero .",
    "furthermore , the distance between the inner maximum of @xmath83 and @xmath61 is not the same as that between the outer minimum and @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that the iw wavenumbers are different for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus by the inner maximum and the outer minimum we fix two sets of wavenumber and amplitude , i.e. @xmath86 and @xmath90 , which are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : cyd ] . with these parameters",
    "we compute the theoretical predictions of the mean velocity profiles in the bulk region and compare to the numerical results , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtc ] . the agreement between the theory and the simulations",
    "are extremely well around @xmath61 .",
    "again , this strongly implies that iws exist in such flow .",

    "the yellow ( or the light grey ) color marks the vortices at the region @xmath85 and the blue ( or the dark grey ) color at the region @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the mean axial flow is from the upper - left corner to the lower - right corner . clearly , the vortices at @xmath85 form very large clusters which tilt away from the axis by a small angle .",
    "the vortices at @xmath84 also form some weak clusters , which tilt towards the opposite direction to those clusters at @xmath85 . since we employ the periodic conditions in both azimuthal and axial directions , those clusters are actually helix - like and rotate around the inner boundary of the annulus .",
    "these structures share the same nature as those in the streamwise rotating channel flow  @xcite , where two sets of large scale clusters locate at each side of the centreline where the mean axial velocity reaches maximum , since the streamwise rotating channel can be treated as an annulus with infinity large radius .",

    "the main axial flow is from upper - left corner to lower - right corner.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "in summary , we have found the inviscid iw solutions for circular pipe or annulus which constantly rotates around its axis with a moderate angular speed .",
    "our analysis shows that even when there is an axial mean flow , the iw solutions can still exist in the bulk region provided that the mean velocity profiles satisfy certain iw conditions .",
    "namely , the mean azimuthal velocity profile obeys the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind and the mean axial velocity profile takes the shape of the first - order bessel function of the first kind , respectively .",
    "the mean velocity acts as a modulation of the background rotation .",
    "the theory is then validated against the numerical results of rotating pipe and annulus flow . indeed in the bulk region the mean velocity profiles exhibit the exact shapes which the theory predicts for both flows .",
    "compared to the non rotating case , the existence of iws induces a mean azimuthal flow and modifies the mean axial flow , so that the mean velocity profiles evolve into certain shapes and satisfy the iw condition .",
    "flow visualisation reveals that these iws are associated with large scale vortex clusters , which is very similar to that in streamwise rotating channel flow  @xcite .",
    "all these findings for different domains suggest that such iws are quite common in that rotating wall bounded flow with rotation axis being parallel to the main flow direction .",
