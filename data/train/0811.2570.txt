    "photonic bandgap materials are ordered arrays of scatterers that do not allow electromagnetic wave propagation in some frequency ranges named gaps @xcite .",
    "the important challenge in the field of photonic crystals is tunability , in other words , possibility to control the depth , width and position of these frequency gaps .",
    "this can be achieved by various means such as liquid crystal infiltration @xcite , temperature @xcite , elastic strain @xcite , and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we explore here a novel route to achieve tunable photonic bandgap materials : magnetic - field - induced _ order - disorder _ transition .    since the gaps in photonic bandgap materials arise from their periodically - ordered structure , we would _ apriori _ expect that disorder destroys the gaps .",
    "however , it is well - known that disorder by itself may result in wave localization , i.e. it may create the gap @xcite . hence the effect of disorder on photonic bandgap materials may be multidirectional and it comes at no surprise that it has been studied so intensively during last years .",
    "numerous analytical and numerical studies showed that the gaps in photonic crystals are robust @xcite , i.e. they do not disappear under weak and moderate disorder .",
    "more specifically , it was found that under _ weak disorder _ the gap edges become smeared @xcite , the higher - order gaps become more shallow @xcite , while the depth of the first stopband remains almost unaffected @xcite . under _ moderate disorder _ the first stopband becomes more shallow @xcite . under",
    "_ strong disorder _",
    "there appear localized states in the gaps , which are characterized by enhanced transmission @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions indicate that the effect of disorder is most pronounced at the gap edges and is minimal in the passbands , at the frequencies corresponding to the so - called bragg remnant or antigap @xcite .",
    "various kinds of disorder ( positional disorder , size disorder , fluctuations in refraction index , etc . ) produce almost the same qualitative effect .",
    "the only exception is sliding disorder ( or stacking faults ) which can increase the depth of the gap @xcite .",
    "there are only a few experimental studies of the wave propagation in photonic bandgap materials with disorder .",
    "@xcite studied microwave propagation through the two - dimensional arrays of rods and found bandgap smearing upon increasing positional disorder , while ref.@xcite studied microwave transmission through random assemblies of spheres and observed wave localization and stopband resulting from disorder .",
    "introduction of small controlled disorder ( in fact , `` quasicrystalline '' order ) into two - dimensional photonic bandgap material allows to achieve a full photonic stopband in the near - infrared @xcite .    in this work we explore possibility of tuning of photonic bandgap materials by _ continuous _ variation of the degree of disorder .",
    "this is done in the mm - wave range with a model system of metallic magnetizable spheres whose lateral position is controlled by external magnetic field .",
    "this resembles the polymer - dispersed liquid crystals where fluctuations in the optical birefringerence are controlled by electric field @xcite .",
    "a similar idea ( although based on particle reorientation rather than motion in magnetic field ) has been suggested with respect to photonic bandgap materials @xcite .",
    "we build our photonic crystal from the 2 mm diameter steel spheres . in the presence of magnetic field each sphere acquires magnetic moment proportional to the field ,",
    "@xmath0 where @xmath1 is external magnetic field , @xmath2 is the volume of the sphere , and @xmath3 is the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we used squid magnetometer to measure particle magnetization in the fields up to 500 oe and found coercive force of 5 oe and volume susceptibility @xmath3=0.15 .",
    "we put 397 spheres into a 0.67 mm thick plexiglas container ( figs.[fig:1],[fig:2 ] ) and mounted several such containers in the stack .",
    "the interlayer spacing is 3.5 - 4.5 mm , while the nearest - neighbor distance in a single layer is 3 mm .",
    "the stack is mounted inside the helmholtz coils . in the presence of external magnetic field",
    "the spheres become magnetized in the direction perpendicular to the layers , in such a way that the spheres in each layer repel each other .",
    "the out - of - plane attraction between the spheres is small compared to the in - plane repulsion .",
    "the static particle configuration in each layer is determined by the interplay between ( i ) magnetic forces and ( ii ) static friction forces between the spheres and the substrate . under",
    "_ strong _ magnetic field , magnetic forces exceed friction forces and the particles self - assemble into hexagonally - ordered crystalline lattice whose orientation is determined by the container shape .",
    "since we use the hexagonally - shaped container , and the total number of particles corresponds to the perfect hexagonal packing , the resulting lattice is almost perfect at strong magnetic field - fig.[fig:1 ] . at the _ intermediate _ magnetic field ,",
    "the friction forces deform this crystalline lattice , in such a way that it splits on several crystalline grains separated by grain boundaries . in the _ weak _ magnetic field ,",
    "the friction forces dominate , the particles are in the disordered ( amorphous or glassy ) state and may touch one another .    to characterize disorder we took images of the particle configuration using a ccd camera and then performed digital fourier - transform of the images . in the strong field",
    "we observe sharp bragg peaks ( fig.[fig:1 ] , right panel ) indicating on crystalline order ; at the intermediate field the intensity of these peaks decreases and the diffuse background appears ( fig .",
    "1b ) ; in the weak magnetic field the bragg peaks disappear , indicating on the absence of the crystalline order ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the images of our arrays ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) are very similar to the snapshot of the particle configuration in the system of interacting magnetic dipoles at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "however , instead of temperature , the disordering agent in our case is static friction between the particles and the substrate .",
    "we measured mm - wave transmission through our device at normal incidence and in the range of 20 - 50 ghz .",
    "we used a hp850c vector network analyzer as a source and two standard gain horn antennae to which we attached home - made collimating teflon lenses ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the inner curvature of the lens is 15 cm , the outer curvature is 30 cm , the distance between antennae is 28 cm , the beam diameter is 6 cm .",
    "the height of the device is 4 - 5 cm . to prevent diffraction at the edges of the stack , we put two apertures above and below the stack .",
    "the aperture size is slightly smaller than the container diameter .",
    "the receiving antenna accepts radiation in the angle of @xmath4 , hence it measures forward transmission and small angle scattering as well .",
    "the noise floor of our setup is -50 db ( measured by replacing a sample with a conducting foil of the same diameter ) .",
    "calibration was performed without sample .",
    "the size of the particles , the distance between them and the distance between the layers was carefully chosen in such a way as to achieve a wide and deep stopband in the accessible frequency range .",
    "this was done by computer simulations using ansoft software .",
    "we studied transmission through the stack of 6 - 10 layers as a function of magnetic field , i.e. at different degrees of in - plane disorder .",
    "the measurements were performed as follows .",
    "we applied a certain magnetic field to initially disordered array and either gently vibrated it or sent a short current pulse ( `` magnetic stirring '' ) to achieve equilibration .",
    "then we measured mm - wave transmission through the stack . at the next step we switched off the magnetic field and vibrated the stack once again to recover initial , disordered state .",
    "then we repeated the measurement for another value of magnetic field and so on .",
    "while there exist many particular configurations corresponding to a certain value of the external magnetic field , the mm - wave transmission through these metastable configurations differ only in minor details .",
    "therefore , we performed 3 - 10 vector transmission measurements at the same value of magnetic field and for different particle configurations ; and vectorially averaged the results",
    ". we also checked experimentally that the transmission through the stack is almost independent of the polarization of the incident wave .",
    "a small lateral shift of one of the layers with respect to another ( sliding disorder ) was also found to be unimportant .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows mm - wave transmission through the six - layer stack at two extreme values of magnetic field : one corresponding to completely ordered state , and another corresponding to completely disordered state . in the ordered state",
    "there is a well - defined stopband at 24 - 44 ghz . for the stack with only six layers ,",
    "the transmission in the stopband is very small , @xmath5 35 db .",
    "reflectivity in the stopband is close to unity ( not shown here ) @xcite .",
    "transmission in the passband can be as high as -1 - 2 db , indicating on negligible absorption losses .",
    "this is not surprising since the losses are determined by the ratio of the skin - depth @xmath6 in the material of the sphere to its radius @xmath7 . for the mm - wave frequencies this ratio is so small @xmath8 , that the spheres can be considered ideally conducting , i.e. lossless .",
    "the spikes in the stopband in the fig.[fig:3 ] do not arise from the noise of the measurement system .",
    "they are related to the finite number of layers and to the resonant transmission .",
    "the spikes in the magnitude of transmission are accompanied with the similar features in the phase ( not shown here ) .    upon decreasing magnetic field ,",
    "the stopband becomes smeared and eventually disappears .",
    "transmission monotonously decreases with decreasing field at all frequencies .",
    "the strongest effect of magnetic field is at the stopband edges where it achieves 30 db ; while inside the stopband the magnetic field effect is negligible .",
    "magnetic field effect in the passband is also quite pronounced . to study it in more details we prepared a similar stack but with increased interlayer separation . here",
    ", the stopband is shifted to lower frequencies in such a way that the frequency range above the first stopband becomes `` visible '' .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the effect of magnetic field on the mm - wave transmission in this crystal",
    ". the magnetic field effect in the stopband may achieve 15 db .",
    "note the broad transmission peak between the first and the second stopband in the disordered state , in the frequency range corresponding to the passband in the ordered state .",
    "this peak of enhanced transmission is known as bragg remnant or antigap @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows magnetic field dependence of the mm - wave transmission for the sample of fig.4 and at few different frequencies , corresponding to the midgap , gap edge , and antigap .",
    "although the overall variation of transmission strongly depends on frequency , the field dependence is much more the same : strong linear increase below 60 oe followed by saturation at higher field .",
    "the only exception is the midgap frequency where the overall change in transmission is so small that its functional dependence can not be reliably determined .",
    "this can produce a false impression that the mm - wave transmission is totally insensitive to magnetic field for the frequencies corresponding to the midgap . however , this is not exactly so .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows mm - wave transmission through the stack in which we introduced a planar defect , i.e. we displaced two halves of the stack ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) in such a way that the distance between two central layers is increased as compared to other interlayer distances .",
    "this results in a sharp transmission peak inside the stopband at 34.7 ghz . upon",
    "decreasing magnetic field this peak decreases and completely disappears at @xmath9 . the effect of magnetic field on transmission at the resonance frequency amounts to 30 db .",
    "therefore , magnetic field can strongly affect transmission in the stopband provided this transmission is resonant .",
    "magnetic field affects not only the magnitude of the transmission ( figs .",
    "[ fig:3],[fig:4],[fig:5],[fig:6 ] ) but the phase as well .",
    "this means that the phase and group velocity can be magnetically tuned .",
    "these velocities are determined from the dispersion relation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the wavevector and @xmath12 is the frequency . to determine @xmath10 we performed vector transmission measurements at fixed field and for the stack with varying number of layers , @xmath13 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the wavevector were found from the experimental data using the following relations : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the power transmission coefficient , @xmath16 is the phase shift upon transmission , @xmath17 is the unit cell period in the direction of propagation .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows our results . in the ordered state",
    ", the @xmath18 is very small beyond the stopband , as expected in the lossless material .",
    "this is in contrast to the disordered state where the @xmath18 is more or less the same at all frequencies .",
    "note the gap in @xmath19 in the ordered state and the absence of the gap in the disordered state .",
    "the group velocity is @xmath20 . in the disordered state",
    "it is fairly frequency - independent , while in the ordered state it demonstrates strong frequency dependence , in particular , @xmath21 at the stopband edges .",
    "therefore , group velocity can be continuously tuned by magnetic field .",
    "although particle configuration in each layer strongly depends on magnetic field , to understand how the changes in configuration affect the mm - wave transmission through the whole sample is not an easy task . indeed , to explain the appearance of the stopband for the certain direction of propagation in a three - dimensional photonic bandgap material , it is usually enough to represent it as a multilayer with periodicity _ only _ in the direction of propagation .",
    "in this representation the layers are assumed spatially uniform and the details of the particle arrangement in each layer are of little importance .",
    "our idea is that any deviation from the in - plane crystalline order leads to fluctuations in the area density of particles .",
    "therefore , the layer can be no more considered as uniform .",
    "the purpose of our modeling is to find how the _ in - layer _ disorder affects the electromagnetic wave propagation _",
    "perpendicular _ to the layers .",
    "we attribute the effect of lateral disorder to the area density fluctuations .",
    "the modeling is performed in three steps .",
    "first we estimate fluctuations of the particle area density as a function of magnetic field .",
    "secondly , we calculate refraction index and reflectivity of a single layer of spheres with fluctuating area density .",
    "thirdly , we consider wave propagation through the stack of such layers .",
    "particle configuration in our array is determined by the interplay between magnetic and friction forces .",
    "consider first magnetic forces .",
    "the potential energy of induced magnetic dipole - dipole repulsion is : @xmath22where @xmath23 is the particle position , @xmath24 is the particle magnetic moment .",
    "magnetic forces @xmath25 drive particles into equilibrium hexagonally - ordered state where magnetic repulsion energy is minimized and @xmath26 .",
    "the lattice constant of this array is determined by the number of particles and the size and shape of container @xcite . since",
    "magnetic susceptibility of our spheres is not high , we assume @xmath27 where @xmath1 is _ external _ field ( rather than the sum of the external field and the induced field of other particles ) .    to achieve equilibrium , the particles should move laterally . here , static friction forces become important . indeed , to push a hard sphere on flat substrate out of equilibrium requires application of some mimimal force , exceeding static friction force , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is normal force on a particle and @xmath30 is the rolling friction coefficient which depends on the radius of the sphere and on the nature of contacting surfaces . in the presence of static friction the particles start to move only when @xmath31 and come to rest when @xmath32 . to characterize the interplay between magnetic and friction forces we introduce `` magnetic length '' @xmath33 that represents a minimal distance between two isolated magnetized spheres on substrate with friction .",
    "we find it from the relation @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) yields @xmath35 in this work we are interested in the magnetizable particles ( @xmath27 ) , hence @xmath36 . the magnetic length should be compared to the average distance between the particles .",
    "the latter is conveniently characterized by the wigner - seitz radius @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the area density of the particles .",
    "note that @xmath39 is controlled by magnetic field ( eq.[l - h ] ) while @xmath40 is field - independent . in what follows",
    "we consider different regimes , defined by the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .      here",
    "magnetic repulsion tends to keep the particles at equal distances . for confined array and at high enough field this results in the hexagonally - ordered `` crystalline '' state .",
    "the whole array is a single crystallite ( with probably few point defects ) which is deformed by friction forces . in the absence of point defects such as dislocations and disclinations @xcite",
    ", we estimate the area density fluctuations arising from elastic deformations as follows .",
    "the condition of static equilibrium of the elastically deformed planar crystalline lattice is @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the stress tensor and @xmath44 is the density of bulk external forces which in our case are friction forces .",
    "the magnitude of these forces is @xmath45 .",
    "we assume that their correlation radius is the wigner - seitz radius , @xmath40 . by integrating eq.[equil ] over unit cell ,",

    "the corresponding density fluctuations are very small : @xmath54      here @xmath55 . in this regime ,",
    "the friction forces between the particles and the substrate are strong enough to split the crystalline lattice onto separate grains with well - defined grain boundaries .",
    "to estimate the grain size @xmath56 , we follow larkin - ovchinnikov treatment of the pinned vortex lattice in superconducting films @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy , associated with one particle in the lattice pinned by friction force , is @xmath57 .",
    "since the friction forces are randomly oriented , the average pinning energy for the grain of area @xmath58 , containing @xmath59 particles , is @xmath60 .",
    "these pinning forces lead to displacement of the grain boundary by @xmath61 .",
    "the elastic energy associated with this displacement is @xmath62 .",
    "the excess energy per unit area of such lattice is : @xmath63 since @xmath64 we neglect here the elastic energy due to compressional deformations .",
    "minimization of eq.[lo ] yields the equilibrium grain size , @xmath65 . using eqs.[l - h],[mu ]",
    "we find the grain size @xmath66    to estimate density fluctuations we note that the lattice in the grains is almost perfect , while the particle configuration at grain boundaries is distorted and strong deformations @xmath67 occur there ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath68 in the grains and @xmath69 at grain boundaries . the relative concentration of grain boundary particles is @xmath70 .",
    "the average fluctuation of the deformations in the area @xmath71 , containing @xmath72 particles , is @xmath73      here @xmath74 . the particle arrangement reminds a glass or amorphous solid consisting of impenetrable spheres with the radius @xmath39 .",
    "the area density fluctuation in the area @xmath71 containing @xmath75 particles is @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the pair correlation function . following ref.@xcite , we assume that the correlation function for the dense disordered planar array of impenetrable spheres of radius @xmath7 is such that @xmath78 .",
    "we substitute @xmath7 by @xmath39 , @xmath38 by @xmath79 , introduce these values into eq.[fluct2 ] and find @xmath80 since @xmath36 , the eq.[fluct - low ] yields density fluctuations _",

    "note , that if @xmath81 , where @xmath7 is the radius of the sphere , the magnetic forces are too small as compared to friction forces , and magnetic field is inoperative .",

    "the average nearest - neighbor distance is smaller than @xmath84 . when the planar electromagnetic wave is incident on such a layer , it is not absorbed but scattered .",
    "the scattering occurs mostly in the backward and forward directions , while the scattering in oblique directions is strongly suppressed .",

    "the taylor expansion of eqs.[n1],[y1 ] with respect to @xmath38 yields @xmath105 @xmath106 to find @xmath102 in the disordered state we use the same eqs .",
    "[ n2],[y2 ] and substitute @xmath107 by area density fluctuations .",

    "the above approach reduces the effect of disorder on @xmath102 to the area density fluctuations .",
    "when the array of particles is ordered , this corresponds to compressional deformations .",
    "however , disorder introduces shear deformations as well .",
    "these deformations change local crystalline symmetry and this affects refraction index and admittance through the local field factor @xmath98 @xcite . in principle",
    ", the effect of shear deformations may be treated along the same lines by considering taylor expansion of eqs.[n1],[y1 ] with respect to @xmath98 .",
    "we represent our sample as a multilayer consisting of alternating layers of conducting spheres and air spacings between them .",
    "wave transmission through multilayers is most easily accounted for by the matrix method @xcite . here",
    ", each layer is characterized by two matrices : ( i ) the phase matrix representing the phase shift upon transmission through this layer , and ( ii ) the reflectivity matrix which is determined by the ratio of admittances at the reflecting interface and is independent of the layer thickness .",
    "transmission through the multilayer is the product of all these matrices .",
    "we relate the effect of disorder on transmission through our multilayer to the area density fluctuations in the layers of conducting spheres .",
    "we assume that the lateral size of important fluctuations corresponds to the area that radiates coherently , _ as seen from the next interface _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the unit cell period in the direction of propagation and @xmath83 is the wavelength . in what follows",
    "we consider the effect of area density fluctuations in different frequency ranges .",
    "the antigap is the narrow frequency range in the passband where the layer of spheres may be represented as a half - wavelength plate , i.e. , the phase shift on propagation through this layer is a muliple of @xmath114 .",
    "transmission through such layer is close to unity due to destructive interference of the waves reflected from both interfaces and is almost independent on the layer admittance .",
    "transmission at the antigap frequency is , therefore , determined mostly by refraction index fluctuations across the layers ( eq.[n2 ] ) .",
    "the latter result in the phase shift fluctuations , @xmath115 .",
    "the power transmission through the multilayer decreases by the debye - waller factor , @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "what is important here is the relative deviation of the phase shift when going from one layer to another .",
    "hence , the averaging in the exponent is for different layers , i.e. for different realizations of the disordered state . since @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the free space wavevector , then @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the ratio of transmittances for the @xmath13-layer stack is @xmath120 note that the ratio of transmittances is @xmath121 , i.e. increases with frequency .",
    "therefore the effect of disorder is more pronounced in the higher - order passbands .      in the midgap",
    "the reflected waves from all interfaces sum up in phase , hence the reflectivity is maximal and transmission is minimal . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the first stopband and to the quarter - wavelength stack . transmission through such stack is @xmath122 @xcite where @xmath13 is the number of layers .",
    "the average admittance of each layer in the disordered state is @xmath123 where the averaging is performed over the whole layer .",
    "this results in @xmath124      to account for the effect of disorder on the transmission at gap edges we draw analogy to the optical properties of disordered semiconductors . upon increasing disorder ,",
    "the gap in semiconductors becomes smeared and there appear exponential transmission tails at gap edges ( urbach tails ) .",
    "the frequency dependence of optical transmission through semiconductors and at the gap edge is @xcite : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the lattice constant variation which can arise from structural or temperature fluctuations . we rewrite eq.[urbach ] for a single frequency , and note that @xmath127",
    "then eq.[urbach ] yields the ratio of the transmissions in the ordered and disordered states at any frequency corresponding to the gap edge as @xmath128      in addition to the frequency - selective effects considered in previous subsections , there is also scattering that decreases transmission at all frequencies @xcite .",
    "these extinction losses are also proportional to density fluctuations @xcite : @xmath129    we observe that eqs.[antigap],[midgap],[urbach],[scattering ] - all yield exponential dependence of the transmission on density fluctuations , @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the transmission in the completely ordered state and @xmath132 is the frequency - dependent prefactor .",
    "equation [ master ] assumes monotonous dependence of transmission on disorder .",
    "this is valid only for the relatively weak disorder , while for the strong disorder this dependence can be nonmonotonous in certain frequency ranges @xcite .",
    "we explore magnetic field dependence of the in - plane disorder . we quantify disorder through the intensity of diffuse rings in the fourier transform images ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "as it is well - known from the @xmath133-ray structure analysis , @xmath134 is directly related to the lattice constant fluctuations , which are closely related to the density fluctuations , i.e. @xmath135 . at figs.[fig:8],[fig:9 ] we plot @xmath134 in dependence of magnetic field . here , we set @xmath136 in the completely disordered state , i.e. at @xmath9 . in the weak field",
    "the data can be well approximated by the linear dependence , @xmath137 as predicted by eq.[fluct - low ] for the amorphous state . at higher field ,",
    "the data are fairly well approximated by the @xmath138 dependence ( see also fig.[fig:9 ] ) , as predicted by eq.[fluctlo ] for the polycrystalline state @xcite .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes occurs at @xmath139 50 - 60 oe .",
    "this corresponds to the field when the bragg peaks in the fourier transform image are replaced by diffuse rings ( fig.1 ) and is suggestive of some kind of melting or glass transition @xcite .      to verify relation between transmission and area density fluctuations , as predicted by eq.[master ] , we plot them together versus magnetic field ( figs.[fig:8],[fig:9 ] ) .",
    "both @xmath140 and @xmath141 dependences collapse on one curve .",
    "this means that @xmath141 is indeed proportional to @xmath134 and to the density fluctuations , as predicted by eq.[master ] .",

    "we conclude that our model qualitatively predicts field dependence of the transmission through disordered photonic crystal . to achieve better quantitative agreement",
    ", there is need in a more advanced model of the kind suggested by ref.@xcite .",
    "this model should go further than eqs.[n],[y],[n1],[y1 ] which assume low concentration of scatterers and rayleigh scattering regime .",
    "the model should also account for the quadrupole interactions between magnetized particles .",
    "the microwave transmission through the crystal with a planar defect can be treated following the same lines .",
    "we consider the photonic crystal split on two halves , as two photonic crystals coupled through the fabry - perot resonator .",
    "transmission through this device is @xcite : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the spacing between the mirrors and @xmath164 and @xmath165 are complex transmission and the reflection coefficients for each of the halves ( note that @xmath165 and @xmath164 are interrelated and both are affected by disorder ) .",
    "the resonant transmission through such a crystal is possible provided the denominator of eq.[fabry ] is small , i.e. @xmath166 .",
    "even small disorder strongly affects this condition , hence the transmission through the defect drops dramatically in the disordered state ( fig.[fig:61 ] ) .",
    "continuous variation of electromagnetic properties of our samples when external magnetic field goes to zero closely resembles the change of optical properties of liquids upon approaching the critical point .",
    "indeed , the optical transmission at the critical point is very small due to enhanced density fluctuations . according to einstein s theory",
    ", the density fluctuations inversely depend on compressibility which goes to zero at the critical point @xcite .",
    "the compressibility of our array of magnetizable spheres , @xmath167 ( eq.[mu ] ) , also diverges when @xmath168 .",
    "the density fluctuations , as it is shown by eq.[fluctlo ] , increase accordingly .",
    "our experiments bear some resemblance to the studies of electromagnetic wave propagation through ferrofluids @xcite . indeed , in the absence of magnetic field the particles in ferrofluid are in the disordered state , while in the presence of magnetic field they self - assemble into chains .",
    "this results in field - induced anisotropy which strongly affects the polarization of the electromagnetic wave propagating through such a media .",
    "however , magnetic field does not induce the long - range order in ferrofluids , hence the field - induced anisotropy is _ frequency - independent_. this is very different from our present experiment where magnetic field drives the particle array into crystalline state with a long - range order , and this has a strong _ frequency - selective _ effect on the microwave transmission .",
    "however , two - dimensional ferrofluid layers @xcite bear strong resemblance to our system .",
    "in summary , we demonstrate a metallo - dielectric photonic crystal exhibiting stopband in the mm - wave range .",
    "mm - wave transmission through this crystal can be controlled by external magnetic field through magnetic field - induced order - disorder transition .",
    "we develop a physical model which describes our experimental data fairly well .",
    "our concepts may be useful in interpretation of the effect of disorder in photonic bandgap materials .",
    "our results can be useful for the fabrication of tunable planar photonic crystals , based on surface waves , in particular surface plasmons . if the surface is covered with the liquid layer containing movable magnetic particles , ( especially when this layer represents a photonic crystal with a tunable lattice constant ) the propagation of the surface waves can be effectively monitored .",
