    "<S> we investigate the relation between stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) , and metallicity ( @xmath1 ) of galaxies , so called the fundamental metallicity relation , in the galaxy sample of the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 . </S>",
    "<S> we separate the galaxies into narrow redshift bins and compare the relation at different redshifts , and find statistically significant ( @xmath2% ) evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we test various observational effects that might cause seeming @xmath1 evolution , and find it difficult to explain the evolution of the relation only by the observational effects . in the current sample of low redshift galaxies , galaxies with different @xmath0 and sfr </S>",
    "<S> are sampled from different redshifts , and there is degeneracy between @xmath0/sfr and redshift . hence it is not straightforward to distinguish a relation between @xmath1 and sfr from a relation between @xmath1 and redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of the intrinsic relation from the redshift evolution effect is a crucial issue to understand evolution of galaxies . </S>"
