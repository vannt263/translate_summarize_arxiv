    "the purpose of this work is to characterize the crystal bases of the demazure modules of @xmath0 in terms of paths , or extended young diagrams , and obtain explicit expressions for their full characters .",
    "there are two ways to motivate this work : one can motivate it from the viewpoint of certain recent developments in mathematical physics , or from the viewpoint of representation theory .      certain physical quantities in exactly solvable two - dimensional lattice models ,",
    "namely the so - called 1-point functions can be evaluated using baxter s corner transfer matrix method .",
    "this method reduces the computation of 1-point functions to a computation of a weighted sum .",
    "this sum is over combinatorial objects called paths : 1-dimensional configurations , defined on the half - line .",
    "they will be discussed in detail in the sequel .",
    "the weight of a path is the evaluation , on that path , of an energy functional defined on the set of all paths .",
    "the weighted sum is the generating function of the number of paths of a certain weight .",
    "one way to evaluate this generating function is by solving a recursion relation for the generating function that counts the number of paths defined on a finite segment , of length @xmath4 , of the half - line .",
    "the recursion is with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 limit of the result , which is the generating function of all paths , turns out to be the character of a highest weight module of an infinite - dimensional algebra : an affine , or virasoro algebra .",
    "the result obtained by solving a recursion relation typically has a form that , for physical reasons , is called bosonic.      more recently , the same physical objects were evaluated in a completely different way , using bethe ansatz methods @xcite . in that case , the results turn out to have a completely different form , that , for the same physical reasons as above , is refered to as fermionic.    equating the bosonic and fermionic expressions for the same objects , one obtains rogers - ramanujan - type identities between @xmath6-series . strictly speaking , such identities are conjectures , since the methods used to obtain them are indirect , and involve certain physical assumptions. what one needs are direct proofs .",
    "one method to obtain direct proofs , which dates back to schur , is to work at the level of the generating functions of all paths that live on a segement of the half - line of length @xmath4 .",
    "these are polynomials that depend on @xmath4 .",
    "once we can prove the boson - fermion identities for finite @xmath4 , we take the limit @xmath5 , and obtain the original @xmath6-series identities .    the following question now arises : if the original infinite @xmath6-series are characters of highest weight modules of infinite - dimensional algebras , are the finite-@xmath4 polynomials the characters of anything ?",
    "do they have a meaning in mathematics ? or are they just convenient objects that appear in intermediate steps ?",
    "the reason why this question arises is that rigorous proofs in exactly solvable models are typically obstructed by the fact that we have to deal with infinite series , and infinite - dimensional quantities .",
    "the reason why we typically have to do that , is that only in the limit @xmath5 do these model exhibit invariance under infinite - dimensional algebras , and this invariance is an essential ingredient in solvability .",
    "thus we have the following problem : we need to work in the @xmath7 limit in order to be able to obtain exact solutions , but in that limit we can not provide rigorous proofs .",
    "this is the reason why it is very interesting to try to understand as much of the structure of exactly solvable models as possible at the level of finite @xmath4 .",
    "the hope is that we can find algebraic structures at finite @xmath4 that are sufficiently strong to provide rigorous proofs and solutions . a typical object to investigate are the @xmath4-restricted generating functions .",
    "what we find in this work , is that these objects do have a mathematical significance , or are directly related to objects that do .",
    "we find that the @xmath4-restricted generating functions are closely related to the characters of demazure modules .      from the viewpoint of representation theory , we can motivate our work in the evaluation of the characters of demazure modules .",
    "the demazure module is characterized by its highest weight @xmath2 and weyl group element @xmath3 , and is denoted by @xmath1 . in @xcite , a formula for computing the demazure character @xmath8 is given as follows . for @xmath9 , define the operator @xmath10\\longrightarrow\\z[p]$ ] by @xmath11 let @xmath12 be a reduced expression . for the terminologies of @xmath0",
    "see subsection 1.1 .",
    "then , the demazure character formula states that @xmath13 as elegant as this character formula is , it is anything but combinatorial . hence using this formula it is very difficult to get any information about specific weight spaces . in @xcite ,",
    "sanderson used littelrmann s path model @xcite and gave nice expressions for the ` real ' characters of @xmath1 for all @xmath2 and the ` principal ' characters of @xmath1 for @xmath14 .",
    "we point out that the real ( resp .",
    "principal ) character of @xmath1 is the specialization of @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) .      in 1990",
    "kashiwara brought a notion of crystal base in the representation theory of the quantum group @xcite .",
    "this notion is quite powerful in the combinatorial aspect of representation theory . as an example",
    ", we find @xcite in which the littlewood - richardson type rules for the classical lie algebras are given in a purely combinatorial way .",
    "kashiwara also obtained the crystal bases of the demazure modules as subsets of those of the corresponding highest weight modules @xcite .",
    "his algorithm is given in a recursive way .",
    "consequently he got a new proof of the demazure character formula .",
    "since we know that in the case of affine lie algebra the crystal base of the highest weight module is described in terms of paths @xcite , it is natural to try to characterize the crystal base of the demazure module in this language . for the affine algebra of type",
    "a we have yet another notion to describe the crystal base , that is , extended young diagram @xcite .",
    "what we have done in our work is the characterization of demazure crystal bases in terms of extended young diagrams ( theorem [ demcry ] ) .",
    "one of the advantages to do so is that we can make the most of earlier efforts toward the evaluations of so called 1-dimensional configuration sums @xcite .",
    "recent results on fermionic expressions are also available .",
    "we would like to note here that after we had obtained the fermionic expression ( theorem [ th3 ] ) , we came to know schilling also had the same result @xcite .",
    "however , we have included our proof since it is different from that of schilling . as a corollary of the characterization theorem",
    ", we evaluate the characters of demazure modules ( theorem [ fermionic ] and [ demch ] ) .      in section 1",
    ", we define the basic combinatorial objects in this work : paths and extended young diagrams .",
    "we then describe the crystal structure of the integrable highest weight module of @xmath18 . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the demazure modules , and characterize their crystals via paths or extended young diagrams . in section 3 , we review 1-dimensional configuration sums and rewrite them into fermionic forms . using them",
    "we can express demazure characters .",
    "we also discuss some specializations and compare them with sanderson s results .",
    "section 4 contains a short discussion .",
    "in this section we recall the basic combinatorial objects used in this work : the paths , and extended young diagrams .",
    "next , we outline the realization of the crystal base of an integrable @xmath0-module in terms of these objects",
    ". we also list some properties of the crystal base which we will need in the sequel .",
