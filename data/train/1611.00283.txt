    "understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the most challenging problems in cosmology .",
    "it is now quite well known that the galaxy properties depend on the environment .",
    "the elliptical galaxies are known to preferentially reside in rich clusters whereas the spiral galaxies are mostly distributed in the fields @xcite .",
    "analysis of the two - point correlation function of galaxies @xcite also suggests that the ellipticals are strongly clustered as compared to the spirals .",
    "the genus statistics of the red galaxies which are predominantly ellipticals show a shift towards a meatball topology @xcite indicating their preference for the high density environments .",
    "a study of the filamentarity of the galaxy distribution @xcite in the sdss dr1 indicates that the ellipticals preferentially inhabit the nodes where the filaments intersect whereas the spirals are sparsely distributed along the filaments . besides morphology ,",
    "many other galaxy properties such as luminosity , colour , star formation rate , star formation history , stellar mass , size , metallicity and agn activity are known to strongly depend on the environment @xcite .    in the current paradigm ,",
    "the dark matter first collapses hierarchically into halos and the baryons settle down later at the centres of these halos to form galaxies by cooling and condensation @xcite . in the halo model @xcite ,",
    "all galaxies are believed to form and reside in virialized dark matter halos .",
    "the halo model postulates that the number and type of galaxies residing in a dark matter halo are entirely determined by its mass .",
    "if these halos evolve in isolation , the galaxy properties are largely determined at birth by the initial conditions at the locations where they formed .",
    "but in the hierarchical model , smaller halos merge to form bigger halos and the galaxy properties evolve according to the nature of their mergers .",
    "the environmental effects such as ram pressure striping and different types of galaxy - galaxy interactions are thus expected to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "traditionally , the environment of a galaxy is characterized by the local density which describes the neighbourhood of the host halo where the galaxy is embedded .",
    "however the host halos themselves may be embedded in filaments , sheets or clusters and many of the properties of the host halos such as their masses , shapes and spins are determined by their large - scale cosmic environment @xcite .",
    "so in principle the large - scale environment can indirectly influence the properties of the galaxies . using sdss dr7 data , @xcite",
    "find a significant dependence of the properties of late type brightest group galaxies on their large - scale environment .",
    "a study of the star formation rates in compact groups from the sdss dr7 @xcite find significant difference in the star formation rates between isolated groups and the groups which are embedded in superstructures .",
    "@xcite analyzed the filamentarity of the galaxy distribution from the sdss dr5 and find that the average filamentarity of the star forming galaxies are higher than the red galaxies .",
    "@xcite find that the presence of filamentary environment elevates the fraction of star forming galaxies in the past at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath3 of the extremely metal poor galaxies reside in sheets and voids .",
    "@xcite analyzed the galaxies from the sdss dr4 to find that the role of the large - scale density in determining galaxy properties is minimal once luminosity and morphology are fixed .",
    "@xcite find no dependence of the galaxy properties on the tidal environment of large scale structures in the sdss dr7 . at present , the roles of the large - scale environment in determining the galaxy properties are less clear and there is no consensus on this issue .    in this letter",
    "we propose an information theoretic framework to study the dependence of the galaxy properties on the large - scale environment .",
    "we apply this method to the galaxy zoo project @xcite to investigate if there is any correlation between the galaxy morphology and the large - scale environment .",
    "more than @xmath4 volunteers in the internet participated in this project and classified @xmath0 million galaxies according to their morphology by visual inspection .",
    "the morphological classification by direct visual inspection avoids many of the potential biases associated with the proxies for morphology .",
    "thus the galaxy zoo provides an unique opportunity to test the large scale environmental dependence of the morphology of the galaxies .",
    "the method proposed here can be also applied to test the large scale environmental dependence of any other galaxy properties .    a brief outline of the letter follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the method of analysis followed by a description of the data in section 3 .",
    "we present the results and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we construct a galaxy sample in a cubic region containing @xmath5 galaxies with known morphology .",
    "we divide the cubic region into @xmath6 three dimensional rectangular grids .",
    "the entire sample is now divided into a number of regular cubic voxels of grid size @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the number of resulting voxels for a grid size of @xmath9 .",
    "our sample consists only the spiral and the elliptical galaxies and does not include the galaxies with uncertain morphology .",
    "one can count the number of different types of galaxies in each of the @xmath8 voxels for grid size @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively be the number of spiral and elliptical galaxies residing in the @xmath12 voxel then @xmath13 is the total number of galaxies in the @xmath12 voxel .",
    "summing over all the @xmath8 voxels gives @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath5 are the total number of spirals , total number of ellipticals and the total number of galaxies in the sample respectively .",
    "we define two discrete random variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 with probability distributions @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the probability that a randomly drawn galaxy resides in the @xmath12 voxel .",
    "@xmath21 has a total @xmath8 outcomes .",
    "@xmath24 is the probability that a randomly chosen galaxy is spiral or elliptical and it has @xmath25 outcomes given by @xmath26 for spiral and @xmath27 for elliptical .",
    "we vary the grid size @xmath9 within a suitable range and estimate the probability distributions @xmath21 in each case .",
    "it may be noted here that we consider a cubic region for our analysis as it allows us to use the entire sample while dividing it into different number of rectangular voxels for different grid sizes and keep the total number of galaxies same in each case .      in information theory ,",
    "the information entropy @xmath28 @xcite is the average amount of information required to describe a random variable @xmath29 and is defined as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability of @xmath12 outcome and @xmath32 is the total number of outcome . here",
    "the base of the logarithm is arbitrary and we chose it to be 10 for the present work .",
    "for the pair of random variables @xmath33 with joint probability distribution @xmath34 the joint entropy @xmath35 is defined as , @xmath36 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the random variables introduced earlier . the joint probability that a randomly selected galaxy resides in the @xmath12 voxel and is spiral or elliptical is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the conditional probability that the randomly selected galaxy is spiral or elliptical given that it resides in the @xmath12 voxel .",
    "this gives @xmath39 for @xmath40 ( spiral ) and @xmath41 for @xmath42 ( elliptical ) .",
    "the mutual information @xmath43 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is then defined as , @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the individual entropies associated with the variable x and y respectively . @xmath47 as @xmath48 with equality only if the random variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 are independent .",
    "the mutual information is also symmetric in @xmath19 and @xmath20 i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath50 provides the self information .",
    "we vary the grid size and estimate @xmath43 in each case .",
    "the mutual information measures how much one random variable tells us about another .",
    "it can be thought of as the reduction in uncertainty about one random variable given the knowledge of another .",
    "a high value of mutual information corresponds to large reduction in uncertainty and low value indicates a small reduction in it .",
    "a zero mutual information indicates that the two random variables are independent .",
    "we also estimate the mutual information between the environments on different length scales . we define another random variable @xmath51 analogous to @xmath19 which characterizes the environment of the galaxy on an another scale . the mutual information between environments on different length scales @xmath52 is similarly defined as , @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the the number of voxels for grid sizes @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the joint probability @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of galaxies shared by the @xmath12 voxel of grid size @xmath56 and @xmath60 voxel of grid size @xmath57 .",
    "the joint entropy @xmath61 is similarly defined as , @xmath62 we vary the grid size and estimate @xmath52 for each choice of @xmath63 .      a positive mutual information between morphology and environment does not necessarily imply a causal dependence of morphology on environment .",
    "the mutual information between morphology and environment may come from the shared mutual information between different environmental properties such as the environments on different scales . to investigate this further",
    ", we calculate the conditional mutual information between the morphology and environment .",
    "the conditional mutual information provides the expected value of the mutual information between two random variables given that we have the knowledge of a third random variable .",
    "in particular here we are interested in the mutual information between galaxy morphology and the environment on a particular scale given that we have the knowledge of the environment of the galaxy on a different scale .",
    "the conditional mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath20 given the value of @xmath51 is defined as , @xmath64    applying the chain rule of probability one can write the joint probability @xmath65 which will be @xmath66 for @xmath40 and @xmath67 for @xmath42 . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are respectively the numbers of spirals and ellipticals shared by the @xmath12 voxel of size @xmath56 and @xmath60 voxel of size @xmath57 .",
    "the joint entropy @xmath70 is defined as , @xmath71 the conditional mutual information is always non - negative .",
    "it is zero only when the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is entirely due to the influence of @xmath51 .",
    "we vary the grid size and estimate @xmath72 for each choice of @xmath63 .",
    "one can define the interaction information @xcite as , @xmath73 which measures the loss or gain in information between @xmath19 and @xmath20 due to the additional knowledge of the third random variable @xmath51 .",
    "conditioning on @xmath51 may increase , decrease or not change the mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , @xmath74 may be positive , negative or zero .",
    "@xmath75 indicates that conditioning on @xmath51 weakens the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 whereas @xmath76 indicates that @xmath51 enhances the correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "if conditioning on @xmath51 does not affect the mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath20 then @xmath77 .",
    "we have used a @xmath78cdm cosmological model with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 throughout .",
    "the galaxy zoo @xcite data can be directly accessed from the sdss dr12 skyserver database .",
    "we download the data from the sdss dr12 database using a structured query language ( sql ) search .",
    "we identify a contiguous region spanning @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the right ascension and declination respectively .",
    "we extract all the galaxies in this contiguous region which lies in the redshift range @xmath86 and are brighter than a limiting r - band petrosian magnitude @xmath87 .",
    "these cuts produce a sample with @xmath88 galaxies of which @xmath89 are classified .",
    "we construct a volume limited sample by restricting the extinction corrected and k - corrected r - band absolute magnitude to @xmath90 .",
    "the resulting volume limited sample extends upto a redshift @xmath91 and consists of @xmath92 galaxies with visual morphological classification .",
    "it may be noted here that we have only considered the galaxies which are visually classified as spiral or elliptical and discarded all the galaxies with uncertain morphology .",
    "finally from this volume limited sample we extract a cubic region with sides @xmath93 which contain a total @xmath94 galaxies out of which @xmath95 are spirals and @xmath96 are ellipticals .",
    "we show the mutual information @xmath43 between the morphology and environment of galaxies as a function of length scales in the top left panel of figure .",
    "it shows the presence of a non - zero mutual information between morphology and environment which decreases with increasing length scales but persists throughout the entire length scales probed .",
    "it is important to understand the origin of this non - zero mutual information between morphology and environment . to investigate this further",
    ", we compute the conditional mutual information @xmath72 between morphology and environment at each length scales by conditioning the environment at other length scales .",
    "the mutual and the conditional mutual information were then used to calculate the interaction information @xmath74 shown in the bottom right panel of .",
    "we find that conditioning the environment on @xmath97 leads to a positive interaction between morphology and environment at all the other scales .",
    "as we condition the environment on successively larger scales we observe the same trend upto @xmath98 .",
    "the interaction information becomes negative at all length scales when the environment is conditioned on scales beyond @xmath98 .",
    "it may be noted that all the diagonal boxes exhibit negative interactions .",
    "conditioning the environment on the same scale where the interaction is measured would give @xmath99 leading to a negative interaction information . in the top right panel of we again separately show the magnitudes of the interaction information at each length scale when the environment is conditioned at different scales .",
    "this again clearly shows that the degree of positive interaction between the morphology ( @xmath20 ) and environment ( @xmath19 ) decreases with an increase in the scale at which the environment ( @xmath51 ) is conditioned .",
    "the interaction information diminishes nearly to @xmath100 when the environment ( @xmath51 ) is conditioned at @xmath101 .",
    "as noted earlier , a further increase in the scale for conditioning @xmath51 leads to negative interaction between the morphology and environment on all scales .",
    "it may be noted that the grid sizes for @xmath19 and @xmath51 are decided by the choice of the number of grids used to divide the cubic region .    a positive interaction information",
    "imply ` synergy ' and a negative interaction information imply ` redundancy ' in the interaction between the random variables @xcite .",
    "so a positive interaction between @xmath19 and @xmath20 given the knowledge of @xmath51 indicates that when @xmath51 is known , the knowledge of @xmath19 provides additional information on @xmath20 than that provided by @xmath19 and @xmath51 individually . on the other hand ,",
    "a negative interaction between @xmath19 and @xmath20 given the knowledge of @xmath51 tells us that when @xmath51 is known , the knowledge of @xmath19 does not tell us anything new about @xmath20 .",
    "conditioning @xmath51 upto a length scales of @xmath98 introduces positive interaction between @xmath19 and @xmath20 on larger scales and negative interaction on smaller scales .",
    "this indicates that conditioning the environment on a particular scale plays an important role in the apparent interaction between morphology and environment .",
    "the fact that the interaction between @xmath19 and @xmath20 becomes negative on all scales when @xmath51 is conditioned on a scale beyond @xmath98 suggests that no information is shared between morphology and environment beyond this length scale .",
    "further the mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath20 on scales below @xmath98 does not arise due to a causal interaction between them .",
    "rather they are the outcome of a non - zero mutual information between the environments on different scales . and together suggest that a larger mutual information between the environments on different scales would produce a smaller conditional mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath20 given @xmath51 .",
    "consequently the interaction information @xmath74 would reduce when both @xmath52 and @xmath43 are larger and enhance when @xmath52 is larger but @xmath43 is smaller . in the bottom left panel of we",
    "show the mutual information @xmath102 shared by the environments on different scales .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath51 are much larger than the mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath20 on each scale .",
    "furthermore the mutual information between @xmath19 and @xmath51 decreases with increasing length scales and reduces by more than a factor of half beyond a scale of @xmath98 . combining these results",
    "we conclude that the observed apparent interaction between morphology and environment of a galaxy are most likely caused by the shared mutual information between the environments on different scales and they cease to exist beyond a length scales of @xmath103 .    finally we note that the method presented here provides an effective avenue to explore the large scale environmental dependence of galaxy properties from a new perspective . in future",
    ", we plan to carry out a detail study of the large scale environmental dependence of a number of other galaxy properties using the sdss @xcite .",
    "such a study will clearly reveal any influence of the large - scale environment on the other galaxy properties and their evolution .",
