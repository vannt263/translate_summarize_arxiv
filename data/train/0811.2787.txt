    "<S> the puzzle of the thermodynamic arrow of time reduces to the question of how the universe could have had lower entropy in the past . </S>",
    "<S> i show that no special entropy lowering mechanism ( or fluctuation ) is necessary . as a consequence of expansion , at a particular epoch in the history of the universe </S>",
    "<S> a state that was near maximum entropy under the dominant short range forces becomes extremely unlikely , due to a switchover to newly dominant long range forces . </S>",
    "<S> this happened at about the time of decoupling , prior to which i make no statement about arrows . </S>",
    "<S> the role of cosmology in thermodynamics was first suggested by t. gold .     </S>",
    "<S> = 11 auxout  = 12    the thermodynamic arrow of time , basically the second law of thermodynamics , is often said to be one of the mysteries of nature , standing in stark contrast to the near time - symmetry of other dynamical laws accepted in physics .    </S>",
    "<S> this article is less ambitious than other recent discussions of the problem , for example , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i only want to explain the observed phenomenon in terms of other known and accepted pieces of physics . </S>",
    "<S> i will not go to the very early universe ( not even the first millennium ) , nor will i invoke unobserved phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> what i do assert is that there is less mystery than is alleged . </S>",
    "<S> the essential features of this argument have already appeared both in my own writings @xcite and in the writings of others @xcite . in the present article </S>",
    "<S> i will review and extend these arguments .    </S>",
    "<S> as foreshadowed , the explanation will involve cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding the asserted limited scope , the claim is far from trivial : it relates local thermodynamics to the universe at large , a connection that is neither obvious nor intuitive . </S>",
    "<S> this leads me to a secondary objective of this presentation , namely to trace the origin of these ideas to their proper source , namely thomas gold , who in at least some of the current literature is either ignored or misquoted .    </S>",
    "<S> around 1960 , 30 years after the discovery of the expansion of the universe , gold suggested @xcite that the thermodynamic arrow was a consequence of that expansion . that this was a significant step can be seen in an earlier article by wheeler and feynman in which they start from a time - symmetric electrodynamics and recover the usual time - asymmetric theory by means of their `` absorber theory '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their work deals in an essential way with the issue of irreversibility ( for example in presenting a framework for dirac s calculation of radiation reaction @xcite ) and in some of their attempts to establish the absorber theory wheeler and feynman make reference to the universe at large . nevertheless , the essential feature , that the universe is _ expanding _ , comes nowhere in their article . ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite even mentions discussion with einstein . </S>",
    "<S> this was in the 1940 s and expansion did not seem the route to solving this great puzzle . for context </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to read the record of a conference convened by gold and bondi @xcite in 1963 . some participants were sympathetic to the idea that expansion could play a role ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; many were not .    in any case , the arguments of gold indicated ways in which large scale expansion could be felt locally . </S>",
    "<S> he reasoned @xcite that any local arrow is imposed by an outside influence , with the ultimate outside influence being the expansion of the universe , manifested through outgoing wave electromagnetic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> although i found his thesis attractive , i felt @xcite that a proper presentation of his argument required time - symmetric boundary conditions . in the present article a slightly different approach is taken , based on actual observation of earlier states of the universe , combined with known dynamical processes .    </S>",
    "<S> it was realized long ago by boltzmann that the problem of justifying the arrow was not so much showing that the entropy of isolated systems increased ( accomplished with controversy by his h - theorem ) , but explaining why there was low entropy in the past . </S>",
    "<S> his justification @xcite was that there was an enormous `` fluctuation . '' for most of the universe and for most of its history it is in equilibrium , but at some point in our past there was a fluctuation leading to our present situation . </S>",
    "<S> it is hard to argue with this assertion ; it is also hard to believe . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite , notes to sec .  4.0 , and many other discussions .    </S>",
    "<S> i now argue that what we already know about the history of the universe provides that low entropy , and it occurs by virtue of the expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the era of recombination or decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> for that epoch , we have an excellent image of the universe , namely that provided by the cosmic background radiation . </S>",
    "<S> it shows , for the luminous matter , a tremendous level ( 1 part in 10@xmath0 ) of uniformity . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable . under short range forces , for example the usual intermolecular interactions , the most likely state , that of maximum entropy , is uniformity . </S>",
    "<S> forces were short range prior to recombination because the system was basically a plasma . </S>",
    "<S> although electromagnetic forces are long range , because of the presence of uncancelled positive and negative charges there was screening of the electromagnetic forces , making them effectively short range . </S>",
    "<S> of course gravitational forces were also present , but for luminous matter they were negligible . </S>",
    "<S> for dark matter , it is generally felt that at that time there must already have been some level of non - uniformity , but that does not affect our argument . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , there is no evidence for the presence of black holes . to summarize the significant observation : </S>",
    "<S> the luminous matter was in equilibrium under its dominant forces and that equilibrium was a uniform state .    with the advent of recombination , </S>",
    "<S> charged particles combined to form neutral objects , h atoms , and the universe became transparent . </S>",
    "<S> atom - atom forces were also negligible since particle separations were on the order of mm . </S>",
    "<S> gravity now became the dominant force . </S>",
    "<S> under gravity , uniformity is _ not _ the most likely state . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , matter tends to clump , in fact it seems to do so hierarchically . </S>",
    "<S> the uniform distribution that in an earlier era was the most likely configuration , now becomes unstable .    </S>",
    "<S> this then is the punch line : with no mechanism other than expansion , entropy has been lowered . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it s not the state that changes , but the dominant forces . </S>",
    "<S> what was maximum entropy in one regime becomes low entropy in another . and </S>",
    "<S> this happens because of expansion , since it s expansion that induces the cooling , causing in turn the formation of h atoms , and finally leading to a world in which the newly dominant force  gravity  controls a state that is unlikely from a gravitational perspective . </S>",
    "<S> this then is gold s thesis , although the detailed arguments are different .    </S>",
    "<S> getting from this state of disequilibrium to our experienced arrow of time is qualitatively straightforward , although quantitatively challenging . under gravitational forces </S>",
    "<S> there is a continuing emergence of ever greater levels of non - uniformity . </S>",
    "<S> eventually this gives rise to star formation and the release of nuclear energy . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn leads to the negentropy flow that permits the preparation of local low entropy states . in our case , this negentropy flow takes the form of 6000@xmath1k photons that allow us to remain out of equilibrium on earth .    </S>",
    "<S> establishing this picture quantitatively is the objective of the fields of structure formation and stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> puzzles in the former area suggest that , as remarked above , a degree of structure was already present before recombination . presumably , this would ultimately have led to the high degree of non - uniformity that we see today , but it would not have done so on the observed time scale ( about 13 billion years ) . </S>",
    "<S> this presumption , however , applies to a fictional world sans expansion : in our world , expansion implies decoupling , the trigger for the relatively rapid development of non - uniformity .    </S>",
    "<S> the foregoing argument says nothing about a thermodynamic arrow _ before _ recombination . perhaps there was none or perhaps it was there because of even earlier physical processes . </S>",
    "<S> we offer no opinion on this issue , since this paper is devoted to explaining the thermodynamic arrow we now experience.having or not having an arrow need not be a yes - or - no issue . for example , one would say that a gas _ at _ equilibrium has no arrow , while a gas released from a small volume surely does . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that rate of change of entropy be a quantitative measure of an arrow . </S>",
    "<S> however , this too has pitfalls . for a metastable system described by stochastic dynamics </S>",
    "<S> the derivative may be small ( fixed by the second largest eigenvalue of the matrix of transition probabilities @xcite ) while for any particular exemplar the apparent changes may be great ( after a nucleation event ) or seemingly nonexistent ( in the absence of such an event ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the systems discussed here there are two differences from the scenario just mentioned . </S>",
    "<S> first , with long range forces entropy is problematic . </S>",
    "<S> second , the nucleation events are _ not _ sudden and local , but may occur at large distance scales . </S>",
    "<S> as such , on smaller scales ( where entropy may be defined in a local sense ) there will be no perceivable arrow . ]    finally a comment about the term `` adiabatic '' when used in connection with the post - decoupling expansion of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> i mention this because in the discussion in @xcite the expansion is characterized as rapid . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , adiabatic , suggesting a slow process , is appropriate when considering the ability of the photon gas to keep up with the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the clumping process , that which ultimately leads to stars , etc . , is far slower than the expansion . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> as the universe expands , it does not manage to reach the state of greatest likelihood associated with gravity - dominated dynamics ( which may not exist ) .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> i have given qualitative arguments . </S>",
    "<S> to what extent can greater precision be obtained ? </S>",
    "<S> this could be in the form of better estimates of inhomogeneity , or perhaps model systems exhibiting the features i postulate . </S>",
    "<S> frankly , for my purposes i do nt think this is necessary , and for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , behind my assertions are decades of experience and calculations by many , many people . </S>",
    "<S> gravity makes things clump ; of course much more than that is known , time scales under various conditions and the like , but this is greater precision than i need . </S>",
    "<S> second , i am not predicting inhomogeneity ; i am observing it . </S>",
    "<S> the evident property of gravity to head toward such a configuration is essential to my argument , but for that argument it is enough simply to observe that uniformity and gravity are at odds .    </S>",
    "<S> similar remarks apply to models , but discussing the phenomenon in phase transition terms is instructive . consider a hamiltonian with both short and long range interparticle forces . </S>",
    "<S> if there is short - range repulsion and it is bounded in magnitude , there may very well may be no stable state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the long - range force is much weaker than the other , there can be a long - lived ( uniform density ) metastable phase . </S>",
    "<S> the passage out of this metastable state can be considered a phase transition , from something that looks like equilibrium under short - range forces to something for which the dynamics never comes to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> note that i am not saying that the actual universe suddenly passed through such a transition . </S>",
    "<S> what i mean by `` phase transition '' is the dramatic dependence of system behavior on a parameter . in our case </S>",
    "<S> we could take the parameter to be the strength of the short range force . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of the metastable phase would then drop rapidly as the short range force weakened . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we considered the plasma ( sans dark matter ) that preceded recombination but in a _ _ non__expanding universe , the lifetime for gravity to take over and cause clumping would be extremely long . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the short range coupling constant is reduced ( as it is , because of cooling and expansion ) , then that lifetime has the dramatic reduction that one associates with a phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> i review what has or has not been explained here . </S>",
    "<S> i have _ not _ explained why the universe was in a metastable state prior to recombination , a state in which not only the inhomogeneity of the gravitational dominance was absent , but the ultimate inhomogeneity of black holes was also absent . </S>",
    "<S> what i _ have _ explained is how the state that is in fact observed leads to the second law of thermodynamics , as we now see it . </S>",
    "<S> my point is thus the connection or correlation of two observed phenomena . in one sentence </S>",
    "<S> i restate the explanation : expansion - induced cooling shifted the strength - balance of long and short range forces , allowing nucleation of a matter distribution that is clumpy and appears to have no ultimate equilibrium . or more loosely speaking , what _ was _ high entropy with respect to the dominant forces becomes low entropy by virtue of an expansion - induced change in which forces dominate .    </S>",
    "<S> as declared at the outset , the scope of the explanation offered here is more modest than that of other recent attempts . </S>",
    "<S> there is good reason to be conservative . </S>",
    "<S> the field of cosmology undergoes major revisions of its paradigms with impressive frequency . </S>",
    "<S> a great deal of modern cosmology is concerned with properties of black holes , and for the topic at hand focuses particularly on their entropic properties . </S>",
    "<S> as far as i know there is no experimental or observational evidence on this matter , nor is there a shred of evidence , beyond theoretical conviction , for the existence of radiation from black holes .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , the existence of the observed thermodynamic arrow of time has been traced to observed and non - controversial features of the not - too - early universe . </S>",
    "<S> given the state observed at that time , coupled with the expansion of the universe , one obtains the contemporary arrow of time . </S>"
