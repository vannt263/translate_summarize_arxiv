    "the determination of the absolute phase from a fringe pattern is an important problem that finds applications in many areas : homomorphic signal processing  @xcite , solid state physics  @xcite , holographic interferometry  @xcite , adaptive or compensated optics  @xcite , magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite and synthetic aperture radar interferometry  @xcite .    in all these applications one obtains a two - dimensional fringe pattern whose spatially - varying phase is related to the physical quantity to be measured .",
    "the computation of phase by any inverse trigonometric function ( e.g.  arctangent ) provides only principal phase values , which lie between @xmath0 radians .",
    "the process of phase unwrapping ( pu ) , i.e.  the addition of a proper integer multiple of @xmath1 to all the pixels , must be carried out before the physical quantity can be reconstructed from the phase distributions . since many possible absolute phase fields are compatible with a given fringe pattern , phase unwrapping is ill - posed in a mathematical sense : hadamard  @xcite defined a mathematical problem to be well - posed if a unique solution exists that depends continuously on the data ; in this case , the uniqueness requirement is violated .",
    "ill - posed problems arise frequently in many areas of science and engineering ; well - known examples are analytic continuation , the cauchy problem for differential equations , computer tomography , and many problems in image processing and machine vision that involve the reconstruction of images from noisy data .",
    "the fact that a problem is not well - posed does not mean that it can not be solved : rather , in order to be solved it must be first _",
    "regularized _ by introducing additional constraints ( prior knowledge ) about the behaviour of the solution .",
    "variational regularization corresponds to modeling the physical constraints of the problem by a suitable functional ; the solution is then sought as the minimizer of this functional .    in the last years",
    ", an increasing interest has been devoted to adapt methods from statistical mechanics to nonconvex optimization problems arising from the variational regularization of ill - posed problems .",
    "geman and geman  @xcite suggested that the ising model is applicable to image restoration through the bayesian formalism .",
    "this problem corresponds to searching the ground state of a finite - size ising model under a non - uniform external field .",
    "geman and geman applied this to the recovery of corrupted images by using simulated annealing of a spin - s ising model .",
    "after that , gidas  @xcite proposed a new method based on a combination of the renormalization group technique and the simulated annealing procedure ; then , zhang  @xcite introduced mean - field annealing to treat the image reconstruction problem , while tanaka and morita  @xcite applied the cluster variation method .",
    "methods of statistical mechanics have also been used to study combinatorial optimization problems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .    in a couple of recent papers , the phase unwrapping problem was handled by methods of statistical mechanics .",
    "simulated annealing was applied in  @xcite . in  @xcite the problem",
    "is solved by the mean - field annealing ( mfa ) technique ; pu is formulated as a constrained optimization problem for the field of integer corrections to be added to the wrapped phase gradient in order to recover the true phase gradient , with the cost function consisting of second order differences , and measuring the smoothness of the reconstructed phase field .",
    "this is equivalent  @xcite to finding the ground state of a locally - constrained ferromagnetic spin-1 ising model under a non - uniform external field .",
    "the optimization problem is then solved by mfa and consistent solutions are found in difficult situations resulting from noise and undersampling",
    ".    mean field annealing is closely related to simulated annealing  @xcite .",
    "both approaches formulate the optimization problem in terms of minimizing a cost function and defining a corresponding gibbs distribution .",
    "simulated annealing then proceeds by sampling the gibbs probability distribution as the temperature is reduced to zero , whereas mfa attempts to track an approximation of the mean of the same distribution .",
    "the algorithm described in  @xcite was constructed under the assumption that the possible values for the correction field were restricted to belong to the set @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we generalize the mfa algorithm to the case of a set @xmath3 , with @xmath4 an arbitrary integer .",
    "the corresponding statistical system is a locally - constrained spin - l ising model .",
    "the present generalization allows the processing of input phase patterns with arbitrary degree of undersampling ; our experiments on synthetic phase fields show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pu ] the phase unwrapping problem is introduced and its ill - posedness is highlighted . in sect .",
    "[ sec : alg ] the deterministic mfa algorithm is described in detail .",
    "then , in sect .  [ sec : exp ] some experimental results on simulated phase fields are presented .",
    "some conclusions are then drawn in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "we briefly recall here the phase unwrapping terminology , and refer the reader to  @xcite for a complete discussion .    given an absolute phase pattern @xmath5 on a two - dimensional square grid , what is actually measured is the wrapped phase field @xmath6 which can be expressed in terms of the @xmath7 field through a wrapping operator , wr , defined so that @xmath6 always lies in the interval @xmath8 : @xmath9 = \\arg \\left\\ { \\exp [ \\mathrm{i }       f(x , y)]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] phase unwrapping means recovering the absolute phase field @xmath7 , which is usually related to the physical quantity to be measured , from the knowledge of the @xmath10 field .",
    "this can be done in practice by estimating the absolute phase gradient from the wrapped phase field and integrating it throughout the 2-d grid .",
    "this simple method is effective only in absence of phase aliasing , i.e.  if the phase field is correctly sampled .",
    "in fact , if the nyquist condition : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the discrete gradient , is verified everywhere on the grid , the absolute phase gradient is obtained by wrapping the gradient of the wrapped phase field , according to the formula : @xmath13.\\ ] ] as mentioned , if condition   is satisfied , one has : @xmath14 and the @xmath7-pattern is obtained by integrating @xmath15 along any path connecting all sites on the grid .    the nyquist condition is often violated because of undersampling of the signal from which the principal phase is extracted .",
    "this can result either from system noise , or from critical values of the slopes of the physical surface which is analyzed through interferometry .",
    "for example , in the case of sar interferometry , the surface is the portion of earth imaged from the sensor ( usually air- or satellite - borne ) , while noise can arise from sensor thermal electronic motion , or from other sources of electronic signal disturbances .",
    "if the nyquist condition is not satisfied everywhere on the grid , then the wrapped gradient @xmath15 of the wrapped phase field is not assured to equal the absolute phase gradient . in this case , a more general relation must be written , rather than  , i.e. : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a vector field of integers . in this case , solving pu amounts to finding the correct field @xmath18 .",
    "phase aliasing conditions imply that the integration of field @xmath15 depends on the path .",
    "the sources of this nonconservative behaviour are detectable by calculating the integral of the field @xmath15 over every minimum closed path , i.e.  the 2@xmath192 square having the site @xmath20 as a corner : @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{eq : resdef}\\ ] ] one can show that the integral @xmath22 will always have a value in the set @xmath23 .",
    "locations with @xmath24 are called `` residues '' . in presence of residues ,",
    "the field @xmath15 is no more irrotational ; this causes the path - dependence of the integration step previously described .    to restore the consistency of the phase gradient ,",
    "then , the @xmath18 field must satisfy the following consistency condition : @xmath25 = 0 ,      \\label{eq : consist}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the discrete curl operator .",
    "since there are many possible @xmath18 fields satisfying eq .  , pu is an ill - posed problem according to hadamard s definition .",
    "one of the most classical and widely - used algorithms for phase unwrapping is the least mean squares ( lms ) approach  @xcite , which consists in finding the scalar field @xmath7 whose gradient is closer to @xmath15 in the least squares sense , i.e.  the minimizer of : @xmath27 as mentioned before , in  @xcite a variational approach has been used , and the field @xmath18 was `` chosen '' as the minimizer of the following functional : @xmath28 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad & +      { 1\\over 4\\pi^2 }       \\sum               \\left [              \\nabla_{y } f(x , y+1 ) - \\nabla_{y } f(x , y )               \\right]^2 \\nonumber \\\\          & \\qquad & + { 1\\over 4\\pi^2}\\sum              \\left [              \\nabla_{x } f(x , y+1 ) - \\nabla_{x } f(x , y )              \\right]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad & +          { 1\\over 4\\pi^2}\\sum              \\left [              \\nabla_{y } f(x+1,y ) - \\nabla_{y } f(x , y )              \\right]^2 ,      \\label{eq : nostro }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to constraint  . due to",
    ", @xmath29 is a functional of @xmath18 , i.e.  @xmath30 $ ] , and it measures the smoothness of the reconstructed phase surface .",
    "the optimization problem was then solved by a mfa algorithm under the assumption that the @xmath18 field be restricted to take values in @xmath23 . in the next section",
    "we generalize the mfa algorithm to the case of @xmath18 fields belonging to @xmath3 , with @xmath4 an arbitrary integer .",
    "as explained in sect .  [ sec : pu ] , we assume the solution of pu to be the minimizer of the functional  , subject to constraint  .",
    "let us assume that the possible values of the @xmath18 field are restricted to belong to @xmath3 .",
    "the field @xmath18 may then be regarded as a system of spin - l units .",
    "we assume the gibbs distribution : @xmath31 = \\frac{\\exp\\left [ \\frac{-r[{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{k}}}]}{t } \\right ] }          { \\sum_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{k } } } ' } \\exp \\left [ \\frac{-r[{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{k}}}']}{t }           \\right]},\\ ] ] where the sum is over the @xmath32 fields satisfying  , and @xmath33 is the statistical temperature .",
    "inconsistent fields @xmath32 are assumed to have zero probability .    following mean - field theory  @xcite",

    "let @xmath34 be the probability that @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 be the corresponding probability for @xmath38 .",
    "normalization of these marginal probabilities implies a penalty functional : @xmath39 = \\sum_{(x , y ) } \\biggl [ v_x(x , y ) \\left(1 -       \\sum_{\\alpha } \\rho_x(x , y,\\alpha ) \\right ) +       v_y(x , y ) \\left(1 -       \\sum_{\\alpha } \\rho_y(x , y,\\alpha ) \\right ) \\biggr],\\ ] ] where @xmath40 are lagrange multipliers .",

    "according to the variational principle of statistical mechanics , the best approximation to the gibbs distribution is the minimizer of the free energy  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath54 is a convex functional , the free energy is convex at high temperature and the global minimum can be easily attained .",
