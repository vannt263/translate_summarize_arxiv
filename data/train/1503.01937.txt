    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are multifunctional materials that combine the outstanding electronic and optical properties of semiconductors with highly controllable magnetic properties . @xcite with the prospect of spintronic applications of dms in mind , much effort has focused recently on the study of ultrafast spin dynamics and control .",
    "@xcite at the same time , spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) effects have been intensely studied in non - magnetic bulk and nanostructured semiconductors .",
    "@xcite the interplay between the exchange interaction characteristic of dms and the more generic soi can lead to new possibilities for applications and basic research .",
    "@xcite in particular , the spin - orbit torque effect in dms has attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "@xcite    in this article we explore theoretically this interplay by studying the ultrafast spin dynamics of a non - equilibrium electron distribution in the conduction band of ii - vi mn - doped semiconductors .",
    "our work is based on a microscopic density - matrix theory that models on a quantum - kinetic level the spin precession and the spin transfer between electrons in the conduction band of such semiconductors and the manganese electrons , and which accounts for exchange - induced correlations beyond the mean - field level and considers the localized character of the mn spins.@xcite this recently developed formalism is quite general and can be computationally costly to apply in some circumstances .",
    "for this reason , in the present study we consider a particular situation which is nevertheless experimentally relevant and theoretically interesting : the limit of high mn density compared to the electron density , which is normally realized in photoexcitation experiments . in this particular regime",
    "we can apply a simplified formalism which captures the essential physics that is relevant here and which reduces greatly the numerical effort.@xcite    the purpose of our study is to determine under which conditions , if any , the spin - orbit interaction mechanisms present in semiconductors can become relevant or even dominant in the picosecond time - scale spin dynamics in dms . as will be seen here , for both bulk and quasi - two - dimensional systems , depending on the choice of material parameters and excitation conditions",
    ", there can be a strong interplay or competition between the two types of interactions .",
    "this rather unexplored combined effect between exchange and soi in dms could lead in principle to new forms of spin control suitable for spintronic applications .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] we present the model hamiltonian of the dms with spin - orbit interaction and in section [ sec : eq_motion ] we review the equations of motion that describe the spin dynamics in the formalism adopted here . in sections",
    "[ sec : bulk ] and [ sec : quantum_well ] we present and discuss our results for bulk zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se and for hg@xmath3mn@xmath2cd@xmath4te quantum wells , respectively .",

    "the theoretical model of dms for our work includes the exchange @xmath0-coupling between electrons in the conduction band and @xmath5-electrons of the doping mn atoms and the soi of conduction - band electrons expressed in the envelope - function approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 , with conduction - band effective mass @xmath8 , and the kondo - like hamiltonian @xcite @xmath9 describes the coupling due to the exchange interaction between the conduction - band electrons and the mn electrons .",

    "[ ] , [ ] , and [ ] , the heisenberg equations of motion of the density matrix for dms without soi were posed and analyzed in terms of a correlation hierarchy which includes averaging of the mn - atom positions , thus rendering the problem spatially homogeneous . in this work",
    "we follow that formalism and extend it in a simple fashion in order to study the effects of the soi on the electronic spin degree of freedom .    when the number of mn atoms ( @xmath23 ) is much larger than the number of conduction - band electrons ( @xmath24 ) , i.e.  in the limit @xmath25 , the quantum kinetic equations established in ref .",

    "here we consider electrons excited with typical narrow - band laser pulses with near - bandgap energies and low intensities .",
    "employing the approximation of low - electron density as compared to the mn doping density , we have developed a simplified formalism @xcite based on the full model of ref .",

    "we first examine numerically and analytically the dephasing caused by the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling and then we proceed to calculate and analyze the full dynamics under the influence of both exchange coupling and soi .          as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] , the spin - orbit interaction in the envelope - function approximation plays the role of an effective @xmath20-dependent magnetic field around which the electron spin precesses .",

    "[ fig:3d_so_nomn ] , which corresponds to the equilibrium distribution caused by the soi effective field dephasing , is given by the value 1/3 : @xmath64 this equilibrium value can be understood analytically as follows .",

    "note again that in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_so_nomn ] the curve corresponding to the excitation above the band edge displays a non - monotonic behavior which is the precursor of an oscillation that can be seen under stronger soi .",

    "( [ eq : soi_oscillation ] ) , appropriately averaged over the occupied @xmath20-states .",
    "having verified the dephasing caused by the @xmath20-dependent dresselhaus effective magnetic field , we now wish to study the interplay between the exchange @xmath0- ( sd ) and dresselhaus ( d ) couplings .",
    "the material parameters of zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se related to the mn doping used in our simulations are as follows .",
    "the exchange coupling constant of zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se is @xmath77,@xcite where @xmath78 is the number of unit cells per unit volume , and @xmath79 in our notation .",
    "the lattice constant of znse is 0.569  nm , the volume of the primitive unit cell is 0.0455  nm@xmath80 , thus @xmath81 , and then @xmath82 . we assume a relatively low percentage of mn doping of @xmath83 which gives a mn density of @xmath84 .",
    "the density of photoexcited electrons is assumed to be @xmath85 , i.e.  three orders of magnitude lower than the mn density .",
    "we first consider a gaussian distribution for the conduction - band electrons centered at the band edge , and take an average mn magnetization of @xmath86 .",
    "the mn magnetization can be simply tuned by applying an external magnetic field in the desired direction and waiting for the mn spin to reach its thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , we envision an experiment where the magnetic field is turned off before the pump laser pulse arrives .",
    "note that the mn spin - lattice relaxation time is of the order of @xmath87 @xcite which suffices to carry out the ensuing optical excitation experiment studied here under almost constant mn magnetization .",
    "figure [ fig : bulk_bandedge ] shows the time evolution of the parallel , @xmath88 , and perpendicular , @xmath89 , mean spin components . from now on we use only the realistic value @xmath59 for the dresselhaus constant and for concreteness we take the initial spin - polarization rotated 45 degrees with respect to the z - axis .",
    "the specific choice for this angle is not very relevant , but it is important to set it to a value different from zero in order to have spin precession about the mn field . since the dresselhaus hamiltonian is cubic in the wave vector , we expect it to have a relatively weak effect , as compared to the exchange coupling , on electrons populating low - energy states around the band edge , and fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_bandedge ] confirms this expectation .",
    "indeed , we see that for the parallel spin component the presence of the dresselhaus coupling does not modify the dynamics noticeably [ the red - solid line ( sd+d ) and the green dots ( only sd ) are superimposed ] . for the perpendicular components",
    "there is a noticeable difference , but the two curves are still qualitatively similar . we have checked that if the mn concentration and/or the mn magnetization are increased the effect of the spin - orbit coupling becomes rapidly negligible also for the perpendicular spin component . roughly speaking , the exchange @xmath0-coupling can be thought of as causing two main effects : a spin precession about the mean mn magnetization and spin transfer between conduction - band and mn electrons .",
    "on the other hand , as seen above , the dresselhaus spin - orbit hamiltonian , by providing a @xmath20-dependent effective magnetic field , induces a global dephasing in the electron population .",
    "the decay seen in both spin components in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_bandedge ] is thus a result of both exchange - induced spin transfer and spin - orbit dephasing , but the former dominates the dynamics for the chosen set of parameters .",

    "red solid lines correspond to the full calculation ( sd+d ) and green dotted lines to the calculation leaving out the dresselhaus coupling ( only sd ) .",
    ", width=288 ]    this raises the question of whether a parameter regime can be reached experimentally in which the dephasing caused by the spin - orbit effective field has a considerable influence on or even dominates the spin dynamics .",
    "as mentioned above , shifting the optical excitation away from the band edge to higher k - values should enhance the effect of the soi on the spin dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the influence of the exchange @xmath0-coupling can be reduced by lowering both the mn concentration and/or the average mn magnetization .",
    "thus , in fig .  [",
    "fig : bulk_10mev ] we show the time evolution of the parallel and perpendicular spin components like in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_bandedge ] , but centering the gaussian occupation 10 mev above the band edge and reducing the mn magnetization to @xmath92 .",
    "the mn doping is kept at @xmath91 as before , and for the conduction - band electrons we choose again an initial spin orientation rotated 45 degrees away from the z - axis . in the parallel spin component",
    "there is now a noticeable difference between the full calculation ( sd+d ) ( red solid line ) and the sd - only case ( green long - dashed line ) .",
    "a qualitatively new feature is that the combination of @xmath0- and dresselhaus couplings now produces not only a decay but also oscillations , revealing a combined spin precession . in the perpendicular component",
    "the spin - orbit coupling has now an enormous effect , greatly accelerating the decay and causing superimposed oscillations .",
    "the oscillations seen in fig .",

    "it is interesting to elucidate whether a similar spin dynamics would also be obtained in a simpler scenario combining the dresselhaus soi with a constant magnetic field of appropriate strength .",
    "( this type of problem has been studied recently from the point of view of impurity entanglement @xcite and spin relaxation @xcite . )",
    "we can readily answer this question by intentionally leaving the correlation terms out of the equations of motion [ keeping in the rhs of eq .",
    "only the first term of the second line ] thus reverting to a mean - field approximation , which for a given mn magnetization is equivalent to adding a constant magnetic field .",
    "the result is given by the pink dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_10mev ] . for the perpendicular component",
    "we see that the mean - field calculation resembles the full one , although there is a clearly distinguishable difference between them . on the other hand , both results are far away from the @xmath0-only result , and we have to conclude that in this sense the mean - field approximation does capture an important part of the interplay between the exchange and spin - orbit couplings . for the parallel component",
    "the mean - field approximation radically modifies the dynamics .",
    "we see here that when the @xmath0 correlations are removed the spin - orbit dephasing is not capable by itself of inducing a decay in the presence of the spin precession about the mn magnetization . in other words ,",
    "the longitudinal component does not decay since its dresselhaus dephasing is in a sense prevented by the naked ( without exchange - induced correlations ) precession about the mn magnetization . to confirm this point we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk_10mev ] the spin dynamics with only the dresselhaus soi ( no @xmath0-coupling ) with blue dotted lines .",
    "these curves show the strong decay induced by spin - orbit dephasing in the absence of both the spin precession and the spin transfer caused by the exchange coupling .    the origin and frequency of the oscillations mentioned above , which appear when both interactions are present , and in both the full and mean - field calculations , can be interpreted with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : soi_oscillation ] ) . for a given @xmath20-state the precession frequency is now @xmath96 . in the limit",
    "@xmath97 we can assume that @xmath98 , and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evolution_op ] ) and ( [ eq : soi_oscillation ] ) we obtain @xmath99",
    ". this argument applies to every @xmath20-state and thus can be extended to the whole electron population .",
    "then , the precession about the spin - orbit effective magnetic field of the longitudinal component is suppressed by the dominant precession about the mn magnetic field , a feature that can be seen clearly in the mean - field result of fig .  [",
    "fig : bulk_10mev ] .",
    "if the spin - orbit angular frequency is not completely neglected we obtain oscillations in the parallel component with frequency @xmath100 and small amplitude proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "we have verified that increasing the dresselhaus coupling increases the amplitude of the oscillations ( not shown here ) .",
    "oscillations of the same frequency are also present in the perpendicular spin component .",
    "we now turn to the study of the influence of the spin - orbit coupling in ii - vi semiconductor quantum wells . in this case",
    "the soi that we consider is the rashba coupling ( r ) , which is present when the quantum - well confinement lacks inversion symmetry .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the role of the spin - orbit coupling is conceptually similar in bulk and in quantum wells , since in both cases it can be thought of as a @xmath20-dependent zeeman hamiltonian which induces global dephasing in an electron gas .",
    "however , quantum wells offer greater flexibility to control the soi and also display high electron mobilities in high quality modulation - doped samples . high mobilities amount to longer momentum - scattering times and therefore to more coherent quantum dynamics .    in line with the bulk studies discussed above , we first tested the spin dynamics in zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se quantum wells .",
    "for realistic parameters for this material , it turned out that the rashba coupling was too weak to modify the dynamics driven by the exchange @xmath0-coupling .",
    "the root of this difficulty seems to be the large bandgap ( about 2.8 ev ) of znse , which results in a small rashba coupling constant .",
    "thus for the quantum well calculations we looked for a family of materials with stronger and more controllable rashba interaction .",
    "hg@xmath1mn@xmath102te is a good candidate since the energy gap @xmath103 of this ternary compound depends strongly on the mn concentration,@xcite going to zero at @xmath104 , while its spin - orbit valence - band splitting @xmath105 is insensitive to it.@xcite this interesting combination leads to flexible spin - orbit properties , which are generally controlled by the ratio @xmath106 . by choosing a mn concentration slightly above",
    "@xmath107 we can select a very low energy gap , which leads in turn to a strong rashba coupling.@xcite however , this lower limit for the mn concentration is still too high and leads again to a completely dominant exchange interaction even for as low a mn magnetization of @xmath108 ( with @xmath0-coupling induced spin relaxation times below 5 ps ) .",
    "this drawback can be overcome by considering instead the compound hg@xmath3mn@xmath102cd@xmath109te in which the non - magnetic cd atoms replace some of the mn dopants .",
    "this change maintains the gap tunability via the doping fraction @xmath110 giving full flexibility regarding the concentration of magnetic ions.@xcite the rashba coupling constant can be calculated with the expression @xcite @xmath111    we work with the effective mass of hgte , @xmath112,@xcite and take the spin - orbit valence - band splitting as @xmath113.@xcite assuming @xmath114 , a quantum - well width @xmath115 , and a potential energy drop of @xmath116 across the quantum well , we obtain @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",

    "this frequency depends on many factors such as the rashba coefficient , the electron density , and the electronic distribution ( which in our simulations is determined by the mean value and the standard deviation of the initial gaussian population ) .",

    "although our results can be considered generally valid in zincblende semiconductor systems , we focused on particular materials that show clearly the interplay between the two mechanisms : zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se for bulk and hg@xmath3mn@xmath2cd@xmath4te for quantum wells . in our calculations we employed a recently developed formalism which incorporates electronic correlations originated from the exchange @xmath0-coupling .",
    "the main conclusion of our study is that for both bulk and quasi - two - dimensional systems there can be a strong interplay or competition between the two types of interactions , leading to experimentally detectable signatures ( for example in time - resolved faraday and kerr rotation experiments ) of the spin - orbit interaction in dms . in bulk",
    "we find that the spin components parallel and perpendicular to the net mn magnetization have rather different responses to the presence of the spin - orbit ( dresselhaus ) interaction , the latter being much more affected by it . indeed , coherent oscillations  with a frequency reflecting the precession around a combination of the mn magnetization and the dresselhaus field  develop as a consequence of the interplay between the two interactions , which are completely absent when the exchange interaction dominates .",
    "in addition , the decay rate is greatly enhanced for the perpendicular component by the presence of the dresselhaus interaction in the studied regime . regarding quantum wells , we find that the exchange interaction tends to be more dominant over the spin - orbit interaction ( rashba coupling in this case ) , which led us to consider a family of materials with large valence - band - splitting spin - orbit constant and tunable energy gap . for these dms materials we obtained again a strong effect of the spin - orbit interaction , manifesting itself in the occurence of oscillations which are not seen when the exchange interaction acts alone .",
    "remarkably , even though the combination of exchange and spin - orbit interaction leads to clearly visible oscillations , the decay of the spin polarization is practically unaffected by the presence of the rashba interaction .",
    "these signatures should be detectable experimentally in pump - and - probe experiments .",
    "finally , for both bulk and quantum wells we find that in the mean - field approximation treatment of the exchange interaction there is a strong suppression of the spin - orbit - induced dephasing of the spin component parallel to the mn magnetic field .",
    "the studied interplay between the spin - orbit interaction and the exchange coupling could improve spin control and thereby facilitate potential spintronic applications of dms .",
