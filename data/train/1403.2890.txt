    "quantum effects in low dimensional magnets lead to a diversity of novel ground states , thereby attracting much experimental and theoretical attention in order to understand the impact of these effects on the properties of low dimensional systems . among others ,",
    "the integrable one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic s=1/2 heisenberg spin chain is a particularly interesting model system .",
    "it is characterized by a quantum critical ground state lacking any long range order and by a gapless spectrum of elementary s=1/2 excitations ( spinons ) .",
    "although being known since more than 80 years , it is still a very interesting model system from both the theoretical and the experimental point of view .",
    "this was demonstrated by a recent report on highly precise measurements of the spinon excitation spectrum of a 1d s=1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain material by means of inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite the chain cuprates sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3  and srcuo@xmath6  are very good realizations of the 1d antiferromagnetic s=1/2 heisenberg model .",
    "they exhibit static magnetism only at low temperatures , namely at @xmath9k and @xmath10k , respectively.@xcite for srcuo@xmath6 , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements reported the short - ranged nature of the static magnetism below @xmath11 and the gapless spinon excitation spectrum down to the lowest measured energy transfer of 0.5mev.@xcite the @xmath0cu nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spin - lattice relaxation rates @xmath4  of both compounds display the theoretically predicted temperature independent behavior of a s=1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain.@xcite spin - charge separation , which is an essential feature of the 1d hubbard model,@xcite was experimentally observed already 15 years ago for both compounds.@xcite recently , a spin - orbital separation has been reported for sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3  by means of resonant inelastic x - ray spectroscopy ( rixs).@xcite    apart from the experimental evidences for the good one dimensionality of these compounds , up to now only a few investigations focused on the effects of disorder introduced by impurities in these systems .",
    "however , such studies can reveal important information .",
    "for instance , by increasing the purity of the primary chemicals for the crystal growth , a very large spinon heat conductivity could be observed in highly - pure srcuo@xmath6 , indicating ballistic transport , which is a consequence of the integrability of the heisenberg model.@xcite direct magnetic ( ni ) and nonmagnetic ( pd ) impurity doping on the cu sites within the spin chain structure of sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3  led to an expected increase of the curie contribution in the magnetic susceptibility and to the theoretically predicted reduction of @xmath11.@xcite for srcuo@xmath6  it has been shown that the increase of the curie contribution is the same for magnetic ( ni ) and nonmagnetic ( zn , ga ) dopants , suggesting that its origin is the general chain break effect of the impurities , while ni remains in a low spin ( s=0 ) state.@xcite however , the observation of only a slight increase of the curie contribution upon ni doping could also be linked to the appearance of a pseudo spin gap in the spinon excitation spectrum of srcu@xmath12ni@xmath13o@xmath14 , as recently reported by inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite unexpected strong effects have also been observed in sr@xmath5ca@xmath2cuo@xmath6 .",
    "the introduction of nonmagnetic ca dopants on the sr sites outside the zigzag chain structures drastically suppressed the spinon heat transport@xcite and led to an exponential decrease of the @xmath0cu nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath4  below 100k , pointing towards the opening of a spin gap.@xcite density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations suggested that ca induces a weak bond disorder in the spin chains leading to a small alternation @xmath15 of the intrachain exchange coupling @xmath8 along the chains which causes the opening of the spin gap @xmath16.@xcite these calculations also showed that the value of @xmath16 does not depend on the strength and the sign of the interchain coupling @xmath7 , but on the strength of the alternation @xmath15 of the intrachain coupling @xmath8 .    here , we report measurements of the @xmath0cu nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath4  on the single chain compound sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , where we observe a very similar decrease of the @xmath0cu nmr @xmath4 , confirming that the interchain coupling constant @xmath7 is indeed negligible .",
    "additionally , we performed zero - field ( zf ) muon spin rotation ( @xmath17sr ) measurements to search for static magnetism .",
    "down to 1.5k we did not observe any evidence for the onset of a magnetic order in sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the zigzag spin chains of srcuo@xmath6 , the crystal structure of sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3  contains only single chains of cu@xmath18 ( 3@xmath19 , s=1/2 ) ions , running along the crystallographic @xmath20 direction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chains ] ) .",
    "the nearest neighbor ( nn ) intrachain exchange interaction between adjacent cu moments is antiferromagnetic and its coupling constant amounts to @xmath21k , which is of the same order as in the zigzag chain compound srcuo@xmath6.@xcite the only difference between the two compounds is the existence of a weak , ferromagnetic interchain coupling with @xmath22 in srcuo@xmath6@xcite , which , due to the linear arrangement of cu ions , is absent in sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3 .     chain structure of sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3  and double chain structure of srcuo@xmath6  including the main exchange couplings @xmath8 ( intrachain ) and @xmath7 ( interchain ) .",

    "since @xmath0cu  has a nuclear spin @xmath26 , its nmr spectrum consists of three quadrupolar split lines , where the central line is affected by first order magnetic hyperfine and second order quadrupolar interactions , while the two satellites are subjects to first order magnetic hyperfine and first order quadrupolar effects.@xcite @xmath0cu  nmr ( @xmath26 ) spin - lattice relaxation rate measurements were carried out on the central line of the quadrupolar split @xmath0cu  nmr spectrum ( corresponding to the transition @xmath27 ) in a slightly higher magnetic field of @xmath28 t , with @xmath29 being parallel to the crystallographic @xmath30 and @xmath20 axes .",
    "the inversion recovery method was used to measure @xmath4 . the relaxation function for a magnetic relaxation of a @xmath26 nuclear spin system measured at the central transition",

    "@xmath36 starts to decrease , indicating a distribution of @xmath4 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] ) .",
    "zero field ( zf ) @xmath17sr measurements down to 1.5k have been performed at the gps instrument of the @xmath37m3 beamline at paul scherrer institute ( psi ) in villigen ( ch ) . to reduce the background ,",

    "[ fig : t1 ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath4  for sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3  in comparison to the data of the zigzag chain compound sr@xmath5ca@xmath2cuo@xmath6.@xcite at high temperatures , both compounds display an almost constant @xmath4 , as it is theoretically expected for 1d antiferromagnetic s=1/2 heisenberg chains@xcite and has been reported for the undoped parent compounds.@xcite below @xmath40 k , @xmath4  of sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3  decreases exponentially .",
    "this decrease is identical to the one observed in the ca doped zigzag chain compound sr@xmath5ca@xmath2cuo@xmath6  and points towards the opening of a pseudo spin gap of the same order of magnitude ( @xmath41k ) as in sr@xmath5ca@xmath2cuo@xmath6.@xcite     temperature dependent @xmath4  for sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3  measured along the @xmath20 ( black squares ) and @xmath30 ( green dots ) direction , in comparison to @xmath4  of sr@xmath5ca@xmath2cuo@xmath6  measured along @xmath20 ( open red dots , taken from ref .  ) .",
    "note that the @xmath20 direction of srcuo@xmath6  is cristallographically equivalent to @xmath30 of sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chains ] ) .",
    "the inset shows the temperature evolution of the stretching exponent @xmath36 of the relaxation function ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] ) . ]    on the one hand , this result indicates that the double chain structure of srcuo@xmath6  and the associated interchain coupling constant @xmath7 are not necessary prerequisites for the appearance of a gap in the spin excitation spectrum of the spin chains .",
    "this has also been reported by our previous dmrg calculations , which showed that the value of the spin gap does not depend neither on the value nor on the sign of the interchain coupling @xmath7.@xcite on the other hand , these dmrg calculations also showed , that the spin gap is a consequence of a subtle bond disorder induced by the ca doping , and that the value of the spin gap @xmath16 depends sensitive on the value of the alternation @xmath15 of the intrachain coupling @xmath8 . in this regard ,",
    "the perfect agreement between the two data sets pointing towards spin gaps of equal sizes is surprising , since @xmath15 should depend delicately on the structural background ( e.g. elastic constants ) which is supposed to differ between the two systems .",
    "the observation of the very same decrease of @xmath4  upon cooling might thus either be a coincidence or point towards an intrinsic energy scale defined by a collective ordering phenomena in disordered spin chains .",
    "therefore , further studies ( e.g. of different doping levels ) are envisaged .    apart from the very similar decrease of @xmath4 , there are also slight differences between the two data sets of sr@xmath5ca@xmath2cuo@xmath6  and sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 . at first , @xmath4  of sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3starts to increase again below @xmath4215k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] ) .",
    "this upturn could indicate a slowing down of magnetic fluctuations at least in some parts of the chains .",
    "secondly , below @xmath43 80k the relaxation rates become more distributed , indicated by a decrease of the stretching exponent @xmath36 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] and inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] ) .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath0cu  nmr spectra broaden significantly upon lowering the temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "this broadening is much stronger than what has been observed in the pure compound sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3.@xcite there , a subtle structure of shoulders , broadening and splitting evolves at low temperatures and has been assigned to a field induced local staggered magnetization developing at broken chain ends.@xcite while these chain ends might also be present in the investigated sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , the associated subtle structure of the spectra can not be observed .",
    "already at room temperature , the spectrum is broader than the one of sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the impact of disorder induced by the ca doping , wich is especially demonstrative at the satellites .",
    "disorder mainly affects the quadrupolar interaction between the quadrupolar moment of the nuclei and the disordered electrical field gradient .",
    "however , the further nmr line broadening upon lowering the temperature evolves simultaneously for all the resonance lines , suggesting a magnetic origin . in line with the upturn of @xmath4  and the decrease of @xmath36 , this broadening points towards slowly fluctuating magnetic moments .",
    "these results suggest that the spin excitations in the chains of sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3  are not simply a subject to a spin gap , but that there could be regions in the sample which are closer to a magnetic order .",
    "therefore , the spin gap should rather be regarded as a pseudo spin gap , in line with our previous dmrg calculations@xcite as well as with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements on srcu@xmath12ni@xmath13o@xmath14.@xcite    let us recall , that the parent compound sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3  exhibits a 3d magnetic order below @xmath445k.@xcite on the other hand , srcuo@xmath6  orders only below @xmath45k .",
    "this could suggest that the low temperature upturn of @xmath4  in sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3points towards an onset of magnetic order .",
    "@xmath0cu  nmr spectra of sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3  for @xmath46 measured at different temperatures ( see labels ) .",

    "to search for such a magnetic order at low temperatures , we performed zf @xmath17sr measurements on sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3  down to 1.5k . due to the extreme sensitivity of the muons to small magnetic fields",

    "[ fig : asym ] ) .",
    "additionally , we performed transverse field ( tf ) @xmath17sr measurements in 30 g and could observe the whole initial asymmetry also at the lowest measured temperature 1.5k ( not shown ) .",
    "these results suggest that no magnetic order sets in in sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cuo@xmath3  down to 1.5k in zero external field .",
    "this observation is in line with measurements of the specific heat , which also did not show any evidence of a magnetic order down to 2k.@xcite nonetheless , the upturn of the @xmath0cunmr @xmath4 , together with the decrease of the stretching exponent @xmath36 and the strong nmr line broadening are pointing towards growing magnetic correlations at least in a strong magnetic field at low temperatures .",
    "these results indicate an approach towards a magnetic order at lower temperatures than the experimentally accessed ones , or in high magnetic fields .",
    "the suppression of long range magnetic order by the opening of a gap is , however , a remarkable observation . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "the observation of the spin gap _ per se _ proves that it is solely induced by a local bond disorder causing a small alternation of the intrachain exchange coupling @xmath8 in ca doped srcuo@xmath6  and sr@xmath6cuo@xmath3 , and that it does not depend on the existence of an interchain coupling @xmath7 .",
    "the observation of the very same spin gap value @xmath16 in both compounds is surprising and might indicate an intrinsic energy scale defined by a collective ordering phenomena in disordered spin chain systems , which should be investigated in more detail in the future . at low temperatures ,",
    "we observe an upturn of @xmath4 , accompanied by a growing distribution of @xmath4 , expressed in a decreasing stretching exponent @xmath36 and a simultaneous broadening of all the @xmath0cu  nmr resonance lines .",
    "while we could prove the absence of any kind of static magnetic order by zf @xmath17sr measurements down to 1.5k , these nmr features indicate growing magnetic correlations at low temperatures in a strong magnetic field .",
