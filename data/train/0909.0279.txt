    "this paper has two goals : to study the relationships between the hierarchies of convexity conditions and tame combing conditions on a cayley complex corresponding to a given group , and to significantly expand the understanding of the cayley complex of thompson s group @xmath0 with respect to the standard finite presentation with two generators and two relators .",
    "several notions of almost convexity for groups have been developed in geometric group theory , from the most restrictive property defined by cannon to the weakest notion of minimal almost convexity introduced by kapovich . for a group @xmath3 with finite generating set @xmath4 , almost convexity conditions for different classes of functions measure , in terms of the given function , how close balls in the cayley graph for @xmath5 are to being convex sets ( see section  [ sub : ac ] for the formal definition ) .",
    "results of thiel and elder and hermiller , respectively , show that cannon s almost convexity and minimal almost convexity , respectively , are not quasi - isometry invariants .",
    "mihalik and tschantz introduced the notion of a tame 1-combing of a 2-complex , and in particular of the cayley complex of a group presentation , in the context of studying properties of 3-manifolds .",
    "hermiller and meier refined the definition of tame combing to differentiate between types of tameness functions , analogously to almost convexity conditions . for a group @xmath3 with finite presentation @xmath6 ,",
    "intuitively the radial tameness function measures the relationship , for any loop , between the size of the ball in the cayley complex containing the loop and the size of the ball needed to contain a disk filling in that loop ( see section  [ sub : tc ] for the formal definitions ) .",
    "hermiller and meier showed that the advantage of studying balls in a cayley complex from the viewpoint of tame combings and radial tameness functions is that the classes of tame combable groups are , up to lipschitz equivalence of radial tameness functions ( for example , linear functions or exponential functions ) , invariant under quasi - isometry , and hence under change of presentation . in the same paper",
    "they also showed that groups which are almost convex with respect to several classes of functions are contained in the quasi - isometry invariant class of groups admitting a 1-combing with a linear radial tameness function . in section  [ sub : hier ] , we give a more complete discussion of the hierarchies of almost convexity conditions and tame combing functions , and their interconnections .    in seeking to further understand the correspondence between these two hierarchies",
    ", we use geometric information from the cayley complex to construct tame 1-combings with linear tameness functions for two groups : thompson s group @xmath0 and the solvable baumslag - solitar group @xmath1 for @xmath7 .",
    "cleary and taback showed that thompson s group @xmath0 is not almost convex with respect to the standard generating set , and belk and bux showed that thompson s group @xmath0 is not minimally almost convex with respect to the standard finite generating set .",
    "elder and hermiller showed that the groups @xmath1 for @xmath8 are also not minimally almost convex with respect to their usual generating set ; moreover , miller and shapiro showed shown that the group @xmath1 does not satisfy cannon s almost convexity condition for any generating set . combining these",
    "then provides the first examples of groups which admit a combing with a linear radial tameness function ( with respect to any choice of finite presentation ) , but which are not minimally almost convex on a particular finite generating set .",
    "these also provide the first examples of groups which admit a combing with a linear radial tameness function but which do not satisfy cannon s almost convexity condition with respect to every finite presentation . in the case of thompson s group @xmath0",
    ", our proof also gives significant new insight into the cayley complex of this group .    despite the prevalence of @xmath0 in geometric group theory ,",
    "a detailed understanding of the cayley complex for the standard finite presentation @xmath9,[x_0x_1^{-1},x_0^{-2}x_1x_0 ^ 2 ] \\rangle\\ ] ] has been elusive . in an intricate analysis",
    ", guba showed that thompson s group @xmath0 has a quadratic isoperimetric function , but it is as yet unknown if thompson s group is automatic , nor even if it is asynchronously combable .",
    "the tame 1-combing we construct for @xmath0 utilizes the nested traversal paths defined by cleary and taback in .",
    "we show that these paths yield a set of quasigeodesic normal forms for the group . extending these paths to a tame 1-combing of the cayley 2-complex @xmath10 for the presentation above",
    "then requires a careful , detailed classification of the edges and 2-cells of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular we analyze which edges do not lie on these normal form paths and for each such edge , we characterize which 2-cells of @xmath10 adjacent to that edge have the property that their other boundary edges lie `` closer '' to the identity vertex @xmath11 . our analysis and measure of closeness to the identity use combinatorial properties computed from the group elements labeling the vertices adjacent to that edge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide an overview of the development of the notions of convexity and combings for groups , and the relations between them . in section 3",
    ", we provide a brief introduction to thompson s group @xmath0 , and define the set of normal forms which will be used in the construction of the tame 1-combing .",
    "we also show that this set of normal forms satisfies a quasi - geodesic property . in section 4",
    ", we construct the 1-combing of @xmath0 , and in section 5 we show that this combing satisfies a linear radial tameness function , as stated in theorem  [ thm : flintame ] . in section 6",
    "we show that @xmath12 with @xmath2 has a 1-combing which satisfies a linear radial tameness function , proving theorem  [ thm : bsp ] .",
    "finally , section 7 is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thm : bscoeff1 ] , verifying that although @xmath12 with @xmath13 and the standard presentation admits a 1-combing with a linear radial tameness function , this tameness function must have a multiplicative constant greater than 1 .",
    "for a group @xmath3 with a finite inverse - closed generating set @xmath4 , we let @xmath14 denote the cayley graph of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath4 , and let @xmath15 denote the word metric with respect to this generating set . the pair @xmath5 satisfies the almost convexity condition @xmath16 for a function @xmath17 if there is an @xmath18 such that for every two points @xmath19 in the sphere @xmath20 ( centered at the identity ) with @xmath21 and every natural number @xmath22 , there is a path inside the ball @xmath23 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 of length no more than @xmath26 .",
    "every group satisfies the almost convexity condition @xmath27 for the function @xmath28 , as two points in the ball of radius @xmath29 can always be connected by a path of length @xmath30 which remains inside @xmath23 , simply by going to the identity and returning outward . thus the weakest nontrivial almost convexity condition for a pair @xmath5 is @xmath27 for the function @xmath31 .",
    "kapovich and riley have shown that this minimal almost convexity condition ( mac ) implies finite presentation of the group and the existence of an algorithm for constructing the cayley graph .    at the other end of the spectrum , @xmath5 is almost convex ( ac ) in the sense of cannon if it satisfies @xmath27 for a constant function @xmath32 . between the constant function and @xmath31",
    ", there are a number of other possible functions which give rise to a range of almost convexity conditions .",
    "for example , ponaru studied the property @xmath27 for sublinear functions @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a finitely presented group , with @xmath4 an inverse - closed generating set .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the cayley complex corresponding to this presentation , with 0- and 1-skeletons @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; that is , @xmath36 is the cayley graph with respect to this presentation .    in order to have a notion of a ball centered at the identity @xmath11 in the 2-complex @xmath10 , the notion of distance between the vertices of a cayley graph",
    "is extended to a notion of level on the entire complex .",
    "the following definition is equivalent to that in .",
    "[ def : level ]    1 .   if @xmath37 is a vertex in @xmath38 , the _ level _ @xmath39 is defined to be the word length @xmath40 with respect to the generating set @xmath4 .",
