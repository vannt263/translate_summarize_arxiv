    "over the last years , significant progress has been made in the modelization of strongly correlated materials .",
    "such systems typically contain partially filled @xmath2 or @xmath3 orbitals@xcite , which lie relatively close to the nuclei .",
    "electronic coulomb interactions can then induce substantial corrections to a bloch one - particle picture , ranging from renormalizations of effective parameters in the sense of landau to full localization of the @xmath2- or @xmath3-degrees of freedom in the mott insulator .",
    "one of the difficulties in describing such correlation effects is to separate the usually rather small energy range of the correlated @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals from the larger energy scale of the itinerant degrees of freedom , e.g. the @xmath4-orbitals of ligand atoms , but also of higher or lower lying states of the transition metal , rare earth or actinide atoms themselves .",
    "the former orbitals are mainly responsible for the low - energy physical properties of the compounds , while the latter act as a screening medium , setting in particular the actual value of the coulomb repulsion of the correlated degrees of freedom .    as discussed in ref .",
    ", screening is a dynamic process which leads in general to a frequency dependent @xmath5 . in a realistic approach to strongly correlated materials",
    ", @xmath1 can be determined at the random phase approximation ( rpa ) level@xcite , once the bands and their eigenstates are computed by an ab - initio calculation .",
    "the static value @xmath6 , evaluated in this way@xcite , has been recently used in the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculations of materials@xcite , and the effect of the frequency dependent screening has been either neglected or empirically taken into account by adjusting the effective static @xmath7 .",
    "the dmft approach , combined with the density functional theory ( dft ) , is an extremely powerful tool to treat ab - initio strongly correlated systems , once the low - energy model is determined@xcite .",
    "however , very little is known on the impact of the frequency dependence of the interaction in the low - energy part of the spectrum . the hardest obstacle in order to include the dynamic @xmath1 into the dmft framework has been the lack of a reliable solver for the quantum impurity problem with a frequency dependent hubbard interaction .",
    "the @xmath8 computed so far for various materials@xcite shows some common features .",
    "the unscreened @xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) is up to an order of magnitude larger than the screened one ( @xmath7 ) . the frequency dependence ,",
    "although complicated , can be represented roughly by a single plasmon frequency @xmath10 , whose value is usually much larger than the bandwidth ( antiadiabatic plasmon ) .",
    "if one wants to deal with its precise form , @xmath11 can be resolved in many plasmon contributions , which characterize the screening process .",
    "these features make the problem difficult : the large @xmath9 rules out the application of traditional weak coupling expansion methods , while the presence of many plasmons prevents the direct use of methods developed in the context of the hubbard - holstein hamiltonian @xcite , as many bosonic baths coupled to the fermion degrees of freedom will be necessary to fully resolve @xmath8 .",
    "recently , this problem has been overcome by a continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) solver proposed by werner and millis@xcite , where a multi - plasmon lang - firsov transformation@xcite is treated exactly in the context of a hybridization expansion algorithm for the dmft impurity hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "also the weak coupling ctqmc algorithm@xcite by rubtsov can treat generic retarded interactions , but it is limited to a not - so - large dynamic @xmath1 and not - so - large screening frequencies , and therefore it becomes prohibitively costly for realistic applications of dynamic screening interactions in a multi - orbital context .",
    "another major problem still left ( even if realiable monte carlo data are available ) is the possibility of computing spectral properties , such as high - energy plasmon satellites .",
    "indeed , the presence of screening modes leads usually to a quite complicated spectrum with a series of peaks located at high energies ( at multiples of the plasma frequencies ) .",
    "those features are hard to get by the usual maximum entropy ( me ) methods@xcite , used to invert the noisy qmc data in the imaginary time domain into the spectral properties at real frequencies .",
    "the me methods are quite reliable at low energy , but usually are not capable to deal with high frequency features .    in this paper",
    ", we present a dmft approach based on a bose factor ansatz ( bfa ) for the green s function which is able to handle a generic @xmath8 interaction in a strong coupling antiadiabatic regime , a typical situation in strongly correlated materials , and provides a robust and general way to compute the full spectrum of the frequency dependent ( retarded ) @xmath1 , with an accuracy capable to resolve the high energy satellites .",
    "our method is based on the separation between the energy scales set by the screened value @xmath7 and treated using well established solvers@xcite , and the dynamic part treated with various levels of approximation , the simplest and most insightful one taken from the dynamic atomic limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ results ] and [ srvo3 ] we report our results for a single - band lattice model at half - filling and a three - band model with the dft density of state ( dos ) of 3 , respectively . finally , sec .  [ conclusions ] summarizes our findings .",
    "we discuss here the case of a multi - orbital hubbard - holstein model . in the context of the dmft approach ,",
    "one maps the full lattice problem into a single - site anderson impurity problem coupled to an effective bath .",
    "the bath is determined self - consistently by requiring that the impurity green s function equals the on - site green s function on the lattice.@xcite therefore , computing in the most effective way the green s function of the anderson model ( am ) is of key importance to have a feasible dmft scheme . here",
    ", we have the additional complication that the effect of screening makes the on - site hubbard interaction retarded . in the matsubara imaginary time action formalism",
    "the dynamic anderson model reads :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the inverse temperature , @xmath14 is the screened interaction , @xmath15 is the set of orbital and spin indexes , and @xmath16 are the creation and annihilation operators satisfying the antisymmetric commutation relations .",
    "@xmath17 is the effective hopping term coupled with the bath via the hybridization @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the chemical potential .",
    "let us assume that the dynamic part of @xmath1 is orbital - independent and couples only to the total charge .",
    "@xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we assume that all details of the interaction due to effective spin and hund s couplings are embedded in the instantaneous part of the full @xmath1 . here and thereafter we are going to take the convention that the instantaneous @xmath22 is the static ( fully screened ) limit of @xmath1 with @xmath23 being a _ repulsive _ contribution .",
    "we are mainly interested in evaluating the green s function @xmath24 and its spectral properties for the model in eqs .",

    "[ s_eff ] , but with a static on - site repulsion , namely @xmath27 .",
    "we highlight that the above factorization is defined in the _ time domain _ , a feature which is borrowed from the dynamic atomic solution of the problem whose form is known analytically , as explained in sec .",
    "[ atomic ] . in that limit the green s function assumes exactly the form in eq .",
    "[ eq : ansatz ] , with @xmath28 the instantaneous @xmath7 atomic green s function .",
    "the static model is much easier than the dynamic one , since it contains only the energy scales set by the screened @xmath29 and the kondo resonance with the bath , and it can be solved by means of various techniques@xcite , which are usually very robust and efficient in this case . on the other hand , @xmath30 is a bose factor , which is a functional of @xmath31 , and it is not known a priori .",

    "[ eq : ansatz ] , for the moment let us take into account the single - orbital symmetric case .",

    ", we are going to test it for the dynamic @xmath1 with a single plasmon mode @xmath10 , which is equivalent to the anderson - holstein model with @xmath54 and the electron-``phonon '' coupling given by @xmath55 .",
    "we use the ctqmc algorithm by rubtsov,@xcite which can handle retarded interactions and yield the exact green s function in a weak coupling regime , to benchmark our approximation for the particle - hole symmetric system with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and few values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",

    "the accuracy is particularly impressive in the case @xmath57 , @xmath56 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , where the impact of the dynamic part is reduced by the larger @xmath63 , and a smaller @xmath9 , namely when the the energy scales of the static part set by @xmath7 are well separated form the dynamic contributions in @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , from fig .  [ benchmark ]",
    "it is apparent that the low energy properties of the system are strongly renormalized by the effect of the high energy components of @xmath1 .",
    "this is quite insightful on the importance of the dynamic screening effects in the treatment of more realistic models that we are going to tackle in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "this can be noted also from the spectral properties reported in fig .",
    "[ spectral ] , which correspond to the green s functions @xmath60 plotted in fig .",
    "[ benchmark ] .",
    "a spectral weight transfer from the low frequency spectrum to the high energy satellites is clearly visible in the figure .",
    "since the dala is obtained in the @xmath65 limit , it works well in the intermediate - strong coupling regime , with @xmath7 and the dynamic part large , as we have seen in the cases analyzed in fig .",
    "[ benchmark ] , where @xmath7 was quite close to the critical @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , see ref .  ) for the mott transition of the static hubbard model .",
    "however , it deteriorates as @xmath7 is getting smaller and the hybridization @xmath47 becomes important to set the low - energy properties of the system .",
    "to show this , let us take into account the anderson - holstein model with @xmath56 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 at @xmath57 , for which the dala gives a result very close to the exact one .",
    "now , let us keep @xmath10 and @xmath68 fixed , such that the dala bose factor ( eq .",

    "the resulting green s functions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ weaker ] .",
    "it is apparent that the dala accuracy reduces as @xmath7 decreases , and the resulting bias is more pronounced in the low - energy part of the green s function .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy is larger around @xmath69 in @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ weaker]a ) , which corresponds to a larger difference at small matsubara frequencies in @xmath70 ( fig .",

    "the correct high - energy asymptotics of the dala is a nontrivial property of this approximation , which is borrowed from the atomic limit exactly built - in . in order to further analyze this important feature , we take into account the temperature dependence of the dala in the symmetric anderson model with a dynamic interaction given by @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . in this not - so - correlated case",

    "is correctly given by the dala , which in this case becomes almost indistinguishable from the exact ctqmc result for @xmath78 .",
    "we note that the dala is capable to reproduce the decay of the imaginary part of @xmath71 well beyond the @xmath79 term , as it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ pinning](b ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the relative accuracy of the approximation increases with the temperature , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ pinning](d ) .",
    "indeed , the exact bose factor @xmath46 is getting closer to @xmath80 as the temperature increases .",
    "at low temperatures , it is the @xmath81 value which is poorly reproduced by the dala .",
    "again , this is related to the roughness of the approximation at low - frequency , which does not describe accurately the low - energy excitations around and below the coherent temperature .",
    "indeed , the friedel sum rule is clearly violated , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ pinning](a ) , where the condition @xmath82 valid at half filling is not met by the dala .",
    "therefore , going beyond the dala is needed to capture the low - energy low - temperature features of the spectral function , while its high - energy properties , as the plasmon satellites , can be successfully taken into account at this level of approximation .",
    "a way to improve the dynamic atomic limit in both the intermediate - low energy correlations and low temperature regimes is provided by the lang - firsov approach .",
    "this approximation has been widely used in the literature to tackle electron - phonon models in the antiadiabatic limit , when the electron - phonon coupling is @xmath83 , with @xmath10 the phonon frequency .",
    "the same applies to models where the interaction is retarded by the charge screening plasmons . in the latter case ,",
    "the antiadiabatic regime is met more often , since the plasmon frequences are larger than the phonon ones , usually by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the realistic retarded hubbard @xmath1 also the electron - plasmon coupling is stronger , as @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath7 . in any case , if @xmath86 , the lang - firsov approach describes well the low energy properties of the system .",
    "here , we use the lang - firsov approximation in a new and original way , as a low frequency correction to the dynamic factor of our green s function ansatz .",
    "the factorization in the @xmath87 space implies a convolution in the @xmath88 space , @xmath89 where @xmath90 are the matsubara components of the bose factor . a way to improve upon",
    "the dala is to choose the @xmath91 factor such that the lang - firsov behavior is obtained at low frequency .",
    "this can be done , by introducing an enhanced @xmath91 defined as : @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are parameters determined by the following conditions : @xmath96 , which keeps the correct number of particles provided by @xmath97 ; @xmath98 for @xmath99 ( the first matsubara frequency ) , which gives the correct friedel sum rule fulfilled by the lang - firsov approximation ( and broken by the dala ) ; @xmath95 is the crossover frequency between the lf behavior at low energy and the atomic dala behavior at high frequency , and its optimal value is @xmath100 , with @xmath10 the lowest holstein frequency .",

    "therefore , to get the dala+lf green s function one has to solve two static models ( with regular and renormalized bath ) and mix them together by using our definition in eq .  [ mixing ] .    one should note that the lang - firsov green s function in eq .",
    "[ lf_green_function ] has been written for a single plasmon ( or phonon ) anderson - holstein model , which gives a rough representation of the dynamically screened @xmath64 present in _ ab - initio _ models .",
    "for instance the c - rpa approximation for @xmath64 usually leads to a quite broad spectrum of screening plasmons , which is difficult or impossible to fit accurately by a single frequency model .",
    "however , a generalization of the eq",
    ".  [ lf_green_function ] can be easily done by following the same lines as in the ref .  .",
    "if the lf renormalization factor @xmath103 is replaced by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are real frequencies , all the screening plasmons are treated on the same footing . although the lf approximation is accurate only for large @xmath106 , the eq .",

    "<S> dynamical screening of the coulomb interactions in correlated electron systems results in a low - energy effective problem with a dynamical hubbard interaction @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a green s function ansatz for the anderson impurity problem with retarded interactions , in which the green s function factorizes into a contribution stemming from an effective static - u problem and a bosonic high - energy part introducing collective plasmon excitations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach relies on the scale separation of the low - energy properties , related to the instantaneous static @xmath1 , from the intermediate to high energy features originating from the retarded part of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that for correlated materials where retarded interactions arise from downfolding higher - energy degrees of freedom , the characteristic frequencies are typically in the antiadiabatic regime . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> accurate approximations to the bosonic factor are relatively easy to construct , with the most simple being the boson factor of the dynamical atomic limit problem . </S>",
    "<S> we benchmark the quality of our method against numerically exact continuous time quantum monte carlo results for the anderson - holstein model both , at half- and quarter - filling . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we study the mott transition within the hubbard - holstein model within extended dynamical mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we apply our technique to a realistic three - band hamiltonian for 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our approach reproduces both , the effective mass renormalization and the position of the lower hubbard band by means of a dynamically screened @xmath1 , previously determined _ ab - initio _ within the constrained random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our approach could also be used within schemes beyond dynamical mean field theory , opening a quite general way of describing satellites and plasmon excitations in correlated materials . </S>"
