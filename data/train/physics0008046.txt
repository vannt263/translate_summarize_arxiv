    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique which is based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the treatment of effects of insertion devices on beam dynamics .",
    "our approach in this paper is based on the generalization of variational - wavelet approach from [ 1]-[8 ] , which allows us to consider not only polynomial but rational type of nonlinearities [ 9 ] .",
    "we present solution via full multiresolution expansion in all time scales , which gives us expansion into a slow part and fast oscillating parts .",
    "so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical process . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time scale .",
    "the same is correct for the contribution to power spectral density ( energy spectrum ) : we can take into account contributions from each level / scale of resolution .",
    "starting from formulation of initial dynamical problems ( part 2 ) we construct in part 3 via multiresolution analysis explicit representation for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets .",
    "then in part 4 we consider further extension of our previous results to the case of variable coefficients .",
    "assuming a sinusoidal field variation , we may consider according to [ 10 ] the analytical treatment of the effects of insertion devices on beam dynamics .",
    "one of the major detrimental aspects of the installation of insertion devices is the resulting reduction of dynamic aperture .",
    "introduction of non - linearities leads to enhancement of the amplitude - dependent tune shifts and distortion of phase space .",
    "the nonlinear fields will produce significant effects at large betatron amplitudes such as excitation of n  order resonances .",
    "the components of the insertion device vector potential used for the derivation of equations of motion are as follows : @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the period length of the insertion device , @xmath3 is the radius of the curvature in the field @xmath4 . after a canonical transformation to betatron variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian is averaged over the period of the insertion device and hyperbolic functions are expanded to the fourth order in @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or arbitrary order ) .",
    "then we have the following hamiltonian : @xmath7+\\frac{1}{4k^2\\rho^2}[k_x^2x^2+k_y^2y^2]\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{12k^2\\rho^2}[k_x^4x^4+k_y^4y^4 + 3k_x^2k^2x^2y^2]\\\\   & -&\\frac{\\sin(ks)}{2k\\rho}[p_x(k_x^2x^2+k_y^2y^2)-2k_x^2p_yxy]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have in this case also nonlinear ( polynomial with degree 3 ) dynamical system with variable ( periodic ) coefficients . after averaging the motion over a magnetic period we have the following related equations @xmath8-",
    "\\frac{k^2_xxy^2}{2\\rho^2}\\\\ \\ddot{y}&=&-\\frac{k_y^2}{2k^2\\rho^2}\\big[y+\\frac{2}{3}k^2_yy^3\\big]-              \\frac{k^2_xx^2y}{2\\rho^2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the first main part of our consideration is some variational approach to this problem , which reduces initial problem to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage .",
    "multiresolution expansion is the second main part of our construction . because affine group of translation and dilations is inside the approach , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of increasing closed subspaces @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "the solution is parameterized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems , one is nonlinear and the second are some linear problems , which are obtained by the method of connection coefficients ( cc)[11 ] .",
    "we use compactly supported wavelet basis .",
    "let our wavelet expansion be @xmath11 if @xmath12 for @xmath13 , then @xmath14 has an alternative expansion in terms of dilated scaling functions only @xmath15 .",
    "this is a finite wavelet expansion , it can be written solely in terms of translated scaling functions . to solve our second associated linear problem we need to evaluate derivatives of @xmath14 in terms of @xmath16",
    "let be @xmath17 .",
    "we consider computation of the wavelet - galerkin integrals .",
    "let @xmath18 be d - derivative of function @xmath14 , then we have @xmath19 , and values @xmath20 can be expanded in terms of @xmath16 @xmath21 where @xmath22 are wavelet - galerkin integrals .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 are 2-term connection coefficients . in general we need to find @xmath23 @xmath24 for riccati case we need to evaluate two and three connection coefficients @xmath25 according to cc method [ 11 ] we use the next construction . when @xmath26 in scaling equation is a finite even positive integer the function @xmath16 has compact support contained in @xmath27 $ ] . for a fixed triple @xmath28",
    "only some @xmath29 are nonzero : @xmath30 .",
    "there are @xmath31 such pairs @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be an m - vector , whose components are numbers @xmath34 .",
    "then we have the first reduced algebraical system : @xmath35 satisfy the system of equations",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 by moment equations we have created a system of @xmath38 equations in @xmath39 unknowns .",
    "it has rank @xmath39 and we can obtain unique solution by combination of lu decomposition and qr algorithm .",
    "the second reduced algebraical system gives us the 2-term connection coefficients ( @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 for nonquadratic case we have analogously additional linear problems for objects ( 6 ) .",
    "solving these linear problems we obtain the coefficients of reduced nonlinear algebraical system and after that we obtain the coefficients of wavelet expansion ( 4 ) . as a result we obtained the explicit time solution of our problem in the base of compactly supported wavelets .",
    "on fig.1 we present an example of basis wavelet function which satisfies some boundary conditions . in the following we consider extension of this approach to the case of arbitrary variable coefficients .",
    "in the case when we have the situation when our problems ( 2),(3 ) are described by a system of nonlinear ( rational ) differential equations , we need to consider also the extension of our previous approach which can take into account any type of variable coefficients ( periodic , regular or singular ) .",
    "we can produce such approach if we add in our construction additional refinement equation , which encoded all information about variable coefficients [ 12 ] . according to our variational approach",
    "we need to compute only additional integrals of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 are arbitrary functions of time and trial functions @xmath44 satisfy the refinement equations : @xmath45 if we consider all computations in the class of compactly supported wavelets then only a finite number of coefficients do not vanish . to approximate the non - constant coefficients , we need choose a different refinable function @xmath46 along with some local approximation scheme @xmath47 where @xmath48 are suitable functionals supported in a small neighborhood of @xmath49 and then replace @xmath50 in ( [ eq : var1 ] ) by @xmath51 .",
    "in particular case one can take a characteristic function and can thus approximate non - smooth coefficients locally . to guarantee sufficient accuracy of the resulting approximation to ( [ eq : var1 ] )",
    "it is important to have the flexibility of choosing @xmath46 different from @xmath52 . in the case when d is some domain , we can write @xmath53 where @xmath54 is characteristic function of d. so , if we take @xmath55 , which is again a refinable function , then the problem of computation of ( [ eq : var1 ] ) is reduced to the problem of calculation of integral @xmath56 the key point is that these integrals also satisfy some sort of refinement equation [ 12 ] : @xmath57 this equation can be interpreted as the problem of computing an eigenvector .",
    "thus , we reduced the problem of extension of our method to the case of variable coefficients to the same standard algebraical problem as in the preceding sections .",
    "so , the general scheme is the same one and we have only one more additional linear algebraic problem by which we can parameterize the solutions of corresponding problem in the same way .",
