    "the change of dimensionality of phase space from two to three significantly complicates the description of the dynamics .",
    "descriptions in terms of phase and amplitude , well established for two - variable models , can not be directly generalized .",
    "although several definitions have been proposed for the phase of chaotic oscillations , all of them suffer from some degree of ambiguity ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "similar difficulties arise in the consideration of nonchaotic oscillatory dynamics which is nevertheless more complex than a single loop in phase space ; for example , in the oscillations that appear in the period doubling cascade to chaos or in the mixed - mode oscillations observed in experiments in chemical systems .",

    "while many aspects of the phenomena we describe in this paper are general and apply to systems in which complex periodic or chaotic orbits exit , we consider situations where a chaotic attractor arises by a period - doubling cascade and confine our simulations to the willamowski - rssler ( wr ) model @xcite , @xmath2 only the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 species vary with time ; all others are assumed fixed by flows of reagents .",
    "study of this model allows us to illustrate most features of the structure of a spatially distributed medium supporting spiral waves .",
    "in addition , it is useful to deal with a specific example since certain aspects of the analysis of periodic and chaotic orbits in high - dimensional concentration phase spaces rely on geometrical constructions that pertain to a specific class of attractors .    the rate law that follows from the mechanism ( [ eq_mechanism ] ) is @xmath6 where the rate coefficients @xmath7 include the concentrations of any species held fixed by constraints .",

    "no - flux boundary conditions were used to prevent the formation of defects with opposite topological charge within the medium and to minimize effects arising from the self - interaction of spiral waves .",
    "the implementation of these initial and boundary conditions does not guarantee the formation of a solitary stable spiral wave ; new spiral pairs and other patterns ( e.g. pacemakers ) may appear as a result of instabilities of the spiral arm and lead to spiral turbulence .",

    "both bands reach and pass each other .    for a short period of time near @xmath114 the bands are indistinguishable in phase space and",
    "the oscillation is effectively period-1 .",
    "it is this exchange phenomenon that produces loops that fill the gap between the period-2 bands in the long - time local trajectories ( cf .",

    "[ r - frm ] ) .",
    "an examination of the loop exchanges at different locations in the medium revealed the existence of the following spatio - temporal pattern . at any fixed location",

    "this periodicity takes an even stronger form : the entire oscillation pattern , however complex , returns with period @xmath118 to the same configuration .",
    "this property smoothly disappears as the defect is approached . for two locations @xmath119 and @xmath120 at the same radius @xmath121 from the defect but at different angles ,",
    "the oscillation pattern at one of them , say @xmath122 , can be obtained from the corresponding pattern at @xmath123 through translation in time by @xmath124 , the sign of the translation being defined by @xmath125 . in view of this observation",
    "it is convenient to introduce a coordinate system @xmath126 rotating with angular velocity @xmath127 relative to the laboratory - fixed coordinate system @xmath116 . in this rotating frame",
    "the local dynamics is described by a time - homogeneous pattern , unique for every spatial point @xmath128 , and the locations in the medium where loop exchange occurs correspond to points where the local dynamics always has a period-1-like character .",
    "the set of loop exchange points constitute a curve @xmath103 with spiral symmetry which winds twice around the defect ( see fig .",
    "[ r - om ] ) .",
    "the two convolutions of @xmath103 lie close to circular arcs with radii 19 and 32 .",
    "this result may be compared with the data obtained from an examination of @xmath91 ( cf .",
    "fig  [ r - frm ] ) .",
    "the crossings of the bands of @xmath91 occur at loci lying on @xmath103 .",
    "close to the defect the resolution of the loop exchange event is difficult . at @xmath129",
    "the difference between the period-2 bands is comparable to the band thickness and the determination of @xmath103 for smaller radii becomes impractical .",
    "variation of the system parameters results in a change of the characteristics of @xmath103 ; for example , the radius of the domain @xmath64 does not affect the shape of the @xmath103 but does change the angular velocity with which the coordinate frame @xmath126 in which @xmath103 is immobile rotates relative to the laboratory - fixed frame @xmath116 .",
    "the angular velocity is higher for smaller system sizes : a decrease in @xmath64 from 80 to 60 reduces the period @xmath118 by a factor of 0.42 . a change in the rate constants @xmath7 leads to a deformation of @xmath103 , although the identification of @xmath103 as a set of exchange points remains and it retains the topology of a curve passing from the defect to the boundary . in sec .",
    "[ glob ] we shall show that the existence of @xmath103 is essential for the maintenance of spatial continuity in media composed of @xmath0-periodic oscillators .    simulations on a square array with dimension @xmath130 ( all parameters were the same as for the disk ) show that a rotating frame is not necessary to observe the time - homogeneous local dynamics of @xmath131 . for this system geometry",
    "the @xmath103 curve is fixed in the medium ,    2    a slight wobbling of the defect ( frame origin ) being neglected .",
    "figure  [ circ ] shows a number of long - time @xmath132 local trajectories on a circle with radius @xmath133 surrounding the defect in the square domain .",
    "one sees a significant dependence of the shape of @xmath134 on the angle @xmath71 .",
    "the local trajectories range from a period-1 orbit at the intersection with @xmath103 to the well - established period-4 orbit observed in a certain range of @xmath71 . to highlight the loop exchange phenomenon , a particular time instant @xmath135",
    "is marked on all the trajectories ( see fig .",
    "[ circ ] ) .",
    "compare the two @xmath134 at the locations @xmath136 and @xmath137 chosen symmetrically on either side of the point @xmath138 where the circle intersects @xmath103 .",
    "visual inspection of these orbits shows that their shapes are essentially identical but representative points @xmath139 and @xmath140 appear on different period-2 bands of the corresponding orbits .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the period-2 bands do not just approach but indeed pass each other at @xmath138 , exchanging their positions in phase space .",
    "since it is not necessary to work in a rotating coordinate system in the case of a square domain , one may resolve the fine structure of the local trajectories to a greater degree as can be seen    in fig .",
    "[ s - frm ] ( a , b ) which shows the cumulative first return map @xmath141 and a magnification of a portion of its structure ( compare with fig .",

    "any perturbation of the self - organized pattern of local oscillator synchronization due to irregular motion of the defect , influence of the boundary or the presence of another defect may obliterate subtle fine structure of the local trajectories . in such a circumstance one is able to observe only two gross branches of @xmath91 and their split nature is not resolvable except for very large @xmath50 .",
    "these observations allow one to suppose that the local trajectories may have the same number of fine structure levels everywhere in the medium but the degree to which different levels are resolved in their phase portraits strongly depends on the position in the medium relative to the defect . in view of this hypothesis",
    "the phenomenon of spatial period - doubling should not be understood in the literal sense but rather as an enhanced ability to resolve the fine structure with the increase of separation from the defect .",
    "the stationary rotating spiral wave arises from the complex defect - organized cooperation of local oscillators .",
    "each location in the medium develops some site - specific pattern of oscillation which often differs significantly from that of the corresponding rate law attractor and varies substantially from one space point to another .",
    "there exists a ( possibly rotating ) reference frame @xmath126 , centered on the moving defect , in which local dynamics takes a simple , time - homogeneous form .",
    "each point of the medium in this frame can be assigned a unique oscillatory pattern , different for different spatial points .",
    "this allows one to introduce the notion of a defect - organized field associated with @xmath126 which specifies the pattern of dynamics in every spatial point of the medium .",
    "this field exhibits a complicated architecture lacking of any simple symmetries ( which can be easily seen from the shape of the @xmath103 curve ) .",
    "the slow rotation of this field in disk - shaped arrays restores the circular symmetry of the solution . although the manner in which different types of local dynamics are distributed in the medium is complex , it is not disordered .",
    "due to the continuity of the medium maintained by the diffusion , it obeys certain topological principles studied in the subsequent sections .",
    "in the previous section the phase space shapes of the local trajectories were shown to vary considerably but smoothly from one point in the medium to another . to describe the transformations of these orbits into each other ,",
    "it is useful to introduce a description which captures only topologically significant changes of phase portraits and disregards unimportant details . to understand the topological principles which determine the global organization of the defect - organized field one",
    "also needs a means to compare the time dependence of local trajectories . in this section",
    "we present a scheme that allows one to partition the continuum of all the observed local trajectories into a finite number of discrete classes according to their phase space shape and time dependence .",
    "consider a period-@xmath0 attractor , @xmath143 , consisting of @xmath0 loops in the concentration phase space @xmath144 .",
    "using the cylindrical coordinate system introduced earlier , we may project @xmath143 on the @xmath145 plane preserving its original orientation and 3d character by explicitly indicating whether self - intersections correspond to over or under crossings .",
    "such a projection shows a span of @xmath20 free from crossings where loops are essentially parallel to each other . this span can be used to number loops , say , in the order of their separation from the origin .",

[ p-4tob ] ) and @xmath162 exist for @xmath147 . with a given loop numbering convention",

    "of course , trajectories corresponding to different attractors can not be made to correspond by such time translations , e.g. @xmath143 attractors described by different permutations @xmath156 have different patterns of oscillation , but even if two @xmath143 lie in the same @xmath156 class their actual shapes in @xmath173 may differ significantly .    to compare the local dynamics at different points in the medium one needs to single out the most important characteristic features of the oscillation pattern while discarding unnecessary details .",
    "a coarse - grained symbolic description of trajectories appears to be useful for this purpose .",
    "we assume that the times @xmath174 at which the trajectory crosses a surface of section @xmath23 ( see sec .  2 ) are approximately equally spaced , independent of the choice of @xmath175 .",
