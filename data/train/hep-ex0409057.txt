    "+ the goal of the _ eg3 _ experiment is to measure the production of pentaquark cascade states using a 5.7 gev electron beam incident on a thin deuterium target ( 0.5 cm length ) but without detecting the scattered electron .",
    "this untagged virtual photon beam is necessary to achieve sufficient sensitivity to the expected small cross sections . in this case , missing mass technique can not be used and the method requires the direct reconstruction of the cascades using their decay products .",

    "the experiment is schedule to start to take data in november 2004 .",
    "a key question in non - perturbative qcd is the structure of hadrons .",
    "the existence of baryon states beyond the minimal @xmath32 configuration is one of the open questions of strong interaction physics .",
    "while such states are not prohibited by qcd , no experimental evidence had been found until recently .",
    "the first evidence of a narrow resonance with a quark content ( @xmath33 ) and so with strangeness s=+1 , named @xmath1 , was reported by the leps collaboration .",
    "this observation has been confirmed by another nine experimental groups , with various projectiles and targets .",
    "there are however other experiments where @xmath1 has not been seen .",
    "in addition , all the signals have rather low statistical precision and there are inconsistencies in the measured masses and widths .",
    "thus , at this time the existence of a narrow pentaquark state is not fully confirmed . + the question of whether pentaquarks exist",
    "can only be solved by a second generation high statistics experiments .",
    "the clas collaboration at jafferson lab is currently pursuing this goal .",
    "high statistics searches for exotic baryons on hydrogen and deuterium target and in various final states have been started in march 2004 and will going on till next year .",
    "data for two of these experiments are already in hand and results are expected by the end of the year .",
