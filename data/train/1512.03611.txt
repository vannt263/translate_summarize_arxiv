    "astrophysical experiments aimed to x - ray the inter - stellar ( ism ) or circum - galactic ( cgm ) medium of our own galaxy along the lines of sight to galactic and extragalactic x - ray sources , are not only powerful in diagnosing the physical , chemical and dynamical state of these , likely multi - phase and metal enriched , mediums but also offer the best avenue to benchmark position and strength of the thousands of electronic transitions from the shells k ( n=1 ) , l ( n=2 ) and m ( n=3 ) of abundant metals , from c to fe ( e.g. verner , verner & ferland , 1996 ; garcia et al . , 2005 ; smith et al . ,",
    "2001 ) that fill the soft x - ray band .",
    "the 6.2 - 124   ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) band contains indeed thousands of electronic transitions whose wavelengths and oscillator strengths , however , are accurately known only for a few tens , mostly those from the outermost occupied shells ( e.g. k transitions from h - like and he - like ions of c to fe ; e.g. verner , verner & ferland , 1996 ) .",
    "the so called inner - shell transitions from the same elements ( e.g. k transitions of o ions from oi to ovi ) are much more difficult to predict theoretically and only a handful of laboratory measurements exist ( e.g. savin et al . , 2012 ) . moreover",
    "all these calculations as well as the existing laboratory measurements , suffer large uncertainties both on wavelengths and strengths ( e.g. gatuzz et al . , 2013a , b ) .",
    "knowing the exact position and strength of these many resonant transitions is also vital , for example , to properly disentangle in the x - ray spectra of extragalactic targets , galactic foreground absorption from putative intervening absorption systems and so avoid mis - identifications .",
    "unfortunately , however , these experiments are tough , and mostly limited by the intrinsic weakness of the transitions coupled with the limited effective area and spectral resolution of the current x - ray spectrometers ( the high- and low - energy - transmission gratings onboard _ chandra _ - hetg , canizares , schattenburg & smith , 1986 and letg , brinkman et al . , 1986 - and the reflection grating spectrometer onboard xmm-_newton _ - rgs , hettrick & kahn , 1986 ) , but also by the presence of instrumental features ( particularly in the rgs ) . for unresolved absorption line detectability ,",
    "the spectrometer resolution and effective area play a complementary role , being present in the function that defines the minimum detectable line equivalent width ( ew hereinafter ) as the root square of their ratio : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the statistical significance , in mumber of standard deviations @xmath12 , down to which the threshold is evaluated , @xmath13 is the spectrometer resolution element in wavelength , @xmath14 is the source specific photon flux at @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the spectrometer effective area at @xmath15 and @xmath17 is the exposure time of the observation . in the important o k transition region ( @xmath18  )",
    "the hetg and letg , have first - order effective areas of only 0.5 - 5 @xmath19 and 8 - 15 @xmath20 , respectively , and line spread function ( lsf ) full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 310 - 370 km s@xmath21 and 620 - 740 km s@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the rgs has a larger effective area ( @xmath22 @xmath19 in the 21 - 24   region , where only one of the two rgss is operating ) , but a lower spectral resolution , with a highly non - gaussian lsf with fwhm@xmath23 km s@xmath21 ( e.g. williams et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "therefore very bright background sources or very long integration times ( or both ) are needed to detect these weak absorption lines fron the galaxy ism / cgm",
    ".    only few of such experiments have been therefore successfully performed so far . in 2004 ,",
    "juett and collaborators , analyzed the hetg spectra of seven galactic binaries with s / n per resolution element ( snre , hereinafter ) of about 5 in the continuum in the region of the o k edge , and were able to identify several o k features from neutral ( oi ) and ionized ( oii and oiii ) ism .",
    "in particular they determined a position of @xmath24   for the oi k@xmath25 transition , which implied a shift of about 50 m  compared to previous theoretical estimates by gorczyca & mclaughlin ( 2000 ) and pradhan et al .",
    "they also identified the strong line ubiquitously present at @xmath26   as due , at least partly , to the oii k@xmath25 transition from the mildly ionized ism , contrary to what had been proposed previously by other authors ( paerels et al .",
    "2001 ; schulz et al . 2002 ; takei et al .",
    "2002 ) , who identified this feature as due to iron dioxide . in 2009",
    ", yao and collaborators confirmed the oi k@xmath25 and oii k@xmath25 identifications , at @xmath27   and @xmath28   respectively , in the higher quality spectrum ( snre @xmath29 in the o k region ) of cygnus x-2 .",
    "finally , recently gatuzz and collaborators ( 2013a , b ) studied the neutral and ionized ism in the disk of our galaxy in the high quality ( snre@xmath30 ) hetg spectra of the low mass x - ray binary xte j1817 - 330 , and reported the detection of several k resonant lines from oi , oii and oiii in particular , for the first time they identified the weak k@xmath31 transition from oii in the galaxy ism , at @xmath32   ( gatuzz et al . , 2013b ) .",
    "in a subsequent work ( gatuzz et al . , 2014 ) , the same authors confirmed the presence of a mildly ionized ( oi to oiii ) ism in the galactic disk , along the lines of sight towards a sample of 8 galactic binaries observed with the _ chandra _ gratings .",
    "a similar work was presented by pinto and collaborators ( 2013 ) , who studied the galactic disk ism in both its gasous , molecular and dust components in the rgs spectra of 9 galactic sources .    in this work for the first time we study the cold and mildly ionized ism / cgm of our galaxy by analyizing two distinct samples of galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "in particular we reduce and analyze rgs data from a s / n - limited ( snre@xmath33 at 22.2  ) sample of 20 galactic x - ray binaries and letg / hetg data of the 28 extragalactic sources from the ( non s / n - limited ) parent sample of gupta et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , plus the rgs data of the blazar mkn  501 , and present a systematic study of the cold metal gaseous components of the galaxy s disk and halo .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present our data reduction and analysis and discuss the results of our analysis for our galactic and extragalactcic samples , separetely .",
    "section 3 is instead dedicated to the modeling , discussion and interpretation of our results : we first derive the basic properties of the oii absorbers ( for which we have 2 transitions ) through a detailed curve of growth analysis of their k@xmath25 and k@xmath31 transitions (  31.-3.5 ) , and then dedicate  3.6 - 3.7 to a self - consistent photoionization modelization of the galactic and extragalactic lines of sight absorbers that includes both oi and oii . finally , ",
    "4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we reduced and analyzed archival rgs data from a well - defined ( see  2.1 ) sample of galactic sources and letg / hetg data of a number of extragalactic sources ( the two blazars with the highest snre spectra available and , for comparison , the lower snre parent sample of gupta et al .",
    ", 2012 : see  2.2 ) in the spectral region of the oi k edge ( 21 - 24  ) .",
    "all data were reduced with the latest versions of the xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ data reduction and analysis softwares ( `` science analysis system '' , gabriel et al . , 2004 - sas - v. 13.5.0 , and `` chandra interactive analysis of observation '' , fruscione & siemiginowska , 1999 - ciao - v. 4.6.1 ) and calibrations ( automatically set according to the given observation , for xmm-_newton _ data , and caldb v. 4.6.2 for _ chandra _ ) .",
    "we followed the appropriate xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ data reduction / analysis threads and documentation to extract hetg / letg and rgs spectra and responses for all observations and , when multiple observations existed for a single source , we co - added their spectra to maximize the snre .",
    "our `` galactic '' sample is extracted from a total of 856 rgs observations of 131 low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries in our own galaxy . after extracting the rgs spectra of all 131 sources from these 856 observations",
    ", we selected only the galactic targets with snre@xmath33 at 22.2   in their co - added rgs spectrum .",
    "this reduced the initial sample of 131 sources to 20 objects .",
    "table 1 lists the 20 targets ( ordered by increasing 3@xmath12 equivalent width detectability threshold - i.e. decreasing sensitivity - for unresolved absorption lines : ew@xmath34snre ) , together with : ( a ) their galactic line - of - sight column density of neutral h as inferred from 21-cm measurements ( kalberla et al .",

    "table 4 summarizes the results of our search for neutral ( oi ) and low - ionization ( oii ) bound - bound absorption , for the 29 sources ( 31 spectra ) of our extragalactic sample .",
    "targets are ordered by decreasing unresolved absorption line sensitivity of their spectra at 22.2  .",
    "wavelength accuracies in table 4 correspond to half the width of the spectrometer resolution element ( 30 m  for the letg and the rgs and 10 m  for the hetg ) . for our two reference extragalactic targets , mkn  421 and pks  2155 - 304 , for which 2 letg spectra are available , the measured ews of the oi and oii lines are always consistent with each other in the two spectra , within their 90% errors .",
    "for these two lines of sight , in table 4 we therefore report the averages of the ews measured in each of the two spectra , together with their associated propagated ( in quadrature ) 1@xmath12 uncertainties .",
    "also in our extragalactic sample , we found ubiquitous evidence for the presence of relatively strong ( ew@xmath41 m ) oi k@xmath25 absorption , with statistical significances in the range 1.1 - 21@xmath12 .",
    "the mean wavelength of the oi k@xmath25 line in our extragalactic sample , is @xmath42 .",
    "the oi k@xmath25 line is not hinted at in only 3 out of the 31 spectra of our sample , that of mr  2251 - 178 ( heavily contaminated by at least two intrinsic warm absorber components ) and those of pg  0844 + 349 , and ngc  3227 ( among those with the lowest snre in our extragalactic sample : table 2 ) .",
    "for these three lines of sight we measure 3@xmath12 upper limits of ew(oi k@xmath25)@xmath43 , 93 and 133 m , respectively .",
    "moderately strong ( ew@xmath44 m ) oii k@xmath25 absorption is also seen in the vast majority ( 27 out of 31 ) of the spectra of our extragalactic sample , at a mean wavelength @xmath45   and with statistical significances in the range 1.3 - 15.6@xmath12 .",
    "three out of the 4 cases in which the oii k@xmath25 line is not hinted at in the data ( the lines of sight toward 1es  1927 + 654 , ngc  1275 and ngc  3227 ) , have very low - snre spectra ( table 2 ) and we measure loose 3@xmath12 upper limits of @xmath46 , 117 and 126 m . in the fourth case ,",
    "mkn  501 , the detection of the oii k@xmath25 line is hampered by the presence of an instrumental feature in its rgs spectrum .",
    "finally , 7 out of the 25 extragalactic lines of sight ( 27 spectra ) that show the presence of oii k@xmath25 , also hint at an absorption line at an average wavelength of @xmath47 , with statistical significances in the range 1 - 5.5@xmath12 .",
    "an absorption line at a consistent wavelength ( @xmath48 is also clearly ( 3.5@xmath12 ) seen in the rgs spectrum of the blazar mkn  501 , where the k@xmath25 transition is blocked by an instrumental feature . following gatuzz et al .",

    "this is not the case . from the estimated @xmath362 and @xmath370",
    "we can then estimate the volume densities of the lines of sight to the galactic and extragalactic sources , respectively , by dividing the measured n@xmath183 ( corrected by the @xmath371 ionization fraction , and , for the galactic sightlines , for which two absorbers are modeled , weighted by the hi ionization fractions of the two components ) by @xmath362 ( disk wimm ) and @xmath370 ( halo wimm ) .",
    "these density estimates are also reported in table 9 for our three galactic and three extragalactic lines of sight , and their averages are @xmath372 @xmath2 and @xmath373 @xmath2 . we then conclude that the wimm absorbing the extragalactic lines of sight is a tenuous and less metal - polluted extension , to large distances above and below the galaxy s disk , and likely to the whole galaxy s halo , of the wimm confined in the disk and absorbing the galactic lines of sight .    by multiplying the average disk and halo wimm densities by the disk and halo volumes ( i.e. assuming homogenity and isotropy ) , within our simplified geometry",

    "the remaining @xmath377 of the oi absorption seen against the galactic lines of sight is due to a cold gaseous component ( t@xmath378 k : hereinafter cold neutral metal mediun , or cnmm ) , confined in the disk of the galaxy and characterized by a relatively high metallicity ( @xmath379 ( consistent with the average metallicity of the disk wimm ) and large columns of oi ( @xmath50n@xmath380 @xmath189 ) that , however , produce little or no saturation in their k@xmath25 line , because of the large doppler parameters ( @xmath381 km s@xmath21 ) .",
    "these large doppler parameters result from the need to produce large oi k@xmath25 absorption ews ( @xmath377 of this line must be filled in by cnmm absorption ) without strongly saturating this transition , i.e. overpredicting the cnmm oi column .",
    "cnmm oi columns are limited by the condition that we impose on the sum of the two _ galabs _ equivalent h column densities ( to be linked to the _ tbabs _ equivalent h column of neutral h set by the",
    "_ tbabs _ best - fitting n@xmath183 ) and by the strong anti - correlation between oi columns and doppler parameters , which would otherwise lead to a fast divergence of the o metallicity towards unrealistically high super - solar values .",
    "such large @xmath382 values can not be due to intrinsic thermal turbulence within the gas clouds ( which are instead cold and should produce oxygen thermal broadening not larger than @xmath383 km s@xmath21 ) , and are therefore likely casued by large line - of - sight intra - clouds velocity dispersion ( we note that @xmath381 km s@xmath21 is of the order of the galaxy rotational velocities ) .",
    "we thus speculate that the cnmm metal absorption is imprinted by a large number of metal - rich neutral clouds of gas , each of which is intrinsically optically thin to oi k@xmath25 opacity .",
    "the minimum number of such clouds can be estimated by imposing that the optical depth of each cnmm cloud at the center of the oi k@xmath25 transition be @xmath384 . in order to be so",
    ", the maximum line - of - sight column density of a single cloud can be at most n@xmath385 @xmath189 .",
    "this gives a minimum number of clouds @xmath386 @xmath387 , over an average pathlength of @xmath388 kpc .",
    "the maximum diameter of each cnmm cloud is thus @xmath389 \\ls   ( < d_{disk } > / \\mathcal{m } ) \\simeq 25 $ ] pc , where @xmath390 is the effective pathlength covered by the cnmm clouds along the line of sight and @xmath391 is the line of sight filling factor of the clouds .",
    "finally , by dividing the average observed @xmath392 by the average @xmath390 , we can get an estimate of the average cnmm volume density and so derive an estimate of the cnmm mass .",

    "our findings for the galaxy s disk gaseous components are consistent with those of pinto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , who studied the rgs spectra of 9 low - mass x - ray binaries .",

    "pinto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also report on higher ionization metal absorption , including the oii absorption considered here , and find oii column densities in the disk of our galaxy of the order of those found here .",
    "however , in their work , the authors fit the ionized lines with an ion - by - ion model and therefore do not constrain directly the physical state of the mildly ionized absorber ( our disk wimm ) , nor quantify the fraction of neutral absoprtiopn that also produces absorption by mildly ionized species . as a consequence pinto et al .",
    ", do not provide an estimate for the metallicity of the disk wimm .",
    "yao & wang ( 2006 ) and yao et al .",
    "( 2009 ) measure the o abundance of the cold ( cnmm ) and warm ( wimm ) ism phases along two particular lines of sight , those of 4u  1820 - 303 and cygnus x-2 . for 4  u1820 - 303 ( not in our sample ) the authors neatly separate a cold component ( oi ) from a warm component ( oii - oiii ) ,",
    "not allowing for part of the oi to be shared by cnmm and wimm . for cygnus",
    "x  2 ( in our sample , but among the lowest s / n spectra ) , conversely , the authors define a single warm component that produces all low - ionization ( oi - oiii ) oxygen ( our model a ) .",
    "when converted to our a@xmath398 units , the cnmm and disk - wimm metallicities reported for these two lines of sight , are : @xmath399 and @xmath400 ( when contamination by the oii compound is partly taken into account : yao & wang , 2006 ) and @xmath401 .",
    "these measurements agree with our average metallicity estimates for the cnmm and the disk wimm , within their 1@xmath12 uncertainties .    as for our estimates of the physical and chemical properties of the halo wimm of our galaxy , this is the first time that such estimates are attempted through the study of metal x - ray absorption against extragalactic targets .",
    "similar studies , however , have been performed in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) in the circum - galactic medium of external galaxies ( e.g. lehner et al . ,",
    "these authors find that the metallicity of the mildly ionized medium ( @xmath402 k ) medium surrounding galaxies at z@xmath403 has a bimodal distribution , with peaks at [ x / h]@xmath404 and [ x / h]@xmath405 , and propose that these bimodality is due to a galaxy orientation effect , with respect to the line of sight passing through the absorber : the low metallicity systems are those tracking pristine gas that is accreting onto galaxies along the galaxy disk planes , while the high metallicity absorbers probe gas reprocessed by the galaxies and flowing out of them in the direction perpendicular to their disk planes .",
    "the average value that we find for [ o / h ] in the halo - wimm of our galaxy ( @xmath321 ) , is fully consistent with that of the the high metallicity portion of the bimodal distribution reported by lehner et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for the circum - galactic medium of galaxies at @xmath406 , possibly indicating that this gas has been first chemically reprocessed in the disk of our galaxy , and then ejected out of the disk and into the galaxy s halo by supernova - driven winds and/or past nuclear activity .",
    "we reported on the spectral analysis of two samples of galactic x - ray binaries and agns and the search for low - ionization oi - oii absorption at @xmath407 in these spectra .",
    "for all targets of our two samples we were able to evaluate the presence and strength of the k@xmath25 transition of oi ( not the k@xmath31 because it falls inside the oi k edge trough where the vast majority of our spectra have s / n too low to search for such feature ) and two transitions of oii ( k@xmath25 and k@xmath31 ) .",
    "this allowed us to evaluate saturation and so to remove the degeneracy between ion column density and doppler parameters and to derive the physical , chemical and dynamical properties of the absorbers .",
    "our main findins are :    1 .",
    "three distinct oi - oii bearing gaseous components are found along the galactic and extra - galactic lines of sight , respectively .",
    "we dub these components cold neutral metal medium ( cnmm ) , disk warm ionized metal medium ( disk wimm ) , and halo - wimm .",
    "the halo - wimm is responsible for virtually all the oi - oii absorption seen along the lines of sight to our extragalactic sources , while the disk - wimm is responsible for virtually the whole oii seen along the lines of sight to our galactic sources but contributes to only about 1/3 of the oi absorption in the galaxy s disk .",
    "halo- and disk - wimm are relatively warm ( @xmath50t@xmath408 k ) , but the disk - wimm is denser , more metal polluted and has larger velocity dispersion than the halo - wimm : @xmath372 @xmath2 , @xmath409 @xmath4 and @xmath410 km s@xmath21 versus @xmath411 @xmath2 , @xmath412 @xmath4 and @xmath413 km s@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "we therefore speculate that the halo - wimm is a tenuous and less metal - polluted extension , to large distances above and below the galaxy s disk ( and likely to the whole galaxy s halo ) of the disk - wimm .",
    "the cnmm absorbs all the galactic lines of sight but produces little imprints along the high latitude extragalactic lines of sight , and is therefore confined in the disk of our galaxy .",
    "this medium is cold ( t@xmath378 k ) and neutral ( @xmath414 ) , has a relatively high metallicity of @xmath415 @xmath4 ( consistent with that of the disk wimm at 90% confidence level ) and a large average line - of - sight oi coumn density @xmath50n@xmath416 @xmath189 combined with an average line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath417 km s@xmath21 , of the order of the rotational velocities in the galaxy s disk .",
    "this let us to the conclusion that the cnmm must be patchy and made up of a large number of clouds ( @xmath418 kpc@xmath21 ) , with an average diameter of @xmath419 pc each .",
    "4 .   by appoximating the disk and halo of of our galaxy as a geometrically thin cylinder centered on the galaxy s center , with radius @xmath357 kpc and half - height @xmath420 kpc , and a 15 kpc radius sphere centered in the galaxy s center , respectively",
    ", we were able to estimate the masses of the two components : we get : m@xmath421 and m@xmath422 m@xmath8 ( only 10% of which in the disk , while the remaining 90% in the halo ) .",
