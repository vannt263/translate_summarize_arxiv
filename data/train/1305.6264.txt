    "intermediate - luminosity optical transients ( http://physics.technion.ac.il/~ilot[ilots ] ; another term in use is red novae ) are eruptive stars with peak luminosity between those of novae and supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the typical duration of these eruptions is weeks to years .",
    "the pre - outburst objects of some of the http://physics.technion.ac.il/~ilot[ilots ] , e.g. , ngc  300 ot2008 - 1 ( ngc  300ot ; @xcite ) , are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or extreme - agb stars .",
    "there are single star models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and binary stellar models @xcite for ilot events harboring agb stars .    in the binary model a companion star , mostly a main sequence ( ms ) star , accretes part of the mass ejected by the evolved star .",
    "the gravitational energy released is channelled to radiation , which is behind most of the ilot brightness , and mass ejection from the companion , mostly two opposite jets .",
    "more radiation can result from the interaction of the jets with the circumstellar mass ( csm ) .",
    "\" the jets lead to the formation of a bipolar nebula , such as the homunculus  the bipolar nebula of eta carinae @xcite  that was formed in the nineteenth century great eruption of eta carinae .",
    "the connection between the ilot ngc  300ot and the great eruption of @xmath0 car is discussed in @xcite .",
    "other comparisons of ilots and lbv eruptions can be found in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite further compared the planetary nebulae ( pn ) ngc  6302 and the pre - pne oh231.8 + 4.2 , m1 - 92 and iras  22036 + 5306 with the ilot ngc  300ot , and proposed that the lobes of some ( but not all ) pne and pre - pne were formed in a several month - long ilot event ( or several close sub - events ) .",
    "we note that @xcite already made a connection between the ilot ngc  300ot and pre - pne , and raised the possibility that the progenitor of ngc  300ot was of mass @xmath1 .",
    "recently more pne were suggested to have part of their nebula ejected in an ilot event , e.g. , kjpn  8 @xcite .",
    "the nebular part of a pn that is formed by an ilot event is likely to have the following characteristic properties @xcite .    1 .   a linear velocity - distance relation .",
    "this is a consequence of that ilots last for time periods @xmath2 of weeks to several years that is much shorter than the observed time of hundreds to tens thousands of years later . in some cases it might be hard to tell whether slower mass elements come from an earlier mass loss episode or were part of the ilot event but",
    "have been slowed down .",
    "2 .   bipolar structure . as the ilot is expected to result from a binary interaction @xcite , the pn components ejected during the ilot event(s )",
    "are expected to have a bipolar structure .",
    "@xcite argued that most pne that have been formed by an ilot event , and hence are bipolar , are expected to host a binary system with an orbital separation of @xmath3 , or the ilot event took place just as the system entered the common envelope phase . in the later case",
    "the orbital separation will be @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the 1670 eruption of ck vul ( nova vul 1670 ) that formed a bipolar nebula , was an ilot event that was powered by merger event .",
    "expansion velocities of few@xmath5 .",
    "as we think that most ilots are powered by accretion onto a ms star @xcite that blows jets , the maximum outflow velocity is similar to that of the escape velocity from ms stars .",
    "the fastest moving elements will be dense parcels of gas that were only slightly slowed - down while the average velocity of the ejecta will be several times lower because of the interaction with the slower agb wind .",
    "therefore , the faster parts of the pn component that was ejected by an ilot event are expected to move at velocities of @xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "total kinetic energy of @xmath8  @xmath9 . as a typical kinetic energy of ilot events is in that range , @xcite argued that the kinetic energy of the ejected component in a pn is likely to be in that range ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the gas in the pn that was not expelled during the ilot event ( or several close events ) will not share these properties .",
    "@xcite argued than in some pne and pre - pne there are nebular components whose properties are compatible with those listed above , and hence might hint that these pne and pre - pne were shaped by ilot events .",
    "the nebulae ( with the relevant references for their relevant properties ) that are listed by @xcite are the pn ngc  6302 @xcite , and the pre - pne oh231.8 + 4.2 @xcite , m1 - 92 @xcite , and iras  22036 + 5306 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we conduct three - dimensional ( 3d ) gas - dynamical simulations to examine the outcome of the interaction of jets with spherical mass shell ejected by the agb star very close to the center .",
    "the interaction takes place in an optically thick region , such that the photon - diffusion time is longer than the relevant flow time ( section [ sec : diffusion ] ) . in section [ sec : numerical ] we describe the numerical set - up , and in section [ sec : results ] we present our numerical results .",
    "our summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "when interaction occurs at a large distance from the center the density of the post - shock jets material is sufficiently low that radiative cooling occurs over a longer than the flow time , @xmath10 .",
    "this type of interaction is referred to also as energy conserving .",
    "closer to the center , and when the region is optically thin , the radiative cooling time is short and a substantial fraction of the thermal energy of the post - shock jets material is radiated away .",
    "this is referred to also as momentum conserving interaction .",
    "these two regimes are assumed to occur in most pne , and most numerical simulations of pn jet - shaping deal with one of these two regimes ( e.g. , @xcite ; balick et al .",
    "we note that @xcite simulate interaction of jets with the agb wind very close to the binary system , but the mass loss rates , hence densities , were low and the interaction region was optically thin . in cases where the interaction occurs close to the center and mass loss rates are high , the interaction region can be optically thick .",
    "this type of flow will be studied here .",
    "the flow time can be defined as the acceleration time of the outer shell , or approximately @xmath11 , where the flow speed @xmath12 is taken to be the final shell speed . in cases studied here",
    "the jets are relatively massive , and the average velocity of the shell can be @xmath13few@xmath5 .",
    "we therefore scale the flow time with @xmath14 the jets post shock temperature is @xmath15 the cooling function at that temperature and below is @xcite @xmath16 , such that the cooling time at a constant pressure is @xmath17 where @xmath18 has been used for the jets post - shock density , with the density of the pre - shock gas being @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the jets mass outflow rate in both directions , and @xmath21 is defined such that the two opposite jets cover in total a solid angle of @xmath22 .",
    "the adiabatic case , where @xmath23 , occurs for interaction distance from the center of @xmath24    equation [ eq : tcool1 ] and [ eq : radiabatic ] assume that the radiative cooling occur in an optically thin region .",
    "this is not the case very close to the center and for very high mass loss rates , as the cases we deal with here . for electron scattering opacity of @xmath25",
    "the approximate optical depth in the radial direction is @xmath26 . for an ilot event of mass loss from an agb star",
    "we take the radius to be the ilots duration times the agb wind speed @xmath27 .",
    "the total mass @xmath28 inside this radius is the mass ejected by the agb and that ejected by the companion in jets .",
    "the optical depth along the radial direction is @xmath29 the diffusion time @xcite is @xmath30 where c is the light speed .",
    "the energy decreases according to @xmath31 ( neglecting heating and adiabatic cooling ) . in this type of interaction the mass in the jets",
    "is not negligible relative to the mass ejected by the agb , and the final outflow velocity will be several@xmath5 .",
    "the flow time is @xmath32 , and hence the ratio of diffusion time to flow time @xmath33 is @xmath34 this ratio implies that the gas will not cool as rapidly as it radiates locally , as photons diffusion time is not much shorter than the flow time .",
    "as well , instabilities , such as rayleigh - taylor instabilities , on scales of @xmath35 that are known to exist in energy conserving flows , will develop on time scales much shorter than the flow time , and hence much shorter than the diffusion time scale .",
    "we now turn to simulate such cases .",
    "our simulations are performed by using version 4.0-beta of the flash code @xcite .",
    "the flash code is an adaptive - mesh refinement modular code used for solving hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics problems .",
    "here we use the unsplit ppm ( piecewise - parabolic method ) solver of flash . we neither include gravity nor radiative cooling as the interaction region is optically thick ( section [ sec : diffusion ] ) . instead of calculating radiative cooling and radiative transfer , that are too complicated for the flow geometry , we lower the adiabatic index @xmath36 to mimic cooling by photon diffusion .",
    "if half the energy is lost , it is as if there are three internal degree of freedom ( total of 6 degrees of freedom ) , and we take @xmath37 . for @xmath38 , for example @xmath39 of the energy is lost in radiation .",
    "this can be simulated with @xmath40 ( 15 degrees of freedom ) . based on this consideration",
    "we will simulate several values of the adiabatic index @xmath36 . using lower values of @xmath36 to mimic radiative",
    "cooling is reasonable when kinetic energy is channelled to thermal energy , but not when thermal energy is channelled to kinetic energy . in this study",
    "we focus only on the early stages of the interaction , so this approximation is adequate .",
    "we employ a full 3d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr , 7 levels ; @xmath41 cells in each direction ) using a cartesian grid @xmath42 with outflow boundary conditions at all boundary surfaces .",
    "we define the @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) plane to be the equatorial plane of the pn and simulate the whole space ( the two sides of the equatorial plane ) .",
    "the grid size is @xmath45 in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions , and @xmath48 in the @xmath49 direction .",
    "the number of cells in all directions ( x , y , z ) is the same , and each grid cell has its @xmath49 axis twice as long as its @xmath46 or @xmath47 axis .",
    "at @xmath50 we place a spherical dense shell in the region @xmath51 , and with a density profile of @xmath52 , such that the total mass in the shell is @xmath53 .",
    "the gas in the shell has an initial radial velocity of @xmath54 .",
    "the shell corresponds to a mass loss episode lasting for @xmath55 and with a constant mass loss rate of @xmath56 .",
    "the regions outside and inside the dense shell are filled with a lower density spherically - symmetric slow wind having a uniform radial velocity of @xmath57 . the slow wind density at @xmath50 is taken to be @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "the two opposite jets are lunched from the inner @xmath60 region and within a half opening angle of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) along the @xmath63axis . by",
    "the term ` jets ' we refer also to wide outflows , as we simulate here . more generally , we simulate slow - massive - wide ( smw ) outflows .",
    "the launching episode lasts for @xmath64 .",
    "the jets initial velocity is @xmath65 , and the mass loss rate into the two jets together is @xmath66 .",
    "the slow wind , dense shell , and the ejected jets start with a temperature of @xmath67 .",
    "the initial jets temperature has no influence on the results ( as long it is highly supersonic ) because the jets rapidly cool due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath36 will be varied between different runs . for numerical reasons",
    "a weak slow wind is injected in the sector @xmath68 .",
    "no seed perturbations are introduced in the initial conditions of our simulations .",
    "the limited numerical resolution supplies the seeds of the instabilities .",
    "the initial flow structure is depicted in figure [ fig : scheme0 ] .",
    ", and are active for two months .",
    "a spherical dense shell with an outward velocity of @xmath54 is placed in the region @xmath69 .",
    "the regions not occupied by the dense shell are filled at @xmath50 with a low density wind radially expanding with a velocity of @xmath70 . ]",
    "our calculations do not include the ionizing radiation and the fast wind blown by the central star during the pn phase .",
    "we simply aim at showing the shaping of the nebular gas during the vigourous jet - shell interaction of an ilot event .",
    "as well , we do nt try to reproduce the structure of ngc  6302 as it evolves several nebular segments that were not formed in an ilot event .",
    "we rather limit ourself to produce a very clumpy lobes with a distance - velocity linear relation .",
    "the mass of @xmath71 and velocity range of @xmath72 in the lobes of ngc  6302 serve as guiding properties .",
    "we here present the results of the 3d simulations of the flow structure during an ilot event .",
    "we assume that the agb star ejected a shell within few years and the companion launched two jets for a period of two months . following the flow for a longer time is numerically challenging , and is postponed for a future study .",
    "we first describe the results of a run with adiabatic index of @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : general ] we introduce some features of the flow by presenting the temperature map at @xmath74 .",
    "the temperature scale is given in the bar on the left in units of @xmath75 .",
    "the density maps at three times of the same run are shown in fig.[fig : dens11 ] .",
    "the prominent features seen in fig . [ fig : general ] are as follows .",
    "the freely expanding jets material encounters a shock , termed reverse shock , and is heated to @xmath76 . for lower values of @xmath36",
    "the postshock temperature will be lower .",
    "due to expansion the shocked jets material suffers adiabatic cooling .",
    "a forward shock is running into the dense shell , and later into the slow wind . at the time presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : general ] the forward shock is already running into the slow wind .",
    "the two lobes form a bipolar nebula , with two opposite protrusions along the @xmath63axis , quite similar to those seen in the pn mz-3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also seen is a concentration of dense gas in the equatorial plane and close to the central star ( @xmath77 ) . this gas might be observed later as a ring in the equatorial plane .",
    "instability fingers ( tongues ) are seen in the interface between the shocked jets and shell media .",
    "they appear early on , but become prominent only after @xmath78  months .",
    "the post - shock jets material has a density of @xmath79 , which is about five times as low as the density of the post - shock dense - shell gas .",
    "the post - shock jets material accelerates the denser shocked shell gas , and the flow becomes rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) unstable .",
    "the resulting instability fingers are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : general ] and in later figures .",
    "thin - shell instabilities might also be involved as the structure of the developed instabilities resemble that of the non - linear thin - shell instability simulated by @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rt ] we show the ratio of the rt - growth time @xmath80 , to the present time of the simulation @xmath81 for the run with @xmath73 .",
    "this ratio is shown only in regions that are rt - unstable by the condition @xmath82 , and is calculated as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the typical size of the rt instabilities and @xmath85 is the pressure gradient .",
    "we take @xmath84 to be , somewhat arbitrarily , @xmath86 , the exact value is of no significance for our analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : rt ] emphasizes the regions that are rt - unstable , from which the development of the instability fingers seen in figures [ fig : general ] and [ fig : dens11 ] can be understood .    to close our study of the flow properties for the @xmath73 run , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dvt ] we present the velocity map and magnitude , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdv ] we show the nebular mass distribution @xmath87 as function of velocity @xmath88 ( the magnitude of the velocity vector in each cell ) . from these figures",
    "we learn that most of the slow gas , @xmath89 resides in the equatorial plane and the regions further out . in the lobes most of the mass has velocities in the range @xmath90 .     run . ]",
    "we mimic the cooling via photon diffusion by taking the adiabatic index to be @xmath91 . to explore the role of different cooling to flow time ratio we also study cases with values of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the density maps at @xmath95 for these cases are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_gama ] . as expected , when radiative cooling is efficient the nebula has a lower velocity , and the instabilities are less developed . for @xmath96 instability fingers can still be identified , but barely so for the run with @xmath97 .",
    "these instabilities might be the source for the clumpy structure observed in ngc  6302 and similar pne .",
    "we perform 3d hydrodynamical simulations of a very - short duration jet - shell interaction . such an interaction can take place when for some reason the agb star goes through an unstable phase and eject within a period of months - years a large amount of mass @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "this ejection is most likely to be aided by a close companion . in our scenario",
    "the companion accretes a large fraction of the ejected mass and launches two opposite jets , in one or more episodes @xcite . during the planetary nebula ( pn ) and pre - pn phases a structure of two lobes having a linear distance - velocity relation",
    "will be observed .",
    "in section [ sec : diffusion ] we find that in the jet - shell interaction region the photon - diffusion time is not much shorter , and even longer , than the gas expansion time .",
    "this implies that the radiative cooling process is relatively slow , and the shocked gas can stay hot for the duration of the acceleration time of the shell by the jets .",
    "this regime of optically - thick interaction is not traditionally considered for pn formation .",
    "we make importance of this new regime , and simulated the interaction in a simple manner , where we mimic the slow radiative cooling process by taking the adiabatic index to be @xmath91 .",
    "the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : general ] - [ fig : compare_gama ] .",
    "we simulate interactions with physical parameters such that the dense shell is denser than the post - shock jets gas .",
    "such a flow is expected to be rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "our main finding indeed , is that as the jets interact with the dense shell instabilities develop and a structure containing dense ` fingers ' is formed , as is expected in rayleigh - taylor or thin - shell instabilities .",
    "at much later times a pn with clumpy lobes that have a linear distance - velocity relation will be observed .",
    "this process might account for the formation of bipolar pne with clumpy lobes , such as ngc 6302 .",
    "to better compare model with observations we are planing to extended our study to include late phases of the flow , and to expand the parameters space of the physical variables .",
    "the energy radiated during the months to years duration of such an event will appear as an intermediate - luminosity optical transient ( ilot ; also termed red nova ) event . in our scenario",
    "there are two sources for the radiated energy of the ilot : the accretion onto the companion and the collision of the jets with the shell .",
    "@xcite consider the entrance of a system to a common envelope phase , and argue that most of the energy might come from the recombination energy of the ejected gas . in our scenario ( and in most ilots ) the recombination energy of the ejected envelope is negligible , and the companion might or might not enter the envelope of the agb star .",
