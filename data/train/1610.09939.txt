    "problem solving by task - groups represents a substantial portion of the economy of developed countries nowadays @xcite . among the work relationship issues that emerge in this situation ,",
    "the most important is perhaps that of intra - group communication .",
    "in fact , the question `` what effect do communication patterns have upon the operation of groups ? ''",
    "has prompted a series of experimental studies in the 1950s , which produced somewhat conflicting conclusions @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the case of imposed communication patterns , which happens in the military and industrial organizations , for instance , and in which the researchers determine who can communicate with whom , thus excluding a priori the alternative of self - organization of the group members .",
    "here we address the issue of the influence of a fixed communication pattern on group performance , as measured by the time the group needs to find the solution of a task .",
    "already in the pioneer studies of the 1950s the concept of centrality has emerged as the chief ( but not the sole ) determinant of the differences in performance of the various group organizations @xcite .",
    "centrality or , more precisely , betweenness centrality is a measure of the closeness of a member to all other group members and , hence , is a measure of the availability of the information necessary for solving the task @xcite .",
    "in fact , a typical finding of those studies was that the most central position in a pattern ( e.g. , in a wheel ) , which is closest to all other positions , is most likely to hit the solution first @xcite .    rather than studying small groups of human subjects as in those seminal works , here",
    "we consider agent - based simulations aiming at offering a more complete understanding of the interplay between the centrality of the communication patterns and the complexity of the task .",
    "even though it is debatable that conclusions drawn from such an approach may apply to groups of human workers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , they certainly hold for distributed computational systems that are ubiquitous in today s society @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "we consider a distributed cooperative problem solving model in which agents cooperate by broadcasting messages informing on their partial success towards the completion of the goal and use this information to copy parts of the tentative answer exhibited by the more successful agent in their influence networks @xcite .",
    "since copying is an essential ingredient of social learning ( i.e. , learning through observation ) and is central to the remarkable success of our species @xcite , we expect that our conclusions may be of relevance to the organization of real - world task - groups .",
    "the parameters of the model are the number of agents in the system @xmath0 and the copy propensity @xmath1 $ ] that is the same for all agents .",
    "the relevant network metric to our study is the betweenness centrality , which measures a node s centrality in a communication pattern @xcite . in order to single out its influence on the group performance , we follow @xcite and fix the group size to @xmath2 and the degrees of the nodes to @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in the rest of the paper we will use the terms communication pattern and network interchangeably .",
    "the task posed to the agents is to find the unique global maximum of a fitness landscape , whose state space is much larger than the group size @xmath0 .",
    "the difficulty of the task is gauged by the number and distribution of local maxima in the landscape .",
    "we find that for easy tasks ( i.e. , for landscapes without local maxima ) the network topology has no apparent effect on the group performance , but for difficult tasks the strength of the performance is associated to the variance of the betweenness centrality among the network nodes . the network that maximizes that variance exhibits a hierarchical organization with a central node and a modular structure ( network a in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that such an organization performs better than a more equalitarian pattern in which the betweenness centrality of all nodes is maximized ( network b in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we find that the best performances are achieved by the so - called inefficient networks , which are characterized by long average path lengths that delay the propagation of information through the network .",
    "this is because in rugged landscapes the information on fitness exchanged by the agents is often misleading , hinting to the locations of local maxima , rather than to the position of the global maximum of the fitness landscape .",
    "in addition , a more detailed consideration of the performance of the nodes shows that for easy tasks the chance that a node finds the answer first is positively correlated with its betweenness centrality . for difficult tasks , however , the chance of a node hitting the solution depends on the copy propensity @xmath4 of the agents : for small @xmath4 all agents are roughly equiprobable of finding the solution . near the value of @xmath4 that optimizes the group performance ,",
    "the central agents perform better . for large @xmath4",
    "the more peripheral nodes have a better chance to get the answer first .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : nk ] we offer an outline of the nk model of rugged fitness landscapes @xcite which we use to represent the tasks presented to the agents .",
    "the behavioral rules that guide the agents in their searches for the global maximum of the landscapes are explained in section [ sec : model ] and the four fixed communication patterns the agents use to exchange information on their tentative solutions are introduced in section [ sec : nets ] . in section",
    "[ sec : res ] we present and analyze the results of our simulations , emphasizing the comparative performance between the different patterns .",
    "finally , section [ sec : disc ] is reserved to our concluding remarks .",
    "the task posed to a system of @xmath0 agents @xmath5 is to find the unique global maximum of a fitness landscape generated using the nk model @xcite .",
    "the nk model is the paradigm for problem representation in organizational theory @xcite , since it allows the tuning of the ruggedness of the landscape  and hence of the difficulty of the task  by changing the integer parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "more pointedly , the nk landscape is defined in the space of binary strings of length @xmath6 and so this parameter determines the size of the state space , namely , @xmath8 .",
    "the other parameter @xmath9 is the degree of epistasis that influences the ruggedness of the landscape for fixed @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath10 the ( smooth ) landscape has a single maximum , whereas for @xmath11 , the ( uncorrelated ) landscape has on the average @xmath12 maxima with respect to single bit flips and the nk model reduces to the random energy model @xcite . finding the global maximum of the nk model for @xmath13 is an np - complete problem @xcite , which means that the time required to solve _ all _ realizations of that landscape using any currently known deterministic algorithm increases exponentially fast with the length @xmath6 of the strings @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper by kauffman and levin for details on the procedure to generate a random realization of an nk landscape @xcite .    since our goal is to compare the performances of cooperative problem - solving systems using the four communication patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we must guarantee that they search the same realizations of the fitness landscapes , as distinct landscape realizations may differ greatly in the number of local maxima for @xmath13 .",
    "thus for each set of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 we generate and store 100 landscape realizations , which we use to test the four patterns .",
    "in particular , we fix the string length to @xmath14 and allow the degree of epistasis to take on the values @xmath10 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . table [ table:1 ] shows the mean number of maxima for each sample of 100 landscapes as well as two extreme values , namely , the minimum and the maximum number of maxima in the sample .",
    ".statistics of the number of maxima in the sample of 100 nk - fitness landscapes with @xmath14 used in the computational experiments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table:2 ]",
    "for a given communication pattern and for fixed values of the nk - model parameters we proceed as follows . for each realization of a fitness landscape",
    "we carry out @xmath17 to @xmath18 searches starting from different initial conditions ( initial strings ) and the resulting average computational cost is then averaged again over @xmath19 distinct landscapes .",
    "we recall that the four networks of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are tested on the same landscapes .",
    "the error bars are smaller than the symbol sizes in all figures shown in this section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the dependence of the average computational cost @xmath20 on the copy propensity @xmath4 of the agents for increasing task difficulties as measured by the landscapes ruggedness , @xmath10 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for landscapes with no local maxima ( @xmath10 , upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , the performances of the four topologies are practically indistinguishable in the scale of the figure and the mean computational cost decreases with increasing @xmath4 , i.e. , the best performance is attained by always copying the model string ( @xmath21 ) and allowing only its clones to explore the landscape through the elementary move .",
    "the presence of a moderate number of local maxima ( @xmath22 , middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) impacts the performance only for large values of the copy propensity and the effect is more pronounced for the more efficient networks c and d. the performances of networks a and b are very similar , except in the region of @xmath4 very close to 1 , where network a slightly outperforms network b. the difference between the performances of these two networks becomes evident for difficult problems ( @xmath23 , lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) only , as illustrated in the inset of that panel .",
    "it seems then that the determinant factor for the superior performance of a communication pattern is the variance of the betweenness among the nodes ( see table [ table:2 ] ) .",
    "however , an alternative explanation may be the presence of modules in network a and quasi - modular structures in networks b and c but not in network d , which exhibits the worst performance . in fact , it has been argued that the modular organization , which is characteristic of hierarchical networks , may facilitate the escape from the local maxima @xcite ( see @xcite for experimental evidence on the effect of a hierarchical social network structure on the efficiency of collective action ) .",
    "the group performance correlates negatively with the efficiency , as measure by @xmath24 , of the networks in the case of rugged landscapes .",
    "this happens because the model agents may broadcast misleading information in that case , and so it is advantageous to slow down the information transmission so as to allow the agents more time to explore the solution space away from the neighborhoods of the local maxima .",
    "we find that @xmath20 is quite insensitive to variations on the topology of the network for small values of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath25 one recovers the results of the independent search , @xmath26 ( see @xcite for an analytical estimate of this value ) , regardless of the network topology and of the value of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "as the difficulty of the task increases the optimum copy propensity decreases towards zero and the minimum of @xmath20 becomes shallower .",
    "in particular , for @xmath11 that minimum happens at @xmath25 . finally , we note that since finding the global maxima of nk landscapes with @xmath13 is an np - complete problem @xcite , one should not expect that the imitative search ( or any other search strategy , for that matter ) would find those maxima for a large sample of landscapes much more rapidly than the independent search .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] reveals the superior performance of networks whose nodes exhibit the largest variability of betweenness in long runs , i.e. , when there is no limit to the duration of the search .",
    "now we examine whether this finding holds also in the case where a maximum search time @xmath27 or computational cost @xmath28 is fixed a priori .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the fraction of runs @xmath29 that found the global maximum for a fixed value of @xmath28 in difficult tasks , i.e. , landscapes with @xmath14 and @xmath23 . for easy tasks ( @xmath10 )",
    "we find that , similarly to the situation for long runs , the fixed - cost performances of the four networks are practically indistinguishable ( data not shown ) .",
    "hence , the conclusions for the long runs displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] are valid in the case that the computational cost of the search is fixed a priori as well .     for network a ( @xmath30 ) network b ( @xmath31 ) , network c ( @xmath32 ) and network d ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "this quantity is given by the fraction of runs with computational cost less than @xmath28 for which a particular node with betweenness @xmath43 finds the solution . since for @xmath44 , we can guarantee that all runs have halted , we have @xmath45 in this limit .",

    "[ fig:4 ] . more generally , the chance of a node hitting the solution increases steadily with its betweenness .",
    "this conclusion holds for networks b and c as well and for all values of the copy propensity @xmath4 .",
    "we recall that all nodes of network d are identical regarding their betweenness values , so this network is unfit for this type of analysis .",
    "surprisingly , the situation is reversed for more difficult tasks ( @xmath22 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "although it is still true that the central node is the most likely to find the solution for short runs ( low computational cost ) , it is the least likely for long runs .",
    "in fact , for long runs the lesser the centrality of a node , the greater its chance of hitting the solution .",
    "we note , however , the superior performance of the more central nodes for short runs seems to be a peculiarity of network a since for networks b and c the nodes with the lowest betweenness are the most likely to find the solution regardless of the value of @xmath28 ( data not shown ) .",
    "it is interesting to mention a related finding within the context of the spreading of epidemics in complex networks that in certain circumstances the most efficient spreaders may not be the most central individuals in the network @xcite .",
    "but for rugged landscapes with parameters @xmath14 and @xmath22 .",
    "the logarithmic scale in the x - axis highlights the change of the networks performance hierarchy for long and short runs .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    actually , for rugged landscapes the performance of a particular node is way more complicated than for smooth landscapes , because it depends on the copy propensity @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ) the central nodes perform better but for @xmath4 close to 1 , in the region where the search is hampered by the local maxima , the peripheral nodes perform better , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "we note that the highly non - monotonic behavior of the probability @xmath51 for the central nodes is an artifact of averaging over different landscapes realizations .",
    "in fact , for some landscape realizations we find a monotonous decrease of @xmath51 with increasing @xmath4 and for others we find that this probability increases with @xmath4 so the central nodes end up performing better than the peripheral ones .    since even our simple agent - based model yields plenty of discordant results regarding the performance of individual nodes on difficult tasks , it is no wonder the profusion of conflicting conclusions drawn from the studies with human subjects , as neither the cooperation strategies used by the subjects nor the difficulty of the problems are controlled variables in those experiments .     in network",
    "a gets the answer first for time - unrestricted runs as function of the copy propensity .",
    "the parameters of the rugged landscapes are @xmath14 and @xmath22 .",
    "the symbols convention is the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and the lines are guides to the eye . , scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the claim that restrictions on the communication channels available to a group affects its problem - solving efficiency is hardly controversial .",
    "however , the issue whether there is a communication pattern which gives significantly better performance than others in solving specific or general tasks has produced conflicting findings @xcite .",
    "the main reason seems to be the strong dependence of the group performance on several aspects of the group organization as well as on the complexity of the tasks and on the cooperation strategies used by the subjects .",
    "hence a thorough analysis of the vast parameter space of the group / task composite is necessary to elucidate that issue .",
    "such comprehensive study is feasible only through computational experiments @xcite .",
    "here we attempt to clarify the role of the betweenness centrality on the performance of a group as well as on the performance of its individual members . to achieve that we compare networks with the same number of nodes ( @xmath2 ) , which are identical with respect to their degrees ( @xmath3 for all nodes ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the networks were generated so as to exhibit special properties regarding their local and global betweenness metrics @xcite .",
    "the task posed to the agents is to find the unique global maximum of a nk - fitness landscape with the parameter @xmath14 fixed but with variable @xmath7 .",
    "the difficulty of the task increases with @xmath7 due to the proliferation of local maxima .",
    "the choice @xmath52 ensures that the group size is fixed close to its optimal value for easy tasks @xcite and that the size of the state space @xmath8 is much larger than @xmath0 , which makes the search for the single global maximum a challenging task .",
    "we find that for simple tasks there is no significant difference in the performances of the different network topologies .",
    "however , the performance of the group members , which is measured by the chance they get the answer first , is strongly correlated to the centrality of the node in the network : the more central a node is , the more likely it is to find the solution of the task .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that the unresponsiveness of the easy - task performance to changes on the communication patterns is because the number of nodes as well as the density of links are the same for the four networks of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "variation of these parameters has a large effect on the group performance for easy tasks .",
    "for instance , for those tasks there is an optimal group size that minimizes the cost of the search and the optimal performance is achieved by fully connected networks @xcite , in agreement with the experimental finding that groups with more communication channels perform better for simple tasks @xcite .    for complex tasks , the best performing communication pattern is the pattern that maximizes the variance of the betweenness among the nodes ( network a in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this network also exhibits the node with the largest possible betweenness allowed by the constraints @xmath2 and @xmath3 for all nodes .",
    "the group performance degrades as that variance decreases towards zero , so that the worst performing pattern is that in which all nodes have the same betweenness ( network d in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , among the topologies displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , network d is the topology with the shortest average path length and so it is the most efficient regarding the transmission of information through the network , whereas network a is above network b only in this rank of efficiency ( see table [ table:2 ] ) .",
    "our finding that inefficient networks perform better is justified by noting that speeding up the transmission of information through the network makes sense only if one can guarantee its faithfulness and usefulness , otherwise it may be wiser to slow it down and give more time for the agents to explore different regions of the state space @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that even in the case the fitness values provide faithful information on the location of the global optimum , viz . for landscapes with @xmath10 , the so - called efficient networks do not perform better than the inefficient ones .",
    "in addition , the attempt to maximize the betweenness of all nodes results in the network with the largest average betweenness ( network b in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , which exhibits the second best performance .",
    "thus it seems that the key factor to improve group performance is not the maximization of the number of nodes that have large betweenness but rather the assignment of a large variety of betweenness values to the nodes .",
    "hence , within the perspective of the betweenness centrality metric , diversity is crucial to boost group performance .",
    "regarding the performance of an individual node of the communication network , measured by the probability that it hits the global maximum first , we find a neat positive correlation between the centrality of a node and its performance on easy tasks , regardless of the topology or of the particularities of the agents , such as their copy propensities @xmath4 .",
    "for complex tasks , however , there is no such a general verdict as the performances of the nodes are strongly influenced by the agents dispositions to cooperate and by the specific realizations of the rugged landscapes .",
    "averaging over the landscape realizations yields a complicated dependence on the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , the central nodes perform better when the network performance is optimal , whereas the peripheral nodes win when the network performance is most heavily harmed by the local maximum traps .",
    "this sensitivity on the details of the model and the consequent impossibility of drawing general ( i.e , task and subject independent ) conclusions is reminiscent of the conflicting outcomes that characterize the experimental literature dealing with the effects of the communication patterns in task - oriented groups @xcite .",
    "a word is in order about the interesting online experiments conducted using amazon s mechanical turk , in which human subjects ( players ) select points for oil - drilling on a map @xcite . the good and",
    "the bad oil wells are the maxima and the minima of a rugged landscape and their locations are unknown to the subjects , who , however , are able to see the coordinates of the selected points as well as the earnings of their network neighbors . the goal of each player is to maximize its own earnings by picking the more productive well .",
    "in contrast with our findings , the best performing networks in the web - based experiments are the so - called efficient networks , characterized by short average path lengths , such as networks c and d in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is the distinct performance measure used in those experiments , namely , the average earnings of the group rather than the time to find the optimum oil well . in addition , since the game does nt stop when that optimum is eventually found by a player , truly useful information about the coordinates of the optimum becomes available to the other players , which may then explain the superiority of the topologies with short average path lengths .",
    "finally , we note that the study of distributed cooperative problem - solving systems diverges from the game theoretical literature on cooperation that followed robert axelrod s 1984 seminal book the evolution of cooperation @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the context of cooperative processes , there is no conflict of interests between the agents and the opposite of cooperation is independent work , rather than defection .",
    "in addition , in the game theoretical framework it is usually assumed that mutual cooperation is the most rewarding strategy for the group in the long run , whereas here we argue that too much cooperation , which results from a high value of the copy propensity , may lead to disastrous results , akin to the so - called groupthink phenomenon that happens when everyone in a group starts thinking alike @xcite .",
    "most studies of the influence of communication patterns on the operation of groups have considered externally imposed patterns that dictate the distribution of the communication channels among the group members ( see @xcite for an exception ) , thus precluding the emergence of a self - organized network .",
    "this connectivity - driven network approach is fitting to describe situations where the connections among nodes are persistent features , such as in the internet , but it may not be so suitable to model the more ephemeral work relationships , which may change on a very short time scale .",
    "a promising avenue for further theoretical investigation is to consider dynamic unidirectional links , as in activity driven models of varying networks @xcite , that can be created or destroyed depending on whether a previous copy process resulted in an increase or decrease of the copier fitness .",
    "the topology of the resulting time varying self - organized network may shed light on the issue of the emergence of leadership in a task - force @xcite .",
