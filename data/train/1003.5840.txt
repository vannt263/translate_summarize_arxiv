    "the subtraction of photons from an optical field is of both fundamental and practical interest , because it is linked to the properties of the annihilation operator and plays a leading role in quantum information protocols involving non - gaussian states generation , manipulation and distillation .",
    "in fact , the simplest way to generate a non - gaussian optical state starting from a gaussian one consists in subtracting photons from it .",
    "photon subtraction can be implemented by inserting a beam splitter in the optical path of the original state , detecting the number of photons of the reflected portion and selecting the transmitted portion only if a certain condition on the number of detected photons is satisfied .",
    "the challenging part of this scheme is the use of detectors able to resolve the number of photons . as a matter of fact , if , on one hand , it is nowadays quite easy to detect a single photon ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , on the other hand , the limited availability of photon counters that can resolve higher numbers of photons has led to the quest for indirect ways to obtain such information @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the subtraction of photons allows not only the generation of non - gaussian states , but also the enhancement of the non - locality of bipartite states @xcite , or the generation of highly non - classical states @xcite useful for quantum information purposes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , non - gaussianity is a necessary ingredient for continuous - variable entanglement distillation @xcite and different protocols relying on gaussification of entangled non - gaussian states @xcite or on de - gaussification of entangled gaussian states have been proposed @xcite . in all these approaches an important role",
    "is played by photodetectors able to perform conditional measurements .    in this paper",
    "we report a thorough analysis of a setup based on hybrid photodetectors allowing the discrimination of the number of detected photons up to tens @xcite .",
    "the aim of the paper is twofold : firstly we demonstrate the feasibility of our setup and , secondly , we investigate its reliability by characterizing the generated conditional states .",
    "the input gaussian states we employ to achieve these goals are single - mode thermal fields .",
    "thermal states are diagonal in the photon - number basis , thus , the knowledge of their photon statistics fully characterizes them and their conditional non - gaussian counterparts , which are still diagonal .",
    "thanks to this property , we can give a complete analytical description of the behavior of our setup , including the actual expressions of the conditional states , and we can verify the agreement between the theoretical expectations and the experimental results with very high accuracy and control . this is a fundamental test in view of the application of our setup to the generation of more sophisticated states by conditioning non - classical , multipartite and multimode ones @xcite .    throughout the paper we investigate two possible scenarios .",
    "we refer to the first one as `` conclusive photon subtraction '' ( cps ) : a photon - number resolving detector is used to condition the signal and to _ conclude _ which is the effective number of subtracted photons .",
    "the second one is the `` inconclusive photon subtraction '' ( ips ) : an `` on / off '' geiger - like detector , i.e. , a detector only able to distinguish the presence from the absence of photons is employed , preventing us from inferring the actual number of subtracted photons .",
