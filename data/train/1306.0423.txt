    "correlation functions are , from this point of view , very similar to partition functions : the averaged correlation can be very different from the typical correlation .",
    "it is very clear in one dimensional spin systems @xcite , where correlation functions can be written as product of random numbers , but it is also true for higher dimensional models @xcite .",
    "more generally , for each observable , it is very important to be aware of the possible differences between typical and averaged values , and to have a clear idea of the distribution over samples .    in the field of classical spin - glasses",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , there has been an ongoing debate on the nature of the spin - glass phase between the droplet scaling theory @xcite , which is based on real space renormalization ideas ( explicit real - space renormalization for spin - glasses have been studied in detail within the migdal - kadanoff approximation @xcite ) , and the alternative replica - symmetry - breaking scenario @xcite based on the mean - field fully connected sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite .",
    "the questions under debate include the presence of the number of ground states ( two or many ) @xcite , the properties of the overlap @xcite , the statistics of excitations @xcite , the structure of state space @xcite , the absence or presence of an almeida - thouless line in the presence of an magnetic field @xcite , etc ... in particular , one of the standard observable to discriminate between the droplet and the replica theories has been the _ averaged _ overlap distribution @xmath22 . in the present paper , we show that this _ averaged _ overlap distribution @xmath22 is actually non - typical and is governed by rare disordered samples , whereas the _ typical _ overlap distribution @xmath23 is in full agreement with the droplet scaling theory .",
    "our conclusion is that it does not seem a good idea to use a non - typical observable such as the _ averaged _ overlap distribution @xmath22 to elucidate the physics of spin - glasses , and that future studies should focus on the _ typical _ overlap distribution to obtain clear conclusions .",
    "note that two recent studies have also proposed to study other statistical properties of the overlap distribution @xmath24 than the averaged value , namely the statistics of peaks @xcite or the median over samples of cumulative overlap distribution @xcite .",
    "we hope that the numerical measure of the _ typical _ overlap distribution , which is a much simpler observable , will give even clearer evidence for the droplet scaling theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_overlap ]",

    "we have obtained that near zero temperature    \\(i ) the _ typical _ overlap distribution is exponentially small in the central region of @xmath2 : @xmath224 where @xmath4 is the droplet exponent defined here with respect to the total number @xmath5 of spins ( in order to consider also fully connected models where the notion of length does not exist ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the appropriate rescaled variable to describe sample - to sample fluctuations is @xmath225 which remains an @xmath7 random positive variable .",
    "\\(iii ) the averaged distribution @xmath8 is non - typical , dominated by rare anomalous samples and can be thus very misleading .",
    "we have first derived these results for the spherical mean - field model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the random variable @xmath12 corresponds to the rescaled difference between the two largest eigenvalues of goe random matrices .",
    "we have then presented numerical results for the long - ranged one - dimensional spin - glass with random couplings decaying as @xmath13 for various values of the exponent @xmath14 , and for the sk - mean - field model ( corresponding formally to the @xmath16 limit of the previous model ) . in all cases",
    ", we have obtained that the typical and averaged overlap distributions are completely different , in order of magnitude and in scaling .",
    "we have also found that in each case , the same droplet exponent governs the four properties we have measured :    \\(a ) the change in the ground state energy between different boundary conditions in a given sample    \\(b ) the correction to extensivity of the averaged ground - state energy    \\(c ) the minimal energy of excitations of a fixed extensive size @xmath226    \\(d ) the decay of the typical overlap distribution    our results are thus in full agreement with the droplet scaling theory .",
    "we hope that future studies on spin - glasses will also measure the _ typical _ values of the overlap distribution @xmath227 or of the cumulative overlap distribution @xmath18 instead of the non - typical averaged overlap distribution , in order obtain clearer conclusions on the nature of the spin - glass phase .",
    "in the droplet scaling theory @xcite , the most important notion is the droplet exponent @xmath4 , with the following physical meanings .",
    "the initial meaning of the droplet exponent @xmath228 is the scaling of renormalized couplings @xmath229 on a length scale @xmath230 @xcite @xmath231 where @xmath117 is an @xmath7 random variable of zero mean ( with a probability distribution symmetric in @xmath176 ) .",
    "this definition is directly used in real - space renormalization studies based on the migdal - kadanoff approximation @xcite .",
    "the definition of eq . [ jr ] means that there is no spin - glass phase when @xmath232 , and that there exists a spin - glass phase when @xmath233 , which is then governed by a zero - temperature fixed point .",
    "the above definition can also be interpreted as the energy scale of optimized excitations of linear size @xmath230 around a given point @xcite @xmath234 where @xmath12 is a positive random variable .",
    "so the energy scale is @xmath235 with a probability @xmath7 , but can also be @xmath7 with the small probability @xmath236 , so that these rare events will lead to power - laws in various observables @xcite .    in the present paper , in order to compare with fully - connected model where the notion of length does not exist , we have chosen to define the droplet exponent with respect to the number of spins @xmath5 involved .",
    "so that eq .",
    "[ exci ] becomes @xmath237 ( for short - ranged models in dimension @xmath169 where @xmath238 , the correspondence reads @xmath239 )      the standard procedure to measure the droplet exponent is to compute , in each given sample @xmath147 , the difference between the ground - state energies corresponding to different boundary conditions @xcite , for instance periodic - antiperiodic @xmath240 where @xmath117 is an @xmath7 random variable of zero mean ( with a probability distribution symmetric in @xmath176 ) here the droplet exponent has thus the meaning of a domain - wall exponent , or stiffness exponent .",
    "the link with eq .",
    "[ jr ] is that the energy difference between different boundary conditions somewhat measures the renormalized coupling between the boundaries .",
    "the link with eq .",
    "[ excin ] is that the change of boundary condition will select an optimized system - size excitation given the new constraints .    for the short - ranged model on hypercubic lattices of dimension @xmath169 , the values measured for the stiffness exponent @xmath241 ( see @xcite and references therein ) reads for the exponent @xmath239 defined with respect to the",
    "number @xmath238 of spins @xmath242      the statistics over samples of the ground state energy in spin - glasses has been much studied recently ( see @xcite and references therein ) with the following conclusions    \\(i ) the averaged value over samples of the ground state energy reads @xmath243 the first term @xmath244 is the extensive contribution , whereas the second term @xmath245 represents the leading correction to extensivity .",
    "\\(ii ) the fluctuations around this averaged value are governed by some fluctuation exponent @xmath185 @xmath246 where @xmath117 is an @xmath7 random variable of zero mean @xmath247 by definition .    for spin - glasses in finite dimension @xmath169 , it has been proven that @xmath248 and that the distribution of @xmath117 is simply gaussian @xcite suggesting some central limit theorem coming from the random couplings .",
    "but the shift - exponent of eq .",
    "[ e0av ] is non - trivial and coincides with the droplet exponent @xcite @xmath249 the link with eq [ excin ] is that the boundary conditions always induce some system - size frustration , and thus some system - size excitations .",
    "this contribution of order @xmath250 is distributed , but the corresponding fluctuations are sub - leading with respect to the bigger fluctuations corresponding to @xmath248 .    besides short - ranged models , the fluctuation exponent @xmath185 and the scaling distribution of @xmath117 have been also studied for long - ranged models @xcite , and the fully connected sk model @xcite .",
    "within the replica theory @xcite , the probability distribution of the cumulative overlap distribution @xmath251 has a non - trivial limit in the thermodynamic limit @xmath252 @xcite : the translation for the cumulative overlap distribution over the central region @xmath253 yields that the probability distribution @xmath254 is indexed by the parameter @xmath255 near the origin @xmath256 , there is the power - law divergence @xmath257 whereas near the other boundary @xmath258 , there is an essential singularity @xmath259 where @xmath260 is given in @xcite .",
