    "traditionally such values as @xmath4  fine structure constant and @xmath5  electron to proton mass ratio are considered unchanging over time and space .",
    "but since their exact values can not be calculated within the standard model , it is natural to question their invariability .    for the first time this issue was addressed by dirac in 1937 @xcite ; he pointed out an interesting numerical coincidence ( which is specific to current age of the universe ) between two large dimensionless ratios involving fundamental constants ( @xmath6  hubble constant , @xmath7  speed of light , @xmath8  planck constant , @xmath9  gravitational constant , @xmath10 , etc . ) .",
    "more precisely , dirac noticed that the ratio of electrostatic and gravitational attraction between a proton and an electron is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe in atomic units ( atomic unit of time is @xmath11 s ) .",
    "he suggested that this coincidence should persist and thus some of the involved constants have to change over time .",
    "multiple other theories with slowly varying parameters appeared since then .",
    "they connect the drift of constants with the existence of additional dimensions in space @xcite , or the different local density of matter around the universe ( chameleon theories ) @xcite , or with some global scalar field @xcite .",
    "testing these models can lead to deeper understanding of physics .    on the contrary recent laboratory experiments",
    "@xcite , astronomical observations and geophysical evidence @xcite have placed tight constraints on the possible variation of @xmath12 and @xmath0 ; in fact they tempt us to declare an actual invariability of their numerical values .",
    "current laboratory bounds ( on 1@xmath13 level ) are @xcite : @xmath14 the high redshift astrophysical observations lead to the following limits @xcite ( 1@xmath13 , presuming a linear change in time ) : @xmath15 at the same time there is tentative astrophysical evidence that @xmath12 is changing in space ( `` australian dipole '' ) @xcite .",
    "these constraints obviously put limits on theories beyond the standard model , so that constants should change slowly if not at all .",
    "testing the constancy of constants  such as @xmath12 and @xmath0 is examining the einstein principle of local position invariance : _ `` the outcome of any local non - gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is being carried out . '' _ in order to experimentally prove or refute invariability of constants more experiments are needed . in point of fact",
    "we are testing the laws of physics that we are currently using , the basis of our understanding of the universe .        using spectra from extragalactic sources for studying variation of constants",
    "was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "later it was also shown @xcite that molecular spectra provide a way to determine possible variation of @xmath0 . high sensitivity for @xmath0 variation may exist in molecules which have more than one equivalent potential minimum and which can tunnel between these minima @xcite .",
    "a well - known example of this kind of molecule is ammonia , @xmath16 , a compound fortunately abundant in interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "mixed tunneling - rotational transitions can be even more sensitive to the change of @xmath0 .",
    "but highly sensitive transitions of this type can be seen only in asymmetric isotopologues of ammonia , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "recently a large number of polyatomic molecules has been observed from the ism at the redshift @xmath19 @xcite . that finding stimulated studies of the molecules with mixed tunneling - rotational transitions . up",
    "to now following these molecules have been studied : hydronium ( @xmath20 ) @xcite , hydrogen peroxide ( @xmath21 ) @xcite , methanol ( @xmath22 ) @xcite , methylamine ( @xmath23 ) @xcite , methyl mercaptan ( @xmath24 ) @xcite and acetaldehyde ( @xmath25 ) , acetamide ( @xmath26 ) , methyl formate ( @xmath27 ) , acetic acid ( @xmath28 ) in @xcite .",
    "the strongest restriction for @xmath0 variation on a cosmological timescale has been obtained by the observations of methanol spectra at redshift @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we suggest similar consideration of ethylene glycol @xmath30 .",
    "it has two equivalent minima in the lowest @xmath31 conformation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : molecules ] .",
    "ethylene glycol has been detected in the comet c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) @xcite and in ism to the center of the milky way galaxy @xcite .",
    "also , recent success in detection of complex organic compounds @xcite at high redshift gives us hope to spot ethylene glycol outside of the milky way .",
    "therefore it is important to know which transitions in ethylene glycol are especially sensitive to the change of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we calculate sensitivity coefficients for a large number of transitions , including those which have not been observed yet .",
    "let @xmath32 be a present - day experimentally observed transition frequency and @xmath33 a frequency shifted due to possible time ( and space ) change of @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "this shift @xmath34 is linked to @xmath35 and @xmath36 through sensitivity coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( we do not consider hyperfine transitions , which may depend on additional parameters , such as nuclear @xmath39-factors ) : @xmath40 for tunneling - rotational spectra of molecules built of light elements ( @xmath41 ) the sensitivity coefficient @xmath42 . at the same time",

    "therefore we neglect @xmath12-dependence and link @xmath44 solely with @xmath36 : @xmath45 @xmath46 experimental data for the spectrum of ethylene glycol are taken from @xcite .",

    "there is strong coriolis interaction between large amplitude tunneling mode and overall rotation @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to calculate sensitivity coefficients for the tunneling - rotational transitions . to this end",

    "this dependence can be reliably established only for the relatively simple hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated hamiltonian can provide better accuracy for the transition frequencies , but do not lead to significant improvement of the accuracy for the sensitivity coefficients .",

    "transitions with even lower frequencies are hardly detectable by modern earth based radio telescopes . to the best of our knowledge",
    "such transitions for ethylene glycol were never seen .",
    "thus , we used our effective hamiltonian with optimal parameters from table  [ tab3 ] to search for such low frequency transitions .",
    "we again restricted ourselves to @xmath109 where our model has been tested against the experiment and proved to be quite reliable . within these limits we found 24 low frequency transitions listed in table  [ tab2 ] . some of them are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of the predicted frequencies to be about 0.5 mhz .",
    "we used the same optimal effective hamiltonian to calculated sensitivities @xmath1 for all transitions from tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] as was described in sec .",
    "[ ssecmudep ] . in order to estimate the uncertainty for the obtained @xmath111 factors we made several additional calculations .",

    "( [ fscal4 ] ) are not very solid .",
    "therefore we repeated calculations of the @xmath111 factors with smaller number of fitting parameters .",
    "in particular , we successively turned each of the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath58 to zero and made fits for remaining 13 parameter sets .",
    "after that we calculated sensitivity coefficients @xmath1 for such restricted parameter sets .",
    "note that according to eq .",
    "( [ meth2 ] ) the value of @xmath1 is inversely proportional to the transition frequency @xmath32 . for the low frequency transitions",
    "predicted frequency may be quite sensitive to the values of the parameters and can be significantly different for the best fit and for the restricted fits .",
    "this part of the error is trivial and can be easily eliminated for example by using the experimental frequencies instead of the calculated ones . because of that we excluded this error by using frequencies from the best fit in the denominator , while the frequency shift @xmath44 in the numerator was recalculated for each restricted set of parameters .",
    "after all these calculations being done we estimate the error @xmath114 for each transition by taking maximum deviation from the main calculation with optimal parameters . in most cases maximum",
    "error comes from the uncertainty in the value of @xmath112 .",
    "however , for some important transitions with high sensitivities the largest deviation corresponds to the fit with @xmath92 set to zero .",
    "the optimal value of this parameter is rather large and setting it to zero significantly influences both the frequencies and their @xmath0 dependence .",
    "the error associated with the parameter @xmath92 is particularly large for some of the most interesting low - frequency transitions . on the contrary ,",
    "transitions with sensitivities close to unity are not sensitive to any changes of the parameters discussed above . here",
    "the main error comes from the uncertainty to which we know @xmath0 dependence of the rotational constants . in refs .",
    "@xcite this error was estimated to be about 1% .",
    "this is the minimal error of our calculation for the predominantly rotational transitions with @xmath115 .      during last few years the molecules with mixed tunneling - rotational spectra proved to be very useful for constraining possible @xmath0 variation on the large space - time scale .",
    "current most stringent limit on such variation has been obtained with methanol @xcite .",
    "there is large variability in the abundances of different species in the ism and in observed intensities of different molecular lines . because of that it is useful to study all potentially interesting molecules and transitions . in this paper we considered one of the last unstudied relatively simple molecules with the tunneling mode .",
    "we found several low frequency transitions in the range between 0.8 and 7 ghz with high sensitivity to @xmath0 variation of both signs .",
    "note that it is the difference in sensitivities that is important for the observation of @xmath0-variation .",
    "the maximum difference in sensitivities for these transitions is close to 34 .",
    "this is comparable to the differences earlier found for methanol @xcite . for a higher frequencies",
    "there are several transitions around 7.0 ghz with sensitivities @xmath116 and one transition at 7.6 ghz with sensitivity @xmath117 .",
    "small frequency differences may help to observe these lines simultaneously , minimizing possible systematic errors .",
    "ethylene glycol has been detected in the ism @xcite , which makes it one of the perspective candidates for the search for @xmath0 variation .",
    "observed lines from the cold molecular clouds in the milky way can be very narrow allowing for high precision spectroscopy .",
    "this can be used @xcite to study the possible dependence of the electron - to - proton mass ratio on the local matter density , which is predicted by models with chameleon scalar fields @xcite . at the same time",
