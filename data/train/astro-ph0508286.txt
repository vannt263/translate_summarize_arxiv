    "that energy direct measurements are presently hardly possible due to the low flux , but indirect measurements observing extensive air showers ( eas ) are performed .",
    "astrophysical scenarios like the change of the acceleration mechanisms at the cosmic ray sources ( supernova remnants , pulsars , etc . ) or effects of the transport mechanisms inside the galaxy ( diffusion with escape probabilities ) are conceivable for the origin of the knee as well as particle physics reasons like a new kind of hadronic interaction inside the atmosphere or during the transport through the interstellar medium .",
    "two classes of theories ( diffusion or acceleration based ) predict knee positions occurring at constant rigidity of the particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the hypothesis of new hadronic interaction mechanisms at the knee energy , as for example the production of heavy particles in @xmath3 collisions , implies an atomic mass dependence of the knee positions .",
    "it is obvious that only detailed measurements over the whole energy range of the knee from @xmath4ev to @xmath5ev and analyses of the primary energy spectra for the different incoming particle types can validate or disprove some of these models .",
    "the highest cosmic energies above the so called ankle are believed to be of extragalactic origin .",
    "thus , in the experimentally less explored region between the first ( `` proton '' ) knee and the ankle there are two more peculiarities of the cosmic ray spectrum expected : ( i ) a knee of the heavy component which is expected ( depending on the model ) either at the position of the first knee times z ( the charge ) or times a ( the mass ) of iron .",
    "( ii ) a transition region from galactic to extragalactic origin of cosmic rays , where there is no theoretical reason for a smooth crossover in slope and flux . + despite eas measurements with many experimental setups in the last five decades the origin of the knee is still not clear , as the disentanglement of the threefold problem of estimate of energy and mass plus the understanding of the air - shower development in the earth s atmosphere remains an experimental challenge . for a detailed discussion of the subject see the review in  @xcite .",
    "the multi - detector system kascade - grande ( karlsruhe shower core and array detector and grande array ) approaches this challenge by measuring as much as possible redundant information from each single air - shower event .",
    "the multi - detector arrangement allows to measure the total electron and muon numbers of the shower separately using an array of shielded and unshielded detectors .",
    "additionally muon densities at further three muon energy thresholds and the hadronic core of the shower by an iron sampling calorimeter are measured .",
    "recently , the original kascade experiment  @xcite was extended in area by a factor 10 to the new experiment kascade - grande  @xcite .",
    "kascade - grande allows now a full coverage of the energy range around the knee , including the possible second knee ( see fig .  [ knee ] ) .",
    "+ from kascade  @xcite measurements we do know that at a few times the knee is due to light elements  @xcite , that the knee positions depend on the kind of the incoming particle , and that cosmic rays around the knee arrive our earth isotropically  @xcite .",
    "kascade - grande  @xcite , measuring higher energies , will prove , if existent , the knee corresponding to heavy elements . additionally kascade could show that no current hadronic interaction model which are unavoidably needed for the interpretation of air shower data , describes very well cosmic ray measurements in the energy range of the knee and above  @xcite .",
    "these model uncertainties are due to the lack of accelerator data at these energies and especially for the forward direction of collisions .",
    "multi - detector systems like kascade and kascade - grande offer the possibility of testing and tuning the different hadronic interaction models .    with its capabilities",
    "kascade - grande is also the ideal testbed for the development and calibration of new air - shower detection techniques like the measurement of eas radio emission  @xcite .",

    "there , the knee is visible as kink to a flatter @xmath33-@xmath37 dependence above @xmath38",
    ". the heavier primary contribution on the results based on the sibyll model is due to predictions of a smaller ratio of muon to electron number for all primaries .",

    "these findings are confirmed by detailed investigations of further shower observables measured by kascade  @xcite .",
    "crucial parameters in the modeling of hadronic interaction models which can be responsible for these inconsistencies are the total nucleus - air cross - section and the parts of the inelastic and diffractive cross sections leading to shifts of the position of the shower maximum in the atmosphere and , therefore , to a change of the muon and electron numbers as well as to their correlation on single air shower basis .",

    "this example illustrates the capabilities of kascade - grande and the high quality of the data .",
    "the kascade - grande reconstruction procedure follows iterative steps : shower core position , angle - of - incidence , and total number of charged particles are estimated from grande array data ; the muon densities and with that the reconstruction of the total muon number is provided by the kascade muon detectors . the reconstruction accuracy ( fig .",

    "the statistical uncertainty of the shower sizes are around @xmath44% and @xmath45% for the total numbers of electrons and muons , respectively .",
    "the critical point of the kascade - grande reconstruction is the estimation of the muon number due to the limited sampling of the muon lateral distribution by the kascade muon detectors .",
    "the systematic uncertainty for the muon number depends on the radial range of the data measured by the kascade array and the chosen lateral distribution function .    at the kascade experiment ,",

    "for the same run time , due to its 10 times larger area compared with kascade , the grande array sees a significant number of showers at primary energies higher .",
    "hence , figure  [ april04_data ] illustrates the capability of kascade - grande to perform an unfolding procedure like in kascade . + figure  [ effi ] shows the efficiency characteristics of the kascade - grande array . for internal tests of the detector stations a 4/7 trigger is performed at the hexagons .",
    "the efficiency of the 7/7 trigger is also shown which is only marginal smaller if the additional requirement is imposed that the muon number has to be reconstructed with the information of the muon detectors of the original kascade array . to reduce efficiently the amount of data a software cut will be applied with the requirement of at least 20 grande stations ( ngrs@xmath4619 ) have to be fired .",
    "a hundred percent efficiency is than reached for all primary particle types for energies above @xmath47ev , providing still a large overlap with the kascade energy range .",
