    "the nature of the metal insulator transition as a function of doping is one of the key issues in strongly correlated materials .",
    "@xcite experimental studies of many high-@xmath7 cuprates reveal a rich phase diagram , with conventional fermi - liquid behavior in overdoped metals and an anomalous pseudogap phase in underdoped systems close to the mott insulator .",
    "one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of the non - fermi - liquid phase is the observation of highly non - isotropic behavior in momentum space .",
    "@xcite whereas along the nodal direction @xmath8 well - defined quasiparticles exist , in the vicinity of @xmath2 strong deviations from fermi - liquid behavior occur . in particular , below a critical doping a pseudogap appears which becomes more prominent close to the mott insulator .",
    "this transition from fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid properties has been widely investigated in recent years , and several theoretical models have been proposed .    dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) provides an elegant and successful framework for the description of the correlation induced transition from metallic to mott insulating behavior .",
    "@xcite the local or single - site version of dmft , however , focusses exclusively on dynamical correlations which can give rise to spectral weight transfer between low and high frequencies . to address the momentum dependence of the self - energy ,",
    "it is important to allow for spatial fluctuations , at least on a short - range atomic scale . for this purpose , several approaches based on cluster extensions of dmft @xcite as well as cluster perturbation",
    "theory@xcite have been proposed .",
    "the general consensus that has emerged from many studies in this field is that scattering processes are indeed much stronger close to @xmath9 and @xmath10 than in other regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "thus , fermi - liquid behavior first breaks down in the antinodal direction and a pseudogap in the density of states opens up . in the nodal direction between @xmath11 and @xmath12 fermi - liquid behavior persists and well - defined quasiparticles can be identified .    in the present work we use exact diagonalization@xcite ( ed ) in combination with cellular dmft@xcite ( cdmft ) to investigate the two - dimensional hubbard model on a square lattice for @xmath0 clusters . for computational reasons",
    ", ed has previously been applied to study this model at @xmath13.@xcite here , we employ an extension to finite temperatures by making use of the arnoldi algorithm@xcite which provides a highly efficient evaluation of excited states . moreover , the cluster ed / dmft is formulated in terms of a mixed basis involving cluster sites and bath molecular orbitals which allows a very accurate projection of the lattice green s function onto the @xmath0 cluster.@xcite thus , despite the use of only two bath levels per cluster orbital ( 12 levels in total ) , the spacing between excitation energies is very small , so that finite - size errors are greatly reduced , even at low temperatures . as a result of these refinements , extrapolation from the matsubara axis yields very accurate self - energies and green s functions at low real frequencies .",
    "the same approach has recently been used to evaluate the phase diagram of the partially frustrated hubbard model for triangular lattices.@xcite    the focus of this work is on the transition from fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid behavior for decreasing hole and electron doping .",
    "in particular , we study how this transition varies as a function of coulomb energy , next - nearest neighbor hopping , and temperature .",
    "a systematic study of this variation is needed to explore the phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model and has to our knowledge not been carried out before .",
    "the key quantity which exhibits the change from fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid behavior most clearly is the self - energy component @xmath1 associated with @xmath2 . for hole doping @xmath14  % ,",
    "spatial fluctuations within the cluster give rise to a collective mode in the imaginary part of @xmath4 above @xmath5 , in agreement with early work for @xmath15 by jarrell _",
    "@xcite based on quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations within the dynamical cluster approximation@xcite ( dca ) .",
    "the real part of @xmath4 then exhibits a positive slope , implying removal of spectral weight from electron states close to @xmath5 and the opening of a pseudogap in the density of states . the evolution of this correlation - induced collective mode with decreasing doping leads to a widening of the pseudogap until it merges with the mott gap at half - filling . in this region ,",
    "the density of states acquires a very asymmetric shape . at",
    "large doping the fermi level is located at a peak in the density of states , while for decreasing doping @xmath5 gradually shifts into the pseudogap , giving rise to a marked particle - hole asymmetry in the spectral distributions @xmath16 due to the reduced spectral weight above @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , with decreasing doping the pseudogap appears first along the antinodal direction before it opens across the entire fermi surface .",
    "these results are in excellent correspondence with recent angle - resolved photoemission data for bi@xmath17sr@xmath17cacu@xmath17o@xmath18 by yang _",
    "et al._@xcite    the phase diagram shows that the change from fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid behavior is remarkably stable , @xmath6 , when system parameters , such as coulomb energy , temperature , or second - neighbor hopping , are varied . for electron doping",
    ", the resonance of @xmath4 is located below the fermi energy , as expected for the removal of hole states just below @xmath5 .",
    "the doping which defines the onset of non - fermi - liquid behavior , is systematically smaller than for hole doping .",
    "finally , the mott transition induced by electron doping exhibits hysteresis behavior consistent with a first - order transition . in the case of hole doping , hysteresis behavior could not be identified at the temperatures considered in this work .",
    "thus , within the accuracy of our ed / cdmft approach , this transition is either weakly first - order at very low temperatures or continuous .",

    "both the lattice green s function @xmath41 and self - energy @xmath44 have continuous spectral distributions at real @xmath45 .",
    "only the paramagnetic phase will be considered here .",
    "it is useful to transform the site basis into a molecular orbital basis in which the green s function and self - energy become diagonal .",
    "the orbitals are defined as : + @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we refer to these orbitals as @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , where @xmath52 is doubly degenerate .",
    "the green s function elements in this basis will be denoted as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 an analogous notation is used for the self - energy .",
    "similar diagonal representations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 have been used in several previous works.@xcite    figure  [ dos ] illustrates the uncorrelated density of states components in the molecular orbital basis , where @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and we denote @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the average or local density is @xmath62 .",
    "note that all molecular orbital densities extend across the entire band width .",

    "hole doping shifts the van hove singularity towards @xmath5 , whereas electron doping moves this singularity away from @xmath5 .",
    "a central feature of dmft is that , to avoid double - counting of coulomb interactions in the quantum impurity calculation , the self - energy must be removed from the small cluster in which correlations are treated explicitly .",
    "this removal yields the green s function @xmath68^{-1 } ,              \\label{g0}\\ ] ] which is also diagonal in the molecular orbital basis .    for the purpose of perfoming the ed calculation we now project the diagonal components of @xmath69 onto those of a larger cluster consisting of @xmath70 impurity levels and @xmath71 bath levels .",
    "the total number of levels is @xmath72 .",
    "thus , @xmath73 where @xmath74 denote the molecular orbital levels , @xmath75 the bath levels , and @xmath76 the hybridization matrix elements .",
    "the incorporation of the impurity level @xmath74 ensures a much better fit of @xmath77 than by projecting only onto bath orbitals .    assuming independent baths for the cluster orbitals , each component @xmath77 is fitted using five parameters : one impurity level @xmath74 , two bath levels @xmath75 and two hopping integrals @xmath76 .",
    "for instance , orbital 1 couples to bath levels 5 and 9 , orbital 2 to bath levels 6 and 10 , etc .",
    "for the three independent cluster green s functions , we therefore use a total of 15 fit parameters to represent @xmath78 .",
    "this procedure provides a considerably more flexible projection than within a pure site basis . since for symmetry reasons all sites are equivalent one would have in this case only four parameters ( without including a level at the cluster sites )",
    "thus , the molecular orbital basis allows for 11 additional cross hybridization terms as well as internal cluster couplings ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , it is much more reliable to fit the three independent molecular orbital components @xmath77 than a non - diagonal site matrix @xmath79 with only 4 parameters .",
    "figure  [ g0 ] illustrates the projection of the lattice green s function @xmath78 onto the cluster for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which corresponds to about @xmath82 hole doping .",
    "projections of similar quality are achieved at other coulomb energies and chemical potentials .",
    "the evaluation of the finite temperature interacting cluster green s function could in principle also be carried out in the molecular orbital basis .",
    "the coulomb interaction then becomes a matrix containing many inter - orbital components .",
    "this step can be circumvented by using a mixed basis consisting of cluster sites @xmath83 and bath molecular orbitals @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the diagonal @xmath85 subblock @xmath86 representing the bath levels remains unchanged , but the diagonal @xmath87 cluster molecular orbital submatrix now becomes nondiagonal in the cluster site basis .",

    "<S> the effect of doping in the two - dimensional hubbard model is studied within finite temperature exact diagonalization combined with cluster dynamical mean field theory . by employing a mixed basis involving cluster sites and bath molecular orbitals for the projection of the lattice green s function onto @xmath0 clusters , a considerably more accurate description of the low frequency properties of the self - energy </S>",
    "<S> is achieved than in a pure site picture . the transition from fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid behavior for decreasing hole doping </S>",
    "<S> is studied as a function of coulomb energy , next - nearest neighbor hopping , and temperature . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the self - energy component @xmath1 associated with @xmath2 is shown to exhibit an onset of non - fermi - liquid behavior as the hole doping decreases below a critical value @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of @xmath4 then develops a collective mode above @xmath5 , which exhibits a distinct dispersion with doping . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the real part of @xmath4 has a positive slope above @xmath5 , giving rise to an increasing particle - hole asymmetry as the system approaches the mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with the removal of spectral weight from electron states close to @xmath5 and the opening of a pseudogap which increases with decreasing doping . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram reveals that @xmath6 for various system parameters . for electron doping , the collective mode of @xmath4 and the concomitant pseudogap </S>",
    "<S> are located below the fermi energy which is consistent the removal of spectral weight from hole states just below @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical doping which marks the onset of non - fermi - liquid behavior , is systematically smaller than for hole doping . </S>",
