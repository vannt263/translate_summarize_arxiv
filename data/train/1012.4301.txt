    "unfortunately , in most cases there does not exist a large body of statistics covering star cluster membership , so estimation of the cluster mass and the full number of members is not an easy task . in some cases dynamical mass estimates were applied when spectroscopic data is available ( making use of the virial theorem , see @xcite ) , although this method can be imprecise ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another method measures the total brightness of identified members and extrapolate it using some luminosity function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however it is often the case that only a few of the brightest stars are reliably identified as members @xcite , which provides only a tiny amount of information about the cluster .",
    "it is natural to expect to find more massive stars in massive clusters .",
    "although , assuming @xcite initial mass function ( hereafter imf ) one would expect several stars with masses @xmath0 in our galaxy , which is not the case .",
    "this controversy was discussed by @xcite and he presented a relation between the cluster mass and the mass of it s most massive star ( assuming random sampling from the salpeter imf ) :    @xmath1    elmegreen tried to introduce an exponential cut - off function to explain the absence of heavy stars , while maintaining randomness of sampling from the imf . however this led to a contradiction with the observed mass functions of massive clusters , as salpeter - like power law can be traced up to at least @xmath2 .",
    "he proposed several explanations for this , including dependence of the imf on the initial cluster mass .",
    "kroupa s imf ( @xcite ) has become popular over the past decade as a standard cluster imf .",
    "it is built from several power - law parts : @xmath3 with parameters ( @xcite ) : @xmath4 from equation [ eq : kroupa ] we see that a sharp cut - off at a high - mass end was introduced , although the exact value of @xmath5 is left as a free parameter . using this version of imf",
    ", @xcite reviewed the correlation between the mass of the most massive star in the cluster and the total cluster mass .",
    "they arrived at the following conclusion : that random sampling contradicts observations ( for a description of various samplings see section [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "@xcite discussed correlation between the number of stars in the cluster and its most massive member mass , and found it compatible with random sampling .",
    "however , they only looked at a small range in cluster masses .",
    "these ( and many more ) papers were recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently studied stellar clusters around young high - mass stars .",
    "they used monte - carlo simulations to try to reproduce properties of observed clusters . among other results",
    ", they found that the distributions for the total cluster mass and for the mass of the most massive star were skewed and suggested using the mode of the distribution instead of its mean or median values .",
    "in this paper we try to produce cluster mass ( @xmath6 ) and membership ( @xmath7 ) estimators using masses of three most massive members , and analyse the precision of these estimators .",
    "we concentrate on two questions :    * what data provides the most reliable information on the cluster properties ? * what is the best method to extract cluster properties from that data ?    having these two goals in mind means we will neglect at least three very important factors : stellar binarity , stellar evolution and cluster dynamics .",
    "_ stellar binarity _ can show itself directly by altering the imf ( if the process of binary star formation differs from that of a single star ) or indirectly by unresolved binaries , that alter the luminosity function and our assumptions about the imf .",
    "this problem was studied by @xcite ; _ stellar evolution _ is important for old clusters , as their heavy stars can evolve and turn to stellar remnants or lose a fraction of their initial mass , which is caused by stellar wind .",
    "modelling this process requires a set of assumptions and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "note that @xcite studied young clusters which allowed them to neglect stellar evolution .",
    "_ cluster dynamics _ leads to mass segregation and evaporation of the cluster with time .",
    "although it is believed that the lighter stars are the most probable candidates to be ejected from the cluster , this can also happen to the heavier stars . for more details on this problem see @xcite and @xcite . however , this effect is less important for young clusters .",
    "of course , it is not possible to weigh stars directly , but we can estimate their mass , mostly done by measuring their brightness .",
    "however , this process is a very uncertain one .",
    "the other way to estimate stellar masses is to weigh binary members , if the orbit is known , but this raises problems of influence of the binarity on the imf mentioned above .",
    "but , again , as we are interested in the statistical side of the problem , we will postpone astrophysical difficulties for later research .",
    "if we assume all stars in the cluster to be single , then the ( initial ) mass of each star depends only on the initial mass function . here",
    "we will consider only one imf  from @xcite ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : kroupa ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is still a matter of debate , therefore several values will be considered in this paper ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , with the main focus being put on @xmath10 . although @xmath11 is not a realistic value it is used here to study the dependence of the results on @xmath5 .",
    "we will try to see how @xmath5 influences the mass estimator precision .",
    "the following notation will be used throughout the paper : @xmath12 , @xmath13 for the average and the median value of @xmath14 respectively ( the same for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "another useful value is the position of the peak of the @xmath17 distribution for a given @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( mode of the distribution ) , which we designate as @xmath18 .",
    "kroupa imf ( see equation [ eq : kroupa ] ) has an average stellar mass @xmath19 for @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite , we used three different methods for generating cluster members :    random sampling : :     @xmath7 stars are taken randomly from the imf , with    @xmath7 ranging from 300 to 10000 . constrained sampling : :     @xmath6 is fixed , then stars are taken from    the imf until their total mass surpass    @xmath6 . thus some spread in @xmath7    is expected in this sample . sorted sampling : :     @xmath6 is also fixed , then    @xmath20 stars are taken from the    imf . if @xmath21 smaller than    @xmath6 , then    @xmath22 stars are    added to the cluster , giving a new @xmath23 and    @xmath24 and the procedure is repeated the cluster mass    @xmath24 surpasses @xmath6 .",
    "after this    the stellar masses are sorted .",
    "if    @xmath25 is larger then    @xmath26 then the    heaviest star is removed from the set .    according to @xcite ,",
    "random sampling is the least realistic model , but the easiest to be modeled and described analytically .    for each set of parameters ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 , sampling , @xmath5 ) ,",
    "30000 clusters were simulated , and for each one five values were saved : cluster mass @xmath6 , number of stars in the cluster @xmath7 , and masses of the three most massive stars of the cluster  @xmath27 .",
    "the goal is to build a method to find @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 , when @xmath28 and @xmath16 is known .",
    "it seems natural to find functions @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 ( as well as @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) . from here on they will be called _ mass estimators _ ( me ) : average me , median me and mode me .",
    "the probability for the most massive star to have mass @xmath35 can be written ( @xcite ) as the probability for a given star to have mass in @xmath36 multiplied by the probability that all other stars have masses below @xmath37 and by the number of stars @xmath7 ( because any star can be the most massive one ) : @xmath38^{n-1 } \\nonumber \\\\       & = & n f(m ) \\left [ 1 - \\int_m^{{m_{\\mathrm{max } } } } f(m')dm ' \\right]^{n-1 } \\label{eq : prob1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course , @xmath14 should be smaller then @xmath5 , otherwise @xmath39 .    we can confidently use part of the kroupa imf ( see equation [ eq : kroupa ] ) for @xmath40 , as the most massive stars are usually much heavier than @xmath41 . substituting [ eq : spectrum ] into [ eq : prob1 ] and integrating we get ( for @xmath42 ) : @xmath43^{n-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a normalisation constant .",
    "if @xmath7 is large , then we can use exponent instead of square brackets ( and replace @xmath45 by @xmath7 for the sake of simplicity ) : @xmath46 the maximum of this distribution ( or the mode of distribution ) is located at the point @xmath47    for @xmath48",
    "the maximum is obviously at the point @xmath49 .",
    "this puts an upper limit on the cluster mass that can be estimated with this formula .",
    "this is @xmath50 and thus @xmath51 . by inverting this equation",
    "we can get an estimate for @xmath7 and @xmath6 from @xmath52 : @xmath53    note that @xmath5 is hidden within the constant @xmath44 in these equations , although the dependence is weak .    for the @xmath54th massive star , if @xmath55 we can use the expression :",
    "finding average and median values for the equation [ eq : p_1st ] is not that easy .",
    "building analytical expressions for the other sampling methods is a much more complicated task and is not discussed here .",
    "the random sampling model has as a natural parameter , the number of stars in the cluster , @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath7 ranges from 300 to 10000 , with 30000 clusters being simulated for each value of @xmath7 .    for each value of @xmath7",
    "the distributions of @xmath28 and @xmath16 were calculated .",
    "an example of these distributions is shown in figure [ fig : random_hist ] . from the figure",
    "it can be seen that the theoretical estimates given by equations [ eq : p_1st ] and [ eq : p_nth ] match the data well .",
    "note the long power - law tails of the distributions , especially for @xmath14 .",
    "this tail leads to significant differences between the average and the median values , making the average much higher .",
    "thus , averages are not so well suited to making cluster mass estimators .",
    "( plus signs ) , @xmath15 ( crosses ) and @xmath16 ( stars ) with theoretical estimates from equations [ eq : p_1st ] and [ eq : p_nth ] ( long - dashed , short - dashed and dot - dashed , respectively ) for @xmath57 ]    now the task is to build a method to find @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 , knowing @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we will try to find functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these functions for @xmath6 are shown in figure [ fig : median1 ] .",
    "they can be approximated with functions of the shape : @xmath60 so those functions rise as power laws for small @xmath37 and then saturates as @xmath37 goes to @xmath61 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the parameters of the fits are shown in table [ tbl : fits ] .",
    "the first column refers to one of the functions from equation [ eq : fits ] , and the second , third and fourth columns are for different parameters applied to this function  @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . for @xmath34 eqautions [ eq :",
    "fits ] can be used ( by setting @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for other estimators",
    "@xmath63 is always close to @xmath67 and @xmath64 is close to @xmath68 , although @xmath69 is a bad fit .",
    "the value of @xmath64 decreases from @xmath70 to @xmath71  this is caused by the fact , that the values of @xmath16 are much smaller than @xmath14 and are well separated from @xmath5 , therefore they are less affected by saturation .",
    "thus , @xmath71 is less sensitive to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "it should be also mentioned that @xmath72 and @xmath64 are highly correlated , so values given in the table [ tbl : fits ] might be not the only ones giving good fits .",
    ".parameters of fits ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : fits ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another check for the reliability of the obtained estimators is to try to apply them to the `` wrong '' dataset , for example  using the median estimator from sorted sampling ( see section [ sec : sorted ] ) to estimate masses for the random one ( see section [ sec : random ] ) or to use an estimator from a dataset with @xmath10 to estimate masses for the @xmath73 dataset etc .",
    "an example of this is shown in table [ tbl : wrong_data ] . here",
    "@xmath5 was varied : a dataset with one @xmath5 was used to build an estimator function ( source dataset ) that was then applied to the dataset with another @xmath5 ( target dataset ) .",
    "it should be noted , that @xmath5 in the target dataset can not exceed that of the source dataset , as the function from equation [ eq : fits ] will be undefined .",
    "diagonals in this table ( i.e. , values with equal source and target datasets ) are the same as columns 8 and 10 in table [ tbl : estvalues ] .",
    "as expected , errors increase with increasing difference between the source and target dataset s @xmath5",
    ". however @xmath16 is better in almost all cases , but the median estimator is as sensitive to @xmath5 variations as the average one , showing errors of up to 75% . on the other hand , relative estimate dispersions decrease rapidly with @xmath5 difference , as the probability to have @xmath14 close to @xmath5 , where one can get large errors , becomes smaller .",
    "it is also important that values of @xmath5 that are smaller than @xmath61 are not realistic , and @xmath11 was introduced just to study the effect of a large range of parameter values .",
    "several mass estimators for cluster mass from the first , second and third most massive stars were defined in this paper .",
    "their precision was estimated .",
    "estimators based on the mass of the third massive member @xmath16 gave the best results ( approximately 3 - 5 times better than those based on @xmath14 ) , and are less dependent on the maximum allowed stellar mass @xmath5 and assumed way of star formation ( algorithm for picking masses from the imf ) .",
    "we found that it is also better to build estimators on the median or mode values of @xmath74 instead of the average values .",
    "the reason is that the strong power - law tails in the @xmath74 distributions make the average value a less representative parameter .",
    "however , as several astrophysical effects were not taken into account , these results can not yet be applied to most of the real clusters .",
    "inclusion of evolution into this model is a subject for further work .",
    "here it was shown that @xmath16 is a good candidate for building mass estimators .",
    "error analysis was also carried out and revealed a power - law tail in the error distribution .",
    "we showed that the median ( or mode ) values are much better sources for mass estimators than the average values ."
