    "1 ) . the single crystal data in fig . 9 for nd@xmath3tb@xmath4al@xmath2 also supports the genuineness of the observed phenomenon .",
    "however , statistical fluctuations at the atomic level , which maintain ( 1-@xmath26):@xmath26 ratio of nd@xmath6 and tb@xmath6/gd@xmath6 ions at a larger length scale , can not be fully ruled out as a cause of bimodal distribution in the time scales of magnetic dynamics centred around clusters of nd@xmath6 and gd@xmath6/tb@xmath6 ions in the respective systems .",
    "the intertwinned chains of clusters of two types , the dynamics of one of which slows down near the upper transition ( at @xmath62 ) , followed by complete freezing of the dynamics of all the magnetic ions in the entire sample below the onset of the lower transition ( at @xmath53 ) , could account for the repeated magnetic compensation behavior in nd@xmath49gd@xmath50rh@xmath51b@xmath2 and nd@xmath3tb@xmath4al@xmath2 alloys .",
    "the details of the slow down of magnetic dynamics in the two systems are likely to be different , considering that the freezing in of the spin - disorder resistivity is conspicuous at @xmath27 in nd@xmath3tb@xmath4al@xmath2 , as compared to its conspicuousness at @xmath53 in nd@xmath49gd@xmath50rh@xmath51b@xmath2 .",
    "the important differences in the specific heat responses in the two systems also call for a microscopic explanation .",
    "it is hoped that the new results presented here would spur a simulation study of the admixed rare earth intermetallic systems , where long range rkky interaction ( via the conduction electrons ) mediates the coupling between the 4@xmath9-spins of dissimilar rare earth ions .",
    "the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) studies in admixed nd@xmath24tb@xmath35al@xmath2 and nd@xmath24gd@xmath35rh@xmath51b@xmath2 series could also be useful in tracking the temperature dependences of 4@xmath9-spins and 4@xmath9-orbital contributions of individual rare earth ions in the entire sample .",
    "any gross difference in the inhomogeniety / dynamics would show up in the thermal evolution of the sub - parts of the magnetic moments of the 4@xmath9-rare earth ions .",
    "to summarize , we have presented heighlights of the results of our investigations in admixed rare earth alloys with near - zero net - magnetization in the series nd@xmath24gd@xmath35al@xmath2 and nd@xmath24tb@xmath35al@xmath2 .",
    "the interest in the stoichiometries imbibing near - zero magnetization characteristic had been rekindled in contemporary times , as such samples concurrently possess large spin polarization in the conduction band , which can find niche application potential in spintronics@xcite .",
    "the discovery of repeated magnetic compensation in nd@xmath49gd@xmath50rh@xmath7b@xmath2 had been an unexpected finding@xcite .",
    "this motivated us to search for such a behavior in zero magnetization stoichiometries in different ferromagnetic rare earth series .",
    "our present successful identification of repeated magnetic compensation in nd@xmath3tb@xmath4al@xmath2 , alongwith the earlier results in nd@xmath49gd@xmath50rh@xmath7b@xmath2@xcite emphasize that the repeated / multiple magnetic compensation phenomenon should be considered as a generic behavior for the admixture of the two rare earth ions belonging to different halves of 4@xmath9-series at an appropriate stoichiometry .",
    "however , the details of manifestation of such phenomenon could be different in different series , depending on the crystal structure and the magnetic anisotropy of the rare earth ions involved in the composition",
    ". a clear understanding of repeated magnetic compensation phenomenon would need comprehensive theoretical modeling of the admixed systems .",
