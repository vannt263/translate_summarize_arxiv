    "this is the fourth in a series of papers presenting results from detailed analyses of b - type eclipsing binary ( eb ) systems in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "our primary scientific goals are : 1 ) to determine an essentially complete description of the stellar properties of each system , thus providing tests and constraints for stellar evolution theory ; and 2 ) to measure precise individual distance for each system , from which the general distance to the lmc can be derived .",
    "because of its role as a fundamental calibrator for distance indicators , the lmc s distance is particularly important for determining the size scale of the universe , and its current uncertainty of 10 - 15% contributes considerably to the uncertainty in the hubble constant ( e.g. , mould et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in our previous studies",
    ", we examined the lmc eb systems hv  2274 ( guinan et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter `` paper i '' ; ribas et al .",
    "2000a ) , hv  982 ( fitzpatrick et al .",
    "2002 , `` paper ii '' ) , and eros  1044 ( ribas et al .",
    "2002 , `` paper iii '' ) .",
    "the apparent locations of these systems in the lmc can be seen in figure [ figlmc ] .",
    "the results of these analyses are beautifully consistent with expectations from stellar structure theory and provide strong constraints on the distance to the lmc . as discussed in paper iii , the three individual distances are all consistent with a mean of @xmath4 kpc , although there is a suggestion that hv  982 and , by association , perhaps the general 30 doradus region , may lie behind the lmc s `` bar '' , by several kpc .",
    "conclusions about the lmc s distance are somewhat dependent on assumptions about its spatial orientation and need to be strengthened with additional measurements from the remaining eclipsing binaries in our program . our approach is ideally suited to pursuing the issues of the spatial orientation , structure , and general distance to the lmc , since we measure precise distances to individuals systems which are widely spread across the face of the lmc .    in this paper ,",
    "we apply our analysis to a fourth lmc b - type eb , hv  5936 , and derive its stellar properties and distance .",
    "this system , with @xmath5 , stands in some contrast to those in our previous studies in both its composition and its location .",
    "hv  5936 is a semidetached system , in which the cooler , less massive component fills completely its roche lobe .",
    "thus , the currently more massive ( and more luminous ) component began its life as the junior , lower mass member of the binary .",
    "this provides an excellent opportunity to examine the characteristics of the massive component , which  due to the rapid dynamical relaxation expected to follow mass transfer  should be indistinguishable from a `` normal '' star of the same current mass .",
    "in addition to this feature , hv  5936 is located in a very different part of the lmc from our previous targets ( see fig .",
    "[ figlmc ] ) , lying several degrees north of the lmc s bar and superimposed on a well known `` hole '' in the lmc s h  i distribution ( mcgee & milton 1966 ) , corresponding to the supergiant shell lmc  4 ( meaburn 1980 ) .",
    "its distance should reflect strongly the spatial orientation of the lmc , i.e. , its inclination angle and line of nodes orientation , and could provide constraints on these factors .",
    "the structure of this paper is similar to our earlier works . in ",
    "2 we describe the data included in the study . in  3 we describe , and present the results from , our standard analysis , which incorporates the binary s light curve , radial velocity curve , and uv - through - optical spectral energy distribution .",
    "a study of the high - resolution optical spectrum of the hv  5936 components is presented in  4 .",
    "we combine all our results and give a detailed characterization of the properties and likely history of the hv  5936 system in  5 .",
    "some aspects of our results relating to the interstellar medium towards hv  5936 are described in  6 , including an indication of the relative location of hv  5936 within the lmc .",
    "finally , we derive the distance to the system and compare it with our previous results in  7 and provide some summary comments in  8 .",
    "three distinct datasets are required to carry out our analyses of the lmc eb systems : precise differential photometry ( yielding light curves ) , medium - resolution spectroscopy ( yielding radial velocity curves ) , and multiwavelength spectrophotometry ( yielding temperature and reddening information ) . each of these three datasets are described briefly below . as in our previous papers ,",
    "the primary ( @xmath6 ) and secondary ( @xmath7 ) components of the hv  5936 system are defined photometrically and refer to the hotter and cooler components , respectively .",
    "ccd differential photometric observations of hv  5936 were reported by jensen , clausen , & gimnez ( 1988 ) .",
    "these data were obtained between 1983 and 1984 with a 1.54-m telescope at the european southern observatory ( la silla , chile ) .",
    "the published light curves , obtained in the johnson @xmath8 and @xmath9 passbands , have fairly good phase coverage , with 44 and 144 measurements , respectively . according to jensen et al .",
    ", the precision of the individual differential photometric measurements is better than 0.010  mag . in this study",
    ", we adopt the orbital ephemeris determined by jensen et al .",
    ": @xmath10      radial velocity curves for hv 5936 , and a number of other lmc ebs , were derived from optical echelle spectra obtained by us during 6-night and 8-night observing runs in january and december 2000 , respectively , with the blanco 4-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory in chile .",
    "the seeing conditions during the two runs ranged between 0.7 and 1.8 arcsec .",
    "we secured eighteen spectra of hv  5936  near orbital quadratures  covering the wavelength range 36005500   , with a spectral resolution of @xmath11 , and a s / n of @xmath020:1 .",
    "the plate scale of the data is 0.08    pix@xmath12 ( 5.3  km  s@xmath12  pix@xmath12 ) and there are 2.6 pixels per resolution element .",
    "identical instrumental setups were used for both observing runs .",
    "the exposure time per spectrum was 1800 sec , sufficiently short to avoid significant radial velocity shifts during the integrations .",
    "all the hv  5936 observations were bracketed with thar comparison spectra for proper wavelength calibration .",
    "the raw images were reduced using standard noao / iraf tasks ( including bias subtraction , flat field correction , sky - background subtraction , cosmic ray removal , extraction of the orders , dispersion correction , merging , and continuum normalization ) .",
    "a typical spectrum is shown in figure [ figspec ] .",
    "the h  i balmer lines and the strongest he  i features are labeled , with arrows marking the expected line positions for the two components of the system ( according to the radial velocity curve solution described in  3.2 ) .",
    "this spectrum was obtained at orbital phase 0.30 and illustrates the clean velocity separation of the two components of the binary .    to determine the radial velocities of hv  5936 s two components from the echelle spectra",
    ", we followed the procedure described in paper ii utilizing the korel program ( hadrava 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "korel is based on the `` spectral disentangling '' technique , which assumes that an observed double - lined spectrum is a simple linear combination of two single - lined spectra whose velocities reflect the orbital properties of the system . when applied to a set of spectra",
    " obtained over a range of orbital phases  korel yields component velocities ( relative to the system barycenter ) for each individual spectrum and `` disentangled '' spectra for each of the two binary members , combining information from the whole ensemble of spectra .",
    "we applied the korel analysis to our echelle data in the 40005000   wavelength region .",
    "the h@xmath13 , h@xmath14 and h@xmath15 lines were excluded by setting the normalized flux to unity in a window around their central wavelength . to translate the velocities to the heliocentric system",
    ", we determined the systemic velocity of hv  5936 from the individual disentangled spectra .",
    "cross - correlation of these extracted spectra with a high s / n ( @xmath0250 ) observed spectrum ( hr  1443 , b2  iv - v ) and with a synthetic template yielded values consistent with a systemic velocity of @xmath16  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "table [ tabrv ] lists the heliocentric radial velocities derived from all the ctio spectra using the procedure outlined above ( `` rv@xmath17 '' and `` rv@xmath18 '' ) .",
    "also listed are the dates of observation and the corresponding phases .",
    "a large number of korel runs from different starting points were carried out to explore the parameter space and make realistic estimations of the uncertainties .",
    "a detailed discussion of these is left for  3.2 .",
    "the individual disentangled spectra of the primary and secondary provide valuable insight into the nature of the hv  5936 system , as well as confirmation of the results from our general analysis .",
    "these spectra are discussed in  4 .",
    "we obtained spectrophotometric observations of hv  5936 at uv and optical wavelengths with the _ hubble space telescope _ using both the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "these data are summarized in table [ tabhst ] .",
    "the fos observations utilized the @xmath19 aperture , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath20 .",
    "the four individual spectra were processed and calibrated using the standard pipeline processing software for the fos and then merged to form a single spectrum which covers the range 1145  to 4790  .",
    "the stis observations utilized the @xmath21 aperture , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "these data were processed and calibrated using the standard pipeline processing software .",
    "cosmic ray blemishes were cleaned `` by hand '' and the g430l and g750l spectra were trimmed to the regions 35105690  and 54107490  , respectively . because of concerns about the photometric zeropoints and stability , the two stis spectra were not merged ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "our study of hv  5936 proceeds from three separate but interdependent analyses .",
    "these involve the radial velocity curve , the light curve , and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the combined results provide essentially a complete description of the gross physical properties of the hv  5936 system and a precise measurement of its distance .",
    "each of the three analyses is described below .",
    "the fits to the light curves were carried out using an improved version of the wilson - devinney ( w - d ) program ( wilson & devinney 1971 ) that includes a model atmosphere routine developed by milone , stagg & kurucz ( 1992 ) for the computation of the stellar radiative parameters . both detailed reflection model ( mref=2 , nref=1 ) and",
    "proximity effect corrections were taken into account when fitting the light curves .",
    "the bolometric albedo and the gravity - brightening coefficients were both set at the canonical value of 1.0 for stars with radiative envelopes . for the limb darkening we used a logarithmic law as defined in klinglesmith & sobieski ( 1970 ) , with first- and second - order coefficients interpolated at each iteration for the exact @xmath23 and @xmath24 of each component from a set of tables computed in advance using a grid of atlas9 model atmospheres",
    ". a mass ratio of @xmath25 was adopted from the spectroscopic solution (  3.2 ) , and the temperature of the primary component was set to @xmath26  k , as discussed in  [ secsed ] .",
    "we have adopted a circular orbit as suggested by the equal width of the eclipses and the occurrence of the secondary eclipse at exactly phase 0.5 .",
    "further support for this comes from the fact that the system is semidetached ( see below ) and orbital circularization takes place over a very short timescale .",
    "finally , the rotational velocity of the primary star was set to 1.25 times the synchronous rate and the secondary star was adopted to rotate synchronously .",
    "a discussion of the component s rotational velocities is provided in  4 .",
    "our initial light curve fits were run with a detached configuration ( w - d mode 2 ) .",
    "however , preliminary tests indicated a rapid decrease of the surface gravitational potential of the secondary component until reaching its critical value .",
    "several runs from different starting values confirmed this behavior .",
    "therefore , all further w - d solutions were run in mode 5 , i.e. , secondary component filling its roche critical surface . according to this ,",
    "hv 5936 is a semidetached binary where the cooler , less massive component appears to be more evolved and fills its roche lobe .",
    "this is the classical configuration of post - mass transfer algol - class systems .    in our final analysis we solved for the following light curve parameters : the orbital inclination ( @xmath27 ) , the temperature of the secondary ( @xmath28 ) , the gravitational potential of the primary ( @xmath29 ) , the luminosity of the primary ( @xmath30 ) , and a phase offset ( @xmath31 ) which accounts for possible inaccuracy in the adopted ephemeris reference epoch .",
    "the iterations with the w - d code were carried out automatically until convergence , and a solution was defined as the set of parameters for which the differential corrections suggested by the program were smaller than the internal probable errors on three consecutive iterations . as a general rule ,",
    "several runs with different starting parameters are used to make realistic estimates of the uncertainties and to test the uniqueness of the solution .    because of the relatively small number of free parameters and the constraint provided by the semidetached configuration , convergence was achieved rapidly in the light curve fits .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "residuals were determined to be 0.010 , and 0.009  mag for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 light curves , respectively .",
    "these values are approximately equal to the observed scatter of the observations .",
    "the resulting orbital and physical parameters are well - defined and the best - fitting model light curves , together with the o  c residuals , are shown in figure [ figlc ] .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , a small systematic departure of the fit arises in the first quadrature ( phase 0.20.4 ) of the @xmath9 light curve .",
    "this can not be confirmed in the @xmath8 light curve because of the lack of photometric coverage .",
    "it is uncertain at this point whether this is a real effect or just an artifact of the photometric reduction .",
    "if it were real , the asymmetry of the quadrature maxima could arise from the presence of a hot spot on the primary component .",
    "this is not unexpected in an algol system because active mass transfer could be taking place and a hot spot in the atmosphere of the hotter component might arise from the impact of the accreting material and subsequent kinetic heating .",
    "we explored this scenario by running w - d solutions with an area on the primary component 10% hotter than the rest of the atmosphere .",
    "the systematic trend in the residuals did indeed disappear when the spot was included but this is not surprising because we added two new free parameters in the analysis ( spot radius and location ) .",
    "the new r.m.s .",
    "residuals were found to be 0.009 and 0.008 mag for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 light curves , respectively .",
    "the solution with the hot spot is very similar but yields a radius for the primary component about 2% smaller and a temperature ratio about 5% larger . in the absence of conclusive evidence",
    ", we decided to adopt the `` unperturbed '' solution without a hot spot .",
    "besides , the resulting spot location is not consistent with the expected impact site of a putative stream of matter using the model of lubow & shu ( 1975 ) .",
    "( note that the fractional radius of the primary component is sufficiently large to prevent the formation of a stable accretion disk ( e.g. albright & richards 1993 ) . )    as is evident from figure [ figlc ] , the light curves of hv  5936 display rather prominent out - of - eclipse variability .",
    "this arises chiefly from variations in the effective radiating area of the secondary star . due to its non - spherical shape ( filling its roche lobe ) , the surface area of the secondary star changes with the orbital phase and so does its total brightness .",
    "the stellar cross - section reaches a maximum at the orbital quadratures and a minimum at the eclipses .",
    "another factor contributing to the out - of - eclipse variation is irradiation .",
    "this is a rather significant effect in algols because the secondary star is often larger but cooler that the primary .",
    "thus , when the primary component is in front ( near the phase of the secondary eclipse ) , we see its light reflected off the atmosphere of the secondary star .",
    "this causes the ingress and egress of the secondary eclipse to be brighter than the ingress and egress of the primary eclipse .",
    "both effects discussed here are fully accounted for by the physical model upon which w - d is based , as proven by the excellent fit to the light curves .",
    "the final orbital and stellar parameters adopted from the light curve analysis are listed in table [ tabparms ] .",
    "the uncertainties given in this table were not adopted from the formal probable errors provided by the w - d code , but instead from numerical simulations and other considerations .",
    "several sets of starting parameters were tried in order to explore the full extent of the parameter space .",
    "in addition , the w - d iterations were not stopped after a solution was found , instead , the program was kept running to test the stability of the solution and the geometry of the @xmath32 function near the minimum .",
    "the scatter in the resulting parameters from numerous additional solutions yielded estimated uncertainties that we consider to be more realistic , and are generally several times larger than the internal statistical errors .",
    "as an internal consistency check , we re - analyzed the light curves with the mass ratio @xmath33 left as a free parameter , rather than fixing it to the spectroscopically determined value .",
    "this test yielded a `` photometric mass ratio '' of @xmath34 which is in excellent with the spectroscopic result of @xmath35 ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "photometric estimates of q are strongly dependent on outside - of - eclipse light variations which , in the case of hv 5936 , arise primarily from the changing aspects of the tidally distorted stars ( as well as the reflection effect ) .",
    "the good agreement of @xmath36 with the directly determined spectroscopic mass ratio indicates that the light curves are essentially free of significant perturbing effects from gas flows and accretion heating  consistent with our conclusion above from examining the residuals to the light curve fits .",
    "this agreement reaffirms that the orbital and stellar properties determined from the combined solutions of light and radial velocity curves are both self - consistent and robust .    the same light curves as analyzed here ( i.e. , from jensen et al .",
    "1988 ) have also been studied by bell et al .",
    "those authors employed two different light - curve synthesis programs , one of which was a 1983 version of the w - d code .",
    "their solutions were run with a mass ratio quite different from ours ( @xmath37 ) and this resulted in a larger fractional radius for the secondary component than we find .",
    "also , their adopted temperature for the primary was about 3000  k larger than our value . apart from those , the rest of the light curve parameters obtained by bell et al . are compatible with the ones listed in table [ tabparms ]",
    ". it should be mentioned , however , that our fits display significantly smaller residuals , which probably result from a better - determined mass ratio and the more sophisticated fitting program that we have employed .",
    "the radial velocity curve was fit using the same version of the w - d program as described above .",
    "the free parameters were : the orbital semi - major axis ( @xmath38 ) , the mass ratio ( @xmath33 ) , and a velocity zero point ( the systemic radial velocity @xmath39 ) .",
    "the rest of the parameters were set to those resulting from the light curve solutions discussed in the previous section .",
    "the best fit to the radial velocity curve is shown in figure [ figrv ] .",
    "the fit residuals correspond to r.m.s . internal errors of 1.2 and 2.8  km  s@xmath12 for the primary and secondary components , respectively .",
    "the relatively large difference between these residuals is a consequence of the secondary star being significantly less luminous , and thus its velocities have intrinsically larger errors .",
    "the parameters resulting from the radial velocity curve fit are listed in table [ tabparms ] .",
    "the uncertainties given in the table are not taken directly from the w - d output , since they fail to account for any systematic effects that could be present in the velocity data . instead , we estimated more realistic errors by considering the scatter of the velocities derived from the disentangling analysis of separate spectral regions .",
    "thus , we divided our entire spectrum into four wavelength intervals and analyzed these separately with korel .",
    "the standard deviation of the resulting velocities was found to be 3.2 and 7.5  km  s@xmath12 for the primary and secondary components , respectively .",
    "we conservatively adopted these values as the uncertainty of the velocity semiamplitudes and scaled the rest of the parameter errors listed in table [ tabparms ] accordingly .",
    "independent radial velocity observations were secured and analyzed by bell et al .",
    "according to these authors , the observations were acquired in less - than - perfect conditions , with atmospheric seeing of 36 arcsec and intermittent clouds .",
    "their resulting radial velocity curves have large scatter , with `` o  c '' residuals up to 80  km  s@xmath12 . the better quality of our radial velocity data is due to both the excellent atmospheric conditions at ctio and the use of the spectral disentangling technique , which has been proved to be superior to classical cross - correlation .",
    "when comparing the solutions , the value of the velocity that bell et al .",
    "report for the primary ( more luminous ) component is in excellent agreement with our determination listed in table [ tabparms ] .",
    "however , the velocity semiamplitude of the less luminous component , more severely affected by poor - quality observations , found by bell et al . is much smaller ( @xmath050  km  s@xmath12 ; 3.5@xmath40 ) than our value .        in general ,",
    "the observed sed @xmath41 of a binary system can be expressed as : @xmath42 \\times 10^{-0.4 e(b - v ) [ k(\\lambda - v ) + r(v)]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 @xmath44 are the surface fluxes of the primary and secondary stars , the @xmath45 are the absolute radii of the components , and @xmath46 is the distance to the binary .",
    "the last term carries the extinction information , including @xmath3 , the normalized extinction curve @xmath47 , and the ratio of selective - to - total extinction in the @xmath9 band @xmath48 . in our studies",
    ", we represent the stellar surface fluxes with r.l .",
    "atlas9 atmospheres and use a parameterized representation of uv - through - ir extinction based on the work of fitzpatrick & massa ( 1990 ) and fitzpatrick ( 1999 ; hereafter f99 ) .",
    "the kurucz models are each functions of four parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , [ m / h ] , and microturbulence velocity @xmath49 ) , and the extinction curves are functions of six parameters ( see f99 ) .",
    "note that , for the purposes of eq .",
    "[ basic1 ] , it does not matter which star in a system is identified as the primary .    we model the observed sed by performing a non - linear least squares fit to determine the best - fit values of all parameters which contribute to the right side of equation [ basic1 ] . for hv  5936",
    "( and as for our previous studies ) , we can make several simplifications which reduce the number of free parameters in the problem : ( 1 ) the temperature ratio of the two stars is known from the light curve analysis ; ( 2 ) the surface gravities can be determined by combining results from the light and radial velocity curve analyses and are log g = 3.98 and 3.49 for the primary and secondary stars , respectively ( see  5 ) ; ( 3 ) the values of [ m / h ] and @xmath49 can be assumed to be identical for both components ; ( 4 ) the ratio @xmath50 is known ; and ( 5 ) the standard mean value of @xmath51 found for the milky way can reasonably be assumed given the existing lmc measurements ( e.g. , koornneef 1982 ; morgan & nandy 1982 ; see  6 ) .",
    "we prepared the spectrophotometric datasets for the sed analysis by ( 1 ) velocity - shifting to bring the centroids of the stellar features to rest velocity ; ( 2 ) correcting for the presence of a strong interstellar h  i ly@xmath52 absorption feature in the fos spectrum at 1215.7   ( see  6 ) ; and ( 3 ) binning to match the atlas9 wavelength grid .",
    "the statistical errors assigned to each bin were computed from the statistical errors of the original data , i.e. , @xmath53 , where the @xmath54 are the statistical errors of the individual spectrophotometric data points within a bin .",
    "for all the spectra , these binned uncertainties typically lie in the range 0.5% to 1.5% of the binned fluxes .",
    "the weighting factor for each bin in the least squares procedure is given by @xmath55 .",
    "we exclude a number of individual bins from the fit ( i.e. , set the weight to zero ) for the reasons discussed by fm99 ( mainly due to the presence of interstellar gas absorption features ) .",
    "as discussed in paper ii , we do not merge the fos and stis data into a single spectrum , but rather perform the fit on the three binned spectra simultaneously and independently .",
    "we assume that the fos fluxes represent the `` true '' flux level and account for zero point uncertainties in the stis data by incorporating two zeropoint corrections ( one for each stis spectrum ) in the fitting procedure .",
    "we later explicitly determine the uncertainties in the results introduced by zeropoint uncertainties in fos .",
    "as noted in  2.1 , the out - of - eclipse variations seen in hv  5936 s light curve result primarily from changes in the apparent size ( i.e. , as presented toward the earth ) of the secondary due to its mild non - sphericity and also from phase - modulated reflection of light from the primary off the secondary .",
    "these effects must be taken into account in the sed analysis because they affect the relative contributions of primary and secondary light to the observed sed .",
    "we incorporate the effects through a simple modification of eq .",
    "[ basic1 ] : @xmath56 \\times 10^{-0.4 e(b - v ) [ k(\\lambda - v ) + r(v)]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are phase - dependent correction factors accounting for additional reflected light from the primary and the varying apparent size of the secondary , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for each of the spectrophotometric observations are listed in table [ tabhst ] and were computed from the results of the w - d light curve analysis .",
    "the @xmath57 are always greater than 1 , since reflection always adds otherwise - unseen light from the primary .",
    "the value of @xmath58 for the fos / g130h spectrum indicates that , at the phase of this observation , the apparent size of the secondary was slightly smaller than its mean value ( as given by the `` volume radius '' computed by the w - d program ) .",
    "for all the other spectra , the apparent size of the secondary was larger than its mean value .",
    "note that all the corrections for the fos datasets  which provide the photometric zeropoint for the sed analysis  are very close to 1.0 .",
    "we computed the final fit to hv  5936 s sed utilizing eq .",
    "[ basic2 ] with the appropriate values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 inserted for each dataset .",
    "as in previous papers , we adjusted the weights in the fitting procedure to yield a final value of @xmath59  since the statistical errors of the data under - represent the total uncertainties ( see the discussion in paper ii ) .",
    "this was accomplished by quadratically adding an uncertainty equivalent to 1.9% of the local binned flux to the statistical uncertainty of each flux point .",
    "( essentially identical results occur if the statistical errors are simply scaled by a factor of 2.2 to yield @xmath59 . )",
    "this value of 1.9@xmath60 gives an indication of the general quality of the fit to hv  5936 s sed , excluding the effect of statistical noise .",
    "it is comparable the quality level we have seen in the previous analyses .",
    "the best - fitting values of the energy distribution parameters for hv  5936 and their associated 1@xmath40 uncertainties ( `` internal errors '' ) are listed in tables [ tabparms ] ( stellar properties ) , [ tabstis ] ( stis offsets ) , and [ tabext ] ( extinction curve parameters ) .",
    "a comparison between the observed spectra and the best - fitting model is shown in figure [ figsed ] .",
    "the three binned spectra are plotted separately in the figure for clarity ( small filled circles ) .",
    "the zeropoint offset corrections ( see table [ tabstis ] ) were applied to all stis spectra in figure [ figsed ] . note that we show the quantity @xmath61f@xmath62 as the ordinate in figure [ figsed ] ( rather than f@xmath62 ) strictly for plotting purposes , to `` flatten out '' the energy distributions .",
    "the correction factors of 10.2% and 5.9% are required to rectify the stis g430l and g750l spectra , respectively , are similar to the results found in papers ii and iii .",
    "this apparently systematic effect probably results from small light losses in the stis @xmath63 slit .",
    "this will be tested by using a wider slit in future stis observations .",
    "in  2.2 , we utilized the korel program primarily to determine the radial velocities of hv  5936 s component stars .",
    "however , byproducts of this program , i.e. , a high - resolution , `` disentangled '' optical spectrum for each star , can provide valuable additional information on the binary system which is _ entirely independent _ of the analysis described in the preceding section .",
    "this information can be tapped by modeling these absorption line spectra with synthetic spectra .",
    "the potential value of such an analysis is threefold , since it can : 1 ) add new information on the system , 2 ) independently verify results of the preceding analysis , or 3 ) identify problems with the preceding analysis .    the disentangled spectra of hv  5936 s two components , as produced by the korel program are shown in figures [ figprim ] and [ figsecon ] .",
    "each spectrum has a resolution of @xmath00.2  and consists of 12,453 data points .",
    "the most prominent features in both are lines of h  i and he  i. the strong c  ii @xmath614267 and si  iii @xmath644553,4568,4574 lines are noted in the primary s spectrum ( fig . [ figprim ] ) .",
    "virtually all the other , weaker absorption features in that spectrum are due to lines of o  ii .",
    "there are no positive identifications of individual metal absorption lines in the noisier spectrum of the secondary .",
    "the ripple - like structure in the range 41404170  of both spectra ( near the position of a he  i line ) is an artifact of the korel program , and results because the observations were mainly obtained near orbital quadratures and not distributed more uniformly throughout the orbit .",
    "the strengths of all the lines in these two spectra are diluted by the presence of continuum light from both binary components . given the phase distribution of the original optical data ( see table 2 ) , we compute that the primary and secondary contribute 63.9% and 36.1% , respectively , of the continuum light in these mean spectra .",
    "these values incorporate the reflection and ellipticity effects noted in  3 , and have uncertainties of order @xmath01% . in figures [ figprim ] and [ figsecon ] ,",
    "we have adjusted the vertical axes so that the lines are in their correct strengths relative to the bottoms of each panel .",
    "we model the disentangled spectra by utilizing atlas9 atmospheric structure models , ivan hubeny s spectral synthesis program synspec , and essentially the same @xmath32-minimization technique as described in  3.3 for the sed analysis . in general , finding the best - fitting synthetic spectrum for these stars requires the determination of seven parameters .",
    "four of these  @xmath23 , @xmath24 , [ m / h ] , and @xmath49  are required to specify the appropriate atlas9 model .",
    "two more  @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( along with @xmath49 )  are used explicitly by synspec in determining line positions and widths .",
    "a final parameter , which we characterize as the percent contribution of each star to the observed continuum , is required to reproduce the dilution of the line strengths .",
    "for the case of the hv  5936 stars , we found that the microturbulence velocity was poorly determined and so we simply adopted the value of 2.6 km s@xmath12 derived in the sed analysis in  3.3 .",
    "in addition , we simultaneously determined the coefficients of a high - order legendre polynomial to allow the smoothing out of `` bumps and wiggles '' which can be seen in the spectra of both stars .",
    "these result from deficiencies in the normalization of the original echelle spectra used by korel .",
    "the 41404170  region , noted above , was excluded from all fits .    when analyzing the primary s spectrum we found that the results of the fitting procedure depended somewhat on the assumed order of the normalizing function .",
    "therefore , we performed 7 independent fits , utilizing 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , or 40 order legendre polynomials .",
    "these sample the reasonable range , since a polynomial with fewer than 10 orders can not match the observed structure in the continuum , while those with more than 40 orders have too much freedom and can distort the observed features .",
    "the results of these fits are given in column ( 2 ) of table [ tabfine ] where we list the simple means of the parameters derived from the 7 fits .",
    "the uncertainties quoted in the table are the quadratic sum of the internal uncertainties in a single fit and the standard deviation of the ensemble of 7 fits . in figure [ figprim ]",
    "we show the best fitting model corresponding to the case with a 20-order legendre normalizing function ( thick solid curve ) .",
    "the polynomial itself is shown by the dotted line .",
    "the results from this particular fit are very close to the ensemble averages in table [ tabfine ] .",
    "the fit to the primary s disentangled spectrum is very good .",
    "the results for @xmath23 , [ m / h ] , and the contribution factor are all consistent at the 1@xmath40 level with previous determinations ( 26,450 k , @xmath67 , and 63.9% , respectively ) .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is 0.12 dex ( @xmath02.2@xmath40 ) higher than that determined from the binary analysis .",
    "however , this is not a large discrepancy and , since the gravity determination depends on the wings of the balmer lines , we suspect it arises from deficiencies in the normalization of the original echelle spectra .",
    "it is interesting that the metallicity determined here  which mainly reflects weak but numerous lines of o  ii  agrees so well with that derived by the sed analysis  based mainly fe  ii and iii absorption in the uv .",
    "these two results present a very consistent picture of a general factor - of-4 metal underabundance for hv  5936 .",
    "note that all of the fits to the primary s spectrum assume a helium abundance of @xmath68 , which is based on the observed metal abundance and standard chemical enrichment laws ( see  5 ) and corresponds to a helium mass fraction of @xmath69 .",
    "fits to the secondary s spectrum were performed in a similar manner as above except that  since the optical metal lines are all too weak to allow a meaningful determination of [ m / h ]  we fixed it s value to @xmath70 = -0.63 $ ] as derived in  3 .",
    "also , we found that the 10-order legendre fit was inadequate to model the continuum undulations and so we base our results on 6 fits with normalization polynomials of 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40 orders .",
    "the resulting mean parameters and 1@xmath40 uncertainties from these fits are listed in column ( 3 ) of table [ tabfine ] .",
    "these results are much less satisfying than for the primary .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the contribution factor all differ greatly from the previously determined values ( 17,600 k , 3.49 , and 36.1% , respectively ) .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath71 appears inconsistent with the virtually unavoidable requirement that the secondary s rotation be tidally locked to its orbit ( see  5 ) .    from detailed examination of the fits to the secondary",
    ", we found that the discrepancies arise essentially because the secondary s he  i lines are too strong to be well - fit with the temperature of 17,600 k inferred earlier in  3 .",
    "it is not likely , however , that the secondary can be significantly hotter than this , since this temperature results from a very well - determined eclipse - based temperature ratio and an apparently well - determined primary star temperature .",
    "rather , we suggest that the secondary s he  i lines are enhanced in strength arising from a modest enhancement in the he surface abundance . the viability of this suggestion is demonstrated by case ii in column ( 4 ) of table [ tabfine ] .",
    "the mean parameters and 1@xmath40 uncertainties were derived in an identical manner to those in case i , except that the helium abundance was approximately doubled to a value of @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , the abundances of c and o were depleted by a factor of 10 , compared to the base metallicity of [ m / h ] = -0.626 , and n was enhanced by a factor of 70 .",
    "these factors are based on stellar interior models which will be discussed below in  5 .",
    "it is clear that these adjustments to the elemental abundances yield results completely consistent with the previous measurements of @xmath73 and @xmath24 for the secondary and the known value of the continuum contribution factor .",
    "in addition the value of @xmath71 is well - determined and consistent with synchronous rotation ( see  5 ) . in figure [ figsecon ]",
    "we show the best - fitting model corresponding to case ii with a 25-order legendre normalizing function ( thick solid curve ) .",
    "the results from this particular fit are very close to the ensemble averages in column ( 4 ) table [ tabfine ] .    the value of @xmath74 used in case ii was not arrived at arbitrarily .",
    "rather , we ran a set of fits to the secondary s spectrum ( each with a different order legendre polynomial ) with @xmath73 held fixed at the value of 17,600 k found in  3 and with the he abundance as a free parameter .",
    "( @xmath23 and @xmath75 are degenerate in their effects and can not both be determined from fitting the spectrum . ) this set of models resulted in a best - fitting he abundance of @xmath76 , which we rounded off to use in case ii . the significance of this result as an indicator of a true he enhancement can be gauged from a similar analysis of the primary .",
    "a set of fits of the primary s spectrum , with @xmath23 fixed at 26,450 k ( from the sed analysis ) and the he abundance as a free parameter , yielded a best fitting he abundance of @xmath77 .",
    "this is consistent with that inferred in  5 below , from the metallicity of the system and chemical enrichment laws .",
    "our conclusions from analysis of the high - resolution disentangled optical spectra of hv  5936 are twofold : 1 ) the primary s absorption line spectrum is completely consistent with the stellar properties derived in  3 , given the random errors and small systematic effects which may have arisen during the processing and `` disentangling '' of the spectra ; and 2 ) the secondary s spectrum is consistent with the derived properties only if a @xmath0factor - of-2 enhancement is assumed in the surface he abundance , as compared to that of the primary . in  5 below we consider the plausibility of a he enhancement in the secondary .",
    "we summarize the basic physical properties of the hv  5936 system in table [ tabstar ] .",
    "the notes to the table indicate how the individual stellar properties were derived from the results of the preceding sections . a scale model of the system",
    "is shown in figure [ fig3d ] .",
    "the locations of the hv  5936 components in the @xmath78 vs. @xmath79 diagram are shown in figure [ fighrd ] , where the skewed rectangular boxes indicate the 1@xmath40 error loci ( recall that errors in @xmath23 and @xmath80 are correlated ) .",
    "the position of the zero age main sequence ( zams ) is indicated in figure 9 by the thick curve ; the theoretical evolution tracks shown on the figure will be discussed below .",
    "examination of figure [ fighrd ] and table [ tabstar ] suggests a paradox , in that the more evolved star ( i.e. , farthest from the zams ) is the less massive component of the pair .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this scenario is that hv  5936 is a post - mass transfer system , as commonly argued to explain the so - called `` algol paradox . ''",
    "the originally more massive star evolved beyond the roche critical surface at a certain point and some fraction of its mass was transferred to its companion .",
    "after that process , the mass - accreting component became more massive than the mass - donor , and this is the current status of the system .",
    "in contrast with our previous studies , the strong interaction between the system components prevents us from using evolutionary models to perform a critical self - consistency check of the results .",
    "i.e. , a single isochrone is not expected to fit both components of the system because of their history of mass transfer . however , comparison with theoretical evolution tracks is still instructive .",
    "thus , we considered the evolutionary models of claret ( 1995 , 1997 ) and claret & gimnez ( 1995 , 1998 ) ( altogether referred to as the cg models ) .",
    "these models cover a wide range in both metallicity ( @xmath81 ) and initial helium abundance ( @xmath82 ) , incorporate the most modern input physics , and use a value of 0.2  h@xmath83 as the convective overshooting parameter . in our particular case , we adopted the metal abundance from the sed fit ( see table [ tabstar ] ) , which results in a value of @xmath84 . using this metal abundance ,",
    "the empirical chemical law of ribas et al .",
    "( 2000b ) yields a helium abundance of @xmath85 , corresponding to @xmath69 .",
    "( the analysis of the disentangled spectrum of the primary in  4 provides a remarkable confirmation of this result . )    in figure [ fighrd ] we show the cg models for masses of 11.6  m@xmath86 and 4.7  m@xmath86 , corresponding to the masses measured for the hv  5936 components . despite its history of significant mass gain , the primary component has a luminosity in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations for a star of its mass and radius .",
    "this is not surprising since it has been shown that the hydrodynamical relaxation time of the accretion process is short enough so that the mass - gaining component in a non - conservative system is expected to behave like a normal star of its mass and radius ( de grve 1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "empirical proof of this has been obtained from the study of galactic algol systems ( garca & gimnez 1990 ) .",
    "the secondary , on the other hand , is significantly over - luminous for its current mass .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior exhibited by the mass - donors in galactic algol systems ( giuricin , mardirossian , & mezzetti 1983 ; hilditch & bell 1987 ) .",
    "the rotational velocity determined from the disentangled spectrum for the secondary is consistent with synchronization with the orbit ( compare the values of @xmath71 and @xmath87 in table [ tabstar ] ) .",
    "this is expected since the secondary completely fills its roche lobe and tidal forces are very efficient at locking the star s spin rate to follow the orbital motion .",
    "this agreement between observations and theoretical expectations provides a consistency check on the measurements of @xmath71 , stellar radius , and orbital properties .",
    "the primary component , however , is seen to have a rotational velocity that is @xmath025% larger than the synchronization value .",
    "the departure from unity is well beyond the observational uncertainties  but is not unprecedented or unexpected .",
    "the primaries of numerous galactic algol systems have been determined to rotate faster than their synchronous rate and even close to the centrifugal limit ( see , e.g. , van hamme & wilson 1990 ) . a rotational velocity 25% larger than synchronicity is well within the observed range .",
    "angular momentum transfer through mass accretion is probably the most plausible model to explain the spin - up of algol primaries ( huang 1966 ) .",
    "the @xmath0factor - of-2 enhancement observed in the secondary s surface he abundance , as discussed in  4 , provides a strong constraint on the original masses of the stars in the hv  5936 system , particularly the secondary .",
    "the nature of this constraint is as follows : the initial mass of the current secondary must have been such that , by the time the star evolved to fill its roche lobe ( and commence mass transfer ) , the point in its interior where the he abundance was twice the surface value was at a radius which enclosed 4.7  @xmath1 of material ( i.e. , the current mass of the secondary ) .",
    "this interior point  now at the surface of the secondary  clearly must have been in the outer regions of its original h - burning core .    to exploit this constraint , we considered the evolution of 4 different simulated binary systems , constructed with the assumptions of : 1 ) non - conservative mass exchange with 50% efficiency in the transfer of mass from the donor star to the mass gaining star and 2 ) a fractional angular momentum loss proportional to the fractional mass lost to the system .",
    "the initial masses of these systems were 12  @xmath1 ( current secondary ) + 8  @xmath1 ( current primary ) , 14  @xmath1 + 7  @xmath1 , 16  @xmath1 + 6  @xmath1 , and 18  @xmath1 + 5  @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations were done following the formalism in torres , neuhuser , & wichmann ( 1998 ) but considering the non - conservative mass transfer expression in vanbeveren et al .",
    "( 1979 ) . from these",
    ", we estimate initial orbital periods of 1.154 , 1.318 , 1.689 , and 2.449 days , and initial roche lobe radii of 4.8 , 5.2 , 6.1 , 7.8 , and 10.7  @xmath88 , respectively , for the four mass combinations .",
    "the results showed that each of the systems experiences case a mass transfer ( i.e. , occurring during the core hydrogen burning phase of the mass donor ) and all could eventually evolve to the configuration observed for hv  5936  but with different resultant surface he abundances for the mass donor . using internal composition profiles computed by one of us ( a.c . ) , we find that the surface he abundances of the initially 12  @xmath1 , 14  @xmath1 , 16  @xmath1 , and 18  @xmath1 mass donors are enhanced by factors of 1.5 , 2.6 , 3.0 , and 3.5 , respectively , by the time donor has been reduced to 4.7  @xmath1 .",
    "the observed enhancement of @xmath02.0 is roughly midway between the 12  @xmath1 and 14  @xmath1 cases .",
    "taking into account all the results above , we postulate that the hv  5936 system began with initial masses of @xmath013  @xmath1 and @xmath07.5@xmath89 for the current secondary and current primary , respectively .",
    "case a mass exchange then resulted in the observed current masses of the components , the spinning up of the primary to a rotational rate faster than the synchronous rate , and the uncovering of processed material in the atmosphere of the secondary .",
    "the estimated initial mass of the secondary depends only weakly on our assumption of a 50% mass transfer efficiency ( which is probably an upper limit ) .",
    "the primary s initial mass is much more sensitive to this assumption , although it might be possible to constrain it further ( and thus the transfer efficiency ) by considering the spin - up process . along with the he enhancement ,",
    "the secondary s surface should also exhibit a @xmath070@xmath90 enhancement of @xmath91n and a @xmath010@xmath90 depletion of @xmath92c and @xmath93o , according to our interior composition models .",
    "these enhancements and depletions were assumed in the case ii modeling of the secondary s disentangled spectrum as discussed in  4 above . because of the already low metallicity of this lmc star , the modifications in cno abundances do not have striking effect on the secondary s spectrum . in figure [ figsecon ]",
    "we indicate the locations of the most prominent n ii lines . even with their enhanced abundances , these lines are too weak to claim a positive detection , although there do appear to be features in the spectrum at their locations .",
    "higher quality spectra will be required to confirm their presence and , thus , the surface enhancement of n.",
    "our analysis of hv  5936 provides some insight into the conditions of the interstellar medium along the line of sight to the system . in this section",
    "we examine this information and also show how these data help constrain the relative position of hv  5936 within the lmc .",
    "the column density of interstellar h  i in the foreground of hv  5936 was measured by comparing the observed h  i ly@xmath52 1216.7  absorption line profile ( using the unbinned fos data ) with theoretical profiles consisting of a synthetic stellar spectrum convolved with an interstellar absorption profile . in general , the interstellar profile is constructed by assuming a component at 0 km s@xmath12 with @xmath94  @xmath95 , corresponding to milky way foreground gas ( see , e.g. , schwering & israel 1991 ) , and a second component with a lmc - like velocity and a column density which is varied to produce the best fit to the data ( as judged by visual inspection ) .    in examining the fos data for hv  5936 , we found no evidence for h  i absorption at lmc velocities , and a milky way contribution at 0 km s@xmath12 of @xmath96 , slightly less than , but consistent with , the mean value of schwering & israel .",
    "the best - fitting ly@xmath52 profile is shown in figure [ fighi ] , where we illustrate the unbinned fos spectrum , the synthetic stellar spectrum ( dotted line ) and the convolution of the synthetic spectrum with the interstellar profile ( thick solid curve ) .",
    "note that the bottom of the ly@xmath52 profile is filled in by geocoronal emission .",
    "this notable absence of neutral lmc interstellar gas towards hv  5936 is consistent with the interstellar reddening results .",
    "the value of @xmath97 found for hv  5936 from the sed analysis is essentially identical to the mean value for 56 milky way foreground stars within 1 of the hv  5936 line - of - sight ( @xmath98 from the data of oestreicher , gochermann , & schmidt - kaler 1995 ) .",
    "thus , there is no measurable contribution to @xmath99 from lmc material .",
    "the lack of large amounts of lmc gas and dust towards hv  5936 provides an opportunity to examine some properties of the milky way ism along a sightline passing completely through the milky way s halo  but free of extragalactic contamination .",
    "in particular , the gas - to - dust ratio for this material is @xmath100",
    "@xmath95  mag@xmath12 , which is roughly twice the value found in the galactic disk and suggests a `` cleaner '' ism in the halo .",
    "in addition , the wavelength - dependent extinction curve derived from the sed analysis is now recognized to be a measure of the extinction properties of galactic halo dust grains .",
    "this curve is shown in figure [ figext ] where the small symbols indicate the normalized ratio of model fluxes to observed fluxes , while the thick solid line shows the parameterized representation of the extinction curve , which was actually determined by the fitting process .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this curve is the very weak 2175  bump , which may be the weakest bump ever seen in milky way dust .",
    "the curve is consistent with the results of kiszkurno - koziej & lequeux ( 1987 ) , which show a weak trend of weakening bump strength and steepening 15001800  extinction with increasing height above the galactic plane .",
    "the shape of the hv  5936 curve is very similar to those seen towards hv  982 and eros  1044 ( papers ii and iii ) , whose total extinctions are dominated by milky way dust .",
    "the ism results for hv  5936 provide constraints on the position of the system within the lmc .",
    "its apparent location places it within the outlines of lmc-4 , the largest supergiant h  ii shell in the lmc ( goudis & meaburn 1978 ; meaburn 1980 ) .",
    "the shell has a diameter of @xmath01.1 kpc , and hv  5936 is positioned ne of the shell center and near the inside edge . a hint of the shell can be seen in figure [ figlmc ] .",
    "the position of the shell coincides with a `` hole '' in the h  i distribution ( mcgee & milton 1966 ) .",
    "the h  i 21-cm emission line data of rohlfs et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , obtained with a half - power beam width of 15 , reveal a total lmc h  i column density of @xmath101 at the position of hv  5936 , with higher values to the east and comparable values in other directions .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath102 seen in the general vicinity of hv  5936 is @xmath103 , at a position 04 west of the system .",
    "while we have not established a rigorous upper limit for the non - detection of lmc h  i ly@xmath52 absorption towards hv  5936 , such a limit is certainly below @xmath104 . thus , while we can not rule out the presence of localized , deep holes in the ism distribution , the simplest explanation of both the hv  5936 gas and dust results is that the system lies at an undetermined distance above the main h  i layer at its apparent location on the lmc .",
    "the discussion in  5 demonstrates that , despite the interesting evolutionary state of the hv  5936 system and the mass exchange that has occurred , the stellar properties appear well - determined and well - understood .",
    "particularly , the properties of the primary star are indistinguishable from those of a `` normal '' single star , which came by its mass through the normal star - formation process .",
    "we can thus determine a distance to the system based on the results for the primary star , by combining its absolute radius @xmath105 ( derived from the classical eb analysis ) with the distance attenuation factor @xmath106 ( derived from the sed analysis ) .",
    "we find @xmath107 kpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath108 mag .",
    "the uncertainty in the distance is estimated from considering three independent sources of error : ( 1 ) the internal measurement errors in @xmath105 and @xmath106 as given in table [ tabparms ] ; ( 2 ) uncertainty in the appropriate value of the extinction parameter @xmath109 ; and ( 3 ) uncertainty in the fos flux scale zeropoint due to calibration errors and instrument stability .",
    "straightforward propagation of errors shows that these three factors yield individual uncertainties of @xmath110 kpc , @xmath111 kpc ( assuming @xmath112 ) , and @xmath113 kpc ( assuming @xmath114% ) , respectively .",
    "the overall 1@xmath40 uncertainty quoted above is the quadratic sum of these three errors .",
    "it is dominated by the uncertainty in the primary s radius , which alone accounts for 1.7 kpc in the error budget .",
    "note that the only `` adjustable '' factor in the analysis is the extinction parameter @xmath109 , for which we have assumed the value 3.1 .",
    "because of the very low reddening of the system , our distance result is very insensitive to this assumption .",
    "the weak dependence of the distance modulus on @xmath109 is given by : @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "we have considered the possibility that this distance result may be tainted due to the advanced evolutionary state of the secondary star . in general , the light curve and radial velocity curve analyses are very insensitive to the natures of the eb s components , i.e. , the temperature ratio of the two stars , their mean radii , surface gravities , and relative contributions to the observed light in the optical spectral region are virtually model - independent and very well - determined .",
    "these results tightly constrain the sed analysis and so it would seem that the results could be compromised only if the secondary s sed departs significantly from the shape predicted by an atlas9 model of the derived @xmath23 , @xmath24 , [ m / h ] , and @xmath49 values .",
    "the evidence , however , suggests that this is not the case . in support , we note the high quality of the fit to the combined sed of the system , which is comparable to our previous studies of systems containing wholly `` normal '' stars , and the consistency between the sed analysis and the independent modeling of the disentangled optical spectra ( see  4 ) .",
    "the only anomaly found is the probable modest enhancement of the secondary s he abundance , which would have only very small effect on the star s sed .",
    "we have run a number of tests with the sed analysis , arbitrarily modifying the secondary s sed ( by varying @xmath23 , @xmath24 , [ m / h ] , or @xmath116 ) .",
    "even relatively large changes have little effect on the derived system distance , because of the dominance of the primary in the combined sed .",
    "we thus conclude , based both on a lack of contrary evidence and on the apparent robustness of the result , that uncertainties arising from the evolutionary state of the secondary are likely significantly smaller than the other sources of error noted above .    in table",
    "[ tabdist ] we show the individual system distances for hv  5936 and the other ebs in our study .",
    "we also list the implied distances to a standard reference point in the lmc , based on the assumption that the ebs are all located within a flat disk - like lmc whose spatial orientation is specified by an inclination angle and a position angle for the line of nodes in the plane of the sky .",
    "we choose the optical center of the lmc s bar as the reference point and show two sets of lmc distances , based on two different assumptions about the lmc s spatial orientation .",
    "details are given in the notes to the table .",
    "the results for hv  5936 in table [ tabdist ] clearly stand out from the others .",
    "this is partially explained by projection effects .",
    "because hv  5936 lies relatively far from the adopted reference point and in the `` nearside '' of the lmc , it is expected to be somewhat closer than the other systems . however , when the projection is taken into account , the distance implied for the lmc reference point is @xmath117 kpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath118 ( from taking a simple mean of the two cases shown in table [ tabdist ] ) .",
    "this is about 2@xmath40 away from the mean of the other systems and suggests that the assumption that all the systems lie in the same flat disk may be invalid .",
    "although the relatively large uncertainty in the hv  5936 result prevents definitive conclusions , we suggest that hv  5936 lies `` above '' the extrapolated position of the lmc s disk .",
    "this notion is consistent with , and actually suggested by , the interstellar results , which reveal no evidence for absorption by lmc h  i and no measurable extinction by lmc dust along the hv  5936 sightline .",
    "this interpretation of the ism data is complicated by the coincidence of hv  5936 s position in the sky with the supergiant shell lmc  4 , towards which a very low h  i 21-cm emission column density is observed .",
    "depending on the patchiness of the h  i , it is conceivable that a star located within or even behind lmc  4 could show an undetectably low h  i absorption column density .",
    "this seems unlikely for hv  5936 , however , since it is located near the eastern edge of the lmc  4 , where the 21-cm column density is @xmath119 and rises steeply towards the east .",
    "the simplest explanation is that hv  5936 just lies in front of most of the lmc s interstellar matter .",
    "it is not clear why hv  5936 should occupy such a position , although this might well be related to the formation of shell lmc  4 itself .",
    "likewise , it remains to be seen whether hv  5936 is a pathological object , in terms of its location , or is merely representative of a spatially extended stellar population in the ne quadrant of the lmc .",
    "alternative explanations for the hv  5936 results include assuming simple error in the spatial orientation of the lmc or perhaps a major structural feature , such as a warp , in the lmc s disk .",
    "the latter may arise from strong past interactions between the magellanic clouds and the milky way galaxy .",
    "both hypotheses would allow hv  5936 to lie close to the lmc s disk ( but still above , given the ism results ) , but require the disk to be closer to us than currently assumed .",
    "unfortunately for these ideas , the required orientation for the lmc would necessitate an inclination angle ( @xmath120 ) much steeper than previolusly measured .",
    "moreover , structural studies of the lmc have revealed no evidence of a warp in the vicinity of hv  5936 ( e.g. , see olsen & salyk 2002 ) .",
    "the analysis presented here for hv  5936 has differed somewhat from those reported previously in papers i , ii , and iii . here",
    "our efforts have been focused more strongly on the physical properties of the stellar components and the evolutionary history of the binary system , rather than on the distance measurement .",
    "this arises from the interesting evolutionary state of this semidetached system and from its outlying location in the lmc . because of its location , the implications of hv  5936 s individual distance for the distance to the lmc as a whole is not as firmly established as for our previously analyzed systems .",
    "it is worth noting that hv  5936 is the first semidetached eb system to be used as a distance indicator for the lmc .",
    "although our current analysis shows that semidetached binaries can be used successfully as such , there are a number of complications that call for the careful use of these systems . among the related problems are : _ 1 ) _ the lack of evolutionary cross checks , _ 2 ) _ the often very unequal component masses , effective temperatures and luminosities that complicate the spectrophotometric analysis , _ 3 ) _ the large out - of - eclipse variations and distortions , and _ 4 ) _ the relative radii that are strongly dependent on the adopted mass ratio",
    "our success with hv  5936 springs directly from the high quality observations available , in which the spectroscopic and photometric signatures of both stars are clearly present and separable .",
    "future distance studies within our program will be focused primarily on non - interacting systems lying closer to the apparent center of the lmc .",
    "we currently have four detached systems under analysis , all of which can be expected to yield accurate distances and a number of cross checks to verify the results .",
    "in addition , two of these systems , eros 1066 and macho 053648.7@xmath121691700 ( see figure 1 ) , have been especially selected to provide insight into the possible problem of line - of - sight extension of the lmc .",
