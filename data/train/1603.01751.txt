    "impulsive systems @xcite arise in many applications such as such as ecology @xcite , epidemiology @xcite and sampled - data systems / control @xcite .",
    "lyapunov - based methods and dwell - time notions @xcite can be used to establish various stability concepts and conditions .",
    "various concepts of dwell - time have been considered over the past decades .",
    "important examples are the minimum dwell - time @xcite , the average dwell - time @xcite , the persistent dwell - time @xcite , the maximum dwell - time @xcite , the ranged - dwell - time @xcite and the mode - dependent dwell - time @xcite .",
    "notably , minimum dwell - time stability conditions for linear impulsive systems have been obtained in @xcite following the ideas developed in @xcite in the context of switched systems .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that despite a sufficient stability condition can be expressed as a tractable linear matrix inequality problem , this type of conditions are only applicable to linear time - invariant systems without uncertainties and are impossible to convert into design conditions , even in the simple case of state - feedback design @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks motivated the consideration of _ looped - functionals _",
    "@xcite , a particular class of indefinite functionals satisfying a certain boundary condition , referred to as the _ looping - condition_. these functionals have the merit of leading to conditions that are convex in the matrices of the system , hence easily applicable to linear uncertain systems with time - varying uncertainties and to nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "the price to pay for these interesting properties is that the resulting conditions are infinite - dimensional semidefinite programs , that may then be solved using discretization techniques @xcite or sum of squares programming @xcite . due to the presence of additional infinite - dimensional decision functions ,",
    "the complexity of the conditions may not scale very well with the dimension of the system and/or the number of basis functions used to express infinite - dimensional variables .",
    "moreover , looped - functionals are limited to stability analysis and are difficult to consider for design purposes . to circumvent this problem , _ clock - dependent conditions _ have been considered in @xcite where it is shown that these conditions possess the same advantages than looped - functional conditions ( i.e. the possibility of considering nonlinear and uncertain linear systems ) together with the additional possibility of using them for design purposes . despite these frameworks",
    "have been recently shown to be theoretically equivalent in @xcite , because the same accuracy is attained with a lower computational cost , it is then preferable to use clock - dependent stability conditions rather than looped - functional - based ones .",
    "we propose to address here the case of stochastic impulsive systems where the continuous - time part consists of a linear stochastic differential equation with state multiplicative noise @xcite and the discrete - time part is a stochastic difference equation @xcite .",
    "the impulses arrival times are considered here as purely time - dependent and deterministic .",
    "stochastic hybrid systems have been extensively studied in the literature ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , very few address the case where both parts of the impulsive system are affected by noise @xcite and , when this is the case , average dwell - time conditions , state - dependent impulse times or stochastically arriving impulses @xcite are most of the time only considered .",
    "the main goal of the paper is therefore to develop stability conditions in the same spirit as in @xcite where the deterministic case was considered . to this aim ,",
    "we consider the notion of dwell - times and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition characterizing the mean - square stability under constant dwell - time , and sufficient conditions establishing the mean - square stability under ranged and minimum dwell - time conditions .",
    "these conditions , albeit stated in a more implicit way , naturally generalize those obtained in the deterministic setting as they reduce to the deterministic conditions when the noise - related terms are set to zero .",
    "due to the implicit structure of the conditions , they can not be checked per se . in order to overcome this difficulty , and in the same spirit as in @xcite , lifted versions of the conditions expressed as clock - dependent linear matrix inequalities are considered .",
    "these conditions have the benefits of being convex in the matrices of the system , a property that enables their use in the contexts of uncertain systems and control design . because these conditions are infinite - dimensional , they can not be checked directly and need to be relaxed .",
    "possible relaxation methods include the approximation of infinite - dimensional variables using a piecewise - linear approximation @xcite or the use of sum of squares programming @xcite .",
    "it is emphasized that these relaxed conditions are asymptotically exact in the sense that they can approximate arbitrarily well the original conditions they have been derived from .",
    "these conditions are shown to include those of @xcite , which characterize the mean - square stability stochastic linear switched systems , by exploiting the possibility of representing switched systems as impulsive systems .",
    "the approach is then non - conservatively extended to state - feedback design , for which convex conditions are also obtained .",
    "finally , the analysis and control of aperiodic stochastic sampled - data systems is performed using the proposed method by reformulating the considered sampled - data system into an impulsive system .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that sampled - data systems driven by multiplicative noise do not seem to have been thoroughly considered in the literature .",
    "this paper therefore fills this gap by providing tractable conditions for both the analysis and the control of such systems .",
    "various comparative examples demonstrate the accuracy and tractability of the approach .",
    "* outline : * the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : preliminary ] preliminary definitions and results are given .",

    "<S> impulsive systems are a very flexible class of systems that can be used to represent switched and sampled - data systems . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to extend here the previously obtained results on deterministic impulsive systems to the stochastic setting . </S>",
    "<S> the concepts of mean - square stability and dwell - times are utilized in order to formulate relevant stability conditions for such systems . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are formulated as convex clock - dependent linear matrix inequality conditions that are applicable to robust analysis and control design , and are verifiable using discretization or sum of squares techniques . </S>",
    "<S> stability conditions under various dwell - time conditions are obtained and non - conservatively turned into state - feedback stabilization conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the results are finally applied to the analysis and control of stochastic sampled - data systems . </S>",
    "<S> several comparative examples demonstrate the accuracy and the tractability of the approach .    </S>",
