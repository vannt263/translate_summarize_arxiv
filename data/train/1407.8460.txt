    "we use that @xmath7 can be written as the union of the ranges of a poissonian cloud of independent random walks and the fact that random walks tend to avoid sticks if @xmath56 is large enough ( c.f .  ) to arrive at a large deviation estimate on the probability that the number of frames that intersect @xmath7 is @xmath47 which is strong enough to beat the combinatorial complexity term @xmath57 .",
