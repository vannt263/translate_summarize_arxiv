    "spin - orbit coupling , an intrinsic property of electrons in solids , is at the root of many phenomena currently attracting a great deal of attention in condensed matter physics .",
    "the topological insulators are a prime example of a novel material class of which spin - orbit coupling is a key characteristic  @xcite .",
    "the importance of spin - orbit coupling is most clearly reflected in the spin - momentum locking of the celebrated dirac surface states mandated by nontrivial bulk topology . in two dimensions",
    "graphene is a topological insulator in the presence of spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , however , in practice the spin - orbit interaction turns out to be too weak .    whereas the topological insulators have been successfully described in terms of non - interacting electron band theory , spin - orbit coupled mott insulators  @xcite are materials for which strong correlation effects are important .",
    "the iridium - based oxides provide hallmark examples of spin - orbit coupled materials where electron interactions have been proposed to give rise to intriguing phases of matter such as kitaev spin liquids  @xcite , magnetic - order - induced weyl semimetals  @xcite , and quantum critical nodal non - fermi liquids  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is key , since it breaks spin - rotation symmetry and thus allows , for instance , for kitaev - type terms in the spin hamiltonians of effective local moments describing these materials .    in both these cases , topological insulators and spin - orbit coupled mott insulators ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is intrinsic and of relativistic origin .",
    "spin - orbit coupling can , however , also be dynamically generated in nonrelativistic systems by interactions .",
    "instabilities of the fermi liquid can lead to condensation of particle - hole pairs into nematic phases with anisotropic distortions of the fermi surface  @xcite , possibly in combination with time - reversal symmetry breaking  @xcite , or into isotropic spin - orbit coupled phases  @xcite .",
    "such electronic orders belong to the class of phases called electronic liquid crystals  @xcite , which are quantum analogs of classical liquid crystals , as they exhibit symmetry breaking but remain metallic .    in this work ,",
    "we show how aspects of these three phenomena involving spin - orbit coupling ( i.e. , dynamic generation of spin - orbit coupling , electron correlation , and nontrivial topology ) come together in two - dimensional systems with hexagonal symmetry . specifically , we study density wave formation , i.e. , condensation of particle - hole pairs , at finite commensurate wave vectors associated with nested van hove singularities .",
    "our study comprises a classification of density waves in the spin channel , referred to as _",
    "density waves  @xcite , building on previous work which has focused on the singlet channel  @xcite .",
    "one of our main results is to show that multi - component density waves with nonzero ( commensurate ) wave vector in 2d can be mapped to and classified as condensates of particle - hole pairs with nonzero angular momentum in three dimensions ( 3d ) . for the triplet case",
    "this establishes a connection between the phenomenology of multi - component spin density wave states and spin - orbit coupled @xmath6 and @xmath5 liquid crystal phases  @xcite .",
    "the latter are particle - hole analogs of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 phases of superfluid @xmath9he  @xcite .",
    "van hove singularities connected by inequivalent commensurate wave vectors generically occur for electrons in simple hexagonal lattices such as the triangular and honeycomb lattices when doped to band structure saddle points .",
    "doped graphene is a notable example  @xcite .",
    "the van hove singularities are located at the three centers of the brillouin zone edges , i.e. , the @xmath0 points ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bzhexa ] ) , and the wave vectors connecting them are the @xmath0-point vectors themselves .    a number of studies have addressed the effect of interactions between the three flavors of saddle point electrons , predicting exciting unconventional correlated phases such as topological chiral superconductivity , as well as chern - insulating chiral spin density waves @xcite .",
    "these works highlight the rich physics expected in a broad class of ( doped ) hexagonal materials , with doped graphene as a concrete example .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a comprehensive classification for density wave states that can arise when multi - flavor saddle - point electrons condense .",
    "known phases such as the chiral and uniaxial spin density wave are shown to be natural products of such a classification .",
    "in addition , we find novel density wave states with topological quasiparticle spectra and hidden order .",
    "we now give a brief overview of the content of this work and summarize the main results .      in this work",
    ", we present a symmetry classification of hexagonal triplet @xmath0-point order . at the heart of such classification",
    "is the notion of extended point group symmetry . extended point groups are crystal point groups supplemented with those lattice translations that do not map the enlarged unit cell , i.e. , the unit cell defined by the ordering vector of the density wave , to itself . consequently , extended point groups provide a natural and systematic way to study particle - hole condensation at finite commensurate wave vector , as density waves can be classified in terms of extended point group representations in the same way as angular momentum channels are labeled by point group representations  @xcite .    in previous work we have analyzed hexagonal lattice @xmath0-point order in the singlet channel using extended point group symmetry  @xcite and found a set of charge density ( @xmath10 ) waves , in addition to a set of time - reversal odd charge - current density ( @xmath11 ) waves .",
    "both sets of orders correspond to nesting instabilities . on the basis of that analysis",
    ", here we address the triplet variants of these orders .",
    "the triangular and honeycomb lattices will serve as examples of systems with hexagonal symmetry to which our analysis and results apply , with an emphasis on the triangular lattice .",
    "a central theme of our study is dynamically generated spin - orbit coupling . by spin - orbit coupling here",
    "we mean the coupling of the spin and angular momentum of the particle - hole pairs in the condensed phase .",
    "the concept of dynamically generated spin - orbit coupling is introduced in more detail in the next section , where we consider @xmath2 condensation .",
    "@xmath2 condensation is caused by pomeranchuk - type fermi liquid instabilities and gives rise to phases that exhibit ( anisotropic ) fermi surface distortions as a result of ( rotational ) symmetry breaking  @xcite . in systems with hexagonal symmetry ,",
    "spin - orbit coupled phases of the general form @xmath12 with @xmath13 a linear combination of degenerate @xmath11-wave form factors ( relevant at van hove doping ) , can be distinguished by total angular momentum quantum numbers , as we explain in more detail in the following .",
    "one of such orders , the @xmath14 @xmath5-phase  @xcite , is favored when nesting is weak  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of @xmath2 @xmath11-wave orders , highlighting the coupling of degenerate orbitals to spin , will set the stage for the classification and study of triplet @xmath0-point order of the general form @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bzhexa ] ) . as a first step",
    ", we will consider the nesting instabilities at the @xmath0 points in the spin channel , i.e. , the triplet @xmath0-point instabilities .",
    "based on the nesting instabilities and their symmetry properties , we will derive and discuss three main results .    _",
    "( i ) _ we show that the @xmath10-wave and @xmath11-wave nesting instabilities map to sets of @xmath17 and @xmath4 angular momenta , respectively , transforming as partners of representations of the cubic group @xmath18 .",
    "this result is established by constructing a mapping between elements of the extended hexagonal point group @xmath19 and elements of the cubic group , realizing an isomorphism between the two groups . using this mapping",
    ", we will demonstrate that coupling the @xmath20 orbitals to spin ( @xmath21 ) , in the same spirit as the @xmath2 @xmath11-waves , defines a symmetry classification of hexagonal triplet @xmath0-point order : total angular momentum @xmath22 becomes a symmetry label for density waves .",
    "we argue that , from the perspective of symmetry and phenomenology , we can interpret distinct triplet @xmath0-point orders as electronic liquid crystal ( @xmath6 and @xmath5 ) phases of a 3d fermi liquid with cubic symmetry .",
    "in addition , we present a dual interpretation in which electrons in a cubic crystal with intrinsic orbital degrees of freedom spontaneously develop orbital order .    _",
    "( ii ) _ within the framework of the symmetry classification , we identify two distinct spin - orbit coupled cubic crystal @xmath5-phases , which are in correspondence with what we call scalar @xmath0-point density wave orders .",
    "they are scalar orders in the sense that they can be viewed as total angular momentum @xmath23 terms .",
    "the first originates from the set of charge density or @xmath10 waves and corresponds to a full spin - rotation symmetry broken spin density wave state , the so - called chiral spin density wave  @xcite , associated with a gapped mean - field spectrum .",
    "the mean - field ground state is a chern insulator .",
    "the second is a time - reversal invariant triplet @xmath11-wave or spin - current state , breaking no symmetries other than spin - rotation symmetry .",
    "we show that the mean - field ground state is a symmetry - protected @xmath24 dirac semimetal  @xcite , protected by symmetries closely related to non - symmorphic crystal symmetry , and sits at the boundary between a trivial and a topological insulator . using simple symmetry arguments ,",
    "we discuss how symmetry breaking perturbations can drive the dirac semimetal into either a trivial or topological electronic state . as such , the scalar ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) triplet @xmath11-wave state realizes a novel electronic phase , the dynamically generated 2d dirac semimetal .    _",
    "( iii ) _ the symmetry classification of triplet @xmath0-point order can be used to obtain the symmetric spin states of a given ( hexagonal ) lattice .",
    "symmetric spin states are classical spin states that respect all symmetries of the crystal lattice up to a global rotation of all spins  @xcite .",
    "such states are relevant in the context of magnetic materials , i.e. , systems described by pure spin model hamiltonians , as well as materials in which itinerant carriers are coupled to ( large ) localized spins",
    ". we will demonstrate that the symmetry classification provides a straightforward and constructive derivation of symmetric spin states . to summarize the organization of the paper , sec .",
    "[ sec : betaphase ] will introduce dynamically generated spin - orbit coupling . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tripletm ] , triplet @xmath0-point order is considered , by first discussing nesting instabilities and then proceeding to introduce the mapping from hexagonal to cubic symmetry . using the mapping to define the symmetry classification , we identify and study two types of scalar triplet density wave states .",

    "[ sec : classical ] , we point out the connection to classical spin liquid states , and finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize and discuss the results presented .",
    "in case of hexagonal @xmath25 symmetry , the @xmath11-wave channel is two - fold degenerate , with the @xmath11-wave orbitals @xmath26 transforming as partners of a two - dimensional representation .",
    "therefore , if the leading instability is in the @xmath2 @xmath11-wave channel , a general linear combination of the two @xmath11-wave orbitals is allowed .",
    "this situation has been shown to occur for the triangular and honeycomb lattices electrons at van hove doping , when nesting is weak  @xcite . in the singlet channel",
    "only real superpositions of the two degenerate orbitals are allowed . in the triplet channel , however , both real and complex or `` chiral '' linear combinations are possible .    in the triplet channel , real and chiral linear combinations of the @xmath11 waves are lattice analogs of the @xmath6 and @xmath5",
    "electronic liquid crystal phases with dynamically generated `` spin - orbit coupling '' in continuum fermi liquids  @xcite .",
    "both in the @xmath6 and @xmath5 phases spin - rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken . in the @xmath6",
    "phase the spin order is uniaxial and spin rotation is only partially broken .",
    "spatial rotations are broken due to @xmath11-wave nature of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "in contrast , spin - rotation symmetry is fully broken in the @xmath5 phase , yet the @xmath5 phase is isotropic due to the coupling of spin and orbital angular momentum : combined spin and spatial rotations leave the state invariant",
    ". the isotropy can be thought of as a consequence of two angular momenta adding to form a rotationally invariant singlet state .",
    "let us show this more explicitly .",
    "we collect the two @xmath11-wave orbitals in a vector @xmath27 ( explicit expressions of lattice form factors can be found in table  [ tab : trifunctions ] of appendix  [ app : gt ] ) and then write the @xmath6 phase as @xmath28 the two - component order parameter @xmath29 is real , which follows from the requirement of hermiticity . as a result , @xmath29 is a nematic order parameter breaking lattice rotational symmetry  @xcite . due to the uniaxial spin polarization along the @xmath30 axis ,",

    "are locked together in such a way that ( properly chosen ) simultaneous rotations make the @xmath5 phase isotropic .    as a spoiler for the next section",
    ", the coupling of @xmath11-waves and spin in the @xmath5-phase can be obtained more formally by the standard recipe for addition of angular momenta in a crystal . in hexagonal symmetry",
    "the @xmath11-waves transform as the nematic doublet @xmath34 , and the spin components @xmath35 as the vector doublet @xmath36 .",
    "addition of angular momenta is then given by @xmath37 .",
    "the first two terms are scalars , @xmath31 and @xmath38 , which both correspond to isotropic @xmath5-phases .",
    "it should be noted that even though the @xmath6 phase is non - chiral whereas the @xmath5 phase is chiral , both break time - reversal symmetry since both are triplet @xmath11-wave states .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that unitary rotations in spin space will yield equivalent states in case of both types of phases , since the normal state is spin - rotation invariant .",
    "when the dominant instability is in the @xmath2 @xmath11-wave particle - hole channel , it was shown that the chiral @xmath14 @xmath5-phase is favored  @xcite .",
    "this result mirrors the result found in the cooper channel , in which case chiral @xmath14 superconductivity is favored  @xcite .",
    "these findings are rooted in hexagonal symmetry and therefore apply to both the triangular and honeycomb lattices .",
    "an expression similar to eq .  , taking the sublattice structure into account , can be written for the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we summarize this section by noting that hexagonal @xmath2 triplet states are examples of dynamically generated spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in particular , the @xmath5-phase of eq .   is a spin - orbit coupled scalar , analogous to total angular momentum @xmath39 states arising from addition of two angular momenta @xmath40 and @xmath21 .",
    "particle - hole condensation at finite wave vector is expected when the fermi surface is strongly or perfectly nested by that wave vector . for hexagonal lattices such as the triangular and honeycomb lattices ,",
    "fermi surface nesting can occur at three inequivalent wave vectors @xmath41 . in this section , we study triplet density waves of hexagonal lattices with commensurate ordering vectors @xmath41 having the general form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the triplet version of the singlet term @xmath44 ( suppressing sublattice indices ) . as a first step towards this goal ,",
    "we derive all distinct nesting instabilities using a simple algebraic approach .",
    "we establish the symmetry of the nesting instabilities using extended point group representations .",
    "based on that we define a symmetry classification of triplet nesting instabilities in terms of spin - orbit coupling , in close analogy with the spin - orbit coupled @xmath2 phases . to this end , we introduce a mapping from hexagonal symmetry to cubic symmetry .",
    "we then analyze a specific class of spin - orbit coupled orders , the total angular momentum @xmath23 orders , in more detail .",
    "the analysis of hexagonal lattice nesting instabilities in the presence of spin is a straightforward extension of the analysis without spin degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the goal is to construct an algebra of the van hove electrons and use that algebra to determine the nesting instabilities . for lattices with hexagonal symmetry , the three van hove singularities are located at the inequivalent @xmath0-point momenta @xmath41 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bzhexa ] .",
    "the algebra of the @xmath0-point electrons can be expressed in terms of the van hove electron operators @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 labels the spin .",
    "the full hexagonal van hove algebra is then defined by the bilinears @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the set of gell - mann matrices , i.e. , the generators of su(3 ) ( we also include the identity matrix ) , and @xmath50 are pauli matrices [ generators of su(2 ) ] which act on the electron spin .",
    "the matrices @xmath49 act on the species index @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "the explicit form of the set of eight @xmath49 is given in appendix  [ app : malgebra ] .",

    "sub - algebras , each of which acts in the subspace of a pair of van hove electrons . in this way",
    "the sub - algebras are associated with the three ways of connecting two @xmath0-points , i.e. , coupling the van hove electrons .",
    "for instance , the pair of van hove electrons @xmath55 and @xmath56 is connected by wave vector @xmath57 .",
    "the su(2 ) algebra specified by @xmath58 acts in the subspace @xmath59 and governs the nesting instabilities at wave vector @xmath57 .",
    "the matrix @xmath60 is diagonal and describes the population imbalance of van hove electrons @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "all bilinears that do not commute with @xmath63 give rise to nesting instabilities .",
    "the non - commuting set of matrices is given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , corresponding to charge and spin density waves , respectively , in addition to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which correspond to charge currents and spin currents .",
    "nesting instabilities at the wave vectors @xmath68 and @xmath69 are obtained by either explicitly constructing the van hove sub - algebras of the doublets @xmath70 and @xmath71 , or more directly by using rotational symmetry .",
    "one finds that the bilinears specified by the matrices @xmath52 correspond to three degenerate charge density wave instabilities at the three different wave vectors , whereas the set @xmath53 corresponds to three degenerate charge - current density waves . in the spin channel ,",
    "the set @xmath72 describes spin density waves and the set @xmath73 describes spin - current density waves .",
    "( left ) brillouin zone ( bz ) of hexagonal lattices with special @xmath0-point momenta @xmath41 .",
    "red hexagon represents the fermi surface at van hove filling ; small black hexagon is the folded bz of the quadrupled unit cell .",
    "( right ) folded bz and high symmetry @xmath74-points ; red line segments are the folded fermi surface .",
    "dashed lines are the unfolded bz ( black ) and fermi surface ( red ) . ]",
    "let us consider the symmetry properties of the nesting instabilities .",
    "charge density wave order given by @xmath52 respects time - reversal symmetry while orbital current order @xmath53 is odd under time reversal . since spin is odd under timereversal , the triplet orders @xmath72 ( spin density waves ) and @xmath73 ( spin - current density waves ) are odd and even under time reversal , respectively .",
    "as far as spatial symmetries are concerned , the components of @xmath52 transform as the representation @xmath75 of the extended point group @xmath19 , and the components of @xmath53 as @xmath76 ( see also appendix  [ app : gt ] ) .",
    "the @xmath75 representation describes @xmath10-wave form factors at each wave vector and the @xmath76 representation describes @xmath11-wave form factors , so we may use these symmetry labels to refer to charge and orbital current order ( see also table  [ tab : correspond ] ) .",
    "in particular , we refer to @xmath72 as triplet @xmath10-wave or triplet @xmath75 order , and similarly for @xmath73 . we assume absence of spin - orbit coupling in the normal state leading to a full su(2 ) rotation symmetry in spin space .",

    "this requires studying the action of symmetries of the hexagonal lattice on the density waves in more detail . to proceed ,",
    "we therefore explore the properties of the @xmath0-point representation of hexagonal symmetry .",

    "it is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 labels the sites of the triangular bravais lattice .",

    "here , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we define the action of the group generators @xmath87 and @xmath88 on @xmath79 as @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , which are given by @xmath91 ( more details in appendix  [ app : malgebra ] ) .",
    "all matrices @xmath92 are diagonal , an example is @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath94 matrices @xmath92 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 generate a representation of the extended hexagonal point group @xmath19 .",
    "a general modulation of electron density with @xmath0-point propagation vectors can be written as a linear combination of the three components of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is an arbitrary vector . except for certain special cases",
    ", such linear combinations will not respect lattice symmetries .",
    "this is certainly true for the translations : @xmath100 for at least one @xmath92 and general @xmath99 .",
    "when spin is taken into account , however , a more careful consideration of the symmetries of @xmath0-point order is required .",
    "we now demonstrate this based on the simplest case of @xmath0-point modulations described by single @xmath99 [ i.e. , @xmath98 ] , hence avoiding unessential details such as sublattice structure .",
    "general modulations of spin density , with spin represented by the pauli matrices @xmath102 , are written in terms of a matrix @xmath103 as @xmath104 this can be thought of as a vector @xmath99 for each spin direction .",
    "the effect of a translation is then expressed as @xmath105 , where the @xmath92 act on @xmath103 from the right .",
    "note that matrices acting from the right act on the @xmath0-point indices @xmath51 , whereas matrices acting from the left of @xmath103 act on the spin indices @xmath106 ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) . due to the spin degree of freedom",
    ", it can occur that in some cases multiplication by @xmath92 from the right is equal to multiplication by some @xmath94 matrix @xmath108 from the left , @xmath109 in this way , the action of translations is carried over to spin space , since @xmath108 is a global spin - rotation matrix .",
    "a trivial example of this is the identity matrix , i.e. @xmath110 , in which case @xmath111  @xcite .    the key implication of the relation @xmath112 is the equivalence of translations and spin rotations .",
    "specifically , it implies that the term @xmath113 ( with @xmath114 ) can be made invariant under translations with the help of a unitary matrix @xmath115 su(2 ) associated with @xmath116 , expressed as @xmath117 the unitary matrix @xmath118 acts on the matrix components of the @xmath50 , and through the correspondence with @xmath116 implements the global spin rotation .",
    "hence , even though @xmath0-point modulations would seem to break translational symmetry , in certain cases ( for certain @xmath103 ) they are invariant up to global spin rotation  @xcite .",
    "the significance of these global spin rotations is the resulting invariance of the hamiltonian @xmath119 .",
    "a translation combined with a global spin rotation leaves the hamiltonian invariant and this effective symmetry will lead to degeneracies of the spectrum .",
    "the same argument applies to the point group generators @xmath87 and @xmath88 , in which case the global spin rotation matrices are denoted as @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is important , however , to distinguish proper and improper @xmath116 , since one can only associate an su(2 ) matrix to a proper @xmath116 .",
    "improper rotations acquire an extra minus sign , i.e. , @xmath122 , as a consequence of inversion . again taking the simplest case @xmath110 as an example",
    ", it is easy to see that all reflections , which are composed of @xmath96 , are improper . as a result , @xmath0-point spin density modulations of the form",
    "@xmath123 are odd under reflections .",
    "the expression @xmath113 in   bears a suggestive resemblance to the familiar spin - orbit coupling term @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is spin and @xmath126 is orbital angular momentum .",
    "indeed , as is clear from the preceding discussion , @xmath127 implies an entangling of spatial symmetries and spin .",
    "we now show how this resemblance can be formalized by exploiting the mapping between the extended hexagonal point group @xmath19 and the cubic group @xmath18 .",
    "we then explain",
    "how such mapping provides a way to classify and determine the symmetry of triplet @xmath0-point density wave orders .",
    "we start by explicitly constructing the mapping from the group @xmath19 to the cubic group @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to see that the matrices @xmath92 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , associated with the generators of @xmath19 , are @xmath94 rotation matrices .",
    "the key observation is that they correspond to rotations that leave a cube invariant .",
    "for instance , the matrices @xmath92 are two - fold rotation about the principal axes , and @xmath95 is a three - fold rotation about the body diagonal . as a result , the @xmath0-point representation also realizes a representation of @xmath18 .",
    "this is , however , not a faithful representation , since the two - fold rotation @xmath128 in @xmath19 is represented by the identity , i.e. , @xmath129 .",
    "a faithful representation is obtained by redefining the generator matrix of @xmath87 as @xmath130 . in this way",
    ", the twofold rotation in @xmath19 is mapped to the inversion in @xmath18 : @xmath131 .",
    "this establishes a one - to - one correspondence between elements of @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , the representations of the two groups and their basis functions are in one - to - one correspondence . for instance , the cubic representation generated by @xmath132 is given by @xmath133 symmetry , and it is simple to check that the representation generated by @xmath134 is @xmath135 .",
    "the three - component nature of representations of @xmath19 is rooted in nonzero ( @xmath0-point ) linear momenta , whereas the three - component nature of @xmath18 representations is due to nonzero _ angular _ momenta .",
    "angular momentum orbitals with @xmath133 and @xmath135 symmetry are given by @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "another way of stating it is that particle - hole pairs with finite momentum in 2d can be uniquely associated with particle - hole pairs with nonzero angular momentum in 3d .",
    "the latter belong to the class of liquid crystal phases . what is the implication of this correspondence ? to answer that question , we first relate the @xmath19 representations @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which describe the symmetry of the charge and charge - current density waves , to representations of the cubic group .",
