    "the venerable idea that nuclear forces are due to pion exchanges indicates that processes involving different number of nucleons are related , owing to the common presence of some basic subamplitudes describing either single ( @xmath1 ) or multipion ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , ... ) interactions . as the latter class encompasses free cases , relationships with scattering data",
    "are also possible . nowadays",
    ", this web of interconnections can be explored consistently by means of effective chiral lagrangians , in which just pions and nucleons are treated as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "the rationale for this approach is that the quarks @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which have small masses , dominate low - energy interactions .",
    "one then works with a two - flavor version of qcd and treats these masses as perturbations in a chiral symmetric lagrangian .",
    "quark mass contributions are included systematically by means of a chiral perturbation theory @xmath7 , which allows the relevant dynamical features of qcd to be properly incorporated into the nuclear force problem .",
    "kinematical constraints imposed over a given subamplitude by the number of nucleons present in the system are automatically taken into account by the use of field theory techniques .    in order to perform chiral expansions ,",
    "one uses a typical scale @xmath8 , set by either pion four - momenta or nucleon three - momenta , such that @xmath9 gev .",
    "as far as the nuclear force problem is concerned , one notes that the free @xmath10 amplitude begins at @xmath11 and two chiral expansions up to @xmath0 are presently available .",
    "one of them employs the so called heavy baryon approximation@xcite , whereas the other one is fully covariant@xcite . in the case of the @xmath12 potential",
    ", the @xmath13 provides the leading contribution , which begins@xcite at @xmath14 .",
    "the more complex two - pion exchange potential @xmath15 begins at @xmath16 and there are two independent expansions up to @xmath17 in the literature , based on either heavy baryon@xcite or covariant@xcite chpt .",
    "the leading contribution to the three - nucleon force is associated with two - pion exchange and begins at @xmath18 .",
    "quite generally , asymptotic ( large @xmath19 ) expressions for the various potentials have the status of theorems and can be written in the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the leading order .",
    "this structure in terms chiral layers has little model dependence .",
    "in the last fifteen years , the systematic use of chiral symmetry led to a considerable improvement in the understanding of @xmath22 dynamics . here",
    "we briefly describe the problem , in a perspective biased by the work done by our group@xcite . at @xmath0 , the dynamical content of the @xmath22",
    "is given by three families of diagrams , shown in the figure below .",
    "family i corresponds to the minimal realization of chiral symmetry and begins at @xmath23 , whereas family ii is @xmath0 and associated with pion - pion correlations .",
    "both of them depend only on the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "family iii begins at @xmath18 and depends on low energy constants ( lecs , represented by the black dots ) , which can be extracted from either @xmath26 or @xmath27 scattering data . in the latter case ,",
    "the calculated @xmath22 becomes a theoretical prediction .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the figures above display the profile functions for the drift and spin - orbit potentials derived from our @xmath0 expansion of the @xmath22 .",
    "they do not include short range effects and can not be trusted for @xmath28fm .",
    "as far as chiral symmetry is concerned , drift corrections begin at @xmath0 and , in principle , should be smaller than the spin - orbit terms , which begin at @xmath18 .",
    "however , in the isospin even channel , this chiral hierarchy is not respected and one may expect important drift effects .",
    "finally , it is important to stress that the origin of drift effects is kinematical , and not dynamical .",
    "the leading term in the three - nucleon potential has the longest possible range and corresponds to the process known as @xmath29 , in which a pion emitted by one of the nucleons is scattered by a second one , before being absorbed by the third nucleon .",
    "it is closely related to the @xmath10 scattering amplitude , which is @xmath11 for free pions and becomes @xmath23 within the three - nucleon system . as a consequence ,",
    "the three - body force begins at @xmath18 .",
    "this leading component has been available since long@xcite .",
    "the extension of the chiral series to @xmath0 requires the inclusion of single loop effects and is associated with a large number of diagrams . here",
    ", we concentrate on the particular set of processes which belong to the @xmath29 class .    quite generally , the connected part of the non - relativistic two - pion exchange amplitude can be written as        where @xmath24 and @xmath30 represent the axial nucleon and pion decay constants .",
    "the subamplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32 carry the dynamical content of the @xmath10 interaction and receive contributions from both tree diagrams and loops .",
    "their chiral content has been discussed , in covariant chpt , by becher and leutwyler@xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath33 corresponds to a configuration space potential of the form    v_3 ( , ) = ^(1)^(2 ) v_3^+ ( , ) + ^(1)^(2 ) ^(3 ) v_3 ^ - ( , ) + .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath0 contributions gives rise to both numerical corrections in pre - existing strength coefficients @xmath34 and new structures in the profile functions .",
    "schematically , one has@xcite    v_3^+ ( , ) & = & c_1^+ + c_2^+ + c_3^+ , + v_3 ^ - ( , ) & = & c_1 ^ - + c_2 ^ - + & + & c_3 ^ - .    in this result ,",
    "the loop functions are given by fourier transforms of pion propagators multiplying feynman integrals and the non - local terms are linear in gradients acting on the wave function .",
    "the strength coefficients of the potential depend on well determined parameters @xmath35 , on the value of the scalar form factor at the cheng - dashen point ( @xmath36 ) and on the lecs @xmath37 and @xmath38 . adopting @xmath39 mev and extracting the lecs from the @xmath10 subthreshold coefficients @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41 , one finds the results quoted in the table below .",
    "@xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + @xmath46 & 0.794 & -2.118 & 0.011 & 0.691 & -0.025 & 0.021 + brazil @xcite & 0.920 & -1.99 & - & 0.67 & - & - +    [ t2 ]    the relatively small changes in these parameters are due to the use of chpt . at",
    "the chiral order one is working here , new effects associated with both non - local interactions and loop effects begin to show up .",
    "they correspond to the terms proportional to the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the systematic application of chiral symmetry to the study of nuclear forces gives rise to a picture in which the various effects begin to appear at different orders .",
    "this is indicated in the table below , which also includes the drift potential .",
    "the chiral series has been tested , by assessing the relative importance of @xmath16 , @xmath54 and @xmath17 terms in each component of the @xmath22@xcite .",
    "one finds satisfactory convergence at distances of physical interest , except for @xmath55 , where the ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath18 contributions is larger than @xmath56 for distances smaller than @xmath57 fm .",
    "chiral perturbation theory also predicts relative sizes for the various dynamical effects .",
    "for instance , it allows one to expect that @xmath58 should be larger than @xmath55 , since these terms begin respectively at @xmath23 and @xmath18 .",
    "empirical data defy this expectation and , in the figures of section 2 , it is possible to note that @xmath55 is about 10 times larger than @xmath58 at @xmath57 fm",
    ". the same pattern is followed by the drift potential , which begins at @xmath0 and , in principle , should be smaller than the spin - orbit terms , which begin at @xmath18 .",
    "however , in the isospin even channel , the same dynamical contribution that operates in the central potential subverts the expected chiral hierarchy , as shown in the figures of section 3 .",
    "the enhancement of some interactions in the isoscalar sector is a puzzling aspect of the chiral picture .",
    "the numerical reasons for this behavior can be traced back to the large sizes of some of the lecs used in the calculation , which are dynamically generated by processes involving delta intermediate states .",
    "therefore the explicit inclusion of delta degrees of freedom in a covariant calculation could shed light into this problem . on the other hand",
    ", one should also bear in mind that the very use of perturbation theory may not be suited to describe isoscalar interactions in regions of physical interest .",
    "this is suggested by the study of the nucleon scalar form factor@xcite , which is closely related with the central @xmath12 interaction .",
    "it indicates that the chiral angle is not small around the nucleon and the expected chiral hierarchy between nucleon and delta contributions is already subverted around 1.2 fm .",
