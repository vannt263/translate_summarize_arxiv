    "in many important objects atomic hydrogen h is produced by dissociation processes from diatomic hydrogen h@xmath0 or other hydrogen - containing molecules like h@xmath0o , h@xmath0s or nh@xmath2 .",
    "examples are comet comas  @xcite , jupiter s atmosphere  @xcite and photodissociation regions ( pdr )  @xcite but the direct dissociation of h@xmath0 by electron impact is important also in shocks as an effect of preheating electrons , and in more general terms , in all non equilibrium plasmas produced in h@xmath0 where the electron temperature is much higher than the gas temperature , a situation than can be produced by electric fields and is easily reproduced in discharge plasmas .",
    "atoms produced from dissociation reactions are often superthermal , or hot atoms , since they gain energy by sliding down a repulsive adiabatic potential to the dissociation limit .",
    "hot atoms are also produced from symmetric charge exchange reactions , i.e. h@xmath3 + h @xmath1 h@xmath4 + h@xmath5 of h atoms with fast ions of different origins .",
    "the average energy of such atoms is a few @xmath6 .",
    "the chemistry of such h atoms is therefore a non thermal chemistry , since the usual assumption of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the kinetic energy of h atoms can not be held to relate the average thermal energy and the rate coefficients of collisional processes .",
    "the production and reactions of superthermal h atoms is a topic of great astrophysical relevance .",
    "many chemical reactions involving h atoms and important for interstellar chemical networks have a threshold which can be overcome by the availability of extra kinetic energy .",
    "examples are the trapping of h atoms in solid hydrogen  @xcite , the hydrogen abstraction from several molecules like h@xmath0o , h@xmath0s , hydrocarbons and their deuterated versions  @xcite , the impact ionization of i group metals  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to develop practical and reliable methods to characterize the chemical reactivity of h atoms after their production including the effects due to their moderation , thermalization and loss in impact and reactions with other species .",
    "this problem can be tackled by using a continuum slowing down approximation similar to the fermi theory  @xcite , but a much better method is to apply the rigorous thermalization theory developed for the case of neutron kinetics in gaseous moderators  @xcite .",
    "while the resulting integral equations are very complex , a simpler approach to obtain rigorous numerical results is provided by the application of a monte carlo ( mc ) method that takes into account the thermal distribution of target particles in the collision kernel and the energy dependence of the cross section .    in this paper some calculations of the translational relaxation and chemical reactivity of superthermal h in h@xmath0 are presented , with a cross section determined from the inversion of transport data . an accurate mc model for thermal particle transport developed in the past in our group and already validated",
    "is applied to this problem .",
    "the appropriate parameter set is individuated .",
    "results are discussed in the light of several important astrophysical reactions .",
    "calculations are performed using the mc method for particle transport in a thermal background described by longo & diomede ( 2009 ) and by panarese et al .",
    "this method has been recently validated by comparing the calculated values of binary diffusion coefficients in different gases with calculations based on the chapman - enskog development extended to high orders  @xcite .    although the method is described in the above references , here a self - consistent short description is provided .",
    "the starting point is the expression of the real collision frequency for a h particle moving with velocity v , given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the velocity distribution function of target particles and @xmath9 is the collision pair frequency defined as @xmath10 @xmath11 is the total cross section , @xmath12 is the relative speed of the collision pair and @xmath13 is the target particle density .",
    "the method is based on the preliminary selection of a maximum value for the product @xmath14 denoted by @xmath15 . by replacing @xmath14 with @xmath15 in the integral expression ( [ eqnuno ] )",
    "this last can be rewritten into the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 this replacement implies a potentially non - physical increase of the collision frequency , which can be compensated by using the concept of null - collision , i.e. the inclusion of artificial scattering events which accounts for the difference @xmath18 but has no effect on the motion of h atoms .",
    "this solution allows an exact simple treatment of collisions in a test particle monte carlo ( tpmc ) model .",
    "this numerical method describes the motion of test particles diluted in a bulk medium of target particles .    in our case ,",
    "the system is constituted by test particles of h moving in a h@xmath0 uniform bulk , in equilibrium at temperature @xmath19 and pressure @xmath20 .",
    "initially test particles are put in the origin of a three - dimensional space and are let to diffuse across the bulk .",
    "test particles are initialized with the same energy and interact with bulk particles by means of binary collisions .    for each collision",
    ", the bulk particle velocity is selected according to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution at the temperature @xmath19 , using a direct method of sampling . for this purpose , setting @xmath21 as the velocity component along the i - direction , a pair of values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is sampled from @xmath24 and @xmath25 , using two random numbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 uniformly distributed between @xmath28 and @xmath29 . finally the value of the i - component of the thermal velocity in the equilibrium bulk is sampled as @xmath30 .    in order to remove the extra collision events used to equalize the collision frequency to @xmath31 , a further random number @xmath32",
    "is compared to the fraction of real collisions given by @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath32 is smaller than this quantity , the collision is effective .",
    "after an effective collision , the relative velocity vector must be rotated according to two polar angles , namely @xmath23 , the scattering angle , and @xmath34 , the azimuthal angle .",
    "this last is uniformly sampled in the interval [ 0,2@xmath35 , while the selection of @xmath23 depends on the interaction model .",
    "once the scattering angle is known , the scattering is treated taking into account the correlation with the old particle velocity using euler angles : the relative velocity vector after the collision , @xmath36 , is calculated as @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 as above is the relative velocity before the collision .",
    "@xmath23 is determined from a quadrature of the interaction potential @xmath42 based on the known value of the impact parameter @xmath43 @xmath44^{-1/2 } \\frac{dr}{r^2}=\\pi - \\chi(b , e),\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the distance of closest approach .",
    "the value of @xmath43 is obtained from @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is simply given by @xmath48 . in case of isotropic elastic scattering , @xmath49 .",
    "the motion of the colliding particle of mass @xmath50 relative to the bulk target particle of mass @xmath51 is equivalent to the motion of a particle of mass @xmath52 relative to a centre of force .",
    "the collision energy is calculated as a function of the relative speed @xmath53 of the interacting pair by @xmath54 .    as in a binary interaction",
    "the centre of mass velocity is a constant , the velocity of the colliding particle after the collision is given by @xmath55    the time difference between one collision ( including null collisions ) and the next one is given by the formula @xmath56 where @xmath57 is again a random number from a uniform distribution , @xmath58 .",
    "this time is inversely proportional to the gas density .",
    "an appropriate parameter to measure the degree of thermalization of a h atom in the bulk medium is therefore provided by the product @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the average lifetime of a h atom before its chemical or diffusion loss .",
    "calculations performed using different values of @xmath61 and @xmath60 , but leaving the value of the product @xmath59 unchanged , produce the same results .",
    "the finite lifetime @xmath60 is obtained in the simulation by removing the injected particles with a probability @xmath62 before each collision .",
    "the removed particle is labelled in such a way that the computer simulation is not accounting for it anymore .",
    "the simulation proceeds until all particles are removed .",
    "this procedure is exact when @xmath60 is not dependent on the atom speed and can be used when this approximation is considered feasible . in specific cases",
    "@xmath60 will be determined by the chemical network assumed . in molecular clouds , collisional loss reactions with h@xmath63 and h@xmath64 and other species",
    "can be important , while in the laboratory h atoms are often lost in reactions with purposely added scavengers uncommon in space , e.g. iodine atoms .",
    "for these collisional losses @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the appropriate rate coefficient while n@xmath67 is the number density of the corresponding reaction partner .",
    "the photoionization or the radiation ionization of h atoms are well described by a constant @xmath60 as well .",
    "heterogeneous recombination on reactor walls in the laboratory and on dust grains in space can be treated similarly , but the formula must account for diffusion times . in case",
    "@xmath60 has a strong dependence on the h atom speed or if a loss cross section @xmath68 is used instead of a loss rate coefficient , the removal process can be improved . for any collision a candidate collision partner for any loss channel is sampled from a maxwell distribution . the probability that a collision results in h atom loss is @xmath69 and the loss channel is selected if @xmath70 .",
    "collision events are sampled on a uniform grid on an axis representing the variable @xmath71 . in this way",
    "the quantity sampled is the collision density @xmath72 .",
    "this quantity is normalized to one atom produced per unit time .",
    "the role of hot atoms in chemical reactions is well known as mentioned in the introduction . with",
    "the extra energy provided , these atoms can increase considerably , sometimes by orders of magnitudes , the rate of chemical reactions in which they are involved .",
    "there are two ways in which the non equilibrium translational kinetics of h atoms can be described , as a result of calculations by the method described in the previous section .",
    "one possibility is to calculate the so - called collision density , or equivalently the energy distribution .",
    "the second one is to calculate the rate coefficients of relevant reactions with trace species present in the bulk gas ( h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the collision density @xmath73 is defined in such a way that the number of collisions of each atom in the energy range @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 .",
    "the knowledge of this function allows to calculate any collisional rate once the probability @xmath76 of accessing the i - th channel is known .",
    "alternatively , the usual kinetic distribution @xmath77 can be calculated , if relevant , by the expression @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the collision frequency for test particles of speed @xmath80 reported at the beginning of the previous section .",
    "the collision density has been the subject of classical theoretical treatments ( see also below ) but in the case of slightly superthermal particles decelerated until thermal energy ( thermalization ) , which is relevant here , a full numerical approach is more appropriate .",
    "the collision density has been the subject of stochastic calculations , beginning from rebick & dubrin ( 1970 ) . in their work",
    "the authors provide the first results for h atoms in xe , a diluent selected in view of the high molar mass and relative chemical inertness .",
    "they neglected the effect of the target speed in some steps of the calculations , which is a quite acceptable approximation for their test case where the mass ratio is very high , but not appropriate for h in h@xmath0 .",
    "the collision frequency and dynamics is exactly accounted using the method of this paper .",
    "calculated using data by stallcop et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and using the model cross section in the text . ]    in order to calculate the frequency of h - h@xmath0 collisions a reliable momentum transfer cross section is necessary .",
    "such cross section can be evaluated by fitting the binary diffusion coefficient d of h atoms in h@xmath0 gas at different temperatures .",
    "this last is calculated using the collision integrals reported by stallcop et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and based on an accurate interaction potential .",
    "the mc method described in the work by panarese et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is used to obtain d as a function of @xmath19 from a guessed cross section of the form @xmath81 with @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "the best fit ( fig .",
    "[ d ] ) is obtained for @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this values are used in the subsequent calculations of h thermalization .",
    "[ d ] is cut at t@xmath87 k , since above this temperature , the equilibrium dissociation of h@xmath0 at 1atm can not be neglected . however , the comparison of the two values of the formal quantity d(t@xmath88 ) at higher t@xmath88 is still meaningful as a check of our simplified cross section at high energy .",
    "these two values are actually very close also at t@xmath89 k.    the numerical parameters revelant to specify the thermalization regime in our problems are : the initial h energy @xmath90 , the gas temperature @xmath19 , the gas density @xmath61 and the average lifetime of h atoms in the gas , @xmath60 .",
    "this last parameter describes the effect of processes which remove h atoms from the gas .",
    "this process can be e.g. the photoionization of h atoms . in this and similar cases @xmath60",
    "is defined as usual through the photochemical expression @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the chemical loss rate of h atoms .    in order to reduce the number of parameters , in this study @xmath90",
    "is fixed to @xmath93 .",
    "this value is compatible with direct dissociation from the @xmath94 ground state to the triplet state correlated to h(1s ) + h(1s ) and provides an important example .",
    "this choice of a delta function for the energy distribution of the source can be extended to more complex cases by simple statistical sampling of the more involved source function .",
    "= 1k , t@xmath88=20k and t@xmath88=100k .",
    "the placzek function , characterized by a discontinuity for @xmath95=@xmath90/9 , is evident .",
    "the singular contribution at @xmath96 ( see text ) is not represented . ]    the collision density in case of h atoms originated with a single energy is characterized by a singular contribution corresponding to the first collision of h with h@xmath0 with a h energy by necessity equal to @xmath90 .",
    "a finite amplitude for @xmath97 could be obtained by selecting the initial energy from a gaussian like in the work by prisant et al .",
    "( 1978 ) . following the custom for @xmath97 plots in nuclear applications  @xcite this contribution have not represented .",
    "results for @xmath97 are better discussed in the light of the semi - analytical theory of placzek ( 1946 ) , based on a iterative solution of a simplified integral equation , which is obtained for @xmath97 in the limit of zero gas temperature and for rigid sphere elastic scattering .",
    "it is important to note that stochastic approaches allow to remove both limitations of placzek equation .",
    "nevertheless , the solution of this equation allows to establish three important general features which are approximately valid also for @xmath98 :    1 .   in the so called asymptotic region far below @xmath90 but close to the bulk thermal energy , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the average logarithmic energy loss for single collision . for h in h@xmath0 , this means @xmath101 .",
    "2 .   very close to the source energy @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath97 is given by a simple expression as a function of the mass ratio @xmath102 here , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "a discontinuity is present in the function at @xmath104 associated to the lowest energy value of the initial redistribution by the first collision .",
    "in fact , the maximum loss for the h energy corresponds to a head - on collision with an h@xmath0 at rest : in this case the final h speed is equal to @xmath105 the initial h speed .",
    "such features are confirmed by our calculations for different values of @xmath19 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ unk ] . in this case",
    "the particles were removed when moderated below @xmath106 in order to avoid any interference in the moderation kinetics .",
    "this choice produces a non - exponential loss of the particles during moderation .    in fig .",
    "[ centok ] the collision density corresponding to @xmath107 and different @xmath60 is reported .",
    "the equilibrium result is also reported for reference .",
    "the plots illustrate the role and effects of the two fundamental parameters @xmath108 and @xmath19 on the calculated collision density .",
    "@xmath109 is the characteristic collision time .",
    "an estimate of @xmath110 for a typical ism density of 10@xmath111 @xmath112 leads to @xmath113s .",
    "a superthermal tail is associated to the slowing down of freshly produced h atoms , whose distribution shape is affected by @xmath19 and the shape of @xmath114 but essentially corresponds to the placzek solution for @xmath115 .",
    "the low energy component of @xmath97 is essentially determined by the equilibrium contribution , the relative importance of the two being controlled by the parameter @xmath108 . even at energies much higher than those corresponding to the maxwellian bulk , in the tail region , the thermal distribution of molecules can not be neglected .",
    "this has the effect of smearing the placzek peak of fig .",
    "[ unk ] which does not appear anymore as a salient feature at temperatures higher than a few 10 s k even for rigid sphere scattering . only detailed calculations can then establish accurately the tail shape .",
    "= 100k for various values of @xmath108 . the singular contribution at @xmath96 ( see text ) is not represented . ]",
    "the presence of the superthermal tail is expected to limit the validity of the traditional chemical kinetics of astrophysical objects and phenomena in several ways .",
    "for example , the rate coefficient of a reactive process involving h atoms will not be given by the equilibrium formula based on the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , but a superthermal contribution to the rate coefficients will need to be accounted for , i.e. @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "this last contribution @xmath117 can be determined in specific cases by running a mc simulation based on the prescriptions provided in this paper .",
    "details differ depending on the gas temperature and the threshold of the reaction . for reactions with no threshold ( where effects are still possible due to cross section shape or resonances ) or a threshold comparable to the thermal energy , the rate coefficient can be corrected by the modification of the translational distribution which is not described by a maxwell - boltzmann law .",
    "the expression of the rate coefficient k@xmath118 for a process p , whose related cross section is @xmath119 , is a functional of the h translational distribution @xmath120 where f@xmath121 is the distribution of impact energy in the c.m .",
    "frame . in the equilibrium case",
    "f@xmath121 is a maxwellian distribution with m replaced by @xmath122 and k@xmath118 is a function of t@xmath88 . when a superthermal component is present ,",
    "this equation is still valid but k@xmath118 can not be written as a function of the gas temperature .",
    "examples of reactions which may be reconsidered in this light are the radiative association reactions of h with c@xmath5  @xcite and h@xmath5  @xcite which are of importance for the interstellar medium and for the early universe chemistry respectively .",
    "superthermal atoms can also affect the cooling function of the gas , due to the strong energy dependence of the collisional deexcitation coefficients , i.e. the rate constants of the reactions h+h@xmath123",
    "h+h@xmath124  @xcite .",
    "the complex thermalization of h atoms will also affect preheating in strong shocks in hydrogen .",
    "the atomic component is more mobile than the bulk gas because of the much higher diffusion coefficient , and can contribute to affect the shock profile .",
    "a similar effect has been studied in the past by bruno et al . for nitrogen shocks by a direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) model  @xcite .",
    "a much more important and complete nonthermal effect is expected in cases where the reaction threshold is much higher than the average thermal energy : the thermal rate of such processes is essentially zero , and calculations based on the method described in this paper can be used to define a specific rate @xmath125 which enters in an expression like @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the mole fraction of the trace partner @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the production rate of high energy atoms per unit volume and time .",
    "@xmath125 is therefore the number of reactive collisions of h atoms with a reactive trace species during their moderation , normalized to unit fraction of the trace ( but in practice the fraction is @xmath130 being @xmath128 a trace ) .",
    "examples of such reactions are the reaction of hydrogen with h@xmath64 leading to detachment in the so - called non associative channel : @xmath131 this process has a threshold of about @xmath132 and its cross section increases by an order of magnitude in the energy range @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "this reaction can be of relevance for chemical networks connected with radiation transport in astrophysical systems in view of the great importance of h@xmath64 ions as radiation absorbers .",
    "another example is the abstraction of h atoms from water , e.g. the reaction @xmath134    this is potentially an important reaction in astrophysical systems , since it represents a source of hydroxyl radicals in rotovibrationally excited states . in spite of this ,",
    "the above reaction is usually not included in chemical networks in view of its relative high threshold , about @xmath135 .",
    "this situation , however , can change in presence of superthermal atoms , and for future reference a calculation of its rate coefficient is provided as a function of the initial energy of h atoms .",
    "the rate constant @xmath136 can be evaluated by calculating , in a mc simulation , the sum @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the abstraction cross section and @xmath139 is the cross section of the elastic process , n is the number of h atoms in the simulation and the sum includes all h / h@xmath0 elastic collisions .",
