    "a hot and dense strongly interacting medium , the fireball , is produced in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hics ) . assuming rapid thermalization , the ensuing expansion phase has been modelled by relativistic hydrodynamics with considerable success  @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the fireball causes dilution of the energy density of the system .",
    "the medium mean free path elongates and finally drives the fireball out of equilibrium .",
    "the analysis of the hadron yields allows an access to the properties of the chemical freezeout ( cfo ) surface where the hadronic inelastic collisions ceased  @xcite .",
    "there are on going efforts to extract the cfo surface not only from the measured mean hadron yields but also from their higher order moments through the measurement of event by event ( e / e ) fluctuations of the qcd conserved charges  @xcite .    in the pre - lhc era , a unified cfo scheme where all the hadrons freezeout together , parametrised by a single temperature , baryon chemical potential and volume of the freezeout surface ( 1cfo ) , provided a satisfactory description of the yields across a wide range of @xmath0 from 2 - 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "the extracted cfo surface from these analyses was found in close proximity to the hadronization surface as indicated by lattice qcd studies at zero net - baryon densities  @xcite .",
    "this led to several suggestions like the hadrons are born directly into equilibrium at the time of hadronization  @xcite or the multi - particle interactions that maintain equilibrium are relevant only close to the hadronization surface  @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of an unambiguous microscopic description of the freeze - out dynamics and that the interaction cross - sections among various hadrons in the system not playing a manifestly important role left a sense of incompleteness in the 1cfo approach .",
    "in addition , it was observed that this approach is reasonably well applicable to @xmath1 , p+p and a+a collisions  @xcite , raising questions as to the sensitivity of the 1cfo scheme to the differences in the underlying interactions as expected for such a variety of systems .    the primordial yields in the hadron resonance gas model ( hrgm ) which is used to extract the freezeout conditions in the 1cfo scheme is given by n_i & = & _ k=1^(1)^k+1  k_2 ( ) e^k_i / t .",
    "[ eq.primmult ] here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the volume and temperature of the fireball .",
    "@xmath4 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer to the degeneracy factor , mass and hadron chemical potential of the @xmath8 hadron respectively .",
    "the total yield @xmath9 is obtained by including the resonance decay contribution to the above primordial yield n_i^ & = & n_i + _ j_ijn_j [ eq.totmult ] where @xmath10 is the branching ratio for the @xmath11 hadron to @xmath8 hadron . as of",
    "yet , this model has no predictive power since in principle , all the @xmath7s are independent of each other . at this stage , a crucial assumption is made of complete chemical equilibrium which allows to parametrise all the @xmath7s in terms of only @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14- three chemical potentials corresponding to the three conserved charges of qcd , namely baryon number @xmath15 , electric charge @xmath16 and strangeness @xmath17 _ i & = & b_i_b + q_i_q + s_i_s [ eq.mui ] now this is a phenomenologically viable model with only @xmath3 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 to fit from data while @xmath14 and @xmath13 are extracted from the conditions of strangeness neutrality and net baryon to net charge ratio of the colliding systems .",
    "thus , 1cfo is expected to work well if all the inelastic hadronic interactions freezeout together , in particular , if all the strangeness changing transmutations cease at the same instant as those that do not involve changing of strangeness .",
    "it is now well known that the standard 1cfo scheme fails to describe satisfactorily the hadron yields for pb+pb collisions at @xmath18 tev  @xcite which was termed as ` proton anomaly '  @xcite and also interpreted as tension in the non - strange vs strange sectors  @xcite with similar tensions existing even at lower @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a flavor dependent sequential freezeout scheme with different freezeout surfaces for strange and non - strange hadrons ( 2cfo ) was suggested based on flavor dependence in several thermodynamic quantities in lqcd computations  @xcite and known systematics of hadron cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "the 2cfo scheme was analysed and was found to provide a much improved description of the hadron yields  @xcite .",
    "the number of free parameters in 2cfo is double as compared to 1cfo .",
    "thus , despite compelling evidences for 2cfo , it is still possible to hypothise that the cause for the better performance of 2cfo could be simply due to availability of more free parameters and not due to physics . in this work",
    ", we test such a hypothesis by studying the cfo conditions in small systems like p+p and p+pb where 1cfo is expected to perform better than 2cfo . in small systems",
    ", there is much lesser hadronic interactions compared to pb+pb .",
    "the surprisingly thermal nature of the hadron abundances in such systems  @xcite is understood as a relic of hadronization  @xcite .",
    "thus , 2cfo is expected to perform worse than 1cfo here despite having more free parameters .",
    "we have analysed the mid - rapidity data for hadron yields in p+p  @xcite , p+pb  @xcite and pb+pb  @xcite collisions at @xmath197 , 5.02 and 2.76 tev respectively across all the available centralities . in doing so we cover over three orders of magnitudes in terms of the mid - rapidity charged multiplicty as well as the extracted fireball volume at the time of freezeout .",
    "this allows us to systematically study the system size dependence of the freezeout conditions .",
    "we have performed our analysis for three different freezeout schemes- 2cfo , 1cfo and 1cfo@xmath20 where @xmath21 takes into account the non - equilibrium production of strangeness .",
    "the hadrons whose mid - rapidity yields have been fitted to extract the cfo conditions are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 in all the systems .",
    "additionally , we have also used @xmath28 in p+pb and only @xmath29 in pb+pb . at these energies ,",
    "the data reveals good particle - antiparticle symmetry allowing us to take the hadron chemical potentials to be zero throughout this work .",
    "thus the parameters to be extracted from the thermal fits in 1cfo are only the fireball volume @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 at the time of freezeout . in the 1cfo@xmath20 scheme ,",
    "non - equilibrium production of strangeness is considered and we treat @xmath21 also as a fitting parameter . in the 2cfo scheme",
    "we stay within complete equilibrium setup . however , we allow for different freezeout thermal parameters for the non - strange and strange hadrons .",
    "thus we have two ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , three ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath21 ) and four ( non - strange and strange @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) parameters in 1cfo , 1cfo@xmath20 and 2cfo respectively to be extracted from fits to data on hadron yields .",
    "we have plotted the measured hadron yields in min - bias p+p  @xcite and different centralities of p+pb  @xcite and pb+pb  @xcite collisions and compared with the thermal model fits for the three freezeout schemes in fig .",
    "[ fig.dev ] . for clarity , we show results for only three centralities in p+pb and pb+pb , representing central , mid - central and peripheral collisions . in the lower panel of each figure , we have also shown the deviation @xmath31 given by & = & .",
    "[ eq.dev ] in p+p , the 1cfo scheme fares poorly with @xmath32 for proton .",
    "the 1cfo@xmath20 and 2cfo schemes seem to fare equally good , however the multi - strange baryons @xmath33 and @xmath34 have @xmath35 . similar situation as in p+p prevails through peripheral to mid - central p+pb collisions .",
    "there is considerable tension both in the mesonic as well as baryonic sectors in the 1cfo scheme which improves as we include @xmath21 in the 1cfo@xmath20 scheme .",
    "the situation changes slightly for the central bins . here",
    "the non - strange sector fares much better in the 1cfo scheme while the @xmath36 in the strange sector do not go away with more free parameters in the 1cfo@xmath20 and 2cfo schemes . in the 2cfo scheme with one more free parameter the agreement for proton betters but at the cost of @xmath25 mesons .",
    "overall we do nt gain by including an extra parameter in 2cfo as compared to 1cfo@xmath20 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig.dev ] where we have shown results for the pb+pb case .",
    "the scenario for the most peripheral pb+pb bin is similar to the central p+pb bins .",
    "all the schemes exhibit similar goodness of fit and the gain in improving the fit marginally in going from 1cfo to other schemes is compensated by the additional free parameters required .",
    "the other centralities exhibit strong tension between the non - strange and strange baryons in 1cfo . in 1cfo@xmath20 ,",
    "the agreement for the strange baryons improve but the tension between proton and @xmath29 continues while a mild tension between @xmath37 and kaons develop . unlike in p+p and p+pb , we find an appreciable improvement in the fits in 2cfo , only @xmath29 shows a mild deviation of @xmath38 .     for the different freezeout schemes . ]",
    "we now quantify the above discussion on the quality of fit in different schemes and systems .",
    "the goodness of fit in terms of @xmath39 ( @xmath40number of data points - number of free parameters ) for the different freezeout schemes across different centralities for pb+pb , p+pb and p+p collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.chisq ] . in all the schemes the fit quality deteriorates as we go from pb+pb to p+pb and p+p collisions .",
    "this is most dramatic for the 2cfo scheme where the @xmath39 rises from @xmath41 in pb+pb to @xmath42 in p+pb and p+p . in 1cfo ,",
    "@xmath39 ranges between @xmath43 in pb+pb while in p+pb and p+p it varies between @xmath44 .",
    "1cfo@xmath20 scheme gives largely a constant @xmath39 with a very mild rise from pb+pb ( @xmath39 @xmath45 ) to p+pb and p+p ( @xmath39 @xmath46 ) .",
    "the most important lesson that we learn from fig .",
    "[ fig.chisq ] is that the 2cfo freezeout scheme works only for large system size . in large systems ,",
    "the fireball lifetime is expected to be long resulting in sufficient interaction amongst constituents and thus the role of hadron - hadron cross sections come into play .",
    "the kaons mainly maintain the chemical equilibrium between the non - strange and strange sectors . in a cooling fireball",
    ", the kaon to pion ratio rapidly falls resulting in an early freezeout for strangeness  @xcite .",
    "this is the microscopic picture that is the motivation behind the 2cfo scheme .",
    "thus , high rate of hadronic interactions resulting in a hadronic medium formation is essential for 2cfo to work . on the other hand , in small systems",
    "the fireball lifetime is much shorter as the expansion dynamics is dominant resulting in little hadronic interactions .",
    "thus the hierarchy in hadron - hadron cross - sections do not enter the freezeout dynamics and we have a sudden freezeout scenario with all the hadrons freezing out together . from fig .",
    "[ fig.chisq ] , it is now clear that the better fits in the 2cfo scheme in hics is not due to mere doubling of parameters- 2cfo would then always provide the best fit across all systems .",
    "the fact that there is a very clear system size dependence over the choice of freezeout scheme and that 2cfo works best only in the expected regime and fail miserably elsewhere , provides a strong evidence that the better performance of 2cfo in hics is of physics origin .",
    ", volume @xmath2 and strangeness non - equilibrium factor @xmath21 ) amongst the three different freezeout schemes . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig.bestparameter ] we have plotted the freezeout parameters that provide the best description to the data amongst the three different freezeout schemes that we have studied here .",
    "we note that the freezeout temperature stays around @xmath47 mev for p+p , p+pb and also for the strange hadrons in pb+pb collisions .",
    "however , the non - strange hadrons in pb+pb breakaway from this trend . the higher rate of interaction in the strongly interacting hadronic medium casues a delayed freezeout for them and they finally freezeout at temperatures which are lower by about @xmath48 than those of the strange freezeout surface .",
    "all the centralities except the most peripheral bin of @xmath49 centrality in pb+pb is best described by 2cfo .",
    "the non strange freezeout temperature monotonically rises as one goes from central to peripheral bins and merge with its strange companion in the @xmath49 centrality bin .",
    "the @xmath49 centrality bin in pb+pb and the two most central bins of @xmath50 and @xmath51 of p+pb are best described by the 1cfo scheme . for the rest of the centralities in p+pb and p+p , it is essential to fit @xmath21 . within the 1cfo@xmath20 scheme ,",
    "the extracted @xmath21 in p+pb varies from @xmath52 for @xmath53 to @xmath54 centrality bins .",
    "the p+p freezeout conditions  @xcite are in agreement with that of peripheral p+pb .",
    "the temperatures extracted in hics can be contrasted to those obtained using the e / e fluctuation measures and the hadronisation temperature computed by lattice qcd .",
    "the freeze - out temperature obtained from analysis of fluctuation measure involving dominantly non - strange hadrons for au+au collisions at top rhic energy is @xmath55 mev  @xcite and is in agreement with the freeze - out temperature from 2cfo for non - strange hadrons in pb+pb collisions reported here .",
    "the hadronization temperatures reported by lqcd calculations at zero @xmath12 in ref .",
    "@xcite using strange - quark number susceptibilities are found to be closer to the freeze - out temperature reported here for strange hadrons , while hadronization temperature calculated using chiral condensates gives a value which is closer to the freeze - out temperature reported here for non - strange hadrons .",
    "however it may be noted that the systematic errors associated with the lcqd results are quite large .",
    "we have studied the system size dependence in the cfo conditions in p+p , p+pb and pb+pb collisions at the lhc . the late stage hadronic interactions in pb+pb are found to cause a sequential freezeout with early freezeout of strangeness as compared to the sudden and unified freezeout in p+p and p+pb due to domination of expansion over interaction .",
    "our study confirms that the analysis of the hadron yields within thermal models is sensitive to the physics of the cfo and the @xmath39 is a good measure to discriminate between the different cfo scenarios .",
    "if the analysis technique was blind to the underlying physics of the different cfo scenarios , one would expect 2cfo to perform the best across all system sizes as it has the highest number of free parameters amongst all the three cfo scenarios studied here .",
    "however , we explicitly show that this is not the case .",
    "2cfo performs best only in large system sizes with @xmath56 . for smaller systems , 2cfo clearly performs worse than the other scenarios .",
    "thus , our study strengthens the claim of 2cfo as a viable candidate of freezeout in hics .",
    "we note that there have been alternate scenarios to describe the hadron yields at the lhc as well- incorporating effects of non - equilibrium evolution either through a microscopic hadronic afterburner  @xcite or through additional flavor dependent fugacity factors  @xcite within the 1cfo scheme .",
    "it has also been suggested that the current discrepancy between models and data could be due to missing resonances in the models that have not been observed yet but are expected from qcd models and lqcd computations  @xcite .",
    "although , it is possible that including further resonances result in lowering the cfo temperatures by a few mev , we expect this to occur for both non - strange and strange sectors and thus a sequential freezeout scenario is likely to prevail .",
