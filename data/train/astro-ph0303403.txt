    "the recent identification of the transiting giant planet ogle - tr-56b ( konacki 2003 ) , was made possible by the successful photometric search for shallow transits by the ogle - iii team ( udalski 2002a , b ) .",
    "its parent star appears normal , with solar - like characteristics ( m=1.04  m@xmath10 , r=1.10  r@xmath10 ) ; so does the giant planet @xmath5 with @xmath2 & @xmath11 it is remarkably similar to hd  209458b ( the only other exoplanet with known radius ) .",
    "what sets ogle - tr-56b apart is its orbit @xmath5 only half as large ( at 0.023  au ) than the more typical orbit of hd  209458b ( at 0.045  au ) .    while there is nothing ",
    "typical \" about a gas giant planet with a 0.045  au orbit , the past 7 years have brought us a sizeable class of close - in giants like hd  209458b . starting with 51  peg ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , these now number 13 and show a curious  pile - up \" at @xmath12au ( or @xmath13 ) .",
    "the significant numbers of close - in giants suggests that inward migration in the protoplanetray disk is common , and the  pile - up \" indicates that a  parking \" mechanism with a sharp and robust cutoff must exist ( kuchner & lecar 2002 ) .",
    "this is important to planet formation in general , because the current incompatibility between formation timescales and migration timescales is not well understood .",
    "along comes ogle - tr-56b , well inside the  pile - up \" ( with @xmath0 ) , at almost the closest possible stable orbit .",
    "this jupiter - mass planet is close enough to raise variable tides on its star .",
    "the shear associated with them is presumed to be dissipated in the stellar convection zone by turbulent ( eddy ) viscosity ( zahn 1977 ; lecar , wheeler , mckee 1976 ) .",
    "a central unresolved issue has remained in this physical picture ( goodman & oh 1997 ; terquem 1998 ) : how does the tide couple to the convection turbulence , whether the largest eddies contribute to the total viscosity when the period of the tide is less than the eddy turnover time .",
    "choosing a side in this controversy can affect orbit decay estimates for close - in giant planets , as was pointed out by rasio ( 1996 ) , and illustrated by the results of some recent work ( patzold & rauer 2002 ; jiang , ip , yeh 2002 ) .",
    "more generally , other affected issues are tidal circularization of binary stars , stellar pulsations and oscillations ; this might be yet another indication that the now dated picture of stellar envelope convection needs changing .",
    "ogle - tr-56b is massive enough to raise tides on its star , yet not massive enough to synchronize it @xmath5 hence it is an ideal test particle for studies of tidal dissipation in the star s envelope .    in this paper",
    ", we study tidal decay and orbital stability for ogle - tr-56b in  3 and  4 , after describing in some detail the derived parameters of the ogle - tr-56 star - planet system from the observations in konacki ( 2003 ) .",
    "then in  5 we discuss the problem of halting inward migration ; and finally , in  6 we turn to the state of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "the stellar parameters were derived by modelling the high - resolution keck - hires spectra with numerical model atmospheres , and the star s mass and radius were computed from our stellar evolution tracks ( cody & sasselov 2002 ) .",
    "we use the opal equation of state ( rogers et al . 1996 ) and the latest livermore opacity tables ( opal96 ) .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates are calculated according to bahcall & pinsonneault ( 1995 ) .",
    "the diffusion of hydrogen and oxygen is treated after thoul , bahcall , & loeb ( 1994 ) .",
    "the upper boundary is an atmosphere with a temperature distribution from model atmosphere integration and kurucz ( 1992 ) opacities ; for models very different from the present sun , the eddington @xmath14 relation is used .",
    "convection is treated with the standard mixing - length prescription and the schwarzschild stability criterion .",
    "we find that ogle - tr-56 is very similar to the sun , with a temperature of @xmath15  k , and solar abundance of metals .",
    "the star s mass ( m=1.04@xmath160.05  m@xmath10 ) and radius ( r=1.10@xmath160.10  r@xmath10 ) make it a somewhat closer analog to hd  209458 than to the sun .",
    "combining the stellar parameters with the ogle - iii @xmath17-band photometry and the radial velocity data , yields the planetary mass , radius and mean density : 0.9@xmath18 , 1.3@xmath19 , and 0.5 g/@xmath20 ( konacki 2003 ) .",
    "we estimate the age of the star to be @xmath21  gyrs , which is also consistent with the somewhat faster than sun s rotation ( v@xmath22 ) derived from our spectra .",
    "the basic parameters of the ogle - tr-56 system are : orbital @xmath23d , star spin @xmath24d , separation @xmath25au , mass ratio @xmath26 , and mass in the stellar convection zone @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are aligned ; this is very likely and is known to be true for hd  209458 ( queloz 2000 ) , as well as is possible to measure by upcoming spectroscopic observations .",
    "we also assume a zero orbital eccentricity , @xmath30 , but will explore the timescales for circularization .",
    "although the current observations do not constrain the eccentricity of ogle - tr-56b s orbit , the theoretical expectation ( e.g. , goldreich & soter 1966 ; rasio 1996 ) is that the tides _ on the planet _ would have circularized its orbit a long time ago ( at age @xmath31 yrs ) .",
    "this is despite the fact that synchronization of the planet s spin occurs much faster ( @xmath32 yrs ) , following which the dissipation factor is much lower .",
    "the ogle - tr-56 system is then a case of a slowly rotating star experiencing fast tides , @xmath33 . _ in addition , _ the quadrupolar tidal forcing due to @xmath28 occurs with timescales much shorter than the correlation time of the turbulence in the star s convection zone .",
    "tidal dissipation is then expected to be strongly suppressed by local theory .",
    "just how much should the turbulent viscosity be inhibited has been a topic of controversy ( see goodman & oh 1997 and references therein ) ; ogle - tr-56 might shed some light on it .",
    "first we study the tide raised by the planet ogle - tr-56b on its star .",
    "it is a quadrupole tidal wave of amplitude / height @xmath34 ) above the hydrostatic equipotential of the stellar surface of radius @xmath35 .",
    "dissipative processes in the star , turbulent viscosity in its convection zone , cause this tidal bulge raised by the planet to lag behind by an angle @xmath36 radians , because @xmath33 .",
    "the bulge , of mass @xmath37 , then exerts a torque on the planet in a direction opposite to its orbital motion and the planet s orbit decays .",
    "the star , or at least its convection zone , is spun up .",
    "the rate of energy dissipation determines the rate of orbital evolution which we aim to derive .",
    "we follow the paradigm developed by lecar ( 1976 ) and zahn ( 1977 ) for stars with convection zones ; for now we keep @xmath30 .",
    "the planet induces tidal motions of order @xmath38 , a large - scale flow which sets up shear inside the star .",
    "the mostly radial convective motions inside the star tend to erase the shear and dissipate .",
    "this coupling between the tide and the convection eddies determines the magnitude of the lag angle @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitude , @xmath39 , and the lag angle , @xmath36 , of the tidal distortion determine the torque exerted on the planet , @xmath40 , and provide us with a general equation for the orbital decay : @xmath41 where the complex physics of the tide - convection coupling is swept inside the @xmath42 , which is called tidal coefficient by zahn ( 1977 ) @xmath5 a complex function of apsidal motion constants , @xmath43 ( a simple stellar interior description ) , and the lag angle , @xmath36 .",
    "alternatively , in a somewhat more simple and transparent derivation by lecar ( 1976 ) , the above equation remains the same , but with @xmath44 instead of @xmath42 .",
    "one could compare the response of the star to that of a forced harmonic oscillator and relate the phase angle to a specific dissipation function @xmath45 ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "here , @xmath46 is the energy stored in the tidal bulge , and @xmath47 , the rate of viscous dissipation of energy . in essence , this is another way to estimate @xmath36 , which has been used with assumed values for @xmath48 s of solar - like stars ( patzold & rauer 2002 ) .",
    "below we continue with the physically transparent approach ; basically @xmath49 in the parameters we use here .",
    "either way , the orbital decay rate will be a sensitive function of @xmath50 and @xmath35 , while estimating @xmath42 ( or @xmath36 alone ) will require a prescription for the tide - convection coupling .",
    "the adopted physical picture is based on the mixing - length theory of convection ( mlt ) and assumes a kolmogorov cascade of turbulent eddies ( goldreich & nicholson 1977 ; zahn 1989 ) .",
    "the oscillatory tidal large - scale shear is dissipated by turbulence , where the correlation time of the energy - bearing turbulent eddies is much longer than the shear period .",
    "the turbulent ( eddy ) viscosity is introduced in the sense of rayleigh - benard incompressible convection , @xmath51 , for a low forcing frequency . here , @xmath52 is the convective mixing length",
    ", @xmath53 is the convective velocity , and @xmath54 is the convective timescale ( eddy turnover time ) , in terms of mlt . assuming a kolmogorov cascade gives us the scalings for these quantities for eddies smaller than the mixing length . for a high forcing fequency , as is the case of ogle - tr-56 , momentum transport by the largest eddies , of scale @xmath52 , is inhibited . as already mentioned above , two competing prescriptions for the amount of this inhibition have been proposed : a linear one ( zahn 1977 , 1989 ) : @xmath55,\\ ] ] and a quadratic one ( goldreich & keeley 1977 ; goldreich & nicholson 1977 ) : @xmath56.\\ ] ] the former is introduced in part because it appears to lessen the disagreement with observed circularization periods of solar - type stellar binaries , and based on the large difference between the spatial scales of the tidal and covective velocity fields .",
    "the quadratic prescription is central to the theory of excitation and damping of the solar p - modes by convection , and is generally better justified theoretically ( goodman & oh 1997 ) .",
    "now we are ready to write a more direct expression for the timescale of orbital decay , @xmath57 , following the above picture ( phinney 1992 ; rasio 1996 ) : @xmath58 the numerical factor @xmath59 , obtained by integrating the total turbulent viscosity throughout the convection zone , is the focus of the theoretical controversy on the efficiency of eddy viscosity . while its value is of order unity for @xmath60 ( verbunt & phinney 1995 ) , for the case relevant to all close - in extrasolar planets and especially ogle - tr-56b , @xmath61 , and with quadratic suppression of @xmath62 we have @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "we shall make use of the expression for @xmath57 from the previous section to evaluate the stability of the orbit of the new transiting planet ogle - tr-56b .",
    "first , we should note that both the linear and quadratic theoretical prescriptions for eddy viscosity suppression are in conflict with the observations of the circularization of main - sequence binary stars ( latham 1992 ; goodman & oh 1997 ; terquem 1998 ) . a mechanism other than turbulent convection needs to be invoked , or the mlt description which gives us @xmath54 could be to blame . of course , binary stars are not good test cases for the problem we investigate here , because they synchronize each other very fast , while ogle - tr-56b is not capable to spin - up its star , as we shall see here . for binary stars , both the circularization , @xmath64 , and decay , @xmath57 , timescales are much longer than the synchronization timescales , and are comparable to each other ( zahn 1977 ; terquem 1998 ) : @xmath65 .",
    "in the absence of other mechanisms , the possibility should be explored that the culprit might be the incorrect topology of convection implied by mlt .",
    "for example , numerical simulations of stellar envelope convection ( stein & nordlund 1989 ; ludwig , frytag , steffen 1999 ) indicate large convective velocities in a generally weakened vertical heat transport @xmath5 maintaining similar length scales .",
    "this corresponds to an increase in the brunt - vsl frequency , @xmath66 ; and as a reminder : @xmath67 .",
    "terquem ( 1998 ) have shown that increasing @xmath66 can come close to resolving the stellar circularization problem , without contradicting helioseismological data .",
    "ogle - tr-56b s orbit could be used to test this idea and physical picture ( sasselov , in prep . ) .",
    "one could then derive an expression for the orbital decay , @xmath57 , which is calibrated to fit the observations , assuming a mechanism like the increased @xmath66 .",
    "this can be done with the known values for the circularization of solar - type binaries ( terquem 1998 ; meibom & mathieu 2003 ) : @xmath68  gyr for @xmath69  days . with the additional approximation , that @xmath57 is accurately determined by the initial position of the planet ( because the torque increases as it spirals in ) , we have : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is in days .    using our interior models for the star ogle - tr-56",
    ", we derive the parameters of its convection zone , including @xmath72 days .",
    "first , we estimate the orbital decay timescale for ogle - tr-56b with the observationally calibrated formula above : @xmath73 with an uncertainty of at least @xmath74 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "thus such large amounts of dissipation , as seemed to be requred by stellar binaries , appear excluded by the planet s orbit .",
    "approaches that do not allow for any viscosity suppression , @xmath75 , ( e.g. , patzold & rauer 2002 ) are excluded by the existence of ogle - tr-56b .",
    "tidal dissipation mechanisms with more effective source of viscosity ( @xmath76 ) , such as caused by magnetic fields , are even more strongly excluded by ogle - tr-56b .",
    "however , already rasio ( 1996 ) had shown that these were excluded also by 51  peg  b.    on the other hand , the theoretical models of turbulent viscosity dissipation give comfortable estimates for the orbital stability of ogle - tr-56b ; for the linear prescription : @xmath77 and for the quadratic prescription , the orbital decay is insignificant , with : @xmath78 the results are summarized in figure 1 , and point to the real possibility for detecting changes in the orbit of ogle - tr-56b by precise timing of its transits",
    ". the observationally calibrated orbital decay estimates would give @xmath79  msec / yr , with a range between 0.1 and 5 msec / yr , given the large uncertainties ( the quadratic prescription is undetectable ) .",
    "this is precision which can be achieved with hst photometry of the transit light curve ( for a high quality template and zero point ) over a 2-year interval and additional ground - based observations .",
    "the currently available ground - based transits have provided only 0.9  sec accuracy of its orbital period , but this can be improved significantly by further dedicated observations and an hst template and zero point .",
    "as illustrated in figure 1 , ogle - tr-56b stands in a class of its own , well to the left of the currently observed `` pile - up '' of close - in extrasolar giant planets .",
    "it is an obvious candidate for the class ii planet model suggested by trilling ( 1998 ) and elaborated further by lin ( 2000 ) @xmath5 planets that migrate inwards in a protoplanetary disk , lose some ( but not all ) of their mass via roche - lobe overflow , and survive in very small orbits .",
    "while the planet is losing mass the inward torque from the disk is balanced by the outward torque from the fast spinning pre - main - sequence star and the conservation of angular momentum ( apart from reducing the planet s mass ) .",
    "nevertheless , a fairly prompt disappearance of the inward torquing disk ( @xmath80 yrs ) is required , because planets in the 3 - 5  m@xmath81 mass range will be consumed within that time .",
    "this is due in part to the m - r relation characteristic for giant planets and the resulting flat @xmath82 function .",
    "notably , it is not necessary for the entire circumstellar disk to disappear , but just the inner part of it , which contributes enough inward torque density to the planet at its close orbit . in other words ,",
    "an enlargement of the central disk hole during those @xmath83 , would have the same effect .",
    "inward migration is then halted , as discussed by kuchner & lecar ( 2002 ) .",
    "the `` survival '' orbits are bound on the inside by the roche - lobe overflow and orbital decay boundaries ( figure 1 ) . on the outside , these orbits will be limited by the amount of outward torque to the planet by the faster spinning pre - main - sequence star .",
    "typical stellar spin periods at that early age are often @xmath84  day , i.e. , a planet at the roche - lobe overflow orbit ( @xmath85  day will experience outward torque ( same expressions as in  3 & 4 apply , but with opposite sign ) . with the rates discussed above , the planet s",
    "inward migration could be stalled , but even if the spin - orbit interaction continues as an outward torque after the disappearance of the disk , the planet will not be able to migrate significantly outwards .    such a mechanism would then create a separate distribution of close - in giant planets , peaked around @xmath86  day periods , with clear gap separating them from the now well - established distribution of close - in planets at @xmath87  days . the timing experiment suggested above for ogle - tr-56b could be capable to reveal the presence of a comparable - mass planet in a further out orbit , which might have created this unusually close orbit .",
    "ogle - tr-56b is so close to its star , that its atmospheric structure is completely dominated by the large incident stellar irradiation . here",
    "we use the modeling techniques described by seager & sasselov ( 2000 ) to compute the temperature structure on the dayside hemisphere of the planet .",
    "the incident flux is from the model atmosphere calculation for ogle - tr-56 described in  2 .",
    "the result for the dayside hemisphere resembles closely the t - p profiles for other close - in extrasolar planets ( seager , whitney & sasselov 2000 ) , with a very shallow temperature gradient all throughout , except that ogle - tr-56b is very hot , at @xmath88 = 1850 k , even by  hot jupiter s \" standards .    given the very high temperature the issue of atmospheric stability",
    "to evaporation is very relevant .",
    "the mean density of ogle - tr-56b points to hydrogen and helium as its main constituents .",
    "the loss of h and he from a planet may occur by several means .",
    "to first order , jeans `` thermal evaporation '' gives a lower limit to the escape flux , even after corrections for radiation pressure on satellite particle orbits are added ( chamberlain & hunten 1987 ) : @xmath89,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being the particle mass .",
    "this evaporation occurs from the exobase ( @xmath92 ) of the planet s atmosphere , where the particle density is @xmath93 .",
    "the conditions at the exobase are determined by our model .",
    "namely , with @xmath94 at the exobase and thermal r.m.s .",
    "velocity for hydrogen of @xmath95 , we do not find any evidence for fast evaporation or the existence of a blow - off state .",
    "the hydrogen escape flux is of order @xmath96  g.s@xmath97 .",
    "the existence of a planetary magnetic field could lead to larger mass loss fluxes , but currently we have no such evidence ( with the possible exception of a recent h lyman @xmath98 detection of an extended exosphere around hd  209458b by vidal - madjar 2003 ) .",
    "as regards the deeper atmosphere , the high temperatures and small temperature gradient make the case for cloud formation ( of al@xmath6o@xmath7 , fe(s ) , and ti@xmath7o@xmath99 ) unclear .",
    "the structure of ogle - tr-56b s atmosphere appears especially conducive to the formation of  iron clouds \" , fe(s ) condensates , due to their stronger pressure dependance , e.g. , compared to the other high - temperature condensate al@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "such clouds are highly absorbing ( seager , whitney , & sasselov 2000 ) and would reduce significantly the albedo of ogle - tr-56b . atmospheric dynamics , e.g. , as modeled by cho ( 2002 ) and showman & guillot ( 2002 ) , may further lessen the chances of any cloud formation , except in localized low - pressure systems .",
    "ogle - tr-56b has an orbit which is close enough to its star to allow a test of tidal dissipation of stellar convection zone .",
    "it represents a test which is different from the currently available stellar binary circularization constraint , because the planet is too small to spin - up the star . in analyzing the orbital and physical parameters of the new extremely close - in and hot transiting giant planet ogle - tr-56b",
    ", we find that :    \\(1 ) its orbit is stable to orbital decay , if quadratic or linear suppression of turbulent eddy viscosity in the parent star is assumed ; the linear prescription gives orbital decay rates which might be detectable by a precision timing experiments using the transits , and if successful could settle a long - standing issue regarding dissipation in stellar convection zones .",
    "ogle - tr-56b appears to define a new class of giant extrasolar planets , in terms of the mechanism by which it attained its current small orbit .",
    "the extreme parameters of this planet allow for the first time some interesting constraints .",
