    "multicellularity has evolved multiple times through the history of our planet , leading to a wide array of spatially organised living structures such as aggregates , sheets , clusters or filaments ( 1 ) .",
    "the transition to multicellularity required the emergence of alternative cellular states along with stable , physical interactions among previously isolated cells ( 2 - 5 ) . in our present - day biosphere ,",
    "multicellular systems display intricate spatial and temporal patterns implemented by developmental programs , which are tightly controlled by genetic networks ( 6,7 ) .",
    "but an early stage might have involved non - inherited stochastic phenotypic switches and physical aggregation phenomena that could have given rise to some class of cooperating multicellular assemblies ( 8,9 ) .",
    "this is supported by the well - known observation that single - celled organisms can behave as multicellular systems using precisely these processes ( 10 ) particularly in the face of high - stress events ( 11 - 13 ) .",
    "simple multicellular systems , such as _ anabaena _ , where cell differentiation is induced under nitrogen deprivation , or mixobacteria ( 10 ) are examples of the minimal types of multicellular organisation ( 14,15 ) . a minimal form of multicellularity is provided by persister cells and phase variation phenomena , i.e. slow - growing cell subpopulations that can spontaneously switch back and forth among multiple resistant phenotypes , as a bet - hedging strategy in front of potential catastrophe(16,17 ) .",
    "in this paper we aim to explore the potential for _ organismality _ ( 18 ) emerging from a minimal set of assumptions , including ( a ) multistability ( 19 ) , incorporated as a stochastic bistable phenotype ( 20 ) , allowing for two cell types ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , ( b ) differential adhesion , which can lead to spatial segregation of different proto - tissues and pervades several key processes of development ( 5,21 ) and ( c ) a selective environment where the presence of external nutrient and toxic waste forces the selection of genotypes with higher fitness . both types of cells can survive only in presence of nutrient , which is transformed into internal energy , and die if exposed to high concentrations of waste .",
    "cells of type 2 have the additional capability of degrading waste in medium , at the expense of their capability of elaborating nutrient .",
    "previous models involving the evolution of undifferentiated multicellularity ( 22,23 ) have shown that appropriate metabolic trade - offs might pervade the coexistence of cell clusters .",
    "our model goes a step further by allowing alternative cell states to organize in space .",
    "we find that if the system is allowed to exploit spatial organization , its evolution gives rise not only to cell heterogeneity , but also to nested substructures and to the creation of an internal environment , thus suggesting that combining differential adhesion and multistability provides the necessary toolkit for evolving proto - organisms in a robust manner .",
    "the results reported here indicate that the generative potential which is typical of the morphological landscape can also be obtained by a simple , previously unexplored set of pattern - forming rules , where cell - cell communication or genetic networks are not taken in account .",
    "it contains the three key components of evolved mc ( 24 ) namely ( a ) fitness - coupled spatial patterning , ( b ) cooperation and specialization and ( c ) a transition from `` simple '' to `` complex '' multicellular forms .",
    "our assumption is that aggregative organisms involving multiple cell states present a better fitness than single - state organisms in a habitat with limited resources and toxic molecules . to delve into the accuracy of our assumption",
    ", we consider a model in which cells are able to stochastically switch between two different metabolic states , and present differential cell - cell adhesion ( fig .",
    "1 ) . if a cell is able to survive to the habitat s conditions , it will spread its offspring , allowing to achieve maximum fitness by means of an evolutionary process involving mutation of parameters .",
    "a selective environment is introduced including both an incoming external nutrient ( @xmath2 ) and a toxic waste ( @xmath3 ) as well as an internal currency molecule ( @xmath4 ) . a regular @xmath5 square lattice @xmath6 is used .",
    "each site @xmath7 is characterized by a state , indicated as @xmath8 .",
    "this state can be @xmath9 if the site is empty and either @xmath0 or @xmath1 if the site is occupied by cells .",
    "these two values indicate two different cell types with different adhesion and metabolic properties .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are added continuously to the empty lattice sites and passively diffuse through the external medium and across nearest cells .",
    "energy @xmath4 is created by cellular metabolism , as an intracellular product of nutrient processing .",
    "cells of type 2 can allocate resources for waste degradation , at the cost of reduced nutrient elaboration , following a linear tradeoff ( @xmath10 ) consistent with a maximum metabolic load and shared resources for protein synthesis . for type-1 cells we have @xmath11 .",
    "all three molecules experience linear degradation .",
    "the spatial dynamics are described by a discrete set of coupled differential equations .",
    "for each site @xmath7 : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 include decay and active removal of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we have used the dirac s delta function @xmath17 if @xmath18 and zero otherwise .",
    "similarly , the input terms @xmath19 for each site are effective provided that the site is empty .",
    "the normalisation factor @xmath20 ( the fraction of sites occupied by cells ) ensures a constant flux of @xmath2 and @xmath3 throughout the lattice .",
    "a cell divides when its @xmath4-value increases beyond a fixed threshold ( @xmath21 ) and there is an empty site in the vicinity .",
    "this new cell inherits the genotype and the phenotypic state of the progenitor with a small chance of mutations ( see si ) , and the energy is equally split among the two ( i.e. no asymmetric divisions are considered ) .",
    "conversely , cells die if the @xmath3 value surpasses another fixed threshold ( @xmath22 ) , if @xmath4 falls below a critical value ( @xmath23 ) , or with a small random probability ( @xmath24 ) , releasing their contents ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 as nutrient ) to the surrounding medium . following this formulation",
    ", there is a natural competition for resources that can promote selection of different multicellular communities .    , @xmath25 ) are the probabilities that no change occurs for grey or black cells respectively",
    ". cells also interact with the local fields of a nurturing substance ( @xmath2 ) and a toxic metabolite ( @xmath3 ) , which are involved in cell duplication , survival and death .",
    "the metabolism of black cell includes the ability to degrade waste ( blue arrow ) .",
    "( d ) in our model cells move by swapping locations with a neighboring cell , provided that the final energy is reduced , in accordance with their ( evolved ) adhesion properties.,width=8 ]          we introduce genetics in our model in the form of a stochastic transition between phenotypes ( fig .",
    "1c ) relevant for cell sorting and metabolism , as it is assumed in phase and antigenic variation in certain microbial populations ( 16,25,26 ) . specifically , cells can switch between states with evolvable probabilities @xmath26 $ ] , i. e. : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a fixed scaling factor , introduced to account for the time scale separation between adhesion kinetics and genetic processes .",
    "therefore , the phenotypic transitions are not dependent on any molecular cue nor cellular memory beyond their current state .",
    "the physics of cell sorting can be introduced considering the arrangement of cells constrained by their local preferences ( 27,28 ) . following steinberg s differential adhesion model ( dah )",
    "we assume that cells movement are driven by the minimization of adhesion energy being cells more or less prone to remain together , avoiding the external medium , or maximizing contact with it ( 5,28 - 31 ) .",
    "an adhesion ( or interaction ) matrix @xmath29 weights the strength of pairwise interactions among neigbouring sites : @xmath30 which is symmetric , i. e. @xmath31 , and has @xmath32 . other approaches ( 32 ) consider each cell as formed by a number of sites , thus allowing for a better matching with the underlyng physics of cells .",
    "for simplicity , we keep our model confined to a one cell - one site scheme .",
    "since cell - cell ( and cell - medium ) interactions are necessarily local ( fig .",
    "1c ) , a given cell can only interact with a set @xmath33 of eight nearest neighbors .",
    "the model allows cell movement between neighboring positions by switching the two local states provided that the final state is more likely to happen , i. e. consistent with the optimization of both cell adhesion energies .",
    "this is given by an energy function : @xmath34 \\over ( 2 - \\delta_{(0,s_{ij } ) } -\\delta_{(0,s_{kl})})}\\ ] ] which averages the interaction matrix of both cells .",
    "the superindexes denote the adhesion matrix of a particular site and normalise the effect of interacting with empty medium .    at each step , we choose a random neighbor for each site , compute the new energy @xmath35 and compare it to the original one @xmath36 . if the difference @xmath37 is negative , a decrease in the global energy would occur and thus the state swap is always applied . instead ,",
    "when @xmath38 , the largest the difference the less likely the change is assumed to happen , with a probability following the boltzmann rule ( for more details see sm1 ) : @xmath39 as defined , the transition is likely to occur if an energy reduction takes place , with a noise factor introduced by @xmath40 , acting as an effective `` temperature '' .",
    "a small stochasticity prevents the system from getting trapped into local energy minima .",
    "in order to analyse the prevalence of multicellular traits , we have explored the role played by nutrient and waste inputs in selecting different phenotypes by evolving the different parameters .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2a .",
    "simulations are started with type 1 cells only with no adhesion ( i. e. , @xmath41 for all adhesion strengths ) thus behaving as random walkers ( since @xmath42 and thus @xmath43 ) .",
    "this parameter space displays three main phases , including a cell - free ( extinction ) phase , a second phase with sparse distribution of unicellular populations ( lower domain ) and an intermediate phase ( marked by a thick line ) associated to organismal structures .",
    "moreover , different measures were applied to these endpoint states of evolutionary processes ( fig .",
    "2b - c ) , showing an overall increase in complexity for the multicellular region of this phase space in terms of structural organization and genetic diversity ( see si ) .",
    "in particular , the increase in genetic diversity is due to the existence of multiple distinguishable species that create different , complex spatial arrangements , as measured by the spatial mutual information measure .      within the multicellular region of this phase space ,",
    "proto - organisms display consistent spatial and temporal structures of remarkable complexity . typically , an outer layer of cells that develops aggregative features in order to withstand the mounting levels of toxic waste , and which surrounds and protects an internal environment with lower @xmath3 and @xmath2 levels , suitable to be colonized by cells that preferentially expose to the environment . within these `` container ''",
    "other cell types ( not viable outside these boundaries ) can coexist ( fig 1a ) .",
    "these nested structures define a proto - organism , reminiscent of biologically relevant organisations like @xmath44 @xmath45 , and can regenerate the protective layer in case it breaks or even create a whole new proto - organism , thus acting as a propagule ( see sm1 ) and effectively defining a rudimentary life cycle .",
    "moreover , given the spatial constraints to the local concentration and flows of metabolites caused by the organisation of cell types , ecosystem engineering is also present ( 33,34 ) .          beyond the small scale dynamics of the system , the particular paths taken by each population in the evolutionary process were also analyzed . in figure 3",
    "we display the evolutionary dynamics of three different scenarios using a reduced genotype space .",
    "in particular , we find that the tendency to form homo - aggregates of each cell type and the waste degradation potential yield a functional clustering of individuals into discrete subpopulations or species ( see si for a principal component analysis of the population genotypes ) .",
    "these populations will generate aggregates of a particular type if @xmath46 , and will display unicellular traits -i.e .",
    "will tend to attach to the external medium- otherwise .",
    "also , cells will process more waste at the expense of efficiency in nutrient absorption the lower the @xmath47 values .",
    "the first example shows the evolution of a  simple \" , undifferentiating aggregative species ( m1 ) under medium energetic conditions and high inputs of waste .",
    "the other two -different runs of the same parameter set- display coexisting species , giving rise to complex multicellular phenotypes with differentiation and division of labor .",
    "interestingly , all three cases share the same lineages for a short period at the beginning of the simulation yet soon diverge into different evolutionary histories .",
    "for instance , in the second scenario the type 1 unicellular lineage ( u1 ) acquires a protective aggregative layer that is also proficient in processing waste ( thus becoming m2u1 ) , while in the third case it is the aggregative species m1 that fills the u1 niche once this strain disappears , evolving into m1u2 ( see also sm2 3 & 4 ) .",
    "the evolution of these mirror multicellular proto - organisms m2u1 ( fig .",
    "3b ) and m1u2 ( fig.c ) -which are essentially the same phenotype with switched adhesion properties between the two cell types , yet coming from different lineages- , is a clear example of convergent evolution and path - dependance in our system .",
    "figures 3e - f show the population dynamics and the evolution of the mutual information of the system in each simulation . in the first case ,",
    "the population follows a classic logistic growth and has a fixed , stable mi .",
    "the other two , instead , display heavy fluctuations in both the population levels and the mutual information , even showing signs of quasi - periodic dynamics ( b ) .",
    "it can also be clearly observed the emergence of a new species and its impact in the mutual information in the third dataset ( arrow marks the branching of the main species m1 into m1u2 at approximatelly @xmath48 iterations ) .      in previous examples",
    "some species are shown to coexist while others appear to be mutually exclusive , implying a rich repertoire of underlying ecological interactions . in order to better understand the fitness dependencies and evolution of multicellular traits in our model , we performed controlled experiments with some of the most commonly observed genotypes and two different environments : one with abundance of nutrient and waste , and a more stringent one with lower levels of nutrient and toxic metabolites . in each simulation",
    "the lattice was inoculated with a few cells of one or two genotypes : namely @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath50 and @xmath49 together , m1m2 and m1m2r .",
    "figure 4a shows the normalised population size in each scenario attained after @xmath52 iterations .",
    "some genotypes appear to be viable in only one of the two environments , while some ( especially m1u2/m2u1 ) provide efficient growth in both , possibly being the most fit genotype in fluctuating environments .    ) after @xmath52 algorithm iterations of growth without mutation by different genotypes or combinations of them . for two environments ( @xmath53 in filled boxes and @xmath54 in white boxes ) ,",
    "an empty lattice was inoculated with a few cells ( basal dotted line ) of one or two genotypes , from left to right : u1 , m1 , m1u2/m2u1 , m1 and u1 together ( m1 shown ) , m1 and u1 together ( u1 shown ) , m1m2 and m1m2r .",
    "boxes represent the limits of the first and the third quartile of the data , the central line is the median value and bars stand for the most extreme values not considered outliers , which are plotted individually as circles ( 50 simulations for each condition ) .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 link datasets that were found to have different mean values ( t - test , significance @xmath57 ) . in ( b ) and ( c )",
    "we show the impact of the initial cell number ( @xmath58 ) on growth rates ( @xmath59 ) for the same environments and genotypes previously used ( 25 simulations of each condition ) . in the high @xmath3 environment ( c ) a cooperative domain",
    "is found below a finite population size , in which adding cells to the propagule non - linearly increases growth rates . beyond this fitness peak ,",
    "cells compete for resources and space , leading to a cumulative decrease in fitness similar to the results obtained in the low @xmath3 environment ( b).,width=8 ]    interestingly , the nature of the ecological interaction among genotypes u1 and m1 is shown to switch from straight competition in the low @xmath3 and @xmath2 scenario to parasitism in the high @xmath3 and @xmath2 scenario .",
    "in fact , in the first scenario both genotypes survive when alone but they compete for scarce resources when together , marking a decrease in the fitness of both genotypes . on the contrary , in the latter scenario only m1 survives when genotypes are alone , but creates a protective layer for u1 when genotypes live together , so that u1 can survive at the expenses of m1 , which receives less @xmath2 and sees its fitness decrease . as commented previously , this is mainly caused by the capacity of multicellular entities to create an internal environment , which can be colonized by unicellular species , similarly to a parasitic microbiome - host relation .",
    "figures 4bc , on the other hand , characterize the interactions between cells of the same genotype by varying the initial population size ( @xmath58 ) in the same environments . using the initial population and the growth after @xmath52 iterations we approximate the specific growth rate following :    @xmath60",
    "we observe that regardless of the genotype , cells compete for resources and space in the low energy input scenario ( b ) , meaning that each cell added to the initial population decreases the growth rate of the whole .",
    "a very different set of interactions appears to be in place in the high waste environment ( c ) , giving rise to a cooperation domain in which increasing the propagule size increases the growth rate of the whole , resorting afterwards to competition between cells .",
    "this suggests that , under this simple rules , an optimum propagule size exists and a fitness beyond the individual has emerged .",
    "emerging multicellularity can be described as cooperative groups of cells assembled from independent replicators ( 18 ) .",
    "this transition might have involved different paths , from mixed aggregates to clonal organisms with simple developmental plans and life cycles .",
    "the existing literature usually deals with cooperators achieving some kind of selective advantage as a consequence of mutualism , including spatial clustering or structured communities , as it occurs in biofilms ( 35 - 37 ) .",
    "but true organismality , with a diverse set of cellular phenotypes arranged in space as a functional structure , has not been previously described as emerging from evolved interactions among simple virtual cells embodied as darwinian entities .",
    "here we have provided a minimal set of rules grounded in biological processes that shift the selective pressures towards aggregative behaviour and division of labor .",
    "morphological complexity ( 38 ) increased throughout our simulations and a fitness transfer was shown to be in place with the evolution of @xmath47 .",
    "interestingly , those cells with lower values of @xmath47 , also displayed stronger attachment between them ( lower @xmath61 ) .",
    "this suggests that from a game theoretical perspective cells become  intelligent \" players and try to surround themselves with other players whose strategy is the most mutually beneficial .",
    "although our cells live in an non - clonal environment ( 39 ) , they can manipulate who do they stand next to , potentially shaping local genetic relatedness .",
    "this would ensure that the investment in @xmath3 reduction mostly benefits cells with a similar genotype , paving the way for the evolution of cooperative and altruistic behavior ( 40 ) .    as a premise for this model",
    ", we have assumed the existence of death promoting agents in the environment , of which there are several naturally occurring candidates , like : oxygen ( 41,42 ) , secreted antibiotics ( 43 ) or exoenzymes and toxins ( 44,45 ) .",
    "we think that a particularly interesting scenario is the one given by niche construction ( 46 ) , in which the efforts to exclude extant microorganisms from the population by other ecological players might drive the evolution of multicellularity .",
    "such relation would entail a coupling between ecological and organismal complexity , a link that has eluded previous efforts in artificial life research ( see ( 47 ) and references therein ) .    by allowing our virtual cells to evolve through mutation of parameters affecting interactions with the external fields as well as with other cells , we provide a clear framework to evolve complexity under selection .",
    "the result of this is a system that spontaneously evolves , under many parametric conditions , to a complex , spatially organized multicellular state .",
    "the embodied structures emerging from the interplay of cell sorting and stochastic phenotypic switching display interesting and relevant features , including spatial modification of concentrations and flows of resources as well as temporal dynamics resembling proto - life cycles . in these spatial communities ,",
    "pattern formation is enforced by the optimization of nutrient uptake along with an efficient removal of waste . in doing so ,",
    "our cell assemblies arrange themselves in fitness - coupled collectives , indicating that organismality might be an inevitable outcome while solving the conflict associated to simultaneously dealing with both requirements .",
    "our analysis also suggests that in the context of the evolution of organismality proposed in ( 18 ) our proto - organisms would fit in the high cooperation - reduced conflict category .",
    "this class of entities harbours species of disparate complexity , yet all showing a fitness - relevant division of labor and differentiation , which stand at the core of our model .",
    "specifically , some artificial organisms have been shown to include an exclusively cooperative domain and specialisation in terms of a metabolic trade - off , producing a fitness transfer from one cell type to the other .",
    "differentiation into terminal lineages ( i.e. generating a soma ) , although not contemplated in our current formulation , appears to be a basic requirement to further reduce conflict among cells and attain  true multicellularity \" .",
    "the model presented here can be improved by incorporating a more realistic physics allowing for movement of aggregates ( 48 ) as well as heterogeneous media ( 49 ) where resources and waste might be generated in a non - homogeneous fashion .",
    "similarly , we have limited ourselves to a binary switch , therefore confining the functional cell diversity to two main classes .",
    "we also assume that cell types are always alive , excluding the possibility of having material scaffolds formed through the differentiation processes , as it occurs with many solitary and colony - forming microorganisms in shallow waters .",
    "no less relevant in this context is the potential of creating multicellular systems by means of artificial evolution experiments ( 50 - 52 ) or synthetic biology approaches ( 53 - 56 ) .",
    "there is a great potential associated to the use of existing genetic components to engineer pattern - forming modules .",
    "our proposed minimal system might help defining feasible paths to implement proto - organisms .",
    "we thank the members of the complex systems lab for useful discussions .",

    "<S> the rise of multicellularity in the early evolution of life represents a major challenge for evolutionary biology . </S>",
    "<S> guidance for finding answers has emerged from disparate fields , from phylogenetics to modelling and synthetic biology , but little is known about the potential origins of multicellular aggregates before genetic programs took full control of developmental processes . </S>",
    "<S> such aggregates should involve spatial organisation of differentiated cells and the modification of flows and concentrations of metabolites within well defined boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that , in an environment where limited nutrients and toxic metabolites are introduced , a population of cells capable of stochastic differentiation and differential adhesion can develop into multicellular aggregates with a complex internal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the morphospace of possible patterns is shown to be very rich , including proto - organisms that display a high degree of organisational complexity , far beyond simple heterogeneous populations of cells . </S>",
    "<S> our findings reveal that there is a potentially enormous richness of organismal complexity between simple mixed cooperators and embodied living organisms . </S>"
