    "seyfert galaxies have weak and small radio sources , with typical sizes @xmath10  pc and typical centimeter - wavelength powers of @xmath11  w  hz@xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these sources are apparently produced by weak jets whose axes are determined by the galaxies central obscuring disks , and interacting with thermal gas within ionization cones ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of gas disks or tori is supported by the obscuration of broad lines in a number of seyfert 2 galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , by vlbi imaging of h@xmath12o masers in ngc  4258 ( @xcite ) , and by parsec - scale hi absorption in other active galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is of considerable interest to measure the speeds of seyfert radio jets close to their central engines , to attempt to differentiate between `` intrinsic '' and `` environmental '' effects .",
    "previous measurements of jet speeds in seyfert cores are rare . in ngc  4151 ,",
    "upper limits of @xmath13 and @xmath14 have been measured on scales of 7 and 36  pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "component positions in ngc  1068 , measured with the very large array in 1983 ( @xcite ) and with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) in 1996 ( @xcite ) , imply an upper limit of @xmath15 for components @xmath16  pc apart .",
    "recently , in iii  zw  2 , falcke et al .",
    "( 1999 ) inferred an apparent speed @xmath17 on a sub - parsec scale , based on a single vlbi image following a flux outburst .",
    "the galaxies mrk  231 and mrk  348 contain two of the strongest radio sources found in seyferts , and are prime candidates for the measurement of motions in their cores . within larger - scale vlbi structures , each galaxy contains a parsec - scale double radio source ( @xcite ; ulvestad , wrobel , & carilli 1999 ) .",
    "those central sources have now been imaged at two epochs using the vlba ; this _ letter _ reports measurements of the component separation speeds on scales of @xmath18  pc .",
    "the vlba ( @xcite ) was used to observe mrk  231 and mrk  348 at two epochs separated by @xmath19  yr , between 1996 and 1998 . for each galaxy , observing frequencies ranged from 1.4 to 22  ghz ; the images at 15.365  ghz , obtained in left - circular polarization , have the best combination of resolution and sensitivity for the compact components , and are the subject of this _",
    "letter_. all data were initially calibrated in aips ( @xcite ) , then iteratively imaged and self - calibrated in difmap ( @xcite ) . on -",
    "source integration times ranged from 1.2 to 2.6  hr , resulting in r.m.s .",
    "noises of 0.41.1  mjy  beam@xmath4 for the final uniformly weighted images .",
    "two - component gaussian models were fitted in both the ( _ u , v _ ) plane and the image plane ; we use the image - plane fits here .",
    "flux - density errors ( all errors are @xmath20 ) were derived by combining a 5% scale uncertainty in quadrature with the fitting error ( including noise ) . estimated",
    "size errors are 20% in each axis , with point sources taken to have upper limits of half the beam size .",
    "errors in relative component positions are consistent with the measured noises , except for the first - epoch image of mrk  231 , where the quoted error is the total range found by using different fitting procedures .",
    "mrk 348 has a redshift @xmath21 ( @xcite ) , yielding a scale of 0.31  pc  mas@xmath4 for @xmath22  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 ( used throughout ) .",
    "this galaxy is a type 2 seyfert with a hidden broad - line region ( @xcite ) , implying that its inner disk is nearly edge - on .",
    "it also contains a 200-mas triple radio source ( @xcite ) coinciding with optical [ o  iii ] emission imaged by capetti et al .",
    "our vlba images ( figure  [ fig:348-im ] ) show a small - scale double source that is aligned with the larger scale radio and optical emission .",
    "phase referencing at the second epoch gives a j2000 position for the stronger component of @xmath231422 , @xmath24044 , with an error of @xmath25  mas .",
    "the relative component separation ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) increased from 1.46  mas to 1.58  mas in 1.65  yr .",
    "since the stronger component was resolved at the second epoch , its centroid could have shifted in absolute position ; we estimate a @xmath26 upper limit to this shift that is equal to the component size of 0.16  mas . adding this error in quadrature to the nominal position errors",
    ", we find a proper motion of @xmath27  mas  yr@xmath4 , for an apparent speed ( in units of @xmath28 ) of @xmath29 .",
    "the implied epoch of zero separation is @xmath30 , so the secondary might have had its genesis during a strong flux outburst in early 1982 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total flux density of @xmath31  mjy at 1997.10 was slightly smaller than the flux density of @xmath32  mjy measured at 1995.26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "mrk  348 since has undergone a major radio flare , with the southern component increasing by a factor of 5.5 between 1997.10 and 1998.75 , strongly suggesting that it is the galaxy nucleus .",
    "this is similar to the more extreme flares in iii  zw  2 , which are discussed by falcke et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the redshift of mrk  231 is @xmath33 ( @xcite ) , and the corresponding scale is 0.93  pc  mas@xmath4 .",
    "mrk  231 is a seyfert 1/starburst galaxy with a heavily obscured nucleus and a total infrared luminosity of @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it contains a 40-pc north - south radio source ( @xcite ; @xcite ) embedded within a starburst several hundred parsecs in extent ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our vlba images ( figure  [ fig:231-im ] ) show a double source with a position angle differing by about 65  from the larger scale source .",
    "the second - epoch phase - referenced j2000 position ( @xmath352336 , @xmath36245 ) is consistent within the 12-mas error with that previously listed by patnaik et al .",
    "the increase in component separation ( table  [ tab : prop ] ) results in a measured proper motion of @xmath37  mas  yr@xmath4 , or @xmath38 , with a zero - separation epoch of @xmath39 .",
    "variability by a factor of 2.5 between epochs indicates that the weaker , northeastern component is the actual nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "parsec - scale radio sources have now been imaged in several seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in ngc  1068",
    ", the parsec - scale source is believed to represent thermal emission from the accretion torus ( gallimore et al .",
    "however , the brightness temperatures in mrk  348 and mrk  231 are too high for thermal emission , and instead suggest association of the radio components with outflowing jets .",
    "strong variability in one component in each galaxy indicates that it is close to the active nucleus , and that the double sources represent one - sided jets rather than straddling the galaxy nuclei .",
    "one - sided radio structures often are caused by relativistic jets having speed @xmath40 and pointing at a small angle @xmath41 with respect to the observer s line of sight ( for equations , see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume an intrinsic spectral index of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for the off - nuclear components . in mrk 348 , therefore",
    ", the observed jet / counterjet ratio of @xmath44 , together with @xmath45 , can be due to relativistic boosting only if @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "however , the inner disk is edge - on ( @xcite ) , and the half - angle of the ionization cone is @xmath4845  ( @xcite ) ; if the radio jet is inside that cone , @xmath49 , inconsistent with motion near the line of sight . in mrk  231 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , requiring @xmath52 and @xmath47 for doppler boosting to account for the one - sided source .",
    "if the radio axis is perpendicular to the 100-pc - scale disk ( @xcite ; carilli et al .",
    "1998 ) , then @xmath53 , also inconsistent with motion at a very small viewing angle .",
    "the above arguments depend on two assumptions : ( 1 ) the jets flow along the axes of the inner disks , as they apparently do in ngc  1068 ( gallimore et al .",
    "1997 ) and ngc  4258 ( @xcite ) ; and ( 2 ) the measured speeds represent the actual jet speeds , rather than quasi - stationary structures ( such as shocks ) through which faster jets flow .",
    "the interpretation of fast jets moving through slower shocks has been made for centaurus  a , with @xmath54 , based on the internal evolution of radio components ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in mrk  231 and mrk  348 , the structures of the off - nuclear components are consistent between the two epochs , so there is no similar evidence for higher flow speeds .",
    "a straightforward explanation for the one - sided sources is that the `` missing '' components are in the receding jet and are free - free absorbed by ionized gas .",
    "the optical depth at frequency @xmath55 is @xmath56 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath57 is the temperature in kelvin and @xmath58 is the emission measure in @xmath59  pc .",
    "optical depths of @xmath60 are needed in order to account for the observed jet / counterjet ratios . assuming a line - of - sight distance of @xmath61  pc through the ionized gas , and a gas temperature of 8000  k",
    ", the average ionized densities would be @xmath62  @xmath6 at 0.51  pc from the galaxy nuclei .",
    "the resulting column densities of @xmath63  @xmath64 are remarkably consistent with the measured x - ray absorption columns in mrk  348 ( @xcite ) and in mrk  231 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the density also is consistent with that found for possible absorption in a warm , weakly ionized medium in the h@xmath12o - maser galaxy ngc  2639 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the absorption comes from a much hotter gas having @xmath9  k , the average density required would be @xmath65  @xmath6 .",
    "these values are close to those inferred from the image of the torus radio emission in ngc  1068 ( gallimore et al .",
    "1997 ) ; such disk emission in mrk  231 and mrk  348 is possible , since it would not be detectable by our observations , due to inadequate resolution and brightness - temperature sensitivity .",
    "the free - free - absorption interpretation requires ionized gas densities of @xmath66@xmath67  @xmath6 in the inner parsec of mrk  231 and mrk  348 .",
    "these are higher than the values of @xmath68  @xmath6 inferred from the absorption @xmath69  pc from the nucleus of 3c  84 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath70  @xmath6 inferred for absorption 1520  pc from the nucleus of mrk  231 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with the presence of disks or tori having ionized densities that fall gradually from @xmath66@xmath67  @xmath6 in the inner parsec of the galaxies to @xmath71  @xmath6 at @xmath16  pc from the nuclei .",
    "even though no h@xmath12o maser emission has been detected in mrk  231 or mrk  348 ( @xcite ) , possibly because of our viewing angle , the one - sided sub - relativistic jets are consistent with the presence of megamaser disks .",
    "if @xmath72 , the absorbing gas may become optically thin near 30  ghz , and counterjets might be detectable in very sensitive vlbi observations at 43  ghz .",
    "the apparently low jet speeds in mrk  231 and mrk  348 are similar to those seen on parsec scales in some weak fanaroff - riley i ( @xcite ) radio galaxies such as centaurus  a ( @xcite ) and 3c  84 ( @xcite )",
    ". however , most such objects are relativistic on parsec scales ( @xcite ) , as are most strong radio galaxies and quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the apparently sub - relativistic seyfert jet speeds on the same scale may be due to interactions with the small - scale gas , or to physics directly related to the energy source , such as low black - hole spin rates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    both mrk  348 and mrk  231 , as well as ngc  2639 ( @xcite ) and iii  zw  2 ( @xcite ) , have radio spectra that peak at 10  ghz or higher . thus , the seyfert radio sources have general characteristics similar to compact symmetric objects ( csos ) , which display gigahertz - peaked spectra , symmetric radio sources on scales of @xmath73  pc , and one - sided jets on scales of 10  pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "small - scale seyfert jet speeds also are similar to those measured in csos at 50100  pc from their nuclei ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cso jets are one - sided at 15  ghz ( taylor et al .",
    "1996 ) , and even at 43  ghz ( taylor , private communication ) , on scales of 10  pc ; at least one cso also shows patchy hi absorption on similar scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "we speculate that free - free absorption with column densities near @xmath74  @xmath64 might cause one - sided structures in some csos , if their disks are larger and denser than in seyferts .",
    "high - energy x - ray spectral studies could be used to search for absorption due to this gas .",
