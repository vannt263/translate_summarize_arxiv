    "detection of low frequency ( below 100 mhz ) gravitational waves ( lfgw ) is a challenging endeavour because terrestrial instruments are dominated by seismic noise in this frequency range .",
    "there is not much hope of isolating the noise in this frequency range , which mainly arises from the direct newtonian coupling of ground motions with the test masses .",
    "this is why space missions have been given serious considerations from early on , because lfgw are extremely important in the physics of and around massive black holes which are hosted by most of galaxies , including ours .",
    "the lisa mission @xcite involves three spacecraft forming a triangle of side @xmath4 km , linked by optical beams .",
    "the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal is read from the beat note generated between an incoming beam and the local laser , so that six such signals are generated between the three pairs of spacecraft . in a classical michelson interferometer ,",
    "the requirements on the laser phase noise are strongly reduced by the symmetry between the two arms . in the case of lisa",
    ", a comparison of the laser beam from a distant spacecraft with the local oscillator would demand a relative frequency stability better than the gw amplitude , which is quite unrealistic .",
    "this was realised from the very beginning .",
    "the idea which allows relaxing the requirement of frequency stability is to digitally reproduce an interferometric configuration by mixing the six elementary data flows with delays corresponding to virtual optical paths between spacecrafts .",
    "the corresponding technique is called time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) @xcite .",
    "but the practical realisation of a triangular configuration orbiting the sun leads to a structure only approximately rigid .",
    "in fact , the three spacecraft are on almost circular orbits of small eccentricity @xmath5 , and the mutual distances are constant during the year only to the first order in @xmath5",
    ". when an exact calculation of the mutual distances between pairs of spacecraft is performed using keplerian orbital equations , a ` breathing ' motion of the arms appears , normally termed as ` flexing ' of the arms , with amplitude of about 115,000 km .",
    "this relative motion between spacecraft causes a doppler effect , but at frequency ( @xmath6 hz ) out of the detection band @xmath7 hz .",
    "it has nevertheless been shown @xcite that this motion makes the delay operators of tdi , variable in time and thus prevents the exact cancellation of the laser frequency noise .",
    "one can however , suppress the noise but at the cost of complex application of tdi techniques involving noncommuting delay operators . when first generation tdi combinations are used , the residual noise is proportional to the time derivative of the flexing , so that a significant reduction of the slow orbital doppler effect would make it necessary to reconsider the tdi strategy .",
    "we have found it useful , therefore , to discuss the stability of the lisa triangle to higher orders in @xmath5 instead of only to the first order , in order to investigate whether better orbits are possible , with reduced breathing amplitude .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sc:2 ] , we firstly show that a small correction to the angle between the lisa plane and the ecliptic is able to reduce by a factor @xmath3 the rms flexing amplitude and more importantly the peak to peak doppler shift by a factor @xmath8 which is relevant for tdi . in section [ sc:3 ]",
    "we show how a generalisation of the clohessy - wiltshire equations up to second order , namely , the octupolar expansion of the newtonian potential and the related geodesic deviation , allows us to reproduce almost exactly the behaviour as obtained from the exact orbits .",
    "this paves for us a natural way for introducing extra degrees of freedom in the orbital model in order to establish the optimality of the solution we have found . in section [ sc:4 ]",
    ", we achieve this by obtaining the general solution to the second order equations and vary the arbitrary constants to arrive at the optimal results . in this analysis , for simplicity",
    ", we have ignored the effects of the gravitational pulls of jupiter and earth which are of the same order .",
    "we note that the flexing occurs mainly due to two reasons : ( i ) the non - existence of exact keplerian orbits of spacecraft allowing constant arm - lengths , and ( ii ) the perturbation due to planets in our solar system . in this paper",
    "we address the first issue only .",
    "the lisa mission requires that the distances between the three spacecraft remain constant to the first order in the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is proportional to the eccentricity @xmath5 to the first order : @xmath11 to this order in @xmath5 .",
    "we take @xmath12 km and @xmath13 a. u. @xmath14 km , and thus @xmath15 .",
    "the constancy of armlengths alone does not lead to a unique choice of the orbits .",
    "it has been shown that all the points around a circular reference orbit , in a plane making an angle of @xmath16 with respect to the plane of reference orbit satisfies the above condition@xcite . however , all these orbits have different arm length variation to the second order in @xmath17 , also known as flexing . in reference",
    "@xcite ( henceforth referred to as paper i ) , we have presented a set of elliptical orbits satisfying the above requirement . here",
    "we extend our analysis to second order in @xmath17 which describes the flexing of the arms quite accurately .",
    "we show this by comparing the second order results with the exact results which agree to within few parts in @xmath18 .",
    "thus the second order analysis allows us to handle the flexing in a convenient and reliable manner .",
    "the eventual aim of this excercise is to minimise the flexing which could be important for the exploitation of lisa .    for this purpose",
    "we need to decide on the measure of flexing .",
    "there are several ways of characterising this quantity .",
    "we can take this to be the peak to peak variation of the armlength - the difference between the maximum distance between two given spacecraft and the minimum distance between the two spacecraft over the period of one year ; or we can define it as a r.m.s variation of armlength over the period of a year .",
    "an important measure is the doppler shift which depends on the relative velocity between two spacecraft .",
    "we investigate all these measures of flexing in this paper .",
    "we also make the simplifying assumption that the orbits of the spacecrafts 2 and 3 are obtained by rigidly rotating the orbit of spacecraft 1 by @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( this is described more precisely in the next subsection ) . due to the symmetry assumed in this model , the measures of flexing although different from each other are independent of the spacecraft pair we choose .",
    "therefore without loss of generality we consider spacecraft 1 and spacecraft 2 .",
    "if @xmath21 is the distance between the spacecraft 1 and 2 at time @xmath22 , then the peak to peak flexing is equal to @xmath23 , where the maxima and minima are taken over the period of one year .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 are time - shifted versions of @xmath26 by one third and two thirds of an year respectively .",
    "the goal of this section is to explore the possibility of reducing the flexing by tweaking the orbital parameters of the spacecraft orbits .",
    "one way is to vary the tilt of the plane of lisa and study the effect on the arm length variation as a function of the tilt angle and then minimise the flexing by appropriately choosing the tilt .",
    "we show that the flexing can be reduced by appropriately choosing the tilt and the flexing can be reduced to a minimum .",
    "the generic problem involves exploring the space of orbital parameters of the three spacecraft orbits . because of the symmetry assumed here , we are restricting ourselves to a subspace , whose dimensionality is smaller by a factor of three than the dimensionality of the full parameter space of orbits .",
    "following paper i , we start with the exact orbital equations .",

    "if we do not apriori assume that @xmath166 is zero , then the simple analysis as performed above , fails .",

    "a straight forward numerical computation shows that the minimum value of @xmath170 occurs when @xmath179 and @xmath180 , giving the minimum peak variation of @xmath2 km as before .",

    "in this work we have studied the variation of the lengths of the arms of lisa in the neighbourhood of the exact solution that gives constant armlengths to first order in @xmath10 .",

    "we numerically establish that the second order results provide a near accurate description of the orbits and the flexing of the arms .",

    "we show that by slightly changing the tilt angle of the plane of lisa from the proposed one of @xmath1 with the ecliptic , one can reduce the flexing of the arms .",
    "this is investigated with the aid of the exact keplerian orbits as well as by analysing to second order in @xmath10 .",

    "we find that the peak to peak amplitude of flexing is reduced by a factor of about 2.4 .",
    "more importantly , in the context of application of tdi techniques , we show that the peak to peak doppler shift is reduced by a factor of 5.6 .",
    "secondly , we obtain the equations of motion to second order in @xmath10 from the newtonian geodesic deviation equation to the quadratic order in the separation vector , which involves the octupolar expansion of the newtonian gravitational potential of the sun .",
    "these equations can also be obtained with a lagrangian approach . the general solutions to these equations",
    "are found perturbatively , in the neighbourhood of the first order solution for which the armlengths are constant to first order in @xmath10 .",
    "we then check that the family of solutions with varying tilt is reproduced from the general solution by choosing the arbitrary constants appropriately .",
    "finally we use the general solution to establish that our solution of the minimum flexing of the arms is more generally valid in the neighborhood of the exact solution assumed .",
    "this is important from the point of view of a realistic launch because the flexibility in the choice of parameters allows for some error , which is inevitable , and this is possible without sacrificing performance .",
