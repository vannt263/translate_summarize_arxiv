    "in most of the molecular conductors which exhibit metallic properties at low temperatures , charge carriers originate from molecular orbitals of one kind such as the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of a donor molecule or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of an acceptor molecule.[1 ] for example , the charge carriers of @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 originate from the homo s of bedt - ttf molecules while @xmath4 anions merely work as reservoirs of negative charges . in this type of molecular conductors , the chemical composition in principle",
    "determines the filling factor of the conduction band .    on the other hand ,",
    "charge carriers in some molecular conductors originate from two kinds of molecular orbitals ( `` two - orbital '' molecular conductors ) . here",
    "we call one of the two kinds of molecular orbitals , having the larger orbital energy , as the upper orbital ( uo ) , and the other , having the lower orbital energy , as the lower orbital ( lo ) .",
    "the energy separation between the uo and lo is denoted by @xmath5 .    a molecular conductor composed of segregated columns of donor molecules and columns of acceptor molecules , such as ttf@xmath6tcnq ,",
    "may be considered as a two - component type of the `` two - orbital '' molecular conductor .",
    "the uo and lo in this type are the lumo of an acceptor molecule and the homo of a donor molecule , respectively .",
    "another type of the `` two - orbital '' molecular conductor is a single - component one , where the uo and lo come from molecules of one kind .",
    "the salt of @xmath7_2 $ ] is classified into this type .",
    "the uo and lo in this salt are the homo and lumo of @xmath8 , respectively.[2 ] for this type , one can estimate @xmath5 approximately from the intra - molecular optical absorption for the molecule which possesses the uo and lo .",
    "the values of @xmath5 , thus determi ned for typical organic donors and acceptors , are listed in table 1 . in the `` two - orbital '' molecular conductors ,",
    "the charge transfer between the two molecular orbitals is a controllable parameter , which one can expect to enrich their properties . in order to reveal them ,",
    "we have studied a two - chain model .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes two - chained molecular orbitals interacting through the on - site coulomb repulsion is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the creation and annihilation operator of an electron at the @xmath12-th site with spin @xmath13 in the uo ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are those in the lo ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are transfer integrals ; and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the on - site coulomb repulsions .",
    "the model hamiltonian ( 1 ) consists of two hubbard chains ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and their couplings ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "if the couplings are neglected , the problem is reduced to the two hubbard models which can be solved by bethe ansatz .",
    "this approximation may be partially justified by the following considerations :    first , @xmath25 is anticipated to be unimportant until the charge transfer from the lo to the uo occurs , since @xmath18 , @xmath19 are smaller than @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and negligible compared to @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , @xmath27 where the first term is proportional to the fluctuation of electron density at each site ; the second term is proportional to the total electron number ; and the third term is on - site coulomb repulsion , which simply reduces the effective value of @xmath20 in @xmath28 and that of @xmath21 in @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , @xmath26 can be neglected until the fluctuation of electron density becomes dominant .",
    "since @xmath28 and @xmath29 are now independent , the ground state is obtained by imposing the same chemical potential to the two chains .",
    "more explicitly one can obtain the ground state energy by minimizing @xmath30+e[{\\rm   ( lo)}^{n_l}]$ ] under the condition of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 $ ] denotes the ground state energy for @xmath28 when @xmath33 electrons are in the uo , and @xmath34 $ ] denotes the corresponding energy for @xmath29 when @xmath35 electrons are in the lo .",
    "the total electron number in the system is @xmath36 .    in the following calculation",
    ", we use the ground state energy per one site for the hubbard chain .",
    "this energy , @xmath37 , was originally derived by lieb and wu:[11,12,13 ] @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) are the total number of sites and electrons ; @xmath42 ; and @xmath43 , respectively . by solving these equations we can study the range @xmath44 . for the range @xmath45 , @xmath46",
    "is given by an identical equation , @xmath47 coupled with eq.([baeq ] ) . since a closed form of ( [ baeq ] )",
    "is not known , we have obtained following functions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 which approximate @xmath46 : @xmath50 within the ansatz @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 the deviations of @xmath48 and @xmath49 from @xmath46 are about @xmath55 in the range of @xmath56 .",
    "we take @xmath57 and @xmath58 for simplicity .",
    "generalization to the other cases is straightforward . + a ) @xmath59    this is the case corresponding to the charge - transfer salts of @xmath60.[9 ] the parameter @xmath61 represents the degree of charge transfer from the lo to the uo .",
    "the ground - state energy per one site , @xmath62 , is expressed by @xmath63 in what follows , @xmath61 is determined as the value which minimizes e for a given set of @xmath64 and @xmath65 :    \\i ) if @xmath66 , we have , @xmath67 .",

    "in fact , properties of these salts are consistent with the expectation given by the extended hkel calculation where only the homo is taken into account.[14 ] + b ) @xmath70    this is the case corresponding to the charge - transfer salts of @xmath71[9 ] and @xmath72 ^ -$ ] ( m = ni , pd , pt ) .",

    "the ground state of the one - dimensional hubbard model is insulating at half filling .",
    "therefore , the two - chained hubbard model ( [ twohub ] ) predicts an insulating state at @xmath67 , metallic state for @xmath75 , and metal - insulator transition on the b oundary of these two regions .    in the case of @xmath71[9 ] salts , the value of @xmath64 is about 3.[10 ] thus , from fig 2a , one may expect that metallic state in these salts if @xmath76 .",
    "this condition is not unreasonable .",
    "in fact , mori et al recently found the metallic behavior above 160 k in ttm - ttp@xmath77 , which is a charge - transfer salt of ttm-@xmath71 .",
    "although they did not consider the possibility of the charge transfer between the lo and uo[15 ] , our calculation suggests that such charge transfer causes the metallic behavior of this salt above 160 k. + c ) @xmath78    this is the case corresponding to the charge - transfer salts of @xmath79^{0.5-}$ ] ( m = ni , pd , pt ) .",

    "it should be noted that the state @xmath85 is stable in this model , as can be seen from fig .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath88 is discontinuous at @xmath89 .",
    "the present model hamiltonian does not include any contribution from the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the interaction is expected to make the state , @xmath85 , more stable by forming a gap in the middle of the half - filled uo band ( peierls transition ) . in this sense , the dimerized structure frequently found in @xmath90 and @xmath91 salts [ 16 ] may be considered as a result of peierls transition .",
